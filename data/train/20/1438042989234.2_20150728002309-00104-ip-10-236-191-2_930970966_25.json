    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{868180=In addition, due to our desire to align measure titles with the measure titles that have been finalized for 2013, 2014, 2015, and potentially subsequent years of the EHR Incentive Program, we note that the measure titles for measures available for reporting via EHR may change. To the extent that the EHR Incentive Program updates its measure titles to include version numbers (77 FR 13744), we will use these version numbers to describe the PQRS EHR measures that will also be available for reporting for the EHR Incentive Program. We will continue to work toward complete alignment of measure specifications across programs whenever possible., 156837=In addition to the five-year reviews, beginning for CY 2009, CMS and the RUC have identified and reviewed a number of potentially misvalued codes on an annual basis based on various identification screens. This annual review of work and PE RVUs for potentially misvalued codes was supplemented by the amendments to section 1848 of the Act, as enacted by section 3134 of the Affordable Care Act, which requires the agency to periodically identify, review and adjust values for potentially misvalued codes., 900202=Furthermore, we are proposing to remove the following measures groups for reporting beginning in 2015 for the following reasons:, 457274=(a) Invasive Cardiology: Consistent with the previous MP RVU update, we continued to classify invasive cardiology services (cardiac catheterizations and angioplasties) that are outside of the surgical HCPCS code range as surgery for purposes of assigning specialty-specific risk factors. We note that since the previous MP RVU update some invasive cardiology service HCPCS codes have been revised. Therefore, we modified the list of invasive cardiology services outside the surgical HCPCS code range that are to be considered surgery in order to correspond conceptually to the list of service codes used for the CY 2010 MP RVU update. We continue to believe that the malpractice risk for cardiac catheterization and angioplasty services are more similar to the risk of surgical procedures than most nonsurgical service codes. As such, we applied the higher cardiology surgical risk factor to cardiology catheterization and angioplasty services., 822112=To be consistent with the criterion we finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive, we are proposing to modify \u00a7 414.90(j) to indicate the following criterion for the satisfactory reporting for individual eligible professionals to report measures groups via registry for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment: For the 12-month reporting period for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, the eligible professional would report at least 1 measures group AND report each measures group for at least 20 patients, the majority (11 patients) of which would be required to be Medicare Part B FFS patients. Measures groups containing a measure with a 0 percent performance rate would not be counted., 474581=An example of one possible approach would be to calculate imputed work RVUs and MP RVUs for the anesthesia fee schedule services using the work, PE, and MP shares of the anesthesia conversion factor. To reflect differences in the complexity and risk between anesthesia fee schedule services we would then multiply the service-specific risk factor for each anesthesia fee schedule service by the imputed proxy work RVUs (both CY 2015 and Cy 2016 would be based on the same work RVUs) developed for each anesthesia service to determine updated proxy MP RVUs for the CY 2016 year. The aggregate difference between the imputed MP RVUs for CY 2015 the proxy MP RVUs for CY 2016 (both based on the same work RVUs) would be applied to the portion of the anesthesia conversion factor attributable to MP. However, we believe there may be drawbacks to this approach since it relies heavily on the proxy work and MP RVUs for individual anesthesia services. We are requesting public comments on this approach specifically, as well as comments on alternative approaches or methods for updating MP for services paid on the anesthesia fee schedule., 294248=Since CY 2009, as a part of the annual potentially misvalued code review and the five-year review process, we have reviewed over 1,250 potentially misvalued codes to refine work RVUs and direct PE inputs. We have assigned appropriate work RVUs and direct PE inputs for these services as a result of these reviews. A more detailed discussion of the extensive prior reviews of potentially misvalued codes is included in the CY 2012 PFS final rule with comment period (76 FR 73052 through 73055). In the CY 2012 final rule with comment period, we finalized our policy to consolidate the review of physician work and PE at the same time (76 FR 73055 through 73958), and established a process for the annual public nomination of potentially misvalued services., 325682=As we considered the concerns raised regarding the CY 2014 payment changes for the epidural injection procedures, we looked at the values for other injection procedures. Other injection procedures, including some recommended by commenters for use as a reference in valuing these epidural injection codes, include the work and PEs of image guidance in the injection code. For example, transforaminal injections, CPT codes 64479 (Injection(s), anesthetic agent and/or steroid, transforaminal epidural, with imaging guidance (fluoroscopy or CT); cervical or thoracic, single level), 64480 (Injection(s), anesthetic agent and/or steroid, transforaminal epidural, with imaging guidance (fluoroscopy or CT); cervical or thoracic, each additional level (List separately in addition to code for primary procedure)), 64483 (Injection(s), anesthetic agent and/or steroid, transforaminal epidural, with imaging guidance (fluoroscopy or CT); lumbar or sacral, single level) and 64484 (Injection(s), anesthetic agent and/or steroid, transforaminal epidural, with imaging guidance (fluoroscopy or CT); lumbar or sacral, each additional level (List separately in addition to code for primary procedure)) include the image guidance in the injection code. Similarly, the paravertebral injections, CPT code 64490 (Injection(s), diagnostic or therapeutic agent, paravertebral facet (zygapophyseal) joint (or nerves innervating that joint) with image guidance (fluoroscopy or CT), cervical or thoracic; single level), 64491 (Injection(s), diagnostic or therapeutic agent, paravertebral facet (zygapophyseal) joint (or nerves innervating that joint) with image guidance (fluoroscopy or CT), cervical or thoracic; second level (List separately in addition to code for primary procedure)), 64492 (Injection(s), diagnostic or therapeutic agent, paravertebral facet (zygapophyseal) joint (or nerves innervating that joint) with image guidance (fluoroscopy or CT), cervical or thoracic; third and any additional level(s) (List separately in addition to code for primary procedure)), 64493 (Injection(s), diagnostic or therapeutic agent, paravertebral facet (zygapophyseal) joint (or nerves innervating that joint) with image guidance (fluoroscopy or CT), lumbar or sacral; single level), 64494 (Injection(s), diagnostic or therapeutic agent, paravertebral facet (zygapophyseal) joint (or nerves innervating that joint) with image guidance (fluoroscopy or CT), lumbar or sacral; second level (List separately in addition to code for the primary procedure)) and 64495 (Injection(s), diagnostic or therapeutic agent, paravertebral facet (zygapophyseal) joint (or nerves innervating that joint) with image guidance (fluoroscopy or CT), lumbar or sacral; third and any additional level(s)(List separately in addition to code for primary procedure)) each include the image guidance bundled in the injection CPT code., 657088=We believe that the most current OMB statistical area delineations, coupled with the updated RUCA codes, more accurately reflect the contemporary urban and rural nature of areas across the country, and thus we believe that use of the most current OMB delineations and RUCA codes under the ambulance fee schedule would enhance the accuracy of ambulance fee schedule payments. We invite comments on our proposal to implement the new OMB delineations and the updated RUCA codes as discussed above beginning in CY 2015, for purposes of payment under the Medicare ambulance fee schedule., 307719=We are proposing the approximately 65 codes listed in Table 10 as potentially misvalued codes as a prioritized subset of codes of the newly established statutory category, \u201ccodes that account for the majority of spending under the physician fee schedule.\u201d As we identify potentially misvalued codes, we prioritize codes that are important to the Medicare program and its beneficiaries, and codes that account for a high level of Medicare expenditures meet this criterion. However, through our usual identification potentially misvalued codes it is possible to miss certain services that are important to a segment of Medicare practitioners and beneficiaries because the specialty that typically furnishes the service does not have high volume relative to the overall PFS utilization. To capture such services in developing this list, we looked at high expenditure services by specialty using a similar approach to the one we used in CY 2012. We believe it is appropriate to repeat this type of analysis periodically., 860860=In addition to section 1848(k)(2)(C) of the Act, section 1890A of the Act, which was added by section 3014(b) of the Affordable Care Act, requires that the Secretary establish a pre-rulemaking process under which certain steps occur with respect to the selection of certain categories of quality and efficiency measures, one of which is that the entity with a contract with the Secretary under section 1890(a) of the Act (that is, the NQF) convene multi-stakeholder groups to provide input to the Secretary on the selection of such measures. These categories are described in section 1890(b)(7)(B) of the Act, and include such measures as the quality measures selected for reporting under the PQRS. In accordance with section 1890A(a)(1) of the Act, the NQF convened multi-stakeholder groups by creating the Measure Applications Partnership (MAP). Section 1890A(a)(2) of the Act requires that the Secretary must make publicly available by December 1st of each year a list of the quality and efficiency measures that the Secretary is considering for selection through rulemaking for use in the Medicare program. The NQF must provide CMS with the MAP's input on the selection of measures by February 1st of each year. The lists of measures under consideration for selection through rulemaking in 2014 are available at http://www.qualityforum.org/map/., 278472=In addition to soliciting comments as noted above, we continue to seek a better understanding regarding the growing trend toward hospital acquisition of physician offices and subsequent treatment of those locations as off-campus provider-based outpatient departments affects payments under PFS and beneficiary cost-sharing. MedPAC continues to question the appropriateness of increased Medicare payment and beneficiary cost-sharing when physician offices become hospital outpatient departments, and to recommend that Medicare pay selected hospital outpatient services at PFS rates (MedPAC March 2012 and June 2013 Report to Congress). We also remain concerned about the validity of the resource data as more physician practices become provider-based. Our survey data reflects the PE costs for particular PFS specialties, including a proportion of practices that may have become provider-based since the survey was conducted. Additionally, as the proportion of provider-based offices varies among physician specialties, so does the relative accuracy of the PE survey data. Our current PE methodology primarily distinguishes between the resources involved in furnishing services in two sites of service: The non-facility setting and the facility setting. In principle, when services are furnished in the non-facility setting, the costs associated with furnishing services include all direct and indirect PEs associated with the work and the PE of the service. In contrast, when services are furnished in the facility setting, some costs that would be PEs in the office setting are incurred by the facility. Medicare makes a separate payment to the facility to account for some portion of these costs, and we adjust PEs accordingly under the PFS. As more physician practices become hospital-based, it is difficult to know which PE costs typically are actually incurred by the physician, which are incurred by the hospital, and whether our bifurcated site-of service differential adequately accounts for the typical resource costs given these relationships. We also have addressed this issue as it relates to accurate valuation of visits within the post-operative period of 10- and 90-day global codes in section II.B.4 of this proposed rule., 350091=CMS supports bundled payments as a mechanism to incentivize high-quality, efficient care. Although on the surface, the PFS global codes appear to function as bundled payments similar to those Medicare uses to make single payments for multiple services to hospitals under the inpatient and outpatient prospective payment systems, the practical reality is that these global codes function significantly differently than other bundled payments. First, the global surgical codes were established several decades ago when surgical follow-up care was far more homogenous than today. Today, there is more diversity in the kind of procedures covered by global periods, the settings in which the procedures and the follow-up care are furnished, the health care delivery system and business arrangements used by Medicare practitioners, and the care needs of Medicare beneficiaries. Despite these changes, the basic structures of the global surgery packages are the same as the packages that existed prior to the creation of the resource-based relative value system in 1992. Another significant difference between this and other typical models of bundled payments is that the payment rates for the global surgery packages are not updated regularly based on any reporting of the actual costs of patient care. For example, the hospital inpatient and outpatient prospective payment systems (the IPPS and OPPS, respectively) derive payment rates from hospital cost and charge data reported through annual Medicare hospital cost reports and the most recent year of claims data available for an inpatient stay or primary outpatient service. Because payment rates are based on consistently updated data, over time, payment rates adjust to reflect the average resource costs of current practice. Similarly, many of the new demonstration and innovation models track costs and make adjustments to payments. Another significant difference is that payment for the PFS global packages relies on valuing the combined services together. This means that there are no separate PFS values established for the procedures or the follow-up care, making it difficult to estimate the costs of the individual global code component services., 330890=Because it is clear that the proposed PE inputs for the epidural injection codes include items that are specifically related to image guidance, such as the radiographic fluoroscopic room, we believe separate reporting of the image guidance codes would overestimate the resources used in furnishing the two services together. To avoid this situation, we are also proposing to prohibit the billing of image guidance codes in conjunction with these four epidural injection codes. We believe our two-tiered proposal to utilize CY 2013 input values for this code family, while prohibiting the separate billing of imaging guidance codes in conjunction with epidural injection, would best ensure that appropriate reimbursement continues to be made while we gather additional information and consider the best way to value these services., 146835=Since January 1, 1992, Medicare has paid for physicians' services under section 1848 of the Act, \u201cPayment for Physicians' Services.\u201d The system relies on national relative values that are established for work, PE, and MP, which are adjusted for geographic cost variations. These values are multiplied by a conversion factor (CF) to convert the RVUs into payment rates. The concepts and methodology underlying the PFS were enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (101, enacted on December 19, 1989) (OBRA '89), and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (101, enacted on November 5, 1990) (OBRA '90). The final rule published on November 25, 1991 (56 FR 59502) set forth the first fee schedule used for payment for physicians' services., 236213=We note that the RUC exempted certain procedures from its recommendation because (a) the dominant specialty indicated that digital technology is not yet typical or (b) the procedure only contained a single input associated with film technology, and it was determined that the sharing of images, but not actual imaging, may be involved in the service. However, we do not believe that the most appropriate approach in establishing relative values for services that involve imaging is to exempt services from the transition from film to digital PE inputs based on information reported by individual specialties. Although we understand that the migration from film technology to digital technology may progress at different paces for particular specialties, we do not have information to suggest that the migration is not occurring for all procedures that require the storage of images. Just as it was appropriate to use film inputs as a proxy for some services for which digital inputs were typical pending these proposed changes in the direct PE input database, we believe it is appropriate to use digital inputs as a proxy for the services that may still use film, pending their migration to digital technology. In addition, since the RUC conducted its collection of information from the specialties over several years, we believe the migration process from film to digital inputs has likely continued over the time period during which the information was gathered, and that the digital PE inputs will reflect typical use of technology for most if not all of these services before the proposed change to digital inputs would take effect beginning January 1, 2015. We also believe that for the sake of relativity, we should remove the equipment and supply inputs noted below from all procedures in the direct PE database, including those listed in Table 7. We seek comment on whether the computer workstation, which we propose to use as a proxy for the PACS workstation, is the appropriate input for the services listed in Table 7, or whether an alternative input is a more appropriate reflection of direct PE costs., 807756=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, in accordance with the submission deadline of quality measures data for qualified registries, we noted a deadline of the last Friday in February occurring after the end of the applicable reporting period to submit quality measures data to CMS (78 FR 74471). In accordance with our proposal to extend this deadline for qualified registries, we propose to extend the deadline for QCDRs to submit quality measures data calculations and results by March 31 following the end of the applicable reporting period (that is, March 31, 2016, for reporting periods occurring in 2015)., 116998=2.

L. 105-33), 592438=However, a recent study in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) cited an increase in the percentage of colonoscopies and upper endoscopy procedures furnished using an anesthesia professional, from 13.5 percent in 2003 to 30.2 percent in 2009 within the Medicare population, with a similar increase in the commercially-insured population.2 A 2010 study projected that the percentage of this class of procedures involving an anesthesia professional would grow to 53.4 percent by 2015.3 These studies suggest that the prevailing standard of care for endoscopies in general and screening colonoscopies in particular is undergoing a transition, and that anesthesia separately provided by an anesthesia professional is becoming the prevalent practice. After reviewing these studies, we analyzed Medicare claims data and found that the same trend was observed in screening colonoscopies for Medicare beneficiaries. We found that in 53 percent of screening colonoscopies for which Medicare claims were submitted in 2013 a separate anesthesia claim was reported., 430711=Calculation of the proposed MP RVUs conceptually follows the specialty-weighted approach used in the CY 2010 final rule with comment period (74 FR 61758). The specialty-weighted approach bases the MP RVUs for a given service upon a weighted average of the risk factors of all specialties furnishing the service. This approach ensures that all specialties furnishing a given service are accounted for in the calculation of the MP RVUs. The steps for calculating the proposed MP RVUs are described below., 52574=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 175071=We use survey data on indirect PEs incurred per hour worked in developing the indirect portion of the PE RVUs. Prior to CY 2010, we primarily used the practice expense per hour (PE/HR) by specialty that was obtained from the AMA's Socioeconomic Monitoring Surveys (SMS). The AMA administered a new survey in CY 2007 and CY 2008, the Physician Practice Expense Information Survey (PPIS). The PPIS is a multispecialty, nationally representative, PE survey of both physicians and nonphysician practitioners (NPPs) paid under the PFS using a survey instrument and methods highly consistent with those used for the SMS and the supplemental surveys. The PPIS gathered information from 3,656 respondents across 51 physician specialty and health care professional groups. We believe the PPIS is the most comprehensive source of PE survey information available. We used the PPIS data to update the PE/HR data for the CY 2010 PFS for almost all of the Medicare-recognized specialties that participated in the survey., 223356=We received a recommendation from the RUC regarding appropriate clinical labor minutes for post-procedure moderate sedation monitoring and post-procedure monitoring. The RUC recommended 15 minutes of RN time for one hour of monitoring following moderate sedation and 15 minutes of RN time per hour for post-procedure monitoring (unrelated to moderate sedation). For 17 procedures listed in Table 5, the recommended clinical labor minutes differed from the clinical labor minutes in the direct PE database. We propose to accept, without refinement, the RUC recommendation to adjust these clinical labor minutes as indicated in Table 5 as \u201cChange to Clinical Labor Time.\u201d The CY 2015 direct PE database reflects these proposed changes and is available on the CMS Web site under the supporting data files for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/., 155893=Although refinements to the direct PE inputs initially relied heavily on input from the RUC Practice Expense Advisory Committee (PEAC), the shifts to the bottom-up PE methodology in CY 2007 and to the use of the updated PE/HR data in CY 2010 have resulted in significant refinements to the PE RVUs in recent years., 274708=Section 220(a) of the PAMA added a new subparagraph (M) under section 1848(c)(2) of the Act that gives us authority to collect information on resources used to furnish services from eligible professionals (including physicians, non-physician practitioners, PTs, OTs, SLPs and qualified audiologists), and other sources. It also authorizes us to pay eligible professionals for submitting solicited information. We will be exploring ways of collecting better and updated resource data from physician practices, including those that are provider-based, and other non-facility entities paid through the PFS. We believe such efforts will be challenging given the wide variety of practices, and that any effort will likely impose some burden on eligible professionals paid through the PFS regardless of the scope and manner of data collection. Currently, through one of the validation contracts discussed in section II.B. of this proposed rule, we have been gathering time data directly from physician practices. Through this project, we have learned much about the challenges for both CMS and the eligible professionals of collecting data directly from practices. Our experience has also shown that is difficult to obtain invoices for supply and equipment items that we can use in pricing direct PE inputs. Many specialty societies also have noted the challenges in obtaining recent invoices for medical supplies and equipment (78 FR 74249). Further, PE calculations also rely heavily on information from the Physician Practice Expense Information Survey (PPIS) survey, which, as discussed earlier, was conducted in 2007 and 2008. When we implemented the results of the survey, many in the community expressed serious concerns over the accuracy of this or other PE surveys as a way of gathering data on PE inputs from the diversity of providers paid under the PFS., 305574=CPT code 41530 (submucosal ablation of the tongue base, radiofrequency, 1 or more sites, per session) was nominated for review as a potentially misvalued code. The nominator stated that CPT code 41530 is misvalued because there have been changes in the PE items used in furnishing the service. The nominator specifically requested that the SD109 probe (probe, radiofrequency, 3 array (StarBurstSDE)) be replaced with a more typically used probe, which costs less, and that a replacement be used for equipment code EQ214 (radiofrequency generator) to reflect a more appropriate input based on current invoices. We are proposing this code as a potentially misvalued code., 1007516=Additionally, we noted that, with respect to the following measure CMS140v2, Breast Cancer Hormonal Therapy for Stage IC-IIIC Estrogen Receptor/Progesterone Receptor (ER/PR) Positive Breast Cancer (NQF 0387), a substantive error was discovered in the June 2013 version of this electronically specified clinical quality measure (78 FR 74757). If an EP chooses to report this measure electronically under the EHR Incentive Program in CY 2014, the prior, December 2012 version of the measure, which is CMS140v1, must be used (78 FR 74757). Since a more recent and corrected version of this measure has been developed, we will require the reporting of the most recent, updated version of the measure Breast Cancer Hormonal Therapy for Stage IC-IIIC Estrogen Receptor/Progesterone Receptor (ER/PR) Positive Breast Cancer (NQF 0387), if an EP chooses to report the measure electronically in CY 2015., 338095=After considering the issue, we are proposing G0389 as a potentially misvalued code and seeking recommendations regarding the appropriate inputs that should be used to develop RVUs for this code. We have not reviewed the inputs used to develop RVUs for this code since it was established in CY 2007 and the RVUs were directly crosswalked from 76705. Based on the issues raised by stakeholders, we believe that we should value this code through our standard methodologies, including the full PE RVU methodology. In order to do so, we are proposing to include this code on our list of proposed potentially misvalued codes and seek input from the public and other stakeholders, including the RUC, regarding the appropriate work RVU, time, and direct PE inputs that reflect the typical resources involved in furnishing the service., 122467=Rashaan Byers, (410) 786-2305, for issues related to physician compare., 414201=It appears that practice patterns for endoscopic procedures are changing, and anesthesia is increasingly being separately reported for these procedures. For example, one study shows that while the use of a separate anesthesia professional for colonoscopies and upper endoscopies was just 13.5 percent in 2003, the rate more than doubled to 30.2 percent in 2009. An analysis of Medicare claims data shows that a similar pattern is occurring in the Medicare program. We find that, for certain types of procedures such as digestive surgical procedures, a separate anesthesia service is furnished 53 percent of the time. For some of these digestive surgical procedures, the claims analysis shows that this rate is as high as 80 percent., 683698=In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of certain aspects of the LCD implementation process, we are also examining a pilot project that CMS launched with a single MAC, Palmetto GBA, on November 1, 2011. While the pilot discussed in this section only includes molecular diagnostic (genetic) laboratory tests, a subset of all clinical diagnostic lab tests, we believe the pilot's design and some of the lessons learned from the pilot can be applied to all clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, 787144=In the CY 2013 and 2014 PFS final rules with comment period, we established certain requirements for entities to become qualified registries for the purpose of verifying that a qualified registry is prepared to submit data on PQRS quality measures for the reporting period in which the qualified registry seeks to be qualified (77 FR 69179 through 69180 and 78 FR 74456). Specifically, in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, in accordance with the satisfactory reporting criterion we finalized for individual eligible professionals or group practices reporting PQRS quality measures via qualified registry, we finalized the following requirement that a qualified registry must be able to collect all needed data elements and transmit to CMS the data at the TIN/NPI level for at least 9 measures covering at least 3 of the National Quality Strategy (NQS) domains (78 FR 74456)., 247778=The CY 2015 direct PE database reflects these proposed changes and is available on the CMS Web site under the supporting data files for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/., 552112=Following enactment of section 1848(c)(2)(K) of the Act, which required the Secretary periodically to review potentially misvalued codes and make appropriate adjustments to the RVUs, we reassessed the refinement panel process. As detailed in the CY 2011 PFS final rule with comment period (75 FR 73306), we continued using the established refinement panel process with some modifications., 839560=For registry reporting in the GPRO, in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (see Table 49 at 78 FR 74486), we finalized the following satisfactory reporting criteria for the submission of individual quality measures via registry for group practices comprised of 2 or more eligible professionals in the GPRO for the 2014 PQRS incentive: Report at least 9 measures, covering at least 3 of the NQS domains, OR, if less than 9 measures covering at least 3 NQS domains apply to the group practice, report 1\u20148 measures covering 1-3 NQS domains for which there is Medicare patient data, AND report each measure for at least 50 percent of the group practice's Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies. Measures with a 0 percent performance rate would not be counted. In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we signaled that it was \u201cour intent to ramp up the criteria for satisfactory reporting for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment to be on par or more stringent than the criteria for satisfactory reporting for the 2014 PQRS incentive\u201d (78 FR 74465)., 385948=While we believe these are plausible options for the revaluation of these services, we believe there may be others. Therefore, we seek input on the best approach to achieve this proposed transition from 10- and 90-day, to 0-day global periods, including the timing of the changes, the means for revaluation, and the most effective and least burdensome means to collect objective, representative data regarding the actual number of visits currently furnished in the post-operative global periods. We also seek comment on whether the effective date for the transition to 0-day global periods should be staggered across families of codes or other categories. For example, while we are proposing to transition 10-day global periods in 2017 and 90-day global periods in 2018, we seek comment on whether we should consider implementing the transition more or less quickly and over one or several years. We also seek comment regarding the appropriate valuation of new, revised, or potentially misvalued 10- or 90-day global codes before implementation of this proposal., 515614=In the CY 2012 rulemaking process, we proposed and finalized consolidation of the five-year review and the potentially misvalued code activities into an annual review of potentially misvalued codes in order to avoid redundancies in these efforts and better accomplish our goal of assuring regular assessment of code values. Under the consolidated process, we issue interim final RVUs for all revaluations and new codes in the PFS final rule with comment period, and make payment based upon those values during the calendar year covered by the final rule. (Changes in the PFS methodology that may affect valuations of a variety of codes are issued as proposals in the proposed rule). We consider and respond to any public comments on the interim final values in the final rule with comment period for the subsequent year. When consolidating these processes, we indicated that it was appropriate to establish interim values for new, revised and potentially misvalued codes because of the incongruity between the PFS rulemaking cycle and the release of codes by the AMA CPT Editorial Panel and the RUC review process. We stated that if we did not establish interim final values for revalued codes in the final rule with comment period, \u201ca delay in implementing revised values for codes that have been identified as misvalued would perpetuate payment for the services at a rate that does not appropriately reflect the relative resources involved in furnishing the service and would continue unwarranted distortion in the payment for other services across the PFS.\u201d We also reiterated that if we did not establish interim final values for new and revised codes, we would either have to delay the use of new and revised codes for one year, or permit each Medicare contractor to establish its own payment rate for these codes. We stated, \u201cWe believe it would be contrary to the public interest to delay adopting values for new and revised codes for the initial year, especially since we have an opportunity to receive significant input from the medical community [through the RUC] before adopting the values, and the alternatives could produce undesirable levels of uncertainty and inconsistency in payment for a year.\u201d, 490848=Practitioners furnishing Medicare telehealth services are reminded that the telehealth service provision is subject to the same non-discrimination laws as other services, including the effective communication requirements for persons with disabilities of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and language access for persons with limited English proficiency, as required under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. For more information, see http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/resources/specialtopics/hosptialcommunication., 552582=As we consider changes to the processes for valuing codes, we are reassessing the role that the refinement panel process plays in the code valuation process. As we note in the discussion above, the current refinement panel process is tied to interim final values. It provides an opportunity for stakeholders to provide new clinical information that was not available at the time of the RUC valuation that might affect work RVU values that are adopted in the interim final value process. If our proposal to modify the valuation process for new, revised and potentially misvalued codes is adopted, there would no longer be interim final values except for a very few codes that describe totally new services. Thus, we are proposing to eliminate the refinement panel process. By using the proposed process for new, revised, and potentially misvalued codes, we believe that the consideration of additional clinical information and any other issues associated with the CMS proposed values could be addressed through the notice and public comment process. Similarly, prior to CY 2012 when we consolidated the five-year valuation, changes made as part of the five-year review process were addressed in the proposed rule and those codes were generally not subject to the refinement process. The notice and comment process would provide stakeholders with complete information on the basis and rationale for our proposed inputs and any relating coding policies. We also note that an increasing number of requests for refinement do not include new clinical information that was not available at the time of the RUC meeting that would justify a change in the work RVUs, in accordance with the current requirements for refinement. Thus, we do not believe the elimination of the refinement panel process would negatively affect the code valuation process. We believe the proposed process, which includes a full notice and comment procedure before values are used for purposes of payment, offers stakeholders a better mechanism for providing any additional data for our consideration and discussing any concerns with our proposed values than the current refinement process., 342403=Based on our review of medical literature and examination of Medicare claims data, we believe that the typical number of specimens evaluated for prostate biopsies is between 10 and 12. Since G0416 is the code that currently is valued and used for between 10 and 12 specimens, we are proposing to use the existing values for G0416 for CY 2015., 853639=However, as CAHPS for PQRS was optional for group practices comprised of 25-99 eligible professionals in 2014 (78 FR 74485) and whereas we are proposing to require reporting of CAHPS for PQRS for group practices comprised of 100 or more eligible professionals, we propose that CAHPS for PQRS would be optional for groups of 25-99 and 2-24 eligible professionals. We note that all group practices that would be required to report or voluntarily elect to report CAHPS for PQRS would need to select and pay for a CMS-certified survey vendor to administer the CAHPS for PQRS survey on their behalf., 619875=These statutory provisions are self-implementing. Together, these statutory provisions require a 15-month extension of this rural bonus (which was previously established by the Secretary) through March 31, 2015, and do not require any substantive exercise of discretion on the part of the Secretary., 636148=Currently, section 1834(l)(12) of the Act (as amended by section 104(b) of the PAMA) specifies that, for services furnished during the period July 1, 2004 through March 31, 2015, the payment amount for the ground ambulance base rate is increased by a \u201cpercent increase\u201d (Super Rural Bonus) where the ambulance transport originates in a \u201cqualified rural area,\u201d which is a rural area that we determine to be in the lowest 25th percentile of all rural populations arrayed by population density (also known as a \u201csuper rural area\u201d). We implement this Super Rural Bonus in \u00a7 414.610(c)(5)(ii). Adoption of the revised OMB delineations and the updated RUCA codes would have no negative impact on ambulance transports in super rural areas, as none of the current super rural areas would lose their status due to the revised OMB delineations and the updated RUCA codes., 163691=In addition, section 220 of the PAMA included several provisions affecting the valuation process for services under the PFS. Section 220(a) of the PAMA amended section 1848(c)(2) of the Act to add a new subparagraph (M). The new subparagraph (M) provides that the Secretary may collect or obtain information from any eligible professional or any other source on the resources directly or indirectly related to furnishing services for which payment is made under the PFS, and that such information may be used in the determination of relative values for services under the PFS. Such information may include the time involved in furnishing services; the amounts, types and prices of practice expense inputs; overhead and accounting information for practices of physicians and other suppliers, and any other elements that would improve the valuation of services under the PFS. This information may be collected or obtained through surveys of physicians or other suppliers, providers of services, manufacturers and vendors; surgical logs, billing systems, or other practice or facility records; EHRs; and any other mechanism determined appropriate by the Secretary. If we use this information, we are required to disclose the source and use of the information in rulemaking, and to make available aggregated information that does not disclose individual eligible professionals, group practices, or information obtained pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement. Beginning with fiscal year 2014, the Secretary may compensate eligible professionals for submission of data., 586849=Similarly, we remind stakeholders that in the CY 2014 final rule, we established particular billing requirements for CCM services that require the practitioner to:, 772595=As noted above for group-level reporting, composite scores and benchmarks are critical in helping consumers best understand the quality measure information presented. For that reason, in addition to making all 2015 PQRS measures available for public reporting, we seek comment to create composites and publish composite scores by grouping measures based on the PQRS measure groups, if technically feasible. We will analyze the data collected in 2015 and conduct psychometric and statistical analyses to create composites for PQRS measure groups to be published in 2016, including:, 295189=In the CY 2013 final rule with comment period, we built upon the work we began in CY 2009 to review potentially misvalued codes that have not been reviewed since the implementation of the PFS (so-called \u201cHarvard-valued codes\u201d). In CY 2009, we requested recommendations from the RUC to aid in our review of Harvard-valued codes that had not yet been reviewed, focusing first on high-volume, low intensity codes (73 FR 38589). In the Fourth Five-Year Review, we requested recommendations from the RUC to aid in our review of Harvard-valued codes with annual utilization of greater than 30,000 (76 FR 32410). In the CY 2013 final rule with comment period, we identified Harvard-valued services with annual allowed charges that total at least $10,000,000 as potentially misvalued. In addition to the Harvard-valued codes, in the CY 2013 final rule with comment period we finalized for review a list of potentially misvalued codes that have stand-alone PE (codes with physician work and no listed work time and codes with no physician work and have listed work time)., 150582=Originally, the resource-based method was to be used beginning in 1998, but section 4505(a) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33, enacted on August 5, 1997) (BBA) delayed implementation of the resource-based PE RVU system until January 1, 1999. In addition, section 4505(b) of the BBA provided for a 4-year transition period from the charge-based PE RVUs to the resource-based PE RVUs., 874319=Additionally, we noted that, with respect to the following e-measure CMS140v2, Breast Cancer Hormonal Therapy for Stage IC-IIIC Estrogen Receptor/Progesterone Receptor (ER/PR) Positive Breast Cancer (NQF 0387), a substantive error was discovered in the June 2013 version of this electronically specified clinical quality measure. Therefore, the PQRS required the use of the prior, December 2012 version of this measure, which is CMS140v1 (78 FR 74489). Please note that, consistent with other EHR measures, since a more recent and corrected version of this measure has been developed, we will require the reporting of the most recent, updated versions of the measure Breast Cancer Hormonal Therapy for Stage IC-IIIC Estrogen Receptor/Progesterone Receptor (ER/PR) Positive Breast Cancer (NQF 0387)\u2014currently version CMS140v3\u2014for the year., 154880=Section 4505(f) of the BBA amended section 1848(c) of the Act to require that we implement resource-based MP RVUs for services furnished on or after CY 2000. The resource-based MP RVUs were implemented in the PFS final rule with comment period published November 2, 1999 (64 FR 59380). The MP RVUs are based on commercial and physician-owned insurers' malpractice insurance premium data from all the states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. For more information on MP RVUs, see section II.C. of this proposed rule., 624564=The current geographic areas used under the ambulance fee schedule are based on OMB standards published on December 27, 2000 (65 FR 82228 through 82238) and Census 2000 data and Census Bureau population estimates for 2007 and 2008 (OMB Bulletin No. 10-02). For a discussion of OMB's delineation of Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) and our implementation of the CBSA definitions under the ambulance fee schedule, we refer readers to the preamble of the CY 2007 Ambulance Fee Schedule proposed rule (71 FR 30358 through 30361) and the CY 2007 PFS final rule (71 FR 69712 through 69716). On February 28, 2013, OMB issued OMB Bulletin No. 13-01, which established revised delineations for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined Statistical Areas, and provided guidance on the use of the delineations of these statistical areas. A copy of this bulletin may be obtained at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b-13-01.pdf. According to OMB, \u201c[t]his bulletin provides the delineations of all Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Metropolitan Divisions, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, Combined Statistical Areas, and New England City and Town Areas in the United States and Puerto Rico based on the standards published on June 28, 2010, in the Federal Register (75 FR 37246-37252) and Census Bureau data.\u201d OMB defines an MSA as a CBSA associated with at least one urbanized area that has a population of at least 50,000, and a Micropolitan Statistical Area (referred to in this discussion as a Micropolitan Area) as a CBSA associated with at least one urban cluster that has a population of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 (75 FR 37252). Counties that do not qualify for inclusion in a CBSA are deemed \u201cOutside CBSAs.\u201d We note that, when referencing the new OMB geographic boundaries of statistical areas, we are using the term \u201cdelineations\u201d consistent with OMB's use of the term (75 FR 37249)., 578134=In one area\u2014that of electronic health records\u2014we are concerned that the existing elements of the CCM service could leave some gaps in assuring that beneficiaries consistently receive care management services that offer the benefits of advanced primary care as it was envisioned when this service was created. It is clear that effective care management can be accomplished only through regular monitoring of the patient's health status, needs, and services, and through frequent communication and exchange of information with the beneficiary and among health care practitioners treating the beneficiary. As a part of the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 43338 through 43339), we specified that the electronic health record for a patient receiving CCM services should include a full list of problems, medications and medication allergies in order to inform the care plan, care coordination, and ongoing clinical care. Furthermore, those furnishing CCM services must be able to facilitate communication of relevant patient information through electronic exchange of a summary care record with other health care providers as a part of managing health care transitions. We believe that if care is to be coordinated effectively, all communication must be timely, and it must include the information that each team member needs to know to furnish care that is congruent with a patient's needs and preferences. In addition, those furnishing CCM services need to establish reliable flows of information from emergency departments, hospitals, and providers of post-acute care services to track their CCM patients receiving care in those settings. Reliable information flow supports care transitions, and can be used to assess the need for modifications of the care plan that will reduce the risk of readmissions, increased morbidity, or mortality., 628354=Additionally, in the FY 2015 IPPS proposed rule (79 FR 28055), we also proposed to adopt OMB's revised delineations to identify urban areas and rural areas for purposes of the IPPS wage index. For the reasons discussed above, we believe it would be appropriate to adopt the same geographic area delineations for use under the ambulance fee schedule as are used under the IPPS and other Medicare payment systems. Thus, we are proposing to implement the new OMB delineations as described in the February 28, 2013 OMB Bulletin No. 13-01 beginning in CY 2015 to more accurately identify urban and rural areas for ambulance fee schedule payment purposes. We believe that the updated OMB delineations more realistically reflect rural and urban populations, and that the use of such delineations under the ambulance fee schedule would result in more accurate payment. Under the ambulance fee schedule, consistent with our current definitions of urban and rural areas (\u00a7 414.605), MSAs would continue to be recognized as urban areas, while Micropolitan and other areas outside MSAs, and rural census tracts within MSAs (as discussed below), would be recognized as rural areas., 469716=(a) Low volume service codes: As discussed previously in this section, service-specific MP RVUs are determined based on the weighted average risk factor(s) of the specialties that furnish the service. For rarely-billed Medicare services (that is, when CY 2013 claims data reflected allowed services of less than 100), we used only the risk factor of the dominant specialty as reflected in our claims data. Approximately 2,000 services met the criteria for \u201clow volume.\u201d The dominant specialty for each \u201clow volume\u201d service was also determined from CY 2013 Medicare claims data. We continue to believe that a balanced approach between including all of the specialties in our claims data and the application of the dominant specialty for each low volume service is the most appropriate approach to the development of malpractice RVUs., 703023=Section 405.400 sets forth certain definitions for purposes of the private contracting regulations. Among the defined terms is \u201cEmergency care services\u201d which means services furnished to an individual for treatment of an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 422.2. The cross-referenced regulation at \u00a7 422.2 included within the definition of emergency care services was deleted on June 29, 2000 (65 FR 40314) and at that time we inadvertently neglected to revise that cross-reference. The cross-reference within the definition of emergency care services should have been amended at that time to cite the definition of \u201cemergency services\u201d in \u00a7 424.101., 272576=In considering all the comments, however, we were persuaded that the comparison of OPPS (or ASC) payment amounts to PFS payment amounts for particular procedures is not the most appropriate or effective approach to ensuring that that PFS payment rates are based on accurate cost assumptions. Commenters noted several flaws with the approach. First, unlike PFS payments, OPPS and ASC payments for individual services are grouped into rates that reflect the costs of a range of services. Second, commenters suggested that since the ASC rates reflect the OPPS relative weights to determine payment rates under the ASC payment system, and are not based on cost information collected from ASCs, the ASC rates should not be used in the proposed policy. For these and other reasons raised by commenters, we are not proposing a similar policy for the CY 2015 PFS. If we consider using OPPS or ASC payment rates in developing PFS PE RVUs in future rulemaking, we would consider all of the comments received regarding the technical application of the previous proposal., 832696=Consistent with the group practice reporting requirements under section 1848(m)(3)(C) of the Act, we propose to modify \u00a7 414.90(j) to incorporate the following criterion for the satisfactory reporting of PQRS quality measures for group practices registered to participate in the GPRO for the 12-month reporting period for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment using the GPRO web interface for groups practices of 25-99 eligible professionals: The group practice would report on all measures included in the web interface; AND populate data fields for the first 248 consecutively ranked and assigned beneficiaries in the order in which they appear in the group's sample for each module or preventive care measure. If the pool of eligible assigned beneficiaries is less than 248, then the group practice would report on 100 percent of assigned beneficiaries. In other words, we understand that, in some instances, the sampling methodology CMS provides will not be able to assign at least 248 patients on which a group practice may report, particularly those group practices on the smaller end of the range of 25-99 eligible professionals. If the group practice is assigned less than 248 Medicare beneficiaries, then the group practice would report on 100 percent of its assigned beneficiaries. A group practice would be required to report on at least 1 measure for which there is Medicare patient data., 500084=Under our existing policy, we add services to the telehealth list on a category 1 basis when we determine that they are similar to services on the existing telehealth list with respect to the roles of, and interactions among, the beneficiary, physician (or other practitioner) at the distant site and, if necessary, the telepresenter. As we stated in the CY 2012 proposed rule (76 FR 42826), we believe that the category 1 criteria not only streamline our review process for publically requested services that fall into this category, the criteria also expedite our ability to identify codes for the telehealth list that resemble those services already on this list., 334724=Our data confirms that the overwhelming majority of all mammography is digital. As a result, we are proposing that the CPT codes 77055, 77056 and 77057 be used for reporting mammography to Medicare regardless of whether film or digital technology is used, and to delete the HCPCS G-codes G0202, G0204, and G0206. We are proposing, for CY 2015, to value the CPT codes using the values established for the digital mammography G-codes since digital technology is now the typical service. (See section II.A. of this proposed rule for more discussion of this proposal.) In addition, since the G-codes values that we propose to use for the CPT codes for CY 2015 have not been reviewed since they were created in CY 2002, we are proposing to include CPT codes 77055, 77056, and 77057 on the list of potentially misvalued codes., 145254=The Act requires that annual adjustments to PFS RVUs not cause annual estimated expenditures to differ by more than $20 million from what they would have been had the adjustments not been made. If adjustments to RVUs would cause expenditures to change by more than $20 million, we must make adjustments to preserve budget neutrality. These adjustments can affect the distribution of Medicare expenditures across specialties. In addition, several proposed changes would affect the specialty distribution of Medicare expenditures. When considering the combined impact of work, PE, and MP RVU changes, the projected payment impacts are small for most specialties; however, the impact would be larger for a few specialties. The most significant impacts are for radiation therapy centers and radiation oncology for which there would be decreases of 8 and 4 percent, respectively. These reductions primarily stem from a proposal discussed in section II.A. to consider an equipment item as indirect rather than direct practice expense. Payment for chronic care management (CCM) services is projected to have a positive effect on family practice, internal medicine, and geriatrics. This proposed rule includes new proposed MP RVUs based upon CY 2015 five-year review of MP RVUs. For most specialties, the proposed revisions for the five-year review of MP RVUs would result in minor overall changes in RVUs, with only ophthalmology (-2 percent) having a projected change of at least 2 percent., 298475=In the CY 2011 PFS proposed rule (75 FR 40068) and CY 2012 PFS proposed rule (76 FR 42790), we solicited public comments on possible approaches, methodologies, and data sources that we should consider for a validation process. A summary of the comments along with our responses are included in the CY 2011 PFS final rule with comment period (75 FR 73217) and the CY 2012 PFS final rule with comment period (73054 through 73055)., 771337=Second, we propose to make all individual EP-level PQRS measures collected via registry, EHR, or claims available for public reporting on Physician Compare for data collected in 2015 to be publicly reported in late CY 2016, if technically feasible. [8] This will provide the opportunity for more EPs to have measures included on Physician Compare, and it will provide more information to consumers to make informed decisions about their health care. As with group-level measures, we propose to publicly report all measures submitted and reviewed and deemed valid and reliable in the Physician Compare downloadable file. However, not all of these measures necessarily would be included on the Physician Compare profile pages. Our analysis of the measure data once collected, consumer testing, and stakeholder feedback would determine specifically which measures are published on profile pages on the Web site. In this way, quality information at the individual practitioner level would be available, as has been regularly requested by Medicare consumers, but consumers will not be overwhelmed with too much information on each EPs profile page., 820125=To be consistent with the criterion we finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive, as well as to continue to align with the final criterion for meeting the clinical quality measure (CQM) component of achieving meaningful use under the Medicare EHR Incentive Program, we are proposing to modify \u00a7 414.90(j) and propose the following criterion for the satisfactory reporting for individual eligible professionals to report individual measures via a direct EHR that is CEHRT or an EHR data submission vendor that is CEHRT for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment: The eligible professional would report 9 measures covering at least 3 of the NQS domains. If an eligible professional's CEHRT does not contain patient data for at least 9 measures covering at least 3 domains, then the eligible professional would be required to report all of the measures for which there is Medicare patient data. An eligible professional would be required to report on at least 1 measure for which there is Medicare patient data., 1009859=The second aligned option finalized in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74755 through 74756) is a group reporting option for CQMs for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program beginning in CY 2014 under which EPs who are part of a Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) initiative practice site that successfully reports at least nine electronically specified CQMs across three domains for the relevant reporting period in accordance with the requirements established for the CPC initiative and using CEHRT would satisfy the CQM reporting component of meaningful use for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. If a CPC practice site is not successful in reporting, EPs who are part of the site would still have the opportunity to report CQMs in accordance with the requirements established for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program in the Stage 2 final rule. Additionally, only those EPs who are beyond their first year of demonstrating meaningful use may use this CPC group reporting option. The CPC practice sites must submit the CQM data in the form and manner required by the CPC initiative. Therefore, whether CPC required electronic submission or attestation of CQMs, the CPC practice site must submit the CQM data in the form and manner required by the CPC initiative., 785025=In addition, in the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period, we introduced the reporting of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ's) Clinician & Group (CG) Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey measures, referenced at https://cahps.ahrq.gov/Surveys-Guidance/CG/index.html. AHRQ's CAHPS Clinician & Group Survey Version 2.0 (CG-CAHPS) includes 34 core CG-CAHPS survey questions. In addition to these 34 core questions, the CAHPS survey measures that are used in the PQRS include supplemental questions from CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home Survey, Core CAHPS Health Plan Survey Version 5.0, other CAHPS supplemental items, and some additional questions. Since the CAHPS survey used in the PQRS covers more than just the 34 core CG-CAHPS survey measures, we will refer to the CG-CAHPS survey measures used in the PQRS as \u201cCAHPS for PQRS.\u201d We propose to make this revision throughout \u00a7 414.90., 800688=In the CY 2014 PFS proposed rule, we proposed that, to be considered a QCDR, an entity would be required to demonstrate that it has a plan to publicly report its quality data through a mechanism where the public and registry participants can view data about individual eligible professionals, as well as view regional and national benchmarks (78 FR 43363). Due to stakeholder feedback against this proposal, as well as comments requesting more details surrounding this proposal, we did not finalize this proposed requirement in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period. However, we noted that we would revisit this proposal in future years (78 FR 74471). Because of our ongoing interest in providing transparency to the public for quality measures data that is reported under the PQRS, we again propose the requirement that an entity make available to the public the quality measures data for which its eligible professionals report. To clarify this proposal, we propose that, at a minimum, the QCDR publicly report the following quality measures data information that we believe will give patients adequate information on the care provided by an eligible professional:, 336476=In the CY 2014 proposed rule, based on a RUC recommendation, we proposed to replace the ultrasound room included as a direct PE input for CPT code 76775 with a portable ultrasound unit. Since all the RVUs (including the PE RVUs) for G0389 were crosswalked from CPT code 76775, the proposed PE RVUs for G0389 in the CY 2014 proposed rule were reduced significantly as a result of this change to the direct PE inputs for 76775. However, we did not discuss the applicability of this change to G0389 in the proposed rule's preamble and did not receive any comments on G0389 in response to the proposed rule. We finalized the change to CPT code 76775 in the CY 2014 final rule with comment period and the corresponding PE RVUs for G0389 were also reduced., 119959=Chava Sheffield, (410) 786-2298, for issues related to practice expense methodology, impacts, the sustainable growth rate, conscious sedation, or conversion factors., 518055=Under the process finalized in the CY 2012 PFS final rule with comment period, in each year's proposed rule, we propose specific codes and/or groups of codes that we believe may be appropriate to consider under our potentially misvalued code initiative. As part of our process for developing the list of proposed potentially misvalued codes, we consider public nominations for potentially misvalued codes under a process also established in the CY 2012 PFS final rule with comment period. If appropriate, we include such codes in our proposed potentially misvalued code list. In the proposed rule, we solicit comments on the proposed potentially misvalued codes. We then respond to comments and establish a final list of potentially misvalued codes in the final rule for that year. These potentially misvalued codes are reviewed and revalued, if appropriate, in subsequent years. In addition, the RUC regularly identifies potentially misvalued codes using screens that have previously been identified by CMS, such as codes performed together more than 75 percent of the time., 308781=To develop the CY 2015 proposed list in this category, we began by identifying the top 20 codes by specialty in terms of allowed charges. For this analysis, we used the same specialties as used for the impact analysis in section VI. of this proposed rule. We excluded codes from our proposed potentially misvalued list that we have reviewed since CY 2009, with fewer than $10 million in allowed charges, and that describe anesthesia or E/M services. We excluded E/M services from the list of proposed potentially misvalued codes for the same reasons that we excluded them in the CY 2012 analysis, which we explained in the CY 2012 final rule with comment period (76 FR 73062 through 73065)., 458264=For the CY 2015 MP RVU update, we examined the possibility of classifying injection procedures used in conjunction with cardiac catheterization as surgery (for purposes of assigning service specific risk factors). After careful consideration, we believe that injection procedures, when furnished in conjunction with cardiac catheterization, are more akin to the malpractice risk of surgical procedures than most non-surgical services. Therefore we applied the surgical risk factor to injection procedures used in conjunction with cardiac catheterization. Table 15 shows the invasive cardiology services and injection services furnished in conjunction with cardiac catheterization to be considered as surgery for purposes of assigning specialty-specific risk factors., 731683=Section 10331(a)(1) of the Affordable Care Act, required that, by no later than January 1, 2011, we develop a Physician Compare Internet Web site with information on physicians enrolled in the Medicare program under section 1866(j) of the Act, as well as information on other eligible professionals (EPs) who participate in the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) under section 1848 of the Act., 584099=To assist stakeholders in commenting, we remind you of the elements of the current scope of service for CCM services that are required in order for a practitioner to bill Medicare for CCM services as finalized in the CY 2014 final rule with comment period. We would note that additional explanation of these elements can be found at 78 FR 74414 through 74428. The CCM service includes:, 318554=For CY 2014, we established interim final values for four epidural injection procedures, CPT codes 62310 (Injection(s), of diagnostic or therapeutic substance(s) (including anesthetic, antispasmodic, opioid, steroid, other solution), not including neurolytic substances, including needle or catheter placement, includes contrast for localization when performed, epidural or subarachnoid; cervical or thoracic), 62311 (Injection(s), of diagnostic or therapeutic substance(s) (including anesthetic, antispasmodic, opioid, steroid, other solution), not including neurolytic substances, including needle or catheter placement, includes contrast for localization when performed, epidural or subarachnoid; lumbar or sacral (caudal)), 62318 (Injection(s), including indwelling catheter placement, continuous infusion or intermittent bolus, of diagnostic or therapeutic substance(s) (including anesthetic, antispasmodic, opioid, steroid, other solution), not including neurolytic substances, includes contrast for localization when performed, epidural or subarachnoid; cervical or thoracic) and 62319 (Injection(s), including indwelling catheter placement, continuous infusion or intermittent bolus, of diagnostic or therapeutic substance(s) (including anesthetic, antispasmodic, opioid, steroid, other solution), not including neurolytic substances, includes contrast for localization when performed, epidural or subarachnoid; lumbar or sacral (caudal)). These interim final values resulted in CY 2014 payment reductions from the CY 2013 rates for all four procedures., 270314=Accurate and reliable pricing information for both individual items and indirect PEs is critical to establish accurate PE RVUs for PFS services. As we have addressed in previous rulemaking, we have serious concerns regarding the accuracy of some of the information we use in developing PE RVUs. In particular, we have several longstanding concerns regarding the accuracy of direct PE inputs, including both items and procedure time assumptions, and prices of individual supplies and equipment (78 FR 74248-74250). In addition to the concerns regarding the inputs used in valuing particular procedures, we also note that the allocation of indirect PE is based on information collected several years ago (as described above) and will likely need to be updated in the coming years. To mitigate the impact of some of these potentially problematic data used in developing values for individual services, in CY 2014 rulemaking we proposed to limit the nonfacility PE RVUs for individual codes so that the total nonfacility PFS payment amount would not exceed the total combined amount that Medicare would pay for the same code in the facility setting. In developing the proposal, we sought a reliable means for Medicare to set upper payment limits for office-based procedures and believed OPPS and ASC payment rates would provide an appropriate comparison because these rates are based on relatively more reliable cost information in settings with cost structures that generally would be expected to be higher than in the office setting., 176123=When we began using the PPIS data in CY 2010, we did not change the PE RVU methodology itself or the manner in which the PE/HR data are used in that methodology. We only updated the PE/HR data based on the new survey. Furthermore, as we explained in the CY 2010 PFS final rule with comment period (74 FR 61751), because of the magnitude of payment reductions for some specialties resulting from the use of the PPIS data, we transitioned its use over a 4-year period from the previous PE RVUs to the PE RVUs developed using the new PPIS data. As provided in the CY 2010 PFS final rule with comment period (74 FR 61751), the transition to the PPIS data was complete for CY 2013. Therefore, PE RVUs from CY 2013 forward are developed based entirely on the PPIS data, except as noted in this section., 441514=We note that for determining the risk factor for suppliers of TC-only services, we were not able to obtain more recent premium data than what was used for the CY 2010 update. Therefore, we updated the premium data for IDTFs that we used in the CY 2010 update. These data were obtained from a survey conducted by the Radiology Business Management Association (RBMA) in 2009. We updated the RBMA survey data by the change in non-surgical premiums for all specialty types since the previous MP RVU update and calculated an updated TC specialty risk factor. We applied the updated TC specialty risk factor to suppliers of TC-only services. Table 14 shows the risk factors by specialty type., 840792=Consistent with the criterion finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive and the group practice reporting requirements under section 1848(m)(3)(C) of the Act, for those group practices that choose to report using a qualified registry, we propose here to modify \u00a7 414.90(j) to include the following satisfactory reporting criterion via qualified registry for ALL group practices who select to participate in the GPRO for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment: The group practice would report at least 9 measures, covering at least 3 of the NQS domains. Of these measures, if a group practice sees at least 1 Medicare patient in a face-to-face encounter, the group practice would report on at least 2 measures in the cross-cutting measure set specified in Table 21. If less than 9 measures covering at least 3 NQS domains apply to the eligible professional, the group practice would report up to 8 measures covering 1-3 NQS domains for which there is Medicare patient data, AND report each measure for at least 50 percent of the eligible professional's Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies. Measures with a 0 percent performance rate would not be counted., 143078=The Social Security Act (the Act) requires us to establish payments under the PFS based on national uniform relative value units (RVUs) that account for the relative resources used in furnishing a service. The Act requires that RVUs be established for three categories of resources: work, practice expense (PE); and malpractice (MP) expense; and, that we establish by regulation each year's payment amounts for all physicians' services, incorporating geographic adjustments to reflect the variations in the costs of furnishing services in different geographic areas. In this major proposed rule, we propose RVUs for CY 2015 for the PFS, and other Medicare Part B payment policies, to ensure that our payment systems are updated to reflect changes in medical practice and the relative value of services, as well as changes in the statute. In addition, this proposed rule includes discussions and proposals regarding:, 131153=CPT[Physicians] Current Procedural Terminology (CPT codes, descriptions and other data only are copyright 2013 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.), 788186=As we explain in further detail in this section III.K, we are proposing that\u2014in addition to proposing to require that an eligible professional or group practice report on at least 9 measures covering 3 NQS domains\u2014an eligible professional or group practice who sees at least 1 Medicare patient in a face-to-face encounter, as we propose to define that term in section III.K.2.a., and wishes to meet the proposed criterion for satisfactory reporting of PQRS quality measures via a qualified registry for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment would be required to report on at least 2 cross-cutting PQRS measures specified in Table 21. In accordance with this proposal, we are proposing to require that, in addition to being required to be able to collect all needed data elements and transmit to CMS the data at the TIN/NPI level for at least 9 measures covering at least 3 of the NQS domains for which a qualified registry transmits data, a qualified registry would be required to be able to collect all needed data elements and transmit to CMS the data at the TIN/NPI level for ALL cross-cutting measures specified in Table 21 for which the registry's participating eligible professionals are able to report. We are proposing to require that qualified registries be able to report on all cross-cutting measures specified in Table 21 for which the registry's participating eligible professionals are able to report, rather than proposing to require a minimum of 2, so that eligible professionals and group practices using qualified registries to report PQRS measures would have the flexibility in choosing which cross-cutting measures to report, and to report on as many cross-cutting measures specified in Table 21 as they are able., 332062=With regard to the request for refinement, we are denying this request as the comments do not demonstrate that the requirements for refinement were met. Moreover, since we are proposing different values for these codes for CY 2015 (using CY 2013 inputs) there would be no purpose for refinement as the public comment period for this proposed rule will provide the opportunity for the public to share any relevant information on our proposed values., 345801=Using the same logic, we are proposing to use the direct PE inputs for GXXX2 and GXXX3 currently included for G0447, prorated to account for the differences in time and number of beneficiaries described by the new codes. The proposed direct PE inputs for these codes are included in the CY 2015 proposed direct PE input database, available on the CMS Web site under the downloads for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/. We are also proposing to crosswalk the malpractice risk factor from HCPCS code G0447 to both HCPCS codes GXXX2 and GXXX3, as we believe the same specialty mix will furnish these services. We request public comment on these proposed values for HCPCS codes GXXX2 and GXXX3., 416543=We note that in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we established values for many upper gastrointestinal procedures, 58 of which were included in Appendix G. For those interim final values, we included the inputs related to moderate sedation. In the CY 2015 PFS final rule with comment period, we will address these interim final values, and we anticipate establishing CY 2015 inputs for the lower gastrointestinal procedures, many of which are also listed in Appendix G. It is our expectation that we will not change existing policies for valuing moderate sedation as inherent in these procedures until we have the opportunity to assess and respond to the comments on this proposed rule on the overall valuation of Appendix G codes., 1014734=Section 1899(b)(3)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary to determine appropriate measures to assess the quality of care furnished by ACOs, such as measures of clinical processes and outcomes; patient, and, wherever practicable, caregiver experience of care; and utilization such as rates of hospital admission for ambulatory sensitive conditions. Section 1899(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires ACOs to submit data in a form and manner specified by the Secretary on measures that the Secretary determines necessary for ACOs to report to evaluate the quality of care furnished by ACOs. Section 1899(b)(3)(C) of the Act requires the Secretary to establish quality performance standards to assess the quality of care furnished by ACOs, and to seek to improve the quality of care furnished by ACOs over time by specifying higher standards, new measures, or both for the purposes of assessing the quality of care. Additionally, section 1899(b)(3)(D) of the Act gives the Secretary authority to incorporate reporting requirements and incentive payments related to the PQRS, EHR Incentive Program and other similar initiatives under section 1848 of the Act. Finally, section 1899(d)(1)(A) of the Act states that an ACO is eligible to receive payment for shared savings, if they are generated, only after meeting the quality performance standards established by the Secretary., 814245=We note that, unlike the criterion we finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive, we are proposing to require an eligible professional who sees at least 1 Medicare patient in a face-to-face encounter, as we propose to define that term below, during the 12-month 2017 PQRS payment adjustment reporting period to report at least 2 measures contained in the proposed cross-cutting measure set specified in Table 21. As we noted in the CY 2014 PFS proposed rule (78 FR 43359), we are dedicated to collecting data that provides us with a better picture of the overall quality of care furnished by eligible professionals, particularly for the purpose of having PQRS reporting being used to assess quality performance under the VM. We believe that requiring an eligible professional to report on at least 2 broadly applicable, cross-cutting measures will provide us with quality data on more varied aspects of an eligible professional's practice. We also note that in its 2014 pre-rulemaking final report (available at http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2014/01/MAP_Pre-Rulemaking_Report__2014_Recommendations_on_Measures_for_More_than_20_Federal_Programs.aspx), the Measure Applications Partnership (MAP) encouraged the development of a core measure set (see page 16 of the \u201cMAP Pre-Rulemaking Report: 2014 Recommendations on Measures for More than 20 Federal Programs\u201d). The MAP stated \u201ca core [measure set] would address critical improvement gaps, align payment incentives across clinician types, and reduce reporting burden.\u201d, 554856=As we discussed in the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period, we are committed to supporting primary care and we have increasingly recognized care management as one of the critical components of primary care that contributes to better health for individuals and reduced expenditure growth (77 FR 68978). Accordingly, we have prioritized the development and implementation of a series of initiatives designed to improve payment for, and encourage long-term investment in, care management services. These initiatives include the following programs and demonstrations:, 867594=Please note that the PQRS quality measure specifications for any given proposed PQRS individual quality measure may differ from specifications for the same quality measure used in prior years. For example, for the proposed PQRS quality measures that were selected for reporting in 2014 and beyond, please note that detailed measure specifications, including the measure's title, for the proposed individual PQRS quality measures for 2013 and beyond may have been updated or modified during the NQF endorsement process or for other reasons., 847726=Consistent with the proposed group practice reporting option solely using a qualified registry for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, we understand that there may be instances where a group practice may not have at least 6 measures applicable to a group practice's practice. In this instance, a group practice reporting on less than 6 measures would still be able to meet the satisfactory reporting criterion via registry if the group practice reports on as many measures as are applicable to the group practice's practice. If a group practice reports on less than 6 individual measures using the qualified registry reporting mechanism in conjunction with a CMS-certified survey vendor to report CAHPS for PQRS, the group practice would be subject to a measure application validity process (MAV), which would allow us to determine whether a group practice should have reported quality data codes for additional measures and/or measures covering additional NQS domains., 302128=In the CY 2012 PFS final rule with comment period, we finalized a process for the public to nominate potentially misvalued codes (76 FR 73058). The public and stakeholders may nominate potentially misvalued codes for review by submitting the code with supporting documentation during the 60-day public comment period following the release of the annual PFS final rule with comment period. Supporting documentation for codes nominated for the annual review of potentially misvalued codes may include the following:, 749062=We continued to expand our plan for public reporting data on Physician Compare in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74449). In that final rule we finalized a decision that all measures collected through the GPRO web interface for groups of two or more EPs participating in 2014 under the PQRS GPRO and for ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program are available for public reporting in CY 2015. As with all measures we finalized with regard to Physician Compare, these data would include measure performance rates for measures reported that meet the minimum sample size of 20 patients and prove to be statistically valid and reliable. We also finalized a 30-day preview period prior to publication of quality data on Physician Compare. This will allow group practices to view their data as it will appear on Physician Compare before it is publicly reported. We decided that we will detail the process for the 30-day preview and provide a detailed timeline and instructions for preview in advance of the start of the preview period. ACOs will be able to view their quality data that will be publicly reported on Physician Compare through the ACO Quality Reports, which will be made available to ACOs for review at least 30 days prior to the start of public reporting on Physician Compare., 784052=We note that eligible professionals in critical access hospitals (CAHs) were previously not able to participate in the PQRS. Due to a change we made in the manner in which eligible professionals in CAHs are reimbursed by Medicare, it is now feasible for eligible professionals in CAHs to participate in the PQRS. Although eligible professionals in CAHs are not able to use the claims-based reporting mechanism to report PQRS quality measures data in 2014, beginning in 2015, these eligible professionals in CAHs may participate in the PQRS using ALL reporting mechanisms available, including the claims-based reporting mechanism. Finally, please note that in accordance with section 1848(a)(8) of the Act, all eligible professionals who do not meet the criteria for satisfactory reporting or satisfactory participation for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment will be subject to the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment with no exceptions., 851060=Proposed Option 3: Alternatively, if a group practice chooses to use the GPRO web interface in conjunction with reporting the CAHPS for PQRS survey measures, we propose the following criterion for satisfactory reporting for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment: For the 12-month reporting period for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, the group practice would report all CAHPS for PQRS survey measures via a certified vendor. In addition, the group practice would report on all measures included in the GPRO web interface; AND populate data fields for the first 248 consecutively ranked and assigned beneficiaries in the order in which they appear in the group's sample for each module or preventive care measure. If the pool of eligible assigned beneficiaries is less than 248, then the group practice would report on 100 percent of assigned beneficiaries. A group practice would be required to report on at least 1 measure for which there is Medicare patient data., 494907=As noted previously, in the December 31, 2002 Federal Register (67 FR 79988), we established a process for adding services to or deleting services from the list of Medicare telehealth services. This process provides the public with an ongoing opportunity to submit requests for adding services. We assign any qualifying request to make additions to the list of telehealth services to one of two categories. In the November 28, 2011 Federal Register (76 FR 73102), we finalized revisions to criteria that we use to review requests in the second category. The two categories are:, 993937=As we are proposing that for an eligible professional to meet the criterion for satisfactory participation in a QCDR for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, the eligible professional must report on at least 3 outcome measures or, in lieu of 3 outcome measures, at least 2 outcome measures and 1 resource use, patient experience of care, or efficiency/appropriate use measure, we are modifying this requirement to conform to this proposed satisfactory participation criterion. Therefore, we are proposing that a QCDR must have at least 3 outcome measures available for reporting, which is a measure that assesses the results of health care that are experienced by patients (that is, patients' clinical events; patients' recovery and health status; patients' experiences in the health system; and efficiency/cost). In lieu of having 3 outcome measures available for reporting, the QCDR must have at least 2 outcome measures available for reporting and at least 1 resource use, patient experience of care, or efficiency/appropriate use measure., 568313=Therefore, in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we created an exception to the generally applicable requirement that \u201cincident to\u201d services must be furnished under direct supervision. Specifically, we finalized a policy to require only general, rather than direct, supervision when CCM services are furnished incident to a practitioner's services outside of the practice's normal business hours by clinical staff who are direct employees of the practitioner or practice. We explained that, given the potential risk to patients that the exception to direct supervision could create, we believed that it was appropriate to design the exception as narrowly as possible (78 FR 74426). The direct employment requirement was intended to balance the less stringent general supervision requirement by ensuring that there is a direct oversight relationship between the supervising practitioner and the clinical staff personnel who provide after hours services., 875336=In accordance with our proposed criteria for the satisfactory reporting of PQRS measures for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment via claims and registry that requires an eligible professional or group practice to report on at least 2 cross-cutting measures, we are proposing the following 18 cross-cutting measure set specified in Table 21 for 2015 and beyond. Please note that our rationale for proposing each of these measures is found below the measure description. We have also indicated the PQRS reporting mechanism or mechanisms through which each proposed measure could be submitted. In addition to seeking comment on this proposed cross-cutting measure set specified in Table 21, we seek comment on other measures that commenters believe should be included in this proposed cross-cutting measure set for 2015 and beyond., 545186=For new, revised, and potentially misvalued codes for which we do not receive RUC recommendations before January 15th of a year, we propose to adopt coding policies and payment rates that conform, to the extent possible, to the policies and rates in place for the previous year. We would adopt these conforming policies on an interim basis pending our consideration of the RUC recommendations and the completion of notice and comment rulemaking to establish values for the codes. For codes for which there is no change in the CPT code, it is a simple matter to continue the current valuation. For services for which there are CPT coding changes, it is more complicated to maintain the current payment rates until the codes can be valued through the notice and comment rulemaking process. Since the changes in CPT codes are effective on January 1st of a year, and we would not have established values for the new or revised codes (or other codes within the code family), it would not be practicable for Medicare to use those CPT codes. For codes that were revised or deleted as part of the annual CPT coding changes, when the changes could affect the value of a code and we have not had an opportunity to consider the relevant RUC recommendations prior to the proposed rule, we propose to create G-codes to describe the predecessor codes to these codes. If CPT codes are revised in a manner that would not affect the resource inputs used to value the service, (for example, a grammatical changes to CPT code descriptors,) we could use these revised codes and continue to pay at the rate developed through the use of the same resource inputs. For example, if a single CPT code was separated into two codes and we did not receive RUC recommendations for the two codes before January 15th of the year, we would assign each of those new codes an \u201cI\u201d status indicator (which denotes that the codes are \u201cnot valid for Medicare purposes\u201d), and those codes could not be used for Medicare payment during the year. Instead we would create a G-code with the same description as the single predecessor CPT code and continue to use the same inputs as the predecessor CPT code for that G-code during the year., 835264=To maintain consistency in this reporting criteria, we note that this proposed criteria is similar to the criterion we finalized for the satisfactory reporting of PQRS quality measures for group practices selected to participate in the GPRO for the 12-month reporting periods for the 2013 and 2014 PQRS incentives for group practices of 100 or more eligible professionals in the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period (see Table 49 at 78 FR 74486). However, we are proposing to reduce the patient sample size a group practice is required to report quality measures data from 411 to 248. We examined the sample size of this reporting criterion and determined that the sample size we are proposing reduces provider reporting burden while still allowing for statistically valid and reliable performance results. For the 25-99 sized groups reporting via the web interface, we recognize the proposal to move from reporting 218 to 248 patients per sample represents a slight increase in reporting. However, based on experience with the 218 count and subsequent statistical analysis, we believe that there are increased performance reliabilities and validities gained when changing the minimum reporting requirement to 248. We believe statistical reliability and validity is extremely important when measuring provider performance, particularly given the implications of the Physician VM and Physician Compare public reporting, discussed in section III.N and section III.J respectively. Therefore, we believe this proposed criterion improves on the criterion previously finalized., 342791=In addition, we are proposing G0416 as a potentially misvalued code for CY 2015. We seek public comment on the appropriate work RVUs, work time, and direct PE inputs., 156253=In the CY 2012 PFS final rule with comment period (76 FR 73057), we finalized a proposal to consolidate reviews of work and PE RVUs under section 1848(c)(2)(B) of the Act and reviews of potentially misvalued codes under section 1848(c)(2)(K) of the Act into one annual process., 137193=PAMAProtecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-93), 521838=As we discussed in the CY 2012 PFS final rule with comment period, we adopted this consolidated review process to combine all coding revaluations into one annual process allowing for appropriate consideration of relativity in and across code families. In addition, this process assures that we have the benefit of the RUC recommendations for all codes being valued., 174014=We determine the direct PE for a specific service by adding the costs of the direct resources (that is, the clinical staff, medical supplies, and medical equipment) typically involved with furnishing that service. The costs of the resources are calculated using the refined direct PE inputs assigned to each CPT code in our PE database, which are generally based on our review of recommendations received from the RUC and those provided in response to public comment periods. For a detailed explanation of the direct PE methodology, including examples, we refer readers to the Five-Year Review of Work Relative Value Units under the PFS and Proposed Changes to the Practice Expense Methodology proposed notice (71 FR 37242) and the CY 2007 PFS final rule with comment period (71 FR 69629)., 852089=Furthermore, as was required for reporting periods occurring in 2014 (78 FR 74485), we propose that all group practices comprised of 100 or more eligible professionals that register to participate in the PQRS GPRO, regardless of the reporting mechanism the group practice chooses, would be required to select a CMS-certified survey vendor to administer the CAHPS for PQRS survey on their behalf. As such, for purposes of meeting the criteria for satisfactory reporting for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, a group practice participating in the PQRS GPRO would be required to use 1 of these 3 proposed reporting options mentioned above. We note that, for reporting periods occurring in 2014, we stated that we would administer and fund the collection of (CG-CAHPS) data for these groups (of 100 or more eligible professionals using the GPRO web interface that are required to report on CAHPS for PQRS survey measures) (78 FR 74452). We stated that we would bear the cost of administering the CAHPS for PQRS survey measures, as we were requiring the group practices to report on CAHPS for PQRS survey measures. Unfortunately, beginning in 2015, it will no longer be feasible for CMS to continue to bear the cost of group practices of 100 or more eligible professionals to report the CAHPS for PQRS survey measures. Therefore, the group practice would be required to bear the cost of administering the CAHPS for PQRS survey measures., 731329=Data collection requirements would begin January 1, 2015 according to this proposed rule for applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations., 878637=Table 22 contains the additional measures we are proposing to include in the PQRS measure set for CY 2015 and beyond. Please note that not all of the proposed cross-cutting measures may appear in Table 22, as some of the propose cross-cutting measures specified in Table 21 were finalized in the CY 2013 or CY 2014 PFS final rules with comment period. Please note that our rationale for proposing each of these measures is found below the measure description. We have also indicated the PQRS reporting mechanism or mechanisms through which each proposed measure could be submitted., 179255=For registered dietician services, the resource-based PE RVUs have been calculated in accordance with the final policy that crosswalks the specialty to the \u201cAll Physicians\u201d PE/HR data, as adopted in the CY 2010 PFS final rule with comment period (74 FR 61752) and discussed in more detail in the CY 2011 PFS final rule with comment period (75 FR 73183)., 261775=We also received a RUC recommendation to update the prices associated with two supply items. Specifically, the RUC recommended that we increase the price of SA042 (pack, cleaning and disinfecting, endoscope) from $15.52 to $17.06 to reflect the addition of supply item SJ009 (basin, irrigation) to the pack, and increase the price of SA019 (kit, IV starter) from $1.37 to $1.60 to reflect the addition of supply item SA044 (underpad 2 ft. x 3 ft. (Chux)) to the kit. We are proposing to update the prices for both of these items based on these recommendations. The CY 2015 direct PE database reflects these proposed changes and is available on the CMS Web site under the supporting data files for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/., 266717=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74245), we summarized comments received about whether CPT codes 77372 and 77373 would accurately reflect the resources used in furnishing the typical SRS delivery if there were no coding distinction between robotic and non-robotic delivery methods. Until now, SRS services furnished using robotic methods were billed using contractor-priced G-codes G0339 (Image-guided robotic linear accelerator based stereotactic radiosurgery, complete course of therapy in one session or first session of fractionated treatment), and G0340 (Image-guided robotic linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery, delivery including collimator changes and custom plugging, fractionated treatment, all lesions, per session, second through fifth sessions, maximum five sessions per course of treatment). We indicated that we would consider these codes in future rulemaking., 136688=OBRA '90Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101- 508), 854722=We believe these patient surveys are important tools for assessing beneficiary experience of care and outcomes and, moving forward, we would like to emphasize the importance of collecting patient experience of care data through the use of CAHPS for PQRS. Therefore, based on our authority under section 1848(m)(3)(C) of the Act to determine the criteria for satisfactory reporting for group practices under section 1848(m)(3)(C) of the Act, we are proposing to require that, in conjunction with other satisfactory reporting criteria we establish in future years, beginning with the 12-month reporting period for the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment, and for subsequent years, group practices comprised of 25 or more eligible professionals that are participating in the GPRO report and pay for the collection of the CAHPS for PQRS survey measures. We understand that the cost of administering the CAHPS for PQRS survey may be significant, so we are proposing this requirement well in advance of the year in which it would be first effective in order to provide group practices with early notice so that their practices may adjust accordingly., 141947=Throughout this proposed rule, we use CPT codes and descriptions to refer to a variety of services. We note that CPT codes and descriptions are copyright 2013 American Medical Association. All Rights Reserved. CPT is a registered trademark of the American Medical Association (AMA). Applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) apply., 791839=In the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period, we finalized requirements that although EHR vendors and their products would no longer be required to undergo the previously existing qualification process, we would only accept the data if the data are: (1) Transmitted in a CMS-approved XML format utilizing a Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standard such as Quality Reporting Data Architecture (QRDA) level 1 (and for EHR data submission vendor products that intend to report for purposes of the proposed PQRS-Medicare EHR Incentive Program Pilot, if the aggregate data are transmitted in a CMS-approved XML format); and (2) in compliance with a CMS-specified secure method for data submission (77 FR 69183 through 69187). To further clarify, EHR vendors and their products must be able to submit data in the form and manner specified by CMS. Accordingly, direct EHRs and EHR data submission vendors must comply with CMS Implementation Guides for both the QRDA-I and QRDA-III data file formats. The Implementation Guides for 2014 are available at http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/Guide_QRDA_2014eCQM.pdf. Updated guides for 2015, when available, will be posted on the CMS EHR Incentive Program Web site at http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms. These implementation guides further describe the technical requirements for data submission to ensure the data elements required for measure calculation and verification are provided. We propose to continue applying these requirements to direct EHR products and EHR data submission vendor products for 2015 and beyond. For 2015 and beyond, we also propose to have the eligible professional or group practice provide the CMS EHR Certification Number of the product used by the eligible professional or group practice for direct EHRs and EHR data submission vendors., 668498=To carry out this research we must have access to patient records not generally available to us. As such, we propose to exercise our authority in section 1115A(b)(4)(B) of the Act to establish requirements for states and other entities participating in the testing of past, present, and future models under section 1115A of the Act to collect and report information that we have determined is necessary to monitor and evaluate such models. Thus, we propose to require model participants, and providers and suppliers working under the models operated by such participants to produce such individually identifiable health information and such other information as the Secretary identifies as being necessary to conduct the statutorily mandated research described above. Such research will include the monitoring and evaluation of such models. Further, we view engagement with other payers, both public and private, as a critical driver of the success of these models. CMS programs constitute only a share of any provider's revenue. Therefore, efforts to improve quality and reduce cost are more likely to be successful if signals are aligned across payers. Section 1115A of the Act specifically allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consider, in selecting which models to choose for testing, \u201cwhether the model demonstrates effective linkage with other public sector or private sector payers.\u201d Multi-payer models, such as but not limited to the Comprehensive Primary Care model, will conduct quality measurement across all patients regardless of payer in order to maximize alignment and increase efficiency. Construction of multi-payer quality measures requires the ability to identify all individuals subject to the model test regardless of payer. In addition, section 1115A also permits the Secretary to consider models that allow states to test and evaluate systems of all-payer payment reform for the medical care of residents of the state, including dual eligible individuals. Under the State Innovation Model (SIM), the Innovation Center is testing the ability for state governments to accelerate transformation. The premise of the SIM initiative is to support Governor-sponsored, multi-payer models that are focused on public and private sector collaboration to transform the state's delivery system. States have policy and regulatory authorities, as well as ongoing relationships with private payers, health plans, and providers that can accelerate delivery system reform. SIM models must impact the preponderance of care in the state and are expected to work with public and private payers to create multi-payer alignment. The evaluation of SIM will include all populations and payers involved in the state initiative, which in many cases includes private payers. The absence of identifiable data from private payers would result in considerable limitations on the level of evaluation conducted. Therefore, under this authority, we also propose to require the submission of identifiable health and utilization information for patients of private payers treated by providers/suppliers participating in the testing of a model under section 1115A of the Act when an explicit purpose of the model test is to engage private sector payers. If finalized, this regulation will provide clear legal authority for HIPAA Covered Entities to disclose any required protected health information. Identifiable data submitted by entities participating in the testing of models under section 1115A of the Act will meet CMS Acceptable Risks Safe Guards (ARS) guidelines. When data is expected to be exchanged over the internet such exchange will also meet all E-Gov requirements. In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, these data will be covered under a CMS established system of records (System No. 09-70-0591), which serves as the Master system for all demonstrations, evaluations, and research studies administered by the Innovation Center. These data will be stored until the evaluation is complete and all necessary policy deliberations have been finalized., 758903=We previously finalized in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74450) to make available for public reporting all PQRS GPRO measures collected in 2014 via the web interface. We now propose to expand public reporting of group-level measures by making all 2015 PQRS GPRO measure sets across group reporting mechanisms\u2014GPRO web interface, registry, and EHR\u2014available for public reporting on Physician Compare in CY 2016 for groups of 2 or more EPs, as appropriate by reporting mechanism. [6] Similarly, all measures reported by Shared Savings Program ACOs would be available for public reporting on Physician Compare. As with all quality measures proposed for inclusion on Physician Compare, only measures that prove to be valid, reliable, and accurate upon analysis and review at the conclusion of data collection will be included on the Web site. Also, we propose that measures must meet the public reporting criteria of a minimum sample size of 20 patients. We propose to include an indicator of which reporting mechanism was used and only measures deemed statistically comparable would be included on the site.7 We propose to publicly report all measures submitted and reviewed and found to be statistically valid and reliable in the Physician Compare downloadable file. However, we propose that not all of these measures necessarily would be included on the Physician Compare profile pages. Consumer testing has shown including too much information and/or measures that are not well understood by consumers on these pages can negatively impact a consumer's ability to make informed decisions. Our analysis of the measure data once collected, consumer testing, and stakeholder feedback would determine specifically which measures are published on profile pages on the Web site. Statistical analyses will ensure the measures included are statistically valid and reliable and comparable across data collection mechanisms. And, stakeholder feedback will ensure all measures meet current clinical standards. CMS will continue to reach out to stakeholders in the professional community, such as specialty societies, to ensure that the measures under consideration for public reporting remain clinically relevant and accurate. As measures are finalized significantly in advance of moment they are collected, it is possible that clinical guidelines can change rendering a measure no longer relevant. Publishing that measure can lead to consumer confusion regarding what best practices their health care professional should be subscribing to., 688957=Based on these considerations, we are proposing a new LCD process that would apply only to clinical diagnostic laboratory tests. Specifically, we are proposing to establish a process MACs must follow when developing clinical diagnostic laboratory test LCDs and encouraging MACs to collaborate on such policies across jurisdictions. We propose that the process apply to all new clinical diagnostic laboratory testing draft LCDs published on or after January 1, 2015. Consistent with Chapter 13, section 13.7.3 of the Medicare Program Integrity Manual (PIM), however, we further propose that this process will not apply to clinical diagnostic laboratory testing LCDs that are being revised for the following reasons: to liberalize an existing LCD; being issued for a compelling reason; making a non-substantive correction; providing a clarification; making a non-discretionary coverage or diagnosis coding update; making a discretionary diagnosis coding update that does not restrict; or revising to effectuate an Administrative Law Judge's decision on a Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) 522 challenge., 296369=In the CY 2014 final rule with comment period, we finalized for review a list of potentially misvalued services that included ultrasound guidance codes that had longer procedure times than the typical procedure with which the code is billed to Medicare. We also finalized our proposal to replace missing post-operative hospital evaluation and management (E/M) visit information and work time for approximately 100 global surgery codes. In CY 2014, we also considered a proposal to limit Medicare PFS payments for services furnished in a nonfacility setting when the PFS payment would exceed the combined Medicare payment under the PFS to the practitioner and facility payment made to either the ASC or hospital outpatient. Based upon extensive public comment we did not finalize this proposal. We address our current consideration of the potential use of OPPS data in establishing RVUs for PFS services in section II.A. of this proposed rule., 1016143=In the November 2011 final rule establishing the Shared Savings Program, we established the quality performance standards that ACOs must meet to be eligible to share in savings that are generated (76 FR 67870 through 67904). Quality performance measures are submitted by ACOs through a CMS web interface, currently the group practice reporting (GPRO) web interface, calculated by CMS from internal and claims data, and collected through a patient and caregiver experience of care survey., 810805=Section 1848(a)(8) of the Act, as added by section 3002(b) of the Affordable Care Act, provides that for covered professional services furnished by an eligible professional during 2015 or any subsequent year, if the eligible professional does not satisfactorily report data on quality measures for covered professional services for the quality reporting period for the year, the fee schedule amount for services furnished by such professional during the year (including the fee schedule amount for purposes of determining a payment based on such amount) shall be equal to the applicable percent of the fee schedule amount that would otherwise apply to such services. For 2016 and subsequent years, the applicable percent is 98.0 percent., 575428=In the CY 2014 final rule with comment period (78 FR 74414 through 74428), we defined the elements of the scope of service for CCM services required in order for a practitioner to bill Medicare for CCM services. In addition, we indicated that we intended to develop standards for practices that furnish CCM services to ensure that the practitioners who bill for these services have the capability to fully furnish them (78 FR 74415, 74418). At that time, we anticipated that we would propose these standards in this proposed rule. We actively sought input toward development of these standards by soliciting public comments on the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, through outreach to stakeholders in meetings, by convening a Technical Expert Panel, and by collaborating with federal partners such as the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. Our goal is to recognize the trend toward practice transformation and overall improved quality of care, while preventing unwanted and unnecessary care., 498742=For the list of covered telehealth services, see the CMS Web site at www.cms.gov/teleheath/. Requests to add services to the list of Medicare telehealth services must be submitted and received no later than December 31 of each calendar year to be considered for the next rulemaking cycle. For example, qualifying requests submitted before the end of CY 2014 will be considered for the CY 2016 proposed rule. Each request to add a service to the list of Medicare telehealth services must include any supporting documentation the requester wishes us to consider as we review the request. Because we use the annual PFS rulemaking process as a vehicle for making changes to the list of Medicare telehealth services, requestors should be advised that any information submitted is subject to public disclosure for this purpose. For more information on submitting a request for an addition to the list of Medicare telehealth services, including where to mail these requests, see the CMS Web site at www.cms.gov/telehealth/., 53213=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 4, 2015, 53273=On June 2, 2015, the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) hosted its 3rd Annual Federal Register Liaison Conference in the National Archives\u2019 McGowan Theater. What exactly is a Federal... Continue reading \u2192, 768250=Understanding the value consumers place on patient experience data and the commitment to reporting these data on Physician Compare, we propose publicly reporting in CY 2016 patient experience data from 2015 for all group practices of 2 or more EPs, who meet the specified sample size requirements and collect data via a CMS-specified certified CAHPS vendor. The patient experience data available are specifically the CAHPS for PQRS and CAHPS for ACO measures, which include the CG-CAHPS core measures. For group practices, we propose to publicly report for 2015 data on Physician Compare in 2016 the 12 summary survey measures previously finalized for 2014 data:, 543244=After considering the current process, including its strengths and weaknesses, and the alternatives to the current process described previously, we are proposing to modify our process to make all changes in the work and MP RVUs and the direct PE inputs for new, revised and potentially misvalued services under the PFS by proposing the changes in the proposed rule, beginning with the PFS proposed rule for CY 2016. We propose to include proposed values for all new, revised and potentially misvalued codes for which we have complete RUC recommendations by January 15th of the preceding year. For the CY 2016 rulemaking process, we would include in the proposed rule proposed values for all services for which we have RUC recommendations by January 15, 2015., 257004=Subsequent to the publication of the CY PFS 2014 final rule with comment period, several inconsistencies in the work time file came to our attention. First, for some services, the total work time, which is used in our PE methodology, did not equal the sum of the component parts (pre-service, intra-service, post-service, and times associated with global period visits). The times in the CY 2015 work time file reflect our proposed corrected values for total work time. Second, for a subset of services, the values in the pre-positioning time, pre-evaluation time, and pre-scrub-dress-wait time, were inadvertently transposed. We note that this error had no impact on calculation of the total times, but has been corrected in the CY 2015 work time file. Third, minor discrepancies for a series of interim final codes were identified between the work time file and the way we addressed these codes in the preamble text. Therefore, we have made adjustments to the work time file to reflect the decisions indicated in the preamble text. The work time file is available on the CMS Web site under the supporting data files for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/. Note that for comparison purposes, the CY 2014 work time file is located at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/PFS-Federal-Regulation-Notices-Items/CMS-1600-FC.html., 660228=In the May 2, 2014 final rule with comment period (79 FR 25436) entitled \u201cProspective Payment System for Federally Qualified Health Centers; Changes to Contracting Policies for Rural Health Clinics; and Changes to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 Enforcement Actions for Proficiency Testing Referral,\u201d we removed the regulatory requirements that NPs, PAs, CNMs, CSWs, and CPs furnishing services in a RHC must be employees of the RHC. RHCs are now allowed to contract with NPs, PAs, CNMs, CSWs, and CPs, as long as at least one NP or PA is employed by the RHC, as required under section 1861(aa)(2)(iii) of the Act., 870992=CMS is not the measure steward for most of the measures available for reporting under the PQRS. We rely on outside measure stewards and developers to maintain these measures. In Table 24, we are proposing that certain measures be removed from the PQRS measure set due to the measure owner/developer indicating that it will not be able to maintain the measure. We note that this proposal is contingent upon the measure owner/developer not being able to maintain the measure. Should we learn that a certain measure owner/developer is able to maintain the measure, or that another entity is able to maintain the measure in a manner that allows the measure to be available for reporting under the PQRS for the CY 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, we propose to keep the measure available for reporting under the PQRS and therefore not finalize our proposal to remove the measure. In addition, if, after the display of this proposed rule, we discover additional measures within the current PQRS measure set that a measure owner/developer can no longer maintain, we propose to remove these measures from reporting for the PQRS beginning in 2015. We will discuss any such instances in the CY 2015 PFS final rule with comment period., 248205=Mammography services are currently reported by and paid for using both CPT codes and G-codes. To meet the requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), we established the G-codes for CY 2002 to pay for mammography services using new digital technologies (G0202 screening mammography digital; G0204 diagnostic mammography digital; G0206 diagnostic mammography digital). We continued to pay for mammography billed using the CPT codes when the services were furnished with film technology (77055 mammogram one breast; 77056 mammogram both breasts; 77057 mammogram screening). As we discussed previously in this section, the RUC has recommended that all imaging codes, including mammography, be valued using digital rather than film inputs because film is no longer typical. A review of Medicare claims data shows that the mammography CPT codes are billed extremely infrequently, and that the G-codes are billed for the vast majority of mammography claims, confirming what the RUC has indicated regarding the use of digital technology. It appears that the typical mammography service is furnished using digital technology. As such, we do not believe there is a reason to continue the separate use of the CPT codes and the G-codes for mammography services since both sets of codes would have the same values when priced based upon the typical digital technology. Accordingly, we are proposing to delete the mammography G-codes beginning for CY 2015 and to pay all mammography using the CPT codes., 834211=In addition, we propose to modify \u00a7 414.90(j) to incorporate the following criteria for the satisfactory reporting of PQRS quality measures for group practices that registered to participate in the GPRO for the 12-month reporting period for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment using the GPRO web interface for groups practices of 100 or more eligible professionals: The group practice would report all CAHPS for PQRS survey measures via a certified survey vendor. In addition, the group practice would report on all measures included in the GPRO web interface; AND populate data fields for the first 248 consecutively ranked and assigned beneficiaries in the order in which they appear in the group's sample for each module or preventive care measure. If the pool of eligible assigned beneficiaries is less than 248, then the group practice would report on 100 percent of assigned beneficiaries. A group practice would be required to report on at least 1 measure for which there is Medicare patient data., 361905=In both reports, the OIG recommended that we adjust the number of E/M services identified with the studied global surgical payments to reflect the number of E/M services that are actually being furnished. However, since it is not necessary under our current global surgery payment policy for a surgeon to report the individual E/M services actually furnished during the global surgical period, we do not have objective data upon which to assess whether the RVUs for global period surgical services reflect the typical number or level of E/M services that are furnished. In the CY 2013 PFS proposed rule (77 FR 44738), we previously sought public comments on collecting these data. As summarized in the CY 2013 PFS final rule (77 FR 68913) we did not discover a consensus among stakeholders regarding either the most appropriate means to gather the data, or the need for, or the appropriateness of using such data in valuing these services. In response to our comment solicitation, some commenters urged us to accept the RUC survey data as accurate in spite of the OIG reports and other concerns that have been expressed regarding whether the visits included in the global periods reflected the typical case. Others suggested that we should conduct new surveys using the RUC approach or that we should mine hospital data to identify the typical number of visits furnished. Some comments suggested eliminating the 10- and 90-day global codes., 560017=In coordination with all of these initiatives, we also have continued to explore potential refinements to the PFS that would appropriately value care management within Medicare's statutory structure for fee-for-service physician payment and quality reporting. For example, in the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period, we adopted a policy to pay separately for care management involving the transition of a beneficiary from care furnished by a treating physician during a hospital stay to care furnished by the beneficiary's primary physician in the community (77 FR 68978 through 68993)., 1012167=Under the CPC initiative, CPC practice sites are required to report to CMS a subset of the CQMs that were selected in the EHR Incentive Program Stage 2 final rule for EPs to report under the EHR Incentive Program beginning in CY 2014 (for a list of CQMs that were selected in the EHR Incentive Program Stage 2 final rule for EPs to report under the EHR Incentive Program beginning in CY 2014, see 77 FR 54069 through 54075). We propose to retain the group reporting option for CPC practice sites as finalized in the CY 2014 PFS final rule, but to relax the requirement for the CQMs to cover three domains. Instead, we propose that, for CY 2015 only, under this group reporting option, the CPC practice site must report a minimum of nine CQMs from the CPC subset, and the nine CQMs reported must cover at least 2 domains, although we strongly encourage practice sites to report across more domains if feasible. Although the requirement to report across three domains is important because the domains are linked to the National Quality Strategy and used throughout CMS quality programs, the CPC practice sites are required to report from a limited number of CQMs that were selected for the EHR Incentive Program and are focused on a primary care population. Therefore, these CPC practice sites may not have measures to select from that cover three domains. Additionally, CPC practice sites are assessed for quality performance on measures other than electronically specified CQMs which do cover other National Quality Strategy domains. We invite public comment on this proposal., 493885=An entity participating in a federal telemedicine demonstration project that has been approved by, or received funding from, the Secretary as of December 31, 2000 is eligible to be an originating site regardless of its geographic location., 151190=We established the resource-based PE RVUs for each physicians' service in a final rule, published on November 2, 1998 (63 FR 58814), effective for services furnished in CY 1999. Based on the requirement to transition to a resource-based system for PE over a 4-year period, payment rates were not fully based upon resource-based PE RVUs until CY 2002. This resource-based system was based on two significant sources of actual PE data: The Clinical Practice Expert Panel (CPEP) data and the AMA's Socioeconomic Monitoring System (SMS) data. (These data sources are described in greater detail in the CY 2012 final rule with comment period (76 FR 73033).), 727507=Section 1128G(a)(1)(A)(vii) of the Act requires applicable manufacturers to report the name of the covered drug, device, biological or medical supply associated with that payment, if the payment is related to \u201cmarketing, education, or research\u201d of a particular covered drug, device, biological, or medical supply. Section 403.904(c)(8)(i) requires applicable manufacturers to report the marketed name for each drug or biological related to a payment or other transfer of value. At \u00a7 403.904(c)(8)(ii), we require an applicable manufacturer of devices or medical supplies to report one of the following: the marketed name; product category; or therapeutic area. In the February 8, 2013, final rule, we provided applicable manufactures with flexibility when it was determined that the marketed name for all devices and medical supplies may not be useful for the general audience. We did not define product categories or therapeutic areas in \u00a7 403.904(c). However, since implementation of the February 8, 2013 final rule and the development of the Open Payments system, we have determined that making the reporting requirements for marketed name across drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies will make the data fields consistent within the system, and also enhance consumer's use of the data., 823266=We seek public comment on our proposed satisfactory reporting criterion for individual eligible professionals reporting measures groups via registry for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment., 998805=In the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period (77 FR 69289), we established that \u201can eligible professional electing to utilize the informal review process must request an informal review by February 28 of the year in which the payment adjustment is being applied. For example, if an eligible professional requests an informal review related to the 2015 payment adjustment, the eligible professional would be required to submit his/her request for an informal review by February 28, 2015.\u201d As stated in the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period, we believed this deadline provided ample time for eligible professionals and group practices after their respective claims begin to be adjusted due to the payment adjustment. However, because PQRS data is used to establish the quality composite of the VM, we believe it is necessary to expand the informal review process to allow for some limited corrections of the PQRS data to be made. Therefore, we propose to modify the payment adjustment informal review deadline to within 30 days of the release of the feedback reports. For example, if the feedback reports for the 2016 payment adjustment (based on data collected for 2014 reporting periods) are released on August 31, 2015, an eligible professional or group practice would be required to submit a request for an informal review by September 30, 2015. We believe that by being able to notify eligible professionals and group practices of CMS' decision on the informal review request much earlier than we would have been able to do with the previous informal review request deadline we can provide a brief period for an eligible or group practice to make some limited corrections to its PQRS data. This resubmitted data could then be used to make corrections to the VM calculations, when appropriate., 992795=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we finalized requirements related to the parameters for the measures that would have to be reported to CMS by a QCDR for the purpose of its individual eligible professionals meeting the criteria for satisfactory participation under the PQRS (78 FR 74751 through 74753). Although we are not proposing to remove any of the requirements we finalized related to these parameters, we are proposing to modify the following parameters we finalized in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period related to measures that may be reported by a QCDR:, 740394=We post on the Web site the names of individual EPs who satisfactorily report under the PQRS, as well as those EPs who are successful electronic prescribers under the Medicare Electronic Prescribing (eRx) Incentive Program. Physician Compare contains a link to a downloadable database of all information on Physician Compare (https://data.medicare.gov/data/physician-compare), including information on this quality program participation. In addition, there is a section on each Medicare professional's profile page indicating with a green check mark the quality programs under which the EP satisfactorily or successfully reported. We propose to continue to include this information annually in the year following the year it is reported (for example, 2015 PQRS reporting will be included on the Web site in 2016)., 869587=In the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period, we finalized our proposal providing that if the NQF updates an endorsed measure that we have adopted for the PQRS in a manner that we consider to not substantively change the nature of the measure, we would use a subregulatory process to incorporate those updates to the measure specifications that apply to the program (77 FR 69207). We believe this adequately balances our need to incorporate non-substantive NQF updates to NQF-endorsed measures in the most expeditious manner possible, while preserving the public's ability to comment on updates that so fundamentally change an endorsed measure that it is no longer the same measure that we originally adopted. We also note that the NQF process incorporates an opportunity for public comment and engagement in the measure maintenance process. We will revise the Specifications Manual and post notices to clearly identify the updates and provide links to where additional information on the updates can be found. Updates will also be available on the CMS PQRS Web site at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/PQRS/index.html., 752425=For 2014, we also finalized publicly reporting 2014 PQRS measure data reported by individual EPs in late CY 2015 for individual PQRS quality measures specifically identified in the final rule with comment period, if technically feasible. Specifically, we finalized to make available for public reporting 20 individual measures collected through a registry, EHR, or claims (78 FR 74453 through 74454). These are measures that are in line with those measures reported by groups via the GPRO web interface., 534656=Thus, if we were to adopt this approach, we would need to address how to make payment for the services for which new or revised codes take effect for the following year but for which we did not receive RUC recommendations in time to include proposed work values and PE inputs in the proposed rule. Because the annual coding changes are effective on January 1st of a year, we would need a mechanism for practitioners to report services and be paid appropriately during the interval between the date the code takes effect and the time that we receive RUC recommendations and complete rulemaking to establish values for the new and revised codes. One option would be to establish G-codes with identical descriptors to the predecessors of the new and revised codes and, to the fullest extent possible, carry over the existing values for those codes. This would effectively preserve the status quo for one year., 262840=The RUC recommended creating a new direct PE input standard supply package \u201cImaging w/contrast, standard package\u201d for contrast enhanced imaging, with a price of $6.82. This price reflects the combined prices of the medical supplies included in the package; these items are listed in Table 9. We propose to accept this recommendation, but seek comment on whether all of the items included in the package are used in the typical case. The CY 2015 direct PE database reflects this proposed change and is available on the CMS Web site under the supporting data files for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/., 846167=Proposed Option 1: If a group practice chooses to use a qualified registry, in conjunction with reporting the CAHPS for PQRS survey measures, for the 12-month reporting period for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, the group practice would report all CAHPS for PQRS survey measures via a certified vendor, and report at least 6 additional measures, outside of CAHPS for PQRS, covering at least 2 of the NQS domains using the qualified registry. If less than 6 measures apply to the group practice, the group practice must report all applicable measures. Of these 6 measures, if any eligible professional in the group practice sees at least 1 Medicare patient in a face-to-face encounter, the group practice would be required to report on at least 1 measure in the cross-cutting measure set specified in Table 21. We note that this proposed option to report 6 additional measures, including at least 1 cross-cutting measure if a group practice sees at least 1 Medicare patient in a face-to-face encounter, is consistent with the proposed criterion for satisfactory reporting for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment via qualified registry. However, unlike the proposed criterion for satisfactory reporting for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment via qualified registry without CG-CAHPS, we are only proposing the requirement to report 1 measure in the cross-cutting measure set specified in Table 21 instead of 2 measures as the CAHPS for PQRS measures are contained in the cross-cutting measure set., 1004468=For CY 2012 and subsequent years, \u00a7 495.8(a)(2)(ii) requires an EP to successfully report the clinical quality measures selected by CMS to CMS or the states, as applicable, in the form and manner specified by CMS or the states, as applicable., 338968=Until we receive the information needed to revalue this service, we are proposing to maintain the work RVU for this code and revert to the same PE RVUs we used for CY 2013, adjusted for budget neutrality. We are proposing MP RVUs based on the five-year review update process as described in section II.C of this proposed rule. We believe this valuation will ameliorate the effect of the CY 2014 reduction in G0389 that resulted from reflection of the change in RVUs for the crosswalked code while we assess the valuation of this code through our usual methodologies. The proposed PE RVUs are contained in Addendum B available on the CMS Web site under downloads for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/PFS-Federal-Regulation-Notices.html., 561074=CCM is a unique PFS service designed to pay separately for non-face-to-face care coordination services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries with two or more chronic conditions. (See 78 FR 74414 for a more complete description of the beneficiaries for whom this service may be billed.) In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we indicated that, to recognize the additional resources required to provide CCM services to patients with multiple chronic conditions, we were creating the following code to use for reporting this service (78 FR 74422):, 121082=Amy Gruber, (410) 786-1542, for issues related to changes in geographic area designations for ambulance payment., 802231=With respect to when the quality measures data must be publicly reported, we propose that the QCDR must have the quality measures data by April 31 of the year following the applicable reporting period (that is, April 31, 2016, for reporting periods occurring in 2015). The proposed deadline of April 31 will provide QCDRs with one month to post quality measures data and information following the March 31 deadline for the QCDRs to transmit quality measures data for purposes of the PQRS payment adjustments. We also propose that this data be available on a continuous basis and be continuously updated as the measures undergo changes in measure title and description, as well as when new performance results are calculated., 136586=OBRA '89Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (101), 335684=When Medicare began paying for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) ultrasound screening in CY 2007, we created HCPCS code G0389 (Ultrasound, B-scan and/or real time with image documentation; for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening), and set the RVUs at the same level as CPT code 76775 (Ultrasound, retroperitoneal (e.g., renal, aorta, nodes), B-scan and/or real time with image documentation; limited). We noted in the CY 2007 final rule with comment period that CPT code 76775 was used to report the service when furnished as a diagnostic test and that we believed the service reflected by G0389 used equivalent resources and work intensity to those contained in CPT code 76775 (71 FR 69664 through 69665)., 891058=In Table 25 below, we specify our proposals to change the way in which previously established measures in the PQRS will be reported beginning in 2015. Please note that, in Table 25, we provide our explanation as to how we are proposing to change the way the measure is reported, as well as a corresponding rationale for this proposed change., 716151=(7) Whether entities submitting claims for services furnished by substitute physicians should include on the CMS-1500 claim form or on the appropriate electronic claim the identity of the substitute physician and, if so, whether the CMS-1500 claim form or the appropriate electronic claim should be revised to accommodate such a requirement., 697698=Effective January 1, 1998, section 1802(b) of the Act permits certain physicians and practitioners to opt-out of Medicare if certain conditions are met, and to furnish through private contracts services that would otherwise be covered by Medicare. For those physicians and practitioners who opt- out of Medicare in accordance with section 1802(b) of the Act, the mandatory claims submission and limiting charge rules of section 1848(g) of the Act would not apply. As a result, if the conditions necessary for an effective opt-out are met, physicians and practitioners are permitted to privately contract with Medicare beneficiaries and to charge them without regard to Medicare's limiting charge rules. Regulations governing the requirements and procedures for private contracts appear at 42 CFR part 405, subpart D., 432666=Some specialties had premium rates that differed for surgery, surgery with obstetrics, and non-surgery. To account for the presence of different classes in the MP premium data and the task of mapping these premiums to procedures, we calculated distinct risk factors for surgical, surgical with obstetrics, and nonsurgical procedures. However, the availability of data by surgery and nonsurgery varied across specialties. Consistent with the CY 2010 MP RVU update, because no single approach accurately addressed the variability in premium classes among specialties, we employed several methods for calculating average premiums by specialty. These methods are discussed below., 750467=We also finalized a decision to publicly report in CY 2015 on Physician Compare performance on certain measures that group practices report via registries and EHRs in 2014 for the PQRS GPRO (78 FR 74451). Specifically, we finalized making available for public reporting performance on 16 registry measures and 13 EHR measures (78 FR 74451). These measures are consistent with the measures available for public reporting via the web interface. We will indicate the mechanism by which these data were collected and only those data deemed statistically comparable, valid, and reliable would be published on the site.7, 753010=Finally, in support of the HHS-wide Million Hearts Initiative, we finalized a decision to publicly report, no earlier than CY 2015, performance rates on measures in the PQRS Cardiovascular Prevention measures group at the individual EP level for data collected in 2014 for the PQRS (78 FR 74454). See Table 19 for a summary of our final policies for public reporting data on Physician Compare., 177385=Supplemental survey data on independent labs from the College of American Pathologists were implemented for payments beginning in CY 2005. Supplemental survey data from the National Coalition of Quality Diagnostic Imaging Services (NCQDIS), representing independent diagnostic testing facilities (IDTFs), were blended with supplementary survey data from the American College of Radiology (ACR) and implemented for payments beginning in CY 2007. Neither IDTFs, nor independent labs, participated in the PPIS. Therefore, we continue to use the PE/HR that was developed from their supplemental survey data., 830894=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we established a deadline of September 30 of the applicable reporting period (that is, September 30, 2014, for reporting periods occurring in 2014) for a group practice to register to participate in the GPRO (78 FR 74456). While we still seek to provide group practices with as much time as feasible to decide whether to register to participate in the PQRS as a GPRO, we weigh this priority with others, such as our desire to provide more timely feedback to participants of the PQRS, as well as other CMS quality reporting programs such as the VM. Since participation in the VM is tied to PQRS participation as discussed in section III.N. of this proposed rule, we have found that having a GPRO registration deadline so late in time would not allow us to collect information related to group practice participation in time to provide PQRS and VM participants with feedback reports earlier in time. Therefore, in an effort to provide timelier feedback, we are proposing to change the deadline by which a group practice must register to participate in the GPRO to June 30 of the applicable 12-month reporting period (that is, June 30, 2015, for reporting periods occurring in 2015). This proposed change would allow us to provide timelier feedback while still providing group practices with over 6 months to determine whether they should participate in the PQRS GPRO or, in the alternative, participate in the PQRS as individual eligible professionals. We invite public comment on this proposal., 637060=The adoption of the new OMB delineations and the updated RUCA codes would affect whether or not transports would be eligible for other rural adjustments under the ambulance fee schedule statute and regulations. For ground ambulance transports where the point of pick-up is in a rural area, the mileage rate is increased by 50 percent for each of the first 17 miles (\u00a7 414.610(c)(5)(i)). For air ambulance services where the point of pick-up is in a rural area, the total payment (base rate and mileage rate) is increased by 50 percent (\u00a7 414.610(c)(5)(i)). Furthermore, under section 1834(l)(13) of the Act (as amended by section 104(a) of the PAMA), for ground ambulance transports furnished through March 31, 2015, transports originating in rural areas are paid based on a rate (both base rate and mileage rate) that is 3 percent higher than otherwise is applicable. (See also \u00a7 414.610(c)(1)(ii))., 418417=The proposed MP RVUs were calculated by a CMS contractor based on updated MP premium data obtained from state insurance rate filings. The methodology used in calculating the proposed CY 2015 review and update of resource-based MP RVUs largely parallels the process used in the CY 2010 update. The calculation requires using information on specialty-specific MP premiums linked to a specific service based upon the relative risk factors of the various specialties that furnish a particular service. Because MP premiums vary by state and specialty, the MP premium information must be weighted geographically and by specialty. Accordingly, the proposed MP RVUs are based upon three data sources: CY 2011 and CY 2012 MP premium data; CY 2013 Medicare payment and utilization data; and CY 2015 proposed work RVUs and geographic practice cost indices (GPCIs)., 124273=Comments received timely will also be available for public inspection as they are received, generally beginning approximately 3 weeks after publication of a document, at the headquarters of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21244, Monday through Friday of each week from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. To schedule an appointment to view public comments, phone 1-800-743-3951., 569360=In this rule, we are proposing to revise the policy that we adopted in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, and to amend our regulations to codify the requirements for CCM services furnished incident to a practitioner's services. Specifically, we are proposing to remove the requirement that, in order to count the time spent by clinical staff providing aspects of CCM services toward the CCM time requirement, the clinical staff person must be a direct employee of the practitioner or the practitioner's practice. (We note that the existing requirement that these services be provided by clinical staff, specifically, rather than by other auxiliary personnel is an element of the service for both CCM and TCM services, rather than a requirement imposed by the \u201cincident to\u201d rules themselves.) We are also proposing to remove the restriction that services provided by clinical staff under general (rather than direct) supervision may be counted only if they are provided outside of the practice's normal business hours. Under our proposed revised policy, then, the time spent by clinical staff providing aspects of CCM services can be counted toward the CCM time requirement at any time, provided that the clinical staff are under the general supervision of a practitioner and all requirements of the \u201cincident to\u201d regulations at \u00a7 410.26 are met., 698783=The private contracting regulation at \u00a7 405.450 describes certain opt-out determinations made by Medicare, and the process that physicians, practitioners, and beneficiaries may use to appeal those determinations. Section 405.450(a) describes the process available for physicians or practitioners to appeal Medicare enrollment determinations related to opting out of the program, and \u00a7 405.450(b) describes the process available to challenge payment determinations related to claims for services furnished by physicians who have opted out. Both provisions refer to \u00a7 405.803, the Part B claims appeals process that was in place at the time the opt-out regulations were issued (November 2, 1998). When those regulations were issued, a process for a physician or practitioner to appeal enrollment related decisions had not been implemented in regulation. Thus, to ensure an appeals process was available to physicians and practitioners for opt-out related issues, we chose to utilize the existing claims appeals process in \u00a7 405.803 for both enrollment and claims related appeals., 758342=We are continuing the expansion of public reporting on Physician Compare by proposing to make an even broader set of quality measures available for publication on the Web site. We started the phased approach with a small number of possible PQRS GPRO web interface measures for 2012, and have been steadily building on this to provide Medicare consumers with more information to help them make informed health care decisions. As a result, we are now proposing to increase the measures available for public reporting., 148083=The work RVUs established for the initial fee schedule, which was implemented on January 1, 1992, were developed with extensive input from the physician community. A research team at the Harvard School of Public Health developed the original work RVUs for most codes under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In constructing the code-specific vignettes used in determining the original physician work RVUs, Harvard worked with panels of experts, both inside and outside the federal government, and obtained input from numerous physician specialty groups., 53881=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 1, 2015, 207955=Interest Rate: In the CY 2013 final rule with comment period (77 FR 68902), we updated the interest rates used in developing an equipment cost per minute calculation. The interest rate was based on the Small Business Administration (SBA) maximum interest rates for different categories of loan size (equipment cost) and maturity (useful life). The interest rates are listed in Table 3. (See 77 FR 68902 for a thorough discussion of this issue.), 155550=Section 1848(c)(2)(B)(i) of the Act requires that we review RVUs no less often than every 5 years. Prior to CY 2013, we conducted periodic reviews of work RVUs and PE RVUs independently. We completed five-year reviews of work RVUs that were effective for calendar years 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012., 419316=Similar to the previous update, we calculated the proposed MP RVUs using specialty-specific MP premium data because they represent the actual expense incurred by practitioners to obtain MP insurance. We obtained MP premium data primarily from state departments of insurance. When the state insurance departments did not provide data, we used state rate filing data from the Perr and Knight database, which derives its data from state insurance departments. We used information obtained from MP insurance rate filings with effective dates in 2011 and 2012. These were the most current data available during our data collection process., 622219=The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee Reports that accompanied the 1965 Social Security Amendments suggest that the Congress intended that\u2014, 74592=1 action from June 2014, 320161=In the CY 2014 final rule with comment period (78 FR 74340), we described in detail our interim valuation of these codes. We indicated we established interim final work RVUs for these codes below those recommended by the RUC because we did not believe that the RUC-recommended work RVUs accounted for the substantial decrease in time it takes to furnish these services since the last time they were valued as reflected in the RUC survey data for these four codes. Since the RUC provided no indication that the intensity of the procedures had changed, we believed that the work RVUs should reflect the reduction in time. We also established interim final direct PE inputs for these four codes based on the RUC-recommended inputs without any refinement. These recommendations included the removal of the radiographic-fluoroscopy room for 62310, 62311, and 62318 and a portable C-arm for 62319., 818908=We seek public comment on our proposed satisfactory reporting criterion for individual eligible professionals reporting via claims or registry for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment., 160489=The CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74230) implemented changes to the PFS and other Medicare Part B payment policies. It also finalized many of the CY 2013 interim final RVUs and established interim final RVUs for new and revised codes for CY 2014 to ensure that our payment system is updated to reflect changes in medical practice, coding changes, and the relative values of services. It also implemented section 635 of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (Pub. L. 112-240, enacted on January 2, 2013) (ATRA), which revised the equipment utilization rate assumption for advanced imaging services furnished on or after January 1, 2014., 699926=In May 16, 2012 Federal Register (77 FR 29002), we published a final rule entitled \u201cMedicare and Medicaid Program; Regulatory Provisions to Promote Program Efficiency, Transparency and Burden Reduction.\u201d In that final rule, we deleted the provisions relating to initial determinations, appeals, and reopenings of Medicare Part A and Part B claims, and relating to determinations and appeals regarding an individual's entitlement to benefits under Medicare Part A and Part B, which were contained in part 405, subparts G and H (including \u00a7 405.803) because these provisions were obsolete and had been replaced by the regulations at part 405, subpart I. We inadvertently neglected to revise the cross-reference in \u00a7 405.450(a) and (b) of the private contracting regulations to direct appeals of opt-out determinations through the current appeal process. However, it is important to note that our policy regarding the appeal of opt-out determinations did not change when the appeal regulations at part 405, subpart I were finalized., 129878=BBRA[Medicare, Medicaid and State Child Health Insurance Program] Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 106-113), 1013899=Under section 1899 of the Act, CMS has established the Medicare Shared Savings program (Shared Savings Program) to facilitate coordination and cooperation among providers to improve the quality of care for Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) beneficiaries and reduce the rate of growth in health care costs. Eligible groups of providers and suppliers, including physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers, may participate in the Shared Savings Program by forming or participating in an Accountable Care Organization (ACO). The final rule implementing the Shared Savings Program appeared in the November 2, 2011 Federal Register (Medicare Shared Savings Program: Accountable Care Organizations Final Rule (76 FR 67802))., 822839=Although we are proposing satisfactory reporting criterion for individual eligible professionals to report measures groups via registry for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment that is consistent with criterion finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive, please note, however, in this section III.K of this proposed rule, we are proposing to change the definition of a PQRS measures group., 323168=Two commenters stated that critical PE inputs, including an epidural needle, loss or resistance syringe and spinal needle, were missing from the valuation. One commenter indicated that a radiographic-fluoroscopic room should be included for CPT codes 62310, 62311 and 62318; and a mobile C-Arm should be included for CPT code 62319. Another commenter requested the decreases in the PE RVUs be phased in over a period of years., 638977=The use of the revised OMB delineations and the updated RUCA codes would mean the recognition of new urban and rural boundaries based on the population migration that occurred over a 10-year period, between 2000 and 2010. Based on the latest United States Postal Service (USPS) ZIP code file, there are a total of 42,914 ZIP codes in the U.S. The geographic designations for approximately 99.48 percent of ZIP codes would be unchanged by OMB's revised delineations and the updated RUCA codes. There are a similar number of ZIP codes that would change from rural to urban (122, or 0.28 percent) and from urban to rural (100, or 0.23 percent). In general, it is expected that ambulance providers and suppliers in 100 ZIP codes within 11 states may experience payment increases if we adopt the revised OMB delineations and the updated RUCA codes, as these areas would be redesignated from urban to rural. The state of Ohio would have the most ZIP codes changing from urban to rural with a total of 40, or 2.69 percent. Ambulance providers and suppliers in 122 ZIP codes within 22 states may experience payment decreases if we adopt the revised OMB delineations and the updated RUCA codes, as these areas would be redesignated from rural to urban. The state of West Virginia would have the most ZIP codes changing from rural to urban (17, or 1.82 percent), while Connecticut would have the greatest percentage of ZIP codes changing from rural to urban (15 ZIP codes, or 3.37 percent). Our findings are illustrated in Table 17., 770570=We previously finalized in the 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74454) that 20 2014 PQRS measures for individual EPs collected via registry, EHR, or claims would be available for public reporting in late 2015, if technically feasible. We propose to expand on this in two ways. First, we propose to publicly report these same 20 measures for 2013 PQRS data in early 2015. Publicly reporting these 2013 individual measures will help ensure individual level measures are made available as soon as possible. Consumers are looking for measures about individual doctors and other health care professionals, and this would make these quality data available to the public sooner., 687236=After assessment of the current LCD process, the Palmetto pilot project, the requirements of the PAMA, and the vast field of clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, including molecular diagnostic tests, we are proposing a revised LCD process for all new draft clinical diagnostic laboratory test LCDs published on or after January 1, 2015. This process would carefully balance the need for an expedited process to handle the vast number of clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, including the rapidly growing universe of molecular diagnostic tests. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) currently includes 16,000 registered genetic tests for over 4,000 conditions (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/). We have a responsibility to ensure that appropriate tests are covered by Medicare and that coverage is limited to tests for which the test results are used by the ordering physician in the management of the beneficiary's specific medical problem (as required in \u00a7 410.32(a)). Coverage for diagnostic laboratory tests may be achieved through various policy vehicles, including an NCD, LCD, or claim-by-claim adjudication at the local contractor level. For most molecular diagnostic tests, coverage has been determined by the MACs, through LCDs or claim-by-claim adjudication. Few such tests have been the subject of an NCD, to date. This concentration of coverage decisions at the local level, and the responsibility of the agency to allow coverage of appropriate tests provide additional reasons to provide MACs with a more streamlined LCD process., 152794=Section 212 of the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 106-113, enacted on November 29, 1999) (BBRA) directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to establish a process under which we accept and use, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with sound data practices, data collected or developed by entities and organizations to supplement the data we normally collect in determining the PE component. On May 3, 2000, we published the interim final rule (65 FR 25664) that set forth the criteria for the submission of these supplemental PE survey data. The criteria were modified in response to comments received, and published in the Federal Register (65 FR 65376) as part of a November 1, 2000 final rule. The PFS final rules published in 2001 and 2003, respectively, (66 FR 55246 and 68 FR 63196) extended the period during which we would accept these supplemental data through March 1, 2005., 156612=With regard to MP RVUs, we completed five-year reviews of MP that were effective in CY 2005 and CY 2010. This proposed rule includes a proposal for a five-year review for CY 2015., 293387=To fulfill our statutory mandate, we have identified and reviewed numerous potentially misvalued codes as specified in section 1848(c)(2)(K)(ii) of the Act, and we plan to continue our work examining potentially misvalued codes in these areas over the upcoming years. As part of our current process, we identify potentially misvalued codes for review, and request recommendations from the RUC and other public commenters on revised work RVUs and direct PE inputs for those codes. The RUC, through its own processes, also identifies potentially misvalued codes for review. Through our public nomination process for potentially misvalued codes established in the CY 2012 PFS final rule with comment period, other individuals and stakeholder groups submit nominations for review of potentially misvalued codes as well., 811810=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (see Table 47 at 78 FR 74479), we finalized the following criteria for satisfactory reporting for the submission of individual quality measures via claims and registry for the 2014 PQRS incentive: For the 12-month reporting period for the 2014 PQRS incentive, the eligible professional would report at least 9 measures, covering at least 3 of the NQS domains, OR, if less than 9 measures apply to the eligible professional, report 1-8 measures, AND report each measure for at least 50 percent of the Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies. Measures with a 0 percent performance rate would not be counted. For an eligible professional who reports fewer than 9 measures covering less than 3 NQS domains via the claims- or registry-based reporting mechanism, the eligible professional would be subject to the measure application validity (MAV) process, which would allow us to determine whether the eligible professional should have reported quality data codes for additional measures., 120784=Pam West, (410) 786-2302, for issues related to conditions for therapists in private practice., 897942=In the CY 2014 PFS proposed rule, we proposed (78 FR 43448) to increase the number of measures that may be included in a measures group from a minimum of 4 measures to a minimum of 6. We proposed increasing the minimum number of measures that may be contained in a measures group in accordance with increasing the number of individual measures to be reported via claims and registry. However, we did not finalize this proposal, stating that, although we still plan to increase the minimum number of measures in a measures group in the future, we would work with the measure developers and owners of these measures groups to appropriately add measures to measures groups that only contain four measures within the measures group (78 FR 74730). We have worked with the measure owners and developers and are again proposing to increase the number of measures that may be included in a measures group from a minimum of 4 measures to a minimum of 6., 773863=We would analyze the component measures that make up each of these measure groups to see if a statistically viable composite can be constructed with the data reported for 2015. In addition, we propose to use the same methodology outlined above for group practices to develop benchmarks for individual practitioners. As noted for group practices, we believe that providing composite scores and benchmarks will give consumers the tools needed to most accurately interpret the quality data published on Physician Compare., 576753=As we worked to develop appropriate practice standards that would meet this goal, we consistently found that many of the standards we thought were important overlapped in significant ways with the scope of service or with the billing requirements for the CCM services that had been finalized in the CY 2014 final rule with comment period. In cases where the standards we identified were not unique to CCM requirements, we found that the standards overlapped with other Medicare requirements or other federal requirements that apply generally to health care practitioners. Based upon the feedback we had received, we sought to avoid duplicating other requirements or, worse, imposing conflicting requirements on practitioners that would furnish CCM services. Given the standards and requirements already in place for health care practitioners and that will apply to those who furnish and bill for CCM services, we have decided not to propose an additional set of standards that must be met in order for practitioners to furnish and bill for CCM services. Instead of proposing a new set of standards applicable to only CCM services, we have decided to emphasize that certain requirements are inherent in the elements of the existing scope of service for CCM services, and clarify that these must be met in order to bill for CCM services., 478491=As previously noted, section 102 of the PAMA extended the 1.0 work GPCI floor through March 31, 2015. Therefore, the CY 2015 work GPCIs and summarized GAFs have been revised to reflect the 1.0 work floor. Additionally, as required by sections 1848(e)(1)(G) and 1848(e)(1)(I) of the Act, the 1.5 work GPCI floor for Alaska and the 1.0 PE GPCI floor for frontier states are permanent, and therefore, applicable in CY 2015. See Addenda D and E for the CY 2015 GPCIs and summarized GAFs., 142725=This major proposed rule would revise payment polices under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) and make other policy changes related to Medicare Part B payment. These changes would be applicable to services furnished in CY 2015., 477111=Section 1848(e)(1)(C) of the Act requires us to review and, if necessary, adjust the GPCIs at least every 3 years. Section 1848(e)(1)(C) of the Act requires that \u201cif more than 1 year has elapsed since the date of the last previous adjustment, the adjustment to be applied in the first year of the next adjustment shall be1/2of the adjustment that otherwise would be made.\u201d We completed a review and finalized updated GPCIs in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74390). Since the last GPCI update had been implemented over 2 years, CY 2011 and CY 2012, we phased in1/2of the latest GPCI adjustment in CY 2014. We also revised the cost share weights that correspond to all three GPCIs in the CY 2014 PFS final rule. We calculated a corresponding geographic adjustment factor (GAF) for each PFS locality. The GAFs are a weighted composite of each area's work, PE and MP GPCIs using the national GPCI cost share weights. Although the GAFs are not used in computing the fee schedule payment for a specific service, we provide them because they are useful in comparing overall areas costs and payments. The actual effect on payment for any actual service will deviate from the GAF to the extent that the proportions of work, PE and MP RVUs for the service differ from those of the GAF., 633427=Based on this classification, and consistent with our current policy (71 FR 69715), we would continue to designate any census tracts falling at or above RUCA level 4.0 as rural areas for purposes of payment for ambulance services under the ambulance fee schedule. As discussed in the CY 2007 PFS final rule (71 FR 69715), the Office of Rural Health Policy within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) determines eligibility for its rural grant programs through the use of the RUCA code methodology. Under this methodology, HRSA designates any census tract that falls in RUCA level 4.0 or higher as a rural census tract. In addition to designating any census tracts falling at or above RUCA level 4.0 as rural areas, under the updated RUCA code definitions, HRSA has also designated as rural census tracts, those census tracts with RUCA codes 2 or 3 that are at least 400 square miles in area with a population density of no more than 35 people. We refer readers to HRSA's Web site: ftp://ftp.hrsa.gov/ruralhealth/Eligibility2005.pdf for additional information. Consistent with the HRSA guidelines discussed above, we are proposing, beginning in CY 2015, to designate as rural areas (1) those census tracts that fall at or above RUCA level 4.0, and (2) those census tracts that fall within RUCA levels 2 or 3 that are at least 400 square miles in area with a population density of no more than 35 people. As discussed in the CY 2007 PFS final rule (71 FR 69715), we continue to believe that HRSA's guidelines accurately identify rural census tracts throughout the country, and thus would be appropriate to apply for ambulance payment purposes. We invite comments on this proposal., 741358=With the Physician Compare redesign, we added a quality programs section to each group practice profile page in order to indicate which group practices are satisfactorily participating in the Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) under the PQRS or are successful electronic prescribers under the eRx Incentive Program. We have also included a notation and check mark for individuals that successfully participate in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program, as authorized by section 1848(o)(3)(D) of the Act. We propose to continue to include this information annually in the year following the year it is reported (for example, 2015 data will be included on the Web site in 2016)., 337272=Subsequent to the publication of the CY 2014 final rule, a stakeholder suggested that the reduction in the RVUs for G0389 did not accurately reflect the resources involved in furnishing the service and asked that CMS consider using an alternative crosswalk. Specifically, the stakeholder stated that the type of equipment typically used in furnishing G0389 is different than that used for CPT code 76775, the time involved in furnishing G0389 is greater than that of CPT code 76775, and the specialty that typically furnishes G0389 is different than the one that typically furnishes CPT code 76775. The stakeholder suggested an alternative crosswalk of CPT code 76705 (Ultrasound, abdominal, real time with image documentation; limited (eg, single organ, quadrant, follow-up))., 614777=The payment add-ons under section 1834(l)(13) of the Act have been extended several times. Recently, section 1104(a) of the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013, enacted on December 26, 2013, as Division B (Medicare and Other Health Provisions) of Pub L. 113-67, amended section 1834(l)(13)(A) of the Act to extend the payment add-ons described above through March 31, 2014. Subsequently, section 104(a) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-93, enacted on April 1, 2014) amended section 1834(l)(13)(A) of the Act to extend the payment add-ons again through March 31, 2015. Thus, these payment add-ons also apply to covered ground ambulance transports furnished before April 1, 2015. We are proposing to revise \u00a7 414.610(c)(1)(ii) to conform the regulations to these statutory requirements. (For a discussion of past legislation extending section 1834(l)(13) of the Act, please see the CY 2014 PFS final rule (78 FR 74438 through 74439))., 423156=For the proposed CY 2015 MP RVU update, sufficient and reliable premium data were available for 41 specialty types, which we used to develop specialty-specific malpractice risk factors. (See Table 13 for a list of these specialties.), 154112=In the CY 2007 PFS final rule with comment period (71 FR 69624), we revised the methodology for calculating direct PE RVUs from the top-down to the bottom-up methodology beginning in CY 2007. We adopted a 4-year transition to the new PE RVUs. This transition was completed for CY 2010. In the CY 2010 PFS final rule with comment period, we updated the practice expense per hour (PE/HR) data that are used in the calculation of PE RVUs for most specialties (74 FR 61749). In CY 2010, we began a 4-year transition to the new PE RVUs using the updated PE/HR data, which was completed for CY 2013., 479020=As discussed in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74380) the updated GPCIs were calculated by a contractor to CMS. We used updated Bureau of Labor and Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics (BLS OES) data (2009 through 2011) as a replacement for 2006 through 2008 data for purposes of calculating the work GPCI and the employee compensation component and purchased services component of the PE GPCI. We also used updated U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) data (2008 through 2010) as a replacement for 2006 through 2008 data for calculating the office rent component of the PE GPCI. To calculate the MP GPCI we used updated malpractice premium data (2011 and 2012) from state departments of insurance as a replacement for 2006 through 2007 premium data. We also noted that we do not adjust the medical equipment, supplies and other miscellaneous expenses component of the PE GPCI because we continue to believe there is a national market for these items such that there is not a significant geographic variation in relative costs. Additionally, we updated the GPCI cost share weights consistent with the modifications made to the 2006-based MEI cost share weights in the CY 2014 final rule. As discussed in the CY 2014 final rule with comment period, use of the revised GPCI cost share weights changed the weighting of the subcomponents within the PE GPCI (employee wages, office rent, purchased services, and medical equipment and supplies). For a detailed explanation of how the GPCI update was developed, see the CY 2014 final rule with comment period (78 FR 74380 through 74391)., 609773=In the CY 2005 PFS final rule with comment period (69 FR 66357 through 66359), we established criteria for furnishing outpatient per diem ESRD-related services in partial month scenarios. We specified that use of per diem ESRD-related services is intended to accommodate unusual circumstances when the outpatient ESRD-related services would not be paid for under the monthly capitation payment (MCP), and that use of the per diem services are limited to the circumstances listed below., 222610=In this section, we discuss other CY 2015 proposals and revisions related to direct PE inputs for specific services. The proposed direct PE inputs are included in the proposed rule CY 2015 direct PE input database, which is available on the CMS Web site under downloads for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/PFS-Federal-Regulation-Notices.html., 284337=Section 1848(c)(1)(B) of the Act defines the PE component as \u201cthe portion of the resources used in furnishing the service that reflects the general categories of expenses (such as office rent and wages of personnel, but excluding malpractice expenses) comprising practice expenses.\u201d Section 1848 (c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act requires that PE RVUs be determined based upon the relative PE resources involved in furnishing the service. (See section II.A. of this proposed rule for more detail on the PE component.), 703794=The private contracting regulations at \u00a7 405.420(e), \u00a7 405.425(a) and \u00a7 405.455 all use the term Medicare+Choice when referring to Part C plans. However, we no longer use the term Medicare+Choice when referring to Part C plans; instead the plans are referred to as Medicare Advantage plans. When part 422 of the regulations was updated on January 28, 2005 (70 FR 4741), we inadvertently neglected to revise \u00a7 405.420(e), \u00a7 405.425(a) and \u00a7 405.455 to replace the term Medicare+Choice with Medicare Advantage plan., 849766=Proposed Option 2: If a group practice chooses to use a direct EHR product that is CEHRT or EHR data submission vendor that is CEHRT in conjunction with reporting the CAHPS for PQRS survey measures, for the 12-month reporting period for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, the group practice would report all CAHPS for PQRS survey measures via a certified vendor, and report at least 6 additional measures, outside of CAHPS for PQRS, covering at least 2 of the NQS domains using the direct EHR product that is CEHRT or EHR data submission vendor that is CEHRT. If less than 6 measures apply to the group practice, the group practice must report all applicable measures. Of the additional 6 measures that must be reported in conjunction with reporting the CAHPS for PQRS survey measures, a group practice would be required to report on at least 1 measure for which there is Medicare patient data. We note that this proposed option to report 6 additional measures is consistent with the proposed criterion for satisfactory reporting for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment via EHR without CAHPS for PQRS, since the CAHPS for PQRS survey only addresses 1 NQS domain., 115940=Comment date: To be assured consideration, comments must be received at one of the addresses provided below, no later than 5 p.m. on September 2, 2014., 675914=On April 1, 2014, the PAMA was enacted and section 216 addresses Medicare payment and coverage policies for clinical diagnostic laboratory testing. In regard to coverage policies, section 216 amended the statute by adding section 1834A(g) of the Act, which establishes mandates related to issuance of local coverage policies by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests. The law states: \u201cA medicare administrative contractor shall only issue a coverage policy with respect to a clinical diagnostic laboratory test in accordance with the process for making a local coverage determination (as defined in section 1869(f)(2)(B)), including the appeals and review process for local coverage determinations under part 426 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations).\u201d, 178034=Consistent with our past practice, the previous indirect PE/HR values from the supplemental surveys for these specialties were updated to CY 2006 using the MEI to put them on a comparable basis with the PPIS data., 488596=Section 1834(m)(4)(F)(i) of the Act defines Medicare telehealth services to include consultations, office visits, office psychiatry services, and any additional service specified by the Secretary, when furnished via a telecommunications system. We first implemented this provision, which was effective October 1, 2001, in the CY 2002 PFS final rule with comment period (66 FR 55246). We established a process in the CY 2003 PFS final rule with comment period (67 FR 79988) for annual updates to the list of Medicare telehealth services as required by section 1834(m)(4)(F)(ii) of the Act., 611860=In the CY 2011 PFS final rule with comment period (75 FR 73295 through 73296), we changed our policy for the home dialysis MCP service to require the MCP physician or practitioner to furnish at least one face-to-face patient visit per month as a condition of payment. However, we inadvertently did not modify our billing guidelines for home dialysis (less than a full month) to be consistent with partial month scenarios for center-based dialysis patients. Stakeholders have recently brought this inconsistency to our attention. After reviewing this issue, we are proposing to allow the MCP physician or practitioner to bill for the age appropriate home dialysis MCP service (as described by HCPCS codes 90963 through 90966) for the home dialysis (less than a full month) scenario if the MCP physician or practitioner furnishes a complete monthly assessment of the ESRD beneficiary and at least one face-to-face patient visit. For example, if a home dialysis patient was hospitalized during the month and at least one face-to-face outpatient visit and complete monthly assessment was furnished, the MCP physician or practitioner should bill for the full home dialysis MCP service. We believe that this proposed change to home dialysis (less than a full month) provides consistency with our policy for partial month scenarios pertaining to patients dialyzing in a dialysis center. If this proposal is adopted, we would modify the Medicare Claims Processing Manual to reflect the revised billing guidelines for home dialysis in the less than a full month scenario., 819336=In the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period, we finalized the following criterion for the satisfactory reporting for individual eligible professionals reporting individual measures via a direct EHR that is CEHRT or an EHR data submission vendor that is CEHRT for the 2014 PQRS incentive: Report 9 measures covering at least 3 of the NQS domains. If an eligible professional's CEHRT does not contain patient data for at least 9 measures covering at least 3 domains, then the eligible professional must report all of the measures for which there is Medicare patient data. An eligible professional must report on at least 1 measure for which there is Medicare patient data (see Table 47 at 78 FR 74479)., 324081=After analyzing the comments and considering valuation of these codes, we believe that we need to reassess our valuation of these codes and require additional information in order to do so. Our data show that these epidural codes are frequently billed with imaging guidance. For example, CPT code 62310 was billed with CPT code 77003 (Fluoroscopic guidance and localization of needle or catheter tip for spine or paraspinous diagnostic or therapeutic injection procedures (epidural or subarachnoid)) 79 percent of the time in the nonfacility setting in CY 2013. CPT code 62319, which is the epidural injection code that is least frequently billed with CPT code 77003 in the nonfacility setting, was still billed with this guidance code 40 percent of the time. These codes were also frequently billed with image guidance in the facility setting. CPT codes 62310 and 62311 were billed with CPT code 77003, 79 percent and 74 percent of the time, respectively in CY 2013. However, in the facility setting CPT codes 62318 and 62319 were much less frequently billed with CPT code 77003, only 3 percent and 11 percent, respectively. In addition, these four epidural injection codes are sometimes billed with other fluoroscopic or imaging guidance codes. Based on the frequency with which these codes are reported with fluoroscopic guidance codes, it appears that fluoroscopic guidance is both typically used and typically reported separately in conjunction with the epidural injection services., 473294=Since payment for anesthesia services under the PFS is based upon a separate fee schedule, routine updates must be calculated in a different way than those for services for which payment is calculated based upon work, PE and MP RVUs. To apply certain updates to the anesthesia fee schedule, we usually develop proxy RVUs for individual anesthesia services. However, because work RVUs are integral to the MP RVU methodology and anesthesia services do not have work RVUs, the MP update process for anesthesia services is more complex than for services with work RVUs and clinical labor inputs. Notwithstanding these challenges, we believe that payment rates for anesthesia should reflect relative MP resource costs, including updates to reflect changes over time, as do other PFS payment rates. We are not proposing to include such an adjustment at this time because we believe it would be helpful to receive input from stakeholders on how we could address these challenges and develop a proposal to appropriately update the MP resource costs for anesthesia through future rulemaking. Therefore, we intend to propose an anesthesia adjustment for MP in the CY 2016 PFS proposed rule and are seeking comment in this rule about how to best do so., 245759=Finally, we note that the RUC recommendation also indicated that given the labor-intensive nature of reviewing all clinical labor tasks associated with film technology, these times would be addressed as these codes are reviewed. We agree with the RUC that reviewing and adjusting the times for each code would be difficult and labor-intensive since the direct PE input database does not allow for a comprehensive adjustment of the clinical labor time based on changes in particular clinical labor tasks. To make broad adjustments such as this across codes, the PE database would need to contain the time associated with individual clinical labor tasks rather than reflecting only the sum of times for the pre-service period, service period, and post-service period, as it does now. We recognize this situation presents a challenge in implementing RUC recommendations such as this one, and makes it difficult to understand the basis of both the RUC's recommended clinical labor times and our refinements of those recommendations. Therefore, we are considering revising the direct PE input database to include task-level clinical labor time information for every code in the database. As an example, we refer readers to the supporting data files for the direct PE inputs, which include public use files that display clinical labor times as allocated to each individual clinical labor task for a sample of procedures. We are displaying this information as we attempt to increase the transparency of the direct PE database. We hope that this modification could enable us to more accurately allocate equipment minutes to clinical labor tasks in a more consistent and efficient manner. Given the number of procedures and the volume of information involved, we are seeking comments on the feasibility of this approach. We note that we are not proposing to make any changes to PE inputs for CY 2015 based on this proposed modification to the design of the direct PE input database., 737634=Under section 10331(f) of the Affordable Care Act, we are required to submit a report to the Congress by January 1, 2015, on Physician Compare development, and include information on the efforts and plans to collect and publish data on physician quality and efficiency and on patient experience of care in support of value-based purchasing and consumer choice. Section 10331(g) of the Affordable Care Act provides that any time before that date, we may continue to expand the information made available on Physician Compare., 796594=To establish the minimum number of measures (9 measures covering at least 3 NQS domains) a QCDR may report for the PQRS, we placed a limit on the number of non-PQRS measures (20) that a QCDR may submit on behalf of an eligible professional at this time (78 FR 74476). Although we believe such a limit is still necessary because the QCDR option is still new and we are still gaining familiarity with the measures available for reporting under the QCDRs, we believe it is appropriate to increase the number of non-PQRS that may be reported by QCDRs. We have received comments from entities currently undergoing the QCDR qualification process who wish to submit data on additional measures and we believe that accepting additional quality measures data is important, as it provides a better and more complete picture of the quality of care provided by eligible professionals. Therefore, we are proposing to change this limit from 20 measures to 30. In other words, beginning with the criteria for satisfactory participation for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, a QCDR may submit quality measures data for a maximum of 30 non-PQRS measures. Please note that this proposed limit does not apply to measures contained in the PQRS measure set, as QCDRs can report on as many measures in the PQRS measure set as they wish., 387142=In the CY 2013 proposed rule, we sought comments on methods of obtaining accurate and current data on E/M services furnished as part of a global surgical package. In addition to receiving the broader comments on measuring post-operative work, we also received a comment from the RUC saying that the hospital inpatient and discharge day management services included in the global period for many surgical procedures were inadvertently removed from the time file in 2007. With its comment letter, the RUC sent us a data file with updated times for these post-operative visits for some services that displayed zero hospital inpatient or discharge day visits in the CMS time file. After extensive review, we concluded that the data were deleted from the time file due to an inadvertent error as noted by the RUC. Therefore, during CY 2014 PFS rulemaking we finalized a proposal to replace the missing postoperative hospital inpatient and discharge day visits for the more than 100 codes that were identified by the RUC., 560692=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we finalized a policy to pay separately for care management services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries with two or more chronic conditions beginning in CY 2015 (78 FR 74414)., 748447=As part of our public reporting plan for Physician Compare, in the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period (77 FR 69166-69167), we also finalized the decision to publicly report Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CG-CAHPS) data for group practices of 100 or more eligible professionals reporting data in 2013 under the GPRO and for ACOs participating in the Shared Savings Program, if technically feasible. We anticipate posting these data on Physician Compare in late 2014, if available., 280844=To understand how this trend is affecting Medicare, including the accuracy of payments made through the PFS, we need to develop data to assess the extent to which this shift toward hospital-based physician practices is occurring. To that end, during CY 2014 rulemaking we sought comment regarding the best method for collecting information that would allow us to analyze the frequency, type, and payment for services furnished in off-campus provider-based hospital departments (73 FR 43302). We received many thoughtful comments. However, the commenters did not present a consensus opinion regarding the options we presented in last year's rule. Based on our analysis of the comments, we believe the most efficient and equitable means of gathering this important information across two different payment systems would be to create a HCPCS modifier to be reported with every code for physician and hospital services furnished in an off-campus provider-based department of a hospital. The modifier would be reported on both the CMS-1500 claim form for physicians' services and the UB-04 (CMS form 1450) for hospital outpatient claims. (We note that the requirements for a determination that a facility or an organization has provider-based status are specified in \u00a7 413.65 and we define a hospital campus to be the physical area immediately adjacent to the provider's main buildings, other areas and structures that are not strictly contiguous to the main buildings but are located within 250 yards of the main buildings, and any other areas determined on an individual case basis, by the CMS regional office.), 167568=In addition, section 220 of the PAMA includes other provisions regarding valuation of services under the PFS that take effect in future years. Section 220(d) of the PAMA establishes an annual target from CY 2017 through CY 2020 for reductions in PFS expenditures resulting from adjustments to relative values of misvalued services. The target is calculated as 0.5 percent of the estimated amount of expenditures under the fee schedule for the year. If the net reduction in expenditures for the year is equal to or greater than the target for the year, the funds shall be redistributed in a budget-neutral manner within the PFS. The amount by which such reduced expenditures exceed the target for the year shall be treated as a reduction in expenditures for the subsequent year, for purposes of determining whether the target has or has not been met. The legislation includes an exemption from budget neutrality if the target is not met. Other provisions of section 220 of the PAMA include a 2-year phase-in for reductions in RVUs of at least 20 percent for potentially misvalued codes that do not involve coding changes and certain adjustments to the fee schedule areas in California. These provisions will be addressed as we implement them in future rulemaking., 140658=The PFS Addenda along with other supporting documents and tables referenced in this proposed rule are available through the Internet on the CMS Web site at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/PFS-Federal-Regulation-Notices.html. Click on the link on the left side of the screen titled, \u201cPFS Federal Regulations Notices\u201d for a chronological list of PFS Federal Register and other related documents. For the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule, refer to item CMS-1612-P. Readers who experience any problems accessing any of the Addenda or other documents referenced in this proposed rule and posted on the CMS Web site identified above should contact Larry.Chan@cms.hhs.gov., 580070=After gathering input from stakeholders, we believe that requiring those who furnish CCM services to utilize electronic health record technology that has been certified by a certifying body authorized by the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology will ensure that practitioners have adequate capabilities to allow members of the interdisciplinary care team to have immediate access to the most updated information informing the care plan. Furthermore, we believe that requiring those that furnish CCM services to maintain and share an electronic care plan will alleviate the development of duplicative care plans or updates and the associated errors that can occur when care plans are not systematically reconciled. To ensure that practices offering CCM services meet these needs, we are proposing a new scope of service requirement for electronic care planning capabilities and electronic health records. Specifically, we are proposing that CCM services must be furnished with the use of an electronic health record or other health IT or health information exchange platform that includes an electronic care plan that is accessible to all providers within the practice, including being accessible to those who are furnishing care outside of normal business hours, and that is available to be shared electronically with care team members outside of the practice. To ensure all practices have adequate capabilities to meet electronic health record requirements, the practitioner must utilize EHR technology certified by a certifying body authorized by the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to an edition of the electronic health record certification criteria identified in the then-applicable version of 45 CFR part 170. At a minimum, the practice must utilize EHR technology that meets the certification criteria adopted at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(3), 170.314(a)(4), 170.314(a)(5), 170.314(a)(6), 170.314(a)(7) and 170.314(e)(2) pertaining to the capture of demographics, problem lists, medications, and other key elements related to the ultimate creation of an electronic summary care record. For example, practitioners furnishing CCM services beginning in CY 2015 would be required to utilize an electronic health record certified to at least those 2014 Edition certification criteria. Given these certification criteria, EHR technology would be certified to capture data and ultimately produce summary records according to the HL7 Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture standard (see 45 CFR 170.205(a)(3)). When any of the CCM scope of service requirements include a reference to a health or medical record, a system meeting these requirements is required., 764438=We would analyze the component measures that make up each of these measure groups to see if a statistically viable composite can be constructed with the data reported for 2015. We have received ample feedback from stakeholders indicating such scores are strongly desired. Composite scores, generally, have also proven to be critical for providing consumers a better way to understand quality measure data as composites provide a more concise, easy to understand picture of physician quality. Therefore, we plan to analyze the data once collected to establish the best possible composite, which would help consumers use these quality data to make informed health care decisions., 162890=The Pathway for SGR Reform Act extended through March 31, 2014 several provisions of Medicare law that would have otherwise expired on December 31, 2013. The PAMA extended these same provisions further through March 31, 2015. A list of these provisions follows., 185737=For a more detailed description of the PE RVU methodology, we refer readers to the CY 2010 PFS final rule with comment period (74 FR 61745 through 61746)., 161807=The Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 (Pub. L. 113-67, enacted on December 26, 2013) established a 0.5 percent update to the PFS CF through March 31, 2014 and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-93, enacted on April 1, 2014) (PAMA) extended this 0.5 percent update through December 31, 2014. As a result, the CF for CY 2014 that was published in the CY 2014 final rule with comment period (78 FR 74230) was revised to $35.8228 for services furnished on or after January 1, 2014 and on or before December 31, 2014. The PAMA provides for a 0.0 percent update to the PFS for services furnished on or after January 1, 2015 and on or before March 31, 2015., 178585=Previously, we established PE/HR values for various specialties without SMS or supplemental survey data by crosswalking them to other similar specialties to estimate a proxy PE/HR. For specialties that were part of the PPIS for which we previously used a crosswalked PE/HR, we instead used the PPIS-based PE/HR. We continue previous crosswalks for specialties that did not participate in the PPIS. However, beginning in CY 2010 we changed the PE/HR crosswalk for portable x-ray suppliers from radiology to IDTF, a more appropriate crosswalk because these specialties are more similar to each other with respect to work time., 781561=The proposed requirements will primarily focus on our proposals related to the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, which will be based on an eligible professional's or a group practice's reporting of quality measures data during the 12-month calendar year reporting period occurring in 2015 (that is, January 1 through December 31, 2015). Please note that, in developing these proposals, we focused on aligning our requirements with other quality reporting programs, such as the Medicare EHR Incentive Program for Eligible Professionals, the Physician Value-Based Payment Modifier (VM), and the Medicare Shared Savings Program, where and to the extent appropriate and feasible. In previous years, we have made various strides in our ongoing efforts to align the reporting requirements in CMS' various quality reporting programs to reduce burden on the eligible professionals and group practices that participate in these programs. Particularly through the QCDR option, we are exploring opportunities to align with quality reporting programs that exist outside of CMS where and to the extent appropriate and feasible. We continued to focus on alignment as we developed our proposals for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment below., 751211=We also finalized publicly reporting patient experience survey-based measures from the CG-CAHPS measures for groups of 100 or more eligible professionals who participate in PQRS GPRO, regardless of GPRO submission method, and for Shared Savings Program ACOs reporting through the GPRO web interface or other CMS-approved tool or interface (78 FR 74452). For 2014 data, we finalized publicly reporting data for the 12 summary survey measures also finalized for groups of 25 to 99 for PQRS reporting requirements (78 FR 74452). These summary survey measures would be available for public reporting 100 or more EPs participating in PQRS GPRO as well as group practices of 25 to 99 EPs when collected via any certified CAHPS vendor regardless of PQRS participation, as technically feasible. For ACOs participating in the Shared Savings Program, the patient experience measures that are included in the Patient/Caregiver Experience domain of the Quality Performance Standard under the Shared Savings Program (78 FR 74452) are available for public reporting in 2015., 797990=Additionally, CMS' experience during the 2014 self-nomination process shed light on clarifications needed on what is considered a non-PQRS measure. Therefore, to clarify the definition of non-PQRS measures, we propose the following parameters for a measure to be considered a non-PQRS measure:, 1005730=Since finalizing this proposal, we have received feedback from stakeholders regarding the difficulty and expense of having to test and recertify CEHRT products to the most recent version of the electronic specifications for the CQMs. While we still believe EPs should test and certify their products to the most recent version of the electronic specifications for the CQMs when feasible, we understand the burdens associated with this requirement. Therefore, to eliminate this added burden, we are proposing that, beginning in CY 2015, EPs would not be required to ensure that their CEHRT products are recertified to the most recent version of the electronic specifications for the CQMs. Please note that, although we are not requiring recertification, EPs must still report the most recent version of the electronic specifications for the CQMs., 485717=Using aggregate territory-level BLS OES wage data results in a \u22122.3 percent decrease in the work GPCI, a \u22124.48 percent decrease in the PE GPCI, and a \u22123.2 percent decrease to the GAF for the Virgin Islands payment locality. However, with the application of the 1.0 work GPCI floor, there is no change to the work GPCI and the overall impact of using actual BLS OES wage data on the Virgin Islands payment locality is only reflected by the change in PE GPCI (\u22124.48 percent) resulting in a \u22122.00 percent decrease to the GAF. As mentioned previously in this section, since we have not been able to obtain malpractice premium data for the Virgin Islands payment locality we maintained the MP GPCI at 1.0. As such, there is no change in the MP GPCI. We propose to use aggregate BLS OES wage data to calculate the work GPCI and employee wage component of the PE GPCI for the Virgin Islands payment locality beginning for CY 2015, and for future GPCI updates. We are specifically requesting public comments on this proposal. Additional information on our proposal to calculate GPCI values for the Virgin Islands payment locality may be found in our contractor's report, \u201cRevised Final Report on the CY 2014 Update of the Geographic Practice Cost Index for the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule,\u201d which is available on the CMS Web site. It is located under the supporting documents section of the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule located at http://www.cms.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/., 996539=Finally, in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we stated that a QCDR must provide to CMS descriptions and narrative specifications for the measures for which it will report to CMS by no later than March 31, 2014. In keeping with this timeframe, we propose that a QCDR must provide to CMS descriptions for the measures for which it will report to CMS for a particular year by no later than March 31 of the applicable reporting period for which the QCDR wishes to submit quality measures data. For example, if a QCDR wishes to submit quality measures data for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment (the 12-month reporting period of which occurs in 2015), the QCDR must provide to CMS descriptions for the measures for which it will report to CMS by no later than March 31, 2015. The descriptions must include: name/title of measures, NQF # (if NQF endorsed), descriptions of the denominator, numerator, and when applicable, denominator exceptions and denominator exclusions of the measure. The narrative specifications provided must be similar to the narrative specifications we provide in our measures list, available at http://www.cms.gov/apps/ama/license.asp?file=/PQRS/downloads/2014_PQRS_IndClaimsRegistry_MeasureSpecs_SupportingDocs_12132013.zip., 116373=In commenting, please refer to file code CMS-1612-P. Because of staff and resource limitations, we cannot accept comments by facsimile (FAX) transmission., 471166=The proposed resource-based MP RVUs are shown in Addendum B, which is available on the CMS Web site under the supporting documents section of the CY 2015 PFS rule at http://www.cms.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/. These values have been adjusted for budget neutrality on the basis of the most recent 2013 utilization data available. We will make a final budget neutrality adjustment in the final rule on the basis of the available 2013 utilization data at that time. We do not believe, however, that the final values will change significantly from the proposed values as a result of the final budget-neutrality adjustment., 375803=To address the issues discussed above, we are proposing to retain global bundles for surgical services, but to refine bundles by transitioning over several years all 10- and 90-day global codes to 0-day global codes. Medically reasonable and necessary visits would be billed separately during the pre- and post-operative periods outside of the day of the surgical procedure. We propose to make this transition for current 10-day global codes in CY 2017 and for the current 90-day global codes in CY 2018, pending the availability of data on which to base updated values for the global codes., 135080=MMAMedicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108-173, enacted on December 8, 2003), 804197=Based on CMS experience with the qualifying entities wishing to become QCDRs for reporting periods occurring in 2014, we received feedback from many organizations who expressed concern that the entity wishing to become a QCDR may not meet the requirements of a QCDR solely on its own. Therefore, we provide the following proposals beginning in 2015 on situations where an entity may not meet the requirements of a QCDR solely on its own but, in conjunction with another entity, may be able to meet the requirements of a QCDR and therefore be eligible for qualification:, 632036=The 2010 Primary RUCA codes are as follows:, 990804=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we finalized the CG-CAHPS survey available for reporting under the PQRS for 2014 and beyond (78 FR 74750 through 74751), to which we are now referring as the CAHPS for PQRS. Please note that, in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we classified the CAHPS for PQRS survey under the care coordination and communication NQS domain. We note that this was an error on our part, as the CAHPS for PQRS survey has typically been classified under the Person and Caregiver-Centered Experience and Outcomes domain as the CAHPS for PQRS survey assesses beneficiary experience of care and outcomes. Therefore, as we indicate in Table 21, we are proposing to reclassify the CAHPS for PQRS survey under the Person and Caregiver-Centered Experience and Outcomes domain. We invite public comment on this proposal., 526712=We received comments on the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period suggesting that the existing process for review and adoption of interim final values for new, revised, and misvalued codes violates section 1871(a)(2) of the Act, which prescribes the rulemaking requirements for the agency in establishing payment rates. In response to those commenters, we note that the process we use to establish interim final rates is in full accordance with the statute and we do not find this a persuasive reason to consider modifying the process that we use to establish PFS rates., 848740=In addition, if a group practice does not report on at least 1 cross-cutting measure and the group practice has at least 1 eligible professional who sees at least 1 Medicare patient in a face-to-face encounter, the MAV will also allow us to determine whether a group practice should have reported on any of the proposed cross-cutting measures specified in Table 21. The MAV process we are proposing to implement for registry reporting is the same process that was established for reporting periods occurring in 2014 for the 2014 PQRS incentive. For more information on the registry MAV process, please visit http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/PQRS/Downloads/2014_PQRS_Registry_MeasureApplicabilityValidation_12132013.zip., 629609=In addition to the OMB's statistical area delineations, the current geographic areas used in the ambulance fee schedule also are based on the most recent version of the Goldsmith Modification. Section 1834(l) of the Act requires that we use the most recent version of the Goldsmith Modification to determine rural census tracts within MSAs. These rural census tracts are considered rural areas under the ambulance fee schedule (see \u00a7 414.605). In the CY 2007 PFS final rule (71 FR 69714 through 69716), we adopted the most recent (at that time) version of the Goldsmith Modification, designated as Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes. RUCA codes use urbanization, population density, and daily commuting data to categorize every census tract in the country. For a discussion about RUCA codes, we refer the reader to the CY 2007 PFS final rule (71 FR 69714 through 69716). As stated previously, on February 28, 2013, OMB issued OMB Bulletin No. 13-01, which established revised delineations for Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined Statistical Areas, and provided guidance on the use of the delineations of these statistical areas. Several modifications of the RUCA codes were necessary to take into account updated commuting data and the revised OMB delineations. We refer readers to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service Web site for a detailed listing of updated RUCA codes found at http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes.aspx. The updated RUCA code definitions were introduced in late 2013 and are based on data from the 2010 decennial census and the 2006-10 American Community Survey. We are proposing to adopt the most recent modifications of the RUCA codes beginning in CY 2015, to recognize levels of rurality in census tracts located in every county across the nation, for purposes of payment under the ambulance fee schedule. If we adopt the most recent RUCA codes, many counties that are designated as urban at the county level based on population would have rural census tracts within them that would be recognized as rural areas through our use of RUCA codes., 565909=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (75 FR 74425 through 74427), we discussed how the policies relating to services furnished incident to a practitioner's professional services apply to CCM services. (In this discussion, the term practitioner means both physicians and NPPs who are permitted to bill for services furnished incident to their own professional services.) Specifically, we addressed the policy for counting clinical staff time for services furnished incident to the billing practitioner's services toward the minimum amount of service time required to bill for CCM services., 532905=As we noted in the CY 2012 PFS final rule with comment period, the RUC recommendations are an essential element that we consider when valuing codes. Likewise, we recognize the significant contribution that the CPT Editorial Panel makes to the success of the potentially misvalued code initiative through its consideration and adoption of coding changes. Although we have increased our scrutiny of the RUC recommendations in recent years and accepted fewer of the recommendations without making our own refinements, the CPT codes and the RUC recommendations continue to play a major role in our valuations. For many codes, the surveys conducted by specialty societies as part of the RUC process are the best data that we have regarding the time and intensity of work. The RUC determines the criteria and the methodology for those surveys. It also reviews the survey results. This process allows for development of survey data that are more reliable and comparable across specialties and services than would be possible without having the RUC at the center of the survey vetting process. In addition, the debate and discussion of the services at the RUC meetings in which CMS staff participate provides a good understanding of what the service entails and how it compares to other services in the family, and to services furnished by other specialties. The debate among the specialties is also an important part of this process. Although we increasingly consider data and information from many other sources, and we intend to expand the scope of those data and sources, the RUC recommendations remain a vital part of our valuation process., 255714=Subsequent to the publication of the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, it came to our attention that, due to a clerical error, the clinical labor type for CPT code 77293 (Respiratory Motion Management Simulation (list separately in addition to code for primary procedure)) was entered as L052A (Audiologist) instead of L152A (Medical Physicist), which has a higher cost per minute. We are proposing a correction to the clinical labor type for this service., 742927=We continue to implement our plan for a phased approach to public reporting performance information on Physician Compare. The first phase of this plan was finalized with the CY 2012 PFS final rule with comment period (76 FR 73419-73420), where we established that PQRS GPRO measures collected through the GPRO web interface for 2012 would be publicly reported on Physician Compare. The plan was expanded with the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period (77 FR 69166), where we established that the specific GPRO web interface measures that would be posted on Physician Compare would include the PQRS GPRO measures for Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and we noted that we would report composite measures for these measure groups in 2014, if technically feasible. [5] The 2012 PQRS GPRO measures were publicly reported on Physician Compare in February 2014. Data reported in 2013 on the GPRO DM and GPRO CAD measures and composites collected via the GPRO web interface that meet the minimum sample size of 20 patients and prove to be statistically valid and reliable will be publicly reported on Physician Compare in late CY 2014, if technically feasible. If the minimum threshold is not met for a particular measure, or the measure is otherwise deemed not to be suitable for public reporting, the group's performance rate on that measure will not be publicly reported. We will only publish on Physician Compare those measures that are statistically valid and reliable and therefore most likely to help consumers make informed decisions about the Medicare professionals they choose to meet their health care needs., 722325=In the February 8, 2013 final rule, many commenters recommended that accredited or certified continuing education payments to speakers should not be reported because there are safeguards already in place, and they are not direct payments to a covered recipient. In the final rule preamble, we noted that \u201cindustry support for accredited or certified continuing education is a unique relationship\u201d (78 FR 9492). Section 403.904(g)(1) states that payments or other transfers of value provided as compensation for speaking at a continuing education program need not be reported if the following three conditions are met:, 360967=Following that report, the OIG continued to investigate E/M services furnished during global surgical periods. In May 2012, the OIG published a report entitled \u201cMusculoskeletal Global Surgery Fees Often Did Not Reflect the Number of Evaluation and Management Services Provided\u201d (A-05-09-00053). For this investigation, the OIG sampled 300 musculoskeletal global surgeries and again found that, for the majority of sampled surgeries, physicians furnished fewer E/M services than were included as part of the global period payment for that service. Once again, a small percentage of surgeons furnished more E/M services than were included in the global surgical package payment. The OIG concluded that the RVUs for these global surgical packages are too high because they include a higher number of E/M services than typically are furnished within the global period for the reviewed procedures., 769969=We propose that these 12 summary survey measures would be available for public reporting for all group practices. For ACOs participating in the Shared Savings Program, we propose that the patient experience measures that are included in the Patient/Caregiver Experience domain of the Quality Performance Standard under the Shared Savings Program in 2015 would be available for public reporting in 2016. We would review all quality measures after they are collected to ensure that only those measures deemed valid and reliable are included on the Web site., 799844=Furthermore, under our authority to establish the requirements for an entity to be considered a QCDR under section 1848(m)(3)(E)(i) of the Act, we established certain requirements for an entity to be considered a QCDR in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74467 through 74473). Under this same authority, we are proposing here to add the following requirement that an entity must meet to serve as a QCDR under the PQRS for reporting periods beginning in 2015:, 482030=For CY 2015, we explored using the available data from the Virgin Islands to more accurately reflect the geographic cost differences for the Virgin Islands payment locality as compared to other PFS localities. Although county level data for the Virgin Islands are not represented in the BLS OES wage data, aggregate territory level BLS OES wage data are available. We believe that using aggregate territory level data is a better reflection of the relative cost differences of operating a medical practice in the Virgin Islands payment locality as compared to other PFS localities than the current approach of assigning a value of 1.0. At our request, our contractor calculated the work GPCI, and the employee wage component and purchased services component of the PE GPCI, for the Virgin Islands payment locality using aggregated 2009 through 2011 BLS OES data., 821456=In the CY 2013 PFS final rule with comment period, we finalized the following criterion for the satisfactory reporting for individual eligible professionals to report measures groups via registry for the 2014 PQRS incentive: For the 12-month reporting period for the 2014 PQRS incentive, report at least 1 measures group AND report each measures group for at least 20 patients, the majority (11 patients) of which must be Medicare Part B FFS patients. Measures groups containing a measure with a 0 percent performance rate will not be counted (see Table 47 at 78 FR 74479)., 149926=Initially, only the work RVUs were resource-based, and the PE and MP RVUs were based on average allowable charges. Section 121 of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1994 (103, enacted on October 31, 1994), amended section 1848(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act and required us to develop resource-based PE RVUs for each physicians' service beginning in 1998. We were required to consider general categories of expenses (such as office rent and wages of personnel, but excluding malpractice expenses) comprising PEs. The PE RVUs continue to represent the portion of these resources involved in furnishing PFS services., 824156=Section 1848(a)(8) of the Act provides that for covered professional services furnished by an eligible professional during 2015 or any subsequent year, if the eligible professional does not satisfactorily report data on quality measures for covered professional services for the quality reporting period for the year, the fee schedule amount for services furnished by such professional during the year shall be equal to the applicable percent of the fee schedule amount that would otherwise apply to such services. For 2016 and subsequent years, the applicable percent is 98.0 percent., 417464=Section 1848(c) of the Act requires that each service paid under the PFS be comprised of three components: Work; PE; and malpractice (MP) expense. As required by section 1848(c) of the Act, beginning in CY 2000, MP RVUs are resource based. Malpractice RVUs for new codes after 1991 were extrapolated from similar existing codes or as a percentage of the corresponding work RVU. Section 1848(c)(2)(B)(i) of the Act also requires that we review, and if necessary adjust, RVUs no less often than every 5 years. For CY 2015, we are proposing to implement the third comprehensive review and update of MP RVUs. For details about prior updates, see the CY 2010 final rule with comment period (74 FR 33537)., 775629=Finally, we propose to make available on Physician Compare, 2015 Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR) measure data collected at the individual level or aggregated to a higher level of the QCDR's choosing\u2014such as the group practice level, if technically feasible. QCDRs are able to collect both PQRS measures and non-PQRS measures. [9] We believe that making QCDR data available on Physician Compare further supports the expansion of quality measure data available for EPs and group practices regardless of specialty therefore providing more quality data to consumers to help them make informed decisions. The QCDR would be required to declare during their self-nomination if they plan to post data on their own Web site and allow Physician Compare to link to it or if they will provide data to us for public reporting on Physician Compare. We propose that measures collected via QCDRs must also meet the established public reporting criteria, including a 20 patient minimum sample size. As with PQRS data, we propose to publicly report all measures submitted and reviewed and deemed valid and reliable in the Physician Compare downloadable file. However, not all of these measures necessarily would be included on the Physician Compare profile pages. Our analysis of the measure data once collected, consumer testing, and stakeholder feedback would determine specifically which measures are published on profile pages on the Web site., 321134=We received thousands of comments objecting to the CY 2014 interim final values for these codes, many citing concerns with patient access and with the potential for the payment reductions under the PFS to inappropriately incentivize the use of the hospital setting or to encourage the use of other injections. Some suggested these payment rates might affect the rate of opioid use. Although most comments did not address the accuracy of the relative value inputs used in determining PFS payment rates, those that did most often objected to our valuations of the work RVUs and recommended that we instead accept the RUC recommendations. Several commenters objected to our rationale for setting the interim final work RVUs lower than the RUC-recommended values primarily based upon the reduction in time. Commenters gave two primary reasons why this reduction was inappropriate. Some pointed out that a reduction in work based upon a reduction in time presumes that the existing time is correct. These commenters asserted that the existing times were not correct for these codes. For example, the RUC noted that the CY 2013 survey times were from the original 1999 survey and were an outlier when compared to the previously reported code's original Harvard-valued total time of 42 minutes. One commenter noted that CMS indicates that in setting work values, the agency considers time, mental effort, professional judgment, technical skill, physical effort and stress due to risk; but in this case, rather than following our process, we only considered time. Others also said that we did not take into account the intensity, complexity, or risk of performing epidural injections. Commenters disagreed with the use of the lowest RUC survey value as the basis for the work valuation. One commenter said that we failed to explain adequately why our work RVUs were below those recommended by the RUC. One recommended that we assign values more similar to those used for paravertebral injections., 282539=Therefore, we are proposing to collect this information on the type and frequency of services furnished in off-campus provider-based departments in accordance with our authority under section 1834(c)(2)(M) of the Act (as added by section 220(a) of the PAMA) beginning January 1, 2015. The collection of this information would allow us to begin to assess the accuracy of the PE data, including both the service-level direct PE inputs and the specialty-level indirect PE information that we currently use to value PFS services. Furthermore, this information would be critical in order to develop proposed improvements to our PE data or methodology that would appropriately account for the different resource costs among traditional office, facility, and off-campus provider-based settings. We are seeking additional comment on whether a code modifier is the best mechanism for collecting this service-level information., 564126=For direct PE inputs, we are proposing 20 minutes of clinical labor time. As established in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, in order to bill for this code, at least 20 minutes of CCM services must be furnished during the 30-day billing interval (78 FR 74422). Based upon input from stakeholders and the nature of care management services, we believe that many aspects of this service will be provided by clinical staff, and thus, clinical staff will be involved in the typical service for the full 20 minutes. The proposed CY 2015 direct PE input database reflects this input and is available on the CMS Web site under the supporting data files for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/PFS-Federal-Regulation-Notices.html. The proposed PE RVUs included in Addendum B to this proposed rule reflect the RVUs that result from using these inputs to establish PE RVUs., 594446=Our proposal to revise the definition of \u201ccolorectal cancer screening tests\u201d in this manner would further reduce our beneficiaries' cost-sharing obligations under Part B. Screening colonoscopies have been recommended with a grade of A by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and \u00a7 410.152(l)(5) provides that Medicare Part B pays 100 percent of the Medicare payment amount established under the PFS for colorectal cancer screening tests except for barium enemas (which do not have a grade A or B recommendation from the USPSTF). This regulation is based on section 4104 of the Affordable Care Act, which amended section 1833(a)(1) of the Act to require 100 percent Medicare payment of the fee schedule amount for those \u201cpreventive services\u201d that are appropriate for the individual and are recommended with a grade of A or B by the USPSTF. Section 4104 effectively waives any Part B coinsurance that would otherwise apply under section 1833(a)(1) of the Act for certain recommended preventive services, including screening colonoscopies. For additional discussion of the impact of section 4104 of the Affordable Care Act, and our prior rulemaking based on this provision see the CY 2011 PFS final rule with comment period (75 FR 73412 through 73431). We also note that under \u00a7 410.160(b)(7) colorectal cancer screening tests are not subject to the Part B annual deductible and do not count toward meeting that deductible., 494170=Effective January 1, 2014, we also changed our policy so that geographic eligibility for an originating site would be established and maintained on an annual basis, consistent with other telehealth payment policies (78 FR 74400). Geographic eligibility for Medicare telehealth originating sites for each calendar year is now based upon the status of the area as of December 31 of the prior calendar year., 827957=Unlike the satisfactory participation criteria that were established for the 2014 PQRS incentive, we are proposing to modify \u00a7 414.90(k)(4) to require that an eligible professional report on not only 1 but at least 3 outcome measures (or, 2 outcome measures and at least 1 resource use, patient experience of care, or efficiency/appropriate use if 3 outcomes measures are not available). We are proposing this increase because it is our goal to, when appropriate, move towards the reporting of more outcome measures. We believe the reporting of outcome measures (for example, unplanned hospital readmission after a procedure) better captures the quality of care an eligible professional provides than, for example, process measures (for example, whether a Hemoglobin A1c test was performed for diabetic patients). In establishing this proposal, we understand that a QCDR may not have 3 outcomes measures within its quality measure data set. Therefore, as an alternative to a third outcome measure, we are allowing an eligible professional to report on at least 1 resource use, patient experience of care, or efficiency/appropriate use measure in lieu of an outcome measure., 1008528=In the EHR Incentive Program Stage 2 final rule, we established CQM reporting options for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program for CY 2014 and subsequent years that include one individual reporting option that aligns with the PQRS's EHR reporting option (77 FR 54058) and two group reporting options that align with the PQRS GPRO and Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and Pioneer ACOs (77 FR 54076 to 54078). In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we finalized two additional aligned options for EPs to report CQMs for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program for CY 2014 and subsequent years with the intention of minimizing the reporting burden on EPs (78 FR 74753 through 74757). One of the aligned options finalized in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74754 through 74755) is a reporting option for CQMs for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program under which EPs can submit CQM information using qualified clinical data registries, according the definition and requirements for qualified clinical data registries established under the PQRS., 551263=As discussed in the 1993 PFS final rule with comment period (57 FR 55938), we adopted a refinement panel process to assist us in reviewing the public comments on CPT codes with interim final work RVUs for a year and in developing final work values for the subsequent year. We decided the panel would be comprised of a multispecialty group of physicians who would review and discuss the work involved in each procedure under review, and then each panel member would individually rate the work of the procedure. We believed establishing the panel with a multispecialty group would balance the interests of the specialty societies who commented on the work RVUs with the budgetary and redistributive effects that could occur if we accepted extensive increases in work RVUs across a broad range of services., 842109=As with individual reporting, we understand that there may be instances where a group practice may not have at least 9 measures applicable to a group practice's practice. In this instance, like the criterion we finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive (see Table 49 at 78 FR 74486), a group practice reporting on less than 9 measures would still be able to meet the satisfactory reporting criterion via registry if the group practice reports on as many measures as are applicable to the group practice's practice. If a group practice reports on less than 9 measures, the group practice would be subject to the MAV process, which would allow us to determine whether a group practice should have reported quality data codes for additional measures and/or measures covering additional NQS domains. In addition, if a group practice does not report on at least 1 cross-cutting measure and the group practice has at least 1 eligible professional who sees at least 1 Medicare patient in a face-to-face encounter, the MAV will also allow us to determine whether a group practice should have reported on any of the proposed cross-cutting measures specified in Table 21. The MAV process we are proposing to implement for registry reporting is the same process that was established for reporting periods occurring in 2014 for the 2014 PQRS incentive. For more information on the registry MAV process, please visit http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/PQRS/Downloads/2014_PQRS_Registry_MeasureApplicabilityValidation_12132013.zip., 120184=Kathy Kersell, (410) 786-2033, for issues related to direct practice expense inputs., 168876=On March 5, 2014, we submitted to MedPAC an estimate of the SGR and CF applicable to Medicare payments for physicians' services for CY 2015, as required by section 1848(d)(1)(E) of the Act. The actual values used to compute physician payments for CY 2015 will be based on later data and are scheduled to be published by November 1, 2014, as part of the CY 2015 PFS final rule with comment period., 500960=We received several requests in CY 2013 to add various services as Medicare telehealth services effective for CY 2015. The following presents a discussion of these requests, and our proposals for additions to the CY 2015 telehealth list. Of the requests received, we find that the following services are sufficiently similar to psychiatric diagnostic procedures or office/outpatient visits currently on the telehealth list to qualify on a category one basis. Therefore, we propose to add the following services to the telehealth list on a category 1 basis for CY 2015:, 172763=Practice expense (PE) is the portion of the resources used in furnishing a service that reflects the general categories of physician and practitioner expenses, such as office rent and personnel wages, but excluding MP expenses, as specified in section 1848(c)(1)(B) of the Act. As required by section 1848(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, we use a resource-based system for determining PE RVUs for each physician's service. We develop PE RVUs by considering the direct and indirect practice resources involved in furnishing each service. Direct expense categories include clinical labor, medical supplies, and medical equipment. Indirect expenses include administrative labor, office expense, and all other expenses. The sections that follow provide more detailed information about the methodology for translating the resources involved in furnishing each service into service-specific PE RVUs. We refer readers to the CY 2010 PFS final rule with comment period (74 FR 61743 through 61748) for a more detailed explanation of the PE methodology., 987013=We finalized the measures that are available for reporting in the GPRO Web interface for 2014 and beyond in the CY 2013 PFS final rule (77 FR 69269). However, we are proposing to remove and add measures in the GPRO Web interface measure set as reflected in Tables 47 and 48 for 2015 and beyond. Specifically, Table 47 specifies the measures we are proposing to remove for reporting from the GPRO Web interface, and Table 48 specifies the measures we are proposing to add for reporting in the GPRO Web interface. CMS is proposing to adopt Depression Remission at Twelve Months (NQF #0710) in the 2015 GPRO Web Interface reporting option for ACOs and group practices. This measure is currently reportable in the PQRS program through the EHR reporting option only and has not been tested using claims level data or sampling methodology. Depression Remission at Twelve Months (NQF #0710) requires a look-back period and a look-forward period possibly spanning multiple calendar years. Additionally, this measure requires utilization of a PHQ-9 depression screening tool with a score greater than 9 and a diagnosis of depression/dysthymia to identify the beginning of the episode (initial patient population). Successful completion of the quality action for this measure looks for a PHQ-9 score of less than 5 at the twelve month mark (plus or minus 30 days) from the initial onset of the episode. CMS is soliciting comments regarding this proposal, including operational concerns and the technical feasibility for implementation in the 2015 GPRO Web Interface. We note that, in addition to addressing changes in evidence-based practices, we are modifying the GPRO Web interface in an effort to align with the proposed measure changes in the Medicare Shared Savings Program specified in section III.M., 1006622=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we established the requirement that EPs who seek to report CQMs electronically under the Medicare EHR Incentive Program must use the most recent version of the electronic specifications for the CQMs (78 FR 74756). When establishing this requirement, we did not account for instances where errors are discovered in the updated electronic measure specifications. To account for these instances and consistent with the proposal set forth in the PQRS in section III.K, we propose that, beginning in CY 2015, if we discover errors in the most recently updated electronic measure specifications for a certain measure, we would use the version of electronic measure specifications that immediately precedes the most recently updated electronic measure specifications., 305155=During the comment period on the CY 2014 final rule with comment period, we received nominations and supporting documentation for two codes to be considered as potentially misvalued codes. We evaluated the supporting documentation for each nominated code to ascertain whether the submitted information demonstrated that the code should be proposed as potentially misvalued., 747412=In the November 2011 Medicare Shared Savings Program final rule (76 FR 67948), we noted that because Accountable Care Organization (ACO) providers/suppliers that are EPs are considered to be a group practice for purposes of qualifying for a PQRS incentive under the Shared Savings Program, we would publicly report ACO performance on quality measures on Physician Compare in the same way as we report performance on quality measures for PQRS GPRO group practices. Public reporting of performance on these measures is presented at the ACO level only. The first sub-set of ACO measures was also published on the Web site in February 2014. ACO measures can be viewed by following the link for Accountable Care Organization (ACO) Quality Data on the homepage of the Physician Compare Web site (http://medicare.gov/physiciancompare/aco/search.html)., 309553=We believe that a review of the codes in Table 10 is warranted to assess changes in physician work and to update direct PE inputs since these codes have not been reviewed since CY 2009 or earlier. Furthermore, since these codes have significant impact on PFS payment at the specialty level, a review of the relativity of the codes is essential to ensure that the work and PE RVUs are appropriately relative within the specialty and across specialties, as discussed previously. For these reasons, we are proposing the codes listed in Table 10 as potentially misvalued., 359675=In 2005, the OIG examined whether global surgical packages are appropriately valued. In its report on eye and ocular surgeries, \u201cNational Review of Evaluation and Management Services Included in Eye and Ocular Adnexa Global Surgery Fees for Calendar Year 2005\u201d (A-05-07-00077), the OIG reviewed a sample of 300 eye and ocular surgeries, and counted the actual number of face-to-face services recorded in the patients' medical records to establish whether and, if so, how many post-operative E/M services were furnished by the surgeons. For about two-thirds of the claims sampled by the OIG, surgeons provided fewer E/M services in the post-operative period than were included in the global surgical package payment for each procedure. A small percentage of the surgeons furnished more E/M services than were included in the global surgical package payment. The OIG identified the number of face-to-face services recorded in the medical record, but did not review the medical necessity of the surgeries or the related E/M services. The OIG concluded that the RVUs for these global surgical packages are too high because they include a higher number of E/M services than typically are furnished within the global period for the reviewed procedures., 306289=CPT code 99174 (instrument-based ocular screening (eg, photoscreening, automated-refraction), bilateral) was also nominated for review as a potentially misvalued code. The nominator asserted that CPT code 99174 is misvalued because of outdated capital equipment inputs and the removal of supply code SK110 (fee, image analysis) from the code's direct PE inputs. (The latter change was proposed and finalized during CY 2014 notice and comment rulemaking). In establishing our public nomination process, we specified that the we would only consider nominations of active codes that are covered by Medicare at the time of the nomination stating, \u201cWe also are limiting the review of RVUs to codes that are active, covered by Medicare, and for which the RVUs are used for payment purposes under the PFS so that resources are not expended on the review of codes with RVUs that have no financial impact on the PFS.\u201d (76 FR 73059). CPT code 99174 is non-covered on the PFS and therefore does not meet the criteria for review as a potentially misvalued code. Accordingly, we are not proposing CPT code 99174 as a potentially misvalued code., 782826=The PQRS regulation is located at 42 CFR 414.90. The program requirements for the 2007 through 2014 PQRS incentives and the 2015 and 2016 PQRS payment adjustment that were previously established, as well as information on the PQRS, including related laws and established requirements, are available at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/PQRS/index.html. In addition, the 2012 PQRS and eRx Experience Report, which provides information about eligible professional participation in PQRS, is available for download at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/PQRS/Downloads/2012-PQRS-and-eRx-Experience-Report.zip., 119051=Baltimore, MD 21244-1850., 289198=As MedPAC noted in its March 2009 Report to Congress, in the intervening years since MedPAC made the initial recommendations, \u201cCMS and the RUC have taken several steps to improve the review process.\u201d Also, since that time Congress added section 1848(c)(2)(K)(ii) to the Act, which augments our efforts. It directs the Secretary to specifically examine, as determined appropriate, potentially misvalued services in the following seven categories:, 284891=Section 1848(c)(1)(C) of the Act defines the MP component as \u201cthe portion of the resources used in furnishing the service that reflects malpractice expenses in furnishing the service.\u201d Section 1848 (c)(2)(C)(iii) of the Act specifies that MP expense RVUs shall be determined based on the relative MP expense resources involved in furnishing the service. (See section II.C. of this proposed rule for more detail on the MP component.), 809050=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74456), we finalized our proposal to require \u201cthat group practices register to participate in the GPRO by September 30 of the year in which the reporting period occurs (that is September 30, 2014 for reporting periods occurring in 2014), as proposed.\u201d However, we noted that, in order \u201cto respond to the commenters concerns to provide timelier feedback on performance on CG CAHPS in the future, we anticipate proposing an earlier deadline for group practices to register to participate in the GPRO in future years\u201d (78 FR 74456). Indeed, to provide timelier feedback on performance on CAHPS for PQRS, we propose to modify the deadline that a group practice must register to participate in the GPRO to June 30 of the year in which the reporting period occurs (that is, June 30, 2015, for reporting periods occurring in 2015). Although this proposed GPRO registration deadline would provide less time for a group practice to decide whether to participate in the GPRO, we believe the benefit of providing timelier feedback reports outweighs this concern., 729415=Section 403.904(d)(3) requires the reporting of stock, stock option or any other ownership interest. We are proposing to require applicable manufacturers to report such payments as distinct categories. This will enable us to collect more specific data regarding the forms of payment made by applicable manufacturers. After issuing the February 8, 2013 final rule and the development of the Open Payments system, we determined that this specificity will increase the ease of data aggregation within the system, and also enhance consumer's use of the data. We seek comments on the extent to which users of this data set find this disaggregation to be useful, and whether this change presents operational or other issues on the part of applicable manufacturers., 718750=In the February 8, 2013 Federal Register (78 FR 9458), we published the \u201cTransparency Reports and Reporting of Physician Ownership or Investment Interests\u201d final rule which implemented section 1128G to the Act, as added by section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act. Under section 1128G(a)(1) of the Act, manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologicals, and medical supplies (applicable manufacturers) are required to submit on an annual basis information about certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals (collectively called covered recipients) during the course of the preceding calendar year. Section 1128G(a)(2) of the Act requires applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations (GPOs) to disclose any ownership or investment interests in such entities held by physicians or their immediate family members, as well as information on any payments or other transfers of value provided to such physician owners or investors. The implementing regulations are at 42 CFR Part 402, subpart A, and Part 403, subpart I. We have organized these reporting requirements under the \u201cOpen Payments (Sunshine Act)\u201d program., 167001=Section 220(i) of the PAMA also requires the Secretary to make publicly available the information we considered when establishing the multiple procedure payment reduction (MPPR) policy for the professional component of advanced imaging procedures. The policy reduces the amount paid for the professional component when two advanced imaging procedures are furnished in the same session. The policy was effective for individual physicians on January 1, 2012 and for physicians in the same group practice on January 1, 2013., 732129=CMS launched the first phase of Physician Compare on December 30, 2010 (http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare). In the initial phase, we posted the names of EPs that satisfactorily submitted quality data for the 2009 PQRS, as required by section 1848(m)(5)(G) of the Act., 763436=In addition to making all 2015 PQRS GPRO measures available for public reporting, we seek comment on creating composites using 2015 data and publishing composite scores in 2016 by grouping measures based on the PQRS GPRO measure groups, if technically feasible. We will analyze the data collected in 2015 and conduct psychometric and statistical analyses, looking at how the measures best fit together and how accurately they are measuring the composite concept, to create composites for certain PQRS GPRO measure groups, including but not limited to:, 843963=For EHR reporting, consistent with the criterion finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive that aligns with the criteria established for meeting the CQM component of meaningful use under the EHR Incentive Program and in accordance with the group practice reporting requirements under section 1848(m)(3)(C) of the Act, for those group practices that choose to report using an EHR, we propose to modify \u00a7 414.90(j) to indicate the following satisfactory reporting criterion via a direct EHR product that is CEHRT or an EHR data submission vendor that is CEHRT for ALL group practices who select to participate in the GPRO for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment: For the 12-month reporting period for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, the group practice would report 9 measures covering at least 3 domains. If the group practice's CEHRT does not contain patient data for at least 9 measures covering at least 3 domains, then the group practice must report the measures for which there is patient data. A group practice must report on at least 1 measure for which there is Medicare patient data., 340106=For CY 2014, we modified the code descriptors of G0416 through G0419 so that these codes could be used for any method of prostate needle biopsy services, rather than only for prostate saturation biopsies. The CY 2014 descriptions are:, 738781=Since the initial launch of the Web site, we have continued to build on and improve Physician Compare. On June 27, 2013, we launched a full redesign of Physician Compare bringing significant improvements including a complete overhaul of the underlying database and a new Intelligent Search feature, addressing two of our stakeholders' primary critiques of the site\u2014the accuracy and currency of the database and the limitations of the search function\u2014and considerably improving Web site functionality and usability. PECOS, as the sole source of verified Medicare professional information, is the primary source of administrative information on Physician Compare. With the redesign, however, we incorporated the use of Medicare Fee-For-Service claims information to verify the information in PECOS to help ensure only the most current and accurate information is included on the site., 207170=Maintenance: This factor for maintenance was proposed and finalized during rulemaking for CY 1998 PFS (62 FR 33164). Several stakeholders have suggested that this maintenance factor assumption should be variable. We solicit comment regarding reliable data on maintenance costs that vary for particular equipment items., 732546=Section 10331(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act also required that, no later than January 1, 2013, and for reporting periods that began no earlier than January 1, 2012, we implement a plan for making publicly available through Physician Compare information on physician performance that provides comparable information on quality and patient experience measures. We met this requirement in advance of January 1, 2013, as outlined below, and plan to continue addressing elements of the plan through rulemaking., 514539=Establishing valuations for newly created and revised CPT codes is a routine part of maintaining the PFS. Since its inception it has also been a priority to revalue services regularly to assure that the payment rates reflect the changing trends in the practice of medicine and current prices for inputs used in the PE calculations. Initially this was accomplished primarily through the five-year review process, which resulted in revised RVUs for CY 1997, CY 2002, CY 2007, and CY 2012. Under the five-year review process, revisions in RVUs were proposed in a proposed rule and finalized in a final rule. In addition to the five-year reviews, in each year beginning with CY 2009, CMS and the RUC have identified a number of potentially misvalued codes using various identification screens, such as codes with high growth rates, codes that are frequently billed together, and high expenditure codes. Section 3134 of the Affordable Care Act codified the potentially misvalued code initiative under section 1848(c)(2)(K) of the Act., 795397=Specifically, in accordance with the final criterion that required eligible professionals to report on at least 1 outcome measure, we required that an entity possess at least 1 outcome measure for which its participating eligible professionals may report (78 FR 74470). As we explain in further detail in section III.K. of this proposed rule, we are proposing that an eligible professional wishing to meet the proposed criterion for satisfactory participation in a QCDR for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment report on at least 3 outcome measures (or if less than 3 outcome measures are available for reporting, report on at least 2 outcome measures and at least 1 of the following types of measures: resource use; patient experience of care; or efficiency/appropriate use). Accordingly, we are proposing to amend the requirement for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment to require a QCDR to possess at least 3 outcome measures (or, in lieu of 3 outcome measures, at least 2 outcome measures and at least 1 of the following other types of measures\u2014resource use, patient experience of care, or efficiency/appropriate use)., 618359=The Super Rural Bonus under section 1834(l)(12) of the Act has been extended several times. Recently, section 1104(b) of the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013, enacted on December 26, 2013, as Division B (Medicare and Other Health Provisions) of Public Law 113-67, amended section 1834(l)(12)(A) of the Act to extend this rural bonus through March 31, 2014. Subsequently, section 104(b) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-93, enacted on April 1, 2014) amended section 1834(l)(12)(A) of the Act to extend this rural bonus again through March 31, 2015. Therefore, we are continuing to apply the 22.6 percent rural bonus described above (in the same manner as in previous years), to ground ambulance services with dates of service before April 1, 2015 where transportation originates in a qualified rural area. Accordingly, we are proposing to revise \u00a7 414.610(c)(5)(ii) to conform the regulations to these statutory requirements. (For a discussion of past legislation extending section 1834(l)(12) of the Act, please see the CY 2014 PFS final rule (78 FR 74439 through 74440))., 825772=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, although we finalized satisfactory participation criteria for the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment that are less stringent than the satisfactory participation criteria we finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive, we noted that it was \u201cour intention to fully move towards the reporting of 9 measures covering at least 3 domains to meet the criteria for satisfactory participation for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment\u201d (78 FR 74477). Specifically, we finalized the following two criteria for the satisfactory participation in a QCDR for the 2014 PQRS incentive at \u00a7 414.90(i)(3): For the 12-month 2014 reporting period, report at least 9 measures available for reporting under the QCDR covering at least 3 of the NQS domains, and report each measure for at least 50 percent of the eligible professional's applicable patients. Of the measures reported via a QCDR, the eligible professional must report on at least 1 outcome measure., 789960=Furthermore, in the CY 2013 PFS final rule, we noted that qualified registries have until the last Friday of February following the applicable reporting period (for example, February 28, 2014, for reporting periods ending in 2013) to submit quality measures data on behalf of its eligible professionals (77 FR 69182). We continue to receive stakeholder feedback, particularly from qualified registries currently participating in the PQRS, urging us to extend this submission deadline due to the time it takes for these qualified registries to collect and analyze the quality measures data received after the end of the reporting period. While, at the time, we emphasized the need to have quality measures data received by CMS no later than the last Friday of the February occurring after the end of the applicable reporting period, we believe it is now feasible to extend this deadline. Therefore, we propose to extend the deadline for qualified registries to submit quality measures data, including, but not limited to, calculations and results, to March 31 following the end of the applicable reporting period (for example, March 31, 2016, for reporting periods ending in 2015)., 616429=Section 414(c) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108-173, enacted on December 8, 2003) (MMA) added section 1834(l)(12) to the Act, which specified that in the case of ground ambulance services furnished on or after July 1, 2004, and before January 1, 2010, for which transportation originates in a qualified rural area (as described in the statute), the Secretary shall provide for a percent increase in the base rate of the fee schedule for such transports. The statute requires this percent increase to be based on the Secretary's estimate of the average cost per trip for such services (not taking into account mileage) in the lowest quartile of all rural county populations as compared to the average cost per trip for such services (not taking into account mileage) in the highest quartile of rural county populations. Using the methodology specified in the July 1, 2004 interim final rule (69 FR 40288), we determined that this percent increase was equal to 22.6 percent. As required by the MMA, this payment increase was applied to ground ambulance transports that originated in a \u201cqualified rural area\u201d; that is, to transports that originated in a rural area included in those areas comprising the lowest 25th percentile of all rural populations arrayed by population density. For this purpose, rural areas included Goldsmith areas (a type of rural census tract). This rural bonus is sometimes referred to as the \u201cSuper Rural Bonus\u201d and the qualified rural areas (also known as \u201csuper rural\u201d areas) are identified during the claims adjudicative process via the use of a data field included on the CMS-supplied ZIP code File., 826853=To be consistent with the number of measures reported for the satisfactory participation criterion we finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive, for purposes of the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment (which would be based on data reported during the 12-month period that falls in CY 2015), we propose to modify \u00a7 414.90(k) to add the following criteria for individual eligible professionals to satisfactorily participate in a QCDR for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment: For the 12-month reporting period for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, the eligible professional would report at least 9 measures available for reporting under a QCDR covering at least 3 of the NQS domains, AND report each measure for at least 50 percent of the eligible professional's patients. Of these measures, the eligible professional would report on at least 3 outcome measures, OR, if 3 outcomes measures are not available, report on at least 2 outcome measures and at least 1 of the following types of measures\u2014resource use, patient experience of care, or efficiency/appropriate use., 1004762=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74756), we finalized our proposal to require EPs who seek to report CQMs electronically under the Medicare EHR Incentive Program to use the most recent version of the electronic specifications for the CQMs and have CEHRT that is tested and certified to the most recent version of the electronic specifications for the CQMs. We noted it is important for EPs to electronically report the most recent versions of the electronic specifications for the CQMs as updated measure versions correct minor inaccuracies found in prior measure versions. We stated that to ensure that CEHRT products can successfully transmit CQM data using the most recent version of the electronic specifications for the CQMs, it is important that the product be tested and certified to the most recent version of the electronic specifications for the CQMs., 527333=Our recent revaluation of the four epidural injection codes provides an example of the concerns that have been expressed with the existing process. In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we established interim final values for four epidural injection codes, which resulted in payment reductions for the services when furnished in the office setting of between 35 percent and 56 percent. (In the facility setting, the reductions range from 17 percent to 33 percent). One of these codes had been identified as a potentially misvalued code 2 years earlier. The affected specialties had been involved in the RUC process and were generally aware that the family of codes would be revalued on an as interim basis in an upcoming rule. They were also aware that the RUC had made significant changes to the direct PE inputs, including removal of the radiographic-fluoroscopy room, which explains, in large part, the reduction to values in the office setting. The societies representing the affected specialty were also aware of significant reductions in the RUC-recommended \u201ctime\u201d to furnish the procedures based on the most recent survey of practitioners who furnish the services, which resulted in reductions in both the work and PE portion of the values. Although the specialties were aware of the changes that the RUC was recommending to direct PE inputs, they were not specifically aware of how those changes would affect the values and payment rate. In addition, we decreased the work RVUs for these procedures because we found the RUC-recommended work RVUs did not adequately reflect the RUC-recommended decreases in time. This decision is consistent with our general practice when the best available information shows that the time involved in furnishing the service has gone down, and in the absence of information suggesting an increase in work intensity. Since the interim final values for these codes were issued in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we have received numerous comments that will be useful to us as we consider finalizing values for these codes. If we had followed a process that involved proposing values for these codes in a proposed rule, we would have been able to consider the additional information contained in these comments prior to making payments for the services based upon revised values. (See section II.B.3.b.2 of this proposed rule for a discussion of proposed valuation of these epidural injection codes for CY 2015)., 823614=Section 601(b) of the ATRA amended section 1848(m)(3) of the Act, by redesignating subparagraph (D) as subparagraph (F) and adding new subparagraphs (D) and (E), to provide for a new standard for individual eligible professionals to satisfy the PQRS beginning in 2014, based on satisfactory participation in a QCDR., 856117=In addition to CAHPS for PQRS, we received comments last year supporting the inclusion of the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers Surgical Care Survey (S-CAHPS). The commenters stated that the CG-CAHPS survey would not accurately reflect the care provided by single- or multispecialty surgical or anesthesia groups. The commenters noted that S-CAHPS has been tested by the same standards as CG-CAHPS and follows the same collection mechanism as the CG-CAHPS. The S-CAHPS expands on the CG-CAHPS by focusing on aspects of surgical quality, which are important from the patient's perspective and for which the patient is the best source of information. The survey asks patients to provide feedback on surgical care, surgeons, their staff, and anesthesia care. It assesses patients' experiences with surgical care in both the inpatient and outpatient settings by asking respondents about their experience before, during and after surgery. We agree with the commenters on the importance of allowing for the administration of S-CAHPS reporting and wish to allow for reporting of S-CAHPS in the PQRS for reporting mechanisms other than the QCDR. However, at this time, due to the cost and time it would take to find vendors to collect S-CAHPS data, it is not technically feasible to implement the reporting of the S-CAHPS survey measures for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment. We seek comments on how to allow for reporting of the S-CAHPS survey measures for the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment and beyond., 328612=Based upon our analysis of the Medicare claims data and comments received on the CY 2014 final rule with comment period, it appears that these codes are typically furnished with imaging guidance. Thus, we believe it would be appropriate for the injection and imaging guidance codes to be bundled and the inputs for image guidance to be included in the valuation of the epidural injection codes as it is for transforaminal and paravertebral codes. We do not believe the epidural injection codes can be appropriately valued without considering the typical use of image guidance. We also believe this will help assure relativity with other injection codes that include the image guidance. To determine how to appropriately value resources for the combined codes, we believe more information is needed. Accordingly, we propose to include CPT codes 62310, 62311, 62318 and 62319 on the potentially misvalued code list so that we can obtain information to support their valuation with the image guidance included. In the meantime, we are proposing to revert to the CY 2013 input values for CPT codes 62310, 62311, 62318 and 62319 for CY 2015. Specifically, we will use the CY 2013 work RVUs, work times, and direct PE inputs to establish payment rates for CY 2015. The work, PE, and MP RVUs for these codes are listed in Addendum B and the time values for all CY 2015 codes are listed in the file \u201cCY 2015 PFS Work Time,\u201d available on the CMS Web site under downloads for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/PFS-Federal-Regulation-Notices.html. The direct PE inputs are displayed the file \u201cCY 2015 PFS Direct PE Inputs,\u201d available on the CMS Web site under downloads for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/PFS-Federal-Regulation-Notices.html., 765161=Similar to composite scores, benchmarks are also important to ensuring that the quality data published on Physician Compare are accurately interpreted and appropriately understood. A benchmark will allow consumers to more easily evaluate the information published by providing a point of comparison between groups. We continue to receive requests from all stakeholders, but especially consumers, to add this information to Physician Compare. As a result, we propose to publicly report on Physician Compare in 2016 benchmarks for 2015 PQRS GPRO data using the same methodology currently used under the Shared Savings Program. This ACO benchmark methodology was previously finalized in the November 2011 Shared Savings Program final rule (76 FR 67898), as amended in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74759). Details on this methodology can be found on CMS.gov at http://cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/sharedsavingsprogram/Downloads/MSSP-QM-Benchmarks.pdf. We propose to follow this methodology using the 2014 PQRS GPRO data, however., 812977=To be consistent with the satisfactory reporting criterion we finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive, we are proposing to modify \u00a7 414.90(j) and propose the following criterion for individual eligible professionals reporting via claims and registry: For the 12-month reporting period for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment, the eligible professional would report at least 9 measures, covering at least 3 of the NQS domains AND report each measure for at least 50 percent of the eligible professional's Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies. Of the measures reported, if the eligible professional sees at least 1 Medicare patient in a face-to-face encounter, as we propose to define that term below, the eligible professional would report on at least 2 measures contained in the proposed cross-cutting measure set specified in Table 21. If less than 9 measures apply to the eligible professional, the eligible professional would report up to 8 measure(s), AND report each measure for at least 50 percent of the Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies. Measures with a 0 percent performance rate would not be counted., 492166=Originating sites, which are defined as \u201cone of the specified sites where an eligible telehealth individual is located at the time the service is being furnished via a telecommunications system,\u201d are paid under the PFS for serving as an originating site for telehealth services. The statute specifies both the types of entities that can serve as originating sites and geographic qualifications for originating sites. With regard to geographic qualifications, our regulations at \u00a7 410.78 (b)(4) limit originating sites to those located in rural health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) or in a county that is not included in a metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Historically, we have defined rural HPSAs to be those located outside of, MSAs. Effective January 1, 2014, we modified the regulations regarding originating sites to define rural HPSAs as those located in rural census tracts as determined by the Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP) of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) (78 FR 74811). Defining \u201crural\u201d to include geographic areas located in rural census tracts within MSAs allows for broader inclusion of sites within HPSAs as telehealth originating sites. Adopting the more precise definition of \u201crural\u201d for this purpose expands access to health care services for Medicare beneficiaries located in rural areas. HRSA has developed a Web site tool to provide assistance to potential originating sites to determine their geographic status. To access this tool, see the CMS Web site at www.cms.gov/teleheath/., 343096=Under section 1861(ddd) of the Act, we added coverage for a new preventive benefit, Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity, effective November 29, 2011, and created HCPCS code G0447 (Face-to-face behavioral counseling for obesity, 15 minutes) for reporting and payment of individual behavioral counseling for obesity. Coverage requirements specific to this service are delineated in the Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual, Pub. 100-03, Chapter 1, Section 210, available at http://www.cms.gov/manuals/downloads/ncd103c1_Part4.pdf., 613912=Section 146(a) of the MIPPA amended section 1834(l)(13)(A) of the Act to specify that, effective for ground ambulance services furnished on or after July 1, 2008 and before January 1, 2010, the ambulance fee schedule amounts for ground ambulance services shall be increased as follows:, 273681=After thorough consideration of the comments regarding the CY 2014 proposal, we continue to believe that there are a various possibilities for leveraging the use of available hospital cost data in the PE RVU methodology to ensure that the relative costs for PFS services are developed using data that is auditable and comprehensively and regularly updated. Although some commenters questioned the premise that the hospital cost data are more accurate than the information used to establish PE RVUs, we continue to believe that the routinely updated, auditable resource cost information submitted contemporaneously by a wide array of providers across the country is a valid reflection of \u201crelative\u201d resources and could be useful to supplement the resource cost information developed under our current methodology based upon a typical case that are developed with information from a small number of representative practitioners for a small percentage of codes in any particular year., 161393=Also, in the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we announced the following for CY 2014: the total PFS update of \u221220.1 percent; the initial estimate for the SGR of \u221216.7 percent; and a CF of $27.2006. These figures were calculated based on the statutory provisions in effect on November 27, 2013, when the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period was issued., 864344=Taking into consideration the statutory and non-statutory criteria we described previously, this section contains our proposals for the inclusion or removal of measures in PQRS for 2015 and beyond. We are classifying all proposed measures against six domains based on the NQS's six priorities, as follows:, 845442=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we introduced satisfactory reporting criterion for the 2014 PQRS incentive related to reporting the CG CAHPS survey measures via a CMS-certified survey vendor (see Table 49 at 78 FR 74486). Consistent with the criterion finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive and the group practice reporting requirements under section 1848(m)(3)(C) of the Act, we are proposing the following 3 options (of which a group practice would be able to select 1 out of the 3 options) for satisfactory reporting for the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment for group practices comprised of 25 or more eligible professionals:, 117440=3. By express or overnight mail. You may send written comments to the following address ONLY: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services, Attention: CMS-1612-P, Mail Stop C4-26-05, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21244-1850., 657858=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74440-74445, 74820), we finalized a process under which we would reexamine the payment amounts for test codes on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) for possible payment revision based on technological changes beginning with the CY 2015 proposed rule, and we codified this process at \u00a7 414.511. After we finalized this process, Congress enacted the PAMA. Section 216 of the PAMA creates new section 1834A of the Act, which requires us to implement a new Medicare payment system for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests based on private payor rates. Section 216 of the PAMA also rescinds the statutory authority in section 1833(h)(2)(A)(i) of the Act for adjustments based on technological changes for tests furnished on or after April 1, 2014 (PAMA's enactment date). As a result of these provisions, we are not proposing any revisions to payment amounts for test codes on the CLFS based on technological changes and are proposing to remove \u00a7 414.511. Instead, we will establish through rulemaking the parameters for the collection of private payor rate information and other requirements to implement section 216 of the PAMA., 472727=Additional information on our proposed methodology for updating the MP RVUs may be found in our contractor's report, \u201cReport on the CY 2015 Update of the Malpractice RVUs,\u201d which is available on the CMS Web site. It is located under the supporting documents section of the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule located at http://www.cms.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/., 627018=While the revisions OMB published on February 28, 2013 are not as sweeping as the changes made when we adopted the CBSA geographic designations for CY 2007, the February 28, 2013 OMB bulletin does contain a number of significant changes. For example, if we adopt the revised OMB delineations, there would be new CBSAs, urban counties that would become rural, rural counties that would become urban, and existing CBSAs that would be split apart. Because the bulletin was not issued until February 28, 2013, with supporting data not available until later, and because the changes made by the bulletin and their ramifications needed to be extensively reviewed and verified, we were unable to undertake such a lengthy process before publication of the CY 2014 PFS proposed rule, and thus, did not implement the changes to the OMB delineations under the ambulance fee schedule for CY 2014. We have reviewed our findings and impacts relating to the new OMB delineations, and find no compelling reason to further delay implementation. We believe it is important for the ambulance fee schedule to use the latest labor market area delineations available as soon as reasonably possible in order to maintain a more accurate and up-to-date payment system that reflects the reality of population shifts., 258821=In the CY 2011 PFS final rule with comment period (75 FR 73205), we finalized a process to act on public requests to update equipment and supply price and equipment useful life inputs through annual rulemaking beginning with the CY 2012 PFS proposed rule. During 2013, we received a request to update the price of SD216 (catheter, balloon, esophageal or rectal (graded distention test)) from $217 to $237.50. We also received a request to update the price of SL196 (kit, HER-2/neu DNA Probe) from $105 to $144.50. We received invoices that documented updated pricing for each of these supply items. We propose to increase the price associated with these supply items., 562989=Accordingly, we used the work RVU and work time associated with the non-face-to-face portion of CPT code 99495 as a foundation to determine our proposed values for CCM services. Specifically, we are proposing a work RVU for GXXX1 of 0.61, which is the portion of the work RVU for CPT code 99495 that remains after subtracting the work attributable to the face-to-face visit. (CPT code 99214 (office/outpatient visit est) was used to value CPT code 99495), which has a work RVU of 1.50.) Similarly, we are proposing a work time of 15 minutes for HCPCS code GXXX1 for CY 2015 based on the time attributable to the non-face-to-face portion of CPT 99495. The work time file associated with this PFS proposed rule is available on the CMS Web site in the Downloads section for the CY 2015 PFS proposed rule at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/PFS-Federal-Regulation-Notices.html., 816831=In addition, we understand that there may be instances where an eligible professional may not have at least 9 measures applicable to an eligible professional's practice. In this instance, like the criterion we finalized for the 2014 PQRS incentive (see Table 47 at 78 FR 74479), an eligible professional reporting on less than 9 measures would still be able to meet the satisfactory reporting criterion via claims and registry if the eligible professional reports on 1-8 measures, as applicable, to the eligible professional's practice. If an eligible professional reports on 1-8 measures, the eligible professional would be subject to the MAV process, which would allow us to determine whether an eligible professional should have reported quality data codes for additional measures. In addition, the MAV will also allow us to determine whether a group practice should have reported on any of the proposed cross-cutting measures specified in Table 21. The MAV process we are proposing to implement for claims and registry is the same process that was established for reporting periods occurring in 2014 for the 2014 PQRS incentive. For more information on the claims MAV process, please visit http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/PQRS/Downloads/2014_PQRS_Claims_MeasureApplicabilityValidation_12132013.zip. For more information on the registry MAV process, please visit http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/PQRS/Downloads/2014_PQRS_Registry_MeasureApplicabilityValidation_12132013.zip., 544048=For those codes for which we do not receive the RUC recommendations by January 15th of a year, we would delay revaluing the code for one year (or until we receive RUC recommendations for the code before January 15th of a year) and include proposed values in the following year's rule. Thus, we would include proposed values prior to using the new code (in the case of new or revised codes) or revising the value (in the case of potentially misvalued codes). Due to the complexities involved in code changes and rate setting, there could be some circumstances where, even when we receive the RUC recommendations by January 15th of a year, we are not able to propose values in that year's proposed rule. For example, we might not have recommendations for the whole family or we might need additional information to appropriately value these codes. In situations where it would not be appropriate or possible to propose values for certain new, revised, or potentially misvalued codes, we would treat them in the same way as those for which we did not receive recommendations before January 15th., 720731=Since the publication and implementation of the February 8, 2013 final rule, various stakeholders have provided feedback to CMS regarding certain aspects of these reporting requirements. Specifically, \u00a7 403.904(g)(1) excludes the reporting of payments associated with certain continuing education events, and \u00a7 403.904(c)(8) requires reporting of the marketed name for drugs and biologicals but makes reporting the marketed name of devices or medical supplies optional. We are proposing a change to \u00a7 403.904(g) to correct an unintended consequence of the current regulatory text. Additionally, at \u00a7 403.904(c)(8), we are proposing to make the reporting requirements consistent by requiring the reporting of the marketed name for drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical supplies which are associated with a payment or other transfer of value., 873673=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we stated that \u201cunless there are errors discovered in updated electronic measure specifications, the PQRS intends to use the most recent, updated versions of electronically specified clinical quality measures for that year\u201d (78 FR 74489). We propose that, if we discover errors in the most recently updated electronic measure specifications for a certain measure, we would use the version of electronic measure specifications that immediately precedes the most recently updated electronic measure specifications., 169388=The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) believes all patients, their families, and their health care providers should have consistent and timely access to their health information in a standardized format that can be securely exchanged between the patient, providers, and others involved in the patient's care. (HHS August 2013 Statement, \u201cPrinciples and Strategies for Accelerating Health Information Exchange,\u201d see http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/acceleratinghieprinciples_strategy.pdf) HHS is committed to accelerating health information exchange (HIE) through the use of electronic health records (EHRs) and other types of health information technology (HIT) across the broader care continuum through a number of initiatives including: (1) Alignment of incentives and payment adjustments to encourage provider adoption and optimization of HIT and HIE services through Medicare and Medicaid payment policies; (2) adoption of common standards and certification requirements for interoperable HIT; (3) support for privacy and security of patient information across all HIE-focused initiatives; and (4) governance of health information networks. These initiatives are designed to encourage HIE among health care providers, including professionals and hospitals eligible for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs and those who are not eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs, and are designed to improve care delivery and coordination across the entire care continuum. For example, the Transition of Care Measure #2 in Stage 2 of the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs requires HIE to share summary records for more than 10 percent of care transitions. In addition, to increase flexibility in ONC's HIT Certification Program and expand HIT certification, ONC has issued a proposed rule concerning a voluntary 2015 Edition of EHR certification criteria, which would more easily accommodate the certification of HIT used in all health care settings where health care providers are not typically eligible for incentive payments under the EHR Incentive Programs, to facilitate greater HIE across the entire care continuum. We believe that HIE and the use of certified EHRs can effectively and efficiently help providers improve internal care delivery practices, support management of patient care across the continuum, and support the reporting of electronically specified clinical quality measures (eCQMs). More information on the Voluntary 2015 Edition EHR Certification Criteria proposed rule is available at http://healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/standards-and-certification-regulations., 742080=As we finalized in the 2014 PFS final rule with comment period (78 FR 74450), we will publicly report the names of those EPs who report the 2014 PQRS Cardiovascular Prevention measures group in support of the Million Hearts Initiative on Physician Compare in 2015 by including a check mark in the quality programs section of the profile page. We propose to also continue to include this information annually in the year following the year it is reported (for example, 2015 data will be included on Physician Compare in 2016). Finally, we will also indicate with a green check mark those individuals who have earned the 2014 PQRS Maintenance of Certification Incentive (Additional Incentive) on the Web site in 2015 (78 FR 74450)., 333551=Medicare currently pays for mammography services through both CPT codes, (77055 (mammography; unilateral), 77056 (mammography; bilateral) and 77057 (screening mammography, bilateral (2-view film study of each breast)) and HCPCS G-codes, (G0202 (screening mammography, producing direct digital image, bilateral, all views), G0204 (diagnostic mammography, producing direct digital image, bilateral, all views), and G0206 (diagnostic mammography, producing direct digital image, unilateral, all views)). The CPT codes were designed to be used for mammography regardless of whether film or digital technology is used. However, for Medicare purposes, the HCPCS G-codes were created to be used for digital technology in response to special payment rules for digital mammography included in the Medicare Benefit Improvements and Protection Act of 2000., 711032=Finally, as noted above, section 1842(b)(6)(D)(iv) of the Act requires that the claim form submitted to the contractor include the substitute physician's unique identifier. Currently, the unique identifier used to identify a physician is the physician's NPI. Prior to the implementation of the NPI, the Unique Physician Identification Number (UPIN) was used. Because a substitute physician's NPI is not captured on the CMS-1500 claim form or on the appropriate electronic claim, physicians and other entities that furnish services to beneficiaries through the use of a substitute physician are required to enter a modifier on the CMS-1500 claim form or on the appropriate electronic claim indicating that the services were furnished by a substitute physician; and to keep a record of each service provided by the substitute physician, associated with the substitute physician's UPIN or NPI; and to make this record available to the contractor upon request. (See Medicare Claims Processing Manual (Pub. 100-4), Chapter 1, Sections 30.2.10 and 30.2.11) However, having a NPI or UPIN does not necessarily mean that the substitute physician is enrolled in the Medicare program. Without being enrolled in Medicare, we do not know whether the substitute physician has the proper credentials to furnish the services being billed under section 1842(b)(6)(D) of the Act or if the substitute physician is sanctioned or excluded from Medicare. The importance of enrollment and the resulting transparency afforded the Medicare program and its beneficiaries was recognized by the Congress when it included in the Affordable Care Act a requirement that physicians and other eligible NPPs enroll in the Medicare program if they wish to order or refer certain items or services for Medicare beneficiaries. This includes those physicians and other eligible NPPs who do not and will not submit claims to a Medicare contractor for the services they furnish. We are seeking comments regarding how to achieve similar transparency in the context of substitute physician billing arrangements for the identity of the individual actually furnishing the service to a beneficiary., 177037=Section 1848(c)(2)(H)(i) of the Act requires us to use the medical oncology supplemental survey data submitted in 2003 for oncology drug administration services. Therefore, the PE/HR for medical oncology, hematology, and hematology/oncology reflects the continued use of these supplemental survey data., 794983=In the CY 2014 PFS final rule with comment period, we established certain requirements for entities to become QCDRs for the purpose of having their participating eligible professionals meet the criteria for satisfactory participation in a QCDR for purposes of the PQRS incentives and payment adjustments (78 FR 74465 through 74474)., 288039=In its March 2006 Report to the Congress, MedPAC discussed the importance of appropriately valuing physicians' services, noting that \u201cmisvalued services can distort the price signals for physicians' services as well as for other health care services that physicians order, such as hospital services.\u201d In that same report MedPAC postulated that physicians' services under the PFS can become misvalued over time. MedPAC stated, \u201cWhen a new service is added to the PFS, it may be assigned a relatively high value because of the time, technical skill, and psychological stress that are often required to furnish that service. Over time, the work required for certain services would be expected to decline as physicians become more familiar with the service and more efficient in furnishing it.\u201d We believe services can also become overvalued when PE declines. This can happen when the costs of equipment and supplies fall, or when equipment is used more frequently than is estimated in the PE methodology, reducing its cost per use. Likewise, services can become undervalued when physician work increases or PE rises., 475960=Section 1848(e)(1)(A) of the Act requires us to develop separate Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) to measure relative cost differences among localities compared to the national average for each of the three fee schedule components (that is, work, PE, and MP). Although the statute requires that the PE and MP GPCIs reflect the full relative cost differences, section 1848(e)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act requires that the work GPCIs reflect only one-quarter of the relative cost differences compared to the national average. In addition, section 1848(e)(1)(G) of the Act sets a permanent 1.5 work GPCI floor for services furnished in Alaska beginning January 1, 2009, and section 1848(e)(1)(I) of the Act sets a permanent 1.0 PE GPCI floor for services furnished in frontier states (as defined in section 1848(e)(1)(I) of the Act) beginning January 1, 2011. Additionally, section 1848(e)(1)(E) of the Act provided for a 1.0 floor for the work GPCIs, which was set to expire on March 31, 2014. However, section 102 of the PAMA extended application of the 1.0 floor to the work GPCI through March 31, 2015.}",

(5) Setup File Information Step 18: Add the direct PE RVUs from Step 6 to the indirect PE RVUs from Step 17 and apply the final PE budget neutrality (BN) adjustment.
