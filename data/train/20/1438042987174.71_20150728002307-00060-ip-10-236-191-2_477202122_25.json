    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described in terms of a preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that various modifications and alterations might be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, although the invention has been described with relation to the emulation of X86 processors, it should be understood that the invention applies just as well to programs designed for other processor architectures, and programs that execute on virtual machines, such as P code, Postscript, or Java programs. The invention should therefore be measured in terms of the claims which follow. The final optimization shown in this sample is the use of the alias hardware to eliminate stores. This eliminates the stores from within the loop body, and performs them only in the loop epilog. This reduces the number of host instructions within the loop body to three compared to the original ten target instructions.
