    "textBeforeTable": "Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers: We recommend that customers apply the update immediately. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. This update resolves a public vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations. The vulnerability is documented in the \"Vulnerability Details\" section of this bulletin.
