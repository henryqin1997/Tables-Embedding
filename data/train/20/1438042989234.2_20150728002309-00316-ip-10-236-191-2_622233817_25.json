The ability to work with institution records will be available in Connexion browser in late May 2007 and in Connexion client 2.0 in late June 2007. All OCLC member catalogers have read-only access to all institution records. With read-only access, you can retrieve, copy and paste, export, or print institution records. You can also derive bibliographic master records or bibliographic constant data records from IRs. If your OCLC cataloging profile (determined by your logon authorization) includes institution records, you can create, add, delete, move and take other actions on your own institution records. Otherwise, you have read-only access to the institution records of other libraries. Who can use institution records? Institution records contain additional cataloging data, including all local data, such as local call numbers, holdings locations within the institution, or local or copy-specific notes. Purpose of institution records The master record to which institution records correspond is identified in the IR by the master record OCLC number, which the system supplies in field 079 \u2021a. Like bibliographic master records, bibliographic institution records are assigned unique OCLC control numbers in WorldCat. A new index (ir:) is available to search specifically for IR OCLC numbers.
