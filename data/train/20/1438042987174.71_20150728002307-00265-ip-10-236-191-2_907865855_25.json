            "It's very small, but cozy. The mansion is currently closed which is a bummer. Also, most of the teachers are awesome but sometimes it's a hit or a miss."

Free food sometimes makes an appearance, but for sure there are sweets involved. For example, since the second to last week of April was the last week of classes, a carnival-like event was set up on campus. It truly felt like something I remember as a kid when I went to the circus., 124975=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2373=I enjoyed my stay in Belmont in July, and am looking forward to going to their holiday concert in December. The campus is small and the people are so welcoming, The counselor, Julie, is so humble and helpful. They offer an amazing tutoring program and the staff is unbelievably awesome! You can talk to them easily without feeling nervous., 5808=Yes. Our school is very expensive. But based on the experience I have had so far I would say that its worth it. I have learned so much about the world and myself in one year of Notre Dame de Namur. The academic and campus experience is definitely worth the amount. And our school also provides a nice amount of financial aid. My tuition and fee was 41000. I ended up paying $8000 out of pocket., 31598=Notre Dame de Namur University is a small (less than 2000 students), Catholic Liberal Arts institution nestled in the foothills surrounding the San Francisco Bay. NDNU is more than a school, with the small class size and professors who truly care it is a family. And if anyone asks it is the real Notre Dame. :), 110764=If you like to have a long summer, this school is definitely for you. Winter break may feel too short, but when it comes to summer, it feels endless. The school year ends between the last week of April and the first week of May, making summer feel like its four months long instead of three.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The professors here are truly amazing and they really care for the students. They actually know my name!! Which I found that at a lot of students' professors don't know their names at other schools. They are known by numbers. I've learned so much about the world through my classes in one year. For instance in my Advanced Conversation French class we not only learn the language of France but we have in-depth debates on problems in the world, in French. Its truly an amazing learning experience at NDNU.
