LUCKY FOURSOME has some good connections and has been the backstretch buzz., 472215=Aqueduct gets its name from the nearby conduit built by the Brooklyn Water Works between 1854 and 1858, feeding water from Long Island to the Ridgewood Reservoir, which was decommissioned in 1989. Unlike the more upscale Belmont Park, Aqueduct is a \u201cblue-collar\u201d track within city limits (South Ozone Park in Queens, to be specific) and is open year-round, two important considerations which have kept the site in operation despite several campaigns to shut it down and develop the land.

Run 2400 meters, or a mile and a half, no turf horse anywhere on the face of the earth attracts better quality thoroughbreds. It's open only to three-year-old colts and fillies. Known internationally as, simply, \"The Arc\", thoroughbred trainers and jockeys dream of winning this race in exactly the same way American trainers and jockeys dream of winning the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, Kentucky. Unlike the Kentucky Derby, which is run on dirt and right-handed, the Arc is run on turf and is a left-handed race. Some of the greatest international horses in recent years have failed to win the Arc, including the great Japanese horse Deep Impact, son of Sunday Silence, who was disqualified in 2006 and placed third. The race is so competitive that in the nearly 90 year history of the race, the largest margin of victory is only 6 lengths. At one time, as many as 30 horses were allowed to run in the Arc at one time, but at present the limit on the size of the field is 20. The winner of the 2008 Arc was the amazing filly Zarkava, the first filly to win the race since 1993. Zarkava retired after the race undefeated, but just imagine playing your game and running the great American filly Zenyatta against Zarkava! The contrasts would be striking. Zarkava is a textbook European horse. She's small, she's agile, and she has great stamina. Zenyatta is very large, and has never run beyond nine furlongs in a race. Both of them are closers, though, which means that a race in our online horse game that had both of them in it would set up for a great finish! If you were to run Zarkava at an American track like Belmont for instance, would her small size be a problem in the long stretch drive? Conversely, would Zenyatta be able to handle the irregularly shaped racetracks seen in Europe, with their sometimes long turns and sharper twists? How would Zarkava take to a dirt racecourse? There's no way to know until you fire up our great game at Horse Racing Fantasy. In our game, American horses can race on international racecourses like Longchamp, and international horses can invade the United States and race at Santa Anita Park. Of course, those are just two examples! Our game features an amazing stable of American and international horses that can supply you with an amazing online gaming experience. After trying it once, you'll be hooked on our horse racing action game!, 88960=ROBERT NOBLE drops back to the price he was claimed for two starts back, after beating half the field in his initial attempt on the inner track; wants fast footing. CEE NO MORE made up some ground after breaking in the air at six furlongs just six days ago; runner-up finish going 1 1/16 miles at Belmont bodes well. THUG DADDY set moderate fractions on the same Dec. 15 card as Robert Noble, and was clearly second best in an improved effort; this will be his third start back from a layoff. SHYLOCK should be coming late., 399917=KILLADAY impressed in two starts on the inner track last winter, crushing maidens and leading to deep stretch against heavily favored Our Amazing Rose ($2.80); taken to come back running. TRUE ROMANCE had a busy fall running three times in six weeks, and led at the stretch call each time capped by wide trip from post 13 in the Safely Kept Stakes; cuts back a furlong. BLITHELY returned from nearly a year off to get through state bred conditions nicely, before racing wide into the teeth of a strong rail bias in off-the-turf mile Nov. 29; she is 3 for 3 at six furlongs. MALLORY STREET should be flying fast late and should get a piece with these., 169228=OVER MY HEAD ran a number in early fall at Belmont going a mile that would beat these, and which indicates she may like stretching back out; in very light here too with Roman up and not totally in over her head. She's Now 7 in 2015 and still in search of her second career win, FLIRTATIOUS SPRING gets the vote to hit the board with these coming off a fade in the slop vs. richer restricted claimers; may have to catch LIL' ZILLA who became this group's only winner on the inner dirt with a maiden score opening week against Peach Lake (see 1st race), an effort that received the top last-out Beyer; realistically spotted and may gate to wire this field.

PURA VIDA ZEN was haltered from a game score at this level at the fall meet that was her 11th win from 29 dirt starts; lost all chance leaping at the break at 5 1/2 furlongs in last. OFF MY CLOUD beat the top two posting back-to-back wins in October, and those remain her only fast-track races since May; goes for new barn.
