On March\u00a029, 2006, we filed petitions for reassessment with the ODT to protest each assessment as well as request corrected assessments for each tax year.\u00a0 On October\u00a012, 2006, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the ODT that stated if the ODT\u0092s positions are ultimately sustained in judicial proceedings, the total additional tax liability that we would be subject to for tax years 2002 through 2004 would be no more than $50.7 million before interest as opposed to the $90.8 million stated in the ODT\u0092s correspondence of February\u00a013, 2006.\u00a0 We believe we have recorded adequate tax reserves related to the proposed adjustments; however, we cannot predict the outcome, which could be material to our results of operations and cash flows., 922611=(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2003, we recorded a cumulative effect of an accounting change related to the adoption of SFAS 143 \u0093Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations\u0094. In 2005, we recorded an additional obligation in response to FASB Interpretation Number (FIN) 47, \u0093Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No.\u00a0143.\u0094 See Item 7 - Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations., 162416=1-2385, 649683=Substantially all property and plants of DP&L are subject to the lien of the mortgage securing DP&L\u0092s First and Refunding Mortgage, dated as of October\u00a01, 1935 with the Bank of New York, as Trustee (Mortgage)., 942593=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DPL\u0092s revenues increased 9% over 2006 primarily due to increases in weather driven retail sales volume, increases in average retail and wholesale rates and the revenue realized from the PJM capacity auctions.\u00a0 DPL\u0092s fuel costs decreased 6% from 2006, while purchased power costs and operation and maintenance expense increased over 2006., 615690=On October\u00a01, 2004, in compliance with Ohio law, DP&L turned over control of its transmission functions and fully integrated into PJM.\u00a0 The price at which DPL and DP&L can sell its generation capacity and energy is now more dependent upon the overall operation of the PJM market.\u00a0 While DP&L can continue to make bi-lateral transactions to sell its generation through a willing-buyer and willing-seller relationship, any transactions that are not pre-arranged are subject to market conditions at PJM.\u00a0 The rules\u00a0governing the various regional power markets also change from time to time which could affect DP&L\u0092s costs and revenues.\u00a0 DP&L incurs fees and costs to participate in the RTO.\u00a0 We may be limited with respect to the price at which power may be sold from certain generating units and we may be required to expand our transmission system according to decisions made by the RTO rather than our internal planning process.\u00a0 While RTO transmission rates were initially designed to be revenue neutral, various proposals and proceedings currently taking place at FERC may cause transmission rates to change from time to time.\u00a0 In addition, developing rules\u00a0associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights may have a financial impact on DP&L.\u00a0 Likewise, in December\u00a02006, FERC approved PJM\u0092s RPM. \u00a0RPM became effective in 2007 and provides forward and locational pricing for generation capacity.\u00a0 The financial impact of RPM on DP&L will depend on a variety of factors, including the market behavior of various participants.\u00a0 The RPM auctions have been held for the 2007/2008 through 2010/2011 delivery years.\u00a0 At this time, these auction results are expected to have no material financial impact to DPL.\u00a0 Because the RTO market rules\u00a0are continuing to evolve, we cannot fully assess the impact that these power markets or other ongoing RTO developments may have on DP&L., 547243=DP&L provides transmission and wholesale electric service to twelve\u00a0municipal customers in its service territory, which in turn distribute electricity principally within their incorporated limits.\u00a0 DP&L also maintains an interconnection agreement with one municipality that has the capability to generate a portion of its own energy requirements.\u00a0\u00a0 Approximately one percent of total electricity sales in 2007 represented sales to these municipalities., 242553=DPL is a regional energy company organized in 1985 under the laws of Ohio.\u00a0 Our executive offices are located at 1065 Woodman Drive, Dayton, Ohio 45432 \u0096 telephone (937) 224-6000., 683455=As long as DP&L preferred stock is outstanding, DP&L\u0092s Amended Articles of Incorporation contain provisions restricting the payment of cash dividends on any of its common stock if, after giving effect to such dividend, the aggregate of all such dividends distributed subsequent to December\u00a031, 1946 exceeds the net income of DP&L available for dividends on its Common Stock subsequent to December\u00a031, 1946, plus $1.2\u00a0million. As of December\u00a031, 2007, all earnings reinvested in the business of DP&L were available for DP&L common stock dividends. We expect all 2007 earnings reinvested in the business of DP&L to be available for DP&L common stock dividends, payable to DPL., 539485=As a member of PJM, DP&L is subject to charges and costs associated with PJM operations as approved by the FERC.\u00a0 On April\u00a019, 2007, the FERC issued an order that modified the traditional method of allocating costs associated with new high voltage planned transmission facilities.\u00a0 FERC ordered that the cost of new, high-voltage facilities be socialized across the PJM region.\u00a0 The costs of the new facilities at lower voltages will continue to be assigned to the load centers that benefit from the new facilities.\u00a0 In a companion order also issued on April\u00a019, 2007, FERC did not change the existing allocation of costs associated with existing transmission facilities, upholding the existing PJM rate design.\u00a0 On February\u00a01, 2008, FERC issued an order on rehearing that upheld its original decision.\u00a0 The overall impact of FERC\u0092s orders cannot be definitively assessed at this time because not all new planned construction is likely to happen.\u00a0 The additional costs allocated to the Company for new large transmission approved projects are expected to be immaterial in 2008 and 2009 but could rise to approximately $12 million or more annually by 2012.\u00a0 As a result, on December\u00a021, 2007, DP&L filed an application seeking PUCO authority to defer costs associated with these new high-voltage transmission projects for future recovery through retail rates., 548077=On September\u00a028, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published proposed regulations which would change the treatment of transactions involving the provision of insurance between members of a consolidated tax group.\u00a0 If adopted, these regulations would affect the tax position previously held by Miami Valley Insurance Company (MVIC), our captive insurance company that provides insurance to us and our subsidiaries.\u00a0 The IRS requested comments by December\u00a027, 2007.\u00a0 MVIC filed comments as part of a coalition formed for this purpose which included captive insurance companies and parent companies, captive insurance industry associations and insurance departments of numerous states which have captive insurance regulations.\u00a0 These entities all oppose the IRS\u0092 proposed regulations.\u00a0 The IRS will review all comments received and may publish a final regulation in the same form, or may substantially change or abandon its proposed regulation.\u00a0 Since we do not know what steps the IRS will take, we cannot predict the impact on DPL, DP&L or MVIC at this time., 635870=On November\u00a014th, 2007 the OAQDA issued $90 million of collateralized, variable rate revenue bonds, 2007 Series\u00a0A due November\u00a01, 2040 (the Series\u00a0A Revenue Bonds). In turn, DP&L borrowed these funds from the OAQDA. The Series\u00a0A Revenue Bonds are auction rate bonds. Every 35 days, the bonds are offered for sale to the market. The auction process sets the interest rate for the upcoming holding period by selling the bonds to the purchasers who bid to purchase the bonds at the lowest interest rate.\u00a0 A credit enhancement feature of the Series\u00a0A Revenue Bonds is the insurance policy issued by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), which insures principal and interest payments on the Series\u00a0A Revenue Bonds when such payments are due.\u00a0 FGIC\u0092s credit rating was recently downgraded by Fitch Ratings and Standard\u00a0& Poor\u0092s from AAA to AA, and by Moody\u0092s from Aaa to A3. The current credit crisis and economic conditions, along with FGIC\u0092s recent credit rating downgrades, has resulted in fewer investors participating in the auction process for the Series\u00a0A Revenue Bonds, which has resulted in increased interest rates on the Series\u00a0A Revenue Bonds., 542334=In connection with DP&L and other utilities joining PJM, the FERC ordered utilities to eliminate certain charges to implement transitional payments, known as Seams Elimination Charge Adjustment (SECA), effective December\u00a01, 2004 through March\u00a031, 2006, subject to refund. Through this proceeding, DP&L was obligated to pay SECA charges to other utilities, but received a net benefit from these transitional payments.\u00a0 The hearing was held in May\u00a02006 and an initial decision was issued on August\u00a010, 2006 that, if upheld by the FERC, would reduce the amount of SECA charges DP&L and other parties are permitted to recover.\u00a0 DP&L, among others, has taken exception to the initial decision.\u00a0 A final FERC order on this issue is still pending.\u00a0 We have entered into a significant number of bi-lateral settlement agreements with certain parties to resolve the matter, which by design will be unaffected by the FERC\u0092s decision to affirm, modify or reject the initial decision.\u00a0 DP&L management believes that appropriate reserves have been established in the event that SECA collections not resolved by settlement are required to be refunded.\u00a0 The ultimate outcome of the proceeding establishing SECA rates is uncertain at this time. However, based on the amount of reserves established for this item, the results of this proceeding are not expected to have a material adverse effect on DP&L\u0092s results of operations., 423132=Combustion turbine output is dependent on ambient conditions and is higher in the winter than in the summer.\u00a0 Our all-time net peak load was 3,300 MW, occurring August\u00a08, 2007., 1057794=For the year ended December\u00a031, 2007, revenues increased $122.2 million, or 9%, to $1,515.7 from $1,393.5 for the same period in the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of higher average rates for retail and wholesale sales, higher retail sales volume and an increase in RTOs ancillary revenue.\u00a0Retail revenues increased $74.8 million, resulting from a 3% increase in weather driven sales volume as total degree days increased 9%, and a 3% increase in average retail rates primarily relating to the environmental investment and storm recovery riders. These increases resulted in a $38.4 million rate variance and a $34.1 million sales volume variance.\u00a0 Wholesale revenue increased $6.2 million primarily resulting from a 12% increase in wholesale average rates, partially offset by an 8% decrease in sales volume. This resulted in a favorable $19.8 million wholesale price variance and an unfavorable $13.6 million volume variance. RTO ancillary and other revenues, consisting primarily of compensation for use of DP&L\u0092s transmission assets, regulation services, reactive supply and operating reserves and capacity payments under the RPM construct, increased $41.2 million over the same period in 2006. This increase primarily resulted from $30.9 million realized from the PJM capacity auction, $8.7 million of PJM transmission losses and congestion credits and $2.3 million from the sale of financial transmission rights (FTRs). RTO ancillary revenues from the PJM capacity auction are substantially offset by RTO ancillary charges for PJM capacity charges included in purchased power. Other RTO ancillary revenues are partially offset by other RTO ancillary charges in purchased power., 578917=In November\u00a02004, the State of New York and seven other states filed suit against AEP and various subsidiaries, alleging various CAA violations at a number of AEP electric generating facilities, including Conesville Unit 4 co-owned by CG&E, DP&L and CSP.\u00a0 AEP settled this case on October\u00a09, 2007 and DP&L will be required to pay approximately $0.5 million for its partial ownership of Conesville Unit 4., 177963=Indicate by check mark whether each registrant (1)\u00a0has filed all reports required to be filed by Section\u00a013 or 15(d)\u00a0of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2)\u00a0has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days., 266855=Installation of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment at the Killen Station was successfully completed in June\u00a02007.\u00a0 DP&L is in the process of installing the same FGD technology on the four units at Stuart Station.\u00a0 The first Stuart Station unit was placed into service in early February\u00a02008 with the remaining units to be commissioned prior to June\u00a02008., 263689=On April\u00a025, 2007, DPLE completed the sale of its Darby and Greenville electric peaking generation facilities, providing DPL with approximately $151 million in cash.\u00a0 Darby Station was sold to Columbus Southern Power (CSP), a utility subsidiary of American Electric Power (AEP), for approximately $102 million in cash. Greenville Station was sold to Buckeye Power,\u00a0Inc. for approximately $49 million in cash., 590723=In September\u00a02002, DP&L and other parties received a special notice that the USEPA considers us to be PRPs for the clean-up of hazardous substances at the South Dayton Dump landfill site.\u00a0 In August\u00a02005, DP&L and other parties received a general notice regarding the performance of a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) under a Superfund Alternative Approach.\u00a0 In October\u00a02005, DP&L received a special notice letter inviting it to enter into negotiations with USEPA to conduct the RI/FS. Information available to DP&L does not demonstrate that it contributed hazardous substances to the site.\u00a0 Should USEPA pursue a civil action, DP&L will vigorously challenge it., 538282=As part of Ohio\u0092s electric deregulation law, all of the state\u0092s investor-owned utilities are required to join an RTO.\u00a0 In October\u00a02004, DP&L successfully integrated its 1,000 miles of high-voltage transmission into the PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) RTO.\u00a0 The role of the RTO is to administer an electric marketplace and ensure reliability of the transmission grid.\u00a0 PJM ensures the reliability of the high-voltage electric power system serving 51 million people in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.\u00a0 PJM coordinates and directs the operation of the region\u0092s transmission grid, administers the world\u0092s largest competitive wholesale electricity market and plans regional transmission expansion improvements to maintain grid reliability and relieve congestion., 602332=On September\u00a025, 2007, Senate Bill 221 was introduced in the Ohio Legislature.\u00a0 The bill codifies, in draft form, the governor\u0092s proposed energy policy.\u00a0 The bill was passed by the Senate on October\u00a031, 2007.\u00a0 The Ohio House of Representatives has assigned the bill to committee and is taking testimony from interested parties.\u00a0 As the bill is not yet in final form, the outcome of this proceeding and its financial impact on the Company cannot be determined at this time., 262525=On April\u00a018, 2007, DPL and Associated Electric\u00a0& Gas Insurance Services (AEGIS) mediated and reached a settlement regarding an insurance claim filed with AEGIS on January\u00a013, 2006 to recoup legal fees associated with the three former executives in which AEGIS agreed to pay DPL $14.5 million for legal fees incurred by DPL and associated with this litigation. The settlement agreement was signed and executed on April\u00a030, 2007 and the recovery was recorded by DPL as a reduction to operation and maintenance expense., 689353=Copyright c 2008, Standard & Poor\u0092s a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved., 591832=In December\u00a02003, DP&L and other parties received a special notice that the USEPA considers us to be PRPs for the clean-up of hazardous substances at the Tremont City landfill site.\u00a0 Information available to DP&L does not demonstrate that it contributed hazardous substances to the site., 687058=The graph below compares the cumulative 5-year total return of holders of DPL Inc.\u0092s common stock with the cumulative total returns of the Dow Jones US Industrial Average index, the S&P Utilities index and the S&P Electric Utilities index. The graph tracks the performance of a $1,000 investment in our common stock and in each index (with the reinvestment of all dividends) from 12/31/2002 to 12/31/2007., 532963=DP&L agreed to implement a Voluntary Enrollment Program (VEP) that would provide customers with an option to choose a competitive supplier to provide their retail generation service should switching not reach 20% in each customer class.\u00a0 The 20% threshold has never been reached.\u00a0\u00a0 Customers who elected to participate in the program were grouped together and collectively bid out to CRES providers.\u00a0 Four rounds of bidding were conducted for the 2007 program resulting in no bids being received.\u00a0 DP&L has completed its obligations under this program., 528533=On April\u00a04, 2005, DP&L filed a request with the PUCO to implement a rate stabilization surcharge (RSS), effective January\u00a01, 2006, to recover cost increases associated with environmental capital, related operation and maintenance costs and fuel expenses.\u00a0 Subsequently, DP&L entered into a settlement agreement that extended DP&L\u0092s rate stabilization period through December\u00a031, 2010 and allowed for recovery of certain fuel and environmental investment costs through an environmental rider.\u00a0 The PUCO adopted the settlement, but ruled that the environmental rider shall be by-passable by all customers who take service from alternate generation suppliers.\u00a0 Consistent with the RSS Stipulation approved by the PUCO and prior orders, DP&L made a tariff filing that was approved by the PUCO in November\u00a02006 to implement the environmental investment rider beginning January\u00a01, 2007. The case was appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court by the OCC.\u00a0 On September\u00a05, 2007, the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the PUCO\u0092s approval of the settlement agreement but remanded one aspect of the order, that the RSS tariff should be part of the Company\u0092s generation tariffs instead of distribution tariffs.\u00a0 On December\u00a06, 2007, DP&L filed to modify its tariffs accordingly and does not expect this change to impact future revenues., 685829=Information regarding our equity compensation plans as of December\u00a031, 2007 is disclosed in Item\u00a012 \u0096 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, which incorporates such information by reference to our proxy statement for the 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders., 569802=On July\u00a015, 2003, the Ohio EPA submitted to the USEPA its recommendations for eight-hour ozone non-attainment boundaries for the metropolitan areas within Ohio.\u00a0 On April\u00a015, 2004, the USEPA issued its list of ozone non-attainment designations.\u00a0 Since these initial designations, the Ohio EPA has recommended that nine areas designated non-attainment be designated as attainment.\u00a0 Currently USEPA has redesignated eight of those areas as attainment for the eight-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards, including counties where DP&L owns and/or operates a number of facilities.\u00a0 In redesignating these counties as attainment, the Ohio EPA submitted and USEPA approved amendments to the SIP that include maintenance plans for these areas.\u00a0 In June\u00a02007, the Ohio EPA submitted a plan to USEPA for attaining the eight-hour ozone standard for the Cincinnati-Hamilton area in which DP&L owns a number of facilities.\u00a0 DP&L cannot determine the outcome of this redesignation effort at this time., 197972=The aggregate market value of DPL Inc.\u0092s common stock held by non-affiliates of DPL Inc. as of June\u00a029, 2007 was approximately $3.2 billion based on a closing sale price of $28.34 on that date as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.\u00a0 All of the common stock of The Dayton Power and Light Company is owned by DPL Inc.\u00a0 As of February 20, 2008, each registrant had the following shares of common stock outstanding:, 1079228=For 2007, operation and maintenance expense increased $7.4 million, or 3%, compared to 2006. This variance was primarily the result of increased boiler maintenance costs of $17.7 million, a $9.4 million increase related to operating expenses for the generating facilities, a $3.5 million increase related to turbine maintenance costs, and a $3.0 million increase in overhead line and substation maintenance costs. These increases were partially offset by a $14.5 million insurance settlement reimbursing us for legal fees relating to the litigation with the three former executives, a gain on the sale of the corporate aircraft of $6.0 million, a $4.2 million decrease in legal costs primarily resulting from the settlement of the litigation with the former executives, and $0.4 million decrease in employee benefits costs resulting from a $5.2 million reduction in pension expense, partially offset by a $4.8 million increase in employee benefits., 1064093=For 2006, gross margin of $885.4 million increased $70.7 million, or 9%, from $814.7 million in 2005. As a percentage of total revenues, gross margin remained flat in 2006 at 63.5% compared to 63.4% in 2005. This result reflects the favorable impact of the rate stabilization plan on revenues offsetting the increasing fuel and purchase power costs. In prior years, rising fuel and purchase power costs had eroded gross margin. Fuel costs, which include coal, gas, oil and emission allowance costs, increased by $12.2 million, or 4%, in 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to increased fuel prices. Purchased power increased $25.7 million, or 19%, in 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 primarily resulting from increased charges of $30.8 million relating to higher purchased power volume and an increase of $0.9 million in RTO ancillary costs. These increases were partially offset by lower average market rates reducing purchased power costs by $6.0 million. The increase in purchased power volume resulted from our decision to purchase power at lower average market rates instead of running our higher cost generating facilities. In addition, from time to time, we purchased power when our generating facilities were not available due to scheduled maintenance and forced outages., 564562=On December\u00a017, 2003, the USEPA proposed the Interstate Air Quality Rule\u00a0(IAQR) designed to reduce and permanently cap SO2 and NOX emissions from electric utilities.\u00a0 The proposed IAQR focused on states, including Ohio, whose power plant emissions are believed to be significantly contributing to fine particle and ozone pollution in other downwind states in the eastern United States.\u00a0 On June\u00a010, 2004, the USEPA issued a supplemental proposal to the IAQR, now renamed the Clean Air Interstate Rule\u00a0(CAIR).\u00a0 The final rules\u00a0were signed on March\u00a010, 2005 and were published on May\u00a012, 2005.\u00a0 On August\u00a024, 2005, the USEPA proposed additional revisions to the CAIR and initiated reconsideration on one issue. \u00a0Although we cannot predict the, 652152=On May\u00a021, 2007, we settled the litigation with the three former executives in exchange for our payment of $25 million.\u00a0 As part of this settlement, the three former executives relinquished and dismissed all their claims including those related to certain deferred compensation, restricted stock units (RSUs), MVE,\u00a0Inc. (discontinued subsidiary of DPL) incentives, stock options, and legal fees. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements., 567672=On January\u00a030, 2004, the USEPA published its proposal to restrict mercury and other air toxins from coal-fired and oil-fired utility plants.\u00a0 The USEPA \u0093de-listed\u0094 mercury as a hazardous air pollutant from coal-fired and oil-fired utility plants and, instead, proposed a cap-and-trade approach to regulate the total amount of mercury emissions allowed from such sources.\u00a0 The final Clean Air Mercury Rule\u00a0(CAMR) was signed March\u00a015, 2005 and was published on May\u00a018, 2005.\u00a0 On March\u00a029, 2005, nine states sued USEPA, opposing the cap-and-trade regulatory approach taken by USEPA.\u00a0 In 2007, the Ohio EPA adopted rules\u00a0implementing the CAMR program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On February\u00a08, 2008, the Court of Appeals struck down the USEPA regulations, finding that the USEPA had not complied with statutory requirements applicable to \u0093de-listing\u0094 a hazardous air pollutant and that a cap-and-trade approach was not authorized by law for \u0093listed\u0094 hazardous air pollutants.\u00a0 The order is subject to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court which has a discretionary power to decide whether or not to hear an appeal., 946523=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On April\u00a025, 2007, DPLE completed the sale of its Darby and Greenville electric peaking generation facilities, providing DPL with approximately $151 million in cash.\u00a0 Darby Station was sold to Columbus Southern Power (CSP), a utility subsidiary of American Electric Power (AEP), for approximately $102 million in cash. Greenville Station was sold to Buckeye Power,\u00a0Inc. for approximately $49 million in cash., 609688=DP&L has provided service at rates governed by the PUCO-approved transition, market development and rate stabilization plans.\u00a0 Those rates have included a statutorily-required 5% rate reduction in the generation component of its residential rates, a further 2.5% reduction to the residential generation rate through 2008, fixed generation rates through December\u00a031, 2010, and frozen distribution rates through December\u00a031, 2008.\u00a0 The protection afforded by retail fuel clause recovery mechanisms was eliminated effective January\u00a01, 2001 by the implementation of customer choice in Ohio.\u00a0 Likewise, through the RSS Stipulation, DP&L extended its commitment to maintain pre-determined rates for generation through December\u00a031, 2010, and in exchange is permitted to charge two new rate riders to offset increases in fuel and environmental costs.\u00a0 Beginning January\u00a01, 2006, a RSS was implemented that recovered approximately $65 million additional revenue in 2006, net of customer discounts.\u00a0 The EIR could result in approximately $35 million additional revenue each year, net of customer discounts and assuming insignificant levels of customer switching.\u00a0 The PUCO ruled this rider will be bypassable by all customers who take service from alternative generation suppliers.\u00a0 Accordingly, the rates DP&L is allowed to charge may or may not match its expenses at any given time.\u00a0 Therefore, during this period (or possibly earlier by order of the PUCO), while DP&L will be subject to prevailing market prices for electricity, it would not necessarily be able to charge rates that produce timely or full recovery of its expenses.\u00a0 DP&L has historically maintained its rates at consistent levels since 1994, when the final phase of DP&L\u0092s last traditional rate case was implemented.\u00a0 However, as DP&L operates under its PUCO-approved RSS Stipulation, there can be no assurance that DP&L would be able to timely or fully recover unanticipated levels of expenses, including but not limited to those relating to fuel, coal and purchased power, compliance with environmental regulation, reliability initiatives and capital expenditures for the maintenance or repair of its plants or other properties., 534255=On August\u00a028, 2006, the Staff of the PUCO issued a report relating to compliance with the Federal Energy Policy of 2005.\u00a0 In that report the Staff makes recommendations to the Commission to implement new rules\u00a0and procedures relating to net metering, customer generator interconnection, stand by power, time-of-use rates, and renewable energy portfolio standards.\u00a0 DP&L, among others, filed comments and reply comments.\u00a0 In 2007, the Commission held a series of technical conferences on automated meter infrastructure, interconnection, net metering, and standby power rates.\u00a0 On December\u00a021, 2007, DP&L filed a series of tariffs to comply with this rule\u00a0making.\u00a0 The potential cost associated with new regulations from these proceedings cannot be quantified at this time., 592493=In November\u00a02007, a PRP group contacted DP&L seeking our financial participation in a settlement that the group had reached with the federal government with respect to the clean-up of an industrial site once owned by Carolina Transformer,\u00a0Inc.\u00a0 DP&L\u0092s business records clearly show we did not conduct business with Carolina Transformer that would require our participation in any clean-up of the site.\u00a0 DP&L has declined to participate in the clean-up of this site., 150580=SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 657026=We are also under audit review by various state agencies for tax years 2002 through 2006.\u00a0 We have also filed an appeal to the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals for tax years 1998 through 2001.\u00a0 Depending upon the outcome of these audits and the appeal, we may be required to increase our tax provision if actual amounts ultimately determined exceed recorded reserves.\u00a0 We believe we have adequate reserves in each tax jurisdiction but cannot predict the outcome of these audits., 261750=On March\u00a01, 2007, pursuant to the Company\u0092s strategy of reducing its long-term debt, DPL redeemed the $225 million 8.25% Senior Notes when they became due., 274785=2005, 581526=In November\u00a01999, the USEPA filed civil complaints and NOVs against operators and owners of certain generation facilities for alleged violations of the CAA.\u00a0 Generation units operated by CG&E (Beckjord Unit 6) and CSP (Conesville Unit 4) and co-owned by DP&L were referenced in these actions.\u00a0 Numerous northeast states have filed complaints or have indicated that they will be joining the USEPA\u0092s action against CG&E and CSP.\u00a0 DP&L was not identified in the NOVs, civil complaints or state actions., 653982=On May\u00a016, 2007, DPL filed a similar claim with Energy Insurance Mutual (EIM), to recoup additional legal expenses associated with our litigation against the former executives. That claim is pending., 258726=November\u00a02007, 503441=We have substantially all of the total expected coal volume needed to meet our retail and firm wholesale sales requirements for 2008 under contract.\u00a0 The majority of our contracted coal is purchased at fixed prices.\u00a0 Some contracts provide for periodic adjustments and some are priced based on market indices.\u00a0 Substantially all contracts have features that limit price escalations in any given year.\u00a0\u00a0 Our sulfur dioxide (SO2) allowance consumption was reduced in 2007 due to the installation of emission control equipment at a portion of our generation facilities.\u00a0 As a result of this reduction, we will have emission allowance inventory in excess of our needs which we plan to sell during 2008 and in future years.\u00a0 We did not purchase SO2 allowances or nitrogen oxide (NOX) allowances during 2007, nor do we plan to purchase any in 2008.\u00a0 Fuel costs are impacted by changes in volume and price and are driven by a number of variables including weather, reliability of coal deliveries, scheduled outages and generation plant mix.\u00a0 Based on higher volume and price, fuel costs are forecasted to be 15% to 25% higher in 2008 compared to 2007., 1059748=For the year ended December\u00a031, 2006, revenues increased $108.6 million, or 8%, to $1,393.5 from $1,284.9 for the same period in the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of higher average retail rates and higher wholesale sales volume, partially offset by lower retail sales volume and lower average rates for wholesale revenues. Retail revenues increased $64.8 million primarily resulting from an increase in average rates related to the Rate Stabilization Plan surcharge and other regulated asset recovery riders resulting in a $93.0 million price variance, partially offset by lower retail sales volume resulting in a $29.4 million volume variance. Sales volume declined 3% in 2006 from 2005 due to milder weather which resulted in lower heating and cooling degree days. Heating degree days declined 11% and cooling degree days declined 20%. Wholesale revenue increased $40.8 million primarily related to a 34% increase in sales volume resulting in a $45.8 million volume variance, partially offset by a decrease in wholesale average rates resulting in a $5.0 million price variance. For 2006, the RTO ancillary revenues increased $2.8 million, or 4%, to $77.2 million from $74.4 million in 2005., 662536=As of December\u00a031, 2007, there were 22,771 holders of record of DPL common equity, excluding individual participants in security position listings. The following table presents the high and low per share sales prices for DPL common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for each quarter of 2007 and 2006:, 578142=In March\u00a02000, as amended in June\u00a02004, the United States Department of Justice filed a complaint in an Indiana federal court against Cinergy Corp. (now part of Duke Energy) and two Cinergy subsidiaries for alleged violations of the CAA at various generation units operated by PSI Energy,\u00a0Inc. and CG&E, including generation units co-owned by DP&L (Beckjord Unit 6 and Miami Fort Unit 7).\u00a0 The defense is being led by Duke Energy and a trial is currently scheduled to begin later in 2008., 689091=Fiscal year ending December 31., 939886=Recently, the coal market has experienced unprecedented price increases. To highlight the significance of this volatility, the coal settle price on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) increased significantly during the first few weeks of 2008. We are now in a market for coal that clears on international, rather than solely domestic supply and consumption. Our domestic price is increasingly affected by international supply disruptions and demand balance. Exports from the U.S. have increased in recent years and most significantly during the last six months. In addition, domestic issues like government-imposed direct costs and permitting issues are affecting mining costs and supply availability. We have responded to increases in the price of coal by entering into contracts to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements and other energy-related commodities. We may not be able to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. To the extent we are not able to hedge against price volatility, our results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially affected., 604212=Changes in our customer base, including government aggregation, could lead to the entrance of competitors in our marketplace, affecting our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\u00a0 Although retail generation service has been a competitive service since January\u00a01, 2001, the competitive generation market has not developed in DP&L\u0092s service territory to any significant degree.\u00a0 The following are factors that could result in increased switching by customers to CRES providers in the future:, 641238=DPL\u0092s warrant holders could exercise their warrants to purchase 31.6 million shares of common stock at their discretion until March\u00a012, 2012. As a result, DPL could be required to issue up to 31.6 million common shares in exchange for the receipt of the exercise price of $21.00 per share or pursuant to a cashless exercise process. The exercise of all warrants would have a dilutive effect on us and would increase the number of common shares outstanding and increase our common share of dividend costs, thus affecting any existing guidance on EPS and our cash flows., 535345=On April\u00a03, 2007, the PUCO issued proposed revisions to the Commission\u0092s minimum electric service and safety standards.\u00a0 These rules\u00a0govern a variety of utility operations such as maintenance programs, new construction, meter reading, and distribution circuit performance.\u00a0 The proposed changes impact customer service requirements, reliability reporting and distribution inspection and maintenance programs, as well as increase the penalty the Commission may invoke if a utility is found to be in violation of these rules.\u00a0 DP&L, among others, filed comments and reply comments.\u00a0 DP&L may experience an increase in distribution operation and maintenance expense associated with the new rules.\u00a0 We are unable to determine the potential financial impact of these changes at this time., 424769=In 2007, we generated 99% of our electric output from coal-fired units and 1% from oil and natural gas-fired units., 634446=The current global credit crisis may adversely affect our business and financial results. During 2007, higher interest rates, falling property prices and a significant increase in the number of sub-prime mortgages originated in 2005 and 2006 contributed to dramatic increases in mortgage delinquencies and defaults in 2007. The anticipated future delinquencies among high-risk, or sub-prime, borrowers in the United States is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. The widespread dispersion of credit risk related to mortgage delinquencies and defaults through the securitization of mortgage-backed securities, sales of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and the creation of structured investment vehicles (SIVs), as well as the unclear impact on large banks of mortgage-backed securities, CDOs and SIVs, caused banks to reduce their loans to each other or make them at higher interest rates. Similarly, the ability of corporations to obtain funds through the issuance of debt was negatively impacted. We issue debt to cover the costs of certain of our operations and expenditures and the inability to issue such debt on reasonable terms or at all could negatively affect our business., 949912=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On October\u00a026, 2007, the Board of Directors approved a resolution permitting the transfer of 925,000 shares of DPL Inc. common stock from the DP&L Master Trust to The Dayton Power and Light Company Retirement Income Plan Trust (Pension). This transaction was completed on November\u00a026, 2007, contributing shares of common stock with a fair value of $27.4 million to the Pension and resulting in fully funded status at December\u00a031, 2007., 658046=On April\u00a02, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned the rulings of two lower courts and concluded that the CAA\u0092s New Source Review (NSR) requirements are triggered when a major physical or operational change at a facility results in an increase in the facility\u0092s annual emissions (Environmental Defense et al. v. Duke Energy Corp. et al.). The outcome of this case is significant to DP&L because it eliminates one of DP&L\u0092s major arguments in the lawsuit filed against it by the Sierra Club. The Court decided that an annual rate of emissions could be used to determine if major modifications have been made to a plant as opposed to an hourly emission rate as Duke had argued. Using the annual rate makes it more likely that most plant modifications will be found to be \u0093major\u0094 modifications, thus requiring EPA permits. DP&L can still defend against the allegations of NSR violations if it can establish that the activities at issue did not cause total annual emissions to increase or that the projects that resulted in increased emissions were undertaken for routine maintenance, repair, and replacement activities., 601187=Many of the requirements of the Ohio deregulation law were premised on the assumption that the wholesale generation market and, in turn, the retail generation market, would fully develop by the end of 2005, and that the price for generation for even those customers who choose to continue to purchase the service from the regulated utility would be set purely by the market.\u00a0 That did not occur.\u00a0 As a result, the PUCO and the utilities, including DP&L, have worked out plans to provide market-based pricing for generation service, but also to stabilize those rates for several years.\u00a0 What DP&L may propose and what the PUCO will approve in the future regarding pricing and cost recovery will depend on the degree to which the wholesale and retail electric generation markets have developed and the final outcome of the pending energy legislation in Ohio., 951496=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On February\u00a01, 2007 and on December\u00a013, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized dividend increases of approximately 4% and 6%, respectively, increasing our dividend per share from $1.00 per share to $1.10 per share.\u00a0 The 4% increase to dividends, were paid in each quarter during 2007.\u00a0 The 6% increase to dividends will be paid each quarter in 2008., 572739=On May\u00a05, 2004, the USEPA issued its proposed regional haze rule, which addresses how states should determine the Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for sources covered under the regional haze rule.\u00a0 Final rules\u00a0were published July\u00a06, 2005, providing states with several options for determining whether sources in the state should be subject to BART.\u00a0 In the final rule, USEPA made the determination that CAIR achieves greater progress than BART and may be used by states as a BART substitute.\u00a0 Numerous units owned and operated by us will be impacted by BART. \u00a0We cannot determine the extent of the impact until Ohio determines how BART will be implemented., 566517=outcome of the reconsideration proceedings, the petitions or the pending litigation, CAIR has had and will have a material effect on our operations.\u00a0 Phase I CAIR requirements tend to promote decisions to install FGD equipment and continuous operation of the currently installed Selective Catalytic Reduction equipment.\u00a0 In 2007, the Ohio EPA revised their State Implementation Plan (SIP) to incorporate a CAIR program consistent with the IAQR.\u00a0 The Ohio EPA is awaiting approval from the USEPA.\u00a0 Upon approval, the USEPA will distribute related CAIR NOX seasonal and annual emission allowances.\u00a0 As a result, DP&L has installed FGD equipment at the Killen generating station and is proceeding with the installation of FGD equipment at the Stuart generating station., 268971=On November\u00a015, 2007, the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority (OAQDA) issued $90\u00a0million of OAQDA Revenue Bonds 2007 Series\u00a0A, due November\u00a02040.\u00a0 See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements., 644381=Approximately 54% of our employees are under a collective bargaining agreement. During the third quarter of 2008, we will begin negotiation discussions with employees covered under our collective bargaining agreement which is set to expire in November\u00a02008. If the collective bargaining agreement expires before a new agreement is reached, we would attempt to persuade our employees to continue working while negotiations continue. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory relationship with our employees, however, it is possible that the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement could result in labor disruptions affecting some or all of our operations. We recognize the impact that any resulting labor stoppages\u00a0could have on our customers and have begun contingency planning if the collective bargaining agreement expires before a new one is reached. A lengthy strike by our employees would have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition., 586840=On July\u00a09, 2004, the USEPA issued final rules\u00a0pursuant to the Clean Water Act governing existing facilities that have cooling water intake structures.\u00a0 The rules\u00a0require an assessment of impingement and/or entrainment of organisms as a result of cooling water withdrawal.\u00a0 A number of parties appealed the rules\u00a0to the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York and the Court issued an opinion on January\u00a025, 2007 remanding several aspects of the rule\u00a0to USEPA for reconsideration.\u00a0 We are undertaking studies at two facilities but cannot predict the impact such studies may have on future operations or the outcome of the remanded rulemaking., 524770=On October\u00a031, 2007, the Ohio Senate passed Senate Bill 221.\u00a0 The Ohio House of Representatives has assigned the bill to the committee and is taking testimony from interested parties.\u00a0 In its current form, the bill states that the standard service offer in effect at the end of the utility\u0092s rate plan will remain in effect until the utility files either an electric security plan or a market rate option.\u00a0 Under the market rate option, the retail generation price will be set by a periodic competitive bid process after the utility demonstrates that there is effective competition in its service territory and that it can meet other market criteria set out in the proposed bill.\u00a0 Under the electric security plan option, the PUCO will establish rules\u00a0for filing an electric security plan which may allow for adjustments to the standard offer for costs associated with environmental compliance; fuel and purchased power; construction of new or investment in specified generating facilities; the provision of standby and default service, operating, maintenance, or other costs including taxes.\u00a0 Once an electric security plan is approved by the PUCO, the utility is required to file an infrastructure improvement plan that will specify the initiatives the utility will take to rebuild, upgrade or replace its electric distribution system.\u00a0 The proposed bill establishes a goal that by 2025, twenty-five percent of the generation used to supply standard offer generation service in the state will come from advanced energy resources, which may include: sustainable resources, clean coal technology, advanced nuclear generation, fuel cells and co-generation of which half must be met through facilities located in Ohio.\u00a0 Full compliance with the advanced energy standards may not be mandated if the price impact of compliance exceeds three percent.\u00a0 The bill creates an advanced energy advisory committee and a federal energy advocate that will evaluate the costs and benefits associated with Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO) on behalf of the state.\u00a0 It promotes construction of advanced energy projects by providing, 595356=DPL\u0092s construction additions were approximately $347 million, $352 million and $180 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are expected to approximate $205 million for 2008. \u00a0DP&L\u0092s construction additions were approximately $344 million, $349 million and $178 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.\u00a0 Planned construction additions of DP&L for 2008 are expected to approximate $203 million and relate to DP&L\u0092s environmental compliance program, power plant equipment, and its transmission and distribution system.\u00a0\u00a0All environmental additions made during the past three years pertain to DP&L and approximate $206 million, $246 million and $90 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively., 941290=2007 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW, 688881=*$1000 invested on 12/31/02 in stock or index-including reinvestment of dividends., 554623=The Federal Clean Water Act (FCWA), which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits.

We are also co-owners of electric generating stations operated by other investor-owned utilities, who are in various stages of constructing FGD facilities at these stations. Significant construction delays could adversely affect our ability to operate or may substantially increase our cost to operate these electric generating stations under federal environmental laws and regulations that become effective in 2010. For those electric generating stations where we are co-owners but do not operate, significant construction delays may substantially increase our pro rata share of the cost to operate those facilities beginning in 2010., 587887=On May\u00a04, 2004, the Ohio EPA issued a final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit (Permit) for J.M. Stuart Station that continued our authority to discharge water from the station into the Ohio River.\u00a0 During the three-year term of the Permit, we conducted a thermal discharge study to evaluate the technical feasibility and economic reasonableness of water cooling methods other than cooling towers.\u00a0 In December\u00a02006, we submitted an application for the renewal of the Permit that was due to expire on June\u00a030, 2007.\u00a0 In July\u00a02007 we received a draft permit proposing to continue our authority to discharge water from the station into the Ohio River.\u00a0 On February\u00a05, 2008 we received a letter from Ohio EPA indicating that they intend to impose a compliance schedule as part of the final Permit, that requires us to implement one of two diffuser options for the discharge of water from the station into the Ohio River as identified in the thermal discharge study.\u00a0\u00a0 The two diffuser options identified by Ohio EPA could cost approximately $33 million based on preliminary cost estimates, of which our pro-rata share would be approximately $11.5 million.\u00a0 We have not seen the compliance schedule and cannot predict the final outcome of this issue on future operations., 664440=2006, 561426=In 1990, the federal government amended the CAA to further regulate air pollution.\u00a0 Under the law, the USEPA sets limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the air anywhere in the United States.\u00a0 The CAA allows individual states to have stronger pollution controls, but states are not allowed to have weaker pollution controls than those set for the whole country.

DP&L\u0092s fuel costs decreased 6% from 2006 while purchased power costs and operation and maintenance expense increased over 2006., 256748=March\u00a02007, 579614=In November\u00a02004, various residents of the Village of Moscow, Ohio sued CG&E, as the operator of Zimmer generating station (co-owned by CG&E, DP&L and CSP), for alleged violations of the CAA and air pollution nuisances.\u00a0 CG&E, on behalf of all co-owners, is leading the defense of this matter., 544112=On August\u00a08, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the 2005 Act) was enacted.\u00a0 This new law encompasses several areas including, but not limited to:\u00a0 electric reliability, repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, promotion of energy infrastructure and preservation of a diverse fuel supply for electricity generation and energy efficiency.\u00a0 In response to the 2005 Act, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to amend its regulations to incorporate the criteria which an entity must satisfy in order to qualify to be an Electric Reliability, 1062291=For 2007, gross margin of $900.3 million increased $14.9 million, or 2%, from $885.4 million in 2006. As a percentage of total revenues, gross margin decreased to 59.4% in 2007 compared to 63.5% in 2006. This result primarily reflects the favorable impact of both retail and wholesale revenues discussed above and lower fuel costs offset by increased purchased power costs. Fuel costs, which include coal, gas, oil and emission allowance costs, decreased by $20.9 million, or 6%, in 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 primarily due to lower generation output of 4% resulting from scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, as well as a 2% decrease in average fuel prices. Purchased power increased $128.2 million in 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 resulting from a $57.6 million increase in charges relating to higher purchased power volume and a $41.2 million increase due to higher average market rates. Also included in purchased power is a $28.4 million increase related largely to RTO ancillary charges for PJM capacity charges. The increase in purchased power volume was primarily the result of increased retail sales volume and partner operated generating facilities being less available compared to the prior year due to planned and unplanned outages.\u00a0 In addition, we purchase power when market prices are below the marginal costs associated with our higher cost generating facilities. The RTO ancillary charges for PJM capacity charges are substantially offset by RTO ancillary revenues for PJM capacity resulting in minimal impact to gross margin., 546252=In October\u00a02006, the FERC also approved new mandatory reliability standards which become effective in 2007, with requirements applying to certain assets and activities of DPL, DP&L and DPLE. \u00a0FERC subsequently has promulgated some revisions and additional reliability standards, including cyber-security standards.\u00a0 The new regulations include potential penalties for failure to comply with these standards.\u00a0 DPL, DP&L and DPLE are currently assessing and modifying compliance documents and procedures as needed.\u00a0 We are working with consultants, other utilities and other organizations to comply with the new mandatory standards and their compliance documentation requirements., 659446=In September\u00a02004, the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the Company and the other owners of the Stuart generating station in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio for alleged violations of the CAA, including issues similar to those presented in the Duke Energy case and other issues relating to alleged violations of opacity limitations. DP&L, on behalf of all co-owners, is leading the defense of this matter. A sizable amount of discovery has taken place and expert reports were filed at various times from May\u00a0through September, 2007. On February 14, 2008, upon the request of the Sierra Club, DP&L and the other owners of the Stuart generating station, the Court approved another sixty day stay of proceedings to permit the parties the opportunity to determine if a settlement of the case could be reached. Settlement negotiations are ongoing., 531881=As of December\u00a031, 2007, four unaffiliated marketers were registered as Competitive Retail Electric Service (CRES) providers in DP&L\u0092s service territory.\u00a0 While there has been some customer switching to date associated with unaffiliated marketers, it represented less than 0.15% of sales in 2007.\u00a0 DPLER, an affiliated company, is also a registered CRES provider and accounted for 99.3% of the total kWh supplied by CRES providers within DP&L\u0092s service territory in 2007.\u00a0 In addition, several communities in DP&L\u0092s service area have passed ordinances allowing the communities to become government aggregators for the purpose of offering alternative electric generation supplies to their citizens.\u00a0 To date, none of these communities have aggregated their generation load., 585576=In 2007, the Ohio EPA and the USEPA issued NOVs to DP&L for alleged violations of the CAA at the O.H. Hutchings Station.\u00a0 The NOVs alleged deficiencies relate to stack opacity and particulate emissions.\u00a0 Discussions are under way with the USEPA and Ohio EPA and DP&L has provided data to those agencies regarding its maintenance expenses and operating results.\u00a0 DP&L is unable to determine whether any additional actions will take place with respect to this matter., 261049=February\u00a02007, 606664=Customers can elect to take generation service from a CRES provider offering services to customers in DP&L\u0092s service territory.\u00a0 As of December\u00a031, 2007, five CRES providers have been certified by the PUCO to provide generation service to DP&L customers.\u00a0 One of those five, DPL Energy Resources,\u00a0Inc. (DPLER), is a wholly-owned affiliate of DPL.\u00a0 Although DPLER supplied 99.3% of the total kWh consumed by customers served by CRES providers in DP&L\u0092s service territory in 2007, at the end of 2007 there was a slight increase in the non-residential customers served by unaffiliated CRES providers.\u00a0 There has been no residential customer switching to date.\u00a0 Depending on the development of the wholesale market and the level of wholesale prices, CRES providers could become more active in DP&L\u0092s service territory and may begin to offer prices lower than DP&L\u0092s standard offer.\u00a0 This could result in more switching by DP&L\u0092s customers and a further loss of revenues by DP&L., 1022353=2006\u00a0vs.\u00a02005, 150953=For the fiscal year ended December\u00a031, 2007, 571222=On January\u00a05, 2005, the USEPA published its final non-attainment designations for the national ambient air quality standard for Fine Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5).\u00a0 These designations included counties and partial counties in which DP&L operates and/or owns generating facilities.\u00a0 On March\u00a04, 2005, DP&L and other Ohio electric utilities and electric generators filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the final rule\u00a0creating these designations.\u00a0 On November\u00a030, 2005, the court ordered USEPA to decide on all petitions for reconsideration by January\u00a020, 2006.\u00a0 On January\u00a020, 2006, USEPA denied the petitions for reconsideration.\u00a0 The court ordered a briefing schedule with final briefs due in July\u00a02008 and oral arguments to be scheduled for fall 2008.\u00a0 The Ohio EPA must submit regulations to attain and maintain compliance with the PM 2.5 national ambient air quality standard in April\u00a02008.\u00a0 DP&L cannot determine the outcome of the petition for review or the effect such Ohio EPA regulations will have on its operations., 936462=On September\u00a025, 2007, Senate Bill 221 was introduced in the Ohio Legislature.\u00a0 The bill codifies, in draft form, the governor\u0092s proposed energy policy.\u00a0 The bill was passed by the Senate on October\u00a031, 2007. The Ohio House of Representatives has assigned the bill to committee and is taking testimony from interested parties. As the bill is not yet in final form, the outcome of this proceeding and its financial impact on the Company cannot be determined at this time., 562234=On October\u00a027, 2003, the USEPA published final rules\u00a0regarding the equipment replacement provision (ERP) of the routine maintenance, repair and replacement (RMRR) exclusion of the CAA.\u00a0 Subsequently, on December\u00a024, 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stayed the effective date of the rule\u00a0pending its decision on the merits of the lawsuits filed by numerous states and environmental organizations challenging the final rules.\u00a0 As a result of the stay, the Ohio EPA delayed its previously announced intent to adopt the RMRR rule.\u00a0 On October\u00a020, 2005, USEPA proposed to revise the emissions test for existing electric generating units.\u00a0 At this time, we are unable to determine the impact of the ERP appeal or the outcome of the proposed emissions test., 619143=Annually, PJM performs a review of the capital additions required to provide reliable electric transmission services throughout its territory.\u00a0 PJM traditionally allocated the costs of constructing these facilities to those entities that benefited directly from the additions.\u00a0 On April\u00a019, 2007, the FERC issued an order that modified the traditional method of allocating costs associated with new high voltage planned transmission facilities.\u00a0 FERC ordered that the cost of new high-voltage facilities be socialized across the PJM region.\u00a0 The costs of the new facilities at lower voltages will continue to be assigned to the load centers that benefit from the new facilities.\u00a0 In a companion order also issued on April\u00a019, 2007, FERC did not change the existing allocation of costs associated with existing transmission facilities, upholding the existing PJM rate design.\u00a0 The overall impact of FERC\u0092s orders cannot be definitively assessed at this time because not all new planned construction is likely to happen.\u00a0 The additional costs allocated to the Company for new large transmission approved projects are expected to be immaterial in 2008 and 2009 but could rise to approximately $12 million or more annually by 2012.\u00a0 As a result, DP&L filed an application seeking PUCO authority to defer costs associated with these new high-voltage transmission projects for future recovery through retail rates., 642621=Our internal controls, accounting policies and practices, and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America, laws and regulations, taxation requirements and federal securities laws and regulations. We implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting rules\u00a0issued in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u0093Act\u0094). Our internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by management and our Board of Directors to ensure continued compliance with Section\u00a0404 of the Act. While we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees, temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to improprieties and undetected errors that could impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows., 264741=On May\u00a021, 2007, we settled the litigation with the three former executives in exchange for our payment of $25 million. The $25 million settlement was funded from the sale of financial assets held in DP&L\u0092s Master Trust for deferred compensation. As a result of this settlement, DPL realized a net pre-tax gain in continuing and discontinued operations of $31 million and $8.2 million, respectively. As part of this settlement, the three former executives relinquished and dismissed all their claims including those related to certain deferred compensation, restricted stock units (RSUs), MVE,\u00a0Inc.(discontinued subsidiary of DPL) incentives, stock options and legal fees. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements., 247576=DPL, DP&L, and its subsidiaries employed 1,562 persons as of January\u00a031,\u00a02008, of which 1,333 were full-time employees and 229 were part-time employees.\u00a0 Approximately 54% of our employees are under a collective bargaining agreement.\u00a0 During the third quarter of 2008, we will begin negotiation discussions with employees covered under our collective bargaining agreement which is set to expire in November\u00a02008.\u00a0 If the collective bargaining agreement expires before a new agreement is reached, we would attempt to persuade our employees to continue working while negotiations continue.\u00a0 We believe that we maintain a satisfactory relationship with our employees; however, it is possible that the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement could result in labor disruptions affecting some or all of our operations., 523957=Since January\u00a02001, DP&L\u0092s electric customers have been permitted to choose their retail electric generation supplier.\u00a0 DP&L continues to have the exclusive right to provide delivery service in its state certified territory and the obligation to supply retail generation service to customers that do not choose an alternative supplier.\u00a0 The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over DP&L\u0092s delivery of electricity, standard service offer, and other retail electric services., 582327=In December\u00a02007, the Ohio EPA issued a NOV to DP&L-operated Killen generating station (co-owned by DP&L and CG&E) for alleged violations of the CAA.\u00a0 The NOVs alleged deficiencies in the continuous monitoring of opacity.\u00a0 A compliance plan has been submitted to the Ohio EPA.\u00a0 To date, no further actions have been taken by the Ohio EPA., 274184=2006, 924544=(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the fourth quarter of 2006, DPL entered into agreements to sell two of its peaking facilities resulting in a $44.2 million ($71 million pre-tax) impairment charge. The sale was finalized in April\u00a02007. During 2006, DPL recorded a $37.3 million ($61.2 million pre-tax) charge for early redemption of debt. DP&L recorded a $2.5 million ($4.1 million pre-tax) charge for early redemption of debt. In May\u00a02007, DPL settled the litigation with the former executives resulting in a $19.7 million ($31 million pre-tax) gain. In April\u00a02007, DPL also recouped legal costs associated with the litigation with the former executives from one of its insurers resulting in a $9.2 million ($14.5 million pre-tax) gain., 574158=On April\u00a02, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned the rulings of two lower courts and concluded that the CAA\u0092s NSR requirements are triggered when a major physical or operational change at a facility results in an increase in the facility\u0092s annual emissions (Environmental Defense et al. v. Duke Energy Corp. et al.).\u00a0 The outcome of this case is significant to DP&L because it eliminates one of DP&L\u0092s major arguments in the lawsuit filed against it by the Sierra Club.\u00a0 The Court decided that an annual rate of emissions could be used to determine if major modifications have been made to a plant as opposed to an hourly emission, 159174=1065 Woodman Drive Dayton, Ohio 45432, 950822=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On November\u00a015, 2007, the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority (OAQDA) issued $90\u00a0million of OAQDA Revenue Bonds 2007 Series\u00a0A, due November\u00a02040.\u00a0 See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements., 541177=As a member of PJM, the value of DP&L\u0092s generation capacity is affected by changes in and the clearing results of the PJM capacity construct.\u00a0 The construct utilizes a Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) that changes the way generation capacity is priced and planned for by PJM. \u00a0PJM held its first RPM auction\u00a0during April\u00a02007 for the 2007/2008 planning year and held subsequent auctions during July\u00a0and October\u00a02007 and January\u00a02008.\u00a0 The results of these auctions have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\u00a0 The FERC decisions establishing RPM have been appealed by various entities to the Federal appeals court.\u00a0 RPM remains in effect pending the outcome of the appeal.\u00a0 DP&L has intervened and supports the FERC decisions., 583372=In 2006, DP&L detected a malfunction with its emission monitoring system at DP&L-operated Killen generating station (co-owned by DP&L and CG&E) and ultimately determined its SO2 and NOx emissions data were under reported.\u00a0 DP&L has petitioned the USEPA to accept an alternative methodology for calculating actual emissions for 2005 and the first quarter 2006.\u00a0 DP&L has sufficient allowances in its general account to cover the understatement and is working with the USEPA to resolve the matter.\u00a0 Management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material impact on results of operations, financial position or cash flows., 948604=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In July\u00a02007, DPL completed a depreciation rate study for non-regulated generation property based on its property, plant and equipment balances as of December\u00a031, 2005, with adjustments for subsequent scrubber additions. The results of the depreciation study concluded that DPL\u0092s depreciation rates should be reduced due to asset lives being extended beyond previously estimated lives. DPL adjusted the depreciation rates for its non-regulated generation property, effective August\u00a01, 2007, reducing depreciation expense. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2007, the reduction in depreciation expense increased income from continuing operations by $9.5 million, increased net income by approximately $6.0 million and increased basic EPS by approximately $0.06 per share. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements., 576555=In September\u00a02004, the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against us and the other owners of the Stuart generating station in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio for alleged violations of the CAA, including issues similar to those presented in the Duke Energy case and other issues relating to alleged violations of opacity limitations.\u00a0 DP&L, on behalf of all co-owners, is leading the defense of this matter.\u00a0 A sizable amount of discovery has taken place and expert reports were filed at various times from May\u00a0through September\u00a02007.\u00a0 On February 14, 2008, upon the request of the Sierra Club, DP&L and the other owners of the Stuart generating station, the Court approved another sixty day stay of proceedings to permit the parties the opportunity to determine if a settlement of the case could be reached.\u00a0 Settlement negotiations are ongoing., 563400=In a regulation proceeding relating to the same issue decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Duke Energy case discussed below, the USEPA issued a proposed rule\u00a0in October\u00a02005 concerning the test for measuring whether modifications to electric generating units should trigger application of New Source Review (NSR) standards under the CAA.\u00a0 The proposed rule\u00a0seeks comments on two different hourly emissions test options as well as the USEPA\u0092s current method of measuring previous actual emission levels to projected actual emission levels after the modification.\u00a0 A third option that tests emissions increase based upon emissions per unit of energy output is also available for comment.\u00a0 We cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking or its impact on current environmental litigation., 246784=Under the recently enacted Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requires that utility holding companies comply with certain accounting, record retention and filing requirements.\u00a0 DPL believes it is exempt from these requirements because DP&L\u0092s operations are confined to a single state.\u00a0 On January\u00a031, 2006, DPL filed a FERC 65B Waiver Notification, with the FERC, requesting that the FERC approve DPL\u0092s waiver and avoid FERC regulation., 684938=On December\u00a013, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a 6% dividend increase on DPL\u0092s common stock, raising the annual dividend on common shares from $1.04 per share to $1.10 per share. These dividends will be paid in each quarter during 2008., 580614=In June\u00a02000, the USEPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to DP&L-operated Stuart generating station (co-owned by DP&L, CG&E, and CSP) for alleged violations of the CAA.\u00a0 The NOV contained allegations consistent with NOVs and complaints that the USEPA had recently brought against numerous other coal-fired utilities in the Midwest.\u00a0 The NOV indicated the USEPA may (1)\u00a0issue an order requiring compliance with the requirements of the Ohio SIP or (2)\u00a0bring a civil action seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day for each violation.\u00a0 To date, neither action has been taken., 941915=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the year ended December\u00a031, 2007, DPL\u0092s basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.06 and $1.88, respectively, increased over the basic and dilutive EPS for the same period in 2006 by $0.82 and $0.73, respectively., 684459=On February\u00a01, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a 4% dividend increase on DPL\u0092s common stock, raising the annual dividend on common shares from $1.00 per share to $1.04 per share.
