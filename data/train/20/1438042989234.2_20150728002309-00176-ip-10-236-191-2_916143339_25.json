I get the same level of education any 4 year school would give at a much lower cost. Last year I spent less than $3,000 on tuition and it was all covered by financial aid except for a few books. Am enjoying being here MTC is a community college, and no one lives on campus, therefore one doesn't feel the same bond with fellow students and professors and much as they would living on campus. Don't worry though, one can get a lot of study done when NOT living on campus. Its all how you look at it. Am learning a lot Like any college, you get your good and bad classes and professors. But at tech the classes are small and you really get to know your fellow students and professors. Most of the professors I've had privilege to study under have been excellent! I feel like MTC has given everything I need and more for when I transfer to a larger 4 year school for my bachelor's. Login to rate or flag",
