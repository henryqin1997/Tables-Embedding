The basic functions of ubiquitin and the components of the ubiquitination pathway were elucidated in the early 1980s at the Technion by Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko, and Irwin Rose for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 2004.[10], 11814=Lysine 48-linked chains have been much-studied. They are the forms of chains that signal proteins to the proteasome, which destroys and recycles proteins.[8] This discovery won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2004.[10][11], 258232=Grynberg M, Jaroszewski L, Godzik A;, BMC Bioinformatics. 2003;4:46.: Domain analysis of the tubulin cofactor system: a model for tubulin folding and dimerization.
