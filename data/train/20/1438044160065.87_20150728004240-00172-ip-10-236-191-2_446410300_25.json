Countries with less than five banks with non-missing information in any year between 1994 and 2004 are excluded. With this sample of banks, averages for the relevant performance and income statement variables are computed. These indices by country and variable are used as the counterfactual to the target banks' profitability measures., 4066=The determinants of cross-border acquisitions are evaluated using 220 deals that took place between 1994 and 2003. I estimate a discrete choice model to test the factors that increase the probability of an international takeover. This study finds that the target banks' size, pre-acquisition profitability, and the level of concentration in the host country's banking sector are significant determinants of cross-border deals. For emerging economies, the level of financial intermediation also contributes to the likelihood of acquisitions of domestic banks by Multinational Banks (MNBs)., 1968=This paper uses a unique database that includes deal and bank balance sheet information for 220 cross-border acquisitions between 1994 and 2003 to analyze the characteristics and performance effects of international takeovers on target banks. A discrete choice estimation shows that banks are more likely to get acquired in a cross-border deal if they are large, bad performers, in a small country, and when the banking sector is concentrated. Post-acquisition performance for target banks does not improve in the first two years relative to domestically-owned financial institutions. This result is explained by a decrease in the banks' net interest margin in developed countries and an increase in overhead costs in emerging economies., 118369=The empirical model in equation (1) has been estimated using a probit specification. The dependent variable equals one if a bank is acquired by a foreign institution in year and zero otherwise. The model is explained in section 2.1; the sample is defined in section 3.1. The model is estimated for the 1994-2003 period. Columns (1) through (6) differ in the performance proxy included. In columns (1) and (3) profitability is measured by the Return on Average Assets (ROA). Columns (2) and (5) include the Return on Average Equity (ROE). In columns (3) and (6) performance is defined as the Cost to Income Ratio. Columns (4) to (6) include Financial Development proxies in addition to the variables included in the first three columns. All estimations include time fixed effects., 11654=Another group of studies uses accounting data to asses the effect of M&As on operating performance. Chamberlain (1998) analyzes a sample of deals that took place in the U.S. in the 1980s and finds that these transactions did not yield any operating efficiencies. This result is consistent with similar evidence that shows no improvements in Return on Assets (ROA) or growth in operating income in the same time period (Linder and Crane 1992). A limited number of studies show positive changes in performance after M&A deals in 1980s, for instance, Cornett and Tehranian (1992) find an increase in the post-acquisition Return on Equity (ROE) and operating cash flow, but the authors focus only on 30 mergers between 1982 and 1987. In the 1990s, the observed post-acquisition performance of institutions involved in M&A deals improved on average. Technological changes and the deregulation of national branching by financial institutions are suggested as possible explanations for this difference in the post-acquisition performance of merged institutions (Cornett, McNutt, and Tehranian 2006; Berger, Demsetz, and Strahan 1999)., 36053=Two bank samples were constructed to estimate the regressions described in the previous section. The first one includes all financial institutions classified as Commercial Banks in Bankscope between 1994 and 2003 (3295) that have at least one cross-border deal in the sample period.17 Table 1 shows the distribution of banks across countries. A large percentage of the sample is represented by financial institutions from the United States (27.3%), Germany (5.5%) and France (5.3%). Amongst emerging economies, Brazil (2.9%), Argentina (2%), and Panama (1.8%) have the largest shares.18 The second sample is limited to a group of banks acquired in cross-border transactions., 115694=To estimate the regressions in section 2.3, I relax the restriction of having at least two years of information before and two years after the deal to one year before and one year after. This change increases the sample to 132 cross-border deals for the period between 1994 and 2003., 141076=The results on the performance variables could be explained, as in Vander Vennet (2002), by the expected comparative advantage of international banks in managing large financial institutions. Better technology, geographical diversification, and management skills are factors that may induce MNBs to acquire targets of considerable importance in local market where they could exert some market power and turn around the profitability ratios. The result on the relation between bank concentration and the probability of a cross-border deal differs from the evidence found in Focarelli and Pozzolo (2005). These authors find that this variable has a negative effect on cross-border bank entry using a sample of OECD countries. Nevertheless, their results only apply to the distribution of cross-border holdings of OECD banks in 1998, rather than a dynamic analysis of entry across years., 83341=Deal data is from Zephyr, SDC and the banks' webpages.

The methodology is explained in section 2.2; variables are defined in section 3. The sample includes 102 deals with at least two pre and post-acquisition years.

The Sign Test statistically evaluates the null hypothesis of a median equal to zero for the difference-in-difference measure. Frac>0 is the fraction of deals with positive Targ-Ind values. The Wilcoxon Test evaluates the hypothesis that two independent samples (i.e., unmatched data) are from populations with the same distribution. The Median Test evaluates the null hypothesis that the samples of developed and emerging country deals were drawn from populations with the same median., 294802=Focarelli, Dario, and Alberto Pozzolo (2005) Where Do Banks Expand Abroad?

The regressions include deal and country fixed effects., 28743=Finally, to answer the question about the differences in post-acquisition performance by targets depending on the level of the development of the host country, I divide the sample between targets located in emerging countries and those in developed economies. Following Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2001), a bank is defined as being located in a developed country, if GDP per capita in the host-country is above 10,000 dollars (2000 U.S. dollars). Then, performance and other income indicators are compared using the Sign Test, Wilcoxon Test, and the Median Test., 111936=For the performance estimations described in section 2.2, I restrict the sample to banks with at least two years of information before a cross-border acquisition and two years after.21 This creates a sample of 102 deals shown in the last two columns of Table 1. A significant share of targets is located in Germany (7.8%), Belgium (5.9%), Brazil (5.9%), Poland (6.9%), and the United States (5.9%). The share of Argentinean (1%) banks in this sample decreases relative to the full set of deals in this country due to missing and outlier observations attributed to the banking crisis in 2001. Panel B in Table 2 shows that most of the acquirers are based in Western European countries (84). Financial institutions in Western Europe are mostly involved in deals within the region (33) or in Eastern European (25) and Latin American (17) countries., 81842=To construct the first sample, the Bankscope dataset is matched to an M&A database, which is comprised of information for all cross-border acquisitions between 1994 and 2003.19 This paper requires two conditions for a deal to be defined as a cross-border acquisition: first, the transaction has to give the acquiring bank a majority stake (more than 50%) in the target bank, provided that it previously held either no shares or a minority stockholding in the target. Additionally, the headquarters of the target bank has to be located in a country different from the home-country of the ultimate parent of the acquirer. The result is 328 deals matched to Bankscope., 34297=To estimate the models defined in the previous section, I construct a sample of banks involved in cross-border deals between 1994 and 2003. For this purpose, two databases are matched: the first one includes bank financial data and the second has information on cross-border acquisitions. Data on banks' financial statements is collected from the Bankscope database maintained by Bureau van Dijk. This dataset contains annual statements for listed and unlisted banks in 179 countries starting at the beginning of the 1990s. For M&A information, I use the Zephyr database from Bureau van Dijk, the SDC Platinum database from Thompson Financial Securities Data, and individual bank webpages., 306112=21.\u00a0\u00a0For these estimations I use bank data from 1994 to 2004.\u00a0Return to text, 313=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers Number 922, March 2008 --- Screen Reader Version*, 296646=Milbourn, Todd T., Arnoud W.

Table 11A:\u00a0\u00a0Costs, revenue, economic integration and information costs Lastly, Tables 11A and 11B use the same estimating equation to determine the factors that influence revenue and cost items for targets. In all estimations, but the ones including Non-interest Income and Net Interest Margins in developed countries, the coefficient on the time-event dummies are negative. Acquired banks have higher Net Interest Margins if the host and home countries are similar in terms of GDP per capita, especially when the host is located in an emerging country (column (4), Table 11B). Overhead costs are lower in the post-acquisition period if the countries share the same language or are located in the same region. The opposite result is true if they share the same legal origin. These results are influenced by deals within Western Europe. In emerging economies bank concentration reduces the incentive for target to decrease these costs as shown in Table 11B, column (5).
