A majority of Latinos, on the other hand, actually stepped up their gang involvement as adults, while also selling drugs. Nearly all whites stopped their gang involvement, but most had sold drugs.\u00a0 Note that while white male gang members used cocaine at roughly the same levels as minority gang members, more than two thirds were working legitimate jobs, while only about a quarter of African Americans and Latinos held such jobs.\u00a0 Licit jobs hadn't disappeared for these working class whites. Almost all told us they found jobs by utilizing relatives to get them into jobs in remaining area factories. What happened to",
