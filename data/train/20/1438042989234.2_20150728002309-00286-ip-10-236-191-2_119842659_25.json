Data collected using the two different birth certificate revisions are not comparable; therefore the Report Card does not grade or rank the states for this indicator. Data for 17 states--Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wyoming--is based on the 2003 Revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. Data for the remaining the remaining 33 states and the District of Columbia is based on the 1989 Revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. Comparison data is shown in the 2007 column only for the states which continue to use the 1989 revision., 156722=2 The definition of binge drinking among women used by the Behavioral Risk Fact Surveillance System (BRFSS: the Report Card\u2019s data source for this indicator) from 2000 to 2005 was five or more drinks per occasion and was modified in 2006 to be four or more drinks per occasion. The apparent change in the prevalence of binge drinking between 2000 and 2010 among women may be related, in part, to this change in definition. Note that the same Healthy People 2010 benchmark (to reduce the prevalence of binge drinking, with no definition specified, to 6%) is used to determine grades for binge drinking in the 2004, 2007, and 2010 Report Cards., 157402=3 Because more current data are not available, the data from the 2007 Report Card have not been updated and are not shown in the 2007 column.}",
