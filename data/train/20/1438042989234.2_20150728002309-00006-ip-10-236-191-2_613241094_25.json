            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights.",
            "These data were collected using a SHOALS-1000T system. It is owned and operated by Fugro Pelagos performing contract survey services for the US Army Corps of Engineers. The system collects topographic lidar data at 10kHz and hydrographic data at 1kHz. The system also collects RGB imagery at 1Hz. Aircraft position, velocity and acceleration information are collected through a combination of Novatel and POS A/V equipment. Raw data are collected and transferred to the office for downloading and processing in SHOALS GCS software. GPS data are processed using POSPac software and the results are combined with the lidar data to produce 3-D positions for each lidar shot. These data are edited using Fledermaus software where anomalous data are removed from the dataset. The edited data are unloaded from SHOALS GCS, converted from ellipsoid to orthometric heights, based on the GEOID03 model, and split into greographic tiles covering approximately 5km each.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received files in ascii format. The files contained lidar intensity and elevation measurements. CSC performed the following processing on the data to make it available within the Lidar Data Retrieval Tool (LDART): 1. Each hydro/topo last return ascii file was converted to las files. Default values for which there is no corresponding input were assigned as follows for each las elevation data record: intensity = 0, retn = 1, nret = 1, class = 0 2. The las files were sorted by latitude and the las header fields were updated."
