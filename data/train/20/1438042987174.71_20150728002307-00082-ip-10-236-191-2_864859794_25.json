Sasha Fierce. Beyonc\u00e9 first promoted \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" in a concert organized by the Power 105.1 radio station on October 29, 2008.[43] Beyonc\u00e9 first performed \"If I Were a Boy\" on November 6, 2008, at the MTV Europe Music Awards.[44] She later sang \"Single Ladies\" on November 9, 2008, at the 2008 World Music Awards in Monaco. She then took to the stage of The Oprah Winfrey Show to perform \"If I Were a Boy\" on November 13, 2008.[45] She appeared on television show Saturday Night Live (SNL) on November 15, 2008, where she sang \"Single Ladies\".[46] On November 16, 2008, Beyonc\u00e9 sang a medley of \"If I Were a Boy\", \"Single Ladies\", and \"Crazy in Love\" during the final episode of Total Request Live.[47] \"Single Ladies\" was also performed by Beyonc\u00e9 on November 18, 2008, at BET's 106 & Park,[48] at the 2008 American Music Awards on November 23, 2008, on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on November 25, 2008,[49] on The Today Show the following day,[50] and on The Tyra Banks Show with two male dancers, on January 9, 2009.[51] Beyonc\u00e9's first live performance of \"Halo\" was at the 2009 NAACP Awards on February 12, 2009.[52] She later performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman after an interview on April 22, 2009.[53] Beyonc\u00e9 was due to perform \"Sweet Dreams\" at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13;[54] however, she only performed the bridge from the song at the beginning of her performance, before switching to \"Single Ladies\".[55] She later performed \"Sweet Dreams\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards on November 5, 2009.[56] She performed \"If I Were a Boy\" on January 31, 2010, at the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony and also covered Alanis Morissette's 1995 song \"You Oughta Know\" on the same event.[57], 27734=In an interview for Billboard magazine, Beyonc\u00e9 described I Am... Sasha Fierce as a double album. She said, \"One side has songs that are more mainstream and another has my more traditional R&B songs for my fans who've been there the whole time. Some of it sounds like Barbra Streisand, Karen Carpenter and The Beatles around the 1970s.\"[11] Music writer Andy Kellman of Allmusic viewed its first disc as, \"essentially a small set of adult contemporary ballads. Acoustic guitars, pianos, strings, contemplative soul searching, and grand sweeping gestures fill it out, with more roots in '[19]70s soft rock than soul.\"[12] The second disc, Sasha Fierce, contains consistent electro influences, which are displayed in songs like \"Radio\" and \"Sweet Dreams\".[13] Kellman said in his review that \"Diva\" resembles B'Day's \"Freakum Dress\" or \"Ring the Alarm\" in terms of audacity.[12] Despite being on the Sasha Fierce disc, \"Ego\", \"Why Don't You Love Me\" and \"Scared of Lonely\" were noted to be a meeting ground between the album's halves. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, they resemble Sasha Fierce musically, but thematically and lyrically, they are vulnerable like Beyonc\u00e9 on the I Am... disc.[9] The album formally introduces Beyonc\u00e9's alter ego Sasha Fierce. She revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her 2003 hit single \"Crazy in Love\".

Sasha Fierce is the third studio album by American recording artist Beyonc\u00e9. It was released on November 15, 2008, by Music World Entertainment and Columbia Records. In its initial release, the album was formatted as a dual disc, intending to market Beyonc\u00e9's contrasting facets of artistry. The first disc, I Am..., contains slow and midtempo pop and R&B ballads, while the second, Sasha Fierce (named after Beyonc\u00e9's on-stage alter ego), focuses on more uptempo beats that blend electropop and Europop genres. In composing the songs' lyrics, Beyonc\u00e9 worked with many writers, with each session accompanied by live orchestration., 52967=To promote the album, Beyonc\u00e9 embarked on a worldwide tour with several performance.

Yours residency at the Encore Theater in Las Vegas was recorded on August 2, 2009, and later released as a DVD, audio CD and television special in late November 2009 titled I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas.[60] Various performances on the tour were filmed worldwide for a live DVD, I Am... World Tour, which was released on November 30, 2010.[61], 60969=Following announcements of the I Am...

Sasha Fierce with a music video and digital download release, taking form as an extended remix featuring American recording artist, Lady Gaga. Like its predecessor, it reached the top-forty in countries around the world, peaking at number sixty-five in the US.[63] It also became Beyonc\u00e9's fourteenth number-one on the US Dance Club Chart.[72] As of July 2010, the digital tracks from the album had sold a combined total of 12.3\u00a0million units in the United States;[73] and according to Columbia Records the album has sold 15\u00a0million digital singles worldwide.[74], 13938=The album spawned several singles; some served as international and stateside releases, while others were purely for promotional purposes. The two lead singles from I Am... Sasha Fierce, \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", both charted highly internationally. The former topped the charts in over eight countries and reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100, with the latter becoming her fifth number one single on the Hot 100 chart. \"Diva\" and \"Ego\" were released as US-only singles, while \"Halo\" and \"Sweet Dreams\" were promoted internationally as the third and fourth singles respectively. \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" was released internationally as the fifth single, while \"Video Phone\" was released in November 2009 and \"Why Don't You Love Me\" was released in July 2010., 87316=I Am...

Sasha Fierce was also nominated for Best Album.[102] At the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, Beyonc\u00e9 was recognized as the Best Female Artist and \"Single Ladies\" won Best Video accolade with \"Halo\" the winner in the Best Song category.[103], 85015=Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly ranked I Am\u2026\u00a0Sasha Fierce at number two on her list of the 10 Best Albums of 2008, stating that \"'If I Were a Boy' and 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)' are undoubtedly album highlights; still, the surprise here is how consistently satisfying the rest of it is \u2013 even the less showy tracks blossom on repeated listening.\"[88] Mark Edward Nero of About.com ranked it at the ninth place on his list of the Best R&B Albums of 2008.[89] Christian Gerard of NBC Washington placed I Am... Sasha Fierce on his list of \"Honorable Mentions\" while writing the list for the Best Albums of 2008.[90] Agence France-Presse, as reported by ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs, recognized the album as the twelfth best selling one of 2008.[91] On The Village Voice\u200d\u200a'\u200b Pazz & Jop year-end lists, I Am... Sasha Fierce was ranked at numbers 333 and 580 in 2008 and 2009 respectively.[92][93] The album was ranked number twelve on the list of Best Albums of the Decade in Rolling Stone\u200d\u200a'\u200bs Reader's Poll.[94] The writers of Entertainment Weekly ranked I Am... Sasha Fierce at number eight on their list of The Best Albums of The 2000s.[95], 31697=\"If I Were a Boy\", the first single of I Am..., stands as the only song on either disc that Beyonc\u00e9 did not co-write. BC Jean, who wrote most of the song's lyrics, took inspiration from the product of a poor relationship.[15] Beyonc\u00e9 explained in Essence Magazine that \"If I Were a Boy\" is different from her previous songs in the sense that it is not a traditional R&B song. Music critics remarked that the song seemed to be a mixture of Beyonc\u00e9's 2006 hit \"Irreplaceable\", Fergie's 2007 single \"Big Girls Don't Cry\", and Ciara's 2007 single \"Like a Boy\".[16] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times saw the song's theme of female empowerment as an expansion on that of \"Irreplaceable\".[13] Musically, \"Single Ladies\" is an upbeat-dance-pop and R&B song,[17] and features dancehall and bounce influences.[18] According to Jonah Weiner of Blender, the song makes a clear reference to marriage[19] while Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that the lyrics had a connection with \"post-breakup\".[20] \"Halo\", composed by Ryan Tedder and Evan Bogart, was initially intended for Beyonc\u00e9 but was almost recorded by Leona Lewis due to Beyonc\u00e9's schedule.[21] According to Christian Williams of Billboard, \"Halo\" has a mainstream pop sound, with subtle R&B undertones.[22] Critics noted \"Diva\" as a variation on Lil Wayne's \"A Milli\" and coined it as its female counterpart. \"Diva\" carries a stuttering beat.[23] \"Sweet Dreams\" was critically acclaimed for its use of electronic bassline, which some critics compared to Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\",[24] and for its electropop sound.[25] \"Sweet Dreams\" is derived from contemporary R&B and incorporates influences from the classic 1980s funk.[26] \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" is a midtempo piano ballad.[26] Its production and melody is backed by strings and a drum machine beat.[27] According to Spence D. of IGN Music, \"Hello\" comes off like another ballad that \"populate[s] the first part of the album.\"[28] It contains the Jerry Maguire line \u2013 \"You had me at hello\" \u2013 as part of its chorus. It essentially consists of \"sweet guitar-picking and delicate harmonies.\"[29] According to critics, \"Video Phone\" contains lyrics that are in reference to \"a celebration of Skype sex and putting on a solo show, on camera, for a guy you just met at the club\".[30] The remixed version featured both Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga trading verses with one another.[31] Musically the song consists of simple lyrics, with hidden innuendos, and is backed by thin-spread beats; Beyonc\u00e9 and Gaga uttering gasps and groans while singing the song.[32] \"Disappear\" consists of \"sweet guitar-picking and delicate harmonies\".[29] \"That's Why You're Beautiful\" is a slow-tempo soft rock[25] and rock[33] power ballad, which consists of a \"grungy\" guitar riff and stuterring drums.[9] Critics compared the song with the materials by Alice in Chains and Jill Scott.[9] The platinum edition of the album also included a cover version by Beyonc\u00e9 of the 1979 Billy Joel song \"Honesty\".[10], 90275=I Am... Sasha Fierce was nominated for the Outstanding Album award at the 2009 NAACP Image Award,[104] and for International Album of the Year at the 2010 NRJ Music Award.[105] At the 2010 OVMA World Awards, Beyonc\u00e9 won Artist of the Year as well as Best R&B Artist, however, the album lost in the category Album of the Year.[106] Beyonc\u00e9 was also nominated for Favorite Female Artist and for Favorite R&B Artist at the 36th People's Choice Awards[107] as well as at the 2010 Teen Choice Awards,[108] and in the categories World's Best R&B Artist and World's Best Pop Artist at the 2010 World Music Awards.[109] I Am... Sasha Fierce and its singles earned Beyonc\u00e9 seven Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year. She won record-setting 6 Grammy awards out of the seven\u2014which of this album, plus the award for \"At Last\" from the Cadillac Records's soundtrack she is the most awards won by a female artist in one night.[110]}",
