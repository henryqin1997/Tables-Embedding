Harrington has struggled most of 2005 and hasn\u2019t been the answer at quarterback the Lions organization had expected., 55594=The Chiefs defense has given up at 27 points in each of its last five games and that\u2019s a big concern with a veteran team that may quit down the stretch. KC hasn\u2019t won the turnover battle once since their first game with Denver and their ball control offense that can march up and down the field has not been able to translate that yardage into points the last four games. The Chiefs have been in each of those contests but have found a way to lose each game., 16057=Each team has played Cleveland and Dallas in the last month. The Bengals beat both teams: they beat the Browns 58-48 in a barn-burner last Sunday and beat the Cowboys 26-3 on 11/7/2004. Both games were played in Cincinnati. The Ravens beat Cleveland 27-13 on 11/7/2004 and beat the Cowboys 31-10. Both of those games were home contests as well. Not great wins for either team, but all the victories were comfortable and by ten points or more.}",
