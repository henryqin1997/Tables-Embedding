    "textBeforeTable": "Jon Stahl, Maynard, MA US 12-03-2009 Ankle stress relief device - A novel ankle gapping device includes a lower leg engaging apparatus, a foot engaging apparatus, and a biasing member disposed between the lower leg engaging apparatus and the foot engaging apparatus. The leg engaging apparatus is adapted to securely engage a user's leg such that the leg engaging apparatus will remain stationary when the biasing member exerts an upward force thereon. The foot engaging apparatus is contoured to fit the user's foot. In a particular embodiment, the biasing member is a pneumatic biasing member, such as an inflatable tube that is actuated by a pump. As the pump provides compressed air (or some other fluid) to the biasing member, the pressure inside the biasing member increases, causing an increase in the volume of the biasing member. This pressure and volume increase exerts an upward force via the leg engaging apparatus to the lower leg, and a downward force via the foot engaging apparatus to the foot. The forces applied to the leg and the foot cause separation of the ankle joint, allowing the synovial fluid to flow over the articulating surfaces of the bones of the joint. 20090299246 Published Description Patent application number John D.

Stahl, Needham, MA US Patent application number Description Published 20120277925 Queuing access to a shared power supply - A method of queuing access to a power supply shared by a set of electrical access points. The access points turn on independently from one another and thus have independent power draws. Each access point has a specific power draw when on. The on state and associated power draw of each of access point is identified, and a load duration curve for each access point is normalized (i.e., combined with load duration curve(s)) from the other access points) into a probability distribution function. The probability distribution function is a normalized load duration curve that thus accounts for a varying set of \u201coperating states\u201d that may occur with respect to the set of access points (when viewed collectively). Each operating state has an associated probability of occurrence. As the operating state of the set (of access points) changes, access to the power supply is selectively queued, or de-queued (if previously queued). 11-01-2012 20140350744 Queuing access to a shared power supply - A method of queuing access to a power supply shared by a set of electrical access points.
