It is contemplated that various substitutions, alterations and/or modifications to the embodiment of the invention disclosed herein, including but not limited to those implementation options specifically noted herein, may be made to the invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. The following language elements are not supported when running a VARPG applet and will result in Java errors at run time: Printer files, Local files, Calling C functions, external subprocedures, EXEs. NOMAIN and EXE applications cannot be run as applets. Positioning a host file to Null-Valued Records when ALWNULL(*NO) has been specified results in CPF5035. If an error occurs while a subprocedure in a NOMAIN or EXE application is being executed, and there is no error indicator or error operation code extender, or *PSSR, then the error will be reported back to the caller and handled by the caller. When running under Windows, the application would terminate. Integer overflow/underflow will not be reported. Float overflow/underflow will be reported as status 9999.
