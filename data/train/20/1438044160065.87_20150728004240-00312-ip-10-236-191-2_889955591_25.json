            "The campus is small and that makes getting around pretty easy. Campus security patrols the parking lots continuously. Most parking lots are well lit. The college does a great job of notifying students if their is a safety risk on campus.",
            "There are no Greek life clubs at this time. I did recently receive an email about possibly starting a chapter at the campus.",
            "There are far and few clubs and activities.",
            "Rhodes State College is great for a student who does not want to live on campus, or has children. The college would also be great for adults who work full time during the day. The college offers night classes in a wide variety of programs.",
            "The college started a easter egg hunt for students this year. They hid eggs with prizes all over campus and students randomly found them as they walked to and from classes.",
            "The college is very cost effective but you get what you pay for. The tuition is very low compared to other colleges in the area. It is a great way to start your education with out going into serious debt. The downfall is with lower tuition comes less services for the students. There are few extra curricular activities, student housing, and food options on campus. Also, computer access is very limited.",
            "Rhodes State College has a small game room in one of the buildings. There is also a gymnasium and the students have access to exercise equipment.",
            "The cafeteria offers great food. The only downfall is the cafeteria is only open for limited hours and its not open at all during the summer.",
            "Rhodes State College does not offer dorms. There is a shared living apartment option with very limited space.",
            "There is a wide variety of programs offered.",
            "This is a great school to start your college education. The cost of tuition is low compared to other schools in the area. If you are looking to transfer to a four year program most local colleges accept the credits from Rhodes State.",
            "At Rhodes State College is a cost effective school for students looking to obtain an associates degree. The college lacks in housing, sports programs, and other extra curricular activities. The school does offer a wide variety of educational programs."
