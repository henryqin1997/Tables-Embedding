As daunting as this figure may look, Pacific does offer good \u201cbang for the buck\u201d. I have found that the books and supplies estimate is much higher than the actual cost, as long as you are frugal. Also, Pacific offers many scholarship opportunities, including merit based scholarships, competitive academic scholarships, special interest scholarships, and need based scholarships. These scholarships can cover a large part of the tuition. For example the honors merit scholarship is worth $12,000 per year. This year, I received a scholarship from Pacific, which I hadn\u2019t even applied for. I believe the schooling at Pacific is of much higher quality than many other less expensive schools. The student to faculty ratio is 13:1. This enables you to develop relationships with teachers who know you by name and are willing to spend extra time to help you understand a subject or further pursue an interest. Each of these things add value to the educational experience offered at Pacific University. I believe the quality of the education is worth the cost, as long as you are willing to work hard and have education as a top priority., 8569=The teacher to student rate is 1:19 . It is a private school and the average graduation percentage is 71% !}",

Reviewer has not been to campus. 3 out of 7 people found this review useful. 2 of 54 Categories Comments Great for these types of students The school is quite diverse and I heard that there is a strong Hawaiian influence in the college. Any one would feel welcome here. Its a tight net community and its truly welcoming. Tips for prospective students Come visit the school or talk to an admissions counselor. It wont hurt to check the college out. Bang for the buck Everyone knows that Private schools are known for their academic excellence and sure it can cost a little more, but wouldn't you want to have a higher chance of succeeding? Will enjoy being here The area is beautiful . It is also 60 miles away from the Oregon coast and 80 miles away from Mt. Hood. Will learn a lot The teacher to student rate",
