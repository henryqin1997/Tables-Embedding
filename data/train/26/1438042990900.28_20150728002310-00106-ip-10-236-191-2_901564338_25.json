    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Olivet is a well rounded school that fits so many different types of people. It is great for those who have grown up in the Church and want to continue to surround themselves with those of similar beliefs. It is also a great school for those who are looking for something more to do with their lives. Education with a Christian Purpose really exemplifies what you can get out of ONU. I am learning how to lead a life that mirrors what I believe. Tips for prospective students On a small campus like ONU, it is not hard to get involved in some way or another. The first week has a lot of opportunities with everything involved in Ollies Follies and JumpStart. It is also easy to find a group of friends at the beginning of the year and narrow yourself too much. My advice is to get to know as many different people as you can freshman year. College can be a fresh start and no one has to fit into any stereotype that they might have had in high school. Put yourself out there and you will make so many amazing friends. Bang for the buck Olivet is fairly expensive compared to state universities. I am responsible",
