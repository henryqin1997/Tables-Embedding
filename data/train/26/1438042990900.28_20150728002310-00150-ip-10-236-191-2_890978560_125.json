            "There is a nighttime bus service that is willing to take you back to your dorm, and there are lots of emergency phones around.",
            "Greek life is huge, but it isn't a big deal if you don't rush.",
            "There are so many, but there is a skydiving club (the Miami Dropouts) and you can even make your own club if Miami doesn't currently have it.",
            "Willing to be academically challenged, open minded, engaging individuals fit in well here.",
            "People who kiss under the Upham Arch at midnight are destined to be Miami Mergers (Miami students who end up getting married). Also, Miami's hockey student cheer section has lots of special cheers, rituals, and traditions.",
            "You can hang out with friends, go Uptown (to Oxford), go to campus fests, go to movie nights, do things with your dorm, go to hockey games, learn to ice skate, and go hiking.",
            "Miami's food options are delicious. The meal plans are declining balances that you can spend at the buffets or a la carte locations. The buffets are a great value if you're planning on getting a full meal.",
            "Dorm life is great! I've made so many friends in my dorm and everyone is nice. Miami can be kind of strict during exam week with its 24 hour quiet hours policy, though.",
            "The classes are challenging but stimulating. Professors will make you write papers and think about things (instead of requiring that you know the answer). You will probably have to study a lot more than in high school.",
            "I would definitely bring rain boots (regardless of where you go to school in this area). Keep an open mind to opportunities and explore new things. Don't be afraid to stand out.",
            "Miami University is a beautiful Midwestern school where you can get a great education from very helpful professors. We have great traditions here, like hockey, formal spring rush, and weekly movie showings. There are so many opportunities you can take advantage of, like research and internships, and the food's great, too!"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{399283=Green Beer Day during the first week of March., 47589=Being at Miami, I have learned more than I expected. One reason being that every student is required to take Miami Plan courses, which contribute to Miami's liberal style of education. Not only have I learned more in college than I did high school, but the Miami Plan allows me to take a variety of different classes and learn things that I would not normally learn if I were to take classes that only pertained to my major/minor. For example, I took a southeast Asian art class fall semester 2010 and ended up learning about the different styles of art and along with the religions that go with them: Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. The second reason for my increased knowledge is quality of teaching that Miami provides. U.S. News rated Miami #2 in undergraduate teaching, meaning that the professors compare to those of some of the most prestigious schools in the country. In my experiences, the professors are a fantastic resource because they really focus on making sure that the students understand the information provided to them. Thus, I have been able to learn more in my classes and I feel vastly more educated than I did a year ago as a result of my professors being a great resource. What I love about Miami is how education can roll outside of the classroom. Miami offers undergraduate research, which is a very rare opportunity in undergraduate education. There are also seminars and guest speakers that visit Miami all the time. This past year, the Dalai Lama visited and spoke to students and other guests, which was extremely educational because I was able to learn things from a religious leader's perspective., 768648=On campus are various seals that you can NEVER step on or fail your exams, there is a sundial in the center of campus that you're supposed to rub before your exams to ensure you ace them, but the best (and maybe cutest) of all is the famous arch. On valentines day especially, it is said that if you kiss someone under the Upham Hall archway then you two will be happily in love forever. Needless to say, there is always a line there on February 14th. Then there is a somewhat shocking reality on campus, the sport of choice here is not football, basketball or the usual high school stars--it's hockey. Nationally ranked nearly every year, Miami Hockey is a very, very big deal. Every student waits in line for days before each home game to get tickets and cheer on the Redhawks., 445101=Being that it's an old school, Miami has many traditions. 1809, remember that. That's the year Miami was founded. Commit it to memory. DO NOT STEP ON THE SEAL. It doesn't matter if you fail your next exam or not. It's a matter of respect. So just don't. If you've found love at this school (and you might since our marriage rate is 33%) make sure to give your sweetheart a kiss under the Upham Arch at midnight and you'll be sure to tie the knot. Oh, and if your a male student living in Peabody Hall, watch out for Helen Peabody, or rather her ghost, she's not a fan of guys., 494559=If you want to know where you will be living prior to three weeks before move-in, I would suggest finding a roommate and not going random because they won't give out random roommates until the end of July., 819004=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 677076=Overall, the food is good, but by the end of second semester you never want to eat it again. Try the salads at Dividends in the Farmer School of Business-- they are my favorite! Also, Bell Tower and 1809 are good places to eat on campus with the meal plan! I try to avoid the all you can eat dining halls as much as possible., 504045=Our school was established in 1809, so there are many traditions on this campus. Take a tour, or look on the website to look at all the cool history we have.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The students here are very friendly, fun, and easy to get along with. There are a wide range of students activities and clubs, so it is easy to find something that caters to your interests. Oxford is a small town setting, but it is an ideal college town, if that is what you are looking for. The campus itself is very beautiful. Am learning a lot In my experience, the professors at Miami are passionate about their topics and really want the students to do well. Professors are readily available outside of class and eager to help the student learn. Students are heavily encouraged to be more than just students. Although the curriculum is challenging, it opened my mind to new ideas, concepts, and perspectives.
