            "The campus safety is good for the most part. I haven't seen any problems with it so far. Barton College is located in the best part of town, but they do hold meetings that remind students of the dangers they could be faced with at any college. We do have campus police officers walking around at all times. These officers also serve as escorts if you need one. The school provides a card with the emergency numbers on it and there are emergency call boxes all over campus.",

            "There are many things to do for fun here at Barton College. They often hold many activities on center campus during the day like corn hole and inflatable slides etc. They always have something for the students do. Also, they hold activities like bingo and other games.",
            "The food here is really good. They provide a nice variety of foods every day. The dining area is great for socialization as well. It is a big wide open space right on top of the student center. Once you are done eating, you can take the elevator down to enjoy some games of pool or ping pong or just relax and watch some television.",
            "The dorm life is also great here. They always keep the dorms looking nice and they keep students in line by having Resident Assistances around. If you have any kind of problem with people being loud or drinking or anything, all you have to do is report it to a Resident Assistance and they will take care of the problem. You dont have to worry about a thing!",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Students who are looking for a small campus, small class sizes, and person attention will enjoy and get the most out of Barton College. Tips for prospective students If a student is looking for a small campus with a family feel, where everyone knows each other by first name then Barton College is the place to be. The staff constantly wants feedback to make the college better for students and students always can voice their opinions and are listened to by college directors. Bang for the buck Money spent at Barton is well spent. The Professors are all willing to help if extra assistance is needed. There are no teachers aids here, direct professor to student involvement. Am enjoying being here Barton College is a fun little place in walking distance to downtown Wilson, NC. Wilson is a growing community with new stores and places to eat popping up frequently. As for on campus, there is always something interesting happening, ranging from free movies to pudding slides to worship services.
