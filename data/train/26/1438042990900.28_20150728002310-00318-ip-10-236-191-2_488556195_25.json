Most articles of clothing will boost your respect and sex appeal stats. Clothing makes up 4% of your respect level and 50% of your sex appeal level. Make sure you consider each article of clothing before making a decision on what to wear. Note that each save house has a changing room, where you can change different articles of clothing (only the ones you have purchased though). The best way to find a clothing store is to look at your in-game map. Each location is marked on the map, just head to where the icon is and you should find that store. Here are the general locations for each of the stores: (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});",
