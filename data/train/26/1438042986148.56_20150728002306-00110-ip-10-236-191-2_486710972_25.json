Methods for quenching undesired side reactions of pathogen inactivating compounds that include a functional group which is, or which is capable of forming, an electrophilic group, are described in the co-filed U.S. patent application, \u201cMethods for Quenching Pathogen Inactivators in Biological Systems\u201d, U.S. Ser. No. 60/070,597, filed Jan. 6, 1998, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein. In this method, a material, such a's a blood product, is treated with the pathogen inactivating compound and a quencher, wherein the quencher comprises a nucleophilic functional group that is capable of covalently reacting with the electrophilic group. In one embodiment, the pathogen inactivating compound includes a nucleic acid binding ligand and a functional group, such as a mustard group, which is capable of reacting in situ to form the electrophilic group. Examples of quenchers include, but are not limited to, compounds including nucleophilic groups. Exemplary nucleophilic groups include thiol, thioacid, dithoic acid, thiocarbamate, dithiocarbamate, amine, phosphate, and thiophosphate groups. The quencher may be, or contain, a nitrogen heterocycle such as pyridine. The quencher can be a phosphate containing compound such as glucose-6-phosphate. The quencher also can be a thiol containing compound, including, but not limited to, glutathione, cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, mercaptoethanol, dimercaprol, mercaptan, mercaptoethanesulfonic acid and salts thereof, e.g., MESNA, homocysteine, aminoethane thiol, dimethylaminoethane thiol, dithiothreitol, and other thiol containing compounds. Exemplary aromatic thiol compounds include 2-mercaptobenzimidazolesulfonic acid, 2-mercapto-nicotinic acid, napthalenethiol, quinoline thiol, 4-nitro-thiophenol, and thiophenol. Other quenchers include nitrobenzylpyridine and inorganic nucleophiles such as selenide salts or organoselenides, thiosulfate, sulfite, sulfide, thiophosphate, pyrophosphate, hydrosulfide, and dithionitrite. The quencher can be a peptide compound containing a nucleophilic group. For example, the quencher may be a cysteine containing compound, for example, a dipeptide, such as GlyCys, or a tripeptide, such as glutathione., 157227=In the experimental disclosure which follows, the following abbreviations apply: eq (equivalents); M (Molar); \u03bcM (micromolar); N (Normal); mol (moles); mmol (millimoles); \u03bcmol (micromoles); nmol (nanomoles); g (grams); mg (milligrams); \u03bcg (micrograms); Kg (kilograms); L (liters); mL (milliliters); \u03bcL (microliters); cm (centimeters); mm (millimeters); \u03bcm (micrometers); nm (nanometers); min.

Plasma (6.0 mL) was added to vials containing adsorbent treated with different stabilizing agents. Masses of adsorbent were corrected for glycerol or PEG content to give 0.2 g of adsorbent. The vials were placed on a rotator and agitated at room temperature. Plasma samples were removed at various times and levels of residual 3H-4\u2032-(4-amino-2-oxa)butyl-4,5\u2032,8-trimethyl psoralen were determined. Samples (200 \u03bcL) were diluted in 5.0 mL of Optiphase HiSafe Liquid Scintillation Cocktail (Wallac) and were counted on a Wallac 1409 Liquid Scintillation Counter (Wallac)., 88914=In one preferred embodiment the particles are Norit A Supra, which is available from Norit Americas, Inc. (Atlanta, Ga.). Norit A Supra is a USP-grade activated carbon that is formed by steam activation of coconut shell. This activated carbon has a very high total surface area (2000 m2/g) and is very microporous in nature., 165278=A device containing non-immobilized dry (uncoated) Dowex\ufffd XUS-43493 (2.5 g) and pHEMA-coated Dowex\ufffd XUS-43493 (3.0 g or 5.0 g) were prepared by placing the desired mass of adsorbent into a square 30 \u03bcm polyester mesh pouch (7 cm\ufffd7 cm). The adsorbent-filled pouches were inserted into separate sterile, 1-liter PL 2410 Plastic containers (Baxter) and heat sealed with an impulse sealer. Thereafter, the adsorbent-filled pouches containing PL-2410 Plastic containers were sterilized by either E-beam (NIS) or gamma irradiation (SteriGenics) to 2.5 MRad; as previously alluded to, E-beam sterilization is generally preferred., 124835=Preferably, the resulting adsorption medium comprises known amounts of adsorbent per area. The adsorbent per area is from about 300 g/m2 to about 1100 g/m2, preferably from about 500 g/m2 to about 700 g/m2. Thus, the appropriate amount of adsorbent contemplated for a specific purpose can be measured simply by cutting a predetermined area of the fiberized resin (i.e., there is no weighing of the fiberized resin)., 123933=In a preferred embodiment, the adsorbent particles are immobilized in a fiber matrix that is formed by thermal bonding of a biocomponent fiber network. An alternative embodiment involves immobilizing adsorbent particles in non-biocomponent fibers and using a wet strength resin system, adhesives or additional fusible fibers to form bonds between the fibers and adsorbent particles. Nonlimiting examples of useful fibers include polyester, nylon and polyolefin. (Suppliers of fibers for the nonwovens industry have been listed in \u201cA Guide to Fibers for Nonwovens,\u201d Nonwovens Industry, June 1998, 66\u201387.) Examples of wet strength resin systems include melamine/formaldehyde, epichlorohydrin-based resins, polyamines and polyamides. The use of heat fusible fibers for immobilizing particles in fiber matrices has been disclosed. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,160,059., 41980=An extensive body of research exists regarding the removal of substances from blood products. The bulk of this research is directed at white cell reduction. See, e.g., M. N. Boomgaard et al., Transfusion 34:311 (1994); F. Bertolini et al., Vox Sang 62:82 (1992); and A. M. Joustra-Dijkhuis et al., Vox Sang 67:22 (1994). Filtration of platelets is the most common method used in white cell reduction of platelet concentrates. See, e.g., M. B\ufffdck et al., Transfusion 31:333 (1991) (Sepacell PL-5A, Asahi, Tokyo, Japan); J. D. Sweeney et al., Transfusion 35:131 (1995) (Leukotrap PL, Miles Inc., Covina, Calif.); and M. van Marwijk et al., Transfusion 30:34 (1990) (Cellselect, NPBI, Emmer-Compascuum, The Netherlands; Immugard Ig-500, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). These current filtration mechanisms, however are not amenable for the removal of relatively low molecular weight compounds including for example psoralens, psoralen photoproducts and other compounds commonly used in treating biological fluids., 91036=Hypercrosslinked polystyrene networks, such as Dowex\ufffd XUS-43493 and Purolite MN-200 are preferably in the form of spherical particles with a diameter range of about 10 \u03bcm to about 200 \u03bcm. Adsorbent particles, including for example, Dowex\ufffd XUS-43493, preferably have extremely high internal surface areas and relatively small pores (e.g. 46 \u212b). The internal surface area of the particle can be from about 300 to about 1100 m2/g; preferably 1100 m2/g. The pores size of the particle can be greater than 25 \u212b and less than 800 \u212b; preferably from about 25 \u212b to about 150 \u212b; most preferably from about 25 \u212b to about 50 \u212b. While it is not intended that the present invention be limited to the mechanism by which reduction of small organic compounds takes place, hydrophobic interaction is believed to be the primary mechanism of adsorption. Its porous nature confers selectively on the adsorption process by allowing small molecules to access a greater proportion of the surface area relative to large molecules (i.e., proteins) and cells. Purolite\ufffd has many similar characteristics to Dowex\ufffd XUS-43493, such as high affinity for psoralens and superior wetting properties, and is also a preferred adsorbent particle., 165933=Hoechst Celanese prepared fiberized resin containing Amberlite\ufffd XAD-16 according to the method described in Example 1. The fiberized resin was cut into squares (14 cm\ufffd14 cm); the resulting sections contained approximately 2.5 g of dry Amberlite\ufffd XAD-16. The Amberlite\ufffd XAD-16 of the fiberized resin was simultaneously wet and coated with pHEMA by soaking in a solution containing 50 mg/mL pHEMA in 95% ethanol/5% distilled water. Residual ethanol was removed by rinsing twice in saline for 10 minutes. This procedure resulted in a coating of approximately 6% (w/w) pHEMA. The fiberized resin was then sterilized by autoclaving on \u201cwet\u201d cycle for 45 minutes at 121\ufffd C. Thereafter, the fiberized resin was inserted into separate sterile, 1-liter PL 2410 Plastic containers (Baxter) and heat sealed in a laminar flow hood, using sterile scissors, hemostats, and an impulse sealer., 82360=The phrase \u201csubstantially maintaining a desired biological activity of the biological composition\u201d refers to substantially maintaining properties of a biological composition which are believed to be indicative of the potential performance of the composition in a therapeutic setting. For example, in the case of plasma, in vivo activity is not destroyed or significantly lowered if the level of clotting factors, such as Factors I, II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, or the change in PT and PTT time are substantially maintained in plasma when treated by the methods described herein. For example, the change in level of clotting factors, such as Factors I, II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI of the treated plasma can be less than about 20%; preferably less than about 10%. The change in PT and PTT time for the treated plasma can be, for example, less than about 3 seconds and greater than 1 second; preferably 1.5 seconds. It is further contemplated that the phrase substantially maintained for each of the properties associated with a described biological composition may also include values acceptable to those of ordinary skill in the art as described in the literature, including for example in Klein H. G., ed. Standards for Blood Banks and Transfusion Services, 17th Ed., Bethesda, Md.: American Association of Blood Banks, 1996, incorporated by reference herein., 43054=The process of adsorption has been used to isolate selective blood components onto phospholipid polymers. For example, several copolymers with various electrical charges have been evaluated for their interactions with blood components, including platelet adhesion and protein adsorption. K. Ishihara et al., J. Biomed. Mat. Res. 28:1347 (1994). Such polymers, however, are not designed for the adsorption of low molecular weight compounds., 265743=Two units of ABO-matched whole blood were obtained from the Sacramento Blood Center (Sacramento, Calif.). The units were maintained at room temperature following donation. The two units were transferred to two PL2410 plastic storage containers (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Ill.) containing 4 pieces of Millipore RA type membrane (47 mm, Millipore, Marlborough, Mass.). The whole blood was incubated for 24 hours at room temperature with the cellulose acetate membranes (Millipore RA) to induce complement activation. Psoralen (150 \u03bcM S-59 (4\u2032-(4-amino-2-oxa)butyl-4,5\u2032,8-trimethyl psoralen)) was added to each whole blood unit immediately before hemoperfusion was initiated., 48139=In another embodiment, the activated carbon particulate adsorbent has a surface area greater than about 1200 m2/g., 87995=Preferred activated carbons are those that are specially cleaned and/or meet United States Pharmacopoeia Standards. Moreover, activated carbons with surface areas greater than 950 m2/g are preferred and those with surface areas greater than 1200 m2/g are more preferred, as activated carbons with more surface area available to the low molecular weight compound generally show better adsorption. Activated carbons formed by steam activation tend to have more hydrophobic surfaces, so for more hydrophobic low molecular weight compounds, these steam activated carbons often have better binding capacity and these carbons are preferred. Less macroporosity confers selectivity for low molecular weight compounds over large proteins that mediate biological activity, so activated carbons with less macroporosity, for example activated carbons prepared from coconut shell are also preferred., 240911=To complete disposable manufacture, a 1 LPL2410 bag was docked to \u215b\u2033 OD tubing and the tubing was then attached to the outlet of the IAD such that the distance from the midline of the IAD to the bag was 40 cm. The same sized tubing was attached to the inlet of the SRD such that when the illumination bag is docked to it, the distance from the midline to the bag would be 30 cm., 135378=Particularly preferred particles are Norit A Supra, which is available from Norit Americas, Inc. (Atlanta, Ga.). Norit A Supra is a USP-grade activated carbon that is formed by steam activation of coconut shells. This activated carbon has a very high total surface area (2000 m2/g) and is very microporous in nature., 41075=This application is a continuation application of application Ser. No. 09/112,068, filed Jul. 8, 1998, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part application of application Ser. No. 09/003,113, filed Jan. 6, 1998, now abandoned, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/779,885 and of Ser.

No. 09/112,068 and 09/003,113 are each incorporated by reference in their entirety., 163530=The fiberized resin and adsorbent-containing pouches were sterilized by autoclaving on \u201cwet\u201d cycle for 45 minutes at 121\ufffd C. Thereafter, the fiberized resin and the adsorbent-containing pouches were inserted into separate, sterile, 1-liter PL 2410 Plastic containers (Baxter). Following insertion, the PL 2410 Plastic containers were heat sealed in a laminar flow hood, using sterile scissors, hemostats, and an impulse sealer.}",
