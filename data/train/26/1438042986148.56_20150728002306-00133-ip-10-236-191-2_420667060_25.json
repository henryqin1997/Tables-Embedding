Synonyms are alternative words or phrases closely related in meaning to the term name, with indication of the relationship between the name and synonym given by the synonym scope. Click on the Synonyms GO:0039528 Wiki Page GONUTS This term should be used for annotation when it is not known which cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor (PRR) has detected the viral RNA. If the PRR is known, consider instead the child terms. The RIG-like family is composed of at least RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I; also known as DDX58), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5; also known as helicard or IFIH1) and LGP2.
