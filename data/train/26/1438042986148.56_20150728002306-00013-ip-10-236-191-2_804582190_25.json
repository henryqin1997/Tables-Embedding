The Sport Fishing Index score ranges from a high of 60 (excellent) to a low of 20 (very poor). The Sport Fishing Index scores for different species are based both on population measures (the size and health of the individual fish, along with the number of fish present) and information on angler use and success (the number of anglers looking for a particular type of fish, and the number of that type that they actually catch). To help anglers decide where they have the best chance of catching their favorite types of fish, TVA and state fisheries agencies have created a Sport Fishing Index that reflects fishing quality for different species in the TVA reservoirs.
