(In the 2003 SSBF data, there are five implicates.) Once the separate implicate estimates are derived, the second part involves estimating the between-imputation variance of each parameter and then combining the between-imputation variance with sampling variance to obtain an overall (sample and imputation) variance.12, 32225=The sum of the weights for the 4,240 firms completing survey is about 6.3 million, indicating that the current sample is representative of approximately 6.3 million firms that met the target population definition and were listed on the Dun's Market Identifier File in May 2004. For the sample as a whole, the weights averaged 1485. For firms with less than 20 employees, the weights averaged 2034. For firms with 20-49 employees, the weights averaged 666. The weights averaged 240 for firms with 50-99 employees and 155 for firms with 100-499 employees., 157053=This section discusses two particular features of the 2003 SSBF as they relate to estimation using the 2003 SSBF data: (l) the sample observations are NOT drawn from a simple random sample; and (2) missing values on the data set have been multiply imputed. Both of these features affect the calculation of estimates (means, regression coefficients) and their standard errors and variances. Below, some examples using SAS are provided. The discussion is intended to illustrate how the multiply-imputed 2003 SSBF data can be used. The discussion is not exhaustive, nor is it meant to provide an endorsement for SAS. There are many estimation softwares that offer the ability to incorporate design parameters and multiply imputed data when analyzing survey results., 16133=[11] R.J.A. Little, and Rubin, D.B., Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, 2nd ed., New York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2002, D.B. Rubin, \"Multiple Imputation After 18+ Years,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association, 91, 473-489, 1996., 16850=This survey was funded by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. As with any project of this scope, many people contributed to the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances (SSBF). John Wolken served as the Board's SSBF project director and principal investigator. Traci Mach served as an economist, and Courtney Carter and Lieu Hazelwood served as Financial Analysts on the SSBF staff. Able research assistance was provided by Katie Wilson and John Holmes., 15117=[4] \"The 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances: Pretest I Report,\" mimeo, National Opinion Research Center, 2004., 95284=Information on the owners of the firm was collected differently for the 2003 survey than it had been previously. In the past, characteristics of owners were collected only for the owner with the largest share, and respondents were asked whether a majority of firm owners were Hispanic, minority, or female. The 2003 survey followed the lead taken by the U.S. Census Bureau in its 2002 Survey of Business Owners, and collected individual demographic information on up to three owners.5 Respondents were asked to report on the individual with the largest ownership share first; if that individual did not have a controlling interest in the company (an ownership share of at least 51 percent), information was also collected on all remaining owners up to a maximum of two additional individuals. The change provides additional detail on specific owners and the organizational structure of the firm. At the same time, however, questions about the firm as a whole were not asked for these topics and must be constructed from the characteristics of the individual owners., 67935=Section M of the questionnaire consists of a series of questions regarding recent capital injections. This section was included primarily to determine the prevalence of capital injections among smaller businesses. Questions M1, M2, and M3 were asked of proprietorships and partnerships. Questions M4 through M8 were asked of corporations. Few firms reported attempting to raise equity in 2003. Consequently, the subsequent questions were answered by only a few firms. There were few missing values in this section. All missing values in this section have been imputed. However, because most firms did not attempt to raise outside capital, some of the imputations are calculated on very few observations., 177147=SUM OF WEIGHTS 6262334.4, 97378=weighted average of the individual characteristics.6 (Note that in the 2003 survey, owners were allowed to select more than one race, thereby allowing firms to be classified as more than one race as well.) For firms where less than 100 percent of the ownership was reported, characteristics were scaled up to equal 100., 15648=[8] Traci Mach and John Wolken, \"Financial Services Used by Small Businesses: Evidence from the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances,\" Federal Reserve Bulletin, October, 2006., 6042=GENERAL AND NEW FEATURES OF THE 2003 SSBF DATA SET 1, 200853=This chapter has illustrated how to use information on the sample design of the 2003 SSBF (weights and strata) together with the multiply imputed survey data to estimate population means and regression parameters. Today, many statistical estimation packages have procedures that account for sample design and account for multiply-imputed survey., 3269=Before using the data base, users should at a minimum read the following sections of the codebook: Section I: Analysis Weights; Section III: Using the 2003 Public Data Base; Section IV: Combining Data on the Use of Financial Services; and Section V: Multiple Imputation Analysis., 42138=All geographic information reported was verified against USPS city-state-zip code data as of April 2004 (near June when data collection began). Urban/rural status, metropolitan code, and county were derived from the firm's address., 14711=[2a] \"2003 of Small Business Finances Survey Screener Questionnaire,\" Appendix D in \"The 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances Methodology Report,\" mimeo, National Opinion Research Center, April 2005., 222850=A0_HHI0 Banking Market Concentration 2003 - 100% Bank Deposits, 16004=[10] SAS/STAT 9.1 Users Guide, The SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, 2004, pp. 4183-4470., 41104=Additionally, approximately 1320 firms sent in hard-copy records (tax forms, filled-out worksheets, accounting statements, etc.) to assist in verification. (See below for additional detail on the balance sheet edits and imputation.), 220969=CF_FAMILY Firm owned by single family in 2003, 14568=[2] \"The 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances Methodology Report,\" mimeo, National Opinion Research Center, April 2005., 41348=Any firm replying that the Dun & Bradstreet reported SIC code was not the firm's principal activity was asked to give an open-ended response describing what it did. NORC encoded 1572 verbatim responses into the appropriate SIC codes. Of these, 667 were encoded to their original values. NORC's codings were reviewed and corrected by project staff (A0_SIC2_FIN)., 70282=In the 2003 survey (as in the 1998 survey), to avoid inconsistencies in total versus sum of detail, respondents were asked a total (e.g., assets, liabilities, equity, or profit) only if they failed to report the detail completely. Complete reporting of the detail means that a dollar amount was given for each of the detail elements involved in a sum. For example, in the case of R12, total assets, respondents were asked to report R12 only if one or more of the variables R1-R7 and R9 were answered as don't know, refusal, or as a range. In the instances where all the asset elements had valid values, totals were calculated from the detail., 15856=[9] Stata Survey Data Reference Manual Release 9, Stata Corporation, Stata Press, College Station, Texas, 2005., 15253=[5] \"The 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances: Pretest II Report,\" mimeo,National Opinion Research Center, 2004., 222925=A0_HHI100 Banking Market Concentration 2003 - 100% Bank Deposits, 100% Thrift Deposits, 160013=As is true in virtually any survey, there is some amount of missingness in the survey variables. As described earlier, virtually all missing values in the 2003 SSBF data set have been imputed. Generally, the imputations involved fitting a model to predict the missing value, and then adding a random term to the predicted value. The 2003 release contains five copies or implicates of the data set, each containing survey information on the same 4,240 firms. Reported data values do not differ across implicates; in contrast, however, imputed values may differ across implicates. By providing users with separate implicates, estimates from each implicate can be combined so that valid statistical inferences that properly reflect the uncertainty due to missing values can be obtained.11, 54810=New in this survey are specific questions about the use of credit and debit card processing services (Section G). In previous surveys, information on credit card processing was collected in conjunction with information on transactions services. In 2003, credit card processing services were taken out of transactions services, but included in question G9 which asks about the use of credit card-, signature debit card- and pin debit card-processing. For more information on comparability of results across surveys, see ([8])., 28258=The reference period for most questions is the date of the interview. The majority of interviews were completed between June and December, 2004. The reference period for the income statement and balance sheet is the firm's fiscal-year end. Firms whose fiscal year ended between January 1 and June 30 reported for the fiscal year ending 2004. Firms whose fiscal year ended between July 1 and December 31 reported for the fiscal year ending 2003., 73383=One note of caution regarding the balance sheet values. The information on total loans (S1) is often different than the amount of loans outstanding obtained by adding up the values from section F of the question. One possible reason for this possible inconsistency has to do with reference periods. The balance sheet information was collected as of the last date of the firm's fiscal year. Firms whose fiscal year ended between January 1 and June 30 reported for the fiscal year ending 2004. Firms whose fiscal year ended between July 1 and December 31 reported for the fiscal year ending 2003. Other interview data were as of the date of the interview. Most interviews took place between July and December 2004. Consequently, for a firm whose fiscal year ended July 31, 2003 but was not interviewed until December, 2004, as much as 18 months separate reference dates for the balance sheet data and for other survey data (e.g., loans outstanding in section F of the questionnaire)., 48039=A NOTE ON THE IMPLICATES: In past SSBF data releases, while a single fully imputed data set was released, the data were imputed in the same way as the 2003 survey. In the 2003 SSBF, the data release contains five implicates (see Section V below). Each implicate (identified in the data as A0_IMPLICAT) is fully imputed and contains 4,240 observations. Across implicates, all reported values (for a given firm) are identical, whereas imputed values may differ. In fact, it is this difference in imputation values that allows users to combine estimates from the separate implicates to calculate standard errors that are appropriately adjusted to include the variation from the random portion of the imputed value (see [6])., 15389=[6] Donald B. Rubin, \"Multiple Imputation After 18+ Years,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association, vol 91 (June 1996), pp. 473-489., 2228=NOTE WELL: For the 2003 release, the SSBF data set includes 5 implicates. Each implicate includes 4,240 firms. In total, the entire data set contains 21,200 observations. NOTE: Even though there are five implicates, there are still only 4,240 firm observations. Across implicates, the values of all reported variables remain constant, but the values of imputed variables may differ. The implicates are provided to allow users to adjust the estimated standard errors and confidence intervals to account for the additional variance that imputation may cause (see [6] in Survey References on page 6). Also, see Section V below for some examples., 14424=[l] \"2003 Survey of Small Business Finances Survey Annotated Questionnaire,\" mimeo, Federal Reserve Board, September 2006., 156653=Users of the 2003 SSBF should keep in mind that the data have been produced through complex survey methods. These methods need to be accounted for when making inferences based on the data. Ignoring the survey aspects of the data will generally lead to incorrect point and parameter estimates and generally underestimated estimated variance and standard errors, sometimes substantially so., 1684=The data set for the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances contains information on 4,240 small businesses that were in operation during December 2003 and at the time of the interview. The interview for most firms took place between June and December in 2004. The reference date for most questions is the date of the interview; the reference date for the income statement and balance sheet information is the date of the firm's most recent fiscal year-end and can range from July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2004 (see B2_1DAY & B2_1MO)., 2899=As was true in the 1993 and 1998 databases, each questionnaire variable includes a companion or shadow variable (an \"xcode\") that indicates whether and how the variable might have been imputed. In all cases, the shadow variable or xcode is named \"x\" followed with the original variable name. Please see section III for further discussion., 14944=[3] Arthur B. Kennickell, \"Multiple Imputation in the Survey of Consumer Finance,\" prepared for the August 1998 Joint Statistical Meetings, Dallas, TX., 12751=The public version of the 2003 SSBF excludes information that could potentially identify any particular business, its owners, or the financial sources used by the business. In particular, names of firms and financial sources, specific geographic location and exact responses to open-ended questions are excluded from the public data set. Thus, the contents of the public-use version of the data base and the questionnaire (see [1]) differ., 158797=The sample design of the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances was a systematic stratified random design with oversampling of the larger employment size classes (firms with 20 or more employees). Sample weights have been produced to account for disproportionate sampling and unit nonresponse. The data set also includes the original stratification variables. These design features potentially affect the calculation of both population estimates and their variances. 9 As succinctly put in the STATA manual, \"it is important to use sampling weights in order to get the point estimates right. We must consider the weighting, clustering, and stratification of the survey design to get the standard errors right.\"10, 223024=A0_HHI50 Banking Market Concentration 2003 - 100% Bank Deposits, 50% Thrift Deposits, 50780=Section C contains information on characteristics of owners and certain firm characteristics. Information on the owners of the firm was collected differently for the 2003 survey than it had been previously. In the past, characteristics of owners were collected only for the owner with the largest share, and respondents were asked whether a majority of firm owners were Hispanic, minority, or female. The 2003 survey followed the lead taken by the U.S. Census Bureau in its 2002 Survey of Business Owners, and collected individual demographic information on up to three owners.3 Respondents were asked to report on the individual with the largest ownership share first; if that individual did not have a controlling interest in the company (an ownership share of at least 51 percent), information was also collected on all remaining owners up to a maximum of two additional individuals., 12190=This codebook is the principal guide to the variables included on the public version of the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances (SSBF). Because of the complexity of skip-patterns in the survey questionnaire, and because question wording sometimes varied by firm characteristics, it is advisable that users reference the questionnaire while using this codebook and data. To facilitate this, all variables derived from the questionnaire and described in this codebook have references tying them to specific questions contained in the questionnaire., 20039=The 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances provides information about a nationally representative sample of small businesses in the United States. The survey was conducted during 2004-2005 for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The target population is the population of all for-profit, nonfinancial, nonfarm, nonsubsidiary business enterprises that had fewer than 500 employees and were in operation as of year-end 2003 and on the date of the interview. For the 2003 survey, employment was defined as the number of employees and owners working in the firm (whether or not the employees were full or part time or paid or unpaid). This is the same calculation used in the 1998 Survey. The sample was drawn from the Dun's Market Identifier file as of May 2004.1 The public use data set contains five \"implicates\" of 4,240 firms, for a total of 21,200 firm-implicate observations. Five separate implicates are included to help quantify the effects that imputed values have on estimates of standard errors (see Section V below). These firms represent 6.3 million small businesses. The public data base contains weights and stratification variables (see variables FIN_WGT and A0_STRATUM) which can help to estimate population statistics for the types of businesses included in the survey, as well as implicate number and a firm identifier., 157827=Please note that the 2003 SSBF data set contains 4,240 cases. The database consists of five implicates, each of which contains 4,240 cases and can be identified by the variable A0_IMPLICAT. Although there are 5 * 4,240 observations in total, there are still only 4,240 separate firms. Values of variables that were reported in the interview have the same value on each implicate. Values of variables that were missing in the interview and have been imputed may have different values on each implicate. The examples below illustrate how to account for survey design characteristics in estimation and how to combine estimates from each implicate to account for the additional uncertainty due to imputation., 15561=[7] 2002 SURVEY OF BUSINESS OWNERS (SBO) at http://www.census.gov/csd/sbo/.}",
