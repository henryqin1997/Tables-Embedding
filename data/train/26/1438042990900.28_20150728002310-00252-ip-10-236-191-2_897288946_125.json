I really enjoy attending this college because they have everything that I was looking for, and the professors are great and very helpful. I fell hard on times with some family issues, and the counselors offered me help in my situation and were very caring, I took a quarter off so that I can get my life in order so that I can focus on school when I go back. I plan to go back in the winter to finish out my degree., 526926=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 55453=campus safety disappointed me a bit. in the winter 2011 my car had an engine problem. i couldn't get home and was stuck in the parking lot. i didn't know what was wrong with my car at that time, because it would start but not drive faster than 10mph. i called campus safety but was rejected. i had to call a friend of mine to pick me up. later i found out that i was out of transmission fluid, and my car wouldn't shift., 73861=1) if you do not know how to use a computer very well, take a basic computer course before taking an english or history class. 2) do all of the blueprint workshops before enrolling in classes 3) see if you qualify for trio 4) if you get a non-student job on campus, you'll have access to parking spaces, and possibly have benefits. 5) buy books on craigslist 6) if you arrive at 7:30 parking is a piece of cake; 7:45 and you will be late to class. 7) Best secluded study areas are on the 3rd floor of the library, the basement of Nestor, and the group study rooms in the library. 8)}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students If you go to this school be sure to keep up with your all your material's ,class information and be ready to be active in the process of your successes. Bang for the buck alot of the time students are not given the right advice from the adviser's so you take the wrong classes. Am enjoying being here I have not had a positive experience here . the school is very unorganized and it is hard to get the information you need in a timely manner.
