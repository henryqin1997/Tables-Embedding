Holmes' 19- yard catch on the third play of the march keyed the drive., 73713=But the Jets would not have possession again until there was 1:02 left in the game as the Patriots ran more than six minutes off the clock with a 69-yard drive resulting in a 28-yard Stephen Gostkowski field goal., 72685=Tom Brady completed 24-of-33 passes for 321 yards and a touchdown with an interception for the Patriots (4-1). Wes Welker caught five passes for 124 yards, helping New England post at least 30 points for the 13th straight regular season game, one off the NFL record 14 by St. Louis (1999-2000)., 75144=The Patriots took over with 3:17 left in the half and drove all the way down to the Jets 11, but Brady's pass in the closing seconds bounced off the hands of Aaron Hernandez in the end zone and right to Antonio Cromartie. It was Brady's first career red zone interception at home in his career., 74720=The Patriots would only manage one first down, however, and Gostkowski nailed a 44-yard field goal with 11:15 left in the half.}",
