All rights reserved., 7551=A right-arm fast bowler, who can swing the ball at will, James first honed his skills with brother Darren at their home backyard before going on to play for Dandenong Cricket Club and the Australia Under-19 teams. He had a wonderful 2009-10 season, where in a domestic one-day match he ripped through New South Wales\u2019 batting line-up with a fiery spell. James made his Australia A debut in 2010 before impressing national selectors at the \u2018Australian Centre of Excellence\u2019 and soon received the big call-up. He was named to replace an injured Josh Hazlewood on Australia\u2019s tour to India in 2010. Unfortunately his first opportunity on the international stage turned out to be a damp squib as he was ruled out due to a stiff back., 21786=Mar 02 2013,, 8289=Later, under Michael Clarke\u2019s captaincy, James made his ODI debut in 2011 against Bangladesh. However, he had an impressive Test debut against New Zealand later that year, picking up six wickets in the match that included a five-wicket haul and was also adjudged Man of the Match., 20000=Mar 22 2013,, 22692=Feb 22 2013,}",

After playing just four first-class matches, such was the selectors\u2019 faith that they included him for Australia\u2019s Test tour of India.
