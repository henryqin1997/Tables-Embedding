While it is filling, and there are a variety of options to choose from including a fruit and salad bar and a grill, you could likely find places that are better off campus.

Bang for the buck I think this school is very affordable. There are many scholarship opportunities for all students. Also tuition is approximately $9,150 per semester and you can take anywhere from 12-19 credits. That breaks down to $481-$763 per credit.
