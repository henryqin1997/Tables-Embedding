They landed on January 3rd and 4th, 2004. Their primary scientific goal was to study the geology of Mars and search for signs of water. Although they were expected to last only 3 months, they have been vigorously sending back data for over 2 years and are still going strong! In this activity, students receive simulated Martian soils and are given the task of designing 3 tests to determine whether the soil sample contains something alive or something that was once alive. They may use any of the tools from the previous lessons \u2013 agar plates, tests for organic molecules, microscopes, or something of their own design. This assignment allows students an opportunity to demonstrate what they have learned throughout the unit, both about scientific experimentation and about the special characteristics of living things., 124395=In 1771 and 1772, Priestly conducted a series of experiments using a bell jar. It was known that a candle placed in a sealed bell jar would eventually burn out and could not be relighted while still in the jar. Priestly discovered that a plant can survive indefinitely within a jar. Thus, he tried placing a plant into the jar with the burning candle. The candle went out as before and could not be relit right away. Priestly waited several days and tried again. The candle could be relit! The plant had restored the air inside the jar! (Do not try the next series of experiments since it harms animals!) Next priestly investigated what would happen to animals. He found that a mouse placed inside a sealed jar will eventually collapse. However, a mouse can survive in a sealed jar with a plant since the plant restores the air. Priestly was the first to demonstrate that oxygen is necessary for fire and animals but that given time, plants can create oxygen, allowing fires to burn and animals to breathe., 124039=Summary These experiments use a bell jar (or any other very large, clear, glass jar) to determine the identity of the gas produced by plants. It mirrors the famous experiments of Joseph Priestley and Jan Ingenhousz from the 1700\u2019s that first demonstrated the existence of oxygen and its importance to plants and animals., 166759=To schedule a program, contact Gail Broderick at: 650-364-2760 ext. 10 or gail@sfbaymsi.org, 125423=A few years later, Jan Ingenhousz investigated the effect of light on a plant\u2019s ability to restore air. He found that a plant left in darkness cannot restore the air for a candle. To demonstrate this, he burned up all the oxygen in a jar with a plant then left the plant in sunlight for a few days to restore the air. Then without relighting the candle, he put the plant into darkness for several more days. At the end of the dark period, he was unable to relight the candle. He concluded that a plant in darkness acts like animals, using up the oxygen that it had created. Ingenhousz had discovered that plants can photosynthesize and create oxygen but only in the light. If left in the dark, plants do not photosynthesize and thus no oxygen is produced. Moreover plants are always performing respiration, just like animals. In sunlight, the rate of photosynthesis outstrips respiration so there is an excess of oxygen being produced. But in darkness, no photosynthesis takes place but respiration continues to occur. Thus, by keeping a plant in darkness you can demonstrate that plants need oxygen and use it up, just like animals.}",

Can begin to categorize objects as alive or not alive. Can recognize that movement does not necessarily mean something is alive. Summary What does it mean to be alive? Is a cactus alive? Is a seed alive? Is the air we breathe alive? What are the necessary characteristics? To hook students into the question, they are introduced to \u201cglue monsters\u201d (sometimes known as \u201cscooting glue\u201d) and the class discusses whether the \u201cmonsters\u201d are alive or not. Next, students are given cards with the names of various objects and asked to sort them into categories: alive, once was alive, never alive, and not sure. Finally, students create a list defining the characteristics of life \u2013 a set of characteristics that all living things share. The list is initially developed in pairs, then in larger groups of 4, and ultimately as a whole class. The final list is turned into a poster that can be referenced and modified throughout the remainder of the unit as students learn more about what it takes to be alive. What does it mean to be alive? Is a cactus alive? Is a seed alive? Is the air we breathe alive? What are the necessary characteristics? To hook students into ... 1. Is it alive? Physiology is",
    "textAfterTable": "Grouping The card sorting activity and initial creation of a list of the characteristics of life is done in pairs. These pairs will eventually merge in groups of 4 to compare, discuss, and revise their lists. The remainder of the discussion takes place as an entire class. Materials For the \u201cglue monsters\u201d demo, the teacher needs: 1 overhead projector 1 tube of Duco\u00ae cement glue (according to Flinn Scientific, this is the only brand of glue that works reliably) 1 clear Petri dish water ground pepper or pencil shavings For the card sorting activity, each pair of students needs: copy of the sorting cards on cardstock paper, cut out and placed in an envelope For developing a characteristics of life list, each class needs: butcher paper or flip chart paper markers Setting Classroom 1. Is it alive? - Background Teacher Background Many middle school students believe that the defining characteristic of living things is that they move. When they see the \u201cglue monsters\u201d wiggle in the Petri dish, most will immediately assume they are alive. What is going on? Duco\u00ae cement is polymer mixed in a water soluble solvent. When the cement is exposed to air as it drops into the dish, a thin, solid polymer skin quickly forms around the liquid, solvent-polymer mixture. When the bead of cement is immersed in water, the solvent diffuses through the skin, causing the bead",
