            "big campus, but they do a great job of offering buses and free rides/walks so that you feel safe walking home at any time of the night!",
            "self-motivated. sports fanatics. love the big atmosphere.",
            "i am actually transferring for my major, which madison does not offer. obviously i would like to stay, but there were a few things i did dislike about the system: i am not someone who learns in a large environment, i need personal relationships with my professors and classrooms, because i feel lost otherwise. thought i wanted to get away from the feel of a small town, but i end up going right back to it. it is beyond frustrating to be accepted into madison, and then be in constant competition to simply declare a major. for many of the majors you need to apply to get into that specific school. if i'm paying for the education, i should be able to study what i want. i love saying that i go to madison, but the experience i'm getting is not worth the reputation, i need to go somewhere that can get me into classes i want to take and get me on the right track for my future, since college is about preparing yourself for later, not just about partying. extremely liberal, but to each their own! living is extremely overpriced. i could nit-pick at many things, but about every college there will be things you dislike.",
            "pops and eds are fine, not too bad, but you will get sick of it as expected. downtown madison has so much to offer and it is amazing how much there is to do, as long as you're willing to pay.",
            "as nice and ogg and smith are, go with witte or sellery. sure, you'll suffer during the first few months, but the people you'll meet are much more open and fun than the busy athletes or already established sophomores in the newer dorms.",
            "classes are hard, especially when you're in a lecture of 200 most of the time. it is nice to disappear in class once in a while, but unless you are self-motivated and are willing to teach yourself most things, i would go for a smaller school. or hire a tutor.",
            "people will tell you to get involved in college, bottom line is that it is not as easy as it sounds. madison has much to offer, but it is difficult for those of us who are more reserved. most i can say is be willing to step outside of your comfort zone.",
            "madison is not a slacker school. you tend to be just a number, but if you can find your way with a social crowd the transition is much easier. the athletics and party scene are to be admired, but unless you are comfortable with just being a number in class, this isn't the school for you."

While not everyone can score tickets (which go on sale every June and sell out within an hour), everywhere you go, you will pass by viewing parties. Other traditions focus on Bascom Hill, the stretch of land that was the original campus. From the 'Battle for Bascom' snowball fights (between Southeast and Lakeshore campus'), Tray sledding, studying under the shade of a tree on the first warm day, or rubbing Abe's foot for good luck, it's the place of tradition., 225606=Madison's cost are reasonable, although I heard that they will be raising tuition by $2000 every year. I didn't really get any financial aid except for an actuarial science scholarship, so I wish I could have gotten a little more help. But through internships and jobs I think the cost is manageable., 1037239=Apply during the first application window! I applied before in September, before the first deadline in October, and knew by early November that I had been accepted. Also, apply for the scholarships through your college in early February., 316538=I can not talk on dorm life as a personal experience, what I can say is my fellow classmates who live in dorms really do not complain much and the new state of the dorm building should be done for fall2012. It will be awesome. Plus plenty of opportunity to live off campus also., 973368=Lots of student orgs to join, may have to look around on the WIN website to find what you are interested in as there are so much and it is hard to find out about them all. May not be as close with the people in your org as you will other friends but that isn't true for all orgs on campus, 1101166=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 94332=Madison has a world-class faculty full of brilliant and interesting (my chemistry professor was in the 1992 Olympics) instructors. Also my first semester instructors were very open about providing help and keeping their office hours to explain any questions. Because it is a very intelligent and motivated student body, students push each other to learn.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students I think this school is great for people who want to work hard to get into a good school and continue to work hard in college. I would not recommend this school for people who can get distracted easily. Tips for prospective students Apply early, I really believe this will increase your chances of getting accepted and will get you a response a lot faster so you can make your decision. Really work to get a high ACT score and writing a good admissions essay. Bang for the buck Although this school is rather pricey for a public school I feel that it is definitely worth it. People are always impressed when they hear that I go to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, so I know that a degree from here will get me a great career. Am enjoying being here This campus and school has ALOT to offer, whether it be academically, socially, politically, or otherwise. Its location provides a perfect unison between city and campus life. The city is great, it's very active, and it's wonderful to see everyone out running, biking, shopping, walking down famous State St., etc. Am learning a lot",
