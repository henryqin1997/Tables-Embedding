For the past decade, there has been increasing use of liposomes for encapsulation and transfection of nucleic acids in vitro. Synthetic cationic lipids designed to limit the difficulties and dangers encountered with liposome-mediated transfection can be used to prepare liposomes for in vivo transfection of a gene encoding a marker (Felgner et al., 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84: 7413; Mackey, et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:8027-8031; and Ulmer et al., 1993, Science 259: 1745-1748). The use of cationic lipids may promote encapsulation of negatively charged nucleic acids, and also promote fusion with negatively charged cell membranes (Felgner and Ringold, 1989, Science 337:387-388). Particularly useful lipid compounds and compositions for transfer of nucleic acids are described in International Patent Publications WO95/18863 and WO96/17823, and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,127. The use of lipofection to introduce exogenous genes into the specific organs in vivo has certain practical advantages. Molecular targeting of liposomes to specific cells represents one area of benefit. It is clear that directing transfection to particular cell types would be particularly preferred in a tissue with cellular heterogeneity, such as pancreas, liver, kidney, and the brain. Lipids may be chemically coupled to other molecules for the purpose of targeting (Mackey, et al., 1988, supra). Targeted peptides, e.g., hormones or neurotransmitters, and proteins such as antibodies, or non-peptide molecules could be coupled to liposomes chemically., 429653=Ligands: The ecdysteroidal ligands ponasterone A and 20-hydroxyecdysone were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company and Invitrogen. The non-ecdysteroidal diacylhydrazine ligand N-(2-ethyl-3-methoxybenzoyl)-N\u2032-(3,5-dimethylbenzoyl)-N\u2032-tert-butylhydrazine (RG-102240, GS\ufffd-E ligand) is a synthetic stable ecdyecdysteroid ligand that was synthesized at Rohm and Haas Company. The non-ecdysteroidal, diacylhydrazine ligands RG-101691, RG-102362, RG-115840, RG-115853, RG-115855, RG-115859 and RG-115898 were synthesized by RheoGene Inc. The synthesis of RG-101691, RG-102362, RG-115840, RG-115859 and RG-115898 is described below. The synthesis of RG-115853 and RG-115855 is described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/775,883. The non-ecdysteroidal tetrahydroquinoline ligands RG-120499 and RG-120500 were synthesized by RheoGene, Inc. and were described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/460,820. All ligands were dissolved in DMSO., 186515=In another specific embodiment, the Group H nuclear receptor ligand binding domain comprising a substitution mutation is an ecdysone receptor ligand binding domain polypeptide comprising a substitution mutation, wherein the substitution mutation is selected from the group consisting of F48Y, F48W, F48L, F48N, F48R, F48K, I51M, I51N, I51L, T52M, T52V, T52L, T52E, T52P, T52R, T52W, T52G, T52Q, M54W, M54T, M92L, M92E, R95H, R95M, R95W, V96L, V96W, V96S, V96E, F109W, F109P, F109L, F109M, F109N, A110E, A110N, A110W, N119F, Y120W, Y120M, M125P, M125R, M125E, M125L, M125C, M125W, M125G, M1251, M125N, M125S, M125V, V128F, L132M, L132N, L132V, L132E, M219K, M219W, M219Y, M219A, L223K, L223R, L223Y, L234M, L2341, L234R, L234W, W238P, W238E, W238Y, W238M, W238L, N119F/V96T, T52V/A110P, V128F/A110P, V107I/Y127E/T52V, and V107I/Y127E/A110P substitution mutation of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another specific embodiment, the Group H nuclear receptor ligand binding domain comprising a substitution mutation is an ecdysone receptor ligand binding domain polypeptide comprising substitution mutation V107I/Y127E of SEQ ID NO: 1, which further comprises insertion mutation G259 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (V107I/Y127E/G259)., 104090=It is also possible to introduce a vector in vivo as a naked DNA plasmid (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,693,622, 5,589,466 and 5,580,859). Receptor-mediated DNA delivery approaches can also be used (Curiel et al., 1992, Hum. Gene Ther. 3: 147-154; and Wu and Wu, 1987, J. Biol. Chem. 262: 4429-4432)., 435988=2-(3-bromo-2-methyl-phenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-oxazole (3.4 g, 12.7 mmol) was dissolved in 30 mL of ethyl ether under nitrogen atmosphere in a 100 mL round bottom flask equipped with magnetic stirring, thermometer, and reflux condenser. Ni(dppp)Cl2 (100 mg) was added and the mixture was cooled to 0\ufffd C. in an ice bath. Ethyl magnesium bromide (5.5 mL, 3M in ether) was added, the reaction mixture was stirred at 0\ufffd C. for 30 minutes, at room temperature for 2\ufffd hours, and finally at reflux for 2 hours. The mixture was then cooled to 0\ufffd C., quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl. The organic layer was removed and the aqueous layer was extracted with ether. The organic phases were combined and dried over MgSO4. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give 2.84 g 2-(3-ethyl-2-methyl-phenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-oxazole, 1H NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz), \u03b4 (ppm): 7.5 (d, 2H), 7.2 (m, 2H), 4.1 (s, 2H), 2.7 (m, 2H), 2.45 (s, 3H), 1.4 (s, 6H), 1.2 (t, 3H), Rf=0.25 (4:1 hexane:ether), containing ca. 5% original aryl bromide. The oxazoline was suspended in 100 mL of 6N HCl and refluxed for 5 hours with vigorous stirring. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, whereupon 3-ethyl-2-methyl-benzoic acid crystallized: 1.74 g, m.p. 96-98\ufffd C., 1H NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz), \u03b4 (ppm): 7.85 (d, 1H), 7.4 (d, 1H), 7.22 (t, 1H), 2.7 (q, 2H), 2.6 (s, 3H), 1.21 (t, 3H). An additional 110 mg was recovered by ether extraction of the aqueous phase., 62568=Immunosuppressive molecules such as FK506, rapamycin and cyclosporine A can bind to immunophilins FKBP12, cyclophilin, etc. Using this information, a general strategy has been devised to bring together any two proteins simply by placing FK506 on each of the two proteins or by placing FK506 on one and cyclosporine A on another one. A synthetic homodimer of FK506 (FK1012) or a compound resulted from fusion of FK506-cyclosporine (FKCsA) can then be used to induce dimerization of these molecules (Spencer et al., 1993, Science 262: 1019-24; Belshaw et al., 1996 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 93: 4604-7). Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to FKBP12 and VP16 activator domain fused to cyclophilin, and FKCsA compound were used to show heterodimerization and activation of a reporter gene under the control of a promoter containing Gal4 binding sites. Unfortunately, this system includes immunosuppressants that can have unwanted side effects and therefore, limits its use for various mammalian gene switch applications., 253060=Acceptable ligands are any that modulate expression of the gene when binding of the DNA binding domain of the gene expression system according to the invention to the response element in the presence of the ligand results in activation or suppression of expression of the genes. Preferred ligands include an ecdysteroid, such as ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, ponasterone A, muristerone A, and the like, 9-cis-retinoic acid, synthetic analogs of retinoic acid, N,N\u2032-diacylhydrazines such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,013,836; 5,117,057; 5,530,028; 5,378,726; and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/775,883 and 10/787,906; dibenzoylalkyl cyanohydrazines such as those disclosed in European Application No. 461,809; N-alkyl-N,N\u2032-diaroylhydrazines such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,443; N-acyl-N-alkylcarbonylhydrazines such as those disclosed in European Application No. 234,994; N-aroyl-N-alkyl-N\u2032-aroylhydrazines such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,985,461; tetrahydroquinolines such as those disclosed in International Application No. PCT/US03/00915; each of which is incorporated herein by reference and other similar materials including 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-N-isobutyl-benzamide, 8-O-acetylharpagide, oxysterols, 22(R) hydroxycholesterol, 24(S) hydroxycholesterol, 25-epoxycholesterol, T0901317, 5-alpha-6-alpha-epoxycholesterol-3-sulfate (ECHS), 7-ketocholesterol-3-sulfate, farnesol, bile acids, 1,1-biphosphonate esters, Juvenile hormone III, and the like., 234412=In another specific embodiment, the present invention relates to an isolated polypeptide comprising a Group H nuclear receptor ligand binding domain comprising a substitution mutation that reduces non-ecdysteroid diacylhydrazine binding activity or non-ecdysteroid diacylhydrazine sensitivity of the Group H nuclear receptor ligand binding domain. Preferably, the isolated polypeptide comprises a substitution of an amino acid residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 48, 51, 52, 54, 92, 95, 96, 109, 120, 125, 219, 223, 234 or 238 of SEQ ID NO: 1. More preferably, the isolated polypeptide comprises a codon mutation that results in a substitution of a) an asparagine residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 48 or 109 of SEQ ID NO: 1, b) a leucine residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 51, 92, 96 or 238 of SEQ ID NO: 1, c) a glutamic acid residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 52, 92, 96, 125 or 238 of SEQ ID NO: 1, d) a tryptophan residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 54, 95, 96, 120 or 219 of SEQ ID NO: 1, e) a methionine residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 51, 52, 120, 234 or 238 of SEQ ID NO: 1, f) an alanine residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 219 of SEQ ID NO: 1, g) a lysine residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 48, 219 or 223 of SEQ ID NO: 1, h) an isoleucine, arginine or tryptophan residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 234 of SEQ ID NO: 1, i) a tyrosine residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 219 or 238 of SEQ ID NO: 1, j) an arginine residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 52 or 223 of SEQ ID NO: 1, k) a valine residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 125 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or l) a glycine or glutamine residue at a position equivalent or analogous to amino acid residue 52 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Even more preferably, the isolated polypeptide comprises a codon mutation that results in a substitution mutation of F48N, I51L, I51M, T52E, T52M, T52R, T52G, T52Q, M54W, M92L, M92E, R95W, V96W, V96E, V96L, F109N, Y120M, Y120W, M125E, M125V, M219A, M219K, M219W, M219Y, L223K, L223R, L234M, L2341, L234W, L234R, W238E, W238L, W238M or W238Y of SEQ ID NO: 1., 64260=Growth, molting, and development in insects are regulated by the ecdysone steroid hormone (molting hormone) and the juvenile hormones (Dhadialla, et al., 1998, Annu. Rev. Entomol. 43: 545-569). The molecular target for ecdysone in insects consists of at least ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle protein (USP). EcR is a member of the nuclear steroid receptor super family that is characterized by signature DNA and ligand binding domains, and an activation domain (Koelle et al. 1991, Cell, 67:59-77). EcR receptors are responsive to a number of ecdysteroidal compounds such as ponasterone A and muristerone A. Recently, non-steroidal compounds with ecdysteroid agonist activity have been described, including the commercially available insecticides tebufenozide and methoxyfenozide that are marketed world wide by Rohm and Haas Company (see International Patent Application No. PCT/EP96/00686 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,028). Both analogs have exceptional safety profiles to other organisms., 127468=A substitution mutation may be made by any technique for mutagenesis known in the art, including but not limited to, in vitro site-directed mutagenesis (Hutchinson, C., et al., 1978, J. Biol. Chem. 253: 6551; Zoller and Smith, 1984, DNA 3: 479-488; Oliphant et al., 1986, Gene 44: 177; Hutchinson et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83: 710), use of TAB\ufffd linkers (Pharmacia), restriction endonuclease digestion/fragment deletion and substitution, PCR-mediated/oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, and the like. PCR-based techniques are preferred for site-directed mutagenesis (see Higuchi, 1989, \u201cUsing PCR to Engineer DNA\u201d, in PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification, H. Erlich, ed., Stockton Press, Chapter 6, pp. 61-70)., 460274=2,2,5,6,6-Pentamethyl-hept-4-en-3-one (1.48 g, 8.1 mmol) was dissolved in n-butyl alcohol (20 mL). Then 5-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxine-6-carboxylic acid hydrazide (1.80 g, 8.1 mmol) and 10 drops of glacial acetic acid were added. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 20 hours (required for complete reaction) and monitored by TLC. To a solution of the intermediate 5-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxine-6-carboxylic acid (1-tert-butyl-3,4,4-trimethyl-pent-2-enylidene)-hydrazide were added 1.8 mL glacial acetic acid and 1.02 g (16.2 mmol) of sodium cyanoborohydride. The reaction was refluxed for three hours. The reaction was cooled and 50 mL of water and 10% aqueous NaOH were added until the reaction was basic (pH=ca. 14). Most of the alcohol was removed on a rotary evaporator and the residue was extracted with EtOAc. The aqueous extract was dried and concentrated to constant weight, yielding 4 g of a viscous material. 2.3 g pure 5-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxine-6-carboxylic acid N\u2032-(1-tert-butyl-3,4,4-trimethyl-pent-2-enyl)-hydrazide was obtained (yellow oil, Rf=0.30 in 25% EtOAc in n-Hexane, yield 73%) by column chromatography on silica gel. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 (ppm): 7.42 (br, 1H), 6.80 (d, J=8.4 Hz, 1H), 6.71 (d, J=8.4 Hz, 1H), 6.17 (br, 1H), 5.30 (dd, J=0.8, 10 Hz, 1H), 4.33-4.29 (m, 4H), 3.68 (d, J=10 Hz, 1H), 2.80 (m, 2H), 1.72 (s, 3H), 1.21 (s, 3H), 1.12 (s, 9H), 1.05 (s, 9H)., 462725=5-Ethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxine-6-carboxylic acid N\u2032-(1-tert-butyl-3,4,4-trimethyl-pent-2-enyl)-hydrazide (150 mg, 0.39 mmol) and 3,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzoyl chloride (83 mg, 0.39 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL CH2Cl2. 5 mL of 25% K2CO3 were added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction was monitored by TLC. The phases were separated, adding additional CH2Cl2 and/or water as needed to aid manipulation. The CH2Cl2 layer was dried and solvent was removed in vacuo to provide 210 mg of crude product. This material was purified by silica gel column chromatography, eluting with a step gradient of 10-25% ethyl acetate in hexane to yield 3,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-benzoic acid N-(1-tert-butyl-3,4,4-trimethyl-pent-2-enyl)-N\u2032-(5-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxine-6-carbonyl)-hydrazide RG115898 (83 mg, Rf=0.19 in 25% ethyl acetate in n-hexane, yield 38%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) \u03b4 (ppm): 10.19 (s, 1H), 6.75 (d, J=8.0 Hz, 1H), 6.69 (s, 2H), 6.61 (d, J=8.0 Hz, 1H), 5.43 (d, J=10.0 Hz, 1H), 5.41 (d, 14.4 Hz, 1H), 4.30-4.20 (m, 4H), 3.80 (s, 6H), 2.21-2.15 (m, 1H), 2.01 (s, 3H), 1.81 (m, 1H), 1.76-1.64 (m, 1H), 1.06 (s, 9H), 1.00 (s, 9H), 0.70 (t, J=7.6 Hz, 3H)., 302385=1.1\u2014GAL4CfEcR-DEF/VP16-\u03b2RXREF-LmRXREF: The wild-type D, E, and F domains from spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana EcR (\u201cCfEcR-DEF\u201d; SEQ ID NO: 21) were fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain (\u201cGal4DNABD\u201d or \u201cGal4 DBD\u201d; SEQ ID NO: 6) and placed under the control of a CMV promoter (SEQ ID NO: 2). Helices 1 through 8 of the EF domains from Homo sapiens RXR\u03b2 (\u201cHsRXR\u03b2-EF\u201d; nucleotides 1465 of SEQ ID NO: 3) and helices 9 through 12 of the EF domains of Locusta migratoria Ultraspiracle Protein (\u201cLmRXR-EF\u201d; nucleotides 403-630 of SEQ ID NO: 23) were fused to the transactivation domain from VP16 (\u201cVP16AD\u201d; SEQ ID NO: 12) and placed under the control of an SV40e promoter (SEQ ID NO: 22). Five consensus GAL4 response element binding sites (\u201c5XGAL4RE\u201d; comprising 5 copies of a GAL4RE comprising SEQ ID NO: 19) were fused to a synthetic TATA minimal promoter (SEQ ID NO: 24) and placed upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (SEQ ID NO: 25)., 213569=In another specific embodiment, the present invention relates to an isolated polynucleotide encoding a Group H nuclear receptor ligand binding domain comprising a substitution mutation, wherein the substitution mutation generally enhances non-ecdysteroid diacylhydrazine binding activity or non-ecdysteroid diacylhydrazine sensitivity of the Group H nuclear receptor ligand binding domain.

Such technology includes, for example, oligonucleotide chips and DNA microarrays. These techniques rely on DNA fragments or oligonucleotides which correspond to different genes or cDNAs which are immobilized on a solid support and hybridized to probes prepared from total mRNA pools extracted from cells, tissues, or whole organisms and converted to cDNA. Oligonucleotide chips are arrays of oligonucleotides synthesized on a substrate using photolithographic techniques. Chips have been produced which can analyze for up to 1700 genes. DNA microarrays are arrays of DNA samples, typically PCR products that are robotically printed onto a microscope slide. Each gene is analyzed by a full or partial-length target DNA sequence. Microarrays with up to 10,000 genes are now routinely prepared commercially. The primary difference between these two techniques is that oligonucleotide chips typically utilize 25-mer oligonucleotides which allow fractionation of short DNA molecules whereas the larger DNA targets of microarrays, approximately 1000 base pairs, may provide more sensitivity in fractionating complex DNA mixtures., 161226=An ecdysone receptor-based gene expression modulation system of the present invention may be either heterodimeric or homodimeric. A functional EcR complex generally refers to a heterodimeric protein complex consisting of two members of the steroid receptor family, an ecdysone receptor protein obtained from various insects, and an ultraspiracle (USP) protein or the vertebrate homolog of USP, retinoid X receptor protein (see Yao, et al. (1993) Nature 366: 476-479; Yao, et al., (1992) Cell 71: 63-72). However, the complex may also be a homodimer as detailed below. The functional ecdysteroid receptor complex may also include additional protein(s) such as immunophilins. Additional members of the steroid receptor family of proteins, known as transcriptional factors (such as DHR38 or betaFTZ-1), may also be ligand dependent or independent partners for EcR, USP, and/or RXR. Additionally, other cofactors may be required such as proteins generally known as coactivators (also termed adapters or mediators). These proteins do not bind sequence-specifically to DNA and are not involved in basal transcription. They may exert their effect on transcription activation through various mechanisms, including stimulation of DNA-binding of activators, by affecting chromatin structure, or by mediating activator-initiation complex interactions. Examples of such coactivators include RIP140, TIF1, RAP46/Bag-1, ARA70, SRC-1/NCoA-1, TIF2/GRIP/NCoA-2, ACTR/AIB1/RAC3/pCIP as well as the promiscuous coactivator C response element B binding protein, CBP/p300 (for review see Glass et al., Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 9: 222-232, 1997). Also, protein cofactors generally known as corepressors (also known as repressors, silencers, or silencing mediators) may be required to effectively inhibit transcriptional activation in the absence of ligand. These corepressors may interact with the unliganded ecdysone receptor to silence the activity at the response element. Current evidence suggests that the binding of ligand changes the conformation of the receptor, which results in release of the corepressor and recruitment of the above described coactivators, thereby abolishing their silencing activity. Examples of corepressors include N-CoR and SMRT (for review, see Horwitz et al. Mol. Endocrinol. 10: 1167-1177, 1996). These cofactors may either be endogenous within the cell or organism, or may be added exogenously as transgenes to be expressed in either a regulated or unregulated fashion. Homodimer complexes of the ecdysone receptor protein, USP, or RXR may also be functional under some circumstances., 87623=The appropriate stringency for hybridizing nucleic acids depends on the length of the nucleic acids and the degree of complementation, variables well known in the art. The greater the degree of similarity or homology between two nucleotide sequences, the greater the value of Tm for hybrids of nucleic acids having those sequences. The relative stability (corresponding to higher Tm) of nucleic acid hybridizations decreases in the following order: RNA: RNA, DNA: RNA, DNA: DNA. For hybrids of greater than 100 nucleotides in length, equations for calculating Tm have been derived (see Sambrook et al., supra, 9.50-0.51). For hybridization with shorter nucleic acids, i.e., oligonucleotides, the position of mismatches becomes more important, and the length of the oligonucleotide determines its specificity (see Sambrook et al., supra, 11.7-11.8)., 274975=In another preferred embodiment, the ligand for use in Applicants' method of modulating expression of gene is an ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, ponasterone A, muristerone A, an oxysterol, a 22(R) hydroxycholesterol, 24(S) hydroxycholesterol, 25-epoxycholesterol, T0901317, 5-alpha-6-alpha-epoxycholesterol-3-sulfate (ECHS), 7-ketocholesterol-3-sulfate, farnesol, bile acids, 1,1-biphosphonate esters, or Juvenile hormone III., 133225=Accordingly, the term \u201csequence similarity\u201d in all its grammatical forms refers to the degree of identity or correspondence between nucleic acid or amino acid sequences of proteins that may or may not share a common evolutionary origin (see Reeck et al., 1987, Cell 50:667)., 292746=Another approach uses recombinant bacteriophage to produce large libraries. Using the \u201cphage method\u201d [Scott and Smith, 1990, Science 249: 386-390 (1990); Cwirla, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.

An aqueous K2CO3 solution was prepared (4.15 g K2CO3/35 mL H2O) and added to the reaction mixture which was again cooled to 0\ufffd C. 3.63 g (16 mmol) of 5-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxine-6-carbonyl chloride were dissolved in 40 mL of CH2Cl2 and added from a separatory funnel, drop-wise over 15 min. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 days. The reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel with CH2Cl2 and H2O. The water phase was thoroughly extracted with CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 extract was then extracted with 0.5N HCl, dried, and evaporated. The residue was further dried in a vacuum oven to yield 5.15 g of a tan solid of N\u2032-(5-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxine-6-carbonyl)-hydrazinecarboxylic acid tert-butyl ester.

The mixture was cooled to 0\ufffd C. and treated with a solution of NaNO2 at 0\ufffd C. (2.8 g in 5.6 mL H2O). The resultant diazonium salt solution was slowly added to a preheated (60-70\ufffd C.) solution of CuBr (3.8 g) in 3.2 mL concentrated HBr. After the addition, the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and filtered. The recovered filter cake was washed first with water and then with 10% HCl, and dried in air to yield 6.93 g of 3-bromo-2-methylbenzoic acid as a light purple powdery solid. This material was dissolved in ethyl acetate, washed twice with 5% HCl, dried over Na2SO4, and recrystallized from 4:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate first at room temperature and then under refrigeration. 1H NMR (DMSO, 200 MHz), \u03b4 (ppm): 7.72 (dd, 2H), 7.2 (t, 1H), 2.5 (s, 3H)., 441165=A dry 3-neck 250 mL round bottom flask equipped with magnetic stirring and held under a nitrogen atmosphere was charged with 5.0 g 2-(3-bromo-2-methyl-phenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-oxazole, 60 mL anhydrous THF, and 100 mg Ni(dppp)Cl2. The mixture was cooled to 15\ufffd C., and isopropyl magnesium chloride (11 mL, 2M in ethyl ether) was added. A mild exotherm took place, and the mixture darkened slightly. The reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature, at which point 1H NMR indicated 50% completion. Addition of ca 75 mg Ni(dppp)Cl2 and reflux for 3 hours resulted in no further progression of the reaction. The mixture was cooled to 15\ufffd C., and an additional 13 mL of isopropyl magnesium chloride (2M in ethyl ether) and 100 mg of nickel catalyst were added and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl, the organic layer was removed, the aqueous layer was extracted, and the organic phases were combined and dried. The solvent was removed in vacuo to yield 3.84 g crude product as a yellow oil. Column chromatography on silica gel using 4:1 hexanes:ether as eluant yielded 0.79 g of 2-(3-isopropyl-2-methyl-phenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-oxazole as a colorless oil. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz), \u03b4 (ppm): 7.5 (d, 1H), 7.37 (d, 1H), 7.22 (t, 1H), 4.13 (s, 2H), 3.23 (m, 1H), 2.5 (s, 3H), 1.45 (s, 6H), 1.22 (d, 6H). The oxazoline was suspended in 34 mL of 6N HCl and refluxed in an oil bath for 6 hours. The mixture was cooled and extracted with CH2Cl2. The extract was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to yield 0.76 g of 3-isopropyl-2-methyl-benzoic acid, suitably pure for the next step. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz), \u03b4 (ppm): 7.8 (d, 1H), 7.48 (d, 1H), 7.3 (t, 1H), 3.3 (m, 1H), 2.55 (s, 3H), 1.2 (d, 6H)., 132499=As used herein, the term \u201chomologous\u201d in all its grammatical forms and spelling variations refers to the relationship between proteins that possess a \u201ccommon evolutionary origin,\u201d including proteins from superfamilies (e.g., the immunoglobulin superfamily) and homologous proteins from different species (e.g., myosin light chain, etc.) (Reeck et al., 1987, Cell 50: 667). Such proteins (and their encoding genes) have sequence homology, as reflected by their high degree of sequence similarity. However, in common usage and in the instant application, the term \u201chomologous,\u201d when modified with an adverb such as \u201chighly,\u201d may refer to sequence similarity and not a common evolutionary origin., 154806=In a specific example, binding of the ligand to the ligand binding domain of a Group H nuclear receptor and its nuclear receptor ligand binding domain partner enables expression or suppression of the gene. This mechanism does not exclude the potential for ligand binding to the Group H nuclear receptor (GHNR) or its partner, and the resulting formation of active homodimer complexes (e.g. GHNR+GHNR or partner+partner). Preferably, one or more of the receptor domains is varied producing a hybrid gene switch. Typically, one or more of the three domains, DBD, LBD, and transactivation domain, may be chosen from a source different than the source of the other domains so that the hybrid genes and the resulting hybrid proteins are optimized in the chosen host cell or organism for transactivating activity, complementary binding of the ligand, and recognition of a specific response element. In addition, the response element itself can be modified or substituted with response elements for other DNA binding protein domains such as the GAL4 protein from yeast (see Sadowski, et al. (1988), Nature, 335: 563-564) or LexA protein from Escherichia coli (see Brent and Ptashne (1985), Cell, 43: 729-736), or synthetic response elements specific for targeted interactions with proteins designed, modified, and selected for such specific interactions (see, for example, Kim, et al. (1997), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 94:3 616-3620) to accommodate hybrid receptors. Another advantage of two-hybrid systems is that they allow choice of a promoter used to drive the gene expression according to a desired end result. Such double control can be particularly important in areas of gene therapy, especially when cytotoxic proteins are produced, because both the timing of expression as well as the cells wherein expression occurs can be controlled. When genes, operably linked to a suitable promoter, are introduced into the cells of the subject, expression of the exogenous genes is controlled by the presence of the system of this invention. Promoters may be constitutively or inducibly regulated or may be tissue-specific (that is, expressed only in a particular type of cells) or specific to certain developmental stages of the organism., 101610=Vectors may be introduced into the desired host cells by methods known in the art, e.g., transfection, electroporation, microinjection, transduction, cell fusion, DEAE dextran, calcium phosphate precipitation, lipofection (lysosome fusion), use of a gene gun, or a DNA vector transporter (see, e.g., Wu et al., 1992, J.

Chem. 263: 14621-14624; and Hartmut et al., Canadian Patent Application No. 2,012,311, filed Mar. 15, 1990)., 444074=3-Isopropyl-2-methyl-benzoic acid (0.75 g) was refluxed in ca. 3 mL of thionyl chloride with a drop of DMF fro several hours and thionyl chloride was removed in vacuo to yield 3-isopropyl-2-methylbenzoyl chloride. The acid chloride was dissolved in 5 mL of CH2Cl2 and added slowly and simultaneously but separately with 5 mL of aqueous NaOH (0.265 g, 6.6 mmol) to a solution of 3,5-dimethyl-benzoic acid N-tert-butyl-hydrazide (0.973 g, 4.4 mmol) dissolved in 10 mL of CH2Cl2 prechilled to \u22125\ufffd C. During the addition, the temperature was kept below 5\ufffd C. The mixture was allowed to warm slowly to room temperature and was stirred overnight. The organic layer was removed and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic extracts were combined, dried, and solvent was removed in vacuo to give 1.61 g of crude product as a yellow oil.

Excess SOCl2 was removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in 20 mL of CH2Cl2 and added to an ice-chilled solution of 2-amino-2-methyl-propan-1-ol (8.74 g, 9.36 mL) in 20 mL of CH2Cl2. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours and the solvent was removed in vacuo to leave an oily residue. SOCl2 (7.4 mL, 100 mL, 3 eq.) was added to this residue over a period of one hour, the mixture was stirred an additional 30 min, and then poured into 150 mL of ether. An oily immiscible phase formed and the ether was discarded. The oil was mixed with 100 mL of 20% NaOH, and extracted with 3\ufffd150 mL portions of ether. The ether extracts were combined, dried over MgSO4, and the solvent was removed in vacuo to yield a yellow oil.

Later, Suhr et al., 1998 showed that non-ecdysteroidal ecdysone agonist, tebufenozide, induced high level of transactivation of reporter genes in mammalian cells through Bombyx mori EcR (BmEcR) in the absence of exogenous heterodimer partner., 133532=In a specific embodiment, two DNA sequences are \u201csubstantially homologous\u201d or \u201csubstantially similar\u201d when at least about 50% (preferably at least about 75%, and most preferably at least about 90 or 95%) of the nucleotides match over the defined length of the DNA sequences. Sequences that are substantially homologous can be identified by comparing the sequences using standard software available in sequence data banks, or in a Southern hybridization experiment under, for example, stringent conditions as defined for that particular system. Defining appropriate hybridization conditions is within the skill of the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra., 60858=The PR1-a promoter from tobacco is induced during the systemic acquired resistance response following pathogen attack. The use of PR1-a may be limited because it often responds to endogenous materials and external factors such as pathogens, UV-B radiation, and pollutants. Gene regulation systems based on promoters induced by heat shock, interferon and heavy metals have been described (Wurn et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 5414-5418; Arnheiter et al., 1990, Cell 62:51-61; Filmus et al., 1992, Nucleic Acids Research 20: 27550-27560). However, these systems have limitations due to their effect on expression of non-target genes. These systems are also leaky., 84085=A nucleic acid molecule is \u201chybridizable\u201d to another nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA, genomic DNA, or RNA, when a single stranded form of the nucleic acid molecule can anneal to the other nucleic acid molecule under the appropriate conditions of temperature and solution ionic strength (see Sambrook et al., 1989 infra). Hybridization and washing conditions are well known and exemplified in Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor (1989), particularly Chapter 11 and Table 11.1 therein (entirely incorporated herein by reference). The conditions of temperature and ionic strength determine the \u201cstringency\u201d of the hybridization., 451127=1.12 g (5.1 mmol) of 5-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxine-6-carboxylic acid hydrazide, 1.37 g (12 mmol) of 2,2 dimethyl pentanone-3, 30 mL of ethanol, and 20 drops of glacial acetic acid were refluxed for 6 hours to generate 5-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxine-6-carboxylic acid (1-ethyl-2,2-dimethyl-propylidene)-hydrazide, which was used in situ. To the cooled reaction mixture, was added 3 mL of glacial acetic acid and 0.63 g (10 mmol) of NaCNBH3. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. 25 mL of water were added and most of the alcohol was removed on a rotary evaporator. Then 10% NaOH/H2O was added until the reaction mixture was basic. The product was extracted with ethyl acetate, which was then dried and evaporated to give 1.61 g of residue. Pure 5-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxine-6-carboxylic acid N\u2032-(1-ethyl-2,2-dimethyl-propyl)-hydrazide was obtained (ca. 0.77 g) by column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with 25% ethyl acetate/hexane.
