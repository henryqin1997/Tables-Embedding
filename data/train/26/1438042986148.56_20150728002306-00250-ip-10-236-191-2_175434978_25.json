Tackled in these posts will be the offensive \"skill\" position groups: Quarterbacks, Running Backs, and Receivers/Tight Ends. My apologies go out to the offensive line, but it's very difficult to get o-line statistics, and more difficult to compare the groups. I used Python and Pandas almost exclusively for this quick trip to the past.\u00a0Any \"predictions\" can be described as unscientific, but kind of fun., 99301=Minnesota is a program that has turned it around under the Jerry Kill regime but in some corners of the universe the hype machine is a bit too high from this set of eyes; especially considering the offensive production lost to graduation.\u00a0 In Cowherd's terms I'd like to be a short seller of Minnesota Gophers football in 2015 while stuffing them in my 401k as a long term investment 12 months from now once the price cools down. \u00a0 Jerry Kill has very much installed a Jim Tressel / Mark Dantonio (until last year) blueprint of tough defense + running offense + special teams., 115411=Now, the idea that I think would be extra cool and would give us a lot more better matchups earlier in the season AND force schools to play teams of their own caliber, is the \"Challenge\" system. \u00a0Teams are matched up against teams from adjacently-seeded conferences for an early non-conference game, say in Week 1, 2, or 3. \u00a0The teams are matched up based upon the previous season's conference record. \u00a0The games will be at campus sites and will count just like any other game would. \u00a0Even seeds would host the games, so, for instance, the #2 seed from one conference would host the #1 team from another conference. \u00a0Every conference will participate except the Heartland 16 and the Sun Belt, since those conferences play 9 conference games. \u00a0The matchups will be set up accordingly shown in the tables below, and hypothetical matchups based upon the conclusion of the 2014 season are shown in those same tables.

Their season highlight was pulling a massive upset over Arizona State at home in November.\u00a0 Probably their 2nd best achievement was playing Utah tougher than UM did at home (sigh), falling in 2 OT.\u00a0\u00a0 But both those things happened at home - bad teams usually really suck on the road and Oregon State sure did.\u00a0\u00a0 They narrowly beat a 4 win Hawaii team and 2 win Colorado team on the road but when playing anyone with a heartbeat this is what happened:, 52443=Michigan baseball has a long tradition, being the oldest varsity sport, all the way back to that perfect 1866 team., 78660=But a team with heart, none bigger than the the co- MVPs, Mark Weber, and, Lary Sorenson, the starter who risked his arm and his future, for the team, when he threw back to back complete game victories one weekend in the spring of 1976., 118309=Along with 9 starters leaving from the defense, the best offensive players - QB Sean Mannion graduated.\u00a0 His backup decided to transfer.\u00a0 Leaving Oregon State to start one of 2 RS freshman or an unheralded true freshman.\u00a0 The UM game will only be career game 2 for whomever is a starter.\u00a0 The Beavers are also changing systems on offense from pro style to spread concepts - we remember how that worked out here in 2008., 41093=Ty Isaac is the outside challenger this year. After a decent freshman season with USC, Isaac transferred to Michigan, finally completing the Justin Fargas trade. Isaac's 2013 freshman season was similar to a few familiar names. \u00a0, 52137=This is a story of and from the 1976 UM baseball season., 146402=UM should win and win big.\u00a0 Even with all our questions on offense.\u00a0 The Beavers are an offense whose strength (running) plays into UM's perceived defensive strength.\u00a0 They look like they will probably be starting a true freshman in his 2nd game.\u00a0 And if not a RS FR who has never played.\u00a0 The returning offensive starters must learn a whole new offensive system and UM fans will remember how ugly that looked in 2008 at times. The defense should be Indiana-ish.\u00a0\u00a0 Oregon State will be coming off a game hosting awful Weber State (2-10 last year) - that might be their highlight of the year with the Pac 12 going to a 9 game schedule. The Beavers should be stuffed in AA., 54315=After Freehan left to be a Tigers Bonus Baby, the 1962 team finished second in the conference, but won the College World Series., 87267=To borrow Brian's style:\u00a0 \"Worry about 2015 prospects for UM if we are in in a dogfight anywhere past the 3rd ... err make it 2nd quarter. \"\u00a0 \"Be happy if Shane Morris or Gentry gets the entire 4th quarter.\", 52838=Even winning two national titles, in 1953, 61439=Ohio State rolled into town on Saturday, May 8 for two scheduled games, Weber to start the first and Sorensen the second., 53047=\"1953 University of Michigan baseball team (national champions)\" by Rentschler's Studio (Ann Arbor, Mich.) - Bentley Historical Library, Item BBT1953 -- http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhl/x-bbt1953/bbt1953.

The x-axis is the Class (1-freshman, 2-sophomore, etc) and the y is Yds/Carry., 54573=Don Lund then left as manager for another job in the athletic department and Milbry (Moby) Benedict took over as manager until 1979., 86452=June you were tantalizing...but you are wrong here., 74759=As in 1975, we won the rematch, this time, 9 to 3. McGinnis started, but was pulled with one out in the second inning, having surrendered the 3 Huron runs., 40527=The 2011 went 11-2 and won the Sugar Bowl. Shaw saw a small share of the rushing load with Denard, Fitz Toussaint, and junior Vincent Smith getting more carries. Carries were difficult to come by for Shaw behind these backs, a problem which will also be faced by Johnson. \u00a0, 15994=The 2001 team won 8 games and lost 4. Chris Perry split carries that year with B.J. Askew, who had a good season as well. At this point it's tough to see much separation between all four candidates for the feature back role. Barring a surprise breakout, this should translate to a running back by committee simply for the sake of fresh legs. \u00a0, 55630=1975 MVP starting pitcher Mark Weber returned, but #2 man Chuck Rogers was off to the pros and #3 starter Craig Forhan was off to UM law school., 85101=Disclaimer:\u00a0 My previews of non Big 10 teams are based on limited viewing of games of said teams from 2014 plus extensive reading of local and national previews of that team.\u00a0 I might be wrong in my assessment any one team or any specific unit of that team.\u00a0 But that's clearly doubtful.

Most impressive was his 5.2 yards/carry and the first of three straight 1,000 yd seasons. The 1985 team went 10-1-1 and finished ranked #2 in the country, with Morris being a large part of the offense. Past Wolverines show Smith to be the running back in the most prime position to break out., 17111=De'Veon Smith is another applicant for the feature back position. In the wake of losing Green to a broken clavicle, Smith saw the most carries on the 2014 team. However, Drake Johnson started stealing carries towards the end of the year before he too went down with an injury. Let's see to whom Smith is most comparable. \u00a0, 56723=After the pair of Boston Brave starters went 8 and 0 over a 12 day span in early September, 1948, a newspaperman wrote:, 135408=Luke Del Rio had 18 attempts as a QB in 2014.\u00a0 He decided to not stick around.\u00a0\u00a0 So the options at QB are 2 redshirt freshmen - Nick Mitchell or Marcus McMaryion or true freshman Seth Collins.\u00a0 Mitchell and McMaryion are your generic 800 to 1000th ranked 3 star type prospects.\u00a0\u00a0 Collins was a 2 star.\u00a0 It seems like early enrollee Collins is the current presumed leader as he is the 1 QB who was recruited for this new system.\u00a0 Good luck with that., 27954=Drake Johnson came on strong last season before going down with a knee injury. By all accounts he's been putting in the work to be ready for this season, and with his vision he is definitely in the hunt for the feature back role. Let's see who Johnson's 2014 season was reminiscent of. \u00a0, 55904=The 1976 team was shooting for UM's first back-to-back conference baseball titles since 1944-45.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 Michigan has an interesting mix of running backs this year. Junior backs Derrick Green and De'Veon Smith were highly rated coming out of high school, but neither have locked up the feature back role at this point. Drake Johnson is heading into his senior year after a promising junior season which unfortunately ended after a knee injury. Newly eligible Ty Isaac will be a RS sophomore after taking a year off following his transfer from USC. It's a crowded but talented backfield, and at this point, not much separates them. Let's take a look at their stats, gathered from sports-reference.com. Here are their stats throughout the years they have been active. \u00a0 \u00a0 Disclaimer: Obviously caveats do apply here. These are namely the effects of other position groups, coaching, and style of offense on the players being analyzed. Also, the past probably has no bearing on what current players will do, unless you believe Rust Cohle. I plan to deal with these issues by completely ignoring them. It's the off season, people. \u00a0 \"Time is a Flat Football\" is a series of posts which will explore players from Michigan football history members of the 2015 team resembles the most.

De'Veon Smith put up a relatively good season, especially considering he spent most of the year splitting carries with Green and Johnson. Isaac's freshman year at USC was good for a freshman back who was not the featured guy. Let's find some comparisons to past Michigan running backs from past years. \u00a0 \u00a0 Derrick Green Derrick Green Yr Cls Player Rush Att Rush Yds Rush Avg Rush Td Rec Rec Yds Rec Avg Rec Td Plays Tot Yds Tot Avg Tot TD Tot",
