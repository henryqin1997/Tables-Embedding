            "There are tons of clubs in the school and if you don't find something you like then they encourage you to start your own! There are lots of little competitions and games put on by the school or that the school is participating in. You just have to look to find fun things to do.",
            "The WiFi can sometimes be spotty but they keep it up pretty well.",
            "The teachers will help you but if you want to succeed you can't just go to class and go home, you need spend time just chatting with the professors about anything you can think of. Clubs and other meeting held in the school are also great ways to make the connections you'll need when you get out of school to get a job or even while in school to find an internship. You need to meet the school halfway or you wont reach your full potential.",
            "Awesome school, it has some really cool labs and other tech tools. The Cyber Cave especially has some awesome features and they take you through all of them."

Check out the Phoenix/Tempe area. There always an event going on, you'll never feel bored! Bang for the buck Even after graduation I will be excited to attend classes as an Alumi for no extra charge!
