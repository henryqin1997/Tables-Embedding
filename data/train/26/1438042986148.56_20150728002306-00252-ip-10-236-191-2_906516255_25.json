The construction may cause a bit of a mess in terms of parking but the new nursing building will be beautiful., 419723=TIP do not over take any classes, you will fail, it's not like highschool, take your education seriously since you're paying for it, it's a different life in college, it's difficult and not financially stable at times if you don't have everything sorted out, I didn't which is making things difficult, I don't even know if I'm getting the education I want for upcoming semester of Spring 2014. Do not procrastinate in turning in your FAFSA, make sure you talk to a counselor, do not be shy, it's your future, your goals, and your career you're wanting here.

Long Beach City college it's a really good school with the most helpful teachers. The staff are great as well and everyone is friendly. It has a really good learning environment and plenty of sources for you to succeed.}",
