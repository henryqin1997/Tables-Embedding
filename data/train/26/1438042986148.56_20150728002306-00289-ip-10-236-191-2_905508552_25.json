It's pretty well lit in most parking areas and there are always people around to walk with if you feel unsafe. I think the fact that there are nuns everywhere probably helps!}",

The admissions team and tour guides are amazing. They are always open to any type of questioning that may come to mind. Do not be hesitant in asking any type of questions because it is important that there is no guessing when learning about any institution. Bang for the buck Though the college comes at what some may see as a high cost, it truly is quiet the bargain. It is truly a steal to gain such an amazing education through an institution that is prices very low",
