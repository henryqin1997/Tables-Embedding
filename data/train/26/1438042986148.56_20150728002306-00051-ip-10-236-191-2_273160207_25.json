As you probally know, world-famous metal band Lamb of God is from Richmond. And you probably heard about singer Randy Blythe's arrest in Prague in 2012 on accusations of causing the death of a fan at a show there two years earlier. Randy was imprisoned for 5 weeks before his bail was finally granted & he returned home to Richmond. He did go back and stand trial and was acquited. His book on all these experiences, Dark Days, was just published this week. He's been on a book tour, and next Friday the new Lamb of God album comes out and an 8-week concert tour starts., 407613=Posted by DJ Ginger on 7/18/15 at 5:02 am, 5041=Posted by Erin Gerety on 7/28/15 at 11:57 pm, 465953=\u00a9 2015 WRIR Richmond Independent Radio | P.O.
