The small committee of politicians that draws those districts can choose which 26 percent will take power, and who will be able to run for office. So they control the machine that is supposed to produce a republic. Of course, their main priority is to maintain their grip on power. In November 2002, every single politician running for re-election to a state or federal office was successful., 17427=Sacramento used Choice Voting to elect its city council in 1921. Major J. W.

    "textBeforeTable": "So if 100 votes were cast: \u00a0 # winners + 1 total votes threshold = The formula for the winning threshold is: How much is enough? A candidate wins if his or her number of votes exceeds the minimum it could be without making it possible for too many candidates to win (that would be a majority in the case of a single-winner election). If each elected candidate reaches this level, then a majority of those elected represents a majority of the voting public. How does it work? We can accomplish this using the instant runoff procedure, but with an additional rule: we shuffle ballots at the beginning, and as soon as a candidate receives enough votes to win, we ignore anyone else's ranking of that candidate. This generalized method is known as Choice Voting. Choice Voting works cheaply and conveniently, because it collects all of the information necessary to determine a majority winner on one ballot. encourages positive campaigns, because candidates depend on the second All three of our goals for a republic can be satisfied when we are electing the state assembly, county boards, or city councils, because these legislative bodies are large enough that there is room for just about everyone's perspective to be represented.",
    "textAfterTable": "How well does it work? Choice Voting is used to elect the Cambridge, MA city council. Consistently, more than 90 percent of votes help elect a winner. A large majority receive their first choice, and rankings below 4th or 5th are almost never used. Usually, less than 3 percent show no support for any of the winners. A majority of the 9-seat council reflects a majority of voters. This chart shows a demonstration count of the 1999 Cambridge election using software developed by CfER members. Each color represents the share of votes for each elected candidate. The gray slice near the top represents candidates who did not help elect a winner (although most voters in that category do support a winner). \"Since becoming a resident of Cambridge in the 1950's, I have been fortunate to have always had a representative of my choice on the City Council and on the School Committee,\" writes voter John Moot. \"In contrast, I have never had a representative of my choice in the U.S. House of Representatives because I am a Republican in what was Tip O'Neill's and is now Joe Kennedy's district.\" Sacramento used Choice Voting to elect its city council in 1921.
