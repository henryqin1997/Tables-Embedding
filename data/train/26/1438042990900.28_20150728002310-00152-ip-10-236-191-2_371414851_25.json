    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{12258=Allen was drafted by the Chargers in the third round in 2013. A projected first-round pick, his stock fell as the result of a knee injury late in his senior season at Cal. During his first few months in San Diego, the coaching staff limited Allen\u2019s reps to make sure that he was fully recovered from the knee injury. Allen also found himself stacked behind a talented group of veteran wide receivers. At one point during training camp, he began questioning himself and his position with the team. He considered walking away to continue his education at Cal and pursue a career in his other field of dreams: music. Thankfully though, some tough talk and motherly advice from his mom, Doris, convinced Allen to hang in there. Around the same time, returning starter Danario Alexander went down with a knee injury and suddenly Allen found himself receiving more reps with the offense. Then in the Chargers\u2019 second game of the season in Philadelphia, Malcom Floyd suffered a season-ending neck injury. With Floyd out, Allen\u2019s number was called. On his second play, Allen caught an 18-yard pass on a 3rd-and-8 play that ignited a touchdown drive and a season that would end with Allen being celebrated center stage as the Pepsi Next NFL Rookie of the Year at New York City\u2019s Radio City Music Hall., 41892=Keenan Allen took the NFL by storm in 2013, earning NFL Rookie of the Year and NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors from multiple organizations., 8843=Long before the 2013 NFL Draft, Allen was a player coveted by Chargers General Manager Tom Telesco. In 2011, Telesco attended Cal\u2019s game against USC at San Francisco\u2019s AT&T Park and he noted that Allen really stood out on a field that was loaded with great players. Allen enjoyed one of the most prolific days of his career that evening against the Trojans, catching a career-best 13 passes for 160 yards., 10382=Allen went on to lead the team and set franchise rookie receiving records with 1,046 yards and 71 catches. He led all NFL rookies in catches, yards and touchdowns (eight), topping the 1,000-yard plateau during the Bolts\u2019 regular-season finale. He was just the fifth rookie since 2000 to rack up over 1,000 yards. In three games late in the season, Allen caught five touchdown passes, the most by a Chargers wide receiver in three games since 1996. It included an impressive two-game stretch in the course of five days when he caught two touchdowns against the New York Giants on Dec. 8 and two more at Denver on Dec. 12. Twice in 2013, Allen racked up more than 100 yards in back-to-back games, a feat that hadn\u2019t been achieved by a Chargers rookie since 1960., 9506=Allen\u2019s outstanding play continued into the postseason as he led the team with eight catches for 163 yards and two touchdowns. It included a 142-yard, two-touchdown performance in the divisional playoffs at Denver. It was the Chargers\u2019 second-most receiving yards ever in a playoff game and the team\u2019s first two-touchdown game in the playoffs since Jan. 1983 (Kellen Winslow). Allen\u2019s yardage total tied for the second-most by a rookie in a playoff game in NFL history (Keith Jackson, Philadelphia) and he became the league\u2019s first rookie since New England\u2019s Julian Edelman in Jan. 2010 with two touchdown catches in a postseason game., 8406=Allen left school after his junior season having caught a school-record 205 passes. His half-brother, Zach Maynard, was the quarterback all three years at Cal. Maynard originally enrolled at the University of Buffalo, but transferred to Cal so that he and Allen could play together. In 2011, the two combined for the longest pass play in school history when they hooked up on a 90-yard score against the Washington Huskies.\u00a0, 3056=COLLEGE: Honorable mention All-Pac-12 as
