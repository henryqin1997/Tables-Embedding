This is equivalent to 540 GB/s). All of these need to be pipelined during trigger execution, but only a subset is actually needed by the trigger, specifically 8-bit\ufffd6000 EM, 8-bit\ufffd1500 HAD, 1-bit\ufffd6000 preshower, and 2-bit\ufffd6000 PAD, corresponding to 390 GB/s (The above sum is 78,000-bit received by the 3D-Flow system every 25 ns. This is equivalent to 390 GB/s). In reality, the front-end electronics increases this amount to 690 GB/s, since some of the information needs to be duplicated in order to feed each trigger tower with the complete set of information relative to the solid angle it subtends. As an example, the information from each HCAL block has to be repeated four times, in order to make it available to each of the four ECAL blocks it covers. The figure of 690 GB/s is derived from providing every 25 ns each of the 6000 trigger towers with 8-bit ECAL, 8-bit HCAL, and 1-bit preshower and 6-bit PADs. In turns, this corresponds to a 23-bit word received at every bunch crossing by each processor in the stack, as shown in FIG. 8 (23-bit\ufffd6000=138,000-bit received by the 3D-Flow system every 25 ns, is equivalent to 690 GB/s).}",

The latter connectors have a key for mechanical alignment to facilitate board insertion. Of these, 1280 pins carry LVDS signals to neighboring 3D-Flow chips residing off-board in the North, East, West, and South directions; 48 pins are used for power and ground., 281609=On the rear of the board are assembled alternately four 200 pin AMP-9-352153-2 (see catalog AMP No. 65911, p. 14) connectors with three 176 pin AMP-9-352155-2 connectors. The latter connectors have a key for mechanical alignment to facilitate board insertion. Of these, 1280 pins carry LVDS signals to neighboring 3D-Flow chips residing off-board in the North, East, West, and South direction; 48 pins are used for power and ground., 286220=As another example, the CMS (see the CMS experiment at CERN, http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/doc/notes/docs/NOTE1998\u2014074 W. Smith, et al. \u201cCMS Calorimeter Level-1 Regional Trigger Conceptual Design.\u201d CMS NOTE-1998/074) calorimeter level-1 trigger (currently implemented in 19 crates (9U) using a different approach, while it will require only 5 crates (9U) if the 3D-Flow approach would be used), requires to receive only 18-bits from each trigger tower (electromagnetic, hadronic, fine grain, and characterization bit). Thus only 5 additional mezzanine fibers and receiver modules must be installed. One board can process 64 trigger towers and send to the global level-1 trigger decision unit the particles ID, time stamp and energy information of the particles validated locally by the trigger algorithm. Subsequently, it can provide the raw-data of the particles validated by the global level-1 trigger. This scheme has the advantage of flexibility: If the experiment later requires not only changing the level-0 (or level-1) trigger algorithm, but also increasing the number of bits (information) used in the level-0 (or level-1) trigger algorithm, this can be done without redesigning the hardware. In the case of the CMS calorimeter trigger algorithm, by using the digital processing board of the 3D-Flow approach, the user can, in the future increase, the number of bits from each trigger tower from 18 to 31 before being required to redesign the hardware., 66632=For all these applications, since there are no commercially available processors with an architecture suitable to these tasks, a 3D-Flow processor should be used with powerful I/O and instructions performing efficient data movement as described herein and in patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,937,202, 8/1999 Croseffo;, 272366=The board design presented here, based upon an 80 MHz processor, accommodates 64 trigger towers channels and processing layers. With the processor word 16-bit wide word, such a board can sustain an input bandwidth of 10.24 Gbyte/s (80 MHz\ufffd2 bytes\ufffd64) and process the received information on each of the 64 channels with zero dead-time and a real-time algorithm of the complexity up to 20 steps. (It should be considered that up to 26 different operations can be executed at each step, including efficient operations of data exchange with neighboring channels). With today's technology, it is not a problem to feed a 9U\ufffd5HP (1 U=44.45 mm; 1 HP=5.08 mm) board from the front panel with digital information at 10.24 Gbyte/s, e.g. the information could be received by the board using currently available deserializer/receivers links from several vendors at 1.2 GHz. Possible choices for such deserializer devices include Hewlett Packard HDMP-1024, HDMP-1034 @ 1.2 Gbps, AMCC quad serial backplane serializer/deserializer device with single and dual I/O S2064/S2065 @ 1.25 GHz, and from VITESSE). Alternatively, by using the deserializer from AMCC-S3044 @ 2.4 GHz (this device requires a minimum network interface processor that can be implemented in FPGA, Lucent Technologies TC 16\u2014Type 2.5 Gb/s optical transmitter/receiver with 16 channels @ 155 Mb/s serializer/deserializer, or the use of links soon to become available for the short range at 10 GHz that are already available for the long range in telecommunications (see Lucent Technologies and/or Nortel), may also solve this problem., 340135=The importance of flexibility and programmability for the trigger systems of today's sophisticated High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments has been recognized repeatedly. As a recent example, in an article presented at the 1998 workshop on electronics for LHC experiments1, Eric Eisenhandler states that \u201cTriggering of LHC experiments presents enormous and unprecedented technical challenges [and that] . . . first level or two of these trigger systems must work far too fast to rely on general-purpose microprocessors . . . Yet at the same time must be programmable . . ., 139926=All current indications and projections confirm that the evolution will continue to increase rapidly in the years to come. Furthermore, the traditional way of designing systems will change: the current productivity of about 100 gates per day (EE Times, Oct. '98) will need to improve substantially, in order to resist competition. Many statements in this regard have been reported by specialized magazines. Using today's methodology, a 12-million-gate ASIC would require 500 person-years to develop, at a cost in excess of $75 M. Companies will not be able to afford this cost, unless one develops IP blocks in order to build System On a Chip. Analog design retains its investment for several years, while digital design becomes outdated in about one year., 82934=A key element of the hardware construction is the node of communication that is in the backplane of the crate. This is crucial in understanding how the 3D-Flow construction simplifies hardware and cost, see detailed description in Section 5.6. A comparison of the backplane with existing systems (e.g., the trigger for CMS experiment at CERN, Geneva) shows how the new architecture realizes cost savings by reducing the number of board types from six to one, reducing the number of component types to a single type of ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit), and specifying a set of circuits downloadable in a single type of FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). Details of the hardware implementation are given in the articles: Crosetto, D., \u201cLHCb base-line level-0 trigger 3D-Flow implementation.\u201d Nuclear Instrument & Methods, NIM A, volume 436, issue 3, pp. 341\u2013385, 2 Nov. 1999, and Crosetto, D., \u201cDetailed design of the digital electronics interfacing detec., . . . \u201d LHCb 99-006, 30 Mar. 1999. http://lhcb.cern.ch/trigger/level0/3dflow/febr\u201417\u201499/lhcb\u201499\u2014006.pdf, 209176=The implementation for FPGA OR3T30 uses an internal PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) at 80 MHz. The circuit is different from the ASIC implementation. The FPGA implementation uses a different circuit made of the trigger-word formatter 32-bit register, connected to two 8-bit multiplexers 2:1, connected to two 8-bit registers, connected to one 8-bit multiplexer 2:1. The first set of multiplexers uses the clock at the \u201cselect\u201d input, the second set of 8-bit registers uses clock_x2 (@80 MHz) as strobe, and the last multiplexer uses clock_x2 at the \u201cselect\u201d input., 56146=This application claim priority of prior provisional application filed May 3, 1999, Ser. No. 60/132,294, entitled SYSTEM DESIGN AND VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR ELECTRONICS, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto., 374467=The following is an example of the use of the method and apparatus of this invention for applications in this field. The 3D-Flow system can input data from different detectors types: e.g. photo-multipliers coupled to crystals, or avalanche photo diodes coupled to crystal, multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC), silicon microstrip hodoscope (see patent 5,821,541, October, 1998, Tumer) and others. It can distinguish, track signals of different energy typically detected nowadays from different devices such as CT scan, PET, SPECT, etc. It can combine several medical imaging devices in a single instrument providing a combined 3D picture of the opacity of the tissues and of the biological methabolism occuring in real time in different parts of the body., 81326=For example a pipeline stage such as the one described in the Section 5.4.3.1 which is built with ten 3D-Flow layers executes a trigger algorithm for HEP experiments with a duration up to 250 ns. Compares to the current trigger systems (e.g. the report by J. Lackey, et al., \u201cCMS Calorimeter Level 1 Regional Trigger Conceptual Design.\u201d CMS note 1998/074, Nov. 13, 1998. http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/documents/98/note98\u2014074.pdf, and by The Atlas Technical Proposal CERN/LHCC/94-43, 15 Dec. 1994. HEP experiments at CERN, Geneva) designed to execute algorithms in one stage not to exceed 25 ns. The 3D-Flow implementation gives a 1000% performance increase. Twenty 3D-Flow layers will provide a 2000% performance increase., 372404=The above 167 million gamma rays used in a transmission test of the device as reported in the article cited above, is far from the maximum radiation given to the patient during exams. Depending on the radioisotope used, today's exams use water with 15O (half-life time is 2 minutes) for a brain study in a maximum dose of about 10 injections of 70 mCi each. This means the patient is exposed to less radiation (315 mrem), but also that 5,550 million photons/sec are generated to the PET, compared to 10 mCi of 18F-FDG which is a higher radiation dose to the patient (1,100 mrem), but generates only 740 million photons/sec (the half-life time of the FDG is 110 minutes). Given that 1 Ci=3.7 1010 Becquerel [Bq] or disintegration per second, one exam ranges from 370 million to 2,590 million disintegrations per second. Considering that one disintegration in this case is the annihilation of a positron with an electron generating two photons traveling at 180 degrees in the opposite direction, the hits of the true events to be detected by the detectors should be doubled. The above maximum figure is in the event that there will be a spherical detector that would cover the full solid angle around the radioactive source. However, PET is made of several rings of detectors (a cylinder of about 80 cm in diameter and about 15 to 25 cm long) which cover about 18 to 30% of the entire solid angle. In addition to the hits of the true events from the annihilation, the detector should have a bandwidth at least four times higher in order to handle the noise, the scattering, and the randoms., 55602=This application claim priority of prior provisional application filed Mar. 12, 1999, Ser. No. 60/112,130, entitled DESIGN REAL-TIME, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto., 331188=On one computer was installed the System Monitor program, while on the second computer was installed the Virtual Processing System program. The System Monitor was initializing and monitoring the VPS only through the 32 RS-232 serial ports. Control signals (3D-Flow system reset, input data strobe, etc.) to the VPS were generated by the System Monitor and sent through the standard COMI: of the two computers. The time one PC computer could execute all functions (loading, monitoring, etc.) on 1024 PEs was estimated by extrapolation (see Table 6)., 56779=This application claim priority of prior provisional application filed Jul. 14, 1999, Ser.

No. 60/170,565, entitled NOVEL INSTRUMENTATION FOR PET/SPECT SUITABLE FOR MULTIPLE DETECTOR TYPES, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto., 376087=The replacement of the electronics of the today's PET devices with the electronics described herein which implements the method of this invention to, is providing a 60 times less radiation to the patient or reduces to 1 minute (at the place of 60 minutes) the duration of an exam in the following manner: The description of two typical PET exam on humans with long duration are reported in two articles, one using the Siemens ECAT EXACT HR (JCAT, vol. 18, No. 1, 1994 pp. 110\u2013118) and another using the GE Advance (JNM Vol. 35, No. 8, August 1994, pp. 1398\u20131406). The Siemens PET exam acquired a total of 6 million counts per slice (in a total of 47 slices, less counts were acquired in the peripheral slices) over a 60 minutes scanning after injection of 10 mCi FDG. The GE PET acquired 3 million counts per plane for 20 minutes after injection of 8.5 mCi FDG. In the first case about 282 million counts (6 million counts\ufffd47 slices) have been acquired during the entire exam, while in the second case 105 million counts (3 million counts\ufffd35 planes) have been acquired during the entire exam., 57390=This application claim priority of prior provisional application filed Oct. 25, 1999, Ser. No. 60/161,458, entitled SYSTEM DESIGN AND VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR LHC TRIGGER ELECTRONICS, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto., 275254=The above deserializing/receiving components have matching components that can be found from the same vendors, which have the function of serializing/transmitting/multiplexing and optical fiber transmitting that are needed for transmission of the input data from the front-end electronics, or for the transmission of the output results from the 3D-Flow digital (or mixed-signal) processing board to the data acquisition system and higher level triggers. A few examples are: deserializer HDMP-1034, matched with serializer HDMP-1032, deserializer HDMP-1024, matched with serializer HDMP-1022, deserializer AMCC-S3044 coupled with the fiber optic receiver SDT8408-R matched with the serializer AMCC-S3043 coupled with the fiber optic transmitter SDT8028-T (this devices requires a minimum network interface processor that can be implemented in FPGA)., 276135=In the mixed signal application (option 1), only 80 analog signals (64 ECAL+16 HCAL, since each HCAL is equivalent to an area of 4 ECALs), converted to digital with 12-bit resolution in addition to 192 bits (1 preshower+2 Pads from muon station 1\ufffd64) are received by each board every 25 ns. This is not saturating the bandwidth of the 32-bit\ufffd64 channels=2048-bit every 25 ns bunch crossing that the 3D-Flow system could sustain., 263887=5.4.2.11 Physical Layout: a Single Type of Board for Several Applications., 284256=If on the other hand, 40-bit per bunch crossing per group of 64 were sufficient, then it would be simpler not to use the National Semiconductor serializer DS92LV1021, but rather have the North, East, West, or South ports of the 3D-Flow chip driver send the information directly to the global level-0 decision unit. In the present board, these serializer chips from National Semiconductor have been considered in order to make a conservative choice in terms of driving capabilities to three meters, while the 3D-Flow chip is required to drive only 1.5 meters on the LVDS I/O. The board consists of surface-mounted devices assembled on both sides, with some free space not covered by components., 107163=Trigger architectures such as the ones adopted and described in C. Beigbeder, et al., An Update of the 2\ufffd2 Implementation for the Level 0 Calorimeter Triggger. LHCb 99-007, 29 Apr. 1999. http://lhcb.cern.ch/notes/postscript/99notes/99-007.ps, from LAL-Orsay-France and J. Lackey, et al., \u201cCMS Calorimeter Level 1 Regional Trigger Conceptual Design.\u201d CMS note 1998/074, Nov. 13, 1998. http://cmsdoc.cem.ch/documents/98/note98\u2014074.pdf, from CMS-CERN, Geneva (as well as the other groups such as Bologna, Atlas, etc.) have used in their solution 1) and 2), while LAL opted also for 3), CMS makes the analysis on a larger area and had developed a 200 MHz GaAs 8-inputs 12-bit adder. Regardless, GaAs is not cost effective for common logical functions (it is more suitable for fast analog circuits, radiation-harded components, or for digital circuits @ GHz). Applications such as the one of CMS would have found a higher-performance and lower-cost solution using the 3D-Flow architecture which provides the possibility to execute algorithms requiring up to 250 ns and does not require special technologies such as GaAs., 269161=Purchasing about 2000 FPGA chips will provide maximum flexibility in downloading different circuits in the future. The complete design of the front-end electronics has been made for a) ASIC implementation, and b) FPGA implementation. For the ASIC implementation, all VHDL source files and test results have been provided., 267598=5.4.2.12 Front-End Hardware Summary, 55853=This application claim priority of prior provisional application filed Apr. 15, 1999, Ser.

No. 5,937,202, Ser. No. 10/1999, Crosetto and this patent application for a new implementation of the routing of data through the pyramid which require only the exchange of the data between three processors at each layer during the phase of channel reduction instead of the need to exchange of data among five processors)., 55266=This application claim priority of prior provisional application filed Feb. 16, 1999, Ser. No. 60/120,194, entitled IMPLEMENTATION OF FAST DATA PROCESSING WITH MIXED-SIGNAL AND PURELY DIGITAL 3D-FLOW PROCESSING BOARDS, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto., 273985=Should the transmission distance exceed 30 meters @ 1.2 GHz (only 10 meters can be achieved with acceptable Bit Error Rate\u2014BER\u2014for transmission over copper @ 2.4 Gbps), then the more expensive optical fibers receivers should be coupled to the components mentioned above. As one can notice from the type of components listed above, not all vendors provide devices with functions of deserializing/receiving/demultiplexing, separated from the functions of serializing/transmitting/multiplexing. The same situation occurs when one of the above components has to be coupled with a fiber optic receiver. Also in this case we may find vendors that offer both functions (optical fibers receiver/transmitter) in a single component at a lower cost in some cases than the price of a component with a single function. Some examples of matching the previous deserializer/receivers with optical fibers receivers (or receiver/transmitter) are: Hewlett Packard HDMP-1024 with the optical transreceiver HFCT-53D5, AMCC-S3044 with the fiber optic receiver SDT8408-R, Lucent Technologies deserializer TRCV012G5 with the optical fiber transreceiver Netlightl417JA. Connectors carrying several fibers are provided by many vendors (e.g. from Methode).}",
