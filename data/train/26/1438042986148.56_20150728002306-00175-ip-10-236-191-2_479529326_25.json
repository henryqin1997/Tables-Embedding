    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38601=Microcrystalline cellulose, sometimes called Cellulose Gel, is a naturally occurring cellulose that has been purified. The microcrystalline cellulose portion is coprocessed with an emulsifying agent called sodium stearoyl lactylate. When combined together, Avicel 1340 has an excellent stabilizing capacity for thermal exposure throughout product life. The emulsion surpassed Hot Box testing at 110\ufffd F. (1 month), and at 95\ufffd F. (3 months). In addition, Avicel 1340 promotes Freeze-Thaw stability. Avicel 1340 imparts minimal viscosity to the finished product., 39180=Purity gum CSC is a high viscosity modified food starch, derived from waxy maize, that can be used in many high pH food systems. It is a heat swelling and shear resistant starch, providing viscosity/thickness upon heat preparation. It is used in the invention in amounts of about 1to 12%, preferably 2to 7%. The starch remains inactive in the emulsified/concentrated sauce, but on heating increases in viscosity. It has a smooth short texture and will not set upon cooling. This product is described in Technical Service Bulletin 32087-311 from National Starch and Chemical Company., 41634=It has been found that the emulsion does have microbial kill and thus pasteurization is optional and the lack of heat improves the flavored freshness of the product. The preservatives employed are preferably sodium.benzoate and/or sodium sorbate but nisin, natamycin and other microbiological preservatives may also be used, from about 3000 ppm to about 5,000 ppm in the emulsion so that upon dilution, the amount of preservatives will be about 50 ppm to 1200 ppm. The pH employed is 4.5 or lower or even 3.5 or 3.0 depending on taste. It must be below about 4.6 which is the CFR limit for low acid food. Depending on the pH and flavor desired in the sauce, the buffer in the seasoning mix must be adjusted to control the pH for selected taste., 41144=Xanthan Gum provides protection properties for Avicel 1340. A discussion of the physical and chemical properties may be found in Industrial Gums, R. L. Whistler, Ed., academic Press, N.Y. (1973)., 37823=Purity gum 1773 is a modified food starch derived from waxy maize, having a unique emulsion stabilizing property. It is highly functional in emulsions of liquid foods containing fats and oils. This starch is used in the non dairy systems. It is cold water soluble and has high lipophilic properties resulting in excellent emulsion stability, as measured through centrifuge testing. In addition, Purity 1773 promotes Freeze-Thaw stability. In the system of the invention, this starch does not function as a bulking agent and does not add substantial viscosity to the concentrated sauce. This product is described in Technical Service Bulletin CGB093 from National Starch and Chemical Company. Other modified corn starches may also be used in the same amounts., 35946=The concentrate sauce, or stir sauce, can be fluid or paste and is a stabilized emulsion which contains about 20to 40% water, about 15to 40% oil, and about 25 to 65% solids, preferably 50% to 65%, which may be powders or other particulate solids. This includes about 2to 18% sodium chloride, preferably 8to 12% sodium chloride. An emulsifier, which may be egg (as commonly used and also as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,124), or other emulsifiers, at a level of about 1to 2% and Avicel 1340 at a level of 0.5to 5%. Avicel contains carboxy methyl cellulose and sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) in ratios of about 70/30. The Avicel combination is preferably used at about 0.5 to 1.0%. The sodium stearoyl lactylate may used at a level of 0.25to 2%. Carboxy methyl cellulose may also be used at a level of 0.5to 5%., 25992=This application claims the benefit of Provisional application Ser. No. 60/135,382, filed May 21, 1999., 164347=Inoculated sauce was maintained in a controlled temperature environment to simulate ambient at 23\ufffd C. Packets were analyzed destructively each day. Butterfield's Buffers (99ml) were used to prepare 1:10 dilutions. About 10 ml of buffer was added to each pouch to dilute the sauce and facilitate complete removal of sauce out of the pouch and into the buffer dilution blank., 37083=A lipophilic starch may also be used such as an N-CREAMER 46 or Purity gum 1773. These are used in amounts of 1to 5%, preferably 1.5to 2.5%, and provide dynamic shock sensitive stabilization, eg. As shown by centrifugation. Further emulsifiers could be TWEEN 60, polysorbate 60 or any food grade emulsifier at a level of about 1to 2% with an HLB of about 14to 25. The emulsification incorporates the oil droplets into the water. The stabilizer then keeps the emulsified droplets from coalescing or precipitating. In addition to the xanthan gum, other conventional gums may be used at similar levels such as propylene glycol alginate, pectin, guar, carageenan, gum arabic, gum tragacanth or indeed any salt resistant gum.}",
