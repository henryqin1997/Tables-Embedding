The keying statistics for some projects are not documented and thus are blank or are all zeroes/nulls here. Some older projects do not have a wiki page; their project titles show up in red. Those projects with 0% for every project statistical category were arbitrated (two people key every page, and an arbitrator chooses the correct keying for each field) rather than reviewed (one person keys every page, and an arbitrator reviews each field for correctness).
