Use the resources they have to offer you and springboard your higher education career! Bang for the buck Despite the tuition rise, I really thought that it was worth it. I did have a few problems (due to clerical error) with my scholarship a couple of times, but other than that I really enjoyed working with the cashiering staff to make sure my money was getting where it needed to go. Did enjoy being here Such a beautiful and fresh campus; I love walking around and taking in all the sites. :) There are so many trees and a great courtyard that I loved having picnics in. The new Allied Arts & Health building is also great!",
