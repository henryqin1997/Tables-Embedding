It's going to be a great place to eat during the 2014-2015 academic year., 7135=The education I am receiving here is excellent, York College was ranked number 13 among the best regional colleges in the North by U.S News 2011 Best College's Edition. For a private college, York is extremely affordable., 295589=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73255=My favorite teacher stayed in my dorm complex around 1995, so the complex I'm in is a little worn, but definitely a lot better than other college's I visited my senior year. But once you become an upperclassmen there are so many other great options for you!, 156771=Apply early. They offer an application that can be sent in during the Summer of your junior year in high school. It is a great opportunity to get information earlier and be able to meet with prospective professors. For example, I sent my 2012 application in August 2011 and received information in October 2011. I was able to meet with my professors from my major and I had already received my application status saying I was accepted. You do not have to accept the acceptance letter at that time., 141969=not big partiers. Students to like classrooms with a ratio of 1:18 or at most 20. Students that like a sense of belonging to a small community., 113305=There is a wide variety of clubs on campus. There are clubs for majors, causes, religions, and just for fun. They have something for everyone's desires. We also have a wide variety of sports, but no football team. We like to say undefeated since 1787 because we've never had one at all.}",

Tips for prospective students Make sure your work comes first, and you will be just fine. You shouldn't be here if you're not serious. Bang for the buck You are not paying a lot to be here but you are definately getting your monies worth. It's a wonderful learning environment and you are sure to have a blast. Am enjoying being here There is always something to do around campus. Concerts, Relay for Life, club sports, collegiate sports, a brand new, amazing workout center complete with rock climbing wall. Not to mention the fraternities and sororities which are always doing something. Am learning a lot",
