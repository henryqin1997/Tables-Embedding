            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DECOMPOSING I/O TASKS IN A RAID SYSTEM - A data access request to a file system is decomposed into a plurality of lower-level I/O tasks. A logical combination of physical storage components is represented as a hierarchical set of objects. A parent I/O task is generated from a first object in response to the data access request. A child I/O task is generated from a second object to implement a portion of the parent I/O task. The parent I/O task is suspended until the child I/O task completes. The child I/O task is executed in response to an occurrence of an event that a resource required by the child I/O task is available. The parent I/O task is resumed upon an event indicating completion of the child I/O task. Scheduling of any child I/O task is not conditional on execution of the parent I/O task, and a state diagram regulates the child I/O tasks.",
            "LOCATION-INDEPENDENT RAID GROUP VIRTUAL BLOCK MANAGEMENT - A computer storage system is described. A range of volume block numbers (VBNs) is assigned to a volume. A range of storage device block numbers (DBNs) is assigned to each of a plurality of storage devices. A first mapping parameters are created to map a first range of VBN numbers to a first selected range of DBNs using a first portion of a new storage device. A second mapping parameters are created to map a second range of VBN numbers to a second range of DBNs on a second portion of the new storage device.",

In one scheme, packet filters may be performed with multiple operations, if needed. The operation(s) to be performed and the order of performing the operation(s) may be dependent on the number of existing packet filters to be replaced (N) and the number of new packet filters (M). If N=M, then N packet filters in a traffic filter template may be replaced with a single operation. If N>M, then M packet filters in the traffic filter template may be replaced first, and N\u2212M packet filters may be deleted from the traffic filter template next.

A method includes receiving a command to create a parameter definition for a PLM object. The method includes, in response to the command, creating a table definition object and a table object based on the table definition object. The method includes creating at least one cell associated with the table object of an object type that describes an object parameter, and using the table object as an attribute of the parameter definition. 07-21-2011 Tarun Viswanathan, Folsom, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20140007086 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR VIRTUAL MACHINE INTEROPERABILITY 01-02-2014 20140189777 POLICY-BASED SECURE CONTAINERS FOR MULTIPLE ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS - Technologies for providing policy-based secure containers for multiple enterprise applications include a client computing device and an enterprise policy server.
