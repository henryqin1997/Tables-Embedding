It is being used for photography classes and is highly anticipated. The center of the campus is the most beautiful, it looks like a large park. The campus library overlooks a water feature onto a patio with tables for students and further out a nice grassy area surrounded by several trees. It really creates a nice environment on campus and makes it feel warm and safe and welcoming., 44401=this is only my second semester attending crc and so far so great. last semester, fall 2011, did serve as a challenge because of family problems but it did not stop me from giving my best. my schedule was open and allowed me to focus on homework and/or study. the classes were fairly easy despite some factors., 130958=The tuition is going up, however the campus is expanding and new building is being made this year (2012-13) as well as a new parking structure with a light rail connected to the campus., 214578=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
