            "PHYSIOLOGICAL STATUS INDICATOR APPARATUS AND METHOD - A processor circuit can be configured to obtain a first multidimensional vector. The first multidimensional vector can include dimensions corresponding to respective first conductivity characteristics obtained from different implantable electrode configurations associated with a subject. The processor circuit can also be configured to obtain a second multidimensional vector or vector space. The second multidimensional vector or vector space can include dimensions corresponding to respective second conductivity characteristics obtained from such different electrode configurations associated with the same or a different subject. The processor circuit can also provide a physiological status indicator that can be obtained at least in part by performing a vector comparison of the first multidimensional vector to the second multidimensional vector space or vector.",
            "SHUNTING OF DIETARY LIPIDS INCLUDING CHOLESTEROL - Methods and devices for redirecting at least a portion of a fluid from the mesenteric lymphatic system for elimination from the body are disclosed. The fluid may be redirected for elimination through the urinary system or redirected outside the body. The methods and devices disclosed may prevent a portion of a patient's dietary lipids, including cholesterol, from being absorbed, thereby reducing the total caloric load to assist in weight management."

A flexure in accordance with one embodiment of the invention includes an insulating layer, a plurality of traces on the insulating layer and a stainless steel base layer on the side of the insulating layer opposite the traces. The stainless steel base layer includes one or more void portions with voids in the base layer opposite the insulating layer from the traces and one or more backed portions with the base layer backing the traces. A plurality of patterned and transversely-spaced first conductive ground planes are located opposite the insulating layer from the traces at the void portions and backed portions of the stainless steel base layer. A continuous gold second conductive ground plane is located opposite the insulating layer and the first ground planes from the side of the insulating layer adjacent to the traces at the void portions and backed portions of the stainless steel base layer. The gold ground plane can be used as an etch stop during formation of the voids in",
