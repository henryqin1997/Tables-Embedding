There's also a soup and salad bar available. Food is difficult to rate because it depends on people's taste however II love the Mexican bar. The snacker, is a small open burrito, it's only $3. I'm on tight budget so whenever I forget to pack lunch i buy the snacker. Jazzman (cafe) is on the bottom floor of the library and its open until 2:00 a.m. Very convenient when studying late!, 259435=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 243813=No one enters campus without ID after 7:00 p.m, 135333=Every Tuesday and Thursday we have something called Convo which is from 12-1:30, where no one has classes. There are food trucks, free food, a farmer's market, and booths set up by different people. The first and last ones are really fun because they have a lot of activities and free giveaways.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here There is nothing better than a beautiful campus with an even more beautiful view. The campus and people are so relaxed. Don't be surprised if you see a few people tanning outside in the summer months. Its hard to miss home when your school has more palm trees than a vacation resort. Convo hour (Tuesdays and Thursdays 12-1) is by far the best idea I have ever heard of on a college campus. There is nothing better than a school wide hour without classes, not to mention the concerts, fairs, and yard sales. Am learning a lot The professors are all very down to earth. Professors here understand what information and knowledge is needed in the real world and wont try to fill your head up with unnecessary jargon.
