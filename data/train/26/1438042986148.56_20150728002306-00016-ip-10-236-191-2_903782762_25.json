            "They have a ton of clubs you can join! Which is nice!",
            "It's great for students who aren't ready to attend a university just yet and are fresh out of high school. It helps students get from high school into college easily without a huge change.",
            "For what you pay to attend here, you get your moneys worth. It is a cheap college that will definitely help you save money.",
            "I was not impressed by the food offered at College of Central Florida.",
            "I did not live on campus, I lived with my parents who are less than 15 minutes away from the college. Therefore, I cannot answer that.",
            "Again, I was not personally challenged enough here. I am currently enrolled in seven summer courses (which are minimesters) And do not feel stressed in the least!",
            "Challenge yourself and make yourself do the work even if you know the professor won't check or inspect it! You will learn more that way!",
            "I would rate the College of Central Florida with a 7 out of a possible 10 points. I found that most of my professors were extremely kind and knowledgeable; however, I did not personally feel challenged enough in my academics."

Silver Springs with their glass bottom boats, and Wild Waters with the water slides and pools, as well as the Gulf Beaches, Crystal River's manatees, and numerous caves for cave diving are all nearby.

    "textAfterTable": "The food they serve in the cafeteria actually exceeded my expectations. It is much better than the food I have been offered at my previous schools. They have a lot of variety and serve all three meal courses throughout the day. Dorm Life I am not currently living in a dorm. I know people that do live in dorms because they wanted a restricted environment. They recommend living in one because they could still focus on their schooling and not get lost in the party life that college can offer. Academic Rigor It depends on the degree you are looking to obtain. At a community college you are basically taking your essential classes that every student is required to take. However, some classes that relate to your major can be a little more difficult because they are specific curriculum. Tips for prospective students I would recommend a student to get involved in their school even if it is a community college or a university. It helps them feel more included in their school's activities, which in turn will aid their networking skills. Also, they will find peers that they can relate too and will create even more friendships than they had before.",
