Since then, George Mason has been back to the NCAAs once, in 2008, incurring a Round of 64 loss to Notre Dame. \u2022 George Mason was picked eighth in the 13-team Atlantic 10 preseason poll. Guard Sherrod Wright was a second-team preseason all-league pick. \u2022 The Patriots started the season with four wins but lost to Iona 89-73 last time out Saturday afternoon. GMU had a rough start, falling behind 34-5 12 minutes in and as much as 32 points at 72-40 past the midway point of the second half. After the 34-5 deficit, the Patriots never got closer than 15 points. Iona shot 50 percent (31-62) to GMU's 40.3 percent (25-62) and turned the ball over four fewer times, 15-11. \u2022 George Mason's first Division I season was in 1978-79. The Patriots are 4-0 all-time against the Ivy League: an 89-52 win on Nov. 17, 2008 at Brown, a 60-44 home win on Nov. 15, 2009 over Dartmouth, a 66-53 home win on Nov. 13, 2010 over Harvard, and a 74-48 home win on Nov. 21, 2011 over Brown. The Patriots will face one more Ivy team this season when they host Penn on Jan. 2. \u2022 Paul Hewitt is in his third season at the helm at George Mason after taking over when Jim Larranaga, the coach who took George Mason to the 2006 Final Four, took over at Miami (Fla.). The Patriots are 50-26 under Hewitt, whose first postseason appearance with the team resulted in a 4-2 run to the CBI finals last year. \u2022 Sherrod Wright was the team's only double-figure scorer a year ago, averaging 16.6 ppg. The Patriots return 90.5 percent of their scoring from last season, including their top seven leading scorers. Their second leading scorer last season, Jonathan Arledge, who averaged 9.0 ppg last season, played only in the first game this season. \u2022 Marko Gujanicic, a 6-8 sophomore from Serbia who went to high school in Southern California, has made a big leap so far this season. He averaged 5.3 ppg and 3.7 rpg last season and is averaging 12.6 ppg and a team-best 7.8 rpg so far this season. Erik Copes, a 6-8 junior who led the team in rebounding last season at 6.0 rpg, has not played this season. \u2022 Seven players have started a game for GMU in the five games so far. Johnny Williams, a 6-8 senior forward, Sherrod Wright, a 6-4 senior guard, and Corey Edwards, a 5-11 junior guard, have started all five games. The Patriots have used three starting lineups this season, most recently returning to a lineup of Williams, Gujanicic, 6-3 senior guard Bryon Allen, Wright, and Edwards against Iona after using that lineup in the second game against Lamar. Allen replaced 6-1 sophomore guard Patrick Holloway, who started the two games previous to Iona. \u2022 Through Saturday night's games, George Mason was 13th in the 13-team A-10 in scoring at 67.6 ppg but was third-best in the league in scoring defense at 63.8 ppg allowed., 36019=\u2022 Princeton is 3-1 through the first four games for the first time since the 2009-10 season. With a win or loss against George Mason, it would still be Princeton's best record through five games since the 2006-07 season. If the Tigers can win against George Mason and Bucknell, they'd be 5-1 for the first time since Mitch Henderson's senior season of 1997-98. \u2022 It is the first meeting between Princeton and George Mason. Neither George Mason's Paul Hewitt nor Mitch Henderson has coached against the other program whether as a head coach or an assistant. \u2022 The Tigers are in the third game of four straight in which the opposing coach has been a head coach in the NCAA Tournament. Lafayette's Fran O'Hanlon coached the Leopards in the dance in 1999 and 2000, Rice's Ben Braun coached Eastern Michigan and Cal a combined eight visits in the tournament, including with the Bears in 1997 against then-junior Mitch Henderson's Tigers, while Paul Hewitt coached Siena and Georgia Tech a combined six times, including a 2004 NCAA final defeat against UConn with the Yellow Jackets. Saturday, the Tigers will square off against Dave Paulsen, who's guided Bucknell to the bracket in 2011 and 2013. \u2022 George Mason is in its first season in the Atlantic 10. Princeton's last game against an school in the A-10 at the time of the game was the 63-60 loss to Fordham last season at the Barclays Center, and the last game before that was a win over Saint Joseph's in Jadwin Gym on Dec. 5, 2010. \u2022 George Mason will face two other teams this season that are coached by Princeton alums. The Patriots beat American, coached by Mike Brennan '94, 63-60 in the season opener on Nov. 8, and will host Richmond, coached by Chris Mooney '94, on Feb. 26. \u2022 The last time Princeton played a team from Virginia was on Nov. 22, 2010, a 65-64 loss at James Madison. The last time a Virginia team played in Jadwin Gym was on Jan. 6, 1976, when the Tigers beat William & Mary 64-43. Princeton has had a limited history against the Old Dominion State, going 3-0 all-time against William & Mary, 2-0 against Virginia, 2-0 against VMI and 0-1 against JMU. The win over the Keydets is also Princeton's last win over a Virginia team, coming Nov. 11, 2006 in Columbus, Ohio. That was the first time Princeton faced a Virginia team since 1977. The Tigers will make it two new Virginia foes this season when they visit Liberty on Jan. 4. \u2022 Princeton's second-leading scorer in program history is a native Virginian, as Ian Hummer '13 is from Vienna, Va., a neighbor to the Patriot Center's location in Fairfax, Va. \u2022 Princeton has a connection with George Mason's new A-10 rival Richmond, as Chris Mooney '94 is the Spiders' head coach and current Tiger assistant Marcus Jenkins worked under Mooney at Richmond before coming to Princeton. \u2022 Princeton has scored 285 points so far this season, an average of 71.2 ppg. It's the most points Princeton has scored through four games since the 1987-88 season, when the Tigers had 288 points through four games. One of those games was against Franklin & Marshall, so the Tigers' 285 this year is the most against four Division I teams since the 1971-72 season, when the team had 340 points through games against Rutgers, Penn State, No. 2 North Carolina and No. 18 Villanova. \u2022 Princeton is facing two straight teams who have proven themselves tough defensively on the perimeter. Rice held Princeton to a .323 (10-31) clip Saturday, bumping its average allowed up to .271, and George Mason is holding opponents to .278 from distance. George Mason has not allowed a team to make more than nine 3-pointers in a game so far, but the Tigers have made at least 10 in three of four games this season and never fewer than eight. \u2022 On the subject of 3s, Princeton is averaging 11 of 27 from distance and is 42 of 108 on the year. The Tigers haven't made 42 3s in their first four games of a season since the 1998-99 season, when they also had 42, and the 108 3s tried are the most since the start of the 2000-01 season, when the team put up 110 through four games. Then-senior, now assistant coach Brian Earl had 13 of those 42 3s in the first four games of '98-'99. \u2022 Of Princeton's 210 field goal attempts this season, 108, or 51.4 percent, have been from beyond the arc. Seven players have more tries from beyond the arc than from inside, including Will Barrett (18 of 26), Ben Hazel (21-27), Spencer Weisz (14-20), T.J. Bray (5-6), Jimmy Sherburne (10-18), Chris Clement (9-11) and Clay Wilson (2-2). \u2022 George Mason is outrebounding its opponents by 7.0 rpg through the first five contests. The Tigers have outrebounded three of their first four opponents, and the Patriots outrebounded their first four opponents by between 7 and 11 boards before being even on the glass with Iona last time out. \u2022 There's a long way to go, but Princeton has three players averaging double-figure points, something Princeton hasn't ended a season with since the 2010-11 campaign when Dan Mavraides '11, Kareem Maddox '11, Douglas Davis '12 and Ian Hummer '13 did so. Denton Koon (13.3 ppg), Will Barrett (11.5) and Hans Brase (11.5) are 10-plus so far this season. \u2022 Through Sunday's games, Princeton is No. 1 in the Ivy League in assist-to-turnover ratio at 1.4:1 and in 3s per game at 10.5, better than second-place Dartmouth's 8.7. The Tigers aren't last in the league in any category. Jimmy Sherburne is the league's top free throw shooter at a perfect 8 for 8, and the Tigers have four of the top 10 3-point shooters by field goal percentage in Will Barrett (9-18, .500), Chris Clement (4-9, .444), Ben Hazel (9-21, .429), and Spencer Weisz (6-14, .429). Princeton has two of the top seven minute loggers in the league, with Ben Hazel (2nd, 33.5 mpg) and Spencer Weisz (7th, 31.0). \u2022 The Tigers have used the same starting lineup in all four games, with 6-10 senior Will Barrett, 6-8 sophomore Hans Brase, 6-3 senior Jimmy Sherburne, 6-5 junior Ben Hazel and 6-4 freshman Spencer Weisz getting the nod. \u2022 Princeton returns nearly 75 percent of its scoring from a year ago despite graduating reigning Ivy Player of the Year Ian Hummer \u201913. The team also returns 71 percent of its starts and 67 percent of its minutes, with Denton Koon, T.J. Bray, Will Barrett and Hans Brase all having started at least 18 games last season. \u2022 Forty percent of Princeton's points this season have been scored by players who weren't on the 2012-13 roster, including Spencer Weisz (9.3 ppg), Ben Hazel (9.3 ppg),\u00a0Jimmy Sherburne (8.0 ppg), Peter Miller (1.3 ppg) and Steven Cook (0.7 ppg). Hazel, a junior, and Sherburne, a senior, took the 2012-13 season off. \u2022 The Tigers have a six-member freshman class and five of them have seen game action, including Khyan Rayner, Hashim Moore, Steven Cook, Peter Miller and Spencer Weisz. Miller has played in all four games, and Weisz has started all four., 17000=at Bucknell, Sat., Nov. 30 in Lewisburg, Pa.
