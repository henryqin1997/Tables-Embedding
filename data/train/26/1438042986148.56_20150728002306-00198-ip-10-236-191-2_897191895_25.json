    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students North Lake is good for people that want to get their basics done or older people that are going back to school. It is a diverse campus so anyone can join and should feel comfortable. Tips for prospective students Find people you know and ask what teachers are good. There are some really cool teachers and some really boring teachers. You will do good if you study lots and get the good teachers. Bang for the buck North Lake is pretty cheep, especially if you live in District if you live out of district like me about $20 dollars more. Am enjoying being here I really like North Lake, because there are many clubs and activities you can join. The campus is pretty large and not just one building like NCTC. The campus is clean and is nice for a older campus. Am learning a lot I am learning a lot at North Lake. The professors are all pretty nice and seem to really want to help you succeed. If you go to class and study, you will do fine.",
