Most proximity sensors emit an electromagnetic field or beam and look for changes in the field. The object being sensed is called a target. Different targets demand different sensors. For example, a capacitive or photoelectric sensor might Proximity sensors for stamping dies Difficulties that plague die-stamping operations include overfeeds, underfeeds, slugs, and missed hits. This flat-pack proximity sensor tells a controller that the die has closed properly. A spacer plate under the sensor raises it to the correct detection height for this die. Proximity sensors head Old School Proximity Sensor Implementation their detection faces. Whenever a detectable object moves into the sensor's field of detection, Eddy currents build up in the target and dampen the sensor's magnetic field. This effect triggers the sensor's output. Since a current in the target is needed for detection, inductive proximity sensors are uniquely Selecting proximity sensors for diverse applications Proximity sensors provide high-quality performance for an evolving range of applications. Operating Principles for Capacitive Proximity Sensors Capacitive proximity sensors are used for non-contact detection of metallic",
