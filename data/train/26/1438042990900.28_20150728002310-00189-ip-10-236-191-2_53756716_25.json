Ray Rice, though, answered three minutes later, breaking through the clutches of a couple would-be tacklers and surging down the left sideline for a 22-yard touchdown., 49000=Favre threw three touchdown passes, including a pair to Visanthe Shiancoe, for the Vikings, who are off to their first 6-0 start since 2003. Favre finished with 278 yards on 21-of-29 efficiency, while Adrian Peterson rushed for 143 yards on 22 carries., 48076=The Vikings watched a seemingly comfortable 17-point fourth-quarter lead evaporate and trailed 31-30 after Baltimore's Ray Rice scored on a 33-yard touchdown run with 3:37 remaining., 51524=Minnesota got the ball to begin the game, and Favre led the Vikings on a six- play, 61-yard march that culminated with a 19-yard scoring strike to Shiancoe, his fourth touchdown reception of the season.}",
