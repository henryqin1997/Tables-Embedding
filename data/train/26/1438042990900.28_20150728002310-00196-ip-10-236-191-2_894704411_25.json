With fully-trained police officers monitoring Portland and Gorham 24/7, and a 24/7 hotline to call staffed with live operators, students are never out of touch with USM PD. Parking tickets may be the only part of campus safety students complain about, but it is worth the $15 fee to have such an incredibly safe school., 144935=The sad truth is that the University invests little money in its housing. Aside from the two newer halls, erected in 2003 and 2007, the residence halls are outdated and in dire need of upkeep. Simple things like burnt light bulbs or a broken screen can take weeks to get repaired. Additionally, the accountability for student Residence staff is at a low - thus chance to feel part of a community is shifting from the role of the RA to that of living learning communities designed to assign students to live with similar individuals.}",

No questions asked, I thought the people would just treat me like dirt because I didn't know how to add/drop a class or maybe didn't know where to go. But all in all, the people really step it up here at USM, and not just the teachers, but the students as well.
