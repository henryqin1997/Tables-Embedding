A decent 1 bedroom 1 bath can run you from $800-$1100., 18425=Community College is a great choice for students who don't have too much money to spend for college! For a full time student tuition is only $1000 per semester. On top of that if you have Bright Futures or other scholarship money you pay even less. I only paid around $600 for tuition this semester! You also save money on room and board which costs around $8000. There are no additional daily expenses for students living at home.

For those who do not have this scholarship, community college tuition is still far less than tuition at a public university and after earning your associate's degree, the credits should transfer to other post secondary institutions, which saves you money in the long run. Am enjoying being here While this school is a sort of stepping stone on my way to a university, and I do look forward to transferring to a post-secondary institution with a bit more prestige, I cannot help but enjoy my time here.
