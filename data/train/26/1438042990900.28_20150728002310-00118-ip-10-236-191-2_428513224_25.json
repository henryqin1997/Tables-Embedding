            "METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR DIGESTING TISSUE - Embodiments of this disclosure relate to tissue digestion and, more particularly, to methods and apparatuses for varying the number, size, and/or location of one or more tissue compartments within a digestive fluid vessel. Some examples include partitions that may be selectively positioned within a vessel (and may be selectively removable from the vessel) to create one or more tissue compartments. The partitions may be positioned, repositioned and rearranged within the vessel to form one or more tissue compartments. The partitions may be solid or include apertures, and may be oriented in horizontally and/or vertically. Alternate embodiments include one or more selectively closeable apertures that permit digestive fluid to circulate along alternate pathways, which can permit tissue digestion with reduced digestive fluid levels. Still further embodiments include baskets that are selectively positionable within the tissue digester. The baskets may also include one or more selectively positionable and/or repositionable partitions.",
            "TISSUE DIGESTION METHOD AND APPARATUS - Tissue digestion methods and apparatuses that provide easy, safe and inexpensive disposal of biological tissue, for example animal carcasses and human cadavers, are disclosed. Embodiments include tissue digesters with elongated cylindrical vessels for holding digestive fluid and baskets for holding tissue within said vessel. Embodiments include baskets with perforations to allow circulation of digestive fluid around and about the tissue. In one form the basket holding the tissue is horizontally loaded into a horizontally disposed vessel. The vessel is then tilted to a more vertical orientation. Gravity helps to collect the tissue fragments in a sloped collection region of the basket, which is located near a mixer to allow continual agitation of the tissue fragments as they are digested. The tissue digester can operate efficiently at lower temperature and pressures, is mechanically less complicated, consumes less power and is less expensive to manufacture than conventional tissue digesting systems. At higher temperatures employed in a pressure vessel provided by this invention, the tilting mechanism also dramatically improves the efficiency of the process and the completeness of the tissue digestion."

Wilson, Danville, IN US 12-23-2010 METHOD AND COMPOSITION FOR TREATING PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE - The invention relates to methods and compositions for treating and preventing pulmonary hemorrhage in an animal, and for reducing red blood cells in the airways of an animal. More particularly, the invention relates to methods and compositions for treating and preventing pulmonary hemorrhage in an animal, and for reducing red blood cells in the airways of an animal wherein a feed composition comprising an about 3:1 to an about 1:3 ratio of docosahexaneoic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid is fed to the animal. 20100323028 Published Description Patent application number Lindsey Wilson, Jamestown, IN US //]]> BarDraw('3316129',['Patent applications by Kerry Wilson, Elkhart, IN US'],[[5,2,1]],['2009','2012','2013'],0); // <script type=\"text/javascript\"> </div> <div id=\"legend3316129\" align=\"center\"></div> </div> <canvas id=\"bg3316129\" style=\"max-width: 500px; width: 100%;\"></canvas> <div> <p align=\"center\">Patent applications by Kerry Wilson, Elkhart, IN US</p> <div class=\"bar3316129\" style=\"max-width: 500px; width: 100%; float:left; \"> <div align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top:20px;\"> </table> </tbody> </tr> <td>02-14-2013</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20130037564\">AUTOMATED PIPETTING APPARATUS HAVING A COMBINED LIQUID PUMP AND PIPETTE HEAD SYSTEM</a> - The technology described herein generally relates to systems for extracting polynucleotides from multiple samples, particularly from biological samples, and additionally to systems that subsequently amplify and detect the extracted polynucleotides.

A display shows the base price of the product without optional items, and a with-options price. Icons representing optional items may be moved between unselected and selected areas. As the icons are moved into or out of the selected area, the with-options price is instantaneously updated, including any price changes resulting from the application of pricing components reflecting the costs of financing or leasing. 12-20-2012 Michael T. Wilson, Noblesville, IN US Patent application number Description Published 20140316931 F& I MENU SYSTEM - An F&I menu system for the sale of vehicles, or other products which are often financed and which includes multiple options. A display shows the price of the vehicle with and without the options, and as icons representing the optional items are selected and deselected, the with-options price is automatically updated. The display may include an area showing a predetermined set of options and an associated price, and individual icons may be dragged and dropped into a separate selection area whose display is suppressed until an icon is moved into the selection area. Once a sale is completed, the backend system may generate customized electronic follow up communications to customers concerning certain options the customer",
