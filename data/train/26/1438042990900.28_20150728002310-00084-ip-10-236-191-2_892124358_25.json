In fact, I might have rated this a two, had I been able to tell you more about it because they totally revamped it last semester and it is effective Fall 2012. Basically, it's changed from a gift card that buys all of your meals until you run out to an overpriced all you can eat ordeal that does not limit how much you eat or what you eat. The downfall to this is that you're forced to pay for your meal plan, and eating off campus won't get you your money back because it's paid for at the beginning of the semester. As for the food, it's also changing, but last semester it got old really fast. Most people ate at Grill works (basically a cheap fast food place) 3 times a day, 7 days a week. Yeah, gross., 247234=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 198603=We have sororities and fraternities on campus, but no Greek houses on campus. Sigma Beta Chi has a house that the boys rent out every semester, but that's about it. At times, it's easy to tell who is in Greek life and who is not. We have Greek Week in October and the fraternities and sororities have fundraisers during the week and during quad on Fridays.}",

Tips for prospective students At St. Mary's University you not only gain a great college experience but you gain a great education as well. For prospective students you should really have your mind set on school before anything else and it will be hard so try to gain study skills while in high school. Bang for the buck Any college is going to cost money and St. Mary's isn't cheap so apply for a lot of scholarships and grants because if you get loans its not fun to have to pay them back. Am enjoying being here I love being at St. Mary's because it is a small campus which is great because you gain one on one time with you professors instead of making appointments like you would at a huge campus. Am learning a lot I am currently a student at St. Mary's and have learned a lot while being here. I am a biology major and have gained a lot of knowledge in biology. I've",
