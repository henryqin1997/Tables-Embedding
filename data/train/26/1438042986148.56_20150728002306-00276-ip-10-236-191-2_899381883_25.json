Majority of the students at Livingstone are friendly and the upperclassman try to give insight on the school to better prepare you for your years to come. Students should finish college on time because the staff members are eager to help you get ahead."

They are very pleasant, professional and guided me step by step on the enrollment process to make my admission a smooth transition. If you are entering Livingstone in the Fall of 2014, I do recommend that you attend the first orientation session in June. This will give you the opportunity to get all of your paperwork in on time, see the campus, and get all of your financial and housing needs addressed before the masses arrive in August. Most people wait until the last session and it can be very chaotic because you are competing with hundreds of other students., 3678=Tuition is about $22050.00 but books are included and the food isn't that bad either., 105837=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 9573=Well we only pay 22500 for the academic year which is high in price but not so bad for a private institution.}",

Tips for prospective students College is what you make it and Livingstone is no different. You have to come in with a positive attitude and know that everything you do will help you in the long run. Bang for the buck Tuition is about $22050.00 but books are included and the food isn't that bad either. Am enjoying being here I love being on campus; but there is not that much to do out in the town. the campus is small so the class room sizes are pretty good at < 20 to 1.",
