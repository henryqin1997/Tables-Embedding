These are projections based on running a computer simulation hundreds of thousands of times with projection data that is inherently limited. If your favorite team doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t project well, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame me, blame the computers and spreadsheets that projected them. I guess you can blame me for the CAIRO results if you want, otherwise you can take heart in the 2006 Tigers projecting to win 80, the 2010 Giants projecting to go 81-81 or the 2012 Orioles projecting to win 70 games.\u00a0 These are not meant to tell you how the season is going to play out.\u00a0 I prefer to think of them more as a starting point for discussion, with a range of something like 10 wins in either direction based on how things actually end up playing out.\u00a0 You can look at them and argue about why you think some teams will be better or worse., 391959=Because Marcel regresses more heavily than other projections and because it assumes every one who hasn\u2019t played in MLB projects as league average, you see a tighter spread here than you\u2019ll see in other projected standings.\u00a0 The standard deviation for team wins in my last CAIRO projections was about 9.\u00a0 In this version it\u2019s 7.1.\u00a0 That may be more realistic if you think about how little we really know about how good/bad players and teams are, even though what will actually happen in 2012 will show a much bigger spread more in line with other projected standings., 568715=W: Projected 2011 wins L: Projected 2011 losses RS: Projected 2011 runs scored RA: Projected 2011 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC: Wild card win percentage PL: Playoff percentage (Div + WC) W+/-: 2011 projected wins minus 2010 actual wins RS+/-: 2011 projected runs scored minus 2010 actual runs scored (positive means they are projected to score more) RA+/-: 2011 projected runs allowed minus 2010 actual runs allowed (negative means they are projected to allow fewer), 535534=So, anyway, using the depth charts from the wonderful MLB Depth Charts and includng playing time from players on the 40 man roster who don\u2019t necessarily figure to be part of the the opening day 25 man rosters to account for organizational depth and playing out next season 10,000 times, here\u2019s how CAIRO v0.3 sees things as of December 27, 2010., 405632=1) There are still a lot of roster changes coming.\u00a0 This may give us some sense of how the offseason has impacted teams to this point and it also shows us how things might look if nothing changed from now until April.\u00a0 Which won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen., 405073=I\u2019m releasing CAIRO 2012 v 0.3 today which mainly fixes a problem with a handful of pitchers like Alexi Ogando and Ross Ohlendorf and moves players to new teams where applicable.\u00a0 I figure it\u2019d be a good time to run some projected standings even though they are too early to be of any real value., 526896=Friday, April 8 Phil \u201c88 mph\u201d Hughes vs. John \u201cWorld Series Hero\u201d Lackey, 464157=W: Projected final 2011 wins L: Projected final 2011 losses RS: Projected final 2011 runs scored RA: Projected final 2011 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC: Wild card win percentage PL: Playoff percentage (Div + WC), 570908=The Orioles tend to project better than they actually end up doing every year, but perhaps they\u2019ll Buck that trend in 2011., 89452=And there you have it.\u00a0 The 2013 projection blowout.\u00a0 Results are not guaranteed., 203866=Sabathia will make his first start since June 24 on Tuesday night against Toronto. Out with a groin strain, he says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feeling well enough to pitch as long as he needs to and thinks the time off might have been more beneficial to his left arm than the groin. ... Gardner was sore a day after he had four at-bats in a three-inning simulated game and was being kept off the field Monday. The speedy outfielder has already had two setbacks in his recovery from a strained elbow that has sidelined him since April 18., 146985=Using these offensive numbers with the revised pitching projections for the scheduled starters(for six innings) and the average 2012 relief ERA for each team for three innings for the six remaining games gives us this., 533104=Things appear to be getting pretty tight.\u00a0 This is going to make Boston beating out the 1927 Yankees as \u201cbest team of evah\u201d particularly noteworthy., 306798=I\u2019ve uploaded the final pre-season 2012 CAIRO projections and projected standings.\u00a0 They can be downloaded here., 30366=W: Projected final 2014 wins L: Projected final 2014 losses RS: Projected final 2014 runs scored RA: Projected final 2014 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: Projected wins within one standard deviation, 9237=MLB Trade Rumors: Yankees Pursuing Craig Kimbrel; Astros Interested As Well (145 Comments - 7/31/2015 7:18:11 pm), 186549=Congratulations to the Tampa Bay Rays on their 2012 AL East title., 131004=I think this confirms that getting to the target of a $189M payroll in 2014 may be the Yankees #1 focus right now, and that\u2019s going to make it a bit harder to build a super team for 2013.\u00a0 Of course, you don\u2019t need a super team to win a World Series, but it helps., 201245=Friday, July 27, 7:05 PM ET Aaron Cook vs. Phil Hughes, 405481=DISCLAIMER: This is very limited in telling us much about how 2012 will play out for a large number of reasons., 9661=Yankees (57-43) @ Rangers (48-52) , Thursday July 30, 2015 , 8:05 PM (155 Comments - 7/31/2015 9:25:01 am), 505434=W: Projected 2011 wins L: Projected 2011 losses RS: Projected 2011 runs scored RA: Projected 2011 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC: Wild card win percentage PL: Playoff percentage (Div + WC), 298431=W: Projected final 2011 wins L: Projected final 2011 losses RS: Projected final 2011 runs scored RA: Projected final 2011 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: 2012 revised projected wins minus 2012 pre-season projected wins RS+/-: 2012 revised projected runs scored minus 2012 pre-season projected runs scored (positive means they are projected to score more) RA+/-: 2012 revised projected runs allowed minus 2012 pre-season projected runs allowed (negative means they are projected to allow fewer), 405928=2) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to construct meaningful rosters for a lot of teams, so these projections will favor the teams that have essentially completed their 2012 rosters., 268631=We\u2019re roughly about 10% of the way throught the 2012 regular season, which is a pretty small sample size to make sweeping observations about how good or bad teams are.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that what\u2019s happened to this point isn\u2019t important, because it is.\u00a0 I wanted to see what teams have seen the biggest shifts in their outlooks based on how they projected coming into the year compared what they have done since., 90961=But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include technically unsigned players like Phil Hughes, Boone Logan, Joba Chamberlain, Ivan Nova and Clay Rapada, who are under the Yankees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 control but are either arbitration eligible or will have their contracts renewed for 2013. Once the Yankees come to agreements with those players, the payroll will rise, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect their seemingly ironclad plan to be under $189 million for 2014, the year that significant luxury tax incentives kick in., 527248=Sunday, April 10 CC \u201cFuture Red Sock\u201d Sabathia vs. Josh \u201cGuardian of playing the game right\u201d Beckett, 64916=With all the disclaimers out of the way, on to the projected standings.\u00a0 These are the combined results for all five projection systems.\u00a0 The standings are rounded to the nearest win so if the total W-L doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up to 2430-2430 that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why., 338221=I\u2019ve uploaded the latest version of the 2012 MLB CAIRO projections. They can be downloaded here., 86419=There\u2019s a new floormat in the AL West, and it\u2019s the Houston Astros.\u00a0 Can they lose 100+ games for the third year in a row?\u00a0 The projections think they can.\u00a0 Houston projects to be so bad that they have essentially balanced out the league difference between the AL and NL.\u00a0 Last year, the AL went 1150-1118 thanks to interleague play.\u00a0 If you add Houston\u2019s 55-107 to that you get a record of 1205-1225.\u00a0 Los Anaheim looks like the favorite here and project to win more games than any other team in baseball, with Texas a strong second.\u00a0 The Angels do have some concerns in their rotation, which could open the door for the Rangers.\u00a0 Oakland projects to fall back a bit from last year, but still should be in contention.\u00a0 Seattle still doesn\u2019t look particularly good, although they should score some more runs this year, which is something., 269178=1) Get 2012 projections.\u00a0 In this case I\u2019m using the average of the 2012 MLB projection blowout that I ran at the beginning of April. 2) Estimate revised team strength.\u00a0 For now, this is just a basic weighted average of the team\u2019s projections heading into the year and their Pythagenpat performance to this point.\u00a0 I\u2019m not making any adjustments for injuries/roster changes/etc., yet,\u00a0 although as we get deeper into the season I\u2019ll probably do that. 3) Run the rest of the 2012 MLB season through my Monte Carlo simulator and see what happens.\u00a0 This includes a variable that alters team strength in each iteration to account for things that projections can\u2019t account for., 10828=NY Times: Yankees and Cashman Remain Quiet as Trade Deadline Nears (42 Comments - 7/30/2015 4:42:30 pm), 158466=W: Projected final 2012 wins L: Projected final 2012 losses Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2), 94503=I don\u2019t expect Dickey to repeat his 2012, but CAIRO still likes him a lot in 2013.\u00a0 As a Jay he projects to put up an ERA of around 3.65 over 211 innings which would be worth somewhere in the area of 4.5 - 5 wins.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how the AL East now projects adding Dickey to the Jays, Stephen Drew to the Red Sox and a few other tweaks to the other teams\u2019 depth charts., 187410=We\u2019re down to a mere 12 remaining games against Boston this year, with three of those slated for this weekend in the first road series at DNYS for Boston.\u00a0 How we\u2019ve gotten to four days from August with Boston making their first trip to the Bronx I don\u2019t really understand, but here we are.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll pick this up from the the last time I ran these., 406657=Anyway, using the depth charts from the wonderful MLB Depth Charts and includng playing time from players on the 40 man roster who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily figure to be part of the the opening day 25 man rosters to account for organizational depth and playing out next season 100,000 times, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how CAIRO v0.3 sees things as of December 13, 2011.\u00a0 These were run with Aramis Ramirez as a Brewer, but I didn\u2019t remove any of the non-tendered players from yesterday from their rosters., 534254=Around this time every year I like to run projected standings for the upcoming MLB season.\u00a0 It\u2019s very limited in telling us much about how 2011 will play out since there are still a lot of roster changes coming, but it may give us some sense of how the offseason has impacted teams to this point and it also shows us how things would look if nothing changed from now until April.\u00a0 Which won\u2019t happen., 10397=MLB Trade Rumors: Yankees To Place Michael Pineda On DL With Forearm Injury (40 Comments - 7/30/2015 7:58:38 pm), 105434=Since I was curious about how the big trade between Kansas City and Tampa Bay affected the AL East, I ran some projected standings based on rosters as of last night.\u00a0 As the title says, this is extremely early and completely useless so think of it more as a goof than anything too serious.\u00a0 So using CAIRO v0.2 and the depth charts from MLB Depth Charts and Rotochamp as a rough gauge of playing time, here\u2019s how the 2013 MLB season looks as of December 10., 57621=2005 2006 2007 2008 Pt 1 2008 Pt 2 2009 AL 2009 NL 2010 AL 2010 NL 2011 AL 2011 NL 2012, 59791=2) Playing time distribution in these simulations will not match actual 2013 playing time. I used the rosters and depth charts available at MLB Depth Charts plus whatever I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read over the offseason as my guide to set these up as realistically as possible, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possible source of error. Rosters were set up to have 35-40 or so active players per team, and to get a reasonable amount of playing time from the bench and extra pitchers, to more closely model reality. Basically, no players are set to play more than 90% of the time, starting catchers are restricted to at most about 75% of the games, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made sure teams get a non-trivial amount of starts from their 6-8 starters. The healthier a team is in 2013, the more likely they will be to exceed these projections, and vice versa., 97382=The teams are still pretty tightly bunched, but Toronto\u2019s got a bit of a separation from the pack now.\u00a0 Anyway, projected standings in December don\u2019t really tell us all that much so please Orioles fans don\u2019t kill me., 201342=Saturday, July 28, 4:05 PM ET Jon Lester vs. CC Sabathia, 57243=With Opening Day rapidly approaching, it\u2019s time for my 2013 MLB projected standings blowout.\u00a0 The idea behind this series of posts is to try and project how the 2013 MLB season might look given what we think we may know right now.\u00a0 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing a version of this since 2005, and you can see the results by looking at the following links., 81263=W: Projected final 2013 wins L: Projected final 2013 losses RS: Projected final 2013 runs scored RA: Projected final 2013 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: Projected wins within one standard deviation, 151055=The Yankees\u2019 second half slide really began when they got swept in Oakland in a four game series following a home sweep of Toronto.\u00a0 Prior to that series, the Yankees had a 10 game lead in the division and were 57-34.\u00a0 Since the opener of that series on July 19 they\u2019ve gone 29-29 and lost nine games off their division lead., 201441=Sunday, July 29, 8:05 PM ET Felix Doubront vs. Hiroki Kuroda, 91473=If the Yankees are over the $189 million mark for 2014, their luxury tax rate would soar to 50 percent (they are currently at 40 percent). If they are below it, the rate would plummet to 17.5 percent, and that could translate into potential savings of $50 million. Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 managing general partner, has clearly stated his desire to be under the mark, which is why the Yankees have, for the most part, made only tepid advances in the free-agent market in the past two seasons., 7742=Yankees (58-45) @ White Sox (50-52) , Sunday August 2, 2015 , 2:10 PM (37 Comments - 8/3/2015 1:57:12 am), 7315=NY Times: A Resurgent Didi Gregorius Helps the Yankees Pound the White Sox (43 Comments - 8/4/2015 1:56:18 am), 56050=W: Projected final 2013 wins L: Projected final 2013 losses RS: Projected final 2013 runs scored RA: Projected final 2013 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2), 534712=Since this point is not readily comprehensible for people of limited intelligence I\u2019ll reiterate it. It\u2019s too early to construct meaningful rosters for a lot of teams, so these projections will favor the teams that have essentially completed their 2011 rosters.\u00a0, 90528=As of Dec. 31, 2012, the Yankees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 payroll was right at the targeted threshold of $189 million, give or take a few hundred thousand. According to Cot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Baseball Contracts at BaseballProspectus.com, the Yankees have contractual commitments to 14 players worth $189,475,000. That includes Kevin Youkilis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new one-year, $12 million contract and the $8.5 million they still owe A.J. Burnett., 16632=As the title says, this is extremely early and completely useless so think of it more as a goof than anything too serious.\u00a0 So using CAIRO v0.2 which I\u2019ll probably post tomorrow and the depth charts from MLB Depth Charts and Rotochamp as a rough gauge of playing time, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the 2014 MLB season looks as of November 20., 569369=The only reason I am showing wins and losses to one decimal place is so I don\u2019t have to answer questions about why the wins and losses don\u2019t add up to exactly 2430.\u00a0 There is no way to imply that something like this can be precise to that level., 10050=MLB Trade Rumors: Yankees Acquire Dustin Ackley (30 Comments - 7/30/2015 8:17:07 pm), 31275=But if you are a Yankee fan, like I used to be, this is pretty disheartening.\u00a0 It\u2019s not surprising, and if you put the lineup and pitching staff together based on how they project in 2014 you will see they are about as far from championship caliber as any team in the American League.\u00a0 Maybe moreso considering the relative strength of their division.\u00a0, 238941=W: Projected final 2012 wins L: Projected final 2012 losses RS: Projected final 2012 runs scored RA: Projected final 2012 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: 2012 revised projected wins minus 2012 pre-season projected wins RS+/-: 2012 revised projected runs scored minus 2012 pre-season projected runs scored (positive means they are projected to score more) RA+/-: 2012 revised projected runs allowed minus 2012 pre-season projected runs allowed (negative means they are projected to allow fewer), 8850=Yankees (57-44) @ White Sox (49-51) , Friday July 31, 2015 , 8:10 PM (56 Comments - 8/1/2015 2:03:16 am), 126318=As a goof I ran 100 iterations of the 2013 MLB schedule to get some projected standings but won\u2019t post the whole thing.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how the AL East looks as of last night.}",
