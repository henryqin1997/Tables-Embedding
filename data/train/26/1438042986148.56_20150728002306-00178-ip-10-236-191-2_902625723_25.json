            "I have never felt more safe walking around in the middle of the night. The most dangerous and illegal thing a person in or around New Paltz is likely to do to you is offer a puff of their joint to you, and then say OK, cool when you decline. The crime rate is relatively low, and almost everyone out at night is off on a fun adventure, so you'll never encounter a creeper or anyone who'll do you harm. It's a happy campus and happening little town.",
            "There are some sororities and fraternities around campus, but they are not a huge presence on campus. They're there and active for those who want that kind of experience, but there's no need to join a frat or sorority to have a social life.",
            "There's clubs for everything under the sun here, and if there isn't a club already existing for what you want to do, it's easy to start one of your own. Some of my favorites include Dumbledore's Army, Humans vs Zombies, Live Action Role Play, Swing Club, New Paltz Players, Epic Glee, Miami Theatre Players, Ninja Alliance and Writer's Block, to name a few. There are also plenty of human and civil rights themed clubs, like our Dream Team and the Queer Action Coalition. There's also the Parkour Club and Capture the Flag, as well as many other club sports for those who wish to keep physically active",
            "This school is great for moderately self-motivated people who think having a good time is more than just drinking. It's the perfect school for artsy, techie or nerdy kids who didn't fit in to the typical in-crowd in high school, and really anyone else. It's socially accepting of all kinds of people, however, and all that's required of students who don't follow comic books, games or the latest art and theatre trends is to give it all a shot, because who knows, you may like it!",
            "Because New Paltz is a SUNY, it's relatively inexpensive, as schools go. But just because it's relatively cheap doesn't mean you lose out on something a more expensive school has to offer! New Paltz offers programs and services that you'd otherwise have to take out a second mortgage for, like research programs that pump out the leading scholars and scientists of tomorrow, and a Theatre program whose recent graduates include several network tech executives and one Tony Award winning lighting design assistant. For 16-20 thousand a year, that's pretty impressive!",
            "There's plenty of fun places to go and things to do around campus. When you're not fighting people with NERF guns or swing dancing, you can hike on Mohonk Mountain or walk the Rail Trail, or even just go exploring in the woods south of the main campus buildings. There's also a dance club and plenty of parties for those interested, and dances on campus for those who prefer less drink in their dance. And no matter what, someone's always going on an adventure and looking for a friend to join them, and someone's always hosting a movie night they'd love for you to come to, so you're never lacking in social opportunities.",
            "There's plenty of delicious food, on and off campus. Hasbrouck, the main dining hall and the all-you-can-eat buffet, is a fantastic place to meet people over food, and when you're ready for something new, Hawk Street Station downstairs serves delicious, made-to-order pasta and paninis in the evenings, as does Backstage Cafe in the afternoons. There are dozens of fantastic cafes and coffee shops on and off campus, and plenty of inexpensive restaurants within 5-10 minutes walking distance of campus. Personally, I highly recommend the Bakery -- they make the most delicious Reuben I've ever tasted, and they're easy on the wallet too!",
            "Your dorm experience here is completely determined by where you are. There are plenty of programs for residents in each dorm (like macaroni art, condom casinos and Super Bowl parties), but some are more populated than others; likewise, there's more of a sense of community in some dorms than others. If you're looking for it, however, you will find strong dorm spirit wherever you land. I didn't get too far into that myself, but I know very happy and very lovely people who did, so you'd be in good company!",
            "New Paltz hits a nice balance in academics. Nobody will ever have you taking a harder class than you're willing to take, but there are plenty of more challenging classes for those who wish to take them. Your workload is completely determined by your own interests in that way. This does mean that, in order to get the most out of college here, you need to be self-motivated, but one would think a little self motivation would be necessary at any college, so in the long run it's nothing to worry about. What's most important to me at least is that New Paltz offers the freedom to let your motivation take you in any of a number of academic and extracurricular directions.",
            "Don't be nervous! Nobody here will EVER judge you! And don't worry about your grades. If you're applying, all your grades do is get you past the first round. Not everyone who's here came in with an impressive transcript, but they did all have passion for something, whether they were studying it or not, and that shone through in their essay and extracurricular resume. That's what the Admissions people here are looking for -- passion.",
            "I love everything New Paltz has to offer. You have a wealth of academic and research opportunities, a rich cultural and social scene, and plenty of fantastic food all around. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an artsy or geek-friendly campus, and anyone looking for a good, rewarding time in college."

There are great tours, and if you apply and get accepted there is an accepted students tour in April (which I attended last year and where I fell in love with the school)., 9679=I am enjoying New Paltz, for the most part. However, being a transfer student is a very unpleasant experience. First of all, there is no on campus housing if you transfer from another school. You have to find your own apartment or commute from home if you live close enough. Second, making my schedule at orientation was a nightmare. The majority of the classes had filled and there was no one on one advising. It was hard to know exactly what you needed to take, and even if you did know, the class probably was full. They were able to put me in some full classes, but they will not do that for certain courses, such as Psychology courses. Also, parking for commuters is much further than parking for residents and faculty/staff. The people here are very friendly, and there is a 2:1 ratio of residents to commuters, so fitting in is not extremely hard.

I know way too many people who just signed up to attend a school for 4 years without knowing what they were signing up for. these are often the people who end up needing to transfer or don't get what they want or need out of their college experience. This is your life. Be as involved in the process as you can afford to be. And something more specific to New Paltz is APPLY EARLY TO AVOID BEING TRIPLED. I applied in October for Early Action, which is non binding. This guaranteed that I would only have to share a room with one other person, as opposed to being tripled, which is when they have 3 people living in a room intended for 2 people (Theres 3 beds though! and it costs less money)}",
