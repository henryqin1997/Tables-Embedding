(48 printed pages), 4014=For more information about Analysis Services and performance tuning, see the Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Resource Kit., 5412=The Analysis server is the server component of Microsoft\u00ae SQL Server\u2122 2000 Analysis Services. It is designed specifically to create and maintain multidimensional data structures and to provide multidimensional data in response to client queries. This release introduces data mining, which integrates significant data analysis and prediction capabilities into Analysis Services. The service that is associated with Analysis server is the MSSQLServerOLAPService service.}",

You can use Analysis Manager to modify this entry. In Analysis Manager, you can modify this entry in the Properties dialog box. Right-click the server, choose Properties, and then click the Active Directory tab. Remarks 0x00000000 (0) Default Value 0x00000001 (1) Maximum Value 0x00000000 (0) Minimum Value The ActiveDirectoryEnabled entry indicates whether the server has registered itself in Microsoft Active Directory\u2122. ActiveDirectoryEnabled Several entries make references to pagefile size. The pagefile is a file that the operating system manages to improve performance by swapping rarely-used pages of memory to the disk. You can determine the pagefile size by right-clicking My Computer and selecting Properties. On the Advanced tab, click Performance Options. The size is indicated under Virtual Memory. Several entries are bit mask entries. The value to which an entry has been set can be determined by performing a logical OR operation with the chosen values. For example, if you choose the values 1, 2, and 4, the value that is entered into the entry is 7. Conversely, determining the values to which a bit mask entry has been set can be done with a logical AND operation. The \"Default Value\" section for each entry indicates the default value for the entry on a new installation. Unless stated otherwise, this is also the value used by the",
