Allowable Daily Noise Exposure Limits-Unprotected Applying vibration-damping materials to all resonating surfaces, and constructing (where possible) sound absorbent hoods around points of operation. Isolating noisy equipment with rubber footings, springs, or other forms of damping suspension so as to reduce the radiation and amplification of noise via vibrations. Ensuring that equipment frames are as rigid as possible, that equipment is firmly seated on a solid floor (preferably cement slab), and that no piece of equipment is in contact with any other piece or with walls. Moving power equipment operations out of wooden or steel-frame buildings and into stone, cement, or brick structures, if at all possible. Reducing the speed of operation of the equipment to the slowest level consistent with product quantity and quality goals. Maintaining motors and all moving parts in top operating condition. Maintenance involves lubricating and cleaning; replacing worn parts; maintaining proper belt tensions and bolt torques; and properly balancing pulleys, blades, and other rotating parts. Examples of source control steps include the following: What Are the Health Hazards of Noise? Excessive noise can damage a person's ability to hear-an effect that can be temporary or permanent. There also is mounting evidence that noise may adversely affect other parts of the body-",
    "textAfterTable": "Path Controls Effective path controls involve isolating, blocking, diverting, absorbing, or otherwise reducing noise intensity before it reaches your employees' ears. Examples of path control steps include Segregating operations so as to limit, as far as possible, the number of employees exposed to excessive equipment noise. Enclosing equipment within barriers designed to absorb noise and/or reflect it in harmless directions, such as toward ceilings covered with sound absorbent material. Moving or locating noise-producing equipment away from employees, since noise intensity decreases significantly as you move away from the source of the noise. Depending on the types of surfaces in your workplace, you can reduce the level of noise that your workers are exposed to by up to 6 dBA by doubling the distance between the source of the noise and your workers. The presence of reflective surfaces (such as flat metal surfaces) in the workplace will reduce the level of noise reduction achieved by this method. Hearing Protection Hearing protection devices isolate the human ear from harmful noises. They should be worn by your employees as the final line of defense against noise hazards. Hearing protection devices can be effective and, compared to source and path control efforts, relatively inexpensive. Their use, however, does demand a considerable level of ongoing",
