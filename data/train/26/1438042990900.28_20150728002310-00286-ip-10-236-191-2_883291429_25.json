            "There are Crystal Lake police officers stationed on campus the whole time the school is open. The officers on duty are always more than willing to accompany students to their cars in the parking lots at night if need be, and there are call boxes located in the parking lots as well in case of any emergencies or unnerving situations.",
            "The school is great for anyone. The have different facilities to aid all types of students, and the school makes everyone feel like they belong. It doesn't matter how old or young you are, or if you have a disability, you can attend this school.",

            "I don't know what the food tastes like, but I see many of the students around campus eating it regularly, and it smells fantastic every time I walk through the commons/ cafeteria.",
            "There is no dorm, it's a commuter school, but as near as I can figure, it's not too far for people to commute from the surrounding communities. Some of my classes have people coming from Marengo, IL.",
            "I definitely find some of my classes challenging, but I kind of like that because it'll prepare me for a university beyond MCC. Some of the professors are strict, some are lots of fun to be in the classroom with.",
            "Don't worry about much. The school is very affordable, and a great place for a freshman in college to start. There are many programs available at the school to help you get acquainted with life at the school. Class schedules are flexible, and the academic advisers there are fantastic about getting you the best schedule possible.",
            "MCC is a really great school with fantastic programs. The schedules are flexible, and you can plan your schooling around jobs or any other conflicts in your life. It's also a very diverse school, with many different clubs and groups to make everyone feel welcome."

There are tons of vending machines around campus which have a lot of variety of snacks and drinks!

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Students that like to know their classmates would love it here. It's a close atmosphere. Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid! All the other students went through the same things. Also, don't ditch school just because you can. Keeping up with school is easier if you attend. Bang for the buck It's cheaper than any University, but it still has the same activities a University offers. There are many clubs and sports that MCC offers to its students. Am enjoying being here I have met so many new people! The students are friendly and helpful. My English teacher made me feel welcome the moment I walked in. Am learning a lot I have learned so much! My teachers have found ways to interact with their students in a positive way. Login to rate or flag the reviews Weston from Cary, IL 05/09/2011 Reviewer is A past student here. 3 of",
