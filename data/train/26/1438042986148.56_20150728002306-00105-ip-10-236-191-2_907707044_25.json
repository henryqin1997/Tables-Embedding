On my first lab seven girls lost items from their tool kits first day and during my 9th lab I forgot my binder one night and it was never found. I lost my expensive livescribe pen and all my notes including one my very expensive text books. I never got them back and was out a little over $1000 in items., 194082=Apply here if you want to go into Culinary arts (also Baking and Pastry) or Hospitality, any other major here is a waste of time. If you are going to Baking apply really early like September., 255742=Campus safety is a priority for Johnson and Wales and taken very seriously. The school being located directly in the city places emphases on the campus safety crew. Also placed around both the culinary and business campuses there are emergency buttons. These buttons light up neon blue during the night time, and have a speaker phone which activates when pressed to speak to an emergency representative. Another campus safety plus is that there is a JWU safety ride available week days and weekends. These rides are very helpfully when a student are stranded or need medical assistance, and the rides run all day to 4:00 am in the morning, 300264=Because we do not have a football team, we are passionate about our basketball team. Every year during October we celebrate something called Midnight Madness. This is where all the JWU sports teams can come out and show us what they are all about, with a central focus on the basketball team. We have dance competitions and wild prizes. It's sure to be a good time., 156466=This school is really beautiful. I visited the school twice and I can not wait to go there in september. I will surely enjoy attending here., 546096=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 112498=i went to visit this school in november 2011 and i really enjoyed the school and all the people that were there. they were very helpful in answering questions that i had., 362707=classes are 1:55 minutes 2 times a week and we never have class on fridays unless u choose to., 23200=enjoy it while it last, and APPLY TO BE A RESIDENTIAL ASSISTANT. i couldn't tell anyone enough, also a big prepare tool that most people don't realize till its to late, WORRY ABOUT YOUR LOANS BEFORE THE LAST FEW MONTHS meaning if you start school in Sept. start to work on your loans in June, 439624=Johnson & Wales is a good school for everyone no matter what major you choose. Since I started attending here in 2012 I have grown to it, the schools makes you feel welcomed and accepted. The campus is also near everything so its great., 390520=It honestly is a hit or miss situation. People will steal things here, come into your room when you are sleeping at like 2:00 am, and will not care whether they are bothering you or not. The dorms are pretty small as well, and can get kind of dirty., 33912=go to the providence place mall, there is a ton of shopping there! there's also waterfire, which is fun to see in september with your new friends! also, i love going to thayer st. near brown university to go out to eat!}",

Tips for prospective students - Get to know your professors and chefs! - Don't be shy. Meet new people. Don't hang out in the dorm all day. - Get involved. - Don't slack off. - Make sure culinary is really what you want to do. It's hard and it's frustrating for those who don't have a passion for culinary or baking & pastry. - Be prepared to work really hard in your 6 hour lab. - Know how to iron before you get",
