No color achieves the target range of DeltaE smaller than 5. Yellow comes closest to the target range; the screen has a bluish cast., 73014=The screen offers very satisfactory, almost good rates with a contrast of 559:1 and black value of 0.37 cd/m\u00b2. These rates are very appropriate for a laptop from this price range. Lenovo's G505s (582:1; 0.34 cd/m\u00b2) is virtually on a par. The Aspire (344:1; 0.54 cd/m\u00b2) is clearly behind its contenders. The Pavilion's screen cannot reproduce the sRGB or AdobeRGB color spaces. It covers the sRGB color space by almost 51%. Color spaces are important for professional image editing, for example.}",

We performed the test with the latter using an Ethernet connection due to a defect. Websites are opened every 40 seconds, the energy-saving profile is enabled and the screen's brightness is set to approximately 150 cd/m\u00b2 for the Wi-Fi test. The Pavilion stopped DVD playback\u00a0after 3:47 h, which is again longer than both the G505s (2:51 h) and the Aspire (2.48 h). The DVD test is performed using enabled energy-savings mode (or a higher profile should the DVD not run smoothly), maximum screen brightness and disabled wireless modules., 217212=The Pavilion achieved an idle runtime of 10:04 h. The Aspire (6:22 h) and G505s (5:56 h) lag far behind that. We use Battery Eater's Reader's test to ascertain the idle runtime. The screen is set to minimum brightness, energy-savings mode is enabled and the wireless modules are disabled. The Pavilion lasted for 1:38 h during load and is on a par with the Aspire (1:31 h); the G505s is drained sooner (0.47 h). The load runtime is ascertained via Battery Eater's Classic test using maximum screen brightness, the high-performance profile and enabled wireless modules., 185371=The CPU ran the stress test (Prime95 and Furmark run for at least one hour) with approximately 1.4 GHz in AC mode. The cores were occasionally throttled to 1.2 to 1.3 GHz. The GPU performed the stress test with 950 to 1000 MHz, but it was throttled to 600 MHz in battery mode. The CPU thus has a higher cooling capacity available and can consequently perform the stress test with 2.1 to 2.2 GHz in battery mode., 283700=$59.99 AC Power Adapter Charger 45W for HP Pavilion 15-n Series 15-n005sg New Genuine [], 104758=The HD Graphics 4400 GPU takes care of graphical output. The graphics core supports DirectX 11.1 and clocks with speeds ranging from 200 MHz to 1000 MHz.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Gaming Performance Playing on the Pavilion is still possible at a low level. Users who are satisfied with a low resolution and quality level can certainly coax smooth gameplay out of the laptop. Higher frame rates would be possible by installing a second working memory module. The memory would then run in dual-channel mode, the GPU would work more efficiently and - depending on the game - achieve up to 20% higher frame rates. We tried this on the Pavilion: We ascertained a frame rate increase in both Tomb Raider (46.3/23.4/14.9) and BioShock Infinite (32.1/17.8/15.6). Should the Pavilion's gaming performance not fulfill expectations, there are many alternatives. One would be the Aspire model with a dedicated GPU. Acer's Aspire E1-572G (Core i5-4200U, Radeon HD 8750M) renders most games well. Some retailers list the laptop for below 500 Euros (~$672) at the time of writing.
