            "Process field instrument with integrated sensor unit and related system and method - A sensor is integrated with a field instrument in a process control system. For example, the sensor can be at least partially housed in a housing of the field instrument. The sensor could also receive operating power from a power source in the field instrument. The sensor could further communicate using a wired interface and/or a wireless interface of the field instrument. Multiplexing techniques could be used to allow normal communications for the field instrument and information associated with the sensor. For instance, field instrument data and sensor data could be transmitted over different interfaces or multiplexed in time for communication over a single interface. Sensor data could also be included as at least one diagnostic or configuration variable along with the field instrument data. The field instrument could represent a gas meter associated with a gas distribution network, and the sensor could represent a gas sensor.",
            "APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING A FAILSAFE-ENABLED WIRELESS DEVICE - A method for operating a failsafe-enabled wireless device is provided that includes monitoring a signal quality for a wireless signal between a failsafe-enabled wireless device and a controller. A determination is made regarding whether the signal quality is poor. A failsafe procedure is initiated when the signal quality is poor.",
            "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING SELF-LOCATING WIRELESS SENSORS - A wireless sensor network is disclosed that comprises a plurality of wireless sensors and a wireless sensor base station. The wireless sensor base station sends a request to one of the wireless sensors requesting the location information for the selected wireless sensor. The wireless sensor determines its location using a location information determination method, associates its identity information with the location information, and sends the identity information and the location information to the wireless sensor base station. The wireless sensor continuously sends updated location information to the wireless sensor base station as the wireless sensor moves within the wireless sensor network. The wireless sensor base station displays the identity information and the location information of the wireless sensor on a display unit."

Becker, Research Triangle Park, NC US Patent application number Description Published 20110088014 AUTOMATED TEST EXECUTION PLAN GENERATION - A set of user-configured testing parameters for a software application under test can be received by a test execution plan generation tool. At least one testing objective for the software application can be defined by user-configurable testing parameters. A test execution plan can be automatically generated utilizing the user-configured testing parameters and a predefined test execution plan data model. The predefined test execution plan data model can include testing metadata representing software testing domain data for a software testing system being used to evaluate the software application under test. The testing metadata can specify details of finite shared resources of a test center shared by all projects under test. The generated test execution plan can detail specific allocation of the finite shared resources dedicated towards at least one phase of testing the software application to satisfy the at least one testing objective for the software application. 04-14-2011 20120151448 AUTOMATED TEST EXECUTION PLAN GENERATION - A set of user-configured testing parameters for a software application under test can be received by a test execution plan generation tool.
