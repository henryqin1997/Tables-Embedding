It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, alternative constructions, and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention. By default, the call to Shrink may be synchronous and does not return until the entire shrink operation is complete. If it is not desirable to wait for the shrink to complete, the NOWAIT parameter can be specified, whereby the call returns asynchronously and shrink continues running. If QUERYMAX is specified, DiskPart displays an estimated maximum size that can reclaimed from the volume. If DESIRED/MINIMUM are not supplied, the command results in the code attempting to shrink to the best possible size (e.g., obtained via QueryMaxReclaimableBytes). If one value is supplied but not the other, the code assumes the other to be the same value. SHRINK [DESIRED=<Desired reclaimable bytes in MB>] [MINIMUM=<Minimum reclaimable bytes in MB>] [NOWAIT] [NOERR] SHRINK QUERYMAX DISKPART.EXE supports a new command named SHRINK.
