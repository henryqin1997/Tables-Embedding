Tony P. | 09/03/2012 Read Full Review Nice and cozy.... Nice and cozy for a small family. Love the layout of the place and how close you are to the beach. Its clean and stocked to fit your basic needs. Plus you get Free beach service. It was uncrowded and quiet during the time we stay. Enjoyed every moment of it. Only thing is that the water is murky(brown) and not blue",
