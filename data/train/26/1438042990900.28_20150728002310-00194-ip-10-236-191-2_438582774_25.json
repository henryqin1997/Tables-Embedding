    "textBeforeTable": "2012 ranking: 1 2013 location: Double-A Chattanooga/Majors ETA: late-2013 - For the second consecutive year, Lee tops the Dodgers' prospect list. He got the edge over some of the higher ceiling prospects in the system due to his consistency and high floor. The 2010 first-rounder began his 2012 season with the Quakes before being promoted to the Lookouts. Lee has a great feel for pitching, especially for a guy who turned 21 in September. Lee has a nice variety of pitches, but none really standout out as plus-plus pitches. His fastball sits in the low-90s and has some movement. He also has a curveball, changeup and the ever-popular cut fastball. He's also tinkered with a slider in the past. Lee isn't a strikeout pitcher, but he does have a 7.6 strikeouts per nine for his career, which is definitely acceptable. The term \"pitchabilty\" comes to mind when thinking about Lee. Despite reaching Double-A in his second full season, Lee is at at least a year away from contributing as a starting pitcher in the majors. His career-high for innings pitched is 117 1/3, which he established this year. He could be a September call-up, but I wouldn't expect him to make his debut until 2014. 1. Zach Lee, RHP (6'4, 190, 21 years old)",

Yasiel Puig, RF (6'3, 215, 22 years old) - Puig was inked to a record $42 million international contract in July and has impressed nearly everyone with his physique. However, he hasn't logged a lot of time on the field (91 plate appearances). He's playing in the Puerto Rican Winter League after being forced to sit out the Arizona Fall League due to a staph infection in his elbow. Puig's ceiling is that of Vladimir Guerrero, but it obviously remains to be seen if he even gets close to the future Hall of Famer. Puig has power potential to all fields and, as of now, has at least above-average speed. His arm is suitable for right field. Puig's biggest question is his hit tool, as there just isn't a lot of data on it. It'll be interesting to see how he does in his first full season of professional baseball. 2012 ranking: 4 (midseason)",
