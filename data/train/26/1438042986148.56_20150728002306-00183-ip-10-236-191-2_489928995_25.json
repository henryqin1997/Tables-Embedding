Also, for the purpose of forming a metal film on the substrate a process such as vapor deposition, plating or etching may be additionally provided before separating the ground substrate from the support. Particularly, in the case of a silicon wafer, the support is sometimes subjected to a high-temperature process to form an oxide film. Accordingly, a support having heat resistance, chemical resistance and a low expansion coefficient is selected. Examples of support materials having these properties include borosilicate glass available as Pyrex\u2122 and Tenpax\u2122 and alkaline earth boro-aluminosilicate glass such as Corning\u2122 #1737 and #7059., 20108=In various fields, reducing the thickness of a substrate often is desired. For example, in the field of quartz devices, reducing the thickness of a quartz wafer is desired so as to increase the oscillation frequency. Particularly, in the semiconductor industry, efforts to further reduce the thickness of a semiconductor wafer are in progress to respond to the goal of reducing the thickness of semiconductor packages as well as the high-density fabrication by chip lamination technology. Thickness reduction is performed by so-called back side grinding of a semiconductor wafer on the surface opposite that containing pattern-formed circuitry. Usually, in conventional techniques of grinding the back side, or surface, of a wafer and conveying it while holding the wafer with only a backgrinding protective tape, thickness reduction can be accomplished in practice only to a thickness of about 150 micrometers (\u03bcm) because of problems such as uneven thickness of the ground wafer or warping of the wafer with protective tape after grinding. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 6-302569 discloses a method where a wafer is held on a ring-form frame through a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape, the back surface of this wafer held on the frame is ground and the wafer is conveyed to the next step. However, this method has not yet attained a remarkable improvement over the present level of wafer thickness which may be obtained without encountering the aforementioned problems of unevenness or warpage.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The laminated body of the present invention enables the separating of a substrate ground to a very small thickness, from a support without damaging the substrate. The support and the substrate are separated by a radiation energy such as a laser beam, so that the joining layer can be easily separated from the substrate by peeling and an ultrathin substrate can be manufactured without damaging the substrate. It was also confirmed that the intermediate layer and the pressure-sensitive adhesive were removed en bloc from the glass substrate surface. The glass substrate could be recycled by washing it with ethyl alcohol and pure water. Furthermore, since a multilayer optical film which transmits light necessary for curing the photocurable adhesive to form a joining layer and reflects laser light necessary for the radiation energy treatment was used, the joining layer could be cured without any problem and at the same time, the circuitry pattern on the wafer could be protected from damage by the laser light. It was confirmed that the adhesive layer was removed together with the film from the wafer surface without causing rupturing of the adhesive layer. On the wafer surface, residual glue and the like were not observed. Results: A laminated body was produced and tested in the same manner as in Example 15 except that a multilayer optical film (3M\u2122 Solar Reflecting Film, from 3M) was used in",
