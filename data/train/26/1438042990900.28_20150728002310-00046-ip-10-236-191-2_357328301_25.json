The ipv6-prefix must be in the form documented in RFC 2373 where the address is specified in hexadecimal using 16-bit values between colons. The prefix length is a decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). For example, 2001:DB8:8086:6502::/32 is a valid IPv6 prefix., 52899=0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1, 59927=IPv6, formerly named IPng (next generation), is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP). IP is a packet-based protocol used to exchange data, voice, and video traffic over digital networks. IPv6 was proposed when the 32-bit addressing scheme of IP version 4 (IPv4) proved to be inadequate to meet the demands of Internet growth. IPv6 is based on IP but with a much larger address space and improvements such as a simplified main header and extension headers. IPv6 is described in RFC 2460, Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification, issued by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Further RFCs describe the architecture and services supported by IPv6.}",
