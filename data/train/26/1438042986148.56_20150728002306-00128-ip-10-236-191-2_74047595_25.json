For example, if you enter the word computer for the with all words search behavior and you select both the Solution Description and Solution Summary fields as searchable fields, the system returns solutions that have the word computer found in their solution description or solution summary. Similarly, if the search behavior is without the words (and everything else remains the same), the system returns solutions that do not have the word computer in either the solution description or solution summary. In this case, if the word computer appears in the solution description but not the solution summary, the solution returns as a result of the search.
