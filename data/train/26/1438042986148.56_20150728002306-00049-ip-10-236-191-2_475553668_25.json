Here, the tension is the value measured at a position just after emerging from the heater. In the case of a number of heater zones, it is the tension in the yarn at a position just after emerging from the first heater. The heater temperature is the atmospheric temperature measured, with no yarn passing, by means of a temperature sensor fitted at a position within 1 cm of the route along which the yarn travels. The processing speed is the yarn speed at the driving means following the final heat treatment. As the polyester, there is employed polyethylene terephthalate or a copolymer chiefly comprising polyethylene terephthalate., 31605=As stated above, by high temperature heat treatment of the intermediate polyester fibre it is possible to effect transformation into a highly elastic polyester fibre with the properties (B). The characteristics thereof are (1) a degree of crystallinity, at 22-30%, and preferably 24-28%, about the same as that of conventional polyester drawn fibre, (2) an isotropic crystal size, that is to say 2.5-4.5 nm for Miller index 010, 2.5-4.5 for Miller index 100, and 2.0-4.5 nm for Miller index 105, and the difference between the crystal sizes for the respective Miller indices is no more than 1.0 nm and preferably no more than 0.7 nm, (3) a low degree of amorphous orientation, namely 0.15-0.40 and preferably 0.20-0.32, (4) a high amorphous density, namely 1.31-1.37 g/cm3 and preferably 1.34-1.37 g/cm3, and (5) in particular, the value of the amorphous density/degree of amorphous orientation is extremely high, being at least 3.2 and preferably at least 4.0. As the mechanism of the manifestation of rubber elasticity, it is assumed that there is formed a network structure which is fully relaxed, of a high degree of freedom and which has high density amorphous regions constrained by isotropic crystalline regions. In terms of function, the fibre possesses rubber elasticity inconceivable in a polyester fibre, that is to say the fibre characteristics based on the properties obtained from the load-extension curve, which are shown in the following table, comprise a high value of initial elongation of at least 10% and preferably at least 15%, a low value of initial stress of no more than 1.5 g/d, and a low value of Young's modulus of no more than 140 kgf/mm2 and preferably no more than 100 kgf/mm2. The values indicate that good resiliency, shape retention (dimensional stability) and flexibility are shown, and in particular in the case of thick or high pile fabrics there are exhibited cushioning properties with a good handle and outstandingly high recovery from repeated compression. Furthermore, the characteristics in the following table clearly show that as a result of the high temperature heat treatment of fibre (i) or (ii) which lie in the range of property values (A), there is transformation to fibre (iii), (iv) or (v) which possess property values (B)., 42544=The thickness of the polyester fibre employed in the present invention is not particularly restricted but, in general, there is preferably employed fibre of individual fineness 1 to 200 denier, in the form of yarn of total denier from 20 to 1000., 20839=(5) Amorphous density 1.31-1.37 g/cm3,, 52565=This was measured by wide angle X-ray diffraction (diffractometer method) as follows, based on the method of W. ruland (W. Ruland, Acta Cryst., 14 (1961), 1180-1185), 41286=Tensile strength: This was based on JIS-L 1013., 52420=This was based on the density gradient column method in 7.14.2 of JIS-L 1013., 70200=Now, the fibre density was measured by the density gradient column method in 7.14.2 of JIS-L1013.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes v) Fibre obtained from the polyester fibre of the present invention and fabric thereof do not readily exhibit stress concentrations in that they posses rubber elasticity, so it is possible to obtain fabrics of high tear strength, impact absorption properties and resistance to pilling. iv) In the case where used as the centre yarn (splicing yarn or pillar yarn) of a spatial fabric such as a knitted spacer fabric, performance is good even without employing fusion bonding fibre or false-twist textured yarn as in conventional products, and since the yarn itself is of low price and processing is simple, production can be carried out cheaply. iii) Fabric obtained from the polyester fibre of the present invention possesses the aforesaid characteristics to a high degree, so there is no need to compensate for inadequate performance by providing a layer of polyurethane foam as in conventional materials, and therefore there is a considerable cost advantage and, since a structure comprising only polyester fibre is possible, this is environmentally beneficial. ii) Fabric obtained from the polyester fibre of the present invention can possess outstanding resistance to permanent yielding (resistance to pile damage, pile tilting, etc), and outstanding bulkiness and cushioning properties. In particular, remarkable effects are obtained in the multilayer fabrics known as spatial fabrics such as knitted spacer fabrics. i) The polyester fibre of the present invention can provide fibre and fabrics which are outstanding in their",
