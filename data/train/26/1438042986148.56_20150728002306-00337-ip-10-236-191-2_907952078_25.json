Their school is very Christ-centered and excellence-driven. With an approximate 11:1 student to faculty ration, professors genuinely care about you and want to be a part of each of their student's success., 194004=The campus is really safe. Unlike many larger schools, Union in 2013 had very few offences. Of these offences, none were physically confrontational. There was eight disorderly conduct offences and one trespassing offence in 2013. There was also 21 reported case of burglary. Compared to other, albeit larger, schools this is remarkably low. Some public state schools have longer lists of crimes that have occurred in the last two months., 77199=I went on a campus visit in March, and was struck by the passion exhibited by both students and professors at Union. It was obvious that they were dedicated to both faith and learning--demonstrating their own motto: Excellence driven, Christ centered. The high academic level and the welcoming atmosphere have ranked it high on my list!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Union's professors are top-notch. Almost all of them are active in their field; different professors are constantly churning out books and speaking at conferences. In fact, many of the professors came to Union from teaching at a grad school or seminary. The curriculum is distinctly oriented on the liberal arts and rooted in a conservative biblical tradition. Other Christian schools have abandoned their conservative heritage, but the liberals on faculty at Union are few and far between. The class sizes range from 2 to the 20s; even the core classes have no more than 20-something students. Most professors genuinely care about the students' learning and gear their classes accordingly.
