            "Until the homecoming football game all freshman are considered Frosh and have to wear hats the color of our rival school, BHSU. The tradition claims that SDSMT freshman are smarter than the seniors at BHSU.",
            "Extremely reasonable tuition! The Tablet PC program may seem expensive to some, but it is really great considering the perks you get from it. Not the most beautiful campus, but you'll probably be spending most of your time studying anyway.",
            "Once tourist season is over in Rapid, there isn't much to do, so students have to rely on themselves for entertainment. Movies, board games and just general goofing off is what students usually do. My roommates and I usually went bowling 1 or 2 times a month.",
            "The options are very limited for food on campus. It's good for the first couple of weeks, and then it get old very quickly.",
            "Things can get kind of boring in Rapid City, but if you make the right friends, you can usually find a way to have fun.",
            "Be prepared to work hard, and make it a point to connect with fellow students and professors right away!",
            "SDSM&T is a great place to find friends if you are normally considered a nerd, but beyond that it is a great place to get an education because classes are small, professors are accessible and because everyone is an engineering or science major, you can find help everywhere when you need it. Overall, it's a great school!"
