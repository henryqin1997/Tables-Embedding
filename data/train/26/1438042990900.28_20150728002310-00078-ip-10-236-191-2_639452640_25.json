All other measurements, such as chest and hip, remain the same. Please refer to our new, updated Women's Size Chart for details. Note: this change applies to full-price Spring 2015 styles, not to past-season or on-sale items.}",

Since you stay both dryer and warmer, you\u2019re able to maintain your comfort over a wide temperature range, which results in fewer layering changes and a lighter, less bulky pack. The lofted hollow-core fibers of Regulator\u00ae fleece insulation conserve body heat while allowing body moisture to wick uninhibited.
