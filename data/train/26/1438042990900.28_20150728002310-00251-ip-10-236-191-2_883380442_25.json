            "The campus is in the neighborhood of a very bad area, but it still has a safe feeling with campus security always around.",
            "Very limited greek life; 1 frat and 1 sorority.",
            "There's honestly something for everyone and if there's not, you have the option to start your own club!",
            "It's great for people who come from a catholic background but there are also students from multiple religions on campus (including atheism). A lot of kids come from private catholic schools but I came from a public school and I love CUA.",
            "The basilica is CUA's pride and joy.",
            "It's a great school, but also an expensive one. Apply to as many scholarships and loans as you can!",
            "In DC, everything a student could want is just a metro ride away.",
            "Limited on weekends, but they really do try and be creative with the food that they serve!",
            "Honestly, some dorms are much better than others! Male dorms, for instance, are constantly messy and chaotic.",
            "Classes are hard if you don't keep up with the work. You'll find yourself pulling quite a few all nighters if you don't stay on top of assignments and due dates but the actual work is not incredibly difficult or un-doable.",
            "Keep an open mind, especially when entering DC. I was born and raised in a small town so it was a bit of a shock to be introduced to all of DC, but I'm so happy I chose to branch out. I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "Catholic University is what you make it. It's location is incredible and unique, with the metro located conveniently on campus. The faculty and classwork really contribute to a great overall atmosphere."

Security in the traditional style dorms is pretty strict and all visitors have to be signed in after around 4 o'clock. The suite style living in Centennial Village is nice, but the traditional dorm buildings are nicer style wise., 114785=Catholic has a lot of fun traditions like dances and cookouts. There are a lot of religious traditions as well, one being the March for Life, which a huge fraction of the student body participate in every year. The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception is on campus, which is the largest Catholic church in America and is truly a sight to see., 142504=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 7539=The food is okay, a bit overpriced though. But the dining hall opens from 7:30 everyday and closes at midnight during the week and 2 a.m. on the weekends so very convenient. Also there is a separate Starbucks another food court and a connivence store all in one building, in addition to all the great restaurants in D.C.}",

    "textAfterTable": "For how much you pay, there are a lot of benefits. Cafe open until midnight or 2 a.m., 24 hour computer lab, 24 hour library, fitness center open until 1 a.m., on campus access to metro, and many other amenities many universities do not have, but i would still say a bit overpriced. What to do for fun Since the university is located in the middle of D.C. the possibilities are endless. The zoo, museums, chinatown, night clubs, shopping at Dupont Circle, movies, warner theater, paintball, and so so much more in addition to the Capital where all the monuments are. Food and Dining The food is okay, a bit overpriced though. But the dining hall opens from 7:30 everyday and closes at midnight during the week and 2 a.m. on the weekends so very convenient. Also there is a separate Starbucks another food court and a connivence store all in one building, in addition to all the great restaurants in D.C. Dorm Life The dorm life is about average. New policy this year stated that single sex dorms will be put into full effect all over campus aside from one dorm. Some may see this as a down fall, but i personally",
