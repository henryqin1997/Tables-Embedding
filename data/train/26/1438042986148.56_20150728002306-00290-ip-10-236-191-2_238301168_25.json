    "textBeforeTable": "How Can I Move Up a Level? When I was a classroom teacher, I collected the logs once a week to make sure my students were reading and recording and that parents were aware of how much or how little their child was reading.\u00a0 In addition, some teachers have students complete an index card with the title of the book, the author, and give a brief synopsis of the book on the other side of the card.\u00a0 It is a good idea to also monitor how long a child is taking to complete one book.\u00a0 If you use the Fountas and Pinell leveling system in your school (most NYC schools use this system), here is a useful table your students can use. You can also share it with their parents to get them more involved. Reading Logs Reading Logs come in all shapes and sizes, formats and designs.\u00a0 You can access existing ones by googling \u201creading logs\u201d or simply make your own. Logs are usually specific to early grades, upper elementary and middle school and usually include date, title of book, author, genre, pages read. Some may include a parental signature.\u00a0 Including the parental signature involves the families to help students track their reading and adds accountability to what and how much they have read. Two ways to motivate your students to read, are Reading Logs and The 100 Book Challenge: they will build their stamina, help them meet their minimum 25 book per year",
    "textAfterTable": "100 Book Challenge Another way to build motivation is to have a 100 book challenge.\u00a0 This is great for motivation when started in the beginning of the school year, but can be initiated at any time.\u00a0 Parents should be informed of the challenge by a flyer and be encouraged to root on their children to read more at school and at home. When a whole class reads 100 books as a class (or their second 100), the whole class will have a celebration (decided upon by the class).\u00a0 In the middle school I am working in this year, it was a class wide challenge and also a school-wide challenge.\u00a0 The classes that got to their 100 books decided to design a day of school the way the students wanted.\u00a0 When my son had a 100 book challenge, once met their goal, they had an in class slumber party.\u00a0 All students and teachers wore their pjs to school and brought pillows, sleeping bags, and stuffed animals and spent the day lounging around reading more books. Keeping reading logs and having 100 book challenges are only two ways to increase student motivation and stamina for reading.\u00a0 Including families in this process will only help to assure your students are successful and stay motivated.
