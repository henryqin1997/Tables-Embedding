MINISTRY OF SOUND Anthems: Electronic 80's Volumes 1, 2 & 3 -9CD Set- ANTHEMS: ELECTRONIC 80s VOLUME 1 The Ministry of Sound label's Anthems: Electronic '80s collects 60 U.K.-centric new wave/electro-pop nuggets over the span of three discs. Compilations of this sort (generic title, budget artwork) rarely deliver on such a grand scale, but Anthems\u2019 compilers have shown their love for the genre by cherry-picking the cream of the crop from the era. Ultravox, Tubeway Army, Sigue Sigue Sputnik, Joy Division, Paul Hardcastle, Giorgio Moroder, A Flock of Seagulls, and Blondie may have shared airtime on underground radio, but their appearance on anything other than a 90-minute mixtape handcrafted in the bedroom of an angst-filled, wavy-haired teen is a joy to behold. ANTHEMS: ELECTRONIC 80s VOLUME 2 Following the success of their first Anthems: Electronic 80s compilation, the Ministry of Sound label returns with another collection incorporating the best synth pop, New Romantic, and indie dance tunes of the colorful and inventive decade. Alongside number ones from the Human League, Kraftwerk, and the Communards, there are iconic tracks from Spandau Ballet, Eurythmics, and Duran Duran, one-hit wonders (Kim Carnes' \"Bette Davis Eyes,\" New Musik's \"Living by Numbers\"), and less familiar material from the likes of Devo, Laid Back, and Re-Flex. Highlights from the first disc include Talk Talk's gloriously atmospheric \"It's My Life,\" Scritti Politti's reggae-fused \"The Word Girl\" and Frankie Goes to Hollywood's anthemic \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome.\" Erasure's infectious hi-NRG pop classic \"A Little Respect,\" Altered Images' impossibly uplifting \"I Could Be Happy\" and the Communards' chart-topping cover version of \"Don't Leave Me This Way\" provide the standouts for Disc Two, while Simple Minds' Brat Pack staple \"Don't You Forget About Me,\" Stock, Aitken and Waterman's finest moment, Dead or Alive's \"You Spin Me Round (Like A Record),\" and New Order's brooding, bass-heavy \"True Faith\" are the choice cuts from the third disc. However, as the first compilation gathered many of the decade's biggest electro hits, this second volume seems to struggle to fill its 60 tracks. Indeed, it's hard to see quite how the likes of Billy Idol's \"White Wedding\" and the Stranglers' \"Golden Brown\" fit into the genre, which makes the lack of Pet Shop Boys and Depeche Mode, arguably two of the biggest synth pop groups of the '80s, even more puzzling. But even though it suffers from occasional padding, Anthems: Electronic '80s, Vol. 2 is still a consistently enjoyable retrospective of one of the most influential and innovative musical eras. ANTHEMS: ELECTRONIC 80s VOLUME 3 Having sold over a million copies, Anthems Electronic 80s returns this winter with the monumental third instalment in the phenomenal series. This 60-track album showcases not only the decade which brought electronic synth sounds to the forefront of chart music but also the ultra cool credible side of the 80s, and this summer saw a whole host of definitive tracks played at the Olympic Games from the likes of Kate Bush and Annie Lennox. This, coupled with brand new tours from the likes of Depeche Mode and New Order truly fortifies the return of 80s New Wave to the mainstream. The album features an array of talent with classic tracks from The Human League, Duran Duran, ABC, Spandau Ballet, and Nick Kershaw before we dive into the cooler electronic sound of the decade with tracks from O.M.D, Jan Hammer, and Erasure. We end with a plethora of the biggest artists and characters to grace the era including massive hits from David Bowie, Grace Jones, Kate Bush, Eurythmics, INXS, Blondie, New Order, Gary Newman and Peter Gabriel.
