            "The methods used to develop these data for the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program are documented in LIDAR Bare Earth Mass Points and Breaklines Technical Document, available online at www.ncfloodmaps.com.",
            "All data collection flights were initialized and finalized during periods of GPS Position Dilution of Precision greater than 4. GPS data quality was evaluated post-flight to ensure sufficient quality for LIDAR data requirements and integration. GPS base maximum allowable distance between stations was established such that no more than a 50 mile radius occurred between occupations. Swath width of terrain covered in a single flightline for inland areas at an altitude of 12,000 feet AMT was approximately 3,411 meters, coastal areas at an altitude of 8,000 feet AMT was approximately 2,274 meters. Field of View for the Leica GeoSystems Aeroscan system used was 50 degrees project wide, or 25 degrees from nadir with a maximum of 5 returns collected for each pulse. Ground distance between flightlines for inland areas at 12,000 feet AMT was approximately 2,388 meters, for coastal areas at 8,000 feet AMT was approximately 1,592 meters. Nominal post spacing for finalized Bare Earth product was 3 meters. An average of 10-20 rapid static GPS survey collected ground control points were established per base airport project wide to detect and correct horizontal and vertical bias. Typically, 3 or more flightlines of LIDAR returns were collected for each airport lift, one of which being bi-directional for use in optimizing instrument boresight angles to account for aircraft pitch, yaw and roll. All post process collection quality assurance is achieved aided by airport cross and bi-directional flightlines, entire lift cross flightlines, and the use of surveyed ground control points.",

            "The lidar point data were received by the NOAA Coastal Services Center from the USGS Center for Lidar Coordination and Knowledge (CLICK) in las format. The files contained lidar elevation and intensity measurements. The data were unclassified, in State Plane coordinates, and were vertically referenced to NAVD88. CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The data were converted from State Plane coordinates to geographic coordinates. 2. The data were converted from orthometric (NAVD88) heights to ellipsoidal heights using Geoid99. 3. The data were sorted by time. 4. The data were converted to LAZ format.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
