This is normally sponsored by a club or resource on campus. There are different kinds of snacks, and drinks for an hour from 3:30-4:30. It's a great time to hang out with your friends, catch up with old classmates, or get a chance to talk to an old or current professor. They are heavily attended, and are a great Scripps tradition., 96642=Our residence hallsare beautiful and really comfortable places to live. I love that people generally respect the quiet hours (10:00pm on school nights, 1:00 am on weekends) so that you can get some sleep, but there are always activities, study groups, cooking, and other things going on during the day.}",

The most common crime is bicycle theft (lock your bikes), but I've heard of people leaving their laptops unattended in the library and finding them untouched upon returning. Greek Life There is a joke that says that Scripps is one big sorority, but there is not actually any Greek Life on campus. Clubs and Activities CLORGs range from Challah for Hunger and Women in Science to the Fine Cheese Club and Babes and Blankets. Great for these types of students nerdy, open minded, interested in learning Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus Every Wednesday afternoon, Scripps students and faculty come out for afternoon tea. Another food tradition is Evening Snack (as opposed to midnight snack) on Tuesday nights. Other traditions include birthday (or half-birthday/quarter-birthday/your-friends-felt-like-it) fountainings and sunbathing on the quad whenever it",
