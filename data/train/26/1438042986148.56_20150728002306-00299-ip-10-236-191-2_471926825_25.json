Anal. Calcd For C14H11N3O6: C, 53.00; H, 3.49; N, 13.24. Found: C, 52.77; H, 3.29; N, 13.00., 27665=Monocytes, macrophages, and related cells, such as kupffer and glial cells, also have been implicated in maintenance of the HIV infection. These cells, like T cells, are targets for viral replication and the level of viral replication is dependent upon the activation state of the cells. {Rosenberg et al., The Immunopathogenesis of HIV Infection, Advances in Immunology, 57 (1989)}. Cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1, have been shown to activate HIV replication in monocytes and/or macrophages {Poli et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 87, 782-784 (1990)}, therefore, prevention or inhibition of cytokine production or activity aids in limiting HIV progression for T cells. Additional studies have identified TNF\u03b1 as a common factor in the activation of HIV in vitro and has provided a clear mechanism of action via a nuclear regulatory protein found in the cytoplasm of cells (Osborn, et al., PNAS 86 2336-2340). This evidence suggests that a reduction of TNF\u03b1 synthesis may have an antiviral effect in HIV infections, by reducing the transcription and thus virus production., 28782=AIDS viral replication of latent HIV in T cell and macrophage lines can be induced by TNF\u03b1 {Folks et al., PNAS 86, 2365-2368 (1989)}. A molecular mechanism for the virus inducing activity is suggested by TNF\u03b1's ability to activate a gene regulatory protein (NF\u03baB) found in the cytoplasm of cells, which promotes HIV replication through binding to a viral regulatory gene sequence (LTR) {Osborn et al., PNAS 86, 2336-2340 (1989)}. TNF\u03b1 in AIDS associated cachexia is suggested by elevated serum TNF\u03b1 and high levels of spontaneous TNF\u03b1 production in peripheral blood monocytes from patients {Wright et al., J. Immunol. 141(1). 99-104 (1988)}. TNF\u03b1 has been implicated in various roles with other viral infections, such as the cytomegalia virus (CMV), influenza virus, adenovirus, and the herpes family of viruses for similar reasons as those noted., 149192=1-Oxo-2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-4,5,6,7-tetrafluoroisoindoline is dissolved in 1000 mL of water and filtered through a microfilter. The buffer solution is added and the whole is made up to 2500 mL with water.

Nat. Acad Sci. 86, 5974-5978 (1989); Poll et al., Proc. Nat. Acad Sci. 87, 782-785 (1990); Monto et al., Blood 79, 2670 (1990); Clouse et al., J. Immunol. 142, 431-438 (1989); Poll et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retrovirus, 191-197 (1992)}. AIDS results from the infection of T lymphocytes with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). At least three types or strains of HIV have been identified, i.e., HIV-1, HIV-2 and HIV-3. As a consequence of HIV infection, T-cell mediated immunity is impaired and infected individuals manifest severe opportunistic infections and/or unusual neoplasms. HIV entry into the T lymphocyte requires T lymphocyte activation. Other viruses, such as HIV-1, HIV-2 infect T lymphocytes after T cell activation and such virus protein expression and/or replication is mediated or maintained by such T cell activation. Once an activated T lymphocyte is infected with HIV, the T lymphocyte must continue to be maintained in an activated state to permit HIV gene expression and/or HIV replication. Cytokines, specifically TNF\u03b1, are implicated in activated T-cell mediated HIV protein expression and/or virus replication by playing a role in maintaining T lymphocyte activation. Therefore, interference with cytokine activity such as by prevention or inhibition of cytokine production, notably TNF\u03b1, in an HIV-infected individual assists in limiting the maintenance of T lymphocyte caused by HIV infection., 22761=Cerebral malaria is a lethal hyperacute neurological syndrome associated with high blood levels of TNF\u03b1 and the most severe complication occurring in malaria patients. Levels of serum TNF\u03b1 correlated directly with the severity of disease and the prognosis in patients with acute malaria attacks {Grau et al., N. Engl. J.

When activated, leukocytes will produce bone-resorption, an activity to which the data suggest TNF\u03b1 contributes. {Bertolini et al., Nature 319, 516-518 (1986) and Johnson et al., Endocrinology 124(3), 1424-1427 (1989).} TNF\u03b1 also has been shown to stimulate bone resorption and inhibit bone formation in vitro and in vivo through stimulation of osteoclast formation and activation combined with inhibition of osteoblast function. Although TNF\u03b1 may be involved in many bone resorption diseases, including arthritis, the most compelling link with disease is the association between production of TNF\u03b1 by tumor or host tissues and malignancy associated hypercalcemia {Calci.

When administered to animals or humans, it causes inflammation, fever, cardiovascular effects, hemorrhage, coagulation, and acute phase responses similar to those seen during acute infections and shock states. Excessive or unregulated TNF\u03b1 production thus has been implicated in a number of disease conditions. These include endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome {Tracey et al., Nature 330, 662-664 (1987) and Hinshaw et al., Circ. Shock 30, 279-292 (1990)}; cachexia {Dezube et al., Lancet, 335 (8690), 662 (1990)} and Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome where TNF\u03b1 concentration in excess of 12,000 pg/mL have been detected in pulmonary aspirates from ARDS patients {Millar et al., Lancet 2(8665), 712-714 (1989)}.

Protecting groups utilized herein denote groups which generally are not found in the final therapeutic compounds but which are intentionally introduced at some stage of the synthesis in order to protect groups which otherwise might be altered in the course of chemical manipulations. Such protecting groups are removed at a later stage of the synthesis and compounds bearing such protecting groups thus are of importance primarily as chemical intermediates (although some derivatives also exhibit biological activity). Accordingly the precise structure of the protecting group is not critical. Numerous reactions for the formation and removal of such protecting groups are described in a number of standard works including, for example, \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\u201d, Plenum Press, London and New York, 1973; Greene, Th. W. \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\u201d, Wiley, New York, 1981; \u201cThe Peptides\u201d, Vol. 1, Schr\ufffdder and Lubke, Academic Press, London and New York, 1965; \u201cMethoden der organischen Chemie\u201d, Houben-Weyl, 4th Edition, Vol. 15/I, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. An amino group can be protected as an amide utilizing an acyl group which is selectively removable under mild conditions, especially benzyloxycarbonyl, formyl, or a lower alkanoyl group which is branched in 1- or \u03b1 position to the carbonyl group, particularly tertiary alkanoyl such as pivaloyl, a lower alkanoyl group which is substituted in the position \u03b1 to the carbonyl group, as for example trifluoroacetyl., 24623=TNF\u03b1 is also implicated in the inflammatory response which follows reperfusion, called reperfusion injury, and is a major cause of tissue damage after loss of blood flow {Vedder et al., PNAS 87, 2643-2646 (1990)}. TNF\u03b1 also alters the properties of endothelial cells and has various pro-coagulant activities, such as producing an increase in tissue factor pro-coagulant activity and suppression of the anticoagulant protein C pathway as well as down-regulating the expression of thrombomodulin {Sherry et al., J. Cell Biol. 107, 1269-1277 (1988)}. TNF\u03b1 has pro-inflammatory activities which together with its early production (during the initial stage of an inflammatory event) make it a likely mediator of tissue injury in several important disorders including but not limited to, myocardial infarction, stroke and circulatory shock. Of specific importance may be TNF\u03b1-induced expression of adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) or endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM) on endothelial cells {Munro et al., Am. J. Path. 135(1), 121-132 (1989)}., 29683=The nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB) is a pleiotropic transcriptional activator (Lenardo, et al., Cell 1989, 58, 227-29). NF\u03baB has been implicated as a transcriptional activator in a variety of disease and inflammatory states and is thought to regulate cytokine levels including but not limited to TNF\u03b1 and also to be an activator of HIV transcription (Dbaibo, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1993, 17762-66; Duh et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989, 86, 5974-78; Bachelerie et, al., Nature 1991, 350, 709-12; Boswas et al., J. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome 1993, 6, 778-786; Suzuki et al., Biochem. And Biophys. Res. Comm. 1993, 193, 277-83; Suzuki et al., Biochem. And Biophys. Res Comm. 1992, 189, 1709-15; Suzuki et al., Biochem. Mol. Bio. Int. 1993, 31(4), 693-700; Shakhov et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1990, 171, 35-47; and Staal et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1990, 87, 9943-47). Thus, inhibition of NF\u03baB binding can regulate transcription of cytokine gene(s) and through this modulation and other mechanisms be useful in the inhibition of a multitude of disease states. The compounds described herein can inhibit the action of NF\u03baB in the nucleus and thus are useful in the treatment of a variety of diseases including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, other arthritic conditions, septic shock, septis, endotoxic shock, graft versus host disease, wasting, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythrematosis, ENL in leprosy, HIV, AIDS, and opportunistic infections in AIDS. TNF\u03b1 and NF\u03baB levels are influenced by a reciprocal feedback loop.
