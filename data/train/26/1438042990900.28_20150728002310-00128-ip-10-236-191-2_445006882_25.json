            "BRAKE SERVO - A brake servo whose valve piston has a concentric sealing seat which projects axially beyond a second sealing seat, with the concentric sealing seat having at least one recess for throttling the air volume flow. The controllability and also the noise characteristics of the brake servo can be improved in this way.",

            "MASTER CYLINDER IN PARTICULAR FOR A CONTROLLED MOTOR VEHICLE BRAKE SYSTEM - The invention relates to a master cylinder, in particular for a controlled motor vehicle brake system, including a first and a second piston which is displaceable in a housing and has a captive spring, a first end of the spring bearing at least indirectly against the piston and a second end thereof against a sleeve which is displaceable with respect to the piston and the movement of which with respect to the piston is limited by a pin provided on the piston and by a stop washer, the stop washer being arranged on a free end of the pin. In order to avoid impact noise upon rapid release of the brake, the stop washer of the first piston has a device for the damped abutment of the sleeve.",
            "MOTOR-PUMP UNIT - A motor-pump unit, for providing pressure for a brake actuating device having a pneumatic brake booster including a pump and an electric motor driving the pump, the pump being a dual diaphragm pump having two opposed working diaphragms, each of which is clamped between a pump casing and a working chamber cover and delimits a working chamber, and moveable by a crank drive having connecting rods and bearings, the working diaphragm connected firmly to a tappet and, together with the connecting rod, in each case forming a diaphragm unit. In order to provide a low-noise motor-pump unit which is more cost-effective and requires reduced expenditure on assembly, the connecting rods are made of plastic, wherein in each case one tappet and one bearing are encapsulated with the material of the connecting rod. Alternatively, the connecting rods can be formed in one piece with the tappet and provided as sintered components.",
            "MASTER CYLINDER FOR A MOTOR VEHICLE HYDRAULIC BRAKE SYSTEM - A motor vehicle hydraulic brake system master cylinder, having at least one piston which is arranged in a housing and displaceable along an axis as a result of brake actuation and to which a pressure chamber which can be connected to wheel brakes, and a refill chamber is assigned, wherein the pressure chamber in the non-actuated state can be connected to a fluid reservoir via a compensating bore and on actuation of the brake can be isolated therefrom by means of a cup seal arranged on the piston in order to build up pressure. The master cylinder having a cup seal arranged in a radially open, encircling groove of the piston which groove is formed by a first and a second radially encircling projection, wherein when the brake actuation is released additional fluid is drawn from the refill chamber in the direction of the pressure chamber via the second projection.",
            "DEVICE FOR MONITORING THE POSITION AND MOVEMENT OF A BRAKE PEDAL - A device for monitoring the position and movement of a brake pedal for motor vehicles, including a power assist brake actuating unit. The brake actuating unit having a master cylinder fastened to the brake power assist unit, a housing and at least one piston displaceable in a linear manner in the master cylinder, and a position indicator for monitoring the position of the brake pedal. The position indicator transmits signals to a sensor element connected to an electronic control unit. The position indicator is provided on a support coupled to the movement of the control valve housing or to the movable wall that is supported by the control valve housing. The support is guided in a housing of a sensor element, and the housing of the sensor element penetrates in a vacuum-tight manner the power assist unit housing and the housing of the master cylinder having a first housing section."
