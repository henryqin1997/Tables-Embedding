There are also some cool places like the Staple Center, shops, clubs, and more. For me, I realized that I like visiting but not living there but that's also because I'm not a big city person. But if you are, then you'll enjoy it all that it has to offer. Tips for prospective students If you decide to go here, make sure your financial aid is set. Make sure EVERYTHING is set: do your Promissory Note on FASFA Direct Loans, take the quiz on FASFA, and if you plan to live on campus, make sure you're on the plan where you pay every quarter and NOT every month. The housing department has three plans; 1, pay for the academic year, 2, pay quarterly, or 3, pay monthly.",
