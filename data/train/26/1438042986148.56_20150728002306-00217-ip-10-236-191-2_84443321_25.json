We will continue to expand and improve our Federal Sector ADR web page, which serves as a clearinghouse about ADR for federal employees., 66774=We will draw lessons learned from our successful private sector charge processing model. The charge process was overburdened, time-consuming and costly until changes were implemented in the 1990s when the Priority Charge Handling Procedures and a National Enforcement Plan were adopted. Now, it is a more efficient and responsive program; shortening the average time it takes to process a charge and reducing the inventory carried from year-to-year, while reflecting an increase in the successful resolution of charges for charging parties. This is one model we are exploring in our quest to adopt a new and improved federal sector complaint program during fiscal years 2003 and 2004 that can substantially lower federal agency costs. Federal agencies can then reallocate these savings to proactive prevention, early dispute resolution and other strategies that can reduce or resolve conflict in the federal workplace at an earlier stage. We will work with federal agencies, employees and stakeholders to consider viable alternatives for dramatically improving the federal sector process. For example, in early fiscal year 2003, we conducted a public meeting to receive ideas and suggestions about how to improve the federal sector process., 18999=This fiscal year 2004 performance budget reflects EEOC\u2019s initial attempts to integrate the budget with our strategic planning and performance-based programs. EEOC also has embarked on a broad-based, agency-wide review of our GPRA Strategic Plan. We will implement a new Strategic Plan that incorporates all of our key initiatives \u2013 including EEOC\u2019s Five-Point Plan and the President\u2019s Management Agenda \u2013 by October 1, 2003. The new Strategic Plan will guide the implementation of this budget and our annual performance plan in fiscal year 2004., 84654=In addition to the significant gains in processing hearings and appellate cases, we made a significant improvement in fiscal year 2002 in our method and timeliness for federal agencies to report data on their equal employment opportunity counseling and complaint processes. The EEOC collects statistical information from federal agencies and annually publishes the information in a report available to the public. The analyses of this data aid the EEOC in refining the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal equal employment opportunity process and inform the federal community and the public about key characteristics of the program in the federal sector., 125819=In fiscal year 2004, we will take important steps to achieve our PMA goals:, 125954=The NAPA Workforce Restructuring study, and the agency's 5-year restructuring plan that will be developed from it, will have profound influences on our strategic use of our most valuable asset\u2013our employees. Over the 5-year period starting in fiscal year 2003, as resources are realigned for improved customer service, we will be able to identify many priority initiatives to improve our human resources systems, develop employee knowledge and skill in critical aspects of our work, and implement programs designed to improve workforce effectiveness., 153192=Section 717 of Title VII, Section 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, bar discrimination by federal agencies on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, and disability. These sections provide the basis for Commission oversight responsibility for the procedures used by federal departments and agencies in processing internal complaints of discrimination. In addition, the Commission has appellate jurisdiction to review final decisions of departments or agencies on discrimination complaints upon the request of the complainant. It is also responsible for ensuring that federal department and agencies maintain programs of equal employment opportunity. Further, under Executive Order 12067, the Commission provides leadership and coordination to all federal department and agencies' programs enforcing federal statutes, executive orders, regulations, and policies which require equal employment opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability. Coordination is provided to eliminate conflict, competition, duplication, and inconsistency in these programs and to improve their effectiveness. All federal departments and agencies are required to cooperate with and assist the Commission in performing these functions and are required to furnish the Commission with such reports and information as it may require., 97242=The goal of the agency's outreach, education and technical assistance program is to encourage and facilitate voluntary compliance with the anti-discrimination laws by employers and employer groups in the private and federal sectors, and to increase knowledge about individual rights under the anti-discrimination laws among the employees, employee groups and the public. We are increasing resources in fiscal year 2004 to enhance our prevention initiatives., 116036=Agency management will review the options and recommendations of the NAPA and IG studies and complete detailed transition plans, resource requirements and estimated savings for the five-year period in fiscal year 2003. Full implementation of the plan in fiscal year 2004 will revitalize the agency and enable.us to more effectively and efficiently implement the President's Management Agenda the agency's new Five-Point Plan, and other key administration and EEOC initiatives., 72326=Table 7 shows hearings workload for fiscal year 2002 and estimates for fiscal year 2003 through 2004. We expect to continue making significant inroads into resolving our pending inventory of hearings cases and resolving more complaints at the hearings stage within 180 days., 88012=We anticipate that success with these measures and our continued efforts to review the federal sector program throughout fiscal years 2003 and 2004, as part of our workforce restructuring and strategic management of human capital initiatives, will result in better service to federal agencies and employees., 84250=In fiscal year 2002, we exceeded targets by closing 92.5% of the appellate cases that were already 500 days old or older at the start of fiscal year 2002. In addition, we closed 40.3% of the appellate cases within 180 days. It is important to address all segments of our inventory so that we will reduce our overall inventory by ensuring that no band of cases lags behind other groups of cases., 74059=The revised regulations similarly had a positive effect on the EEOC's appeals process. These changes achieved dramatic reductions in our appellate inventory in fiscal year 2001, reducing the inventory approximately 53% from a high in January 2000. The Commission's federal appellate program continued this impressive progress in fiscal year 2002 by reducing the appellate inventory to 4,809; a 36% reduction from the 7,536 appellate inventory at the end of fiscal year. Table 8 shows the agency's projected appeals workload for fiscal year 2004., 45290=The estimated workload for the private sector administrative charge process (excluding litigation) for fiscal year 2004 is shown in Table 5 on page 25. The distribution of the workload among the various statutes enforced by the agency is displayed in Table 6 on page 26., 2978=Table 10: FY 2004 Requested Resources for Strategic Goal 2, 42241=The EEOC will use a multifaceted approach to accomplish its mission-related enforcement activities. Workforce restructuring is critical to our future success. Once we receive recommendations in fiscal year 2003 from a study currently under way by the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), we will implement a broad effort to realign our work force and structure to create a more effective and efficient organization., 41293=Table 4: FY 2004 Requested Resources for Strategic Goal 1, 126514=Starting in fiscal year 2003 and continuing into fiscal year 2004, we have identified several areas we can focus on that will begin to strategically address some of the human capital issues. We have two measures that focus on linking our strategic goals and objectives to employee performance and to broaden the use of electronic distance-learning to improve employee knowledge and skills, while conserving current resources until the full benefits of workforce restructuring can be realized through fiscal year 2007., 74614=Table 8: Appeals Workload Projections for Fiscal Year 2004, 85325=As part of our oversight role, we will pilot a new, comprehensive review and assessment program in fiscal year 2004. We are responsible for ensuring that federal agencies maintain a strong equal employment opportunity environment and for providing leadership and coordination throughout the government. An oversight program of this type helps us identify problems and trends and implement strategies to address them., 4877=The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) requests a budget of $334,754,000 for fiscal year 2004. This request represents an overall increase of $14.3 million above the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2003 request. The increase includes $5 million for fiscal year 2004 to begin implementation of a vital five-year restructuring initiative, including $2 million for technology-related improvements, that will allow the agency to continue to realign functions and resources to serve the American public more efficiently. Also, $3.8 million is needed to update and modernize technology in other areas. The remaining $5.5 million will fund various adjustments to base; including increases in rent, the fiscal year 2004 pay raise, and to annualize fiscal year 2003 compensation and benefit costs., 127074=We are committed to competitive sourcing as part of the overall workforce restructuring plan and our FAIR Act submission. A study in the agency's finance and human resources' functions was completed in fiscal year 2002 and is being reviewed and consolidated into NAPA's workforce restructuring study. For fiscal year 2004, we will address the sourcing of a percentage of positions we have identified., 97709=Proactive Prevention is the first point of the agency's Five-Point Plan. The Plan expects us to build on our previous efforts and expand our proactive role to provide information and solutions that help identify and solve workplace problems before they escalate into intractable conflict. With more resources devoted to these efforts throughout fiscal year 2004, we will enhance our prevention role and encourage learning and understanding among employers and employees., 1654=Table 5: Private Sector Enforcement\u2013Workload Projections for Fiscal Year 2004, 51167=An effective litigation program facilitates the achievement of a number of interrelated goals. Litigation educates employers about their federal statutory responsibilities, deters employers from discriminating, eliminates discriminatory workplace policies and practices, and compensates victims of discrimination. We achieve these goals by building a litigation docket with geographic diversity to have a presence in different courts throughout the country, and with statutory diversity to address all of the laws, covered groups and issues. It is critical that we maintain a litigation program that is visible and diverse to be effective in redressing discrimination and motivating employers to avoid discriminatory practices in the first place. We expect to file 280 - 380 new lawsuits in fiscal year 2004., 22925=The EEOC serves as the lead agency in the coordination of federal agencies\u2019 enforcement of all federal statutes, Executive Orders, regulations, and policies requiring equal employment opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability. Since the issuance of Executive Order 12067 in 1978, the EEOC has exercised this responsibility in many different ways; coordinating and cooperating with key federal agencies responsible for areas of equal employment opportunity. The EEOC will continue to reinvigorate its leadership in this area as the lead federal civil rights agency for equal employment discrimination policy and programs., 70567=In the past few years, we have achieved significant progress in curbing the growth in the hearings inventory. We issued revised regulations in early fiscal year 2000, which continue to positively impact on the EEOC's workload in the hearings process by promoting consolidation and amendment of complaints and eliminating interlocutory appeals. The revisions made the hearings process more efficient and fair by reducing the number of hearings and avoiding fragmentation of claims. There was a 6.5% decrease in the number of hearings requested between fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001 and a 2% drop between fiscal years 2001 and 2002, as a result of these changes and in conjunction with our role requiring agencies to make alternative dispute resolution (ADR) available before a claim reaches the hearings stage., 21032=The President\u2019s New Freedom Initiative also emphasizes the importance of telework and technological innovation as vehicles for increasing the employment of people with disabilities. In fiscal years 2003 and 2004, EEOC expects to launch initiatives on both telework and technology as they relate to an employer\u2019s obligation to provide reasonable accommodation under the ADA., 319=February 2003, 71394=The revisions, however, expanded the scope of the legal claims and evidence presented at each hearing because multiple claims, previously addressed at separate hearings, were combined into one hearing. Also, as the scope of hearings expanded, there were increased legal actions that we had to address. Responsibilities for the administrative judges were increased, including the review of agency dismissals of portions of complaints, calculation of attorney fee awards, and evaluation and approval of settlement agreements in class cases. Finally, some cases that previously involved administrative judges but were easily settled are now settling at an earlier stage of the process because we have required federal agencies to offer ADR programs during their own complaint processing programs. However, even with these responsibilities increased in fiscal year 2002, we resolved 24% more hearings than in fiscal year 2001., 56657=During fiscal year 2002, we succeeded in resolving almost 66% of our private sector charges within 180 days of receipt. One hundred and eighty days is an important time frame for several reasons. First, the statutes EEOC enforces generally allow a charging party to proceed to file a lawsuit in federal court only after the EEOC has first had 180 days to investigate the charge. Second, parties generally view 180 days as a reasonable time to wait for a resolution. Finally, the various steps required to investigate a charge, especially if mediation is unsuccessful, consumes most of this 180-day period., 60935=Finally, in fiscal year 2003, we will continue to expand the number of private employers that participate in mediation by entering into Universal Agreements to Mediate. The agreements allow the EEOC to attempt mediation in all cases involving the employer, as long as the charging party consents. In fiscal year 2004, we will further expand this effort by a 25% increase in the number of employers signing these Agreements., 150191=The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was established by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 253, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) as amended, and became operational on July 2, 1965. The Commission has five members, no more than three of whom shall be of the same political party. The members are appointed by the President, by and with the consent of the Senate, for rotating 5-year terms. The President designates one member to serve as Chairman and one member to serve as Vice Chairman. The General Counsel is also appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term of 4 years., 60581=The current measure emphasizes class cases that are successfully litigated. In fiscal year 2004, we expect to successfully litigate a total of 70 class cases, representing 75% of the class cases completed in that fiscal year. This measure focuses the agency on a more results-oriented basis for describing the success of our litigation program., 51985=During fiscal year 2004, we will shift resources to coordinate our prevention and enforcement activities. This shift will allow us to focus on the important proactive prevention efforts anticipated in the Five-Point Plan. We anticipate 3,000 more charges in the inventory by the end of fiscal year 2004 than at the end of fiscal year 2003. As we begin realizing significant savings and program efficiencies from the restructuring efforts, however, we will refine the out-year workload projections. For litigation, we will strategically identify new litigation and maintain a litigation docket to ensure the effective enforcement of the statutes we enforce., 11435=Since the start of fiscal year 2002, EEOC has focused on five key initiatives that form the basis of this performance budget. In fiscal year 2004, we will build on our earlier successes and continue to integrate all five initiatives into a single cohesive approach. The five initiatives are:, 93612=Our collaborative efforts have helped advance equal employment opportunity nationwide. We will continue contractual and technical assistance efforts with the FEPAs and the TEROs. Table 9 summarizes the State and Local Program's actual workload and results for fiscal year 2002 and estimated workload results for fiscal years 2003 through 2004., 155738=This page was last modified on July 29, 2003, 137379=The EEOC offers specialized and in-depth training services through its Revolving Fund. In 1992, Congress passed the EEOC Education, Technical Assistance and Training Revolving Fund Act (P.L. 102-411). Under the Act, we develop and deliver comprehensive and specialized external education, technical assistance and training relating to the laws we enforce. This authority permits us to charge a fee for the costs associated with the delivery of Revolving Fund programs. Programs offered through the Revolving Fund augment agency activities that are provided to the public free of charge., 6818=While our nation has made much progress over the past four decades, many new and continuing challenges still lie ahead. EEOC continues to receive large numbers of discrimination charges, with age and disability discrimination representing the two fastest growing areas of discrimination since fiscal year 2000. The American workforce is aging quickly as the Baby Boom generation approaches retirement. At the same time, better health and longer lives are redefining the attitudes and expectations of older Americans toward work and retirement. Research shows that 80 percent of Baby Boomers plan to work at least part-time during their retirement years.1 A workforce with a larger percentage of older workers poses new workplace challenges, as we already have begun to see in the complex area of employee benefits. A struggling economy \u2013 combined with a global economic environment where corporate mergers, restructuring, and downsizing are commonplace \u2013 has also brought more older workers to our doors., 105384=We conduct outreach, education and technical assistance activities aimed at two primary groups\u2013employers and employees and their respective advocacy organizations. Previously, we used various proxies of results-based performance measures to assess the success of these prevention programs. In fiscal year 2004, we will begin to refine our performance measurement tools; aiming to more directly measure how well our information and guidance are used by participants attending our events., 72610=Table 7: Hearings Workload Projections for Fiscal Year 2004, 29925=Fiscal Year 2004 (Dollars in thousands*), 129548=The following five performance measures for fiscal year 2004 will enhance our effectiveness in the three strategic objectives under Strategic Goal 3. These measures represent a step towards more effective, results-based performance tied to agency resources., 27968=Note: A regular 2003 appropriation for this account had not been enacted at the time the budget was prepared; therefore, this account is operating under a continuing resolution (P.L. 107-229, as amended). The amounts included for 2003 in this budget reflect the Administration\u2019s 2003 policy proposals., 9022=These are just two of many trends we have begun to see, and we expect they will continue into fiscal year 2004 and beyond. Yet, these trends are just some of the challenges EEOC faces. Today\u2019s emerging workplace issues are vastly different from those of a decade ago. Technological advancements, unprecedented economic growth, the globalization of world markets and profound demographic shifts are reshaping the American workplace. The workforce is more mobile than ever before, with more contingent and alternative work arrangements than just a few years ago. Employers and employees are negotiating complex issues like talent shortages, greater competition for talent, and family friendly work programs., 40355=This fiscal year 2004 performance budget begins to identify and collect funding information and align costs with strategic goals in the agency's effort to implement the President's Management Agenda for budget and performance integration. Over the next few years, we will substantially improve our capability to identify and collect cost information at a greater degree of detail and to link these costs to specific goals and measures., 2142=Table 7: Hearings Workload Projections for Fiscal Year 2004, 154642=On July 26, 1990, the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) became law. The ADA became effective on July 26, 1992, for employers with 25 or more employees and on July 26, 1994, for employers with 15 -24 employees. This legislation provides a clear and comprehensive mandate for enforcing the laws prohibiting discrimination in employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. EEOC is responsible for ensuring compliance with Title I of this statute and in coordination with the Attorney General, for providing technical assistance to those with rights and responsibilities under the Act., 92717=The Commission's fiscal year 2004 request includes $30.0 million for the State and Local Program. The Commission has developed strong partnerships with the many state and local Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs) and Native-American Tribal Employment Rights Organizations (TEROs). Our work-sharing agreements and other activities have benefitted the employer and employee communities by coordinating charges dual-filed under state or local law and federal law, where appropriate; by providing training on investigative and legal issues; and, by conducting joint activities, such as outreach. For example, in fiscal year 2002, we contracted with 91 FEPAs to resolve dual-filed charges. This arrangement prevents duplication of effort and streamlines the charge resolution process. We also contracted with 64 TEROs to promote employment opportunity on or near Indian reservations., 17003=Finally, we will design a model ADR program to handle our own workplace disputes, which will be piloted in fiscal year 2003 and implemented in fiscal year 2004., 45570=Table 5: Private Sector Enforcement\u2013Workload Projections for Fiscal Year 2004, 152443=EEOC also enforces the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967, and the Equal Pay Act (EPA). The ADEA protects workers age 40 and older from discrimination in hiring, discharge, pay, promotions, fringe benefits, and other aspects of employment by employers having 20 or more employees. The Equal Pay Act prohibits gender-based discrimination in the payment of wages to men and women performing substantially equal work in the same establishment. The Commission receives and investigates charges of discrimination in these areas and makes findings of \"violation\" or \"no violation\" and may file suit in Federal District Court if it is unable to achieve voluntary resolution of violations through conciliation., 137975=During fiscal year 2002, we conducted 426 fee-based training events under the auspices of the Revolving Fund, attended by more than 24,000 persons. During fiscal year 2004, as in prior years, we will continue to provide a wide variety of high quality Technical Assistance Program Seminars (TAPS), primarily one day in length for private and federal employers in diverse geographical locations around the country. Also, we will continue to schedule numerous one day to one week courses on equal employment opportunity (EEO) counseling, investigations and other topics for federal employees nationally. In fiscal year 2004, we estimate that we will conduct at least 480 Revolving Fund activities, including 55 TAPS events, for private and federal sector employers., 20708=In August 2002, EEOC produced a practical, reader-friendly handbook outlining the employment provisions of the ADA as they relate to both employees and job applicants. The handbook \u2013 entitled The Americans with Disabilities Act: A Primer for Small Business \u2013 has been well received and is in heavy demand., 15114=Promoting and expanding mediation and other types of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is the centerpiece of the EEOC\u2019s Five-Point Plan. Our private sector mediation program has demonstrated that disputes can be settled quickly, amicably and cost-effectively through ADR techniques. At the end of fiscal year 2002, the average time to mediate a charge was only 82 days, while the average closure time for all other charges was more than twice as long \u2013 171 days., 21456=Chair Cari M. Dominguez launched EEOC\u2019s Freedom to Compete Initiative in 2001. The essence of the Initiative is simple. By advancing free marketplace principles, corporate America led our nation to its present position of global economic preeminence. Our laws, our citizens, and our economy now demand that those same principles that worked so well in the marketplace be applied in the workplace., 128097=We have implemented a process to bring budgeting and performance elements together. We will implement a new GPRA Strategic Plan on October 1, 2003, and will cover the implementation of this fiscal year 2004 performance budget. We are also reevaluating our planning approaches to design more results-based performance measures in the future. For this fiscal year 2004 budget request and annual performance plan, we have initiated this approach and focused on better measures to assess the results of our programs and accomplishments. Finally, for the first time we have tied funding to specific goals in our GPRA Strategic Plan. In the next few years, we will allocate funding at more detailed levels to enhance our budget and performance integration effort under the PMA., 19588=In 2001, President Bush launched the New Freedom Initiative (NFI) \u2013 a comprehensive strategy for achieving full integration of individuals with disabilities into all aspects of the nation\u2019s social and economic life. Access to employment is one critical aspect of full integration. As the law enforcement agency responsible for enforcing the employment title of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), EEOC continues to work closely with other federal agencies and the White House to implement the NFI in the workplace., 86249=Finally, we must ensure that our own internal equal employment opportunity process is effective and efficient, as a federal agency itself and as a model employer. Several measures address the complaint process for our own employees in an effort to measure and improve the timeliness of internal investigations and hearings. In addition to making the EEOC a model employer, another goal of the agency's Five-Point Plan is to ensure Proficient Resolution, which includes the resolution of complaints of employment discrimination raised by EEOC employees. We exceeded our target by issuing a hearings determination within 180 days or less in all of the cases where hearings were requested on or after February 1, 2002. We only issued investigative reports within 180 days in 29% of the complaints filed on or after February 1st, however. The predominant reason was a shift in focus within the agency's EEO office to complete investigations on the older inventory first, while proceeding to process some of the newer cases within the 180 day time frame. We completed approximately 88% of the investigations of these older cases. We will close the remaining aging inventory throughout fiscal year 2003 and anticipate achieving the target for closing all investigations within 180 days during fiscal year 2004., 87563=In addition to the two measures assessing performance for the investigations and hearings processes, we are committed to resolving disputes at the earliest possible time to enable federal sector employers and employees to create a discrimination-free workplace. Our new fiscal year 2004 measure highlights this commitment by expecting a large proportion of our own employees to elect an alternative mechanism to resolve workplace disputes., 20128=To date, our NFI activities have focused primarily on small business. In 2002, EEOC began partnering with local Chambers of Commerce and business and disability groups across the country to provide free workshops to small employers on the ADA. The workshops offered small employers an overview of the ADA, practical advice on how to comply, and information on the advantages of employing individuals with disabilities. Nearly forty-five workshops took place or were in development in FY 2002. EEOC expects to continue the workshops throughout fiscal years 2003 and 2004., 114636=We intend to design our five-year restructuring plan during fiscal year 2003.The $5 million will be dedicated to anticipated resource needs to carry out management decisions resulting from the NAPA and IG studies. We anticipate resource requirements to support the full range of staffing adjustments, including retirement counseling, lump sum payments, pay adjustments, training, permanent change of duty station and transition assistance. The request also includes estimated funds to establish a national call center to begin to relocate and downsize offices as we expand our telecommuting workforce. Finally, the request includes funds to improve our information technology network infrastructure targeted to the increase in the number of employees working from mobile locations., 115427=As part of our strategic human capital efforts, maintaining a productive and motivated workforce, compels us to continue a promotion and reward program to retain and maintain a productive and motivated workforce. More costly rent at many agency offices has placed additional strains on the agency's budget. For example, we experienced a doubling of the annual rent cost when we had to replace our New York District Office in fiscal year 2002 after the terrorist attack. The requested increase will allow us to begin restructuring the agency and achieving much needed reductions in operational costs., 15587=We will build on earlier successes through the continued development of a comprehensive agency-wide ADR program. We have expanded the pool of private sector charges eligible for mediation and now offer mediation at other stages of the private sector charge process. We also will work to expand the number of private employers participating in Universal Agreements to Mediate, which allow EEOC to attempt mediation in all appropriate cases involving an employer so long as the charging party and employer consent. Finally, we will evaluate two innovative mediation programs piloted in fiscal year 2003. One program suspends the processing of a charge in order to allow a charging party to use an employersponsored ADR program to try and resolve the dispute. The other program involves partnering with state and local Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPA) with established programs to mediate charges for EEOC on a contract basis., 144711=We have also implemented several new data systems that enhance our budget and performance integration efforts. A new personnel system was implemented in September 2001 to provide more accurate information on our employees and provide enhanced technological capabilities for utilizing this information. The Federal Personnel/Payroll System (FPPS) is maintained by the Department of Interior's National Business Center. We also implemented our new, Integrated Financial Management System in October 2001. The system is also operated and maintained by the Department of the Interior National Business Center. It has core accounting, budget execution and project cost accounting modules. This system provides centralized access to a single, integrated corporate-wide financial database and provides a mechanism for consolidated financial reporting. Two additional modules, procurement (IDEAS) and fixed assets/property accounting, were implemented in fiscal year 2002. A third module, travel management, will be operational at pilot locations during FY 2002 and implemented nationwide in FY 2003., 99731=Table 10: FY 2004 Requested Resources for Strategic Goal 2, 96794=We will use a significantly different type of performance measure for fiscal year 2004 to describe results in our State and Local Program. By attempting to reduce the average processing time of FEPA dual-filed charges, we and our FEPA partners will provide more timely service to the employer and employee customers we both serve., 133501=The indicator for this measure is revised from the statement used in our fiscal years 2002 and 2003 GPRA Annual Performance Plans to simplify the terminology and more accurately identify the results expected. The purpose for the measure has not changed, because the agency is still expected to achieve positive results by paying vendors more efficiently., 1423=Table 4: FY 2004 Requested Resources for Strategic Goal 1, 119770=The requested additional technology funds in fiscal year 2004 will support the implementation and continuation of several vital agency technology initiatives:, 42981=In addition to the overall agency restructuring endeavor, we are reviewing the federal sector program. Federal employees and agencies labor under an equal employment opportunity system that is overburdened, time-consuming, and costly. We will work with constituency groups and within the Administration throughout fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to meet the important challenge of improving the effectiveness of the federal sector program., 145813=Finally, during fiscal year 2002, we drafted our Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility and Integrity of Information Disseminated by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The guidelines become effective on October 1, 2002. They describe the EEOC's policy and procedures for reviewing and substantiating the quality of information and data before it is disseminated to the public. They also provide an administrative mechanism for individuals to seek and obtain correction of the disseminated information., 43425=We are also enhancing our partnership with the FEPAs and TEROs to improve service at the front-line for employee and employer customers. Our work sharing agreements with FEPAs are an important element for providing improved service. For the first time, a measure is included in the performance plan for fiscal year 2004 to reduce the average processing time for charges investigated by FEPAs., 27053=For necessary expenses of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as authorized by title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (29 U.S.C. 206(d) and 621-634), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991, including services as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 3109; hire of passenger motor vehicles as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 1343(b); non-monetary awards to private citizens; and not to exceed $30,000,000 for payments to State and local enforcement agencies for services to the Commission pursuant to title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, sections 6 and 14 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991, $334,754,000: Provided, That the Commission is authorized to make available for official reception and representation expenses not to exceed $2,500 from available funds., 140363=For fiscal year 2004, we will shift our focus from measuring performance of the Revolving Fund by counting the number of events and the number of attendees to a more results-based approach in conjunction with a new and similar measure for non-fee based outreach, education and technical assistance programs (See Strategic Goal 2 GPRA performance measures, page 51). The performance measure focuses on the critical aspect of the activities conducted by our outreach efforts\u2013the way attendees to our events use the information they receive in a workplace setting. We intend to explore this aspect of our efforts in fiscal year 2004 for the first time. Since the Revolving Fund activities are a vital part of our overall outreach, education and technical assistance efforts, this performance measure is included under the prevention goal\u2013Strategic Goal 2., 57858=Although we are currently exceeding our 60% target value for this measure, we are balancing our resources to also pursue several other important initiatives, especially the enhancement of our prevention activities under Strategic Goal 2. Over several years, we sharply reduced our inventory of charges. As we seek a balance between our enforcement and prevention efforts, the current percentage reflects what we believe to be an optimum number of charges that can be reasonably processed within the time frame. Also, a significant portion of the charges can take much longer than 180 days to complete because of the merits of the allegations raised. Finally, in fiscal year 2002, we implemented a plan to address the oldest charges and reduce the overall age of the agency's inventory., 98799=We will broaden our efforts to build an understanding with employers and employees about employment rights and responsibilities and become informed about the changing diversity in the workplace. The Introduction to this performance budget described many types of wide-ranging activities we are engaged in, and will increase in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, to identify and work with groups needing information and assistance. As more resources are shifted to this function in fiscal year 2004, we can develop and implement many different programs and initiatives to enhance this work., 113858=Our fiscal year 2004 budget request includes $5 million above the agency's base to cover the cost of workforce restructuring. In April 2002, we contracted with the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) for a study to assess our structure and workforce issues. The NAPA will provide options, recommendations and a five-year implementation plan to restructure the agency. Concurrent with the NAPA study, the agency's Inspector General (IG) began an assessment of telecommuting options and the feasibility of substantially expanding the program to reduce overhead costs; predominantly rent. The NAPA and IG studies are critical to the agency's future. Recommendations from these two studies will guide the development of our workforce restructuring initiative., 124892=The President's Management Agenda (PMA) consists of five areas designed to address critical management issues in the federal government and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of agencies to deliver services to the American public. The five areas are: Strategic Management of Human Capital, Competitive Sourcing, Improved Financial Performance, Expanded Electronic Government and Budget and Performance Integration. A key focus for the agency in Strategic Goal 3 is the implementation of programs to address all of these areas. Some of these programs have been initiated in fiscal year 2002 and will continue to build throughout fiscal year 2003 into fiscal year 2004. The studies already underway by the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) and the EEOC's Office of Inspector General (IG) will be critical components of agency plans to revitalize us, making us more effective and efficient., 38280=Our staff accomplishes a vast array of enforcement activities in 51 field offices nationwide and our headquarters operation in Washington, D.C. For example, in the private sector program, numerous charging parties are counseled about procedures for filing a charge of employment discrimination. Over 80,000 private sector charges alleging employment discrimination are received each year. Over 95,000 charges (fiscal year 2002 data) are resolved in mediation or settlement; in conciliation after our finding of reasonable cause to believe that discrimination occurred; by dismissal because we found no reasonable cause to believe that discrimination occurred, or we administratively closed the charge. From fiscal year 1996 to the present, litigation was filed in 167-439 cases each year, with between 550-890 cases in litigation during the year., 101918=A significant emerging issue during fiscal year 2002 was the backlash against Muslims, Arabs, Sikhs, and other members of the Middle Eastern and South Asian communities post-September 11th. We responded to this through field outreach efforts, new brochures, translation of existing brochures, and a Commission meeting. We anticipate increased monitoring and charge processing to continue. These are the kinds of new developments that we must stand ready to address., 66033=We are currently reviewing the entire federal sector program to improve its effectiveness and efficiency. The time it has taken to process a hearing or appeal has been substantially reduced by our diligence in improving the program, including significant changes to the regulations in fiscal year 2000. Nevertheless, the federal sector program does not provide the effective and efficient service federal employees deserve. Costs are excessive to complainants, agencies, and taxpayers. In addition, we believe that the current system is not designed to achieve a resolution of employment discrimination allegations in a way that would improve working relationships and effectively remove employment discrimination in the workplace., 2275=Table 8: Appeals Workload Projections for Fiscal Year 2004, 147149=We will continue to build on the guidelines throughout fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to ensure the quality, usefulness, objectivity and integrity of our information and our ability to verify and validate our information and data., 5681=In fiscal years 2003 and 2004, the agency will continue to strengthen the links between budget and performance as required by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA). In support of the President\u2019s Management Agenda we have aligned our budget request with our strategic plan, and funding that was previously included under the activity \u201cExecutive Direction and Support\u201d has been allocated to the agency\u2019s first two strategic goals., 127527=The most important financial criterion for this area of the PMA is an unqualified opinion on the agency's financial audit. We are committed to receiving this opinion in fiscal year 2004 for our fiscal year 2003 financial statements., 106940=Our third measure (2.\u2014.2.) is also new for fiscal year 2004. We want to encourage more respondents in our private sector charge process to participate in our highly successful mediation program. The participation rate over the past several years has remained relatively constant. Approximately 29-32% of the respondents offered an opportunity to mediate elect to participate. We want to dramatically increase that percentage and will conduct a survey in fiscal year 2003 to gain insights into barriers that we can address in fiscal year 2004 with a target to increase the respondent participate rate to 40%.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Table 8: Appeals Workload Projections for Fiscal Year 2004 The revised regulations similarly had a positive effect on the EEOC's appeals process. These changes achieved dramatic reductions in our appellate inventory in fiscal year 2001, reducing the inventory approximately 53% from a high in January 2000. The Commission's federal appellate program continued this impressive progress in fiscal year 2002 by reducing the appellate inventory to 4,809; a 36% reduction from the 7,536 appellate inventory at the end of fiscal year.
