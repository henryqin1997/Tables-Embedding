By Niyantha Shekar TCM July issue, 72942=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 50918=Adam Wheater developed through the Essex academy and Millfield School into an impressive wicketkeeper-batsman. He represented England Under-19s and found a place in Essex's Championship side in 2011 but quickly found his development blocked by James Foster and bought himself out of his contract at Essex to move to Hampshire for the 2013 season., 34124=Born February 13, 1990, Whipps Cross Hospital, London, 76708=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 55633=Jun 8, 2015, 51868=The trend continued for a while in 2014 but Bates couldn't take his chance with the bat, despite improvement, as Wheater eventually took over behind the stumps. He contributed 610 runs at 32.10 to Hampshire's promotion-winning campaign. He also made his maiden List A century from just 76 balls on his way to 135 - ironically against Essex at Chelmsford., 51370=Wheater caught Hampshire's attention in July 2012 when he made 98 off 111 balls to very nearly pull off a chase of 360 for Essex at Chelmsford in the Championship. A year later and he was playing for Hampshire and made three first-class centuries in his first season. But Wheater's glovework came under much scrutiny because of Michael Bates - one of the most talented wicketkeepers in the country - and Wheater ended the season playing only as a batsman., 52265=Wheater spent the winter of 2010-11 playing for Matabeleland Tuskers in Zimbabwe where he made a century and four fifties. That summer came his chance for Essex where he averaged 42.31, including 164 against Northants. Runs flowed again a year later before his move south. ESPNcricinfo staff}",
