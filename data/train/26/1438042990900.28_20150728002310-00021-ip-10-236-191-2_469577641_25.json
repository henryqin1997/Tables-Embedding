In this test, a 0.1 wt % solution of the surfactant is added from an elevated foam pipette to a foam receiver containing the same solution. The foam height is measured at the completion of the addition (\u201cInitial Foam Height\u201d) and the time required for the foam to dissipate is recorded (\u201cTime to 0 Foam\u201d). This test provides a comparison between the foaming characteristics of various surfactant solutions. In general, in photoresist developers, coatings, inks, and agricultural formulations, foam is undesirable because is complicates handling and can lead to coating and print defects, and to inefficient application of agricultural materials.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{125908=[0107] In the following Examples dynamic surface tension data were obtained for aqueous solutions of various compounds using the maximum bubble pressure method at bubble rates from 0.1 bubbles/second (b/s) to 20 b/s. The maximum bubble pressure method of measuring surface tension is described in Langmuir 1986, 2, 428-432. These data provide information about the performance of a surfactant at conditions from near-equilibrium (0.1 b/s) through extremely high surface creation rates (20 b/s). In practical terms, high bubble rates correspond to high printing speeds in lithographic printing, high spray or roller velocities in coating applications, and rapid application rates for agricultural products., 113021=[0104] A 1000 mL autoclave was charged with the 1.3 mole ethylene oxide adduct of 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol (313 g, 1.1 moles; Surfynol 104 surfactant from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.) which had previously been dried by heating under vacuum. The reactor was sealed and pressure checked, the air was removed with three nitrogen pressure-vent cycles. The reactor was pressured to 100 psig (6.7 bar) with nitrogen, and the contents were heated to 40\ufffd C. BF3 diethyl etherate (1.3 g) was added and ethylene oxide and propylene oxide were added simultaneously at rates of 91.05 mL/h and 68.95 mL/h, respectively, by means of two syringe pumps. The total amount of ethylene oxide (180 g, 204 mL, 4.08 moles) and propylene oxide (128 g, 155 mL, 2.2 moles) were such that the final mole ratio of diol:EO:PO was 1:5:2. After the completion of the addition, an additional 0.7 g of BF3 diethyl etherate was added, whereupon an exotherm to 45.5\ufffd C. was observed. At this point gas chromatographic analysis indicated that the reaction was complete. The product (Example 6) was analyzed by NMR and MALD/I and found to have a structure consistent with the desired structure., 38124=[0009] Efficient application of agricultural products is also highly dependent on the dynamic surface tension properties of the formulation. In an article, Wirth, W.; Storp, S.; Jacobsen, W. \u201cMechanisms Controlling Leaf Retention of Agricultural Spray Solutions\u201d; Pestic. Sci. 1991, 33, 411-420, the relationship between the dynamic surface tension of agricultural formulations and the ability of these formulations to be retained on a leaf was studied. These workers observed a good correlation between retention values and dynamic surface tension, with more effective retention of formulations exhibiting low dynamic surface tension., 62062=[0050] It is desirable that an aqueous solution of the alkoxylated acetylenic diol demonstrates a dynamic surface tension of less than 35 dynes/cm at a concentration of \u22660.5 wt % in water at 23\ufffd C. and 1 bubble/second according to the maximum-bubble pressure method. The maximum-bubble-pressure method of measuring surface tension is described in Langmuir 1986, 2, 428-432, which is incorporated by reference., 38811=[0010] Low dynamic surface tension is also important in high-speed printing as discussed in the article \u201cUsing Surfactants to Formulate VOC Compliant Waterbased Inks\u201d, Medina, S. W.; Sutovich, M. N. Am. Ink Maker 1994, 72 (2), 32-38. In this article, it is stated that equilibrium surface tensions (ESTs) are pertinent only to ink systems at rest. EST values, however, are not good indicators of performance in the dynamic, high speed printing environment under which the ink is used. Dynamic surface tension is a more appropriate property. This dynamic measurement is an indicator of the ability of the surfactant to migrate to a newly created ink/substrate interface to provide wetting during high-speed printing., 103536=[0095] A 1000 mL autoclave was charged with Surfynol\ufffd 465 surfactant (300 g, 0.45 moles) and dimethylethylamine (53.7 g, 0.73 moles). The reactor was sealed, purged free of air with three nitrogen pressure-vent cycles, then pressured to 100 psig (6.7 bar) with nitrogen and heated to 120\ufffd C. Propylene oxide (183 g, 3.15 moles) was added over a period of 70 minutes by means of a syringe pump. At the completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was heated for an additional 12 hr at 120\ufffd C. The reactor contents were cooled and discharged. The product was heated under vacuum to remove volatiles (unreacted PO and catalyst); 68 g of material were removed., 102057=[0093] The developer, or electronics cleaning, solutions in which use of the adduct of the invention is preferred are the aqueous solutions of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). These developers are also well known in the art. Commercial developers usually contain low levels of surfactant on the order of 50 to 1000 ppm by weight. Surfactant level should not exceed that required to achieve the desired surface tension of the solution. For example, surface tensions of about 40 to 45 dynes/cm would be appropriate for novolac-based photoresist resins. Advanced resins that often incorporate aliphatic groups might require a developer with lower surface tension to enhance wetting. One of the advantages of the surfactants of this invention is that suitable surface tensions can be obtained at lower levels than is required by other wetting agents. This in itself is a step toward solving the foaming problem in the manufacture of microcircuitry., 37305=[0008] Low dynamic surface tension is of great importance in the application of waterborne coatings. In an article, Schwartz, J. \u201cThe Importance of Low Dynamic Surface Tension in Waterborne Coatings\u201d, Journal of Coatings Technology, September 1992, there is a discussion of surface tension properties in waterborne coatings and a discussion of dynamic surface tension in such coatings. Equilibrium and dynamic surface tension were evaluated for several surface-active agents. It is pointed out that low dynamic surface tension is an important factor in achieving superior film formation in waterborne coatings. Dynamic coating application methods require surfactants with low dynamic surface tensions in order to prevent defects such as retraction, craters, and foam., 106113=[0100] A 1000 mL autoclave was charged with Surfynol\ufffd 440 surfactant (400 g, 1.05 moles) which had previously been dried by heating under nitrogen. The reactor was sealed and pressure checked, the air was removed with three nitrogen pressure-vent cycles, and trimethylamine (2.7 g, 0.5 wt % of final reaction mass) was added by means of a gas tight syringe. The reactor was pressured to 100 psig (6.7 bar) with nitrogen and heated to 100\ufffd C. whereupon propylene oxide (122 g, 147 mL, 2.10 moles) was added at a rate of 1.0 mL/min by means of a syringe pump. At the completion of the addition, the reactor contents were stirred at 100\ufffd C. for 14.5 hours. The reactor was cooled and the contents were discharged into a round bottomed flask and heated under vacuum (0.25 torr) at ambient temperature (ca. 23\ufffd C.) for 16 hours to remove the trimethylamine catalyst. The product was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. The data are summarized in Table 1 which shows acetylenic diol compositions prepared using trimethylamine catalysis., 205350=[0126] The S-104 ethoxylates were made using the 5.1 mole ethoxylate of 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol which was prepared by reaction of the starting diol with ethylene oxide in the presence of trimethylamine catalyst at 80\ufffd C. using conventional procedures. This 5.1 mole ethoxylate of S-104 was reacted with varying amounts of ethylene oxide using trimethylamine catalyst. A 1000 mL autoclave was charged with the 5.1 mole ethoxylate (210 g, 0.47 moles) which had previously been dried by heating under nitrogen. The reactor was sealed and pressure checked, the air was removed with three nitrogen pressure-vent cycles, and trimethylamine (1.2 g) was added by means of a gas tight syringe. The reactor was pressured to 100 psig (6.7 bar) with nitrogen and heated to 100\ufffd C. whereupon ethylene oxide (8.2 g, 9.3 mL, 0.19 moles) was added at a rate of 1 mL/min by means of a syringe pump. At the completion of the addition, the reactor contents were stirred at 100\ufffd C. for 4 hours. The reactor was sampled to obtain an aliquot of the 5.5 mole ethoxylate of 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol. Higher ethoxylates were prepared by adding sufficient ethylene oxide to prepare the 6.5, 7.1, 15, 17, and 25 mole ethoxylates of 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol. Samples of each ethoxylate were removed from the reactor and characterized by matrix assisted laser-desorption/ionization (MALD/I) analysis., 32240=[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/477,600 filed Jan. 4, 2000 which is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. patent applications Ser. No. 09/304,607 and Ser. No. 09/304,612, both filed May 4, 1999, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference., 76266=[0076] To prepare the EO/PO adducts of the invention, the acetylenic glycol is liquefied by melting and the catalyst is added with stirring. Ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide are added as liquids with stirring and the reaction is concluded when the desired polyalkylene oxide chain length is reached as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), cloud point (ASTM D2024-65) or water titration of an isopropyl alcohol solution. No solvents are necessary during the reaction, but inert solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene) and ethers (ethyl ether) may be used to facilitate handling. In some instances it may be convenient to use a low mole ethoxylated acetylenic diol, since these products are liquids and are therefore easy to handle., 39585=[0011] Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) is the chemical of choice in aqueous alkaline solutions for developing photoresists according to Microlithography, Science and Technology, edited by J. R. Sheats and B. W. Smith, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1998, pp 551-553. Surfactants are added to the aqueous TMAH solutions to reduce development time and scumming and to improve surface wetting., 79807=[0081] The alkoxylated acetylenic diols are useful for the reduction of equilibrium and dynamic surface tension in water-based compositions containing an organic compound, particularly aqueous coating, ink, fountain solution, agricultural and electronics processing compositions containing organic compounds such as polymeric resins, macromolecules, organic bases, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides or plant growth modifying agents. It is desirable that an aqueous solution of the alkoxylated acetylenic diol demonstrates a dynamic surface tension of less than 35 dynes/cm at a concentration of \u22660.5 wt % in water at 23\ufffd C. and 1 bubble/second according to the maximum-bubble-pressure method. The maximum-bubble-pressure method of measuring surface tension is described in Langmuir 1986, 2, 428-432, which is incorporated by reference., 214973=[0128] The S-124 ethoxylates were made using the 4 mole ethoxylate of 2,5,8,11-tetramethyl-6-dodecyne-5,8-diol, which is commercially available as Dynol 604 surfactant from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. This 4 mole ethoxylate of S-124 was reacted with ethylene oxide using trimethylamine catalyst. A 1000 mL autoclave was charged with the 4.0 mole ethoxylate (195 g, 0.44 moles) which had previously been dried by heating under nitrogen. The reactor was sealed and pressure checked, the air was removed with three nitrogen pressure-vent cycles, and trimethylamine (1.2 g) was added by means of a gas tight syringe. The reactor was pressured to 100 psig (6.7 bar) with nitrogen and heated to 100\ufffd C. whereupon ethylene oxide (58.31 g, 66.1 mL, 1.32 moles) was added at a rate of 1 mL/min by means of a syringe pump. At the completion of the addition, the reactor contents were stirred at 100\ufffd C. for 4 hours. The reactor was sampled to obtain an aliquot of the 7.0 mole ethoxylate of 2,5,8,11-tetramethyl-6-dodecyne-5,8-diol. Higher ethoxylates were prepared by adding sufficient ethylene oxide to prepare the 15, 17, and 25 mole ethoxylates of 2,5,8,11-tetramethyl-6-dodecyne-5,8-diol. Samples of each ethoxylate were removed from the reactor and characterized by matrix assisted laser-desorption/ionization (MALD/I) analysis.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citada por [0141] The invention provides compositions suitable for reducing the equilibrium and dynamic surface tension in water-based coating, ink, fountain solution, agricultural, and photoresist developer/electronics cleaning compositions. STATEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION [0140] The family of surfactants disclosed in this invention provides an ability to control foam while providing excellent dynamic surface tension reduction. They will therefore have utility in applications such as coatings, inks, adhesives, fountain solutions, agricultural compositions, soaps and detergents. Their use in photoresist developer/-electronics cleaning compositions is especially advantageous. [0139] In sum, the ability of a surfactant to reduce surface tension under both equilibrium and dynamic conditions is of great importance in the performance of waterbased coatings, inks, adhesives, fountain solutions, agricultural compositions, and photoresist developers. Low dynamic surface tension results in enhanced wetting and spreading under the dynamic conditions of application, resulting in more efficient use of the compositions and fewer defects. Foam control is also an important attribute in many applications, but particularly so in photoresist developer, or electronics cleaning compositions. [0138] The above data in Table 15 show that low foam is achieved with the ethoxylated-propoxylated adduct. It is quite surprising that partial propoxylation of acetylenic alcohols which are also ethoxylated increases the ability of these adducts to reduce both surface tension and foaming tendency in TMAH developer solutions while maintaining good contrast for photoresist developing applications.",
