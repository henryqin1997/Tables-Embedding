These participants developed 22 key areas that affect highway safety. One of these areas is unsignalized intersection crashes., 63873=Engineers in Douglas and Otter Tail Counties provided installation data for STOP AHEAD pavement markings installed between 1998 and 2004. Although additional counties in the State have installed this strategy, they were not able to provide installation locations and dates. Otter Tail County provided the greatest number of sites (152) followed by Douglas County (12 sites). Of the 164 strategy locations provided by Otter Tail and Douglas Counties, 158 intersections were included in the evaluation. The primary motivation for selecting these 158 intersections was the availability of roadway and traffic volume data. When available, data on other strategies installed at the study locations were collected., 57926=The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) installed STOP AHEAD markings on State highway and intersecting local road approaches between 1999 and 2004 in response to past safety performance (i.e., number of crashes) or site-specific safety concerns (i.e., sight distance limitations due to vertical or horizontal curve). The supplemental pavement markings are an attempt to break the monotony of long stretches of road in order to indicate the presence of a STOP sign., 57411=The Traffic Safety Section of the AHTD Planning and Research Division provided crash data for the entire State from 1994 to 2004. There were several formatting changes to the crash data throughout the 11-year period. AHTD provided the necessary codebooks to interpret and adjust the data for the 11-year period. A radius of 76.25 m (250 ft) was used to identify crashes at the strategy and reference intersections., 62293=MDSHA provided crash data for all nine study locations and 60 reference site locations for the years 1996 through 2005 reported. Specific variables were requested to determine the details of each crash (e.g., crash type, severity, weather, etc.). Crashes that occurred on all approaches within 76.3 m (250 ft) of the intersection were included., 61225=The MDSHA Web site provided AADT data by year from 1988 to 2006 stratified by route number, mile number, and intersection description (e.g., intersection name or distance to intersection). Counts are not often available directly at an intersection. If the subject intersection was located between two count locations, an average of the two closest counts was computed. If the count location was relatively close to the subject intersection, the closest count was used. An annual growth factor was computed and applied to the traffic volumes to fill-in the AADT data for years that were not available., 112304=The most recent FHWA mean comprehensive cost per crash for unsignalized intersections(12) is $55,060 for an undefined collision based on 2001 dollar values. Comprehensive crash costs represent the present value, computed at a discount rate, of all costs over the victim's expected life span that result from a crash. The major categories of costs used in the calculation of comprehensive crash costs include medical-related costs, emergency services, property damage, lost productivity, and monetized quality-adjusted life years.(12) The value of an undefined crash is based on the comprehensive crash costs of various crash types and the proportion of each type of crash. The necessary savings to achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio would require a reduction in total crashes of 0.006 crashes per intersection-year for the latex application, assuming a TWSC with installations on both approaches. The corresponding number for the thermoplastic application is 0.027 crashes per intersection-year, assuming a TWSC installation. The necessary reductions per intersection-year would, however, change for an AWSC intersection because the pavement markings would be installed on all approaches. The necessary savings would now require a reduction of 0.011 total crashes per intersection-year for the latex application, while thermoplastic installations would require a reduction of 0.053 crashes per intersection-year. Based on the results in tables 7 through 9, it seems that the necessary reductions are easily achievable. The benefits will be less pronounced for intersections with relatively low crash rates. For example, the crash rate is 0.04 crashes per intersection-year for the Minnesota strategy sites in the before period (table 10). While there is a realized benefit after installing STOP AHEAD pavement markings, a reduction of 0.05 crashes per intersection-year is not possible to achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio for thermoplastic installations at AWSC locations., 6141=Form DOT F 1700.7 (8-72) Reproduction of completed pages authorized, 119190=Given the low-cost of this strategy, even with the conservative assumptions, a modest reduction in crashes is needed to justify their use. Based on the evidence provided by the estimated safety effectiveness of STOP AHEAD pavement markings, the necessary reduction to obtain a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio is easily achieved. Therefore, this strategy has the potential to reduce crashes cost-effectively, particularly at three-legged and AWSC intersections with a high crash frequency., 175200=This report was prepared by Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc (VHB) for the Federal Highway Administration, Office Safety under Contract DTFH61-05-D-00024. The current FHWA COTM for this project was Roya Amjadi. Kerry Perrillo Childress served as FHWA COTM from September 2005 until December 2006. Kimberly Eccles, P.E., of VHB was the study principal investigator. Dr. Frank Gross and Ramanujan Jagannathan, of VHB, conducted the analysis of the strategy and are the primary authors of the report. Dr. Bhagwant Persaud and Craig Lyon, subcontractors to VHB, developed the study design and provided general oversight of the analysis. Nancy X. Lefler of VHB led the data collection for the study and is a supporting author. Other significant contributions to the study were made by Dr. Hugh McGee, Dr. Forrest Council, Michelle Scism, Sean Kennedy, Bryon White, and Joseph Pospisil, all of VHB., 57064=Roadlog contains AADT for 2004. The AHTD Web site contains AADT data for 2005 and years prior to 2004. Annual growth factors were computed and used to add missing AADT data. AADT data were not available for some minor approaches; it was not possible to apply the growth factor in these cases., 111930=Based on the Office of Management and Budget, a discount rate of seven percent was used to determine the annual cost of the strategy. This resulted in an annual cost of $78 per approach for latex and $366 per approach for thermoplastic, which requires a $156 and $732 annual savings in crash costs per installation, respectively, to achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio., 20783=Given the low cost of this strategy, even with conservative assumptions, a modest reduction in crashes is needed to justify their use. Based on the estimated safety effectiveness of STOP AHEAD pavement markings, the necessary crash reduction to obtain a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio is easily achieved. Therefore, this strategy has the potential to reduce crashes cost effectively at stop-controlled intersections, particularly at three-legged and AWSC intersections., 21354=Intersections account for a small portion of the total highway system, yet in 2005, approximately 2.5 million intersection-related crashes occurred. Intersection crashes accounted for 41 percent of all reported crashes and 22 percent (8,655) of all fatal crashes in 2005.(1) The disproportionately high percentage of intersection crashes is not surprising because intersections present more points of conflict than non-intersection locations. Of the total intersection-related crashes, about 51 percent (1.27 million) occur at unsignalized intersections, of which 5,882 involve a fatality. This is compared to the 1.25 million crashes at signalized intersections, which includes 2,773 fatal crashes.(1)}",
    "textBeforeTable": "STUDY DESIGN The study design involved a sample size analysis and prescription of needed data elements. The sample size analysis assessed the size of sample required to statistically detect an expected change in safety and also determined what changes in safety can be detected with likely available sample sizes. Sample Size Overview Basic to estimating sample sizes are assumptions related to the expected safety effects and the crash frequency at STOP AHEAD sites in the before period. Minimum and desired sample sizes were calculated assuming a conventional before-after study with reference group, as described in Hauer,(7) and a literature review of likely crash rates. The sample size analysis undertaken for this study addresses the size of sample required to statistically detect an expected change in safety. The sample size estimates are conservative because the EB methodology is incorporated in the before-after analysis rather than applying a conventional before-after analysis with reference group. Sample sizes were estimated for various assumptions of likely safety effects and crash frequencies in the before period. Crash rates were assumed for three crash types (i.e., total, right-angle, and rear-end). As shown in table 1, a low (0.44 crashes/intersection/year), moderate (3.45 crashes/intersection/year), and high (7.62 crashes/intersection/year) crash rate for total crashes were assumed based on a variety of sources including previous studies, SafetyAnalyst,(8) and the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS).(9) It was then assumed that right-angle and rear-end collisions represent 39 percent and 23 percent of total crashes, respectively, based on data from",
