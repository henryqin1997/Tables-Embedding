The controller is configured to control operation of the electronic device. The unit section is drawable from a main body of the electronic device on which multiple loads and the controller are mounted. The unit section includes a first load, a second load, and a third load. Each of the first load and the second load is connected to a serial communication unit that enables serial communication with the control unit. The third load is connected to a communication line used for communication with the controller, without being connected to the serial communication unit. 20140307278 09-18-2014 POWER SUPPLY DEVICE, IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS, AND VOLTAGE OUTPUT METHOD - According to an aspect of the present invention, a power supply device includes: a DC power supply that outputs a DC voltage; an AC power supply that outputs any one of the DC voltage and a superimposed voltage being the DC voltage with an AC voltage superimposed thereon; and a bypass capacitor that charges a part of a voltage that is output from the AC power supply. The DC power supply starts outputting the DC voltage in a constant voltage mode and, when a predetermined condition is satisfied, switches from the constant voltage mode to a constant current mode to output the DC voltage in the constant current mode. 20140265552",
