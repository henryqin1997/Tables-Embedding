            "Youngstown State has their own police station. They have their opwn police cars. The campus police are everywhere and are heavily involved in ensuring that students are safe. Our police officers are here to protect the students and they do their job well.",
            "Greek life is big at Youngstown State. There is an annual Greek Sing competition every year and there are a ton of other Greek life activities throughout the year.",
            "There are clubs from environmental clubs, to the gay-straight alliance, to chemistry clubs, to theatre clubs, etc. If there isn't a club for someone, then that person can make one. There is guaranteed to be at least one or two other people interested in that activity.",
            "Any type of student can do well here. Youngstown State is an ethnically diverse college, as well as an educationally diverse college. People from all ages come to YSU and receive an excellent education.",
            "There is a rock on campus. The story behind it is this: There was some construction happening on campus when the workers discovered this huge boulder. Rather than get rid of it, the university decided to keep it. And now, the rock is painted at least two or three times a week, promoting student activities on campus or organizations. Just this year alone, one student proposed to his girlfriend by painting on the rock.",
            "The education offered at YSU is so affordable! You get the exact same education (if not a better one) offered by larger, more prestigious colleges for more than half the price.",
            "There are so many things to do on campus. Greek life, clubs, organizations. You name it, our campus probably has it. We have the Watson & Tressel training site and an amazing rec center, too.",
            "We have Arby's, Dunkin Donuts, five or six cafes, University Pizza, Jimmy John's, and more. There are so many places to go on campus to get great food at great prices. And Pete's Points (the meal plan at YSU) is taken at most locations.",
            "I don't live in a dorm because I live off-campus, but plenty of my friends on campus say that living in the dorms is amazing and so much fun.",
            "The general education requirements are typically your less difficult classes, but don't expect to pass if you don't show up or never turn anything in. Your professors want you to pass, but you have to help yourself, too.",
            "Get involved on campus, whether it be in an organization or through getting an on campus job. Be open to meeting new people and do activities. Study hard and go see your professors if you're struggling. Also, go to class because the teachers here are pretty amazing.",
            "Youngstown is a diverse campus with an exceptional amount of oppotunities to meet new people and explore different cultures. The campus is beautiful and there are over two thousand trees on campus, offering shade and a feeling of comfort. The teachers here really want their students to succeed and will help in any way they can, including offering one on one time and going above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that their students pass."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Youngstown State University is great for a number of different students. I am a part of their Education program and it is a very well organized program and the professors in it are very helpful and love what they are doing which makes class quite enjoyable. I recommend it for Education majors. Tips for prospective students Have fun. Get involved. You will get the most of your college experience by getting involved with clubs, organizations and even a job on campus. Take time from school to relax and enjoy yourself. Not only will you have fun but it will help you with school by controlling your stress. Don't be afraid to ask questions, either in class or outside of class. That's what professors are here for. Bang for the buck The programs here at YSU are very well put together. You can get the same education here as you can at a higher end college for a lot cheaper. Not only is it worth the money, but YSU also offers many different scholarships and awards plenty of financial aid to help you out. Their financial aid offices are a great help and will assist you with any problems you may have when it comes to paying for college. Am enjoying being",
