All day classes are cancelled. Then, this is totally optional, you climb up Tinker Mountain, which is a HIKE, in crazy costumes. Then at the top, you sing songs, put on skits, and eat fried chicken and picnic fare. This is just one really nice tradition. There are several more!, 122606=Tinker Day! In October, on a surprise weekday, everyone dresses up and skips class!, 100512=Because we're a small liberal arts school, we don't have a whole lot of sports, but we do have soccer, lacrosse, swimming, and volleyball, and a few other non-varsity sports. As for clubs, there are too many to list here, but there is at least one club for everyone. One such example, a club I participate actively in, is WA2, or Women Who Appreciate Anime. We meet every Friday and watch 2 hours of Japanese animation, bring different Japanese culture traditions to campus (kakurenbo, or hide in the seek in the dark; Maid Cafe, a maid-themed Japanese cafe; and others), and together with the specialty house Otaku Hall, put on a convention every January., 136169=While I was there, we had Sodexo as our food service provider. While the staff where great and friendly, the food choices were usually lacking. However, they are moving to a new group for the 2014/15 school year., 146734=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 80180=Hollins University is home to a plethora of unusual traditions, one of the most well known being Tinker Day. Tinker Day usually happens in the middle of the week. The church bells are rung around 5:30 am and all the students join in the cafeteria for donuts. Classes are then cancelled for the rest of the day as everyone dresses in incredibly ridiculous outfits and then hikes Tinker mountain, which is literally a mountain.}",
