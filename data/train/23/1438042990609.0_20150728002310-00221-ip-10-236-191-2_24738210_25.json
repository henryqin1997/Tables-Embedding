His play has been so impressive that he\u2019s pressing both Aaron Dobson and Boyce for playing time in the season opener., 126739=The New York Jets are hoping to turn their fortune around in 2013 with a much-improved offense. The only problem is they really didn\u2019t address the offense in this draft other than grabbing quarterback Geno Smith in the second round along with a few offensive linemen. Their real need is at the skill positions., 251777=Kenny Vaccaro reminds me a lot of a Troy Polamalu-type at safety. He recklessly throws his body around and loves getting in the mix of\u00a0a\u00a0scrum. So far he has lived up to expectations and he will need to play a pivotal role for the Saints defense in 2013., 306022=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Bleacher Report, Inc. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

Well, they certainly did that with the additions of Dion Jordan, Jamar Taylor, Will Davis and Jelani Jenkins., 261860=The Cardinals may have arguably the best draft class of 2013., 132866=Arthur Brown was drafted to fill the role of Dannell Ellerbe at the Will linebacker position. His sideline-to-sideline ability is among the best of the 2013 rookie crop, however, he has struggled to take on blocks and needs to get both stronger and more physical at the point of attack. This has been my concern with him coming out of college and it seems to be haunting him early on., 273696=San Francisco knew they could address their future in the 2013 draft which is exactly what they did when they picked up Tank Carradine and Marcus Lattimore., 121913=Linebacker Jamie Collins is one of my favorite players of the 2013 draft class. He has struggled a bit in pass coverage and whiffed on a few tackles, but don\u2019t underestimate this kid\u2019s enormous potential. He will eventually prove to be one of the most versatile and talented players on that defense.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports Carolina Panthers Next \u00bb 34 of 27 \u00ab Prev Overall Grade: C+ Keep an eye on undrafted free agent LB Paul Warrilow. This guy has been a tackling machine. Malliciah Goodman is a nice pickup in the fourth round who should be able to add some much-needed depth on the DL. His upside makes him a great value pick while also filling a big-time need for the Falcons. Many people believed cornerback Desmond Trufant was overrated; I was not one of those people. As it turns out, it appears I was wrong. But one of the benefits of \u201cdouble dipping\u201d in an area of need is that you increase your chances of finding the right guy. So far that guy appears to be Robert Alford. Overachieving undrafted free agents: LB Paul Worrilow (A).

    "textAfterTable": "The Panthers are looking extremely stout in the middle with rookies Star Lotulelei and Kawann Short plugging things up. Each of these players seems to have Pro Bowl potential and should make for a highly frustrating duo for years to come against opposing offenses. Rookie RB Kenjon Barner was supposed to be a big-time steal in the seventh-round, but so far he\u2019s played the part of underachiever. The Panthers still need help at the receiver position but at least they have some young pieces on defense to build upon.
