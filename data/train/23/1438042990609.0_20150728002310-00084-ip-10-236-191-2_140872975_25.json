It has a central place in the geography of the Na territory, and is one of the main symbolic places of Na/Mosuo culture. This legend tells how the Lake results from a flood caused by the greed of men. It also explains the origin of the boats traditionally used on the lake. Three versions of this story were recorded in 2006, 2007 and 2008; the speaker selected the third as the most satisfactory, hence the choice of this version for transcription. The fourth version is longer and more detailed., 13885=Dog (version 1)\u00a0 Date recorded: 2011., 29384=Na: a brief note Na: Fieldwork blog (Yongning 2006-2012)}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{135611=Transcriptions are provided both in a surface-phonological system using tone letters (\u02e5 for high, \u02e7 for mid, \u02e9 for low, \u02e9\u02e5 for low-to-high, \u02e7\u02e5 for mid-to-high) and in an abstract notation system set out in Michaud 2008.\u00a0, 97352=This set of recordings is the result of a systematic investigation into the tones of numeral-plus-classifier phrases in Na. These tone patterns are of some complexity: there exist 9 tonal categories of classifiers (2 subcategories for H, 2 for M, 2 for MH, and 3 for L), and some combinations allow two variants. (Before I understood that there were variants, I was led to believe that there must be as many as 11 categories, as reported in Michaud 2011 \u2013 an article which focused on structural similarities with two related languages, Naxi and Laze, and not on a detailed synchronic transcription.), 136990=A second set of data was elicited in 2006 using names of peoples (ethnic groups) and objects. Numerous peoples live in the area: Na (Mosuo), Prinmi (Pumi), Tibetan, Bai, Han (Chinese), Yi (Lolo), Lisu... Not all combinations refer to existing objects: for instance, not every group builds 'sanctuaries', /tse\u02e7k\u02b0o\u02e9/, on the mountains. As consultant F4 understood that the purpose was to explore linguistic combinations, not record random expressions, she agreed to record compounds which to her were unusual, e.g. \"Lisu knife\": the Lisu are not known for a specific type of knife, and so the phrase does not make sense in the same way as \"Lisu clothes\", which refers to something specific and familiar). At times she even agreed to record some combinations that are slightly shocking culturally, such as \"Lisu blood\". The artificial nature of the data goes some way towards explaining the tonal slips of the tongue that occasionally crept in: these are indicated with an asterisk * in the annotation., 60530=A striking omission is that of any account of the custom for which traditional Na society is famous among ethnologists: its family structure, whereby one stayed in one's mother's house all life long, and the father only had a very minor social role. As ethnologists who conduct research on this topic are well aware, investigations into the private lives of people can easily be intrusive. This is also a painful aspect of the confrontation between Na culture and (Han) Chinese\u00a0culture. In the 1970s the government cracked down heavily on the traditional Na family, cutting the grain supplies of people who did not adopt the Chinese-style family structure (\u4e00\u59bb\u4e00\u592b: 'one wife, one husband'). Today, these forbidden practises are advertised as part of the touristic attractiveness of the area of Yongning and lake Lugu, where mass tourism is developing at a staggering pace. The\u00a0amount of publicization of data about 'love among the Na/Mosuo',\u00a0and common misinterpretations of the facts, have created no small amount of resentment in the community. This is mentioned, for instance, in Shih Chuan-gang's 2010 book: Quest for Harmony: The Moso Traditions of Sexual Union and Family Life (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press; see especially pp. 132-134). Many anecdotes are told locally about people's strategies to deal with indiscreet questions, resorting to humorous inventions to protect their private lives while catering for the visitors' expectations. In this context, I could easily understand my consultants' choice not to broach this topic, and never tried to go against what I interpreted as a deliberate avoidance of this topic.\u00a0, 150277=The data from the Labai dialect presented here were collected in two work sessions with the distinguished writer Lamu Gatusa\u00a0\u62c9 \u6728\u2022\u560e \u5410\u8428\u00a0(Chinese pen-name: \u77f3\u9ad8\u5cf0), on August 11th and August 12th, 2009. The second session was recorded. For reasons of time, the narratives could not be transcribed. The only document with complete annotations is the word list. The purpose was to devise a transcription system in the International Phonetic Alphabet, which Mr. Lamu would then use (and develop further) for transcribing Na stories, proverbs and rituals and preparing annotated bilingual editions., 78040=A detailed account of the tonal grammar of Yongning Na is currently in preparation.\u00a0, 56067=After these two narratives had been transcribed, and as confidence built up over the years, more materials were recorded.\u00a0The way the collection of texts grew was the following: when one of the topics that came up in our conversations, or in one of the narratives already recorded, seemed to me to be interesting subject-matter for a recording, I would ask my teacher/consultant, F4, whether she could speak about it in a recording session. For instance, I mentioned to her a Laze story recorded in Muli, \"Buried Alive\". F4 remembered hearing a similar story from her grandmother, and agreed to record it (August 2011). A second version of this story was elicited (in February 2012) to improve the record: having different versions of the same story sometimes brings out variants that are useful in linguistic studies, e.g. full forms vs. reduced forms of certain morphemes. Midway through this second version, the narrator realized that the names given to the characters in this story happened to correspond with the names of some of her own family members. This she felt to be highly unappropriate, as it associates these real people with some characters involved in tangled family problems. The narrator changed the names at once (midway through the narrative) and completed the tale as best she could, with some hesitations and lapses back into the unappropriate set of names. After the recording was over, she decided that the story should be recorded anew, and a third version was produced in May 2012., 75287=A\u00a0recording was conducted in 2007 to illustrate (and verify) tonal oppositions between the tone categories of disyllables. This document, F4_TONE_NOUNSINFRAME_2007, essentially contains disyllabic nouns (about 300 tokens). The nouns are followed by the copula, /\u0272i\u02e9/, so as to bring out tones that are neutralized in isolation, and to illustrate the reassociation of the H portion of the MH# contour to the following syllable., 98461=Transcriptions are provided both in a surface-phonological system using tone letters (\u02e5 for high, \u02e7 for mid, \u02e9 for low, \u02e9\u02e5 for low-to-high, \u02e7\u02e5 for mid-to-high) and in an abstract notation system set out in Michaud 2008. A detailed account of these phenomena is in preparation., 125370=- Object and verb: some combinations recorded in 2007, a second set collected in 2009, and a supplement recorded in 2012., 58003=The first of the narratives (Sister: \"The Sister's Wedding\") was told in the presence of another speaker of Na: the narrator's son, Mr.\u00a0Latami Dashi. For the second story, I was the only audience, and this communicative situation, in which Mrs. Latami Dashilame only faced the microphone and the investigator, was repeated in all the following recording sessions. (An exception is BuriedAlive.3, which was recorded in 2012 in the presence of a team of journalists and of a fellow linguist, Ms. He Jiezhen.) As communicative acts, these narratives can therefore be seen as the consultant's response to a pressing demand on the part of an outsider wishing to learn about Na language and culture.\u00a0F4 goes by a simple principle: she will only tell about things she knows from having heard them in her youth, from elder members of the community, especially elder family members of her grandmother's and her mother's generations. When I narrated to her some tales which were reported in ethnographic reports to be part of the oral tradition in Yongning, she would indicate very clearly whether she was familiar with those or not, and it was very clear that she did not want to act as spokesperson for an abstract \"Na culture\" that did not correspond to her own experience. The stories that she does not have a command of include:, 69542=In 2012,\u00a0Xinhua Press reporters came to my home: they wanted to report about a foreigner working in Lijiang, and had heard about me from colleagues at the Dongba Research Institute. The consultant and I did our best to explain our work together. On that occasion, in front of the camera, as she had done when I recorded her \"informed consent\", she lay\u00a0emphasis on the linguist's achievements;\u00a0she had received instructions to this effect from family members, and would probably have adopted the same stance by herself, under\u00a0the pressure of answering official media. The report was considered drab and unattractive by the journalists' hierarchy, who had precise expectations on what they wanted to produce, and it was not publicized in the end, but the journalists sent me video excerpts, which will soon be available here. An interesting aspect of this brief video, to me, is that her answer to the journalists' questions was in Na.\u00a0, 157241=Full-text translations are available for all documents that have sentence-level translations. The text-level translations are intended to be legible, offering a convenient way of getting the gist of a story before beginning to decipher the original. News (July 2012): it is now possible to select the language of the full-text translation in the online interface. \u00a0, 57610=The \"Buried Alive\" story brought up the topic of ghosts. Later, I elicited some vocabulary in this semantic fields, and suggested making a recording of explanations about different types of ghosts. This resulted in a set of eight recordings about ghosts, spirits and vampires recorded in July 2012., 145877=On the other hand, the apical vowels [\u0285] and [\u027f] are phonemicized as /\u026f/. For details on the phonemic analysis, the reader is referred, again, to Michaud 2008., 134555=The\u00a0file Tone_BodyPartsOfAnimals_1to4_F4_2006 was created by assembling four files that had been recorded in succession (with pauses in-between each recording). The compounds are elicited in isolation; a few tokens are also pronounced with the existential /d\u0291o\u02e9/. Likewise, Tone_BodyPartsOfAnimals_8to10_F4_2008_withEGG was created by assembling three successive recordings., 130226=The earliest recordings (audio only), which date back to my first contact with the language, in 2006, are less complete because I was just beginning the process of sorting out how many tonal categories there were. The data are also less homogeneous because I asked for more repetitions when I needed confirmation; also, I tried various frames. These data are nonetheless provided too, as extra confirmation for the tone patterns that I report, and also because\u00a0some items are pronounced with extreme care, in order to teach me the correct patterns at a stage when I had no proficiency in the language at all, so they can be useful for someone who wants to go through the same process of becoming familiar with the language., 55206=Throughout the course of collaboration with language consultant F4, from 2006 to 2012, I was keen to collect new narratives, especially folk stories and tales about Na society in the old times: times which the speaker did not experience herself, but knew about from living with witnesses of the times that preceded the demise of the Yongning feudal lord and the direct integration of Yongning under Chinese administration. She was initially reluctant to record narratives, considering that, on the one hand, she did not have the authority or talent to do so, and on the other hand, she was wary of possible misinterpretations and misuses of the recorded data. She nonetheless accepted to record two narratives:\u00a0\"The Sister's Wedding\" and \"How the Lake was created\" (2006). as the only two stories that she knew.\u00a0}",
