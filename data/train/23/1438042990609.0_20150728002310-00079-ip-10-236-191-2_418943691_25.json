They were based upon the earlier National Bank Notes. They differed from Federal Reserve Notes in that they could only be redeemed at the Federal Reserve bank that issued them. Federal Reserve notes could be redeemed at any Federal Reserve bank. As large size notes they were first issued in 1914 with a design that shared elements with the both the National Bank Notes, and the Federal Reserve Notes of the time, but as small size notes they were issued only as an emergency issue in 1933 using the same paper stock used for National Bank Notes. This emergency issue was prompted by the public hoarding of cash because of the many bank failures happening at the time. This also limited the ability of the National Banks to issue notes of their own. They were phased out within 2 years, but served their purpose dutifully. As small size notes, they have brown seals and serial numbers, the same as National Bank Notes of the era.}",
