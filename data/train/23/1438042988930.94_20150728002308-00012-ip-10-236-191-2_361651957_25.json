If you revert the servers in a cluster to run an older product release, you must manually reset database replication within the cluster. To reset database replication after you revert all the cluster servers to the older product release, use the utils dbreplication reset command all on the publisher server. Reset database replication when reverting to prior release Then, use the utils dbreplication stop and then utils dbreplication reset all commands on the publisher server. If the servers are not in Replication State 2, use the utils dbreplication stop command on all subscriber servers. Solution\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
