    "textAfterTable": "Usage Guidelines To use this command, you must be in a user group associated with a task group that includes appropriate task IDs. If the user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for assistance. The accounting per-prefix command is used to enable per-prefix counters only in hardware. Cisco\u00a0IOS\u00a0XR Software counters are always present. When enabled, every existing and new (S, G) route is assigned forward, punt, and drop counters on the ingress route and forward and punt counters on the egress route. The (*, G) routes are assigned a single counter. There are a limited number of counters on all nodes. When a command is enabled, counters are assigned to routes only if they are available. Because the use of this counter can be resource-intensive when a large number of routes are configured, such as for multicast VPN (there is a limit of 150,000 routes to a router), use the show mfib hardware resource-counters command in EXEC mode to check resource allocation. Should hardware resource allocation be an issue, we recommend the use of the accounting per-prefix forward-only command. To verify the number",
