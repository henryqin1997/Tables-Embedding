No. 5,968,551, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/133,503 filed Oct. 7, 1993, abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of both U.S. patent application Ser.

U.S. application Ser. No. 08/133,503 is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/097,558 filed Jul. 27, 1993, now U.S. Pat.

No. 5,286,493., 51334=In one preferred embodiment, the acrylic coating is an acrylic resin lacquers used in the form of an aqueous dispersion, such as that which is commercially available from Rohm Pharma under the Tradename Eudragit\ufffd. In further preferred embodiments, the acrylic coating comprises a mixture of two acrylic resin lacquers commercially available from Rohm Pharma under the Tradenames Eudragit\ufffd RL 30 D and Eudragit\ufffd RS 30 D, respectively. Eudragit\ufffd RL 30 D and Eudragit\ufffd RS 30 D are copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters with a low content of quaternary ammonium groups, the molar ratio of ammonium groups to the remaining neutral (meth)acrylic esters being 1:20 in Eudragit\ufffd RL 30 D and 1:40 in Eudragit\ufffd RS 30 D. The mean molecular weight is about 150,000. The code designations RL (high permeability) and RS (low permeability) refer to the permeability properties of these agents. Eudragit\ufffd RL/RS mixtures are insoluble in water and in digestive fluids. However, coatings formed from the same are swellable and permeable in aqueous solutions and digestive fluids., 66197=At least one polyalkylene glycol may be, for example, polypropylene glycol or, preferably, polyethylene glycol. The number average molecular weight of the at least one polyalkylene glycol is preferred between 1000 and 15000 especially between 1500 and 12000., 65733=In one embodiment, the ratio of, e.g., at least one hydroxyalkyl cellulose or acrylic resin to at least one aliphatic alcohol/polyalkylene glycol determines, to a considerable extent, the release rate of the opioid from the formulation. A ratio of the at least one hydroxyalkyl cellulose to at least one aliphatic alcohol/polyalkylene glycol of between 1:2 and 1:4 is preferred, with a ratio of between 1:3 and 1:4 being particularly preferred., 87556=After completion of the coating process, the coated beads are taken from the Wurster Insert to a tray and then cured in a chamber at a temperature of 60\ufffd C. and humidity of 80% RH for 72 hours. Upon completion of the curing process, the beads are dried to a LOD of 4% or less. The beads are then given a final overcoating of Opadry\ufffd Red YS-1-1841 (15% w/w solution) with the use of the Wurster Insert. The coated morphine sulfate beads are then filled into hard gelatin capsules.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The examples provided above are not meant to be exclusive. Many other variations of the present invention would be obvious to those skilled in the art, and are contemplated to be within the scope of the appended claims. Therefore, it is surprising result that a bioavailable once-a-day product was only produced when the sustained release opioid was formulation as a multiparticulate system (in this instance beads) as opposed to the sustained release tablet formulation, which from all other indications would have been expected to have substantially identical bioavailability. From the bioavailability studies, it can be observed that all three of the bead products of Examples 1, 2 and 3 exhibit pharmacokinetic properties which would aglow them to be suitable for once-a-day administration. In other words, the bead products of Examples 1-3 were all bioavailable (as determined by comparing the AUC of the bead product to the AUC of the reference standard, MS Contin\ufffd). However, the tablet products-of Example 4 were surprisingly not bioavailable despite the reduction of the peak plasma concentration (cmax) and the lengthening of the time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax) and W-50 and even though the dissolution studies show that the morphine sulfate was released from the tablet products in-vitro over the same time period as the bead products.
