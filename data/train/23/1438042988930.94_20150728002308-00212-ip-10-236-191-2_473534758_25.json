However, the technical spheres described in these prior arts are to fix carbon black onto the iron-based black particles, and are quite different from those techniques for obtaining a colorant having a high chroma. In addition, since the iron-based particles have a specific gravity as high as 5 to 5.5, it may be difficult to obtain an ink-jet printing ink having a sufficient dispersion stability when the iron-based particles are used as a colorant therefor., 107056=(4) The specific gravity of each of the core particles, organic pigments, colorant for ink-let printing ink, and organic and inorganic composite particles was measured using a \u201cMulti-Volume Densitometer 1305-Model\u201d (manufactured by Micro-Meritix Co., Ltd.)., 31412=Conventionally, there are known ink-jet printing inks using pigments (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) Nos. 9-227812(1997), 11-131001(1999) and 2000-53901); colorants prepared by coupling pigments with resins particles using a coupling agent (Japanese Patent Nos. 2903631 and 3097208); and colorants prepared by bonding dyes onto the surface of silica particles through a coupling agent (Japanese Patent No. 3105511)., 32169=That is, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) Nos. 9-227812(1997) and 2000-53901, there is described an aqueous ink-jet recording liquid containing pigments and colloidal silica for the purpose of obtaining high-quality printed images. However, the organic pigments exhibit a poor dispersibility in an ink-jet printing ink composition, so that the resultant ink-jet printing ink fails to exhibit a good dispersion stability and a sufficient light resistance of printed images thereof. In addition, since a large amount of the colloidal silica not contributing to coloring is contained in the ink composition, it is difficult to sufficiently increase the pigment concentration thereof, thereby failing to obtain high-density printed images.}",
