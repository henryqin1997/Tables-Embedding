The database server 1190 supports saving database files, event logging, event scheduling, database server services, and database security access.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{99575=In addition to demographic information gathered, the viewing population information can be compiled using other methods. For instance, viewing population information can be gathered using questionnaires sent by mail to subscribers or collected over the telephone from subscribers and subsequently entered in the viewing population information database 1210. Subscriber preference information may be collected in surveys, including information such as sex, age, place of birth, place of lower school education, employment type, level of education, amount of television program viewing per week, and the number of television shows in particular categories that the subscriber watches in a given week such as, sports, movies, documentaries, sitcoms, amount of Internet use and favorite web sites, etc. Any demographic information that will assist the TVOMS 300 in targeting virtual objects may be collected. The viewing population data collection engine 1202 may gather marketing information from various sources and index the information for inclusion in the viewing population information database 1210., 42900=Television as an advertising medium has undergone significant advances since its inception in 1939. Modern advances in digital technology now allow viewers to be very selective in choosing programs to watch. Other advances in digital technology have led to such programming enhancements as a \u201ctail\u201d on a hockey puck, or an overlaid first down marker on a football field. The same technological advances allow improvements in the way advertisements are currently presented. Many sporting events are now presented with virtual object advertisements included in the video. For example, the broadcast of a major league baseball game may include one or more virtual object spots in which an advertisement is displayed. The advertisements are then seen by television viewers, but not by fans who attend the game. However, the advertisements are fixed, and are not varied according to individual viewers., 98630=A part of the TVOMS 300 operation is the collection of viewing population data, and the assimilation of the viewing population data into the virtual objects selection method. This operation typically includes two steps. First, viewing population data is retrieved from various sources. The viewing population data is then compiled and sent to the viewing population data collection engine 1202 in the operations center 10. Once assembled, the data is filtered for each application of the TVOMS 300. In an embodiment, the viewing population information database 1210 receives inputs from the viewing population data collection engine 1202 and a configuration set-up system 1205. The viewing population information database 1210 provides outputs to the configuration set-up system 1205, and the virtual object targeting system 1220., 129528=The resource management engine 1305 functions to divide available delivery bandwidth among multiple virtual objects for a given virtual object location 37 in the content 36. Because there may be a limited amount of resources on the delivery network 11 to deliver virtual objects with the content 36, the resource management engine 1305 may assign the available bandwidth optimally for the virtual objects associated with the individual virtual object locations within the content 36 being delivered over the communication channels. Some virtual object locations may be assigned multiple virtual objects, each targeted to a different group or groups, whereas other virtual object locations may be assigned only a single virtual object 38., 140095=In an embodiment, the group assignment engine 1309 receives inputs from the resource management engine 1305 and the virtual object placement engine 1307 and then determines which target category groups will view specific targeted virtual objects. Thus, for each virtual object location 37, the group assignment engine 1309 assigns groups of reception sites to each of the virtual objects. The reception sites may be assigned based on their placement within a group (i.e., based on their group assignment number) as defined by the group assignment rules received from the operations center 10. In table C, the assignments are shown based on the group assignment numbers. As also shown in Table C, the group addressing for a virtual object location 37 may be based on a single category of targeting. This may avoid a conflict regarding which virtual object 38 a reception site 30 may retrieve., 291369=In another embodiment, the signal delivered over the cable system is a video signal. In one embodiment, the video signal is an analog video signal. In another embodiment, the video signal is a digital video signal. The reception site 30 may contain an internal cable receiver/tuner/demodulator 2706 to process the signal, and provide the embedded virtual objects to the modular connector 700. A set top terminal 2703, or other device capable of receiving a cable video signal, such as a cable ready TV, or PC with cable tuner (not shown), may process the video signal and deliver the video signal to the connector 700 in the reception site 30, which extracts the embedded virtual objects. Alternately, the set top terminal 2703, or other such device, may extract the embedded virtual objects from the video signal and provide the virtual objects to the modular connector 700 in the reception site 30., 146374=The group breakdown percentage data may be derived from information resident in the viewing population information database 1210 or a number of sources including surveys, and program ratings services such as Nielsen or Arbitron, for example. In this example, the group assignment numbers are the same as those presented in Table A. Thus, target categories 1 and 2 each have four groups associated with them, and target category 3 has six groups associated with it. For virtual object location 1, the target category 1 refers to ADI and under group 1, a group breakdown percentage of 25 percent is assigned for group 1 from the target category ADI since 25 percent of the subscribers reside in the Seattle, Wash. ADI. The group breakdown percentages for each target category for each virtual object location 37 may sum to 100 percent., 101307=The communications server 1191 performs the following functions on database data: integrity check, filtering, processing, and uploading viewing population data from external sources using the viewing population data collection engine 1202. The workstation 1192 allows for operator viewing and entry of viewing population data into the viewing population information database 1210., 310681=Alternatively, several embodiments are associated with the delivery of virtual objects using a national or local radio broadcaster's signal. The signal from the national radio broadcaster can be delivered to the reception site 30\u2032, 30\u2033 or 30\u2032\u2033 using the satellite system 1122, or using a broadcast affiliate 1122. Alternatively, the radio broadcast affiliate 1122 can originate the signal, which can be delivered to the reception site 30\u2032, 30\u2033 or 30\u2032\u2033, terrestrially. In one embodiment, the audio signal is an analog audio signal and the virtual objects is embedded in the audio signal. In another embodiment, the audio signal is a digital audio signal and the virtual objects are carried as an independent data stream. In yet another embodiment, the virtual objects are embedded in a sub-carrier of the analog audio broadcast. In another embodiment, the signal is a spread spectrum signal containing a digital data stream, requiring an appropriate spread spectrum receiver modular connector 700 in the reception site 30\u2032, 30\u2033 or 30\u2032\u2033 to extract the virtual objects. In this embodiment, the spread spectrum signal is transmitted in the same bandwidth as the audio signal, but below the noise level., 299730=In another embodiment, the signal delivered over the satellite broadcast system is a video signal. In one embodiment, the video signal is an analog video signal. In another embodiment, the video signal is a digital video signal. The reception site 30 may contain an internal satellite video receiver 2906 to process the signal, and provide the embedded virtual objects to the modular connector 700. A satellite receiver 2903, or other device capable of receiving a satellite video signal, such as a TV, or PC with satellite receiver, may process the video signal and deliver the video signal to the modular connector 700 in the reception site 30, which extracts the embedded virtual objects. Alternately, the satellite receiver 2903, or other such device, may extract the embedded virtual objects from the video signal and provide the data to the modular connector in the reception site 258., 295398=In another embodiment, the signal delivered over the wireless broadcast system is a video signal. In one embodiment, the video signal is an analog video signal. In another 5 embodiment, the video signal is a digital video signal. The reception site 30 may contain an internal wireless receiver/tuner/demodulator 2806 to process the signal, and provide the embedded virtual objects to the modular connector 700. A wireless set-top terminal 2803, or other device capable of receiving a wireless video signal, such as a TV, or PC with a wireless receiver and tuner, may process the video signal and deliver the video signal to the modular connector 700 in the reception site 30, which extracts the embedded virtual objects. Alternately, the set top terminal 2803, or other such device, may extract the embedded virtual objects from the video signal and provide the data to the modular connector 700 in the reception site 30., 141819=In an embodiment, the virtual object targeting system 1220 provides a virtual object generation request command 1261 to the content and virtual object packager 1260. The virtual objects generation request command 1261 specifies which particular virtual objects are to be displayed in a particular virtual object location 37, and the actual location of the virtual objects. The virtual object 38 is then retrieved from the available virtual object database 1265. The virtual objects, along with the retrieval plan, and content 36 and associated metadata packets are provided to the delivery processor 1300 for delivery to the appropriate reception sites., 90219=Within the TVOMS 300, the virtual object targeting system 1220 is responsible for the intelligent and rapid selection of virtual objects for placement in content 36. Category and group targeting is managed in a manner similar to that described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/597,893, entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TARGETING VIRTUAL OBJECTS, filed Jun. 19, 2000, and in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/054,419 entitled TARGETED ADVERTISEMENT USING TELEVISION DELIVERY SYSTEM, filed Apr. 3, 1998, and in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/328,672 entitled ELECTRONIC BOOK SELECTION AND DELIVERY SYSTEM WITH TARGETED ADVERTISING, filed on Jun. 9, 1999, each of which are incorporated herein by reference., 141094=The group assignment engine 1309 provides an output to the retrieval plan generator 1275. The output indicates which group assignment numbers (i.e., which groups of reception sites) are assigned to a virtual object 38 for a given virtual object location 37 in the content 36. The retrieval plan generator 1275 then generates a bit word, or group mask assignment, that is used to assign the groups to virtual objects. Once generated, the retrieval plan is provided to the delivery processor 1300 for distribution along with the content 36 and the actual virtual objects to reception sites by object delivery center 15., 287288=The above algorithm performed by the virtual object placement engine 1307 is meant to be illustrative and not limiting. Other algorithms are possible for assigning targeted virtual objects to groups of reception sites or to individual reception sites. Other targeted virtual object routines can also be used by the virtual object placement engine 1307., 111780=The processor 1207 also generates the group assignment rules for distribution to reception sites. The group assignment rules allow for the assignment of a group number to each reception site 30 for each target category based on information collected and stored at the reception site 30. The information used in conjunction with the group assignment rules is maintained in a subscriber database within the group assignment rules processor 735 at the reception site 30. Each reception site 30 populates its subscriber database through a variety of means, including subscriber input via a user interface at the reception site 30. Subscriber inputs may be driven by reception site prompts upon receipt of group assignment rules from the operations center 10 or other on-screen questionnaires generated by the reception site 30. The subscriber database may be populated automatically by the reception site 30 as events take place at the reception site such as programs are watched by the subscriber or selected for recording, virtual objects are viewed by the subscriber, PPV events are purchased, interactive virtual objects are selected, or based on Internet usage. Alternatively, upon installation of the reception site 30, an installer or the subscriber may complete an installation process that results in the subscriber database being populated. Additionally, the reception site 30 may contain, or interface to, a Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receiver that may provide accurate reception site location information that is stored in the subscriber database for use in locality-based targeting. Subscriber database information may also come from external sources such as downloads from the Internet or, from the operations center 10 or local insertion center 20 using group assignment rules. Information contained in the subscriber database at the reception site 30 may include the following:, 94792=Once specific virtual objects are selected for one or more available virtual object locations, the groups that should view each virtual object 38 are determined, based on the target category of interest. For example, in target category ADI, and group Los Angeles, Calif., a virtual object related to a Los Angeles area professional basketball team maybe considered appropriate as an advertisement for professional basketball while in the group Washington, D.C., a virtual object related to a Washington, D.C. professional basketball team might be considered appropriate. The selected virtual object locations 37 may include all virtual object locations, or a subset of all the virtual object locations. A retrieval plan is generated by the retrieval plan generator 1275 which provides information concerning which target category and group is assigned to each virtual object 38 associated with each virtual object location 37. The retrieval plan may provide information for one virtual object location 37 or multiple virtual object locations within content 36, where one or more virtual objects, target categories, and the groups to which each virtual object 38 is targeted within each virtual object location 37 is also provided in the retrieval plan. An example retrieval plan is provided in Table C below. Retrieval plans may be distributed along with the virtual objects and the associated content 36 directly to the reception sites by the delivery processor 1300 or using the object delivery center 15. Alternatively, a retrieval plan may be distributed by the delivery processor 1300 or using the object delivery center 15 independent of the associated content 36 or virtual objects., 41252=This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser.
