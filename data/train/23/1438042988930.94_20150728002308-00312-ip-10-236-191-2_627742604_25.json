            "Transfer raw ALTM 1225 flight data, airborne GPS data collected at 1 Hz using Ashtech receiver, and ground-based GPS data collected at 1 Hz using Ashtech and Trimble 4000SSI receivers to NT workstation. Generate decimated lidar point file from above three data sets using Optech's Realm 2.27 software. This is a 9-column ASCII data set with the following format: time tag; first pulse Easting, Northing, HAE; last pulse Easting, Northing, HAE; first pulse intensity; and last pulse intensity. View decimated lidar point file to check data coverage (i.e. sufficient overlap of flight lines and point spacing). Compute base station coordinates using National Geodetic Survey's PAGES software. Computed aircraft trajectories for both base stations using National Geodetic Survey's KINPOS software. Coordinates for base stations and trajectories are in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame of 2000 (ITRF2000) datum. Trajectories from both base stations were merged into one. Weighting for trajectory merge is based upon baseline length (distance from base station) and solution RMS. Transformed trajectory solution from ITRF2000 to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Use NAD83 trajectories and aircraft inertial measurement unit data in Applanix's POSProc version 2.1.4 to compute an optimal 50Hz inertial navigation solution. Substitute the aircraft position and attitude information from the inertial navigation solution into Realm 2.27. Extract calibration area data set from lidar point file for quality control and instrument calibration checks. If necessary, use multiple iterations to adjust calibration parameters (pitch, roll, and scale) and reprocess sample data set. Then generate entire lidar point file (9-column ASCII file). Use the Geiod99 geoid model to convert from Height Above the GRS80 ellipsoid to elevations with respect to the North American Vertical Datum 88 (NAVD88). Transfer point file from NT workstation to UNIX workstation. Parse the 9-column lidar point file into 3.75-minute quarter-quadrangle components and apply elevation bias correction (determined during calibration step). There are some points in the file that only contain 5-columns. These are points that either the first or last pulse was not recorded. UTM Easting and Northing were converted to geodetic latitude and longitude with respect to the GRS80 ellipsoid. The conversion was computed using the TMGEOD and TCONPC fortran subroutines written by T. Vincenty (NGS). Each record contains 9 columns of data: time tag (seconds in the GPS week), first return Latitude, first return Longitude, first return NAVD88, last return Latitude, last return Longitude, last return NAVD88, first return intensity, and last return intensity. In some cases either the first or last return values may be missing (5 columns). Latitude and longitude are in decimal degrees with nine significant digits to retain the 0.01m resolution of the UTM coordinates. West longitude is negative and north latitude is positive. The eighteen UTM quarter-quad files were re-organized into eleven files. UTM quarter-quads files that were delineated by the same upper and lower latitude bounds were concatenated. The lat-long files were named by the month-year of the survey (e.g. may02) and the lower latitude bounding the quarter-quad.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received files in ASCII format. The files contained LiDAR intensity and elevation measurements. CSC performed the following processing on the data to make it available within the LiDAR Data Retrieval Tool (LDART) 1. Data returned to ellipsoid heights from NAVD88, using GEOID99. 2. Data converted to LAS format. 3. The LAS data were sorted by latitude and the headers were updated.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
