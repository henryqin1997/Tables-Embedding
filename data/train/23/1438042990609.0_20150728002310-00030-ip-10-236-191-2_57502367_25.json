Brady, though, overthrew new deep threat Brandon Lloyd on a fake end-around, and New England wound up punting. But on their next series, the Patriots reached the end zone as Brady found tight end Aaron Hernandez for a 23-yard touchdown with 1:59 remaining in the first quarter., 77229=Brady, who suffered a bloody nose on the previous possession, then led New England on a 67-yard drive, capping the 12-play march with a two-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski. Gronkowski set NFL records for tight ends with 1,327 yards and 17 receiving touchdowns last season.}",
