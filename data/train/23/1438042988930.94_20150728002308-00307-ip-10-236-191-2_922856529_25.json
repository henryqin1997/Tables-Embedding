I think the grill and the sandwiches are the best--only because it is the least salty. The breakfast is quite amazing here (FYI)., 140642=Mount St. Mary's College is great for women who are interested in female empowerment. The students could be more active on campus, and that may change in Fall 2012 now that we have our new President. We are a liberal arts college, so expect to be well-rounded!, 310675=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

There is a lot of help provided to everyone either with the teacher, students or in the Learning Resource Center where there is tutoring most of the time for various subjects.

Tips for prospective students Make sure you give your all once you start. Nursing program is extremely competitive. It is a small school so make sure you are out of the high school mind set and a serious college student. Learn to say no before you start,",
