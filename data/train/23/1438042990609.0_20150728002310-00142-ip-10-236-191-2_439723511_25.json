The method includes receiving pressure information from the bidirectional pressure sensor. The method includes using the pressure information to evaluate, at a processing circuit, pressure at the bidirectional pressure sensor over time, The method includes assigning a flow direction to a current pressure of the bidirectional pressure sensor by comparing the current pressure to at least one past pressure. 20140124057 Published Description Patent application number Mark G. Freund, Wauwatosa, WI US 05-10-2012 EVALUATING CAPITAL FOR REPLACEMENT - A method for evaluating an asset for replacement includes retrieving one or more pieces of information corresponding to the asset, each piece of information corresponding to one or more factors, wherein each factor has an associated factor weight, determining, by a processing device, an associated factor score for each factor based at least in part on the pieces of information corresponding to the factor, the factor score for each factor also based at least in part on the associated factor weight, and determining a replacement eligibility score based upon the factor scores associated with two or more of the factors. In some embodiments, the method includes comparing a plurality of replacement eligibility scores corresponding to a plurality of assets and initiating creation",

Freund, Mountain View, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20140068434 ADJUSTING AUDIO VOLUME OF MULTIMEDIA WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN MULTIPLE MULTIMEDIA CONTENT - A multiple media module receives data indicating a status of a tab of a graphical user interface (GUI) presented on a user device. The multiple media module determines, based on the data indicating the status of the tab, whether the tab is active, the tab comprising a streaming media player. If the tab of the web browser is not active, the multiple media module mutes an audio component of a streaming media file playing in the streaming media player. 03-06-2014 20140095514 Ordinal Positioning Of Content Items Based On Viewport - Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for adjusting ordinal positions for content item slots in response to determining that a content item slot with a highest slot ordinal position relative to the other content item slots in a resource is not within a viewport area. Adjusting the adjusting ordinal positions of either the content item slots or content items to be served in the content item slots ensures that a content item slot in the viewport displays a content item with a highest respective ordinal position in a ranking relative to other content items is rendered in the content item slot within the viewport area. 04-03-2014 Martin Brandt Freund, Mountain View, CA US",
