A stress fracture of the back quickly halted the start to his career and his workload has been carefully managed since. But he has been drip-fed into the Gloucestershire first XI and his strong, thick-set frame has demonstrated enough potential to earn an extended contract to 2017., 57425=Jun 21, 2013, 35138=Born December 27, 1991, Bournemouth, Dorset, 52216=2014 saw Norwell's finest moment in a Gloucestershire shirt, surprisingly with the bat. He made 78 against Worcestershire at Cheltenham in July 2014 - the highest score by a No. 11 for the county - and shared a stand of 137 with Craig Miles for the 10th wicket - also a county record. Unfortunately the feats only delayed a heavy defeat. ESPNcricinfo staff}",
