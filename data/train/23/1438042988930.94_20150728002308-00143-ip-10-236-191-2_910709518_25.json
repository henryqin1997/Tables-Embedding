            "The campus is vary safe during the day and at night. Hays has a fairly low crime rate and the campus police do a wonderful job to ensure the safety of the students.",
            "Although not many, Fort Hays does have a few sororities and fraternities.",
            "FHSU has a variety of clubs and activities it offers. Make sure to check out what is available and which ones match your interests!",
            "Any and all. Students from rural or urban areas, outgoing or shy, young or old. Fort Hays is a great place for everyone.",
            "Oktoberfest and Homecoming are traditions at FHSU. The Union is located on campus and offers a great environment to just hang out or study.",
            "As stated, Fort Hays offers affordable success. The price for classes are low compared to other universities in Kansas. The price is low compared to the high quality education you will receive.",
            "Hays has a lot to offer on campus and off including: bowling, recreational sports, shopping, and a water park.",
            "The Union at Fort Hays has a newly added Starbucks, as well as a cafeteria offering a variety of different foods. The prices are reasonable and the quality of food is good. If you decide to leave campus, Hays offers a variety of different food places to choose from.",
            "I didn't personally live in the dorms, but have had family members and friend who did at FHSU. If I could go back, I would have lived in the dorms at least my Freshman year. Some of the dorm rooms are kind of small, but it just depends on the dorm you live in. You can choose from a coed dorm or an all-male or all-female dorm. Living in a dorm is the best way to get to know new people at the university.",
            "The difficulty of classes at FHSU is adequate to their class level. The professors expect a lot of their students, but are also willing to put in some extra time if the student is having some difficulty. Many of the professors develop a friendship with their students and try to get to know them as well as they can.",
            "Visit the campus! Fort Hays has a beautiful campus and is currently undergoing construction to make it even better. This is an ideal school for someone who is from a small town and not wanting to attend a big university.",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck FHSU has the least expensive tuition out of the Universities in Kansas. Even though FHSU is the cheapest on tuition rates they don't cut back on any of their resources to the students or class materials. Am enjoying being here The people are great very nice, helpful and fun to be around. I was new to the campus and to Hays in January and now it seems like I grew up around here it's great! I grew up in a big city and I was worried about the transition to a smaller town but it wasn't so different, which was a big relief for me. Am learning a lot My classes are great! I have so much fun in them and learn a lot. Everyone has had those teachers that say they care but they really could care less about you or your grade. That is far from the case at FHSU the teachers really do care about your grades and are willing to help you on anything they possibly can no matter how long it might take.
