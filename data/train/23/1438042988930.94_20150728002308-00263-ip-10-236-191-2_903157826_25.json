            "This is a small campus shared with Adirondack Community College, it is generally very peaceful and friendly.",
            "Non-existent at the branch campus location.",
            "The branch campus does not sponsor any clubs or activities at the branch. Students are welcome at the ACC campus events.",
            "Great for young people in the area interested in one of the four year programs offered here, can help save you money on education if you don't have to leave home for it. Great for adult learners to continue their education while working and raising families.",
            "The branch campus is still fairly young and is working on developing more of a presence, traditions are yet to come.",
            "Nationally accredited four year degrees without having to live away from home while studying really cuts the cost compared to other programs.",
            "Join ACC students on the quad for Frisbee, enjoy the Saratoga-Glens Falls-Lake George area social outlets and Aviation Mall for movies. Students can get discounted tickets in the ACC student center.",
            "The food and dining options at the branch campus are limited, they are only open part of the day. Pack a lunch or go to a nearby restaurant, some offer college discounts.",
            "Non-existent at the branch campus in Queensbury, not applicable.",
            "The courses are generally rigorous as compared to freshman and sophomore courses. I feel ready to take on Masters level work now.",
            "Course selection is limited due to the fact this is a branch campus. Be prepared to take web courses and use cross registration with ACC as allowed. Realize there is not much flexibility in your schedule as times will be determined by course offerings. Follow your CAPP report, again there is not much wiggle room if you take courses out of the program's designed sequence and meet the requirements within 4 semesters for junior and senior years.",
            "Professional, dedicated educators and staff at the Queensbury Branch Campus have made my experience here very rewarding. It is very convenient to have access to a 4 year degree program at the local community college campus, which is easy to navigate and accessible. I feel confident I am getting top-level education."

This campus is currently building dorms and dining facilities for 400 students that will be available in the fall of 2013. There are nature trails for walking at the campus and a near by bike path that leads to Lake George., 138762=Eeek. Kidding kidding. There are two dinning halls on campus and one take out place where freshman are allowed unlimited swipes. The food in those dining halls isn't what your mother/ grandmother made but it is edible. Some days the food is better than others. October had been a pretty good month food-wise because we had October fest and Saint John's took over the food one night for a celebration and the food was awesome. One thing I really love is late night. It is awesome when you have a class or lab in my case that ends after 9. With your one late night swipe you can get food at subway or the Sundowner (the best dining hall on campus), 134109=Currently there are no dorms. They will be completed in 2013., 133647=The quality of food has increased over the last few weeks and one of the cafes is currently being renovated for the Fall semester. In 2013 the cafeteria will be renovated as well., 253482=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "However, learning is not just in classroom. I am learning to live on my own. I am also learning that being independent is a lot harder than I thought it would be. Classes are fairly decent, but I feel that most of the time, I have to be teaching myself. The professors barely use the books in class, but have the students read several chapters after one class. Time management is something I am still learning.

Art, education, political, and science-based studies are the most suited here. Tips for prospective students If you haven't applied to Plattsburgh already, I would recommend doing so. It wasn't my first choice to be honest, but I promise that should you attend, you will not be disappointed. Bang for the buck",
