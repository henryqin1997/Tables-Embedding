    "textAfterTable": "Comments Great for these types of students If you are wanting to study Criminal Justice, come and get in Dr. Larkins and Ms. Reed's program. They will turn you into amazing Crim students. Tips for prospective students If you want a great learning experience and people who care about you getting a degree, come to ASU Beebe. Bang for the buck I had to pay a little out of pocket but that was because I didn't have enough scholarships. Am enjoying being here The people are great. There are people from everywhere and listening to the things people have done are incredible. The dorms on campus are amazing! Am learning a lot I love ASU. Most of the teachers here are great they want you to learn. I was not planning on staying in college; however, I found out when I came to ASU how much I could learn.
