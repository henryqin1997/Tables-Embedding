Last year, more than 32,000 students enrolled in a wide variety of degree and certificate programs; on their way to achieving personal goals. From learning a particular subject to earning a degree or certificate to preparing for a new career or transfer to a university, students are always working hard, making life happen. The main campus at GCC North locations offers classes and programs throughout the West valley. There are supportive faculty members and helpful student services. They are ready to provide each student with the knowledge, skills and support they will need to succeed in the college and the world beyond it.

You will need to keep up with the requirements such as a 3.25 GPA and 12 credit hours which include one honors class. As long as you study, be attentive, and do your homework it will not be difficult to keep! Bang for the buck Glendale Community College is extremely affordable. They offer academic scholarships through high school placement, placement testing, and an honors program. Saving money is critically important, and going through community college either to achieve an associates degree or transfer to a university is the way to go! Glendale Community College is the school everyone should consider around the Maricopa County. Am enjoying being here The atmosphere overall is positive and pleasant. Professors are also fun and enjoyable through class. I found that it was very easy to be attentive in all of my classes and I never got bored. There are a lot of staff at the campuses that are more than willing to help new students with smiles. Am learning a lot The professors at the Glendale Community College Main",
