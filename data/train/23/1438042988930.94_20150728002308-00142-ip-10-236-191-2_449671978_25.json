            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ENCODING/DECODING 3D MESH INFORMATION INCLUDING STITCHING INFORMATION - Provided are encoding and decoding stitching information generated when the 3D mesh model that is the non-manifold or non-orientable model is converted into orientable and manifold models upon encoding the 3D mesh information of the 3D mesh model. The method of encoding 3D mesh information includes the steps of: encoding the 3D mesh information to output an encoded bitstream; encoding stitching information of elements contained in the 3D mesh information, the stitching information having a total number of duplicated original elements and, for each of the duplicated original elements, the duplication number, original-element identification information and duplicated-element identification information; and generating a packet of the bitstream, wherein the encoded stitching information is inserted into the packet.",
            "METHOD AND DEVICE FOR VIDEO CODING AND DECODING - A method of encoding/decoding a video and an apparatus thereof are disclosed. An embodiment of the present invention provides an encoding/decoding method and apparatus thereof that can interpolate a frame to be skipped with the consideration of the property of the frame. Accordingly, an embodiment of the present invention can encode and decode by using a frame-skipping method having low complexity."

Since the method of the present invention is capable of fabricating a gas barrier film by plasma surface treatment instead of deposition under high vacuum, it can mass-produce a transparent gas barrier film with excellent gas barrier properties in an economical and simple manner. Further, since the transparent gas barrier film fabricated according to the method of the present invention shows excellent gas barrier properties and is free of crack formation and layer-peeling phenomenon, it can be effectively used in the manufacture of a variety of display panels. 11-11-2010 Jae Hong Jun, Seoul KR Patent application number Description Published 20110211147 LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY PANEL AND FABRICATING METHOD AND APPARATUS THEREOF - The disclosed invention is with regard to a liquid crystal display panel including a substrate having a plurality of layers formed thereon, and having a first surface region and a second surface region on a surface of an uppermost",
