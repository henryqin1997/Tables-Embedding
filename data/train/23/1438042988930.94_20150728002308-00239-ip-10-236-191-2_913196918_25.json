            "You will ALWAYS be able to spot campus security. Will the unnecessarily bother you? NOT AT ALL. They are cool and make the campus safer, they are constantly on patrol and when their services are needed they take their security job as serious as a police officer would.",
            "Every class will be associated with a club. Chemistry class you will be in chem club, for MEd lab tech students you are apart of MLT club ect.",
            "There is something for everyone. There are are shows, theaters, intramural sports and just the general social life amon the students on campus.",
            "Since there are no dorms there is no meal plan so food is out of pocket costs. But there are places to eat in the area.",
            "SUNY Orange doesn't not have a dorm just yet, but there has been some talk about getting some. If there are dorms in the near future it is DEFINITELY the ideal college life.",
            "The professors are SERIOUS about their jobs and they expect all students to give it their best shot.",
            "Going to SUNY Orange is great for those wanting to build your GPA to transfer and possibly even get scholarships to local and out of state four year colleges and universities. It is actually even smarter to do so if you aren't sure if what you chose is right for you. I suggest that prospective students really take a look into requirements for the BA degree then look into SUNY Orange to see what can get done for a lot cheaper.",
            "SUNY Orange is a school that is working to become recognized among the state as one of the top schools. The Health profession programs are outstanding and the instructors work to make sure each student is understanding course materials. It is a school I personally recommend to parents while on the job for their upcoming high school graduates as well as those in professional settings."
