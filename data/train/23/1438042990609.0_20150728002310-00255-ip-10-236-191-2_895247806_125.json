I've already completed 16 credit hours since September and aim to double that by the time the summer semester starts. The flexibility of the class scheduling and the approachability of the professors combined with fairly rigorous academic standards and expectations makes this well worth the price of tuition., 463292=Depending on what class you take, the workload can go from 2 questions to a 1500 word essay a week. It can get crazy in there., 526879=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 26485=The classes are how you make them. The classes are eight weeks long so everything that is normally in a semester from August to December is crammed, so you really have to be focused. The professors are very eager to help. Because we are not in a classroom setting, our basic way of communication is thru weekly conferences. Make sure you reply to whatever topic it is for the week. When the professor responds, respond back to him or her. You will receive assistance from an adviser, that will tell you what path you should take with what ever major you have., 289524=i am currently enrolled in the online 1 year mba program which started fall 2011. i researched a lot of universities before deciding on this one and am pleased with my decision so far., 170489=There are three divisions: USA, Europe and Asia. Each once may have different classes and can only be taken one at a time but change of division easy. If taking online classes and military, nothing except the type of classes may change. May sure to apply for transfer credit evaluation within the first two semesters to compensate for any documents the school may need. In addition to the latter, UMUC is very flexible is awarding transfer credit!}",
