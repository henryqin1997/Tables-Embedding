S. Allen, M. A. Johnson, P. K. T. Oldring, M. S. Salim-Edited by P. K. T. Oldring-1991-ISBN 0 947798102., 61036=In U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,027,857, 6,171,735, 6,420,089, 6,071,675, 6,245,481, 6,387,595, 6,482,571, 6,576,401 and 6,548,222 a method is disclosed for preparing a lithographic printing plate wherein a photopolymer plate, after image-wise exposure, is mounted on a press and processed on-press by applying ink and fountain to remove the unexposed areas from the support. Also US 2003/16577 and US 2004/13968 disclose a method wherein a plate comprising a photopolymerizable layer can be processed in an on-press processing with fountain and ink or with a non-alkaline aqueous developer., 58283=Digital plates can roughly be divided in three categories: (i) silver plates, which work according to the silver salt diffusion transfer mechanism; (ii) photopolymer plates which contain a photopolymerizable composition that hardens upon exposure to light and (iii) thermal plates of which the imaging mechanism is triggered by heat or by light-to-heat conversion. Thermal plates are mainly sensitized for infrared lasers emitting at 830 nm or 1064 nm. Photopolymers can be sensitized for blue, green or red light (i.e. wavelength range between 450 and 750 nm), for violet light (i.e. wavelength range between 350 and 450 nm) or for infrared light (i.e. wavelength range between 750 and 1500 nm). Laser sources have been increasingly used to expose a printing plate precursor which is sensitized to a corresponding laser wavelength. Typically, an Ar laser (488 nm) or a FD-YAG laser (532 nm) can be used for exposing a visible light sensitized photopolymer plate. The wide-scale availability of low cost blue or violet laser diodes, originally developed for data storage by means of DVD, has enabled the production of plate-setters operating at shorter wavelength. More specifically, semiconductor lasers emitting from 350 to 450 nm have been realized using an InGaN material. An infrared laser diode emitting around 830 nm or a Nd-YAG laser emitting around 1060 nm can also be used., 112863=The image-wise exposing step can be carried out by a laser, e.g. laser diodes emitting around 830 nm, NdYAG lasers emitting around 1060 nm, violet lasers emitting around 400 nm or a gas laser such as Ar laser, by digital modulated UV-exposure, e.g. by means of digital mirror devices, or by a conventional exposure in contact with a mask. The laser exposure and digital modulated UV-exposure are preferred., 93447=The photopolymerizable layer may also comprise a binder. The binder can be selected from a wide series of organic polymers. Compositions of different binders can also be used. Useful binders include for example chlorinated polyalkylene (in particular chlorinated polyethylene and chlorinated polypropylene), polymethacrylic acid alkyl esters or alkenyl esters (in particular polymethyl (meth)acrylate, polyethyl (meth)acrylate, polybutyl (meth)acrylate, polyisobutyl (meth)acrylate, polyhexyl (meth)acrylate, poly(2-ethylhexyl) (meth)acrylate and polyalkyl (meth)acrylate copolymers of (meth) acrylic acid alkyl esters or alkenyl esters with other copolymerizable monomers (in particular with (met)acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, styrene and/or butadiene), polyvinyl chloride (PVC, vinylchloride/(meth)acrylonitrile copolymers, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), vinylidene chloride/(meth)acrylonitrile copolymers, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, copolymers of vinyl pyrrolidone or alkylated vinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl caprolactam, copolymers of vinyl caprolactam, poly (meth)acrylonitrile, (meth)acrylonitrile/styrene copolymers, (meth)acrylamide/alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymers, (meth)acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS) terpolymers, polystyrene, poly(\u03b1-methylstyrene), polyamides, polyurthanes, polyesters, methyl cellulose, ethylcellulose, acetyl cellulose, hydroxy-(C1-C4-alkyl) cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl formal and polyvinyl butyral. Particulary preferred binders are polymers having vinylcaprolactam, vinylpyrrolidone or alkylated vinylpyrrolidone as monomeric units. Alkylated vinylpyrrolidone polymers can be obtained by grafting alfa-olefines onto the vinylpyrrolidone polymer backbone. Typical examples of such products are the Agrimer AL Graft polymers commercially available from ISP. The length of the alkylation group may vary from C4 to C30. Other useful binders are binders containing carboxyl groups, in particular copolymers containing monomeric units of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carboxylic acids or monomeric units of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated dicarboxylic acids (preferably acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, vinylacetic acid, maleic acid or itaconic acid). By the term \u201ccopolymers\u201d are to be understood in the context of the present invention as polymers containing units of at least 2 different monomers, thus also terpolymers and higher mixed polymers. Particular examples of useful copolymers are those containing units of (meth)acrylic acid and units of alkyl (meth)acrylates, allyl (meth)acrylates and/or (meth)acrylonitrile as well as copolymers containing units of crotonic acid and units of alkyl (meth)acrylates and/or (meth)acrylonitrile and vinylacetic acid/alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymers. Also suitable are copolymers containing units of maleic anhydride or maleic acid monoalkyl esters. Among these are, for example, copolymers containing units of maleic anhydride and styrene, unsaturated ethers or esters or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons and the esterification products obtained from such copolymers. Further suitable binders are products obtainable from the conversion of hydroxyl-containing polymers with intramolecular dicarboxylic anhydrides. Further useful binders are polymers in which groups with acid hydrogen atoms are present, some or all of which are converted with activated isocyanates. Examples of these polymers are products obtained by conversion of hydroxyl-containing polymers with aliphatic or aromatic sulfonyl isocyanates or phosphinic acid isocyanates. Also suitable are polymers with aliphatic or aromatic hydroxyl groups, for example copolymers containing units of hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, allyl alcohol, hydroxystyrene or vinyl alcohol, as well as epoxy resins, provided they carry a sufficient number of free OH groups. Particular useful binder and particular useful reactive binders are disclosed in EP 1 369 232, EP 1 369 231, EP 1 341 040, U.S. 2003/0124460, EP 1 241 002, EP 1 288 720, U.S. Pat.

All the plates show an excellent clean-out. The plates were than printed on a GTO-46 press with K+E 800 ink and Agfa Prima FS101 fountain and a compressible blanket. A run length of >1000 prints on offset paper were printed. The sensitivity was measured as the minimum energy at which a non-degraded, sharp printed image was visible at 1000 pages. In these experiments, the Dmax>1.5 and the Dmin=0.0. Results are shown in table 16., 112049=According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the photopolymerizable coating comprises a top layer which acts as an oxygen barrier layer. Preferred binders which can be used in the top layer are polyvinyl alcohol and the polymers disclosed in EP-A-3103498, filed on Sep. 22, 2003, U.S. Pat. No. 6,410,205 and EP 1 288 720, including the cited references in these patents and patent applications. The coating thickness of the top layer is preferably between 0.10 and 2.0 g/m2, more preferably between 0.20 and 1.5 g/m2, most preferably between 0.25 and 1.0 g/m2. In another embodiment, the top layer may comprise a film-forming hydrophilic polymer or surfactant, optionally the other compounds of the gum solution as mentioned above., 57363=Printing masters are generally obtained by the so-called computer-to-film (CtF) method, wherein various pre-press steps such as typeface selection, scanning, color separation, screening, trapping, layout and imposition are accomplished digitally and each color selection is transferred to graphic arts film using an image-setter. After processing, the film can be used as a mask for the exposure of an imaging material called plate precursor and after plate processing, a printing plate is obtained which can be used as a master. Since about 1995, the so-called \u2018computer-to-plate\u2019 (CtP) method has gained a lot of interest. This method, also called \u2018direct-to-plate\u2019, bypasses the creation of film because the digital document is transferred directly to a printing plate precursor by means of a so-called plate-setter. A printing plate precursor for CtP is often called a digital plate., 92560=The photopolymerizable layer may also comprise a co-initiator. Typically, a co-initiator is used in combination with a free radical initiator and/or cationic initator. Particular co-initiators for use in the photopolymer coating are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,410,205, 5,049,479, EP 1079276, 1369232, EP 1369231 EP 1341040, U.S. 2003/0124460, EP 1241002, EP 1288720 and in the reference book including the cited refences: Chemistry & Technology UV & EB formulation for coatings, inks & paints-Volume 3-Photoinitiators for Free Radical and Cationic Polymerisation by K.
