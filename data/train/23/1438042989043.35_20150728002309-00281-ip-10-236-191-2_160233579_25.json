Mr. Mort was born in Page County, Iowa. When about 11 years old his mother died, and shortly thereafter his father and family came to this County, where the decedent has lived since, except for a few months in Oklahoma in search of health. On April 21, 1897 he was married to Addie Teal of near Utica, Iowa, who survived him. To this union were born two children, Leo, aged fifteen, and Maude, aged eight years. On Christmas day 1907, Mr. Mort and his brother-in-law J. H. Teal, were out hunting and the gun carried by him was accidently discharged and the load struck Mr. Teal in the ankle. The shock from this accident was so great to the nervous system that, within a few days, he was so nervous that he was unable to do any work, and has gradually grown worse since that time. On or about September, 1913, he was compelled to take his bed and has been an invalid ever since. During all his sickness he was a patient sufferer, never uttering a word of complaint, and retained great hope for his recovery until within a few days of his death. In 1912 he was elected county recorder, but was never able to take up active control of the office. In addition to his wife and two children, he leaves to mourn his death his father, step-mother, three sisters and one brother and many other relatives and also a host of admiring friends and neighbors. He was a member of the Methodist church and of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and was also a member of the order of Knights of Pythias.

On April 21, 1897 he was married to Addie Teal of near Utica, Iowa, who survived him. To this union were born two children, Leo, aged fifteen, and Maude, aged eight years. On Christmas day 1907, Mr. Mort and his brother-in-law J. H. Teal, were out hunting and the gun carried by him was accidently discharged and the load struck Mr. Teal in the ankle. The shock from this accident was so great to the nervous system that, within a few days, he was so nervous that he was unable to do any work, and has gradually grown worse since that time. On or about September, 1913, he was compelled to take his bed and has been an invalid ever since. During all his sickness he wa a patient sufferer, never uttering a word of complaint, and retained great hope for his recovery until within a few days of his death. In 1912 he was elected county recorder, but was never able to take up active control of the office. In addition to his wife and two children, he leaves to mourn his death his father, step-mother, three sisters and one brother and many other relatives and also a host of admiring friends and neighbors. He was a member of the Methodist church and of the Independent order of Odd Fellows, and was also a member of the order of Knights of Pythias. Brief funeral services were held at the residence Sunday, April 12 at 10:30 a.m. in charge of Rev. Behrens from whence the body was taken to the Miller Chapel near the birthplace of Mrs. Mort, where the services were held in the church, conducted by Rev. Bowles of Stockport, following which the body was buried in hands of Odd Fellows in the church cemetery., 104309=David William Mort, Date of Birth: November 02, 1963, Death Date: September 11, 1986, Sex: Male, Race: White, Age: 22 Years, Place of Occurance: , Jackson, North Carolina, Place of Residence: .

Of recent years much of her time being spent in the home of her niece, Mrs. Floyd Kerr, who was to Aunt Jennie as a loving daughter. \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd After finishing the rural school work, she attended the Keosauqua high school and was later a student at the Troy academy, and often referred to the joys of school life and the friendships formed while there. \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd When a young girl of 14 years, Jennie gave her heart to God and consecrated her life to his service, uniting with the M.E. church at Pittsburg and remaining a faithful member of this church until the close of life. \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd About 6 years ago she suffered a great affliction in the loss of her sight and while she felt this loss keenly, she was never heard to murmur or complain and bore her affliction with a submission and calmness that was characteristic of her life. During her last illness she expressed her thankfulness that she had made her peace with God while in health and assured her friend that she was ready and willing to go to the Father. \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd She leaves five brothers to mourn the loss of a loving sister. Christian of Portland, Oregon, Joseph of Rialto, California, Aaron of Hill City, Kansas, and William and James of this county. These brothers with their families and many neighbors and friends while feeling a personal loss, will cherish the memory of one, who with Christian sympathy and love, helped to smooth the rough places of life, make the dark places less gloomy and the bright spots more cheerful. Her life patterned after the perfect life of Christ, has been indeed beautiful. \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Funeral services were held at Pittsburg, conducted by Rev. Amsmuth.
