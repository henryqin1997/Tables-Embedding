Everyone has the same lunch break at either 12:00 or 12:15 pm; all the students sit together, or can even join their professors! What\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s the best part? You can take your lunch out by the pond, and sit in the sun. The pond is beautiful, relaxing, and very popular due to its scenery and the mood it provides. The food is delicious, and they have just about anything you could think of- pizza, salads, fries, fruit, wraps, you name it. Breakfast in the morning is convenient, if you are on a tight budget because they prices are a bargain!}",

    "textAfterTable": "I decided to start with a smaller campus, a student body about as large as that of my Philadelphia Public High School. I will have the ability to eventually go to University Park (if i want) and move up to a campus that is as big as a small city! Or, if I so desire, I can stay at Abington for 4 years and earn a full baccalaureate degree in many majors, without leaving home. The campus is in a beautiful rural setting, is not too big, and makes every day a delight. There are both old and new buildings and people who are always willing to help you. A bookstore on campus, as well as a full cafeteria in the Student Union Building and a snack-serving lounge in the Science Building, along with a full and well stocked library. A very relaxing place to spend my time between classes. Am learning a lot I have just started and have already learned so much, that my horizons have completely changed. The teachers are so good, and so involved with their subjects and students, that they have started a fire in me which has caused me to re-think my goals and expand my horizons. I am now undecided as to my future, but I have many good people to help me on my way, and I know my future is brighter!",
