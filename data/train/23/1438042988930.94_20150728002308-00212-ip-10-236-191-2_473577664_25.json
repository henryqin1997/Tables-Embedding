A BIAcore 2000 (manufactured by BIAcore) was used as an SPR measuring device. A gold-deposited glass substrate SIA-kit Au of the same company was used as a gold substrate to which the fraction was to be bound. Measurement was performed under the following conditions. 500 nM (calculated from the absorbance as described above) of the protein fraction obtained in Example 37 were used as a sample.

Next, about 400 bp of PCR fragments were obtained from the gel through rough purification by using a gel extraction kit (Promega). The sequence confirmed that the fragments had a target base sequence. (c) pUT-scFv (7s4) and the PCR fragments obtained in (b) above were cleaved by using NotI/SacII. Next, agarose electrophoresis was performed to purify the target fragments on each of a Vector side and an Insert side. (d) The purified nucleic acid fragments obtained in (c) above were mixed at a ratio of Vector:Insert=1:5, and then a ligation reaction was performed in the same manner as in Example 1., 184596=No. 11:4.9\ufffd109 cfu, 26838=On the other hand, proteins that function as enzymes, antibodies, or the like have high molecular weights. Thus, it is very difficult to chemically synthesize such compounds having high molecular weights to form higher order structures while keeping abilities to exert their functions. Although a variety of studies have been currently conducted, the situation is that functional proteins that combine their higher order structures with desired functions have not been synthesized yet in most cases (Science, 302: p. 1364, 2003). When the functional protein is immobilized on a substrate material, binding with the substrate is generally performed by treating the substrate with a variety of surface treatment agents typified by a silane coupling agent, and introducing into the protein a functional group capable of binding to the surface of the substrate that was subjected to surface treatment (Proteomics, 3: p. 254, 2003). However, it has been pointed out that such introduction of a reactive functional group into the functional protein is generally performed by chemical modification and an introduction site is nonselectively determined. Therefore, the functional protein is immobilized in a less functionable shape on the substrate and may be reduced in the resulting activity due to the modification of the functional expression site of the functional protein., 307988=As the result, the signal of bond HEL molecule was 11 R. U., while that of antibody immobilized on gold substrate was 1907 R. U. Considering of configuration at immobilization and assuming that a single antibody molecule captured one antigen on a substrate, the rate of antibodies captured target substances was calculated to be about 6%., 184350=No. 7:6.2\ufffd109 cfu, 196982=No. 1:3.8\ufffd109 cfu, 184411=No. 8:8.9\ufffd107 cfu, 99134=The term \u201cdissociation constant (KD)\u201d refers to a value obtained by dividing a \u201cbinding rate (Ka)\u201d by a \u201cdissociation rate (kd)\u201d value. Those rates may be used as indexes that represent the affinity of the monoclonal antibody or a fragment thereof to gold. The rates can be analyzed according to any of various methods. In the present invention, however, the rates are determined from a binding curve using a measuring device, Biacore2000 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Co., Ltd.) according to an analysis software bundled on the device., 44443=Next, a method of labeling antibodies by a chemical bond method will be described. Antibodies have the amino groups or SH groups of proteins. A functional group reactive with those groups is previously provided in a labeling agent to thereby allow the chemical bond between a labeling agent such as a fluorescent substance and a substance to be labeled such as an antibody. An example of the method includes a method involving introducing a labeling agent having an N-hydroxysuccinimide group, an isothiocyanate group, a nitroaryl halide group, or an acid chloride group, which reacts with an amino group. N-hydroxysuccininide that is widely used as a crosslinking agent for labeling proteins is known to efficiently react with an amino group under a pH atmosphere of 7 or more and form a highly stable amide bond (Biochemistry, Vol. 11, pp. 2291, 1972). The amino groups of the \u03b1 position and of the \u03b5 position of lysine side chain on a protein can be targeted by a succinimide group in reaction. In particular, an amino group at the \u03b5 position is considered to be the general target of succinimide. For example, when a gold fine particle as a labeling agent is chemically bound to a protein such as an antibody, the gold fine particle is first modified with a compound having at least a SH group at one end and a functional group highly reactive with the above-described side chain residue of a protein at another end. Next, the protein can be crosslinked with the reactive functional group to bind them. However, because a residue having lysine or a free \u03b1-amino group nonselectively becomes a subject of interest in reaction in those methods, a protein to be labeled such as an antibody may be inhibited in its function. Although FITC is also known as a fluorescent substance having an isothiocyanate group, like succinimide, the desired property of a protein to be labeled may be reduced due to nonspecific reaction to an amino group., 197594=No. 11:4.9\ufffd109 cfu, 197531=No. 10:1.1\ufffd1010 cfu, 184533=No. 10:1.1\ufffd1010 cfu, 198152=No. 20:1.1\ufffd1010 cfu, 197043=No. 2:9.0\ufffd108 cfu, 68034=The obtained antibody may be polyclonal and is, however, given as a monoclonal antibody to thereby allow the selection of a clone having high specificity for gold. The monoclonal antibody can be obtained by cloning a cell producing it. In general, an immunoglobulin-forming cell such as the splenocyte collected from an immunized animal is fused to a tumor cell to thereby allow the formation of a hybridoma (Gulfre G., Nature 266. 550-552, 1977). For example, tumor cells include myeloma cells such as a mouse-derived myeloma P3/X63-AG8. 653 (ATCC No. CRL-1580), P3/NSI/1-Ag4-1 (NS-1), P3/X63-Ag8.

A BIAcore 2000 (manufactured by BIAcore) was used as an SPR measuring device. A gold-deposited glass substrate SIA-kit Au of the same company was used as a gold substrate (to which the fraction was to be bound). Measurement was performed under the following conditions. 500 nM (calculated from the absorbance as described above) of the dimerized protein fraction obtained in Example 15 were used as a sample., 197842=No. 15:9.7\ufffd107 cfu, 197409=No. 8:8.9\ufffd107 cfu, 197780=No. 14:1.0\ufffd109 cfu, 286696=Substitution was performed in such a manner that a protein fused with HEL-binding scFv (SEQ ID No: 143 or 144) instead of HEL-binding VH of Example 31 was obtained. DNA fragments encoding HEL-binding scFv was obtained by PCR with a plasmid to which an HEL-binding scFv coding gene was introduced, show in Journal of Biological chemistry, 2003, 279, pp 8979, as a template. PCR was performed in accordance with the same method as that recommended by one skilled in the art, and the following primers were used., 183984=No. 1:3.8\ufffd109 cfu, 197718=No. 13:2.4\ufffd109 cfu, 184106=No. 3:2.4\ufffd109 cfu, 198028=No. 18:8.9\ufffd107 cfu, 40574=Studies are being conducted, in which a protein having a scaffold similar to that of the above-described antibody is added with the ability to recognize diverse molecules. Examples thereof include anticolin (Review in Molecular Biotechnology, 74: p. 257, 2001) and a fibronectin type III domain (J. Mol. Biol, 284: p. 1141, 1998). Anticolin is a capture protein altered on the basis of lipocalin. Lipocalin is a protein composed of 160 to 180 amino residues, which functions in transporting and storing substances with a low degree of solubility in water. Regarding constitution, lipocalin is a barrel structure composed of 8 \u03b2 sheets. Lipocalin can recognize and bind to a substance of interest through 4 loop structures connecting the 8 \u03b2 sheets. Fibronectin is generally a protein composed of amino acids not more than 100 residues, which plays a key role in the junction of cells with extracellular matrix or cell junction. Like the two proteins described above, fibronectin is a protein that has \u03b2 sheet structures and recognizes a target substance through loop structures among the \u03b2 sheets. A novel binding protein has been constructed by introducing random amino acid sequences into the loop structures among the \u03b2 sheets of anticolin or fibronectin described above. Because those molecules have a strong molecular structure composed of \u03b2 sheets in addition to a molecular recognition site, the molecules specifically recognize and bind to a substrate by the fusion to a desired functional polymeric material to thereby allow the polymeric material to be immobilized on the substrate. Moreover, the molecules are also expected to have a spacer function that keeps a certain distance from the substrate without inhibiting the desired activity of the immobilized polymeric material. However, there has been no reported case that molecule-recognizing proteins with constitutively stable scaffolds typified by the above-described antibody specifically recognize and bind to inorganic substances typified by metals or semiconductor materials., 184289=No. 6:4.4\ufffd108 cfu, 307404=(2) Injecting 100 \u03bcl of the solution obtained (1) at 1 \u03bcl/min. The signal of absorbed antibody was 1907 R. U., 198090=No. 19:1.4\ufffd109 cfu, 184228=No. 5:9.7\ufffd107 cfu, 184045=No. 2:9.0\ufffd108 cfu, 37905=Skerra and Better disclose a method in which Fab-type and Fv-type antibody fragments, the N terminals of which are added with a secretion signal sequence by a genetic engineering method, are produced as the expression of antibody genes by E. coli (Science, 240: P. 1038, 1988; Science, 240: p. 1041, 1988). Alternatively, JP 07-501451 A discloses a multivalent antigen-binding antibody and a method of producing the same, and JP 08-504100 A discloses a multivalent and multibinding antibody and a method of producing the same. Those two techniques disclose that a binding protein is a protein containing an antibody variable region portion (VH and/or VL) binding to one or more antigens. JP 07-501451 discloses the structures and amino acid sequences of binding proteins each recognizing pancarcinoma antigen TAG-72 and fluorescein and a bispecific antibody recognizing both, as well as base sequences encoding them. JP 08-504100 A discloses, in Examples, a divalent and bispecific binding protein composed of an antibody fragment complex for known proteins (cell membrane protein, cancer antigen CEA, FcR\u03b31, etc.,) or low molecular compounds., 197904=No. 16:4.4\ufffd108 cfu, 197165=No. 4:1.0\ufffd109 cfu, 191834=The binding affinity of the VL protein obtained in Example 6 for gold was measured by means of SPR. A BIAcore 2000 (manufactured by BIAcore) was used as an SPR measuring device. A gold-deposited glass substrate SIA-kit Au of the same company was used as a gold substrate to which the protein was to be bound., 158103=A 96-well titer plate on which gold (having a thickness of 100 nm) was deposited was prepared as a substrate for screening of a gold-binding antibody heavy chain variable region (VH). 250 \u03bcL of 1,000 sample solutions obtained in Example 1 were dispensed in each well, and the plate was gently shaken for 1 hour. After the supernatant had been discarded, the plate was turned upside down and was tapped on paper towel 10 times to remove water. A washing step was performed, which involved: adding 200 \u03bcL of Tris+0.1% Tween 20 to each well; and gently shaking the plate for 10 minutes. This operation was repeated 3 times. 200 \u03bcL of an antibody solution prepared by diluting an HRP-binding anti-His antibody (Invitrogen) with Tris+0.1% Tween 20 solution at 1:10,000 were dispensed in each well, and the plate was gently shaken for 1 hour. Subsequently, the same operation as the washing step was performed. 100 \u03bcL of each of an HRP substrate and Detect Reagents 1 and 2 (Amasham Science) serving as coloring materials were dispensed in each well, and the plate was gently shaken for 1 hour. The luminol chemiluminescence level was determined., 311286=This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-108388 filed Mar. 31, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein., 24699=Under the circumstances, research and development have been actively conducted on novel materials by means of a bottom-up approach that produces desired structures and properties controlled at the atomic or molecular level, instead of conventional top-down processing technology. An example of bottom-up technology of producing refined structures includes the development of a molecular device in which a molecular arrangement is controlled on a metal surface, and the use of methods of utilizing the self-assembly of substances has been studied as one of such technologies of molecular arrangement control. As a recent example of the study, Lindsay et al., (Science, 300: p. 1413, 2003) has examined a molecular switching function by the use of a self-assembled monolayer where alkanethiol and alkanedithiol having thiol groups at their respective molecular ends are oriented on a gold substrate., 197226=No. 5:9.7\ufffd107 cfu, 197287=No. 6:4.4\ufffd108 cfu, 197348=No. 7:6.2\ufffd109 cfu}",
