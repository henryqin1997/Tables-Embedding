I have no major issue with any of the requirements, but am voting to reject this as it seems like advice to authors and organizations rather than something the HTML WG needs to consider when developing the technical solutions. The exception might be (PP-2), but the metadata issue has also been mentioned in other requirements, so there's no need to repeat it.",

(AD-11) Support the simultaneous playback of both the described and non-described audio tracks so that one may be directed at separate outputs (e.g., a speaker and headphones). (AD-10) Allow the user to select from among different languages of descriptions, if available, even if they are different from the language of the main soundtrack.

    "textAfterTable": "2. Texted Audio Description Refer to 2.2 Texted Audio Description. Audio descriptions that are given as text rather than recorded voice create specific requirements. Texted audio descriptions are delivered to the client as text and rendered locally by e.g. a screen-reader or through a braille device. This can have advantages for users who are frequent screen-reader users and are thus given detailed control of the preferred voice and speaking rate, and many more options to control the speech synthesis. Texted audio descriptions are provided as text files with a start time for a description cue. Since the duration that a screenreader takes to read out a description cue cannot be determined during authoring of the cues, it is difficult to make sure they don't run over into the main audio or into other description cues. This is likely to be caused by at least three reasons: A typical author of textual audio descriptions does not have a screen reader. This means s/he cannot check if the description fist within the time frame. Even if s/he has a screen reader, a different screen reader may take longer to read out the same sentence; Some screen reader users (e.g. elderly and people with learning disabilities) may slow down the speech rate; or A visually-complicated scene (e.g. figures on a blackboard in an online physics class) may not be sufficiently described within any time",
