            "I suggest looking at RateMyProfessor.com while searching for a teacher. The website will help students to see how that teacher teaches. Some students prefer certain techniques so that website is a good source. It is also important to stay on top of the homework and class work. In college you do not always get homework, but that does not mean that you should go home and do nothing. It is important to read the book and sometimes teach yourself and ask the professor to cover things that you do not understand.",

It is better than going to a big school and paying thousands of dollars for what JJC offers at maybe two thousand, and that is a high price at our school. Average is about $1500 dollars a semester., 96675=The food is good, but it can be a little expensive. They offer many choices of food. You can consider sub sandwiches, the grill station, healthy foods, grab-n-go items, salad bar and vending. You can also choose smoothies, hot chocolate, coffee and many other drinks. The cafeteria is clean and new. It's a great spot to hang out with friends and to have lunch. You can also dine outside in our picnic area. The cafeteria stay open from 7 am - 7 pm Monday - Thursday. On Fridays it stays open from 7am - 2:30 pm., 95993=There are many fun and exciting activities to get involved in.

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students JJC offers something for almost everyone. It is particularly great for students who want to save a bit of money before heading off to four-year colleges. It is also great for adults who want to return back to school- there is a wide range of age groups at JJC, so adult learners would not feel out of place. JJC is also good for those that quit, or did not do well the last time they were in school. JJC's open admission policy makes this school a good choice for those looking to give school a second chance and turn their education around. Tips for prospective students I mentioned earlier that I did not learn much from some of my classes. I noticed that the classes from which I did not learn much were usually general education courses, that all students needed to take in order to fulfill their degree requirements. If you want to learn a lot from your general education courses, I would recommend taking the more unique ones that most students do not take. It seems like the more popular classes are made easier, so that more students can pass them. I would also recommend getting involved in things right away.
