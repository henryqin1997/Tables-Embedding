InMotion Hosting is definitely worth checking out. Note: If you are planning to run more than 2 MySQL Databases or host multiple domains, you will want to consider the Power or Pro plan. InMotion also offers Dedicated, VPS, Managed and Reseller Hosting to accommodate for your growing online needs. Check out the host that\u2019s been CNET Certified since 2003 and has an A+ with the Better Business Bureau., 110589=ServerMania's basic level offering is a single processor Intel Xeon E3-1240 v3, 3.4 GHz. It touts a quad-core with 16 GB DDR3 RAM, 1 TB SATA or 120 GB SSD storage and 10 TB of bandwidth. This base set up should be ample if you are just making the jump to dedicated service and are looking to keep your costs down. The 1TB SATA or 120 GB SSD storage, 5 public IP addresses and 10TB of bandwidth is a standard feature across all of their offerings., 53831=With such a wide variety of hosting options it\u2019s easy to see how Arvixe really is the jack of hosting. Since 2003 Arvixe has been offering reseller web-hosting services to designers\u2026, 57076=With such a wide variety of hosting options it\u2019s easy to see how Arvixe really is the jack of hosting. Since 2003 Arvixe has been offering reseller web-hosting services to designers, developers and entrepreneurs alike, all across the globe., 30513=(mt) Media Temple has a bit of a higher price point for their service, but one can certainly justify it. They implement their Grid Technology with SSDs, and built-in redundancy. They also measure usage based on GPU cycles vs CPU cycles. This means that you will not get shut down for large or abnormal spikes in traffic. They will just bill for any overages. The allotment of 2000 GPU's should be more than enough for your average business site to not have to worry about overage., 50762=InMotion offers free consultations where you are under no obligation to buy, ultimately helping you make the best educated decision about your next business move. With little comparison in packages you can choose any reseller option and be truly supported and covered through the life of your hosting business. The largest downfall is the top reseller package; the R-3000 is the only option that offers the launch assist. For a one off $99 fee we highly recommend that you take advantage of this add on and go with either the R-1000 or 2000 package. With InMotion\u2019s outstanding 24/7 customer support it\u2019s a clear no brainer.}",
