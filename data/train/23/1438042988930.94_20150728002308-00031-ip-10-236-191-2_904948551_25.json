            "They are always patrolling the area and you can call them anytime for help.",
            "This is not as big as other schools and the girls cannot have a house off campus, but they are still close and fun to be in and get people involved and the frats are fun to dance at.",
            "There are a lot of clubs and if they dont have your club you can start one along with intermurral sports teams.",
            "This is good for student athletes, the teachers are really understanding of the schedules athletes have to maintain during season.",
            "This school is really into sports, get involved!",
            "They offer a lot of great scholarships especially if you play sports. To go to a private school you will get a lot for a little amount.",
            "The frats are always having something on the weekends which is always a fun thing to do after a long week of classes. But there is also sports and a great sports center being built.",
            "The food is horrible the only good thing is the snacks and the fact that they put a subway in last year.",
            "You get to know a lot of great people when you live in the dorms. They are very close together and are welcoming, you can style your room up however you like.",
            "The teachers are extremly well educated and care about what they are teaching and do not use teachers assistants so you are learning first hand.",
            "If you are planning to go here and you live far away from this school, your first year may be hard to adjust and get home sick a lot, bring a car!",
            "This school has a great amount of history that it likes to take pride in. It is also happy to help the community of Detroit and get students involved with community service projects. There are a lot of very well educated teachers here that care for the students."

The annoying part are the hours the dining hall is open on the weekends. Very ridiculous it doesn't open until 10:30, but we are used to getting up on weekdays by 8:00. Two and a half hours without food in the morning makes me nausea. And way less choices on the weekends. I feel bad for the kids from out of state who are stuck here every weekend!}",
