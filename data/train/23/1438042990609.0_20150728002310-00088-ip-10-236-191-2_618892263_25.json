            "Each raw data source was converted into ESRI ArcGIS formats. The resulting files were converted and adjusted to predetermined projection (geographic), horizontal datum (NAD27), and vertical datum (MHW) using the ArcInfo PROJECT command and ArcView Spatial Analyst MAP CALCULATOR algorithm. A polyline shapefile was created to represent the coastline. The coastline is a culmination of USGS hydrographic vectors. A TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) was created using bathymetric data point and coastline points using ArcInfo CREATETIN. An 8-second grid was created using TINLATTICE. The data was assessed for quality using ArcView Spatial Analyst. The grid was compared to its raw dataset. The 8-second grid was clipped to requested coordinates. Data were assessed for quality by comparing with original sources, corresponding sources, and control data. Continuity between old and new data were assessed and errors were corrected. The final grid was analyzed for blunders, systematic errors, and logical consistency.",
