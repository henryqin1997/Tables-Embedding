            "Eckerd is protected by water on three sides and there is only one entrance into campus. The guards are extremely nice, even giving out candy on Halloween. Its very safe here, just really the occasional stingray stab.",
            "There is no Greek life at Eckerd",
            "At Eckerd, as long as you have a sponsor, a plan, and a couple of students, you can create any club you want. Eckerd is very relaxed and sometimes works on island time, so if you are really interested in something, it's up to you to go find it and do it.",
            "Eckerd is great for water-loving people. It's open and carefree. For the price, you need to be academically driven and willing to work. Their Marine Science program is top notch and well known.",
            "It has a waterfront. Free for Eckerd students, you can rent kayaks, canoes, paddleboards, and floats to play in the bay. Also, there are sailing classes and the occasional wakeboarding trips.",
            "It is very expensive. So its not for the people who just want to do the minimum and party. This college is for people serious about their careers. If you really dive into the academic side of Eckerd, it'll be worth the money.",
            "10 minutes in one direction leads to the beautiful St. Pete beach and farther down are more white sand beaches. In the other direction is the bustling city of St. Petersburg and a little bit farther is Tampa. The possibilities are endless, but honestly, with a beach right on Eckerd campus, you'll be hard pressed to leave campus.",
            "There are two choices: the caf\u00c3\u00a9 and the pub. From salads to Chinese food, The caf\u00c3\u00a9 has a variety of selections for all sorts of people. At the pub, the meal is cooked right in front of you. I recommend the turkey melt; its delicious.",
            "The RAs are known for their caring attitude. Eckerd knows that its students like to have fun and hosts many parties and events, such as free tickets to movies and baseball games.",
            "Especially for Marine Science, their courses can be quite difficult. Despite the long hours and heavy coursework, professors and fellow students are always available to help.",
            "Start scholarship hunting way early. Kappa dorm has many frequent parties, so if you're a studious person, its not for you.",
            "Eckerd College is expensive, but well worth the money if you can afford it. The professors and staff are always available. The science department is well known for their hands-on research, even for freshman."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{145698=Compared to bigger schools, Eckerd's food choices are rather limited. We have one main cafeteria that is open select hours of the day (weekdays: 7:30 am to 9:45 am, 11:30 am to 1:30 pm, and 5:00 pm to 7:15 pm). We also have Triton's pub which also has it's own select hours that it is open (weekdays: 9 am to 10pm) and a much more limited selection of food. There is an additional cafeteria with less variety, but better quality food than the other dining facilities, however it is far from the residential side of campus and has more restricted hours as well. The food is in general mediocre because they use the same vegetables and other supplies to make a variety of foods. Although it does get somewhat repetitive, there are some days when the food is above average & dining comes up with some kind of a surprise for us., 146811=Dorm life is developed to a great extent in Autumn Term, but in reality things change significantly once the upper upperclassmen return in September. The RAs do a decent job of getting their residents & houses to connect with each other with dorm and complex events they organize. Each dorm has its own personality and it's easy enough to find one that matches your personality., 130857=I think this is a great school. There are so many opportunities for research. Our guide had done 4 study abroads-all very cool ones. You can go every January and also in May for a month, or you can do a semester or a whole year. The professor who's class I went to does a UN trip (he used to work there), he does a trip to the Hague and also the UN in NYC. You can also do a service abroad trips--our guide went to Iceland and helped clear some paths and other conservation projects. It's supposedly pretty easy to get financing for the trips. Also, you can go to Cuba, which is cool--I would definitely want to do that. I like the yellow bikes, when I came for the bbq by myself, I got lost and it was super handy to be able to ride around on the bike till I found everyone., 116373=Very safe, no one is allowed to come on campus without your campus ID after 6 o'clock., 235016=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Eckerd is a small liberal arts college on the water with a reputation for sending graduates straight into jobs, internships, and prestigious graduate schools. This is because the professors and classes (small usually around 12-25 students) are designed not only to provide expected information on areas of interest, but to build skills that help students to think differently about their place in the world. Once you get past the intro-level courses which are pretty basic in any college, you can enroll in classes that are more interesting and engaging. Like any school you attend, you get out of it what you put in. So if you prefer a smaller, more fun and intimate college where you can form close relationships with peers and professors, and if you utilize the resources the school provides, then you can definitely gain an education that matches your goals and helps you succeed.
