A.5.20 OdiImportObject Use this command to import the contents of an export file into a repository. This command reproduces the behavior of the import feature available from the user interface. Be careful when using this tool. It may work incorrectly when importing objects that depend on objects that do not exist in the repository. It is recommended that you use this API for importing high-level objects (Projects, models, etc). WARNING: The import mode and the order in which objects are imported into a repository should be carefully specified. Refer to Chapter 19, \"Exporting/Importing\" for more information on import.
