The North Bank Road leads from the North Bank up towards Guadosalam. It is much shorter than the corresponding South Bank Road. North Bank RoadEdit Like the South Bank, the North Bank is a small area overlooking the waters of the Moonflow. In Final Fantasy X, Rikku may be found here. A chest with four Antidotes may be found to the right after Rikku's tutorial. North BankEdit In Final Fantasy X, a Save Sphere may be found in the section the party ends up at after riding the shoopuf. In the adjoining area, O'aka may be found, but he sells only items during this encounter. In the nearby waiting area, a treasure chest with an Ether may be found. The North Wharf is located on the opposite",
