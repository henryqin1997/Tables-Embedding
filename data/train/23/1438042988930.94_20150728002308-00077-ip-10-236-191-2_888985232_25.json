I love the faculty and staff members that work with me in my transition to graduation in 2015. Lord willing I will pass all my classes with an 4.0 GPA., 24608=i was past student here and this college in walking distance to my home. i had a great experience here and i am registered to go back and will be attending for the fall semester 2012,, 58846=In December 1993, the Always Amazing Alpha Alpha Phi Chapter was founded; after much yearning by the student body, there was finally Greek life on campus! Today, the fraternity is doing well in addition to yet another that was recently put in place, a fraternity who's name escapes me., 94585=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 60751=There aren\u00e2??t really any unusual traditions that I have observed during my years at Medgar, but one thing for sure is that the school is prided heavily on Black History Month as a celebration of Medgar Wiley Evers and all those who fought for civil rights, paving the way to even have an institution of higher learning for educating people of color. Yes, indeed, diversity is playing an important role at the college but it is still largely populated with African-Americans and Hispanics and so during the month of February, the schools loves to host talent shows and such to dedicate and commemorate of far we\u00e2??ve come. The whole process really is very cool. Additionally, there is also Black Solidarity Day. Created in back 1969 as a day nationally observed by African-American men, women and students, it always occurs the Monday before elections take place; this year it fell on the fourth of November. Originally, the event brought black people together to discuss their political status and the direction in which their future was going. The day also focused on the value and goals of education within the black community. It was, and still is, a day of discussion and a time for everyone, no matter of what race or education, to discuss how we all affect each other's lives. This year\u00e2??s theme was \u00e2??Understanding Trayvon Martin in the Age of the Obamas.\u00e2?? That was also one of the most touching events here on campus this year. I enjoyed partaking and fully recommend prospective students to do the same!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Great for fresh out of high school and those returning to school. Tips for prospective students If you are looking for a good college to start at, try a CUNY, but try Medgar Evers because not only is it affordable, but its a warm college. No pressure to dress a certain way and no fear because there is plenty of security. Bang for the buck The tuition is surprising cheap for a college in New York City. Financial aid covers most of my tuition which is a great help, but the average cost is very low. Great price for the lessons you learn here. Am enjoying being here The campus is beautiful and with the new building, the science classes with the new labs are amazing. The library is large and full of information for all my research papers. Am learning a lot CUNY Medgar Evers College has been such a helpful school in learning about not only college level courses, but what to expect from a college. The teachers here have no problem explaining until you understand. The staff is extremely friendly and encouraging.",
