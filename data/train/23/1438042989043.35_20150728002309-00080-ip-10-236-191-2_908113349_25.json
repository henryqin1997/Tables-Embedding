            "Only touch the Rider Rock once, otherwise you won't graduate! Also don't step on a certain quad of grass at Westminster, it's bad luck.",
            "It's worth the price, I wouldn't even consider another school.",
            "There is an endless amount of clubs and organizations to join as well as many intramural sports going on all the time.",
            "Daly's, Cranberry's, and Westminster Dining Commons were all just redone this summer, they're completely renovated.",
            "Entire buildings get cleaned every day, as long as you keep your own room clean the dorms are pretty nice.",
            "You will most likely never have a professor who does not have the highest degree in their field.",
            "Rider just updated their cable so make sure you have a QAM tuner in your tv and a co-axel cable. Also, classes are difficult but there is free tutoring and many professors have quite lengthy office hours, and all are willing to help.",
            "Rider is a great place to be with a strong community and sense of belonging for every student. The programs they have for each major are always growing and being improved upon as well as the campus itself. Rider is my home!"
