Although the days you won't want to miss are fried chicken Tuesdays, hotwing Thursdays, and spaghetti and fish Fridays! Also a burger king was recently put in place as the 2011-2012 academic year ended. In our union there is a chick fil-a, pizza hut, R.F.O.C. (great food, almost like soul food!). All these places I just named you are able to use your tiger bucks that come with your meal plan. Also there is a subway next to the union if you want to stay fit like the famous athletes!, 103491=The Plaza where everything happens. Listen to the bands march, Greek life, freshmen enjoy the plaza, 190475=Being that the University has placed strict rules regarding students safety (partially due to a large increase in the student population), majority of the rules are in place to protect us in general. To enter dorms, you have to swipe your ID card to unlock and gain access to your dormitory on campus. All visitors that you have are required to sign in with the front desk and are required to leave no later than 1:30 am. Else, you will risk losing visitation for the whole year. Although it is not what I was expecting, just like everyone else, I had to become used to the rules and it really isn't that bad., 121392=What I do for fun is hangout on the plaza with my friends, go to on campus events, and attend the hotspots every August at 1:00 pm to celebrate the start of the new school year., 264152=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 218386=It depends on the professor and the department. Some are more strict than others. Some teachers feel that the grammar and structure of an essay is the most important part; others feel that as long as you get the general idea, it's all good. So far my classes have been a mix of requirements.}",
