    "textBeforeTable": "Additionally, rain and thunderstorms are forecasted for the area Saturday (70 percent chance as of Thursday afternoon). Well, Alabama had a lot more with four interceptions, two for a touchdown, 328 rushing yards and handed Petrino his worst loss as a college head coach, 49-14. \"I think the last game they played, both sides had lots of big plays.\" \"When they get five times more yards throwing than they do running, you have to adapt and play a little bit more coverage and try and take away what they do best,\" Saban said. \"I think there is a balance in all that. I don't think you can compromise and just not be sound against the run and not have all the gaps, because they have two good runners now, and if you do that they are going to come out of the gate on you and they are good space players. I think you have to play the situations in the game, but I also think that you do have to emphasize coverage and be able to play the passes, especially so that you don't give up big plays. The bad news for Arkansas fans is that Alabama is better than Georgia, both offensively and defensively, and has a lot more depth. Consequently, that leaves one major concern for the Tide, Petrino's passing prowess. On the flip side, the defense has already yielded 31.0 points per game",
    "textAfterTable": "When Arkansas runs Running back Michael Smith was Arkansas' bright spot against Alabama last year, with 91 rushing yards and six receptions for 67 yards, but is having injury issues with a shoulder problem. \"He'll be good to go,\" said Petrino, who has some other options as the position. One thing Arkansas does very well is complete passes to running backs, who have nine catches for 84 yards this season (9.3 average), but the Razorbacks are last in the SEC in rushing yards and probably won't be able to do much on the ground against the Tide, which has given up just 1.52 yards per carry. \"We're going to play the same way we've been playing,\" sophomore linebacker Dont'a Hightower said. \"We're going to come into (the) game against Arkansas with the mentality that we can't let them run on us.\" Gone from last year's Razorbacks are standout center Jonathan Luigs, who won the 2007 Rimington Trophy, and Jose Valdez. It's your typical huge Arkansas line, everyone's 6-4, 315 pounds or bigger, but appears to be better in pass blocking than the run. When Arkansas passes Although Mallet is more than adept at throwing downfield, he's a pro-style quarterback who's not very mobile, playing his first Southeastern Conference road game. Alabama will likely bring pressure from a variety of different places and do everything it can to confuse the tall quarterback or at least make him",
