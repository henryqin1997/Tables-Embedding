The Commission seeks to develop a flexible and streamlined regulatory framework that will encourage efficient, innovative uses of the spectrum and to allow various services to operate on an interference-protected basis. In doing so, it further seeks to adopt service rules that will allow for the deployment of the various radar applications in this band, both within and outside the U.S. The Commission takes this action in response to a petition for rulemaking filed by Robert Bosch, LLC (Bosch) and two petitions for reconsideration of the 2012 Vehicular Radar R&O., 22179=On August 15, 2014, the Commission released a Report and Order, \u201cExpanding the Economic and Innovation Opportunities of Spectrum Through Incentive Auctions.\u201d This document announces an effective date for several sections in the final regulations that appeared in the Federal Register on August 15, 2014 (79 FR 48442)., 34564=Title 47 published on 2014-10-01, 13020=On April 1, 2014, the Commission released a Report and Order, \u201cUnlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) Devices in the 5 GHz Band.\u201d This document contains corrections to the final regulations for \u201cUnlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) Devices in the 5 GHz Band\u201d that appeared in the Federal Register on May 1, 2014 (79 FR 24569)., 33052=\u00a7 302 - Repealed.
