See, e.g., Duncan et al., 1988 Nature 332:563-64; Morgan et al., 1995 Immunology 86:319-24; Eghtedarzedeh-Kondri et al., 1997 Biotechniques 23:830-34. For example, mutation of the glycosylation site on the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin may alter the ability of the immunoglobulin to fix complement. See, e.g., Wright et al., 1997 Trends Biotechnol. 15:26-32. Other mutations in the constant region domains may alter the ability of the immunoglobulin to fix complement, or to effect antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. See, e.g., Duncan et al., 1988 Nature 332:563-64; Morgan et al., 1995 Immunology 86:319-24; Sensel et al., 1997 Mol. Immunol. 34:1019-29., 223600=Techniques for transforming fungi are well known in the literature and have been described, for instance, by Beggs (ibid.), Hinnen et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75:1929-1933, 1978), Yelton et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:1740-1747, 1984), and Russell (Nature 301:167-169, 1983). The genotype of the host cell may contain a genetic defect that is complemented by the selectable marker present on the expression vector. Choice of a particular host and selectable marker is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art., 232071=Within related aspects of the present invention, proteins of the present invention may be expressed in a transgenic animal whose germ cells and somatic cells contain a gene which encodes the desired protein and which is operably linked to a promoter effective for the expression of the gene. Alternatively, in a similar manner transgenic animals may be prepared that lack the desired gene (e.g., \u201cknock-out\u201d mice). Such transgenics may be prepared in a variety of non-human animals, including mice, rats, rabbits, sheep, dogs, goats, and pigs (see Hammer et al., Nature 315:680-683, 1985, Palmiter et al., Science 222:809-814, 1983, Brinster et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:4438-4442, 1985, Palmiter and Brinster, Cell 41:343-345, 1985, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,175,383, 5,087,571, 4,736,866, 5,387,742, 5,347,075, 5,221,778, and 5,175,384). Briefly, an expression vector, including a nucleic acid molecule to be expressed together with appropriately positioned expression control sequences, is introduced into pronuclei of fertilized eggs, for example, by microinjection. Integration of the injected DNA is detected by blot analysis of DNA from tissue samples. It is preferred that the introduced DNA be incorporated into the germ line of the animal so that it is passed on to the animal's progeny. Tissue-specific expression may be achieved through the use of a tissue-specific promoter, or through the use of an inducible promoter, such as the metallothionein gene promoter (Palmiter et al., 1983, supra), which allows regulated expression of the transgene., 149069=Peptide molecules which are putative inhibitors of the binding of TGF-beta binding-protein to a TGF-beta family member may be obtained through the screening of combinatorial peptide libraries. Such libraries may either be prepared by one of skill in the art (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,528,266 and 4,359,535, and Patent Cooperation Treaty Publication Nos. WO 92/15679, WO 92/15677, WO 90/07862, WO 90/02809, or purchased from commercially available sources (e.g., New England Biolabs Ph.D.\u2122 Phage Display Peptide Library Kit)., 289571=Polyclonal antibodies to each of the three antigens were produced in rabbit and in chicken hosts using standard protocols (R & R Antibody, Stanwood, Wash.; standard protocol for rabbit immunization and antisera recovery; Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd edition. 1992. 11.37-11.41. Contributors Helen M. Cooper and Yvonne Paterson; chicken antisera was generated with Strategic Biosolutions, Ramona, Calif.)., 19245=This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/399,210, filed Apr. 5, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,578,999 which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/463,190, filed Jun. 16, 2003 now abandoned. The contents of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 201275=In certain particular embodiments of the invention, combinatorial phage libraries may also be used for humanization of non-human variable regions. See, e.g., Rosok et al., 1996 J. Biol. Chem. 271:22611-18; Rader et al., 1998 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:8910-15. A phage library may be screened to select an Ig variable region fragment of interest by immunodetection methods known in the art and described herein, and the DNA sequence of the inserted immunoglobulin gene in the phage so selected may be determined by standard techniques. See, Sambrook et al., 2001 Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press. The selected Ig-encoding sequence may then be cloned into another suitable vector for expression of the Ig fragment or, optionally, may be cloned into a vector containing Ig constant regions, for expression of whole immunoglobulin chains., 193546=One such method for preparing a humanized antibody is called veneering. As used herein, the terms \u201cveneered FRs\u201d and \u201crecombinantly veneered FRs\u201d refer to the selective replacement of FR residues from, e.g., a rodent heavy or light chain V region, with human FR residues in order to provide a xenogeneic molecule comprising an antigen-binding site that retains substantially all of the native FR polypeptide folding structure. Veneering techniques are based on the understanding that the ligand binding characteristics of an antigen-binding site are determined primarily by the structure and relative disposition of the heavy and light chain CDR sets within the antigen-binding surface. Davies et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 59:439-73, 1990. Thus, antigen binding specificity can be preserved in a humanized antibody only wherein the CDR structures, their interaction with each other, and their interaction with the rest of the V region domains are carefully maintained. By using veneering techniques, exterior (e.g., solvent-accessible) FR residues that are readily encountered by the immune system are selectively replaced with human residues to provide a hybrid molecule that comprises either a weakly immunogenic, or substantially non-immunogenic veneered surface., 202739=In certain embodiments of the invention, an antibody specific for SOST may be an antibody that is expressed as an intracellular protein. Such intracellular antibodies are also referred to as intrabodies and may comprise an Fab fragment, or preferably comprise a scFv fragment (see, e.g., Lecerf et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:4764-49 (2001). The framework regions flanking the CDR regions can be modified to improve expression levels and solubility of an intrabody in an intracellular reducing environment (see, e.g., Worn et al., J. Biol. Chem. 275:2795-803 (2000). An intrabody may be directed to a particular cellular location or organelle, for example by constructing a vector that comprises a polynucleotide sequence encoding the variable regions of an intrabody that may be operatively fused to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a particular target antigen within the cell (see, e.g., Graus-Porta et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 15:1182-91 (1995); Lener et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 267:1196-205 (2000)). An intrabody may be introduced into a cell by a variety of techniques available to the skilled artisan including via a gene therapy vector, or a lipid mixture (e.g., Provectin\u2122 manufactured by Imgenex Corporation, San Diego, Calif.), or according to photochemical internalization methods., 197125=An additional method for selecting antibodies that specifically bind to a TGF-beta binding protein or variant or fragment thereof is by phage display. See, e.g., Winter et al., 1994 Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:433-55; Burton et al., 1994 Adv. Immunol. 57:191-280. Human or murine immunoglobulin variable region gene combinatorial libraries may be created in phage vectors that can be screened to select Ig fragments (Fab, Fv, sFv, or multimers thereof) that bind specifically to TGF-beta binding protein or variant or fragment thereof. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; William D. Huse et al., \u201cGeneration of a Large Combinational Library of the Immunoglobulin Repertoire in Phage Lambda,\u201d Science 246:1275-1281, December 1989; see also L. Sastry et al., \u201cCloning of the Immunological Repertoire in Escherichia coli for Generation of Monoclonal Catalytic Antibodies: Construction of a Heavy Chain Variable Region-Specific cDNA Library,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:5728-5732, August 1989; see also Michelle Alting-Mees et al., \u201cMonoclonal Antibody Expression Libraries: A Rapid Alternative to Hybridomas,\u201d Strategies in Molecular Biology 3:1-9, January 1990; Kang et al., 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:4363-66; Hoogenboom et al., 1992 J. Molec. Biol. 227:381-388; Schlebusch et al., 1997 Hybridoma 16:47-52 and references cited therein). A commercial system is available from Stratagene (La Jolla, Calif.) which enables the production of antibodies through recombinant techniques. Briefly, mRNA is isolated from a B cell population, and utilized to create heavy and light chain immunoglobulin cDNA expression libraries in the \u03bb ImmunoZap(H) and \u03bbImmunoZap(L) vectors. Positive plaques may subsequently be converted to a non-lytic plasmid which allows high level expression of monoclonal antibody fragments from E. coli. Alternatively, a library containing a plurality of polynucleotide sequences encoding Ig variable region fragments may be inserted into the genome of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or a variant thereof, in frame with the sequence encoding a phage coat protein. A fusion protein may be a fusion of the coat protein with the light chain variable region domain and/or with the heavy chain variable region domain. According to certain embodiments, immunoglobulin Fab fragments may also be displayed on a phage particle (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,426). These vectors may be screened individually or co-expressed to form Fab fragments or antibodies (see Huse et al., supra; see also Sastry et al., supra)., 202199=In certain other embodiments, the invention contemplates SOST-specific antibodies that are multimeric antibody fragments. Useful methodologies are described generally, for example in Hayden et al. 1997, Curr Opin. Immunol. 9:201-12; Coloma et al., 1997 Nat. Biotechnol. 15:159-63). For example, multimeric antibody fragments may be created by phage techniques to form miniantibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 5,910,573) or diabodies (Holliger et al., 1997, Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 45:128-130)., 360145=A FLAG\ufffd-sclerostin fusion protein was prepared according to protocols provided by the manufacturer (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) and as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,395,511. Each well of a 96 well microtiter plate is coated with anti-FLAG\ufffd monoclonal antibody (Sigma Aldrich) and then blocked with 10% BSA in PBS. The fusion protein (20 ng) is added to 100 \u03bcl PBS/0.2% BSA and adsorbed onto the 96-well plate for 60 minutes at room temperature. This protein solution is removed and the wells are washed to remove unbound fusion protein. A BMP, for example, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6, or BMP-7, is diluted in PBS/0.2% BSA and added to each well at concentrations ranging from 10 \u03bcM to 500 nM. After an incubation for 2 hours at room temperature; the binding solution is removed and the plate is washed three times with 200 \u03bcl volumes of PBS/0.2% BSA. Binding of the BMP to sclerostin is detected using polyclonal antiserum or monoclonal antibody specific for the BMP and an appropriate enzyme-conjugated second step reagent according to standard ELISA techniques (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Mol Biol. Vol 2 11.2.1-11.2.22 (1998)). Specific binding is calculated by subtracting non-specific binding from total binding and analyzed using the LIGAND program (Munson and Podbard, Anal. Biochem. 107:220-39 (1980))., 270491=The full length mouse Beer cDNA (Sequence ID No. 11) was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) in the antisense and sense direction using the manufacturer's protocol. 35S-alpha-GTP-labeled cRNA sense and antisense transcripts were synthesized using in-vitro transcription reagents supplied by Ambion, Inc (Austin, Tex.). In-situ hybridization was performed according to the protocols of Lyons et al. (J. Cell Biol. 111:2427-2436, 1990)., 205870=According to certain embodiments, non-human, human, or humanized heavy chain and light chain variable regions of any of the Ig molecules described herein may be constructed as single chain Fv (scFv) polypeptide fragments (single chain antibodies). See, e.g., Bird et al., 1988 Science 242:423-426; Huston et al., 1988 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883. Multi-functional scFv fusion proteins may be generated by linking a polynucleotide sequence encoding an scFv polypeptide in-frame with at least one polynucleotide sequence encoding any of a variety of known effector proteins. These methods are known in the art, and are disclosed, for example, in EP-B1-0318554, U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,405, U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,513, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,476,786. By way of example, effector proteins may include immunoglobulin constant region sequences. See, e.g., Hollenbaugh et al., 1995 J. Immunol. Methods 188:1-7. Other examples of effector proteins are enzymes. As a non-limiting example, such an enzyme may provide a biological activity for therapeutic purposes (see, e.g., Siemers et al., 1997 Bioconjug. Chem. 8:510-19), or may provide a detectable activity, such as horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed conversion of any of a number of well-known substrates into a detectable product, for diagnostic uses. Still other examples of scFv fusion proteins include Ig-toxin fusions, or immunotoxins, wherein the scFv polypeptide is linked to a toxin., 127955=In certain embodiments, the antibody according to the invention may have one or more effector or reporter molecules attached to it and the invention extends to such modified proteins. A reporter molecule may be a detectable moiety or label such as an enzyme, cytotoxic agent or other reporter molecule, including a dye, radionuclide, luminescent group, fluorescent group, or biotin, or the like. The TGF-beta binding protein-specific immunoglobulin or fragment thereof may be radiolabeled for diagnostic or therapeutic applications. Techniques for radiolabeling of antibodies are known in the art. See, e.g., Adams 1998 In Vivo 12:11-21; Hiltunen 1993 Acta Oncol. 32:831-9. Therapeutic applications are described in greater detail below and may include use of the TGF-beta binding protein specific antibody (or fragment thereof) in conjunction with other therapeutic agents. The effector or reporter molecules may be attached to the antibody through any available amino acid side-chain, terminal amino acid or, where present carbohydrate functional group located in the antibody, provided that the attachment or the attachment process does not adversely affect the binding properties and the usefulness of the molecule. Particular functional groups include, for example any free amino, imino, thiol, hydroxyl, carboxyl or aldehyde group. Attachment of the antibody and the effector and/or reporter molecule(s) may be achieved via such groups and an appropriate functional group in the effector or reporter molecules. The linkage may be direct or indirect through spacing or bridging groups., 204100=Introducing amino acid mutations into an immunoglobulin molecule specific for a TGF-beta binding protein may be useful to increase the specificity or affinity for TGF-beta binding protein or to alter an effector function. Immunoglobulins with higher affinity for TGF-beta binding protein may be generated by site-directed mutagenesis of particular residues. Computer assisted three-dimensional molecular modeling may be employed to identify the amino acid residues to be changed, in order to improve affinity for the TGF-beta binding protein. See, e.g., Mountain et al., 1992, Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 10:1-142. Alternatively, combinatorial libraries of CDRs may be generated in M13 phage and screened for immunoglobulin fragments with improved affinity. See, e.g., Glaser et al., 1992, J. Immunol. 149:3903-3913; Barbas et al., 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3809-13; U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,456., 45548=The present invention also provides antibodies that specifically bind to a TGF-beta binding protein, sclerostin (SOST), and provides immunogens comprising sclerostin peptides derived from regions of sclerostin that interact with a member of the TGF-beta superfamily such as a bone morphogenic protein. In one embodiment, the invention provides an antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, that binds specifically to a sclerostin polypeptide, said sclerostin polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, 6, 8, 14, 46, or 65, wherein the antibody competitively inhibits binding of the SOST polypeptide to at least one of (i) a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) Type I Receptor binding site and (ii) a BMP Type II Receptor binding site, wherein the BMP Type I Receptor binding site is capable of binding to a BMP Type I Receptor polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence set forth in GenBank Acc. Nos. NM\u2014004329 (SEQ ID NO:102); D89675 (SEQ ID NO:103); NM\u2014001203 (SEQ ID NO:104); 575359 (SEQ ID NO:105); NM\u2014030849 (SEQ ID NO:106); D38082 (SEQ ID NO:107); NP\u2014001194 (SEQ ID NO:108); BAA19765 (SEQ ID NO:109); or AAB33865 (SEQ ID NO:110) and wherein the BMP Type II Receptor binding site is capable of binding to a BMP Type II Receptor polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in GenBank Acc. NOs. U25110 (SEQ ID NO:111); NM\u2014033346 (SEQ ID NO:112); Z48923 (SEQ ID NO:114); CAA88759 (SEQ ID NO:115); or NM\u2014001204 (SEQ ID NO:113). In another embodiment, the invention provides an antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, that binds specifically to a sclerostin polypeptide and that impairs formation of a sclerostin homodimer, wherein the sclerostin polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 2, 6, 8, 14, 46, or 65., 266035=A set of 371 microsatellite markers (Research Genetics, Set 6) from the autosomal chromosomes was selected to type pools of DNA from sclerosteosis patient samples. The DNA samples for this analysis came from 29 sclerosteosis patients in 24 families, 59 unaffected family members and a set of unrelated control individuals from the same population. The pools consisted of 4-6 individuals, either affected individuals, affected individuals from consanguineous families, parents and unaffected siblings, or unrelated controls. In the pools of unrelated individuals and in most of the pools with affected individuals or family members analysis of the markers showed several allele sizes for each marker. One marker, D17S1299, showed an indication of homozygosity: one band in several of the pools of affected individuals., 142642=Similar to the above described methods, a wide variety of methods may be utilized to assess stimulation of TGF-beta due to a selected test compound. One such representative method is provided below in Example 6 (see also Durham et al., Endo. 136:1374-1380., 74742=A major advance in the understanding of bone formation was the identification of the bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), also known as osteogenic proteins (OPs), which regulate cartilage and bone differentiation in vivo. BMPs/OPs induce endochondral bone differentiation through a cascade of events that include formation of cartilage, hypertrophy and calcification of the cartilage, vascular invasion, differentiation of osteoblasts, and formation of bone. As described above, the BMPs/OPs (BMP 2-14, and osteogenic protein 1 and -2, OP-1 and OP-2) see, e.g., GenBank P12643 (BMP-2); GenBank P12645 (BMP3); GenBank P55107 (BMP-3b, Growth/differentiation factor 10) (GDF-10)); GenBank P12644 (BMP4); GenBank P22003 (BMP5); GenBank P22004 (BMP6); GenBank P18075 (BMP7); GenBank P34820 (BMP8); GenBank Q9UK05 (BMP9); GenBank O95393 (BM10); GenBank O95390 (BMP11, Growth/differentiation factor 11 precursor (GDF-11)); GenBank O95972 (BM15)) are members of the TGF-beta super-family. The striking evolutionary conservation between members the BMP/OP sub-family suggests that they are critical in the normal development and function of animals. Moreover, the presence of multiple forms of BMPs/OPs raises an important question about the biological relevance of this apparent redundancy. In addition to postfetal chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, the BMPs/OPs play multiple roles in skeletogenesis (including the development of craniofacial and dental tissues) and in embryonic development and organogenesis of parenchymatous organs, including the kidney. It is now understood that nature relies on common (and few) molecular mechanisms tailored to provide the emergence of specialized tissues and organs. The BMP/OP super-family is an elegant example of nature parsimony in programming multiple specialized functions deploying molecular isoforms with minor variation in amino acid motifs within highly conserved carboxy-terminal regions., 293507=FLAG-Beer protein (20 ng) is added to 100 ul PBS/0.2% BSA and adsorbed into each well of 96 well microtiter plate previously coated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma; St Louis Mo.) and blocked with 10% BSA in PBS. This is conducted at room temperature for 60 minutes. This protein solution is removed and the wells are washed to remove unbound protein. BMP-5 is added to each well in concentrations ranging from 10 \u03bcM to 500 nM in PBS/0.2% BSA and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The binding solution is removed and the plate washed with three times with 200 ul volumes of PBS/0.2% BSA. BMP-5 levels are then detected using BMP-5 antiserum via ELISA (F. M. Ausubel et al (1998) Current Protocols in Mol. Biol. Vol 2 11.2.1-11.2.22). Specific binding is calculated by subtracting non-specific binding from total binding and analyzed by the LIGAND program (Munson and Podbard, Anal. Biochem., 107, p 220-239, (1980)., 63144=\u201cSclerosteosis\u201d is a term that was applied by Hansen (1967) (Hansen, H. G., Sklerosteose. in: Opitz, H.; Schmid, F., Handbuch der Kinderheilkunde. Berlin: Springer (pub.) 6 1967. Pp. 351-355) to a disorder similar to van Buchem hyperostosis corticalis generalisata but possibly differing in radiologic appearance of the bone changes and in the presence of asymmetric cutaneous syndactyly of the index and middle fingers in many cases. The jaw has an unusually square appearance in this condition., 134062=When a thiol group in the antibody is used as the point of attachment this may be achieved through reaction with a thiol reactive group present in the effector or reporter molecule. Examples of such groups include an \ufffd-halocarboxylic acid or ester, such as iodoacetamide, an imide, such as maleimide, a vinyl sulphone, or a disulphide. These and other suitable linking procedures are generally and more particularly described in International Patent Specifications Nos. WO 93/06231, WO 92/22583, WO 90/091195, and WO 89/01476., 254287=Alternatively, in other embodiments, the invention provides for pharmaceutically-acceptable nanocapsule formulations of the compositions of the present invention. Nanocapsules can generally entrap compounds in a stable and reproducible way (see, for example, Quintanar-Guerrero et al., Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 24(12):1113-28, 1998). To avoid side effects due to intracellular polymeric overloading, such ultrafine particles (sized around 0.1 \u03bcm) may be designed using polymers able to be degraded in vivo. Such particles can be made as described, for example, by Couvreur et al., Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. 5(1):1-20, 1988; zur Muhlen et al., Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 45(2):149-55, 1998; Zambaux et al., J. Controlled Release 50(1-3):31-40, 1998; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,684., 123480=Monoclonal antibodies can be isolated and purified from hybridoma cultures by a variety of well-established techniques. Such isolation techniques include affinity chromatography with Protein-A Sepharose, size-exclusion chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography (see, for example, Coligan at pages 2.7.1-2.7.12 and pages 2.9.1-2.9.3; Baines et al., \u201cPurification of Immunoglobulin G (IgG),\u201d in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 10, pages 79-104 (The Humana Press, Inc. 1992))., 96165=As an alternative, a TGF-beta binding-protein gene can be obtained by synthesizing DNA molecules using mutually priming long oligonucleotides and the nucleotide sequences described herein (see, for example, Ausubel (1995) at pages 8-8 to 8-9). Established techniques using the polymerase chain reaction provide the ability to synthesize DNA molecules at least two kilobases in length (Adang et al., Plant Molec. Biol. 21:1131, 1993; Bambot et al., PCR Methods and Applications 2:266, 1993; Dillon et al., \u201cUse of the Polymerase Chain Reaction for the Rapid Construction of Synthetic Genes,\u201d in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 15: PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications, White (ed.), pages 263-268, (Humana Press, Inc. 1993); Holowachuk et al., PCR Methods Appl. 4:299, 1995)., 120962=Antibodies for use in the invention may in general be monoclonal (prepared to by conventional immunisation and cell fusion procedures) or in the case of fragments, derived therefrom using any suitable standard chemical such as reduction or enzymatic cleavage and/or digestion techniques, for example by treatment with pepsin. More specifically, monoclonal anti-TGF-beta binding-protein antibodies can be generated utilizing a variety of techniques. Rodent monoclonal antibodies to specific antigens may be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Kohler et al., Nature 256:495, 1975; and Coligan et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Immunology, 1:2.5.1-2.6.7 (John Wiley & Sons 1991) [\u201cColigan\u201d]; Picksley et al., \u201cProduction of monoclonal antibodies against proteins expressed in E. coli,\u201d in DNA Cloning 2: Expression Systems, 2nd Edition, Glover et al. (eds.), page 93 (Oxford University Press 1995))., 221392=Yeast and fungi host cells suitable for carrying out the present invention include, among others, Saccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the genera Pichia or Kluyveromyces and various species of the genus Aspergillus (McKnight et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,349). Suitable expression vectors for yeast and fungi include, among others, YCp50 (ATCC No. 37419) for yeast, and the amdS cloning vector pV3 (Turnbull, Bio/Technology 7:169, 1989), YRp7 (Struhl et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76:1035-1039, 1978), YEp13 (Broach et al., Gene 8:121-133, 1979), pJDB249 and pJDB219 (Beggs, Nature 275:104-108, 1978) and derivatives thereof., 101001=Standard techniques for functional analysis of proteins are described by, for example, Treuter et al., Molec. Gen. Genet. 240:113, 1993; Content et al., \u201cExpression and preliminary deletion analysis of the 42 kDa 2-5A synthetase induced by human interferon,\u201d in Biological Interferon Systems, Proceedings of ISIR-TNO Meeting on Interferon Systems, Cantell (ed.), pages 65-72 (Nijhoff 1987); Herschman, \u201cThe EGF Receptor,\u201d in Control of Animal Cell Proliferation, Vol. 1, Boynton et al., (eds.) pages 169-199 (Academic Press 1985); Coumailleau et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:29270, 1995; Fukunaga et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:25291, 1995; Yamaguchi et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 50:1295, 1995; Meisel et al., Plant Molec. Biol. 30:1, 1996., 235692=Within other aspects of the invention, nucleic acid molecules are provided which are capable of inhibiting TGF-beta binding-protein binding to a member of the TGF-beta family. For example, within one embodiment antisense oligonucleotide molecules are provided which specifically inhibit expression of TGF-beta binding-protein nucleic acid sequences (see generally, Hirashima et al. in Molecular Biology of RNA: New Perspectives (M. Inouye and B. S. Dudock, eds., 1987 Academic Press, San Diego, p. 401); Oligonucleotides: Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression (J. S. Cohen, ed., 1989 MacMillan Press, London); Stein and Cheng, Science 261:1004-1012, 1993; WO 95/10607; U.S. Pat. No. 5,359,051; WO 92/06693; and EP-A2-612844). Briefly, such molecules are constructed such that they are complementary to, and able to form Watson-Crick base pairs with, a region of transcribed TGF-beta binding-protein mRNA sequence. The resultant double-stranded nucleic acid interferes with subsequent processing of the mRNA, thereby preventing protein synthesis (see Example 10)., 174157=The lymphoid (e.g., spleen) cells and the myeloma cells may be combined for a few minutes with a membrane fusion-promoting agent, such as polyethylene glycol or a nonionic detergent, and then plated at low density on a selective medium that supports the growth of hybridoma cells but not unfused myeloma cells. Following the fusion, the cells may be placed into culture plates containing a suitable medium, such as RPMI 1640, or DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium) (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, Kans.), as well as additional ingredients, such as fetal bovine serum (FBS, i.e., from Hyclone, Logan, Utah, or JRH Biosciences). Additionally, the medium should contain a reagent which selectively allows for the growth of fused spleen and myeloma cells such as HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). After about seven days, the resulting fused cells or hybridomas may be screened in order to determine the presence of antibodies which are reactive with TGF-beta binding-protein (depending on the antigen used), and which block, impair, or inhibit the binding of TGF-beta binding-protein to a TGF-beta family member. Hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to sclerostin or a variant thereof are preferred., 67267=Sclerosteosis is a disease related to abnormal bone mineral density in humans. Sclerosteosis is a term that was applied by Hansen (1967) (Hansen, H. G., Sklerosteose. In: Opitz, H.; Schmid, F., Handbuch der Kinderheilkunde. Berlin: Springer (pub.) 6 1967. Pp. 351-355) to a disorder similar to van Buchem hyperostosis corticalis generalisata but possibly differing in radiologic appearance of the bone changes and differing in the presence of asymmetric cutaneous syndactyly of the index and middle fingers in many cases., 179848=Another method for generating human TGF-beta binding protein specific monoclonal antibodies includes immortalizing human peripheral blood cells by EBV transformation. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,464,456. Such an immortalized B cell line (or lymphoblastoid cell line) producing a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a TGF-beta binding protein (or a variant or fragment thereof) can be identified by immunodetection methods as provided herein, for example, an ELISA, and then isolated by standard cloning techniques. The stability of the lymphoblastoid cell line producing an anti-TGF-beta binding protein antibody may be improved by fusing the transformed cell line with a murine myeloma to produce a mouse-human hybrid cell line according to methods known in the art (see, e.g., Glasky et al., Hybridoma 8:377-89 (1989)). Still another method to generate human monoclonal antibodies is in vitro immunization, which includes priming human splenic B cells with antigen, followed by fusion of primed B cells with a heterohybrid fusion partner. See, e.g., Boerner et al., 1991. J. Immunol. 147:86-95., 48404=In another embodiment, the invention provides an immunogen comprising a peptide comprising at least 21 consecutive amino acids and no more than 50 consecutive amino acids of a SOST polypeptide, said SOST polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 2, 6, 8, 14, 46, or 65, wherein the peptide is capable of eliciting in a non-human animal an antibody that binds specifically to the SOST polypeptide and that competitively inhibits binding of the SOST polypeptide to at least one of (i) a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) Type I Receptor binding site and (ii) a BMP Type II Receptor binding site, wherein the BMP Type I Receptor binding site is capable of binding to a BMP Type I Receptor polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence set forth in GenBank Acc. Nos. NM\u2014004329 (SEQ ID NO:102); D89675 (SEQ ID NO:103); NM\u2014001203 (SEQ ID NO:104); 575359 (SEQ ID NO:105); NM\u2014030849 (SEQ ID NO:106); D38082 (SEQ ID NO:107); NP\u2014001194 (SEQ ID NO:108); BAA19765 (SEQ ID NO:109); or AAB33865 (SEQ ID NO:110) and wherein the BMP Type II Receptor binding site is capable of binding to a BMP Type II Receptor polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in GenBank Acc. NOs. U25110 (SEQ ID NO:111); NM\u2014033346 (SEQ ID NO:112); Z48923 (SEQ ID NO:114); CAA88759 (SEQ ID NO:115); or NM\u2014001204 (SEQ ID NO:113). The invention also provides an immunogen comprising a peptide that comprises at least 21 consecutive amino acids and no more than 50 consecutive amino acids of a SOST polypeptide, said SOST polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, 6, 8, 14, 46, or 65, wherein the peptide is capable of eliciting in a non-human animal an antibody that binds specifically to the SOST polypeptide and that impairs formation of a SOST homodimer., 126242=One or more replicable expression vectors containing the DNA encoding a variable and/or constant region may be prepared and used to transform an appropriate cell line, e.g. a non-producing myeloma cell line, such as a mouse NSO line or a bacterial, such as E. coli, in which production of the antibody will occur. In order to obtain efficient transcription and translation, the DNA sequence in each vector should include appropriate regulatory sequences, particularly a promoter and leader sequence operably linked to a variable domain sequence. Particular methods for producing antibodies in this way are generally well known and routinely used. For example, basic molecular biology procedures are described by Maniatis et al (Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1989); DNA sequencing can be performed as described in Sanger et al (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74: 5463, (1977)) and the Amersham International plc sequencing handbook; site directed mutagenesis can be carried out according to the method of Kramer et al. (Nucleic Acids Res. 12, 9441, (1984)); the Anglian Biotechnology Ltd handbook; Kunkel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488-92 (1985); Kunkel et al., Methods in Enzymol. 154:367-82 (1987). Additionally, numerous publications detail techniques suitable for the preparation of antibodies by manipulation of DNA, creation of expression vectors, and transformation of appropriate cells, for example as reviewed by Mountain A and Adair, J R in Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews (ed. Tombs, M P, 10, Chapter 1, 1992, Intercept, Andover, UK) and in International Patent Specification No. WO 91/09967., 146873=Representative examples of such combinatorial chemical libraries include those described by Agrafiotis et al., \u201cSystem and method of automatically generating chemical compounds with desired properties,\u201d U.S. Pat.

Each of the three antigens was separated by PAGE and transferred to 0.45 um nitrocellulose (Novex, San Diego, Calif.). The membrane was cut into strips with each strip containing approximately 75 ng of antigen. The strips were blocked in 3% Blotting Grade Block (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) and washed 3 times in 1\ufffdTris buffer saline (TBS)/0.02% TWEEN buffer. The primary antibody (preimmunization bleeds, rabbit antisera or chicken egg IgY in dilutions ranging from 1:100 to 1:10,000 in blocking buffer) was incubated with the strips for one hour with gentle rocking. A second series of three washes 1\ufffdTBS/0.02% TWEEN was followed by an one hour incubation with the secondary antibody (peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, Amersham Life Science, Piscataway, N.J.; or peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-chicken, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.). A final cycle of 3\ufffd washes of 1\ufffdTBS/0.02% TWEEN was performed and the strips were developed with Lumi-Light Western Blotting Substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany)., 108432=Preferred prokaryotic hosts include E. coli and Bacillus subtilus. Suitable strains of E. coli include BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)pLysS, BL21(DE3)pLysE, DH1, DH4I, DH5, DH5I, DH5IF\u2032, DH5IMCR, DH10B, DH10B/p3, DH11S, C600, HB101, JM101, JM105, JM109, JM110, K38, RR1, Y1088, Y1089, CSH18, ER1451, and ER1647 (see, for example, Brown (Ed.), Molecular Biology Labfax (Academic Press 1991)). Suitable strains of Bacillus subtilus include BR151, YB886, MI119, MI120, and B170 (see, for example, Hardy, \u201cBacillus Cloning Methods,\u201d in DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach, Glover (Ed.) (IRL Press 1985))., 171575=Antibodies for use in the invention include monoclonal antibodies that are prepared by conventional immunization and cell fusion procedures as described herein an known in the art. Monoclonal antibodies may be readily generated using conventional techniques (see, e.g., Kohler et al., Nature 256:495, 1975; Coligan et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Immunology, 1:2.5.1-2.6.7 (John Wiley & Sons 1991) [\u201cColigan\u201d]; U.S. Pat. Nos. RE 32,011, 4,902,614, 4,543,439, and 4,411,993 which are incorporated herein by reference; see also Monoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses, Plenum Press, Kennett, McKearn, and Bechtol (eds.), 1980, and Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988, which are also incorporated herein by reference; Picksley et al., \u201cProduction of monoclonal antibodies against proteins expressed in E. coli,\u201d in DNA Cloning 2: Expression Systems, 2nd Edition, Glover et al. (eds.), page 93 (Oxford University Press 1995)). Antibody fragments may be derived therefrom using any suitable standard technique such as proteolytic digestion, or optionally, by proteolytic digestion (for example, using papain or pepsin) followed by mild reduction of disulfide bonds and alkylation. Alternatively, such fragments may also be generated by recombinant genetic engineering techniques., 50586=The invention also provides a method for producing an antibody that specifically binds to a SOST polypeptide, comprising immunizing a non-human animal with an immunogen comprising a peptide comprising at least 21 consecutive amino acids and no more than 50 consecutive amino acids of a SOST polypeptide, wherein (a) the SOST polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, 6, 8, 14, 46, or 65; (b) the antibody competitively inhibits binding of the SOST polypeptide to at least one of (i) a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) Type I Receptor binding site and (ii) a BMP Type II Receptor binding site; (c) the BMP Type I Receptor binding site is capable of binding to a BMP Type I Receptor polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in GenBank Ace.

Expression of this gene renders mammalian cells sensitive (and inviable) to gancyclovir; it is therefore a convenient way to select against neomycin-resistant cells in which the construct has integrated by a non-homologous event (U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,764). The RSVLTR-HSVTK cassette was amplified from pPS1337 using primers that allow subsequent cloning into the FseI and AscI sites of the \u201clong arm\u201d-TA vector plasmid. For this PCR, the sequence of the sense primer was 5\u2032-ATTACGGCCGGCCGCAAAGGAATTCAAGA TCTGA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:40); the sequence of the anti-sense primer was 5\u2032-ATTACGGCGCGCCCCTC ACAGGCCGCACCCAGCT-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:41)., 107438=TGF-beta binding-protein genes may also be expressed in bacterial, yeast, insect, or plant cells. Suitable promoters that can be used to express TGF-beta binding-protein polypeptides in a prokaryotic host are well-known to those of skill in the art and include promoters capable of recognizing the T4, T3, Sp6 and T7 polymerases, the PR and PL promoters of bacteriophage lambda, the trp, recA, heat shock, lacUV5, tac, lpp-lacSpr, phoA, and lacZ promoters of E. coli, promoters of B. subtilis, the promoters of the bacteriophages of Bacillus, Streptomyces promoters, the int promoter of bacteriophage lambda, the bla promoter of pBR322, and the CAT promoter of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene. Prokaryotic promoters have been reviewed by Glick, J. Ind. Microbiol. 1:277, 1987, Watson et al., Molecular Biology of the Gene, 4th Ed. (Benjamin Cummins 1987), and by Ausubel et al. (1995)., 215144=Alternatively, oligonucleotide-directed site-specific (or segment specific) mutagenesis procedures may be employed to provide an altered gene or nucleic acid molecule having particular codons altered according to the substitution, deletion, or insertion required. Exemplary methods of making the alterations set forth above are disclosed by Walder et al. (Gene 42:133, 1986); Bauer et al. (Gene 37:73, 1985); Craik (BioTechniques, January 1985, 12-19); Smith et al. (Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods, Plenum Press, 1981); and Sambrook et al. (supra). Deletion or truncation derivatives of proteins (e.g., a soluble extracellular portion) may also be constructed by utilizing convenient restriction endonuclease sites adjacent to the desired deletion. Subsequent to restriction, overhangs may be filled in and the DNA religated. Exemplary methods of making the alterations set forth above are disclosed by Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989)., 278934=After five days the baculovirus-infected SF9 cells were harvested by centrifugation and cell associated protein was extracted from the cell pellet using a high salt extraction buffer (1.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5). The extract (20 ml per 300 ml culture) was clarified by centrifugation, dialyzed three times against four liters of Tris buffered saline (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5), and clarified by centrifugation again. This high salt fraction was applied to Hitrap Heparin (Pharmacia; 5 ml bed volume), washed extensively with HEPES buffered saline (25 mM HEPES 7.5, 150 mM Nacl) and bound proteins were eluted with a gradient from 150 mM NaCl to 1200 mM NaCl. Beer elution was observed at approximately 800 mM NaCl. Beer containing fractions were supplemented to 10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT and frozen at \u221280 degrees C., 207368=The scFv or any antibody fragment described herein may, in certain embodiments, be fused to peptide or polypeptide domains that permits detection of specific binding between the fusion protein and antigen (e.g., a TGF-beta binding protein). For example, the fusion polypeptide domain may be an affinity tag polypeptide for detecting binding of the scFv fusion protein to a TGF-beta binding protein by any of a variety of techniques with which those skilled in the art will be familiar. Examples of a peptide tag, include avidin, streptavidin or His (e.g., polyhistidine). Detection techniques may also include, for example, binding of an avidin or streptavidin fusion protein to biotin or to a biotin mimetic sequence (see, e.g., Luo et al., 1998 J. Biotechnol. 65:225 and references cited therein), direct covalent modification of a fusion protein with a detectable moiety (e.g., a labeling moiety), non-covalent binding of the fusion protein to a specific labeled reporter molecule, enzymatic modification of a detectable substrate by a fusion protein that includes a portion having enzyme activity, or immobilization (covalent or non-covalent) of the fusion protein on a solid-phase support. Other useful affinity polypeptides for construction of scFv fusion proteins may include streptavidin fusion proteins, as disclosed, for example, in WO 89/03422, U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,528, U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,691, WO 93/24631, U.S. Pat. No. 5,168,049, U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,254; avidin fusion proteins (see, e.g., EP 511,747); an enzyme such as glutathione-S-transferase; and Staphylococcus aureus protein A polypeptide., 266885=All 24 sclerosteosis families were typed with a total of 19 markers in the region of D17S1299 (at 17q12-q21). Affected individuals from every family were shown to be homozygous in this region, and 25 of the 29 individuals were homozygous for a core haplotype; they each had the same alleles between D17S1787 and D17S930. The other four individuals had one chromosome which matched this haplotype and a second which did not. In sum, the data compellingly suggested that this 3 megabase region contained the sclerosteosis mutation. Sequence analysis of most of the exons in this 3 megabase region identified a nonsense mutation in the novel TGF-beta binding-protein coding sequence (C>T mutation at position 117 of Sequence ID No. 1 results in a stop codon). This mutation was shown to be unique to sclerosteosis patients and carriers of Afrikaaner descent. The identity of the gene was further confirmed by identifying a mutation in its intron (A>T mutation at position +3 of the intron) which results in improper mRNA processing in a single, unrelated patient with diagnosed sclerosteosis., 222938=As with bacterial vectors, the yeast vectors will generally include a selectable marker, which may be one of any number of genes that exhibit a dominant phenotype for which a phenotypic assay exists to enable transformants to be selected. Preferred selectable markers are those that complement host cell auxotrophy, provide antibiotic resistance, or enable a cell to utilize specific carbon sources, and include leu2 (Broach et al., ibid.), ura3 (Botstein et al., Gene 8:17, 1979), or his3 (Struhl et al., ibid.). Another suitable selectable marker is the cat gene, which confers chloramphenicol resistance on yeast cells., 182498=For particular uses, fragments of anti-TGF-beta binding protein antibodies may be desired. Antibody fragments, F(ab\u2032)2 Fab, Fab\u2032, Fv, Fc, Fd, retain the antigen binding site of the whole antibody and therefore bind to the same epitope. These antigen-binding fragments derived from an antibody can be obtained, for example, by proteolytic hydrolysis of the antibody, for example, pepsin or papain digestion of whole antibodies according to conventional methods. As an illustration, antibody fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage of antibodies with pepsin to provide a 5S fragment denoted F(ab\u2032)2. This fragment can be further cleaved using a thiol reducing agent to produce 3.5S Fab\u2032 monovalent fragments. Optionally, the cleavage reaction can be performed using a blocking group for the sulfhydryl groups that result from cleavage of disulfide linkages. As an alternative, an enzymatic cleavage using papain produces two monovalent Fab fragments and an Fc fragment directly. These methods are described, for example, by Goldenberg, U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,647, Nisonoff et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 89:230, 1960; Porter, Biochem. J. 73:119, 1959; Edelman et al., in Methods in Enzymology 1:422 (Academic Press 1967); and by Coligan at pages 2.8.1-2.8.10 and 2.10.-2.10.4. Other methods for cleaving antibodies, such as separating heavy chains to form monovalent light-heavy chain fragments (Fd), further cleaving of fragments, or other enzymatic, chemical, or genetic techniques may also be used, so long as the fragments bind to the antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody., 214062=Other derivatives of the proteins disclosed herein include conjugates of the proteins along with other proteins or polypeptides. This may be accomplished, for example, by the synthesis of N-terminal or C-terminal fusion proteins which may be added to facilitate purification or identification of proteins (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,851,341, see also, Hopp et al., Bio/Technology 6:1204, 1988.) Alternatively, fusion proteins such as Flag\ufffd/TGF-beta binding-protein be constructed in order to assist in the identification, expression, and analysis of the protein., 218789=Nucleic acid molecules that encode any of the proteins described above may be readily expressed by a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells, including bacterial, mammalian, yeast or other fungi, viral, insect, or plant cells. Methods for transforming or transfecting such cells to express foreign DNA are well known in the art (see, e.g., Itakura et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,362; Hinnen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75:1929-1933, 1978; Murray et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,542; Upshall et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,349; Hagen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,784,950; Axel et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,216; Goeddel et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,075; and Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989; for plant cells see Czako and Marton, Plant Physiol. 104:1067-1071, 1994; and Paszkowski et al., Biotech. 24:387-392, 1992)., 176277=The monoclonal antibodies from the hybridoma cultures may be isolated from the supernatants of hybridoma cultures. An alternative method for production of a murine monoclonal antibody is to inject the hybridoma cells into the peritoneal cavity of a syngeneic mouse, for example, a mouse that has been treated (e.g., pristane-primed) to promote formation of ascites fluid containing the monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies can be isolated and purified by a variety of well-established techniques. Such isolation techniques include affinity chromatography with Protein-A Sepharose, size-exclusion chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography (see, for example, Coligan at pages 2.7.1-2.7.12 and pages 2.9.1-2.9.3; Baines et al., \u201cPurification of Immunoglobulin G (IgG),\u201d in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 10, pages 79-104 (The Humana Press, Inc. 1992)). Monoclonal antibodies may be purified by affinity chromatography using an appropriate ligand selected based on particular properties of the antibody (e.g., heavy or light chain isotype, binding specificity, etc.). Examples of a suitable ligand, immobilized on a solid support, include Protein A, Protein G, an anti-constant region (light chain or heavy chain) antibody, an anti-idiotype antibody, and a TGF-beta binding protein, or fragment or variant thereof., 209025=The polynucleotides encoding an antibody or fragment thereof that specifically bind a TGF-beta binding protein, as described herein, may be propagated and expressed according to any of a variety of well-known procedures for nucleic acid excision, ligation, transformation, and transfection using any number of known expression vectors. Thus, in certain embodiments expression of an antibody fragment may be preferred in a prokaryotic host, such as Escherichia coli (see, e.g., Pluckthun et al., 1989 Methods Enzymol. 178:497-515). In certain other embodiments, expression of the antibody or a fragment thereof may be preferred in a eukaryotic host cell, including yeast (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Pichia pastoris), animal cells (including mammalian cells) or plant cells. Examples of suitable animal cells include, but are not limited to, myeloma (such as a mouse NSO line), COS, CHO, or hybridoma cells. Examples of plant cells include tobacco, corn, soybean, and rice cells., 236810=Within other aspects of the invention, ribozymes are provided which are capable of inhibiting the TGF-beta binding-protein binding to a member of the TGF-beta family. As used herein, \u201cribozymes\u201d are intended to include RNA molecules that contain anti-sense sequences for specific recognition, and an RNA-cleaving enzymatic activity. The catalytic strand cleaves a specific site in a target RNA at greater than stoichiometric concentration. A wide variety of ribozymes may be utilized within the context of the present invention, including for example, the hammerhead ribozyme (for example, as described by Forster and Symons, Cell 48:211-220, 1987; Haseloff and Gerlach, Nature 328:596-600, 1988; Walbot and Bruening, Nature 334:196, 1988; Haseloff and Gerlach, Nature 334:585, 1988); the hairpin ribozyme (for example, as described by Haseloff et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,678, issued Oct. 19, 1993 and Hempel et al., European Patent Publication No. 0 360 257, published Mar. 26, 1990); and Tetrahymena ribosomal RNA-based ribozymes (see Cech et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,987,071). Ribozymes of the present invention typically consist of RNA, but may also be composed of DNA, nucleic acid analogs (e.g., phosphorothioates), or chimerics thereof (e.g., DNA/RNA/RNA)., 191255=A non-human/human chimeric antibody may be further genetically engineered to create a \u201chumanized\u201d antibody. Such a humanized antibody may comprise a plurality of CDRs derived from an immunoglobulin of a non-human mammalian species, at least one human variable framework region, and at least one human immunoglobulin constant region. Useful strategies for designing humanized antibodies may include, for example by way of illustration and not limitation, identification of human variable framework regions that are most homologous to the non-human framework regions of the chimeric antibody. Without wishing to be bound by theory, such a strategy may increase the likelihood that the humanized antibody will retain specific binding affinity for a TGF-beta binding protein, which in some preferred embodiments may be substantially the same affinity for a TGF-beta binding protein or variant or fragment thereof, and in certain other preferred embodiments may be a greater affinity for TGF-beta binding protein. See, e.g., Jones et al., 1986 Nature 321:522-25; Riechmann et al., 1988 Nature 332:323-27. Designing such a humanized antibody may therefore include determining CDR loop conformations and structural determinants of the non-human variable regions, for example, by computer modeling, and then comparing the CDR loops and determinants to known human CDR loop structures and determinants. See, e.g., Padlan et al., 1995 FASEB 9:133-39; Chothia et al., 1989 Nature, 342:377-383. Computer modeling may also be used to compare human structural templates selected by sequence homology with the non-human variable regions. See, e.g., Bajorath et al., 1995 Ther. Immunol. 2:95-103; EP-0578515-A3. If humanization of the non-human CDRs results in a decrease in binding affinity, computer modeling may aid in identifying specific amino acid residues that could be changed by site-directed or other mutagenesis techniques to partially, completely or supra-optimally (i.e., increase to a level greater than that of the non-humanized antibody) restore affinity. Those having ordinary skill in the art are familiar with these techniques, and will readily appreciate numerous variations and modifications to such design strategies., 76704=BMPs are synthesized as large precursor proteins. Upon dimerization, the BMPs are proteolytically cleaved within the cell to yield carboxy-terminal mature proteins that are then secreted from the cell. BMPs, like other TGF-beta family members, initiate signal transduction by binding cooperatively to both type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. Type I receptors for which BMPs may act as ligands include BMPR-IA (also known as ALK-3), BMPR-IB (also known as ALK-6), ALK-1, and ALK-2 (also known as ActR-I). Of the type II receptors, BMPs bind to BMP type II receptor (BMPR-II), Activin type II (ActR-II), and Activin type IIB (ActR-IIB). (See Balemans et al., supra, and references cited therein). Polynucleotide sequences and the encoded amino acid sequence of BMP type I receptor polypeptides are provided in the GenBank database, for example, GenBank NM\u2014004329 (SEQ ID NO:102 encoded by SEQ ID NO:116); D89675 (SEQ ID NO:103 encoded by SEQ ID NO:117); NM\u2014001203 (SEQ ID NO:104 encoded by SEQ ID NO:118); 575359 (SEQ ID NO:105 encoded by SEQ ID NO:119); NM\u2014030849 (SEQ ID NO:106 encoded by SEQ ID NO:120); and D38082 (SEQ ID NO:107 encoded by SEQ ID NO:121). Other polypeptide sequences of type I receptors are provided in the GenBank database, for example, NP\u2014001194 (SEQ ID NO:108); BAA19765 (SEQ ID NO:109); and AAB33865 (SEQ ID NO:110). Polynucleotide sequences and the encoded amino acid sequence of BMP type II receptor polypeptides are provided in the GenBank database and include, for example, U25110 (SEQ ID NO:111 encoded by SEQ ID NO:122); NM\u2014033346 (SEQ ID NO:112 encoded by SEQ ID NO:123); NM\u2014001204 (SEQ ID NO:113 encoded by SEQ ID NO:124); and Z48923 (SEQ ID NO:114 encoded by SEQ ID NO:125). Additional polypeptide sequences of type II receptors are also provided in the GenBank database, for example, CAA88759 (SEQ ID NO:115)., 224187=Protocols for the transformation of yeast are also well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, transformation may be readily accomplished either by preparation of spheroplasts of yeast with DNA (see Hinnen et al., PNAS USA 75:1929, 1978) or by treatment with alkaline salts such as LiCl (see Itoh et al., J. Bacteriology 153:163, 1983). Transformation of fungi may also be carried out using polyethylene glycol as described by Cullen et al. (Bio/Technology 5:369, 1987)., 264860=Linkage analysis of the gene defect associated with sclerosteosis was conducted by applying the homozygosity mapping method to DNA samples collected from 24 South African Afrikaaner families in which the disease occurred. (Sheffield et al., 1994, Human Molecular Genetics 3:1331-1335. \u201cIdentification of a Bardet-Biedl syndrome locus on chromosome 3 and evaluation of an efficient approach to homozygosity mapping\u201d). The Afrikaaner population of South Africa is genetically homogeneous; the population is descended from a small number of founders who colonized the area several centuries ago, and it has been isolated by geographic and social barriers since the founding. Sclerosteosis is rare everywhere in the world outside the Afrikaaner community, which suggests that a mutation in the gene was present in the founding population and has since increased in numbers along with the increase in the population. The use of homozygosity mapping is based on the assumption that DNA mapping markers adjacent to a recessive mutation are likely to be homozygous in affected individuals from consanguineous families and isolated populations., 122540=In addition, an anti-TGF-beta binding-protein antibody of the present invention may be derived from a human monoclonal antibody. Human monoclonal antibodies are obtained from transgenic mice that have been engineered to produce specific human antibodies in response to antigenic challenge. In this technique, elements of the human heavy and light chain locus are introduced into strains of mice derived from embryonic stem cell lines that contain targeted disruptions of the endogenous heavy chain and light chain loci. The transgenic mice can synthesize human antibodies specific for human antigens, and the mice can be used to produce human antibody-secreting hybridomas. Methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic mice are described, for example, by Green et al., Nature Genet. 7:13, 1994; Lonberg et al., Nature 368:856, 1994; and Taylor et al., Int. Immun. 6:579, 1994., 116132=Polyclonal antibodies to recombinant TGF-beta binding-protein can be prepared using methods well-known to those of skill in the art (see, for example, Green et al., \u201cProduction of Polyclonal Antisera,\u201d in Immunochemical Protocols (Manson, ed.), pages 1-5 (Humana Press 1992); Williams et al., \u201cExpression of foreign proteins in E. coli using plasmid vectors and purification of specific polyclonal antibodies,\u201d in DNA Cloning 2: Expression Systems, 2nd Edition, Glover et al. (eds.), page 15 (Oxford University Press 1995)). Although polyclonal antibodies are typically raised in animals such as rats, mice, rabbits, goats, or sheep, an anti-TGF-beta binding-protein antibody of the present invention may also be derived from a subhuman primate antibody. General techniques for raising diagnostically and therapeutically useful antibodies in baboons may be found, for example, in Goldenberg et al., international patent publication No. WO 91/11465 (1991), and in Losman et al., Int. J. Cancer 46:310, 1990., 222119=Preferred promoters for use in yeast include promoters from yeast glycolytic genes (Hitzeman et al., J. Biol. Chem. 255:12073-12080, 1980; Alber and Kawasaki, J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1:419-434, 1982) or alcohol dehydrogenase genes (Young et al., in Genetic Engineering of Microorganisms for Chemicals, Hollaender et al. (eds.), p. 355, Plenum, New York, 1982; Ammerer, Meth. Enzymol. 101:192-201, 1983). Examples of useful promoters for fungi vectors include those derived from Aspergillus nidulans glycolytic genes, such as the adh3 promoter (McKnight et al., EMBO J. 4:2093-2099, 1985). The expression units may also include a transcriptional terminator. An example of a suitable terminator is the adh3 terminator (McKnight et al., supra, 1985)., 129592=Effector molecules include, for example, antineoplastic agents, toxins (such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial (such as P. aeruginosa exotoxin A) or plant origin and fragments thereof (e.g. ricin and fragments thereof; plant gelonin, bryodin from Bryonia dioica, or the like. See, e.g., Thrush et al., 1996 Annu. Rev. Immunol. 14:49-71; Frankel et al., 1996 Cancer Res. 56:926-32); biologically active proteins, for example enzymes; nucleic acids and fragments thereof such as. DNA, RNA and fragments thereof; naturally occurring and synthetic polymers (e.g., polysaccharides and polyalkylene polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) and derivatives thereof); radionuclides, particularly radioiodide; and chelated metals. Suitable reporter groups include chelated metals, fluorescent compounds, or compounds that may be detected by NMR or ESR spectroscopy. Particularly useful effector groups are calichaemicin and derivatives thereof (see, for example, South African Patent Specifications Nos. 85/8794, 88/8127 and 90/2839)., 162101=Antibodies which inhibit the binding of TGF-beta binding-protein to a TGF-beta family member may readily be prepared given the disclosure provided herein. Particularly useful are anti-TGF-beta binding-protein antibodies that \u201cspecifically bind\u201d TGF-beta binding-protein of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 46, or 65, but not to other TGF-beta binding-proteins such as Dan, Cerberus, SCGF, or Gremlin. Within the context of the present invention, antibodies are understood to include monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, single chain, chimeric, CDR-grafted immunoglobulins, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibody fragments thereof (e.g., Fab, Fd, Fab\u2032, and F(ab\u2032)2, Fv, variable regions, or complementarity determining regions). As discussed above, antibodies are understood to be specific against TGF-beta binding-protein, or against a specific TGF-beta family member, if they bind with a Ka of greater than or equal to 107 M\u22121, preferably greater than or equal to 108 M\u22121, and do not bind to other TGF-beta binding-proteins, or bind with a Ka of less than or equal to 106 M\u22121. Affinity of an antibody for its cognate antigen is also commonly expressed as a dissociation constant KD, and an anti-SOST is antibody specifically binds to a TGF-beta family member if it binds with a KD of less than or equal to about 10\u22125 M, more preferably less than or equal to about 10\u22126 M, still more preferably less than or equal to 10\u22127 M, and still more preferably less than or equal to 10\u22128 M. Furthermore, antibodies of the present invention preferably block, impair, or inhibit (e.g., decrease with statistical significance) the binding of TGF-beta binding-protein to a TGF-beta family member. The affinity of a monoclonal antibody or binding partner, as well as inhibition of binding can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art (see Scatchard, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 51:660-672, 1949). Affinity may also be determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; BIAcore, Biosensor, Piscataway, N.J.). For surface plasmon resonance, target molecules are immobilized on a solid phase and exposed to ligands in a mobile phase running along a flow cell. If ligand binding to the immobilized target occurs, the local refractive index changes, leading to a change in SPR angle, which can be monitored in real time by detecting changes in the intensity of the reflected light. The rates of change of the SPR signal can be analyzed to yield apparent rate constants for the association and dissociation phases of the binding reaction. The ratio of these values gives the apparent equilibrium constant (affinity) (see, e.g., Wolff et al., Cancer Res. 53:2560-65 (1993))., 249230=In one embodiment, for parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, the solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection, a sterile aqueous medium that can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage may be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion, (see for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th ed., pp. 1035-1038 and 1570-1580). Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. Moreover, for human administration, preparations will of course preferably meet sterility, pyrogenicity, and the general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biologics standards., 124002=For particular uses, it may be desirable to prepare fragments of anti-TGF-beta binding-protein antibodies. Such antibody fragments can be obtained, for example, by proteolytic hydrolysis of the antibody. Antibody fragments can be obtained by pepsin or papain digestion of whole antibodies by conventional methods. As an illustration, antibody fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage of antibodies with pepsin to provide a 5S fragment denoted F(ab\u2032)2. This fragment can be further cleaved using a thiol reducing agent to produce 3.5S Fab\u2032 monovalent fragments. Optionally, the cleavage reaction can be performed using a blocking group for the sulfhydryl groups that result from cleavage of disulfide linkages. As an alternative, an enzymatic cleavage using pepsin produces two monovalent Fab fragments and an Fc fragment directly. These methods are described, for example, by Goldenberg, U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,647, Nisonoff et al., Arch Biochem. Biophys. 89:230, 1960, Porter, Biochem. J. 73:119, 1959, Edelman et al., in Methods in Enzymology 1:422 (Academic Press 1967), and by Coligan at pages 2.8.1-2.8.10 and 2.10.-2.10.4., 220222=Bacterial expression vectors preferably comprise a promoter which functions in the host cell, one or more selectable phenotypic markers, and a bacterial origin of replication. Representative promoters include the \u03b2-lactamase (penicillinase) and lactose promoter system (see Chang et al., Nature 275:615, 1978), the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (Studier et al., Meth. Enzymol. 185:60-89, 1990), the lambda promoter (Elvin et al., Gene 87:123-126, 1990), the tip promoter (Nichols and Yanofsky, Meth. in Enzymology 101:155, 1983), and the tac promoter (Russell et al., Gene 20:231, 1982). Representative selectable markers include various antibiotic resistance markers such as the kanamycin or ampicillin resistance genes. Many plasmids suitable for transforming host cells are well known in the art, including among others, pBR322 (see Bolivar et al., Gene 2:95, 1977), the pUC plasmids pUC18, pUC19, pUC118, pUC119 (see Messing, Meth. in Enzymology 101:20-77, 1983 and Vieira and Messing, Gene 19:259-268, 1982), and pNH8A, pNH16a, pNH18a, and Bluescript M13 (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.)., 245230=For pharmaceutical compositions comprising a polynucleotide encoding an anti-SOST antibody and/or modulating agent (such that the polypeptide and/or modulating agent is generated in situ), the polynucleotide may be present within any of a variety of delivery systems known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including nucleic acid, and bacterial, viral and mammalian expression systems. Techniques for incorporating DNA into such expression systems are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The DNA may also be \u201cnaked,\u201d as described, for example, in Ulmer et al., Science 259:1745-1749, 1993 and reviewed by Cohen, Science 259:1691-1692, 1993. The uptake of naked DNA may be increased by coating the DNA onto biodegradable beads, which are efficiently transported into the cells., 259580=A vector that directs the expression of a molecule that inhibits the binding of TGF-beta binding-protein to a member of the TGF-beta family may be introduced into cells. Representative examples of suitable vectors include viral vectors such as herpes viral vectors (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,641), adenoviral vectors (e.g., WO 94/26914, WO 93/9191; Kolls et al., PNAS 91(1):215-219, 1994; Kass-Eisler et al., PNAS 90(24):11498-502, 1993; Guzman et al., Circulation 88(6):2838-48, 1993; Guzman et al., Cir. Res. 73(6):1202-1207, 1993; Zabner et al., Cell 75(2):207-216, 1993; Li et al., Hum Gene Ther. 4(4):403-409, 1993; Caillaud et al., Eur. J. Neurosci. 5(10:1287-1291, 1993; Vincent et al., Nat. Genet. 5(2):130-134, 1993; Jaffe et al., Nat. Genet. 1(5):372-378, 1992; and Levrero et al., Gene 101(2):195-202, 1991), adeno-associated viral vectors (WO 95/13365; Flotte et al., PNAS 90(22):10613-10617, 1993), baculovirus vectors, parvovirus vectors (Koering et al., Hum. Gene Therap. 5:457-463, 1994), pox virus vectors (Panicali and Paoletti, PNAS 79:4927-4931, 1982; and Ozaki et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 193(2):653-660, 1993), and retroviruses (e.g., EP 0,415,731; WO 90/07936; WO 91/0285, WO 94/03622; WO 93/25698; WO 93/25234; U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,740; WO 93/11230; WO 93/10218). Viral vectors may likewise be constructed which contain a mixture of different elements (e.g., promoters, envelope sequences, and the like) from different viruses, or non-viral sources. Within various embodiments, either the viral vector itself, or a viral particle which contains the viral vector may be utilized in the methods and compositions described below. Within other embodiments of the invention, nucleic acid molecules which encode a molecule which inhibits binding of the TGF-beta binding-protein to a member of the TGF-beta family may be administered by a variety of techniques, including, for example, administration of asialoosomucoid (ASOR) conjugated with poly-L-lysine DNA complexes (Cristano et al., PNAS 92122-92126, 1993), DNA linked to killed adenovirus (Curiel et al., Hum. Gene Ther. 3(2):147-154, 1992), cytofectin-mediated introduction (DMRIE-DOPE, Vical, Calif.), direct DNA injection (Acsadi et al., Nature 352:815-818, 1991); DNA ligand (Wu et al., J. of Biol. Chem. 264:16985-16987, 1989); lipofection (Feigner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7413-7417, 1989); liposomes (Pickering et al., Circ. 89(1):13-21, 1994; and Wang et al., PNAS 84:7851-7855, 1987); microprojectile bombardment (Williams et al., PNAS 88:2726-2730, 1991); and direct delivery of nucleic acids which encode the protein itself either alone (Vile and Hart, Cancer Res. 53: 3860-3864, 1993), or utilizing PEG-nucleic acid complexes. Representative examples of molecules that may be expressed by the vectors of present invention include ribozymes and antisense molecules, each of which are discussed in more detail above., 189350=Chimeric antibodies, specific for a TGF-beta binding protein, and which include humanized antibodies, may also be generated according to the present invention. A chimeric antibody has at least one constant region domain derived from a first mammalian species and at least one variable region domain derived from a second, distinct mammalian species (see, e.g., Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-55 (1984)). In preferred embodiments, a chimeric antibody may be constructed by cloning the polynucleotide sequence that encodes at least one variable region domain derived from a non-human monoclonal antibody, such as the variable region derived from a murine, rat, or hamster monoclonal antibody, into a vector containing a nucleotide sequence that encodes at least one human constant region (see, e.g., Shin et al., Methods Enzymol. 178:459-76 (1989); Walls et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 21:2921-29 (1993)). By way of example, the polynucleotide sequence encoding the light chain variable region of a murine monoclonal antibody may be inserted into a vector containing a nucleotide sequence encoding the human kappa light chain constant region sequence. In a separate vector, the polynucleotide sequence encoding the heavy chain variable region of the monoclonal antibody may be cloned in frame with sequences encoding a human IgG constant region, for example, the human IgG1 constant region. The particular human constant region selected may depend upon the effector functions desired for the particular antibody (e.g., complement fixing, binding to a particular Fc receptor, etc.). Preferably, the constructed vectors will be transfected into eukaryotic cells for stable expression of the chimeric antibody. Another method known in the art for generating chimeric antibodies is homologous recombination (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,482,856)., 177643=In addition, an anti-TGF-beta binding-protein antibody of the present invention may be a human monoclonal antibody. Human monoclonal antibodies may be generated by any number of techniques with which those having ordinary skill in the art will be familiar. Such methods include, but are not limited to, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) transformation of human peripheral blood cells (e.g., containing B lymphocytes), in vitro immunization of human B cells, fusion of spleen cells from immunized transgenic mice carrying inserted human immunoglobulin genes, isolation from human immunoglobulin V region phage libraries, or other procedures as known in the art and based on the disclosure herein. For example, human monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from transgenic mice that have been engineered to produce specific human antibodies in response to antigenic challenge. Methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic mice are described, for example, by Green et al., Nature Genet. 7:13, 1994; Lonberg et al., Nature 368:856, 1994; Taylor et al., Int. Immun. 6:579, 1994; U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,397; Bruggemann et al., 1997 Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 8:455-58; Jakobovits et al., 1995 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 764:525-35. In this technique, elements of the human heavy and light chain locus are introduced into strains of mice derived from embryonic stem cell lines that contain targeted disruptions of the endogenous heavy chain and light chain loci. (See also Bruggemann et al., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 8:455-58 (1997)). For example, human immunoglobulin transgenes may be mini-gene constructs, or transloci on yeast artificial chromosomes, which undergo B cell-specific DNA rearrangement and hypermutation in the mouse lymphoid tissue. Human monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by immunizing the transgenic mice, which may then produce human antibodies specific for the antigen. Lymphoid cells of the immunized transgenic mice can be used to produce human antibody-secreting hybridomas according to the methods described herein. Polyclonal sera containing human antibodies may also be obtained from the blood of the immunized animals., 291270=Following the protocol described in the previous section, nitrocellulose strips of Beer, Gremlin or Dan were incubated with dilutions (1:5000 and 1:10,000) of their respective rabbit antisera or chicken egg IgY as well as to antisera or chicken egg Igy (dilutions 1:1000 and 1:5000) made to the remaining two antigens. The increased levels of nonmatching antibodies was performed to detect low affinity binding by those antibodies that may be seen only at increased concentration. The protocol and duration of development is the same for all three binding events using the protocol described above. There was no antigen cross-reactivity observed for any of the antigens tested., 130686=Numerous other toxins, including chemotherapeutic agents, anti-mitotic agents, antibiotics, inducers of apoptosis (or \u201capoptogens\u201d, see, e.g., Green and Reed, 1998, Science 281:1309-1312), or the like, are known to those familiar with the art, and the examples provided herein are intended to be illustrative without limiting the scope and spirit of the invention. Particular antineoplastic agents include cytotoxic and cytostatic agents, for example alkylating agents, such as nitrogen mustards (e.g., chlorambucil, melphalan, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, or uracil mustard) and derivatives thereof, triethylenephosphoramide, triethylenethiophosphor-amide, busulphan, or cisplatin; antimetabolites, such as methotrexate, fluorouracil, floxuridine, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, fluoroacetic acid or fluorocitric acid, antibiotics, such as bleomycins (e.g., bleomycin sulphate), doxorubicin, daunorubicin, mitomycins (e.g., mitomycin C), actinomycins (e.g., dactinomycin) plicamycin, calichaemicin and derivatives thereof, or esperamicin and derivatives thereof; mitotic inhibitors, such as etoposide, vincristine or vinblastine and derivatives thereof; alkaloids, such as ellipticine; polyols such as taxicin-I or taxicin-II; hormones, such as androgens (e.g., dromostanolone or testolactone), progestins (e.g., megestrol acetate or medroxyprogesterone acetate), estrogens (e.g., dimethylstilbestrol diphosphate, polyestradiol phosphate or estramustine phosphate) or antiestrogens (e.g., tamoxifen); anthraquinones, such as mitoxantrone, ureas, such as hydroxyurea; hydrazines, such as procarbazine; or imidazoles, such as dacarbazine.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations From the foregoing, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims. An antibody that inhibits or impairs binding of the sclerostin TGF-beta binding protein to the hydroxyapatite is identified by incubating the TGF-beta binding protein with the antibody and applying the mixture to the matrix as described above. The matrix is washed 3 times with 0.2% albumin in PBS buffer. Adsorbed sclerostin is eluted with 0.3 M NaOH and then quantified. An antibody that inhibits the level of binding of sclerostin to the hydroxyapatite by at least 40% compared to the level of binding observed in the absence of antibody is considered a bone localization inhibitor. Such an antibody is further characterized in dose response studies to determine its inhibition constant and its effect on TGF-beta binding-protein binding affinity. Evaluation of inhibition of localization to bone matrix (hydroxyapatite) is conducted using modifications to the method of Nicolas (Calcif. Tissue Int. 57:206-12 (1995)). Briefly, 125I-labelled TGF-beta binding-protein is prepared as described by Nicolas (supra). Hydroxyapatite is added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate equipped with a polypropylene filtration membrane (Polyfiltroninc, Weymouth Mass.). TGF-beta binding-protein diluted in 0.2% albumin in PBS buffer is then added to the wells. The wells",
