All rights reserved., 62546=29 January 2014, 84770=Towards the end of the half, Slovenia took control of proceedings, with Vrhovec threatening more than once. The pressure told when Kristjan \u010cujec turned in Rok Mordej's near-post corner.

However, Azerbaijan levelled at 5-5 and 6-6 before Edu's last-minute intervention left the section wide open ahead of his team's Sunday decider with Italy., 59182=28 January 2014, 76017=2 February 2014, 84452=Azerbaijan had to wait four days to be the last of the 12 teams to start, and within 24 seconds Amadeu found the net on his competitive international debut with a vicious effort. Vrhovec equalised for Slovenia less than a minute later, though, pouncing on a rebound from Igor Osredkar's blocked shot., 85418=Vrhovec completed his hat-trick following fine work from \u010cujec, but moments later Borisov restored hope for Azerbaijan, now playing with Edu as flying goalkeeper. With eight minutes left, Augusto struck from a seemingly impossible angle to further reduce arrears.}",
