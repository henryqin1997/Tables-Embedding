    "textBeforeTable": "Data Sheet Cisco 3660 Voice Gateway A natural extension of Cisco Systems IP networking expertise, the Cisco 3660 Voice Gateway relays high quality voice and fax traffic across an IP Network. When equipped with digital T1/E1 packet voice trunk network modules and voice-enabled Cisco IOS\u00ae software, the Cisco 3660 supports carrier-class Voice over\u00a0IP (VoIP) and fax over IP services. Cisco IOS software offers a powerful array of quality-of-service (QoS) mechanisms, variable frame sizing, and standards-based H.323 controls, which provide industry-leading voice quality and call control routing to deliver enhanced services. In addition to being H.323 and NEBS Level 3 compliant, the Cisco 3660 Voice Gateway supports a family of\u00a0industry-standard voice CODECs and provides echo cancellation and voice activity detection (VAD)/silence suppression. It offers an integrated interactive voice response (IVR) solution that provides voice-prompts and digit collection in order to authenticate the user and identify the call destination. Users can readily interface with Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) digital switches or private branch exchanges (PBXs), and\u00a0existing Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) authentication and billing\u00a0servers. The Cisco 3660 Voice Gateway's Digital T1/E1 Packet Voice Trunk Network Modules ensure predictable, real-time voice processing. The Cisco 3660 Voice Gateway can accept 6 Digital T1/E1 Packet Voice Trunk Network Modules, allowing it to scale up to 360 voice connections within a single chassis.
