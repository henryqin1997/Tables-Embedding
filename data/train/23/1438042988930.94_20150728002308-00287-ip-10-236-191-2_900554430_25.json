    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck As a community college, Rock Valley College definitely tops the list when it comes to a need for great learning at the right cost. Tuition is based on the credit hours for the course, and it is relatively cheap compared to other schools. You also gain access to the college's resources, including an extensive writing center to help achieve your paper based goals, and a tutoring center free to students where you can be tutored by students who have completed the class with a B or higher, or by instructors. Did enjoy being here Rock Valley College may not offer much in the way of activities, due to it's size, however, the campus itself is very nice, class sizes are generally below 30, and you meet a great deal of people from the community. I personally worked at the tutoring center on campus, and met a great deal of people through it, all of whom I have become great friends with. Did learn a lot Rock Valley College Provided an excellent learning and preparatory experience, by providing challenging courses with expectations of a four year school. I would definitely recommend this college for learning. Login to rate",
