            "METHOD OF FABRICATING HERMETIC TERMINAL AND HERMETIC TERMINAL, METHOD OF FABRICATING PIEZOELECTRIC OSCILLATOR AND PIEZOELECTRIC OSCILLATOR, OSCILLATOR, ELECTRONIC APPLIANCE, AND RADIO CLOCK - A method of fabricating a hermetic terminal having an annular ring, a lead arranged to penetrate through the ring in which one end side thereof is an inner lead portion electrically connected to a piezoelectric vibrating piece and the other end side thereof is an outer lead portion electrically connected to outside as the ring is between them, and a filler fixing the lead to the ring, wherein the hermetic terminal seals the piezoelectric vibrating piece inside a case, the method includes the steps of: applying plating to a hermetic terminal intermediate having the lead fixed in the ring with the filler to plate the ring and the lead; setting the hermetic terminal intermediate after subjected to plating on a holding member; and flattening an end part of an inner lead portion in the lead to form a stair portion in the hermetic terminal intermediate set on the holding member.",
            "LID BODY PORTION AND ELECTRONIC DEVICE PACKAGE USING THE LID BODY PORTION AND ELECTRONIC DEVICE - To provide a lid body portion with an improved mounting ratio of an electronic device component, an electronic device package and an electronic device including the same. There is provided a lid body portion including a concave portion in which a space portion is formed by a bottom portion and a side plate portion and a flange portion extending from an outer edge portion in an opening portion of the concave portion to the outside, in which a side-plate inner surface as a surface facing the space portion of the concave portion in the side plate portion inclines to the outside of the space portion."
