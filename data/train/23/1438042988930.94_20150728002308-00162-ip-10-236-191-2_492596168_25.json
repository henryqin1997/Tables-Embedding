One particular binder disclosed is based on a triammonium citrate-dextrose system derived from mixing dextrose monohydrate, anhydrous citric acid, water and aqueous ammonia. One of the many advantages of this binder system is that it is formaldehyde free., 22321=This application is a U.S. national counterpart application of International Application Serial No. PCT/EP2008/060185, filed Aug. 1, 2008, under 35 USC \ufffd371, which claims priority to European Patent Application Serial Number 0715100.4, filed on Aug. 3, 2007, European Patent Application Serial Number 0807777.8, filed Apr. 29, 2008, and European Patent Application Serial Number 0810297.2, filed Jun. 6, 2008 the entire disclosures of each are hereby incorporated herein by reference., 26197=It has been found that binders according to the present invention may have at least equivalent and indeed improved properties compared to, for example, the tri-ammonium citrate-dextrose system of WO 2007/014236. WO 2007/014236 teaches binder systems based, inter alia, on a combination of a carbohydrate (for example a reducing sugar), ammonia and a carboxylic acid and suggests that a Maillard type reaction may form the basis of the curing chemistry. It would have been thought that the nature of the acid used would have a significant effect upon the properties of the cured binder, particularly if the acid precursor and/or a derivative therefrom is incorporated into the structure of the cured binder. It is thus surprising that an acid precursor derivable from an inorganic salt should provide a suitable acid precursor in an otherwise apparently similar binder system., 50897=The reaction of the binder upon curing may be essentially a Maillard type reaction as described for example in US Patent Application 20070027283 or WO2007/14236. The binder may comprise polymerisation products of a mixture that comprises a reducing sugar and a material selected from the group consisting of ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate and ammonium carbonate.}",
