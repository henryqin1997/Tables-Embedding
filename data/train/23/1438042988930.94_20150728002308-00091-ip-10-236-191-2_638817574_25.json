A Shell bundle dedicated to Joram administration OW2 Project JORAM Keywords Java EE, JMS, OSGi, Shell, Administration, OSGi RFC-147, Felix Gogo, Joram Description Felix GoGo is a reference implementation of the OSGi Alliance specification for \u201cCommand line interface\u201d (known as RFC 147), and it defines an extensible shell service. Since release 5.3 Joram is now designed with an OSGi based services architecture to provide a dynamically adaptable messaging server. The goal of this project is to provide a dedicated Command line interface (CLI) for Joram JMS provider. This CLI will define command for Joram administration and monitoring, it could provide multiple user interfaces: textual, graphical, etc. References: Joram: http://joram.ow2.org Felix Gogo: http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-gogo.html Project contact person and e-mail Andre Freyssinet, ScalAgent D.T.
