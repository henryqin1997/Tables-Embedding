    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck The prices for this school are decent and I love the way financial aid works. Before you go to the bookstore you get a little slip of paper saying how much you have in your financial aid account & what all you can spend it on. I have been enrolled here a full year now and have not spent a penny on my school. Am enjoying being here I love the area that the Virginia Beach campus is is. It's easy to find & it's just ten miles from the ocean front! The only problem I have had is that one evening my car was broken into in the TCC parking lot, but nothing was stolen. Am learning a lot So far, all but two of my teachers that I have had were wonderful. If you are majoring in sociology or Microsoft Office I would research your teachers hard before signing up for your classes.
