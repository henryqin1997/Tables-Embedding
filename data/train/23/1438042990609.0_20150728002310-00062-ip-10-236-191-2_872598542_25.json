If it cannot be guaranteed the initial 10 inputs from the first user can be accurately reported, report the first user\u2019s 10 inputs as up and stop reporting all inputs. It is acceptable to immediately begin reporting the initial 10 inputs after the inputs from the second user are removed. Under no circumstance should the reporting of the original users inputs be random and or switch between the users."

If the device appears a mouse, pen and touch features will not be enabled, and the mouse input requirements will apply. Pen digitizer requirements are as follows: Pen digitizers must appear to the operating system as HID pen digitizers and not as mouse or other proprietary devices. Sample rate must be at least 100 Hertz. Resolution must be at least 600 pixels per inch and at least five times the display resolution. While hovering within 5 millimeters, the pen's position and the position that the device reports must be within 2 millimeters of each other. This accuracy requirement applies whether the input is stationary or in motion. The physical contact with the device and the contact position that the device reports must be within 2 millimeters of each other. This accuracy requirement applies whether the input is stationary or in motion. Touch digitizer requirements are as follows: Touch digitizers must appear to the operating system as HID",
