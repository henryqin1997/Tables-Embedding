In June 1938 the average old age assistant grant was $9.51. In June 1940 the average grant had increased to $10.10. The national average grant per aged recipient is $19.96. North Carolina is ninth from the bottom in average grant paid to old age assistance recipients in the United States and territories., 210494=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the year 1938-39 juvenile courts in 45 counties were assisted in caring for a total of 88 children through county funds and the state boarding home fund. This number was 23 more children than could be helped in the year 1937-38. Forty-six of the 88 children received this aid for the full year. Thirty-three children were accepted for care during this period and 23 were transferred to other types of care. Seven of the 88 children are state wards and six of these wards received full maintenance from the state fund., 4132=Source Description: (series) Biennial Report of the North Carolina State Board of Charities and Public Welfare (title page) Biennial Report of the North Carolina State Board of Charities and Public Welfare, July 1, 1938 to June 30, 1940 (running title) Biennial Report State Board of Charities and Public Welfare North Carolina State Board of Charities and Public Welfare 181 p.

In addition to directing and maintaining the central application personnel service the responsibilities have been increased by the following developments: the biennial election of county superintendents of public welfare was held in June 1939, with sixteen new appointments and eighty-four reappointments; in August 1938 ninety-two qualified workers were located and placed on county staffs for a temporary period of work, and were paid through special WPA intake funds; job descriptions for all state and county welfare workers were drafted and compiled in the fall of 1939; while the last two months of the biennial period have been devoted to participation in the classification plan in connection with the merit system., 1972131=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since July 1, 1937, and increasingly in recent enrollment periods, young men have been selected principally because of their ability to contribute to and profit by work of the Corps. Destitution is not the badge of eligibility for enrollment. Despite the fact that the local, 17614=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. McAlister is known as the father of North Carolina's county unit welfare system. Before his appointment to the board, as president of the North Carolina Conference for Social Service 1915-1916 he had been in correspondence with persons of recognized authority in other states on the development of a suitable plan for North Carolina, and after his appointment the 1917 General Assembly authorized the present county unit system of state-supervised, local administration of North Carolina's care of its unfortunate., 1078698=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In close co\u00f6peration with the National Committee for Mental Hygiene the training and experience of various psychiatrists were reviewed and the present director, James Watson, M.D., was appointed January 1, 1940. In the interim Dr. J. W. Nygard, who had been associated with Dr. Crane and had also rendered valuable service to the state in other positions, was acting director. Dr. Nygard took charge of the interstate transfer of patients, made many psychological tests, held advisory consultations, helped the division of institutions and corrections check up on 3,000 county home inmates, visited the state mental hospitals, and gave much psychological service to the state correctional institutions., 2076026=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consultant was named by Governor Hoey as a member of the State Committee on Organization and Planning, Southern Governors' Conference Campaign \"For Balanced Prosperity in the South, 1940-50\"; advisory committee, Adult Education program. He is a member of the advisory committee to the National Youth Administration and the Raleigh Housing Authority, and recording secretary of the Committee for the Development of Psychopathic Hospitals and Other Mental Hygiene Resources for Negroes., 227955=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the year 1939-40 with the juvenile courts of 40 counties participating, a total of 84 children were cared for in licensed boarding homes through state and county funds. Forty-seven of these children received this aid for the entire period. Nineteen of the 84 children were transferred to other types of care during the year and 15 children were accepted for care. Seven of the total number of children are state wards and six wards received full maintenance from the state fund., 88839=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tables on population of institutions caring for dependent children, shown below, are based on the annual reports of the respective institutions for the years 1938 and 1939., 1166679=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A study was made of the amounts granted to the 171 persons leaving the county homes and getting old age assistance grants during the twelve months February 1, 1938, to February 1, 1939. Twenty-one received a total grant of $30 per month, and a total of 55 received as much or more than the $16.90 average per capita monthly costs of the county home care for 1939. An additional 55 received monthly grants of $10 a month or less. The average grant was $15.32 or $1.58 less than it cost on an average to keep persons in a county home., 1165286=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The total population of the county homes has shown a slow but steady decline since the beginning of the period of definitely anticipated public assistance in the state. In December 1936 there were 3,164 persons in the homes, and almost every month has shown a slight reduction. On June 30, 1940, there was a total of 2,650 persons in the 75 homes. Up to June 30, 1939, as many as 293 persons had moved out and received old age assistance alone. If the number moving out to receive blind assistance and aid to dependent children be added, it is seen that the public assistance program has been the major factor in the population reduction. It is interesting to note that of the 293 moving out for old age assistance, sixteen finally gave up the grants and returned to the county homes., 1395984=larger number of workers each year have taken additional training. This is shown by the number of junior case workers who have qualified for case workers. In June 1939, there were 144 junior case workers, fifty-eight case workers, nine case work supervisors, seventeen child welfare assistants, eighty-two case aides, and in June 1940 there were 121 junior case workers, ninety-one case workers, seven case work supervisors, fifteen child welfare assistants, seventy-nine case aides. The local boards have been responsible for determining the time and length for educational leaves in order that the work of the department would not be curtailed or handicapped., 989506=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A special work of appreciation is extended to those who planned the program, to those who developed it through the conduct of special discussion groups, and to all those who participated in any way and who thus helped to make the Public Welfare Institute of 1939 one of outstanding excellence.\", 1131743=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On June 30, 1940, Jackson Training School had a population of 437 and a capacity for 500. Eastern Carolina Training School had a population of 119 and a capacity of 150. Samarcand had a population of 167 and a capacity for 200., 1971143=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Act of Congress, June 30, 1937, emphasized conservation and set up a three-fold program--\"to provide employment, to provide vocational training, and to perform 'useful public work in connection with the conservation and development of natural resources of the United States, its territories and insular possessions'.\", 209253=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fund of only $7,500 per annum is inadequate to meet all the requests for this aid received from the counties, but an effort is made to distribute the grants among the counties making application as widely and evenly as possible without upsetting plans for children already receiving aid. In the late winter of 1938 a survey was made of the number of children in care of county departments of public welfare and juvenile courts who were in need of this type of foster care. Forty-three counties of the total 100 answered the questionnaire, listing 392 children and estimating approximately $44,000.00 as the sum--state and county funds combined--needed to care for them at a boarding rate of less than $10.00 per month. On a 50-50 basis the state's share of such a sum would be $22,000.00, but an appropriation of $15,000.00 only was requested of the General Assembly of 1939, believing that the full $22,000.00 could not be absorbed. The appropriation of $7,500.00, however, was not increased, 27221=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because of cramped quarters and lack of adequate room for a central filing system, it was a physical impossibility to set up this vast and much-needed improvement until the staff offices were moved into consolidated quarters in a new office building in December, 1938., 1156615=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The composition of the 1939 jail admissions was broken down to show the percentage of women in the total commitments. The white women made up 7.8 per cent of the total whites, while the Negro women made up 16.2 per cent of the total Negroes. The women of both races constituted 10 per cent of the total incarcerations., 305340=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In June 1940 there were 35,694 recipients of old age assistance., 164942=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Asheville Orthopedic Home was licensed on July 14, 1939, to care for crippled children and has at present a maximum capacity of 20. In addition to meeting minimum requirements for a child-caring institution set up by the State Board of Charities and Public Welfare, this institution must also comply with regulations of the State Board of Health relative to facilities for care of crippled children. The institution is the first of its type in the state, is well-equipped and is operated according to excellent standards., 982985=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The present division of the Public Welfare Institute into general sessions, each in charge of an expert in the particular field, supplemented by special discussion forums was initiated in 1938. Since it appeared eminently satisfactory and well adapted to the purposes of the institute, the same general plan was continued in the 1939 institute. Such a set-up provides not only for a detailed discussion and interpretation of philosophies and practice in certain general fields of social work and public welfare, but attempts to help members of the institute work out specific problems and procedures by pooling experiences, through special discussion forums. However, without discussion and participation by all, such a program is valueless, since the recipient gains only in the measure of that which he gives, and only in this way can a high level be reached and maintained., 308571=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In June 1938, a total of 7,375 families with 20,605 children received aid to dependent children. In June 1940 there were 9,352 families with 23,291 children receiving aid to dependent children. Whereas, in the nation 27 children per 1,000 estimated population under 16 years of age receive aid to dependent children grants, in North Carolina only 18 children per 1,000 estimated population under 16 years are recipients of this fund., 1098399=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Talks have been given to the following organizations: N. C. Orphanage Association, Rotary Club, Junior League, county welfare staff, private social agency board, parent education group, Durham Crime Club, N. C. Mental Hygiene Society, N. C. Neuropsychiatric Association, senior class of nurses, group of elementary school principals, Business Club, Y.M.C.A., state board study group, and a graduate class at the University of North Carolina. The psychiatrist was leader of a section on \"Child Placement\" at the Public Welfare Institute on October 8, 1939, and is serving as chairman of the committee on mental hygiene of the N. C. Conference for Social Service. He has participated in district public welfare institutes, child welfare institutes and home and family-life education institutes., 1152072=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A sampling of the ages of persons incarcerated in county jails was made to determine the age groupings of that series of law violators. See table 3, page 131. The study showed that 33.9 per cent of them were under 25 years of age and two-thirds were 25 or older. The ratio of older persons was higher among the jail admissions than among the prison admissions. The statistics throughout indicate that the increase of crime among the younger people is little or none. The increase in prison admissions during the period from July 1, 1932, through June 30, 1938, was more than 33 times greater among the prisoners 25 years and over than it was among those under 25 years., 2109117=Return to Menu Page for Biennial Report...1940 by North Carolina State Board of Charities and Public Welfare, 187491=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following tables list maternity homes, capacity and license status for 1939-40 and statistics on population movements for the years 1938-39 and 1939-40:, 76030=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following tables give license status of instutitons for the year 1939-40:, 1143245=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The number of children confined in the county jails of the state has steadily dropped. The problem of children in jail has received much attention from county and state officials, as well as from the lay public and the press, since October 1933, when the attorney general ruled:, 1977120=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Civilian Conservation Corps celebrated its seventh anniversary the first week in April 1940, and this occasion provided the CCC with an opportunity for a public inspection of CCC camps throughout the United States. Thousands of persons visited the camps and newspapers ran special articles; radio programs were broadcast and splendid results were achieved as a result of co\u00f6perative effort between selecting agents and camp officials., 17285=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ALEXANDER WORTH MCALISTER has been a member of the State Board of Charities and Public Welfare for almost a quarter of a century. Twenty-four years ago he succeeded his father on the board in December, 1916, and thus entered on an active official career in welfare work., 26735=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, about 25,000 records of the state board from its inception in 1869 to 1919 will be prepared for proper filing. Not a normal activity of the department because no budgetary funds were provided for the work, the assistance of the Work Projects Administration was necessary. The project consequently has given employment to approximately ten needy, educational, professional and clerical workers for more than a year., 68601=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All members of the staff attended various social service conferences held within the state during the biennium, and in 1939 several members attended national and regional conferences. Members of the staff, 1176471=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the last report a drastic reduction has been made in the personnel of the division staff. At the beginning of the biennium the staff consisted of a director, field agent, four social workers for services to the correctional schools, and five secretary-stenographers, or a total of eleven. The social workers and their secretaries were paid through child welfare service funds, and six of them were discontinued on August 31, 1938. The field agent was released for lack of state appropriation on June 30, 1939. At present the staff consists of a director, secretary, and a social worker at Morrison Training School. The latter is paid jointly by the school and child welfare service funds. The division is trying to execute all the duties it was carrying when the staff was largest., 22423=of the Social Security Board with respect to personnel administration in state agencies. Since January 1, 1940, the North Carolina State Board of Charities and Public Welfare has submitted a merit system plan to the federal agency, setting forth rules and regulations for a merit system in conformity with the Social Security Board's draft rule. Classification and compensation plans which constitute a part of the merit system have been formulated by a committee from the staff in consultation with a technical adviser from the Society Security Board. A merit system council has been appointed, composed of three public-spirited citizens of recognized standing and of known interest in the improvement of public administration and in the impartial selection of efficient government personnel. One of the main functions of the council will be to establish general policies for the administration of merit examinations. They also have the responsibility for recommending the appointment by the state agency of the merit system supervisor., 2062544=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The training of the Negro workers in North Carolina compares favorably with that of other groups. At present there are available a number of well trained workers, due to the fact that there are far more trained workers than available jobs. During the school year 1938-39 and 1939-40, there were fourteen North Carolina Negro students matriculating at the Atlanta University School of Social Work. Out of a graduating class of twenty-nine, at that institution in June 1940, nine were from North Carolina. Other graduates represented every section of the nation. On the staffs of the county welfare departments, where Negro workers are employed, other institutions represented are the New York School of Social Work, Pittsburgh University School of Social Work and the School of Social Work at Catholic University, Washington, D. C., 46178=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* One additional field social work representative was added July 1, 1940., 1170734=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The county homes have been from their origin a sort of \"catch-all\" for the mentally and physically unfit of all ages. With the gradual emergence and development of specialized care for many groups--as the tuberculars, the mental defectives, mentally ill, orthopedic, and the recipients of public assistance, the residual is the more or less chronically ill. Adequate medical and nursing care cannot be economically supplied where there are less than fifty beds for each unit, and it is preferable that the units not be smaller than 100 beds. The average population of the county homes now in operation is thirty-five. Only thirteen have a population of fifty or more, while only five have a population of as many as 100 at present. It is evident that adequate care cannot be economically supplied under the present arrangements. During fiscal 1938 it cost an average of $213.12 to maintain a person in a county home, while the average state hospital cost was $191.98 or 11 per cent less., 1971655=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This law established the basic principles under which the CCC operates. Only July 1, 1939, the CCC became a unit of the Federal Security Agency. Later that same year Congress reaffirmed the Act of June 30, 1937, and said, \"The provisions of this act shall continue until July 1, 1943.\", 82673=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* On February 1, 1940, the National Orphans' Home of the Junior Order United American Mechanics became the Children's Home of the North Carolina Junior Order United American Mechanics. Prior to that time the home was owned and operated by the National Council of the Junior Order United American Mechanics serving a national area, but when the state council of the Junior Order United American Mechanics, which is subordinate to the national council assumed ownership and control of the home, the policy was changed to serve North Carolina children only., 1150910=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1933 the 7,328 persons under 25 years admitted to the state prison made up 50.1 per cent of the total 14,617 prison admissions. This group under 25 has contributed a progressively smaller percentage each year, and has shown an increase in actual numbers of only 124. The group of prison admissions aged 25 and over has shown a, 1163474=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the passage of the federal social security act, and directly accountable to the operation of the act in the state, eleven of the counties have closed their county homes. Mitchell County closed in April 1937, but in anticipation of the coming of the old age assistance program., 344747=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Not corrected through June by deleting cancellations., 1080914=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"...The children's unit within the division of mental hygiene was organized early in the fiscal year of 1939-40 and the staff includes a part-time psychiatrist and a full-time psychologist. The psychiatrist serves mental hygiene clinics in two urban areas who reimburse the state board for his services. Approximately one-half of his time is available for child welfare services. His services to mental hygiene clinics has a two-fold purpose; that of offering treatment to children not otherwise having access to a psychiatrist, and that of broadened interpretation that comes through this service. Funds paid in by the two mental hygiene clinics are used in the development of the statewide mental hygiene program. The psychiatrist is available for consultation to the case consultants in the state office and occasionally to the child welfare services cases on a treatment basis in addition to his consultation services., 1402019=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In planning the programs of the six conferences the director is assisted by the district conference officers, and open forums and discussions are developed around the individual needs and problems of each district. The contributions and participation of county officials, members of the legislature, welfare board members, and civic leaders in the community have made the forums an important feature of the programs. Through the field social work representative the director has assisted in planning and co\u00f6rdinating the local arrangements. In the fall of 1938 \"Public Welfare--a Democratic Process,\" was the theme of the six conferences, and open forums on state and county relationships in the public welfare program, the working relationship between county officials and the county welfare department, and public assistance, were held during the morning sessions, with an address by the commissioner of public welfare, and a message from the president of the state association of county superintendents of public welfare. The luncheon sessions were devoted to the theme, with the following speakers: Governor Clyde R. Hoey, Attorney General Harry McMullan,, 1990617=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the seven-year period, April 1933 to April 1940, there have been selected and enrolled in North Carolina 57,706 junior enrollees (between the ages of 17 and 24). The total number of men being furnished employment as of January 1, 1940, was 7,625. The total number of men enrolled from North Carolina serving in CCC as of June 30, 1940, was 6,420. During the current enrollment period July 1-31, 1940, the Civilian Conservation Corps is offering 2,805 North Carolina men an opportunity to enroll in CCC camps as replacements for men who have left to accept employment or who have completed their terms of enrollment., 12563=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sir: I have the honor of handing you herewith the report of The North Carolina State Board of Charities and Public Welfare for the biennial period dating July 1, 1938, through June 30, 1940., 1147943=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Children are violators against property rights in from 48 to 50 per cent of the instances. They are charged with violations of the liquor laws in from five to six per cent of the instances. Twelve per cent of the children in jails during 1938 were held in jails two or more times during the year., 1406910=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The state committee on councils of social agencies appointed in 1936 has been one of the chief factors in stimulating interest in councils. The members of the committee furnished the material for a handbook on councils which was compiled by the director and made available to the one hundred county welfare departments, private agencies and, 1150372=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not the post-adolescent and young adult who are the chief contributors to the criminal population of the state, regardless of the many statements to the contrary. Those persons 25 years of age and over made up more than three-fifths of the prison admissions in 1938, and more than two-thirds of the county jail admissions during the four months from last November through February., 73636=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the winter of 1939 a conference for caseworkers of orphanages and members of the staff of the division of child welfare was held in Raleigh for the purpose of clarifying relationships and more completely co\u00f6rdinating respective services of the public and private agencies., 1151614=phenomenal increase by comparison. The actual numbers in the older group increased from 7,289 in 1933 to 11,421 in 1938, an increase of 4,132. Although the older group made up only 49.9 per cent of the total 14,617 admissions in 1933, they made up 60.5 per cent of the total of 18,873 admissions in 1938. See table 2, page 131, for a detailed break-down., 1014489=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(* Early in July 1940 the NYA lowered the age of youths eligible for certification to 17 years for North Carolina. The basis of certification was redefined as follows: The youth shall be eligible for certification if he is in need of employment, work experience and training.), 1005130=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the 1938-39 series of institutes emphasized social work theory and practice, the institutes of 1940 were set up with the objective of studying public welfare laws and the social security act and relating these to the function and limitations of the job. Not only the county superintendents, but the case workers also were invited to attend. During the first two hours the institute studied the social security act, the public assistance laws of North Carolina growing out of the act and the policies and procedures being followed., 3515=Text transcribed by Apex Data Services, Inc.

It has been compiled for the information of the Governor, the legislature and for the tax supporters of the state generally. Appropriations were made to the state board to administer the public welfare program in the state and as trustees of the funds, the board, through its staff members, has set forth somewhat in detail the activities of the various divisions in justification of its biennial expenditures. Public service, it is recognized, is regarded as a public trust. In attempting to meet human needs those who are engaged in public welfare work have been entrusted with a grave responsibility., 1149432=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All is not dark. There are facts in the figures which indicate that progress is being made. The trend of delinquency appears to be downward, not upward. As noted above, there are fewer children incarcerated in county jails than heretofore. The same is true of the especially provided juvenile detention quarters of a few centers over the state. The number of commitments to these quarters fell from 1,221 in 1937 to 1,168 in 1938 and down to 1,040 in 1939. This represents a reduction of 14.8 per cent. The training schools for delinquents are receiving fewer applications and are experiencing a falling population. The aggregate population of the training schools for delinquents has descended from 1,061 on July 1, 1933, to 894 on July 1, 1940. This represents a 15.7 per cent reduction., 320855=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* At the time allotments were made for old age assistance for the year 1939-40 it was estimated that $300,000.00 of the appropriation of $1,500,000.00 would be required to pay pensions to those Confederate widows who were not transferred to old age assistance., 1145075=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is excellent evidence that the practice now is away from using the common jail as the place to detain children. The figures for jail commitments for the past four years clearly demonstrate this. In the calendar year 1936, a total of 1,231 children were confined in county jails of the state. The number was reduced by 15 per cent to 1,070 for 1937. There was a further reduction by 17.5 per cent to 883 for 1938. During 1939, there was a further reduction to 784, or an additional reduction of 12.6 per cent below the preceding year. Thus in 1939, there were confined in jail 447 less children than in 1936, or 36.3 per cent below that year. We may expect to reach a point of diminishing returns at some early date. For the past few years, it seems that more children have been permitted to go to their own homes or homes of others pending disposition of their cases., 1009698=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October 30, 1939, the following joint working agreement was signed by the Work Projects Administration and the State Board of Charities and Public Welfare., 1391968=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The director has attended the annual meetings of the North Carolina Conference for Social Service in 1939 and 1940, the annual meetings of the North Carolina Council of Youth Serving Agencies, the southern regional conference on guidance and personnel held in Raleigh in January 1940, and the fourth round table conference of the American Public Welfare Association, Washington, D. C., December 1939., 1969119=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the biennium 1938-40 there have been many changes in emphases for the purpose of the advancement of the service of CCC selection. A complete summary of recollections about the birth of CCC selection in April 1933 and the many changes which have occurred would require too much for inclusion in a biennial report but the growth of the selection procedure especially during this biennium has been so rapid and interesting that it is deemed entirely proper to include in this report a brief summary of the most important changes and developments which have occurred., 2064499=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two annual public welfare institutes for Negro social workers have been conducted during the past biennium at St. Augustine's College, Raleigh, N. C. The conference theme for the 1939 meeting was \"Negro Youth and Juvenile Delinquency\"; and for 1940, \"Community Responsibility in Individual Readjustment.\", 1079544=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, through the aid of the federal Children's Bureau, the state board was able to realize another part of its plan and organize a children's unit within the division of mental hygiene. As director of this unit there was appointed June 1, 1939, Dr. R. F. Richie, a physician eligible to practice medicine in North Carolina, with some years experience in general psychiatry and a thorough training in child psychiatry in a Commonwealth Fund fellowship. Miss Mary Scovill, a psychologist holding a graduate degree in clinical psychology and with some years of training and work in institutions for both normal and abnormal children, had been appointed November 1, 1938. In June 1939 she became the psychologist of the children's unit. The following paragraphs from the plan of the child welfare services as approved by the federal authorities indicate the relation of Dr. Richie and Miss Scovill to the division of mental hygiene., 2069109=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no institution for young female offenders. For a number of years the Federation of Colored Women's Clubs operated a small inadequate institution, known as Efland Home for Negro girls. Toward this effort the state gave a small grant. Other revenue came from private gifts, which during the past few years of the depression were meagre. Through an agreement between the state board and the board of Efland Home, the school was closed about two years ago. It was a fire hazard and inadequately staffed. It is hoped that the General Assembly of 1941 will establish such an institution which has been so long neglected by the state, thus making the four-point program for youthful offenders complete. This step together with that of providing, 305163=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In June 1938 there were 33,060 recipients of old age assistance., 1403828=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fall of 1939 \"Public Welfare--A Public Service,\" was the theme for the conferences, with open forums on service through the boards, service to youth, public welfare--a sound investment, and the job itself, were held during the morning sessions, with an address by the commissioner of public welfare, and a message from the president of the state association of county superintendents of public welfare. The luncheon sessions were devoted to the theme, with the following speakers: Governor Clyde R. Hoey, Honorable D. Hiden Ramsey, general manager of the Citizen-Times, Asheville, and Commissioner of Paroles Edwin Gill., 26161=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One activity that, when complete, will add greatly to the efficiency of operation of the state office is the project begun in the fall of 1939 to establish a central filing unit to replace seven independent filing systems developed in the course of years. This WPA-aided operation will cover approximately 200,000 cases representing twenty years of department activity from 1919 to 1939, with the cases being filed and cross-indexed according to a standard system to promote speedy, efficient and accurate handling., 21857=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Social Security Act as amended August 10, 1939, required that the state public assistance agencies must include, after January 1, 1940, a provision for methods relating to the establishment of personnel standards on a merit basis for a merit system of personnel administration. A draft rule was therefore issued by the Social Security Board on November 13, 1939, to all state welfare departments, the standards included therein representing the minimum requirements, 29034=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the social security program came into North Carolina the work of the department was expanded to such an extent that space was required in five different buildings located in the Raleigh business district. It was only with the final move into the present quarters in December 1938, that the various divisions of the expanded department were brought together into efficient working space that had so long been needed., 1395428=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the state board found it necessary to extend the time limit from 1941 to 1943 for securing the required social work training, a, 24309=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every effort has been made in the interest of economy and efficiency to integrate the newer services--public assistance, referral and certification services in connection with WPA, CCC, NYA, and surplus commodities--with the older services that had been established a number of years prior to the initiation of the social security program. The field social work supervisors, for instance, serve as representatives for the various divisions within the department, thus coordinating the work on the local level. The auditing division, established in 1937 at the time the public assistance program was established, serves the entire department through a centralized accounting system, which operates in conformity with the regulations and requirements of the state Budget Bureau. The statistical unit which came into existence when certifying services in connection with the various federal programs became the responsibility of the state board,, 4780=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The electronic edition is a part of the UNC-CH digitization project, Documenting the American South. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text has been entered using double-keying and verified against the original. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text has been encoded using the recommendations for Level 4 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Original grammar, punctuation, and spelling have been preserved.

W. Crane resigned in September 1938 in order to give the whole of his services to the University of North Carolina. At this time the State Board of Charities and Public Welfare decided to put into effect a plan which had received much consideration. This was to secure as the new director a physician eligible to practice medicine in North Carolina and with extensive training in psychiatry including at least three years practice in mental hospitals and two years in community clinics. In addition he would be required to hold a diploma by examination of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology., 1167367=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Table 6, page 133, shows a county by county tabulation of average populations and costs of county homes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1939., 1137028=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About 1933 the State Board of Charities and Public Welfare undertook to serve as the clearing house and supervising agency for these children. It was believed that helpful supervision and aid could be supplied. The county superintendents of public welfare of the respective counties are by authority of C. S. 5017 the actual supervisors of all such persons., 66199=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the report for the biennium of 1936-38, the work of this division was defined as \"emphasis on responsibility for (1) care of children outside their homes or in substitute or foster homes (2) special case-work service to children who, though living with their families, present personality and behavior problems; (3) improvement and enlargement of facilities for foster care; and (4) joining forces with all agencies in the children's field in a sincere, co\u00f6perative effort to determine what group of children in the state are most negleced by both the public and the private children's agencies and how the child welfare program can be adapted to care for their needs.\", 1399783=term, while in May 1940 the two previously appointed members selected the third member for a three-year term., 1983470=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the fiscal years 1938-1939, a total of 12,648 young men have been enrolled in North Carolina, the regular quarterly enrollments occurring in July, October, January, and April of each fiscal year to fill vacancies caused by discharges to accept employments and for other reasons. The enrollment by quarters for the biennium follows:, 211538=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table shows expenditure from both state and county funds for the year 1938-39:, 1147060=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Too often young children who are only dependent or neglected are confined in the jail because no other resource seems available. Of the children held in jail in 1937, 6.1 per cent were ten years of age or under, and in 1938, 4.6 per cent were ten or under. It is the common knowledge of those who visit jails that very small children are occasionally carried along to jail when the mother is incarcerated., 246591=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was an increase during the biennial period in the use of boarding home care for dependent, neglected and pre-delinquent children who either had no homes or whose homes were improper places for them to live. There is a growing recognition of the value of this type care as is shown by the increased number of licensed boarding homes in a larger number of counties. The Biennial Report 1936-38 shows that there were 57 approved homes in twenty-nine counties at the end of the period covered. The table given below shows that there were 71 approved homes in 32 counties and 32 additional homes in 12 counties whose applications are being considered at the end of this period covered. There is a great need for additional approved homes as is shown by the study made of the county home population on January 31, 1939, in which it was ascertained there were 97 children under 16 years of age among the 2,801 inmates. It is hoped that before the next biennium there will be no need to use this archaic type of care for our youth., 15914=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Blair is the fourth chairman of the State Board of Charities and Public Welfare since it was organized under direction of the constitution of 1868, and succeeded to the direction of its activities in October, 1904, after thirteen years' experience as a board member., 1132119=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The needs for the delinquent Negroes have not been adequately met. A new dormitory was erected at Morrison Training School during 1938, and the intake has increased to the extent that the waiting list and waiting period have been materially reduced. There is as yet no, 1148390=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to have the information relative to the quantity of work done by the juvenile courts up to date, the State Board of Charities and Public Welfare is making a state-wide survey of the activities of these courts during the past five years. Such surveys for the period from 1919, when the present juvenile courts were established, through 1934 have been made and the findings published. The present survey covers the number of cases heard by the several courts of the state during the period from July 1, 1934, through June 30, 1939. The breakdown will show the race, age, sex, type of misbehavior, and disposition by court and by year, as have the previous surveys. It is hoped that the survey will add other information as to what the youths of today are doing, and what is being done to them. The findings of the survey will be available for distribution about the first of the year., 23472=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Merit examinations under the above conditions will be held for state and local employees engaged in public assistance and child welfare services in the late fall of 1940, according to present plans., 58906=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In analyzing the work done by the field social work representatives during the past two years the most essential things to know are not that a time study made during the month of March, 1940, indicated that they spent approximately 53 per cent of their time conferring with county superintendents and local boards on problems of administering old age assistance and aid to dependent children, 22 per cent on WPA referral problems and so through the various items covered by the study; that the state office received from each field representative a report on each of his counties at least once a quarter, that he visited each county at least once a month or that he filed his work reports and expense accounts regularly and in accordance with requirements. Important as these may be it is much more important to know how and wherein he measured up to his responsibilities as representative of the state agency and as professional helper to the county departments of public welfare. It is well to remember in this connection that giving supervision is not superimposing, and that supervision is a two-way, 228783=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table shows expenditures from both state and county funds for the year 1939-40., 301938=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steady progress in the achievement of a sound administration of public funds for the needy aged and dependent children in North Carolina has been accomplished in the biennium 1938-1940. The division of public assistance auditing and statistical reports with respect to the disbursement of funds and data concerning public assistance recipients account to the citizens of the state for the funds appropriated for old age assistance and aid to dependent children. The figures represent the work of 100 North Carolina county boards of commissioners and 100 North Carolina boards of public welfare, of the North Carolina State Board of Charities and Public Welfare and the federal Social Security Board--local state and federal bodies engaged in administering the old age assistance and aid to dependent children titles of the Social Security Act, passed by Congress in August 1935 and the old age assistance and dependent children act enacted by the North Carolina General Assembly in March 1937., 1973193=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On July 17, 1940, an extension of the CCC eligibility standards was issued to all state selecting agencies. The modified regulations were transmitted with Official Letter Number 25 from the division of selection in the office of the director again emphasizing the consistent development of the Corps as a program of work experience and training for the widest possible group of unemployed young men of character, energy, and ambition., 1146099=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Confining children in jail pending a disposition of them has always appeared illogical in light of the fact that 42 per cent of them are released on probation when the case is finally heard. Less than half that number are sent to training schools or prison. Only 11.2 per cent of the 1937 children in jail were reported as sent to training schools or prison. In 1938, in a more careful follow-up, 19.4 per cent of those in jail were found to have been sent to training schools. Correspondence was had between the county and the training school in an additional 7.4 per cent of the total incarcerations, but so far as is known, in the remaining 73.2 per cent of the cases final disposition was made without resort to confinement following the hearing. The average period of jail incarceration is about ten days., 2070389=adequate facilities for Negro feeble-minded children, should take precedence over institutional life for Negroes during the General Assembly of 1941., 1974388=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is interesting to note that, since the Corps is no longer operating for the exclusive benefit of those who are on relief or eligible for relief, 67 per cent of all selections made, from July 1937 through January 1940, have represented families either receiving relief or eligible to receive relief. The Corps continues to serve its purpose in the alleviation of economic distress but it has become much more than an emergency program whose primary purpose is to provide financial assistance. It has been transformed into a work training agency and the efforts of selecting agencies are devoted to affording the privilege of enrollment to dependable, mature, and alert young men who have an honest desire to obtain a job training opportunity., 1164143=gram. Two others closed before the beginning of the present biennium: Cherokee and Chowan, each on June 30, 1938. During this biennial period seven others have closed: Greene on September 30, 1938; Yancy, November 30, 1938; Swain, May 30, 1939; Transylvania, July 31, 1939; Cumberland, August 31, 1939; Polk, January 1, 1940; and Madison, February 5, 1940., 2005690=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Extensive recreational facilities have been provided in the national and state parks and forests of this state. In the park and recreational field CCC has made its greatest contribution toward conservation of natural and human resources. The Hanging Rock, Mount Morrow, Mount Mitchell and Cape Hatteras State Parks are outstanding examples. The increase of 100 per cent in state park acreage since 1933 has resulted almost entirely from the encouragement to expansion taken by the state from the availability of CCC man-power and funds for development., 1398959=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The director has kept a current directory of the county board members and chairmen and it has been encouraging to note the few resignations and changes which have occurred since the organization of the boards in 1937. In May 1938 the state board appointed a member on the one hundred county boards for a term of three years; the same month of 1939 the commissioners appointed a member for a similar, 309121=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In June 1938 the average grant per family of children receiving aid to dependent children was $16.17. In June 1940 the average grant paid was $16.64. The national average grant paid in aid to dependent children is $32.19 per family. North Carolina is fifth from the bottom in average grant paid to aid to dependent children recipients in the United States and territories., 28733=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Five years later, in the early fall of 1926, the department moved into the building provided for the department of agriculture where it stayed for twelve years, the longest time it has occupied any quarters since leaving the capitol building., 202845=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the biennium of 1936-38, a total of 2,640 cases were referred. Therefore, the increase of new cases in the biennium of 1938-40 was 11-plus per cent over the number of the previous biennium., 450275=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Corrected through June, 1939., 66972=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the biennium of 1938-40, the work of the division centered in the above four areas, and this report will summarize or record some results., 1227876=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (15,000 admissions chosen as a sample of some 28,000 total admissions to county jails during November, December 1939, and January and February 1940.), 68165=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two of the case consultants at two different periods have had educational leave of several months each during which they attended schools of social work. Two of the case consultants attended a seminar course in the summer of 1938, the director of the division a seminar course in the summer of 1939, and the supervisor of the special child welfare services area in June 1940., 15137=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the years subsequent to his appointment as a member in December, 1891, Mr. Blair has seen many changes come into being in the North Carolina welfare program. Sterilization of mental defectives, an expanded mental hygiene program, improvement in county jail facilities, a boarding home fund to assist juvenile courts in caring for certain dependents, abolition of apprenticeship of children by indenture, replacement of county chain gangs by a state prison system, discarding of the practices of farming out prison labor and of working women on the public roads, parole and probation facilities, social security legislation--all have come into being during the years of his chairmanship or connection with the board., 305517=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In May, 1940, North Carolina reported payment to 255 recipients per 1,000 estimated population 65 years and over. This number is larger by eight than, 299958=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. That the sum of $15,000 be appropriated for the state boarding home fund for each year of the biennium of 1941-43., 1164607=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are prospects of others closing some time in the near future. Camden County now has no one in its home, but it has been retained for meeting any needs which might arise. An additional nine homes had a population of less than ten persons on June 30, 1940., 300775=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. That provision be made in the annual budget or appropriation to the State Board of Charities and Public Welfare for the division of child welfare to absorb at least ten per cent of the cost of the state staff of the child welfare services unit of the division which has been financed in full by a grant or allotment of the social security fund for child welfare services by the children's bureau, U. S. Department of Labor, since April 1936. This program is regarded as a demonstration program and one to be absorbed gradually by state as well as county departments., 203134=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to service on the 2,933 new referrals, service was continued on an estimated 1,000 old cases active on July 1, 1938., 1110036=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the field of mental abnormality this is the outstanding need of the state. The Governor's Commission of 1936 estimated that there are at least 27,734 mentally defective white children in the state. Caswell Training School has an enrollment of 750. This means that approximately twenty-seven thousand white mental defectives are scattered throughout the state making trouble for communities and seriously hampering school programs. Many of these with adequate training opportunities suited to their limited ability, might develop into self-supporting citizens and others to partially self-supporting., 1387813=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the completion of the organization of the one hundred county welfare departments in July 1937 the emphasis in the work of county organization has been placed on securing adequate qualified personnel on county welfare staffs, promoting understanding of state and county board relationships, securing the active interest and participation of county boards in interpreting and promoting the public welfare program in the counties, and in enlisting the co\u00f6peration and support of county officials, social and civic groups through county councils of social agencies and the six district welfare conferences., 74388=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the winter of 1939, the director of the division collaborated with the director of the division of adult education, State Department of Public Instruction (since nursery schools which are laboratories for parent education are located in this division) in the development of a committee on standards and supervision in pre-school education. The State Department of Public Instruction is interested in the work of such a committee because of the nursery school program and the State Board of Charities and Public Welfare because of the day nursery program. In April 1939, through this committee a statewide conference on standards was held. This conference was attended by representatives of kindergartens, nursery schools and day nurseries. This group decided it was interested in the general supervision of all pre-school education in the state through the department of public instruction. Therefore if an enabling bill is enacted by the General Assembly of North Carolina giving the State Department of Public Instruction responsibility for supervision of pre-school education, this, 1977745=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the responsibility of selecting agents to keep the public and prospective applicants and their families properly informed of the opportunities and requirements of the Corps. Recently selecting agents acting in co\u00f6peration with all other co\u00f6perating agencies have helped splendidly in the endeavor to inform the public accurately of the nature of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The \"open-house\" activities in connection with the seventh anniversary celebration and the April 1940 enrollment which occurred during the same month furnished a wonderful opportunity for selecting agents to contribute to the good results achieved by the \"open-house\" program., 27548=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The present quarters embracing nearly the whole of the fifth floor of the largest state office building represent the fourth home of the department since it was established. During the years following the legislature of 1869 when the work of the department was handled entirely by the secretary to the old Board of Public Charities, office space was allotted in the Capitol. Even after reorganization of the old board into the present State Board of Charities and Public Welfare by the 1917 General Assembly to provide for a commissioner to direct the administrative work of the department, the Capitol still provided office space for four years until the first move in December, 1921., 45207=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In January 1936 the field social work service of the State Board of Charities and Public Welfare was established for the purpose of serving as general staff for all divisions and services of the state office in their relationships with the county departments of public welfare. The field staff which originally consisted of five field social work representatives was increased as the state board and the county departments of public welfare were given additional responsibilities. From July 1, 1937, through June 30, 1939, the counties of the state were divided among ten field representatives. Effective July 1, 1939, funds were available for only eight field representatives, the average number on the staff from that time until June 30, 1940. The eight field representatives and the counties assigned to each as of this date are as follows:*, 296428=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A. At least two quarters social work training in a school of social work if the worker plans to complete at least six months additional social work training in an accredited school of social work not later than January 1943. and earlier if possible.**, 1172237=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many people are going to continue to need institutional care. The care in those institutions, if it is to approach adequacy, must include more medical and nursing care than is now supplied. These more adequate services can best be supplied when the plants are so planned and the units are sufficiently large to warrant the employment of adequate and competent personnel. The consolidation of smaller county units seems the inevitable answer. Chapter 129 of the Public Laws of 1931 gives the necessary legal authority. Circumstances will eventually develop the practice., 16243=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He witnessed the reorganization of the old Board of Public Charities into the organization of today when the 1917 General Assembly re-vamped North Carolina's program to allow for expansion into the numerous activities supervised today by the state board.}",

The nation must have strong military and naval forces, adequately trained and equipped; yet it must be realized that the economic, physical, spiritual and social well-being of the people as a whole is really its first line of defense.
