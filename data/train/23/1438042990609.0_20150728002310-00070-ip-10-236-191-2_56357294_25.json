The key to the drive was a 4th-and-7 from the Philadelphia 49; Kitna did his best impression of Vick, dodging several pass rushers before scrambling for 10 yards. Two plays later, the ball was in the end zone with 4:22 to play., 73838=Jon Kitna threw for 242 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions for the Cowboys (4-9), who assured themselves of a losing season for the first time since 2004. Jason Witten caught two touchdown passes among seven receptions and 69 yards, while Felix Jones ran for 41 yards and a score on 13 carries.}",
