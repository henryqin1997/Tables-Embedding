All car dealerships have a mandatory dealer fee that they HAVE to charge ALL customers by state law. Some dealerships have been known to charge more than $1000.00, but we keep our fee as low as possible. Our dealer processing fee is $375.00 and covers the preparation of the vehicle, a professional detailing, the preparation of documents, filing tax, title and registration forms, and the expenses of maintaining inventory. Vehicles titles may be held by banks or lenders as collateral for loans. In many cases there may be a delay in receiving the original documents up to 21 days from the time we pay a vehicle off. While we usually have all titles in our possession at closing, there are rare occasions where we may be waiting for them to arrive. All titles will be overnighted at our expense if that is the case. Out of state buyers are responsible for all state, county, city taxes and fees, as well as title/registration fees in the state that the vehicle will be registered., 269671=Shipping The buyer is responsible for shipping and/or pickup of the vehicle. All shipping charges are the buyer's responsibility. We will assist the buyer with finding a shipping company and usually save our customers hundreds of dollars when shipments are booked through our broker - call us at 954-972-2277 for more information. We deal with both \"open\" and \"enclosed\" transport trucks. If the vehicle is going to be shipped, full payment must be received before the vehicle is delivered to the shipping company. We will not be responsible in any way for claims arising from shipping damage. Shipping companies have insurance policies that protect buyers against damage. If you choose to pickup the vehicle yourself, we can meet you at our local airport. This service is free of charge; however, we do require advance notice. Also, certain additional state fees, such as Florida state sales tax, may/will apply if the vehicle is delivered within the state of Florida regardless of the residence of the buyer. It is very common for shipping to be a more cost-effective option when weighed against all the actual costs for picking up the vehicle in person.}",
