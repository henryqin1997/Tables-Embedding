            "So far, I think Kishwaukee is a pretty good school, but as a transition. The education is too easy sometimes, and most of the teachers are okay, though they could be better. Always beware with community colleges, because it's really easy for people to get comfortable in them, which isn't good since this is supposed to be more of a transition step."

The campus itself is pretty enjoyable with lots of free activities and things in the main lobby most of the time. Tips for prospective students I encourage you to take classes that interest you in addition to just those that fill your required slots. You might not have another opportunity to take classes you like at this kind of price. Doing this also gives you a chance to become more well rounded and might even strengthen your resolve to be in a certain field or even change it dramatically. Bang for the buck It's simple: Kish is a community college. There's no dorm to pay for and its inherently cheaper because it is a community college. Tuition itself can be paid for by a few scholarships and it saved",
