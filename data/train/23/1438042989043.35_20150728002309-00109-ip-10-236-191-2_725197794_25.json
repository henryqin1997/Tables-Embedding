But hey, Hamilton has a shiny new stadium!, 43763=Winnipeg by 5 Calgary by 9 B.C. by 21 Toronto by 8, 92229=Toronto by 8 B.C. by 12 Hamilton by 10 Saskatchewan by 18, 153047=Toronto @ B.C. (Friday, September 19) Life just doesn't get easier for the Argos. After a Calgary collapse, they move on to a battle in B.C. Place. The Lions have won two straight and have their eye on second place., 52004=posted by DrJohnEvans at 03:53 PM on June 29, 168480=Saskatchewan @ Winnipeg (Sunday, September 7) Welcome to the horse race that is the West division. A seventh straight win for Saskatchewan could put them in a tie for first. A redemption win for Winnipeg could move them from a crossover spot to second place. Saskatchewan's been riding their defence all season, but this will be their first trip to the new turf in the 'Peg., 122714=Ottawa @ Hamilton (Friday, October 17) Wait, even Ottawa's not eliminated yet? It's true! Although they will be with a loss, or a Toronto win. But they're going up against a decent Hamilton team that's coming off a crushing loss and looking to get back in the saddle, so maybe this ain't the Redblacks' year., 130572=Hamilton @ Toronto (Friday, October 10) It's the revenge of Zach Collaros: cut loose by the Argos, he's found a niche with Hamilton and is making things interesting. With Hamilton leading the division by a game, this is a key game for Toronto heading into the home stretch., 176195=Ottawa @ Montreal (Friday, August 29) Yikeswhich team is in worse shape? Ottawa's lost five in a row, Montreal six. Good thing they're getting this game over with first., 59476=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:54 PM on May 19, 23928=Calgary @ Ottawa (Friday, July 24) Two teams headed in opposite directions: Calgary's won two in a row and looks comfortable atop the West, while Ottawa's lost two straight and is having a tough time looking cohesive. Big money is on Calgary, but those in search of excitement may want to take the underdog., 66356=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:27 PM on December 03, 16273=Calgary by 21 B.C. by 7 Winnipeg by 4 Hamilton by 2, 15797=posted by DrJohnEvans at 11:40 AM on July 27, 167954=Calgary @ Edmonton (Saturday, September 6) Edmonton seriously fumbled their chance to take the division lead last week. It's early for must-win games, but another loss against Calgary would put the red-hot Stamps up four points in the division race., 3820=So basically they don't have to sell the farm and go for broke in 2015. I think it's a smart deal., 154371=Edmonton by 17 Calgary by 21 B.C. by 8 Saskatchewan by 14, 177670=posted by DrJohnEvans at 02:50 PM on August 22, 130871=Ottawa @ B.C. (Saturday, October 11) All of a sudden, Ottawa has a win, and B.C. has lost three in a row. What universe is this? Still: Vancouver is Vancouver and that turf is tough on visitors., 115107=Montreal @ Ottawa (Friday, October 24) Nobody is more surprised than Montreal to find themselves tied for first, and with a short trip down the 417, they could take another step towards securing that first round bye. Ottawa's toast, of course, but beware the youth? Maybe?, 66917=posted by DrJohnEvans at 02:36 PM on November 28, 52587=posted by DrJohnEvans at 01:56 PM on June 23, 153288=Edmonton @ Hamilton (Saturday, September 20) This one could be interesting. Edmonton is the obvious favourite, but have revealed flaws in their game. Hamilton's the underdog, but are undefeated in their new stadium., 146373=B.C. @ Calgary (Saturday, September 27) Calgary looked like world beaters with Mitchell at the helm, but so far Drew Tate hasn't been able to keep that momentum in place. Are they vulnerable? The visiting Lions will be a good test., 160937=Winnipeg @ B.C. (Saturday, September 13) Poor Winnipeg: a thoroughly respectable season has landed them in the basement. But B.C. lives on the first floor, so if the Bombers want to move up, now's their chance., 153910=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:56 PM on September 16, 131091=Saskatchewan @ Montreal (Monday, October 13) I don't even know what to think anymore. Saskatchewan had a chance to grab the division but lost it when Durant went down. Meanwhile Montreal has strung together a couple of wins and is very much in the mix for a home playoff game. What do you think: is Jonathan Crompton the man to bring glory back to Montreal?, 3574=So now they still need pitching, but the increase in offense means they can be more reasonable in acquiring pitching. And they've made themselves more competitive in 2016-17, while punting their aging-shortstop problem down the road., 51725=Toronto @ Saskatchewan (Sunday, July 5) Toronto hopes that the Trevor Harris Magic continues for another week. Meanwhile, Saskatchewan looks to rebound after a nasty loss last week - with 834-year-old Kevin Glenn taking the snaps., 108034=B.C. @ Edmonton (Saturday, November 1) This is interesting: if my math is right, B.C. is still in the mix for a home playoff game. But they need to win this game by at least seven points to keep that dream alive. It's young upstart Mike Reilly against wiley veteran Kevin Glenn. Should be fun!, 109268=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:15 AM on October 23, 80867=Just like they drew it up: the best offence in the league against the stingiest defence in the league. Calgary will bring QB Bo Levi Mitchell and RB Jon Cornish against the Eskimos' strong and healthy d-line. When healthy, Calgary's been the class of the West for the entire year, but we are in November now, and weather can have a huge impact on offense. Keep an eye on that forecast., 139225=posted by DrJohnEvans at 05:45 PM on October 01, 138958=B.C. @ Hamilton (Saturday, October 4) Verrry interesting. You'd think that B.C. should get the edge, but the Lions are coming off a couple of tough losses, and a resurgent Hamilton's undefeated in their new digs. Hmmm., 72920=Hamilton Tiger-Cats (9-9) @ Calgary Stampeders (15-3) (Sunday, November 30), 123391=Calgary @ Winnipeg (Saturday, October 18) Oh, Winnipeg. Remember July? Yeah, me too. But you've lost six in a row now, and Calgary's coming to town. The Stamps can clinch the division with a win, while likely eliminating the Bombers from contention., 100541=posted by DrJohnEvans at 08:19 AM on October 30, 168229=Hamilton @ Montreal (Sunday, September 7) Both these teams finally bagged their second win of the season last week. The team that's the first to three will pull into a tie for first. Yes, the East has been that bad this year., 147185=posted by DrJohnEvans at 04:24 PM on September 20, 82927=B.C. Lions (9-9) @ Montreal Alouettes (9-9) (Sunday, November 16), 130421=Heading into Thanksgiving weekend, every single East Division team has a winning streak. Just like we all predicted back in August, right?, 138630=Edmonton @ Toronto (Saturday, October 4) Is there life in Toronto? A win in B.C., followed by a much-needed bye to rest the wounded, followed by an Edmonton team that's been inconsistent. But part of that inconsistency involved shutting out Saskatchewan last week, so Ricky Ray's gotta be on his guard., 4467=posted by DrJohnEvans at 10:49 AM on July 28, 146653=posted by DrJohnEvans at 12:56 PM on September 25, 153529=Calgary @ Montreal (Sunday, September 21) Calgary's on a nice little roll but lost QB Bo Levi Mitchell to an ankle injury last week. Can Drew Tate carry on the momentum in Montreal?, 58565=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:41 PM on June 22, 145819=Saskatchewan @ Edmonton (Friday, September 26) The West just got close again. Steady Edmonton can tie the Riders for second with a win, but Saskatchewan can tie for first if they can steal two points at Commonwealth., 51115=Calgary @ Montreal (Friday, July 3) Here are two 0-1 teams which everyone expected to be 1-0. Calgary's the stronger team, but Montreal's no slouch, and they should have QB Jonathan Crompton back after suffering a shoulder bruise last week, which should at least make things interesting., 160682=Toronto @ Calgary (Saturday, September 13) Two more streaks: Toronto's lost three and Calgary's won five. If you're ranking good places to break out of a streak, McMahon Stadium won't be high on that list. Especially in the snow., 169522=posted by DrJohnEvans at 02:36 PM on September 01, 81862=posted by DrJohnEvans at 04:11 PM on November 19, 33094=Hamilton @ Montreal (Thursday, July 16) The Ti-Cats, fresh off a bye, roll into Montreal, fresh off hoping that Rakeem Cato can do the job. After a sparkling 3-TD debut, Cato was held off the board last week, but kept his team in the game with 317 yards thrown. Montreal hopes he can keep that up, because there's noone else to play., 13428=B.C. @ Winnipeg (Thursday, July 30) Here's a coupla teams in some disarray. B.C. had a win in the bag before letting it all slip away, while Winnipeg got flat-out embarrassed, so they've both slid down the standings. The winner this week gets a head start on the climb back up., 80774=Edmonton Eskimos (12-6) @ Calgary Stampeders (15-3) (Sunday, November 23), 176390=Winnipeg @ Saskatchewan (Sunday, August 31) Speaking of five in a row, that's how many Saskatchewan's won. And yet they're still tied for third with Winnipeg. The loser of this game will find themselves four points, and three teams, back of first., 145595=Montreal @ Ottawa (Friday, September 26) Who would've thought this game could be intriguing? A resurgent Montreal could move into first with a win, and even Ottawa is looking competitive these days., 108353=Toronto @ Montreal (Sunday, November 2) More jostling for position: a Toronto win would move them into a tie with Montreal for first place. But the vivid memories of an uninspired Argos loss at the hands of the Alouettes two weeks ago haven't faded, and a Montreal win this week would seal the division race in their favour., 16355=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:00 PM on July 23, 116137=B.C. @ Winnipeg (Saturday, October 25) Winnipeg extends their losing streak to seven in a row. If they make it eight, B.C.'s got themselves a playoff berth., 109185=Montreal by 10 Calgary by 8 Hamilton by 7 B.C. by 14, 98898=Edmonton @ Saskatchewan (Saturday, November 8) Saskatchewan's in the same boat as the Lions. Win and stay in the West, lose and cross over to the East. Edmonton, on the other hand, has locked up a home playoff date, and you can be sure they'll be resting their regulars., 124150=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:38 AM on October 16, 58241=Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Preview) @ Saskatchewan Roughriders (Preview) - Saturday, June 27, 8:00pm, 146061=Hamilton @ Winnipeg (Saturday, September 27) Two teams going in opposite directions: Winnipeg has lost their early-season shine and three in a row to boot, while Hamilton's won two in a row to get to the top of the East. Is there enough time in the season for another change in fortune?, 82427=posted by DrJohnEvans at 11:01 AM on November 13, 80025=Montreal Alouettes (9-9) @ Hamilton Tiger-Cats (9-9) (Sunday, November 23), 179434=Copyright \u00a9 2015 SportsFilter All posts and comments are \u00a9 their original authors., 108726=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:21 AM on October 29, 42824=Saskatchewan @ B.C. (Friday, July 10) Who thought this would be an early battle of the basement? It's early, but both teams need their D to step up in order to notch the first W., 115405=Saskatchewan @ Calgary (Friday, October 24) How the mighty have fallen. With Winnipeg's loss, Saskatchewan has clinched a playoff berth, but will an out-of-retirement Kerry Joseph carry them far in November? For that matter, can he even win a single game against a resting Calgary squad? I guess we'll find out this week., 176663=Toronto @ Hamilton (Monday, September 1) Hamilton finally gets their new stadium, AND a game against a divisional opponent! Unfortunately for them, it's Toronto coming to town., 123048=Montreal @ Toronto (Saturday, October 18) Battle for first! Montreal, Toronto, and Hamilton are in a three-way tie for first. But Toronto has an actual quarterback, while Montreal has... a lovely stadium and a decent ground game. Montreal's had a nice comeback run, but I don't think they have the fuel to sustain it., 85043=2014 Kicking Stats \u00bb, 154459=posted by DrJohnEvans at 06:22 PM on September 12, 124609=Hamilton by 8 B.C. by 10 Saskatchewan by 7 Edmonton by 16, 3944=posted by DrJohnEvans at 02:54 PM on July 28, 116342=posted by DrJohnEvans at 08:56 AM on October 22, 176865=Edmonton @ Calgary (Monday, September 1) The marquee game of the week. Both teams are 7-1, tied for first, and on a three-game winning streak. Winner takes all! ...until they play again next week, of course., 74729=posted by DrJohnEvans at 11:31 AM on November 23, 139770=posted by DrJohnEvans at 04:01 PM on September 26, 16933=posted by DrJohnEvans at 03:00 PM on July 22, 101727=posted by DrJohnEvans at 08:16 AM on October 30, 33453=Edmonton @ Ottawa (Friday, July 17) There's no sugar-coating it: Ottawa was flat-out embarrassed in Edmonton last week. But most of the damage was done early in the game - the second half was almost respectable. Ottawa hopes to build off that heading into the second half of the home-and-home., 107500=Hamilton @ Ottawa (Friday, October 31) After a tough loss in Toronto, Hamilton needs to win both of their last two games in order to secure a playoff berth. Fortunately for them, playing Ottawa is a good way to start a winning streak., 24261=Toronto @ BC (Friday, July 24) This one's a bit more even: two 2-1 teams who have maybe given up a few more points than they'd like, but have good results to show for it. Vancouver is a tough place for visiting teams, but if Toronto has good luck out west, it won't be the first time., 13731=Saskatchewan @ Edmonton (Friday, July 31) Both these teams lost their starting QBs to injury in Week One. Now Edmonton's in first place, and Saskatchewan's still looking for their first win. It's all about depth. Take the streak until proven otherwise., 177121=posted by DrJohnEvans at 10:23 PM on August 25, 2023=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:23 AM on July 30, 153736=Ottawa @ Saskatchewan (Sunday, September 21) Just got humiliated in Hamilton? What salve could be better than hosting Ottawa?, 60549=posted by DrJohnEvans at 08:08 AM on March 04, 116888=posted by DrJohnEvans at 02:14 PM on October 16, 160376=Montreal @ Edmonton (Friday, September 12) Opposite streaks: Edmonton finds themselves stuck in the middle after losing two straight to Calgary, while Montreal's won two in a row to tie for first. But the Esks still have a lot more pedigree this season than the upstart Alouettes., 138041=Winnipeg @ Ottawa (Friday, October 3) Finally, we get a true battle of the basement! Expansion Ottawa has lost nine straight, but has looked better lately. Winnipeg started strong but have fallen flat, losing four straight. Who's worse?, 6128=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:15 AM on July 28, 42157=Ottawa @ Edmonton (Thursday, July 9) Everyone who thought Ottawa would be 2-0 to start the season, raise your hands. Now everybody who thinks Edmonton can contend without a healthy Mike Reilly at QB, raise your hands. Something's gotta give here., 67623=posted by DrJohnEvans at 01:43 PM on November 27, 14659=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:51 PM on July 27, 167786=B.C. @ Ottawa (Friday, September 5) A well-rested B.C. team against a struggling Ottawa team that's lost six straight. I know who I'm picking., 131474=Winnipeg @ Edmonton (Monday, October 13) Edmonton pretty much has to win out if they have any hope of unseating Calgary for the division. But if that's your plan, hosting a struggling Winnipeg team isn't a bad way to start., 35350=Edmonton by 9 Winnipeg by 5 B.C. by 10 Calgary by 9, 43844=posted by DrJohnEvans at 08:52 PM on July 01, 50762=Hamilton @ Winnipeg (Thursday, July 2) After three years with no playoff appearances, Winnipeg may just be on the verge of contending again, but they'll have to string together a couple in a row before we believe it. Coming off a tough last-minute loss, Hamilton is hoping that the rebuild in the 'Peg isn't quite finished yet., 131746=posted by DrJohnEvans at 10:39 PM on October 08, 85976=Toronto digs deep and gets the win, but it's all for naught as Hamilton cruises to victory over Montreal, securing the division title for the Ti-Cats and eliminating the Argos. Out west, B.C. comes up short in a must-win against Calgary, relegating them to crossover status. And in one final bid to generate typos in the 2014 regular season, Saskatchewan wins., 34045=Winnipeg @ Calgary (Saturday, July 18) Here's an early battle of division leaders, and nearly the only two teams who still have their preferred starting quarterbacks. Calgary's been the legacy favourite for a while now, but this could be a statement game for Winnipeg as they try to finish off their rebuild., 99217=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:52 PM on November 05, 25658=posted by DrJohnEvans at 08:47 PM on July 21, 124697=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:16 AM on October 09, 14009=Montreal @ Calgary (Saturday, August 1) Speaking of depth, do you believe in Rakeem Cato? He's been piling up the yards, while the much-vaunted Bo Levi Mitchell threw but one touchdown in last week's Calgary loss. The Stamps are still the better team, but this one may be closer than Vegas wants it to be., 24571=Winnipeg @ Edmonton (Saturday, July 25) After a rough start, Edmonton has started to find its footing, while Winnipeg is probably lucky to be 2-2 that's not a great setup for anyone heading into Commonwealth Stadium. Edmonton gets the edge here until proven otherwise., 85487=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:44 AM on November 13, 161390=posted by DrJohnEvans at 03:25 PM on September 11, 97985=Ottawa @ Toronto (Friday, November 7) So here's the deal: Toronto needs to win. That, combined with a Hamilton loss, will get them into the playoffs. BUT Ricky Ray is out with a concussion, and the Argos have been anything but consistent. Can they pull it off?, 98271=Calgary @ B.C. (Saturday, November 7) Calgary's got the division title wrapped up and could use some rest. B.C., meanwhile, needs a win to avoid crossing over to the East. Although perhaps that route would be preferable. What would Kevin Glenn do?, 26209=posted by DrJohnEvans at 05:20 PM on July 15, 91761=posted by DrJohnEvans at 12:21 AM on November 11, 161939=posted by DrJohnEvans at 04:22 PM on September 04, 43028=Toronto @ Calgary (Monday, July 13) Toronto continues their Magical Mystery Pam Am Games Road Trip with a stop in Calgary, who just got flat-out embarrassed last week. But the big question is: do you believe in Trevor Harris?, 83768=Saskatchewan Roughriders (10-8) @ Edmonton Eskimos (12-6) (Sunday, November 16), 34894=posted by DrJohnEvans at 01:49 PM on July 10, 35432=posted by DrJohnEvans at 11:51 AM on July 09, 92317=posted by DrJohnEvans at 07:22 PM on November 06, 74138=posted by DrJohnEvans at 01:41 PM on November 27, 2662=posted by DrJohnEvans at 11:37 AM on July 29, 170053=posted by DrJohnEvans at 01:52 PM on August 26, 57906=Edmonton Eskimos (Preview) \"@\" Toronto Argonauts (Preview) - Saturday, June 27, 5:00pm - NOTE: GAME NOT ACTUALLY IN TORONTO BUT IN NORTHERN ALBERTA I KNOW WTF, 5304=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:20 AM on July 28, 62213=Calgary jumps out to a big early lead, but Hamilton throws up a late first-half TD to make things interesting. Calgary then busts out the Rich Stubler bend-but-don't-break defence, stifling Hamilton in the red zone as they kick 3 field goals to make it close. With the fourth-quarter clock at 1:12 and ticking down, Calgary punts to Brandon Banks, who runs a spectacular 90 yards for the go-ahead touchdown\u2014which is heartbreakingly called back on an illegal block. Calgary makes the most of it and hangs on for the Grey Cup win., 33772=B.C. @ Saskatchewan (Friday, July 17) Here's the definition of tough luck: Saskatchewan is 0-3, but only -9 in season points differential. With the home winds on their side this week, they're looking for some lucky breaks to start going their way., 139684=Montreal by 7 Saskatchewan by 3 Winnipeg by 9 B.C. by 8, 81493=2014 Passing Stats \u00bb, 138303=Calgary @ Saskatchewan (Friday, October 3) The two Western thoroughbreds, both without their startign QBs. Calgary's up by two wins with five weeks to play, but between now and season's end, they play Saskatchewan twice. They can all but clinch by winning this week, but that's no easy task in Regina., 98544=Montreal @ Hamilton (Saturday, November 8) The equation is simple: win and you're in. Lose, and you're not in, unless it's Montreal who loses, in which case both of these teams make the playoffs anyway. BUT if Hamilton wins by more than seven, they claim the division title and a first-round bye. Okay, maybe it's not so simple., 57383=Ottawa Redblacks (Preview) @ Montreal Alouettes (Preview) - Thursday, June 25, 7:30pm, 43302=posted by DrJohnEvans at 02:40 PM on July 07, 107760=Winnipeg @ Calgary (Saturday, November 1) Winnipeg's lost eight in a row and is looking for answers for 2015. Calgary's cruising with the division wrapped up and a four-game win streak to boot. Maybe TiVo this one and fast-forward through it later., 61715=posted by DrJohnEvans at 01:42 PM on January 27, 132242=posted by DrJohnEvans at 01:48 PM on October 04, 60032=posted by DrJohnEvans at 07:32 PM on March 22, 25104=posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:08 PM on July 21, 99772=posted by DrJohnEvans at 08:46 AM on October 30, 51428=B.C. @ Ottawa (Saturday, July 4) The last time Travis Lulay visited Ottawa, he shredded his shoulder and ended his season. I'm no expert, but he's probably hoping for a slightly better outcome now. On the other sideline, do you believe in the Redblacks' sophomore streak?, 168903=posted by DrJohnEvans at 11:30 AM on September 04, 24865=Hamilton @ Saskatchewan (Sunday, July 26) Remember a couple years back, when Saskatchewan started the season 5-0? They're one good Zach Collaros start away from starting this year 0-5. Ouch., 14340=Toronto @ Hamilton (Monday, August 3) It's a Pan Am reunion tour: Hamilton finally relinquishes control of its spruced-up home, while Toronto is forced to be vagabonds for one more week. But at 3-1 and with one of the best offences in the league, the Argos will take it., 57636=Hamilton Tiger-Cats (Preview) @ Calgary Stampeders (Preview) - Friday, June 26, 9:00pm, 123666=Edmonton @ Saskatchewan (Sunday, October 19) Here's the money game of the week. It's pretty much down to these two to host the division semi-final, and guess what? They play each other twice before the season's out. The Riders have fallen on tough times in the post-Durant era, while Edmonton's clawed its way into second place. Edmonton's got the edge until Saskatchewan can find its offence again, but should be a fun one regardless., 115752=Hamilton @ Toronto (Saturday, October 25) Ouch: Toronto's fallen off the pace for the East division lead, and find themselves potential crossover victims. But Hamilton's the team they're chasing, and they shocked the Ti-Cats a couple weeks back. That said, Toronto's been lucky if not good, and if they want to stay alive they'll need to switch that up a bit.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "A sophomore stunner in Ottawa as the Redblacks top the visiting Stampeders in overtime. Toronto spots B.C. a 21-point lead before coming all the way back to win in the last minute. In Edmonton, Winnipeg gets a first-quarter field goal, and then apparently they just got on the bus and went home. Saskatchewan puts up a fight at home, but comes apart in the fourth quarter to open the season 0-5. CFL Pick 'Em, Week Six posted by DrJohnEvans at 09:15 AM on July 28 Another copy/paste error! Sorry about that. Your total is correct in my spreadsheet, it just didn't make it into the table. Although it did make it into the weekly summary so hopefully that's worth something. Not to be a stickler but my point total should be 23 now (not 17). I may need those points in a couple of weeks/lol.
