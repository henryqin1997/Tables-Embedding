By adding a value of 0.0001 we are always smaller than 1/1000 and it now doesn't matter how many CSS files are added or not, the weight of the RTL file will always higher than it's LTR file and always smaller than the next LTR file. This make sure it really works as documented in locale_css_alter().}",
