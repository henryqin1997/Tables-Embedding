    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{85339=Exemplary descriptive statistics for the defined variables based on data about transactions between October 2004 and March 2005 are shown below in Table 1 herein:, 50497=For example, Kalyanam, K., et al., \u201cReturn on reputation in online auction market,\u201d Working Paper 02/03-10-WP, Leavy School of Business, Santa Clara University, 2001, presents the effects of online reputation systems on the price of Palm Pilots and PDAs, and Melnik, M. I., et al., \u201cDoes a seller's reputation matter? Evidence from eBay auctions,\u201d Journal of Industrial Economics, 50(3), pp. 337-350, 2002, describes the effects of online reputation systems on the price of gold coins. Both of these publications describe that positive feedback from online buyers increases prices, while negative feedback decreases prices., 111425=For example, the dimension-modifier pairs that appear in feedback profiles of less than 50 (out of the 1078 sellers in the collected data set) may be eliminated from consideration in step 530 since statistically meaningful results for such sparse dimensions are usually not extracted. In step 535, the dimension-modifier pairs to be used in regressions for the price premium variables, i.e., RegPricePremium and AvgPricePremium, can be identified., 80342=The compiled data set can contain, e.g., 1078 sellers, with an average level of experience of, e.g., 4,932 postings. Of the 1078 exemplary sellers in the data set, 122 of them successfully completed transactions during the exemplary 180-day period, while the remaining sellers acted only as participants in the market, without actually selling a product., 51965=The lack of consistency in the results described in these and other prior publications on the effects of reputation systems on the electronic market outcomes may be explained by a more robust measure of the value of reputation (e.g., a price premium, rather than simply absolute price) and a further exploration of the dimensions of reputation that may be found in a specific kind of qualitative information source, i.e., textual feedback. Pavlou, P. et al., \u201cPsychological contract violation in online marketplaces: antecedents, consequences, and moderating role,\u201d Information Systems Research, 16(4), pp. 272-299, 2005 describes that textual feedback is shown to influence price premiums and affect psychological contract violation in online marketplaces. The role of textual feedback in building buyers' trust on the eBay\ufffd online marketplace and how it affects price premiums is further described in Pavlou, P. et al., \u201cThe Nature and Role of Feedback Text Comments in Online Marketplaces: Implications for Trust Building and Price Premiums,\u201d published at http://www.agsm.ucr.edu/faculty/pages/pavlou.html, 2006., 51153=However, not all of the results in systems and publications are consistent. For example, Eaton, D., \u201cValuing information: evidence from guitar auctions on eBay,\u201d Working Paper # 0201, Department of Economics, Murray State University, 2002 describes the results which show that positive feedback from online buyers has no effect on the probability of sale or price of electric guitars and negative feedback reduces the probability of sale only for sellers with more than 20 feedback postings. Ghose, A. et al., \u201cEffect of electronic secondary markets on the supply chain,\u201d Journal of Management Information Systems, 22(2), pp. 91-120, 2005, describes the results which show that the online reputation of sellers has no significant or consistent impact on the prices of used books., 75315=As described herein, the data set may be collected over a particular period of time (e.g., 180 days between October 2004 and March 2005) for a particular (280) of individual software titles, with an equal or similar number of products from each of certain major software categories, e.g.: (a) Business/Productivity software; (b) Graphics software; (c) Development software; (d) Security/Utilities software; and (e) Operating Systems software.}",
