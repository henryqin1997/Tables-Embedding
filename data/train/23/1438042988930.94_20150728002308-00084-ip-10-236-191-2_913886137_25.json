Everyone around campus is so ready to help answer questions, or they know who can. It really makes it easy on us., 409044=This is definitely a university level school in terms of workload, however the consistency from one 2000 level course(or any level) to another can vary extremely., 27121=I am an undergraduate student, and a freshman at UT. For those high school seniors migrating here for 2014 I recommend you go on as many tours, incoming freshman events, and orientation, as soon as possible. There is so much to have done by the time you are expected to move in. UT is a convenient size campus, and takes about 15 minutes to get from one end to the other. If you can get acquainted and familiar with your locations and directions the first week of college will be a breeze! I also recommend you use that week to get familiar with the programs and work opportunities for those seniors looking for additional financial assistance in college. Remember, loans are helpful, but sometimes there are alternatives! UT is excellent when it comes to work study programs!, 81835=College is going to be expensive where ever you choose to go (unless you have a full ride) but this college applies your dollars honestly. They even have a lab fee (which covers the cost of printer paper) that is meant only for you. For example, you pay them $50 in the beginning of the semester and that gives you 1200 of paper to use for printing in the lab. They even let you see your account balance on every computer when you log in. That way, you know how much you have spent., 381782=The choices on and around campus are varied and geared towards college students. May be a little more pricey but good food nonetheless., 417722=Academic rigor will always vary among programs, but I've seen students here doing some pretty impressive work. Psychology students do original research, and linguistics students do field work. I've heard of anthropology students also doing fieldwork. Seniors in the engineering department are expected to present original designs. 1000-2000 level classes tend to be really easy, but you can still learn a lot from them. Upper-level classes can get pretty intense; class sized can get tiny, so there's a lot of contact with the prof, and you have to know your stuff., 121775=when i began attending here in fall 2008 the food was a lot better then it is now. they have tried to make a lot more healthy choices available for the students., 612779=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Comments Great for these types of students If you want great research opportunities, the University of Toledo is perfect for you. They have research opportunities for everyone. They even have a first year summer research experience that is just for first year students. They also have a great medical program and pharmacy program. Tips for prospective students Throughout the first week, go meet people! Don't stay hidden in your room. If there is any sort of bonfire or anything, go to it!! It will never be easier to make friends than it is in that first week. Another suggestion I have is to get involved. There are so many opportunities here but you will never find them if you are afraid to get involved. Attend meetings for clubs that you may think that you won't be interested in. Who knows? Maybe you'll find that you actually like doing something that you never considered. And, you may make friends there. Also, use your professors' office hours. Even if you aren't struggling in their class, go meet them. Let them know who you are and what you're interested in. They may tell you about exciting opportunities, such as study abroad programs. Plus, you never know if down the road you will need their help for a recommendation or something. Bang for the buck",
