    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{16113=I enjoy living on campus at Stevenson University. The residential halls are amazing. Everything is clean and organized, I feel very secure at this university. We are given ID cards to receive access to meals, on campus buildings and off campus stores for discounts. Th e social environment at Stevenson University is good; everyone is so welcoming and friendly. It is very easy to make friends at Stevenson University because it is a small campus so it is easier to know everyone. The athletic sports at this university is interesting because in the year of 2011 the first football team was formed, the soccer team and lacrosse was also popular at this university. We had a great homecoming in 2011, coming into the university as a freshmen is one of the most memorable experiences I will never forget., 145287=Studying is key, depending on the major more or less studying is required. For example a science major has maybe six science classes per week. For every one hour of a class you would want to dedicate three or four hours of study time on material for the week. Therefore you would want to dedicate 18 to 24 hours per week for the material. College is not easy, but if enough work, and effort is applied then you should be fine. The average student to teacher ratio is 17:1. Therefore, there is more one on one time for students to learn more effectively, and more time for the teachers and students to get to know each other., 67030=i would recommend that all students apply for this school before march. this school does offer scholarships but it takes about two weeks for your application is processed. applying earlier gives you time to ensure that the school can process all financial aid., 169869=There are two Main food places here on campus. one is called Rockland where it is an All you can eat buffet which closes at 7:00 pm and Pandini's which serves sandwiches, pizza, and pasta. Pandini's closes at 11:00 so, it is conveniently open later so if your are going to be up all night doing homework or just as a mid-night snack you are able to eat., 157602=Stevenson has two campuses and in fall 2013 there is going to be a third campus., 83037=Stevenson is a very safe place. They have emergency poles where you can call for help all over the parking lots and Stevenson vans drive around the campus 24/7. We also have to swipe to get in past 8 o'clock and if someone tries to get in who's not from they school, they will not be allowed to enter., 233045=There are a lot of events happening on campus. I personally work for Student Activities and we provide, in conjunction with other clubs and organizations, lots of fun things to do on the weekend and during the week. For example, we recently had a glow party and we are hosted a comedy show in February featuring Seth Myers from Saturday Night Live! This semester we are also holding a Staycation Weekend over Labor Day weekend with a whole bunch of water related events and giveaways., 142169=There is an annual movie night around halloween. The campus is split between Owings Mills and Greenspring however by the fall of 2013, every building/class will be moved to one campus making the transportation from class to class easy and convenient., 140004=There is also something for everyone at Stevenson, as far as joining a sorority, a fraternity is coming soon. One of the oldest sororities is the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. Tau Theta Chapter; founded on the campus of Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1908. It is the oldest Greek-lettered organization established by African-American college-educated women. Stevenson University's undergraduate chapter of AKA, Tau Theta, was chartered on April 3, 2011. Its members are distinguished young women who boast excellent academic records, proven leadership skills, and are involved in the community through service., 329942=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Along with that, there is free tutoring among most subjects.

They give comprehensive work that will help you succeed. Tips for prospective students Work hard, ask questions, get a tutor, and get your work and to work (class) on time. Make sure you don't put all your study into one bulge into three hours, but study for an hour then take a half hour break. Make sure when you read don't read it straight through, but read it meta-cognitively. And don't high-light your text books. Use a fine-point felt tip",
