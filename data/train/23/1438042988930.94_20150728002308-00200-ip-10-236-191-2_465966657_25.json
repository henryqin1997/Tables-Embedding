    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6103=In general, the drug delivery device stents of Examples I-III were prepared with dioxane, chloroform or other solvents and different amounts of sirolimus (0-30%) and radiopaque agents (0-30%) having different particle sizes (0.1-10 microns). The films were prepared from PLGA 95/5 and PLGA 85/15. Once prepared, the films were laser cut into different lengths and geometries, i.e., solid ladder, open lattice & hybrid, wound on a mandrel at temperatures above the glass transition temperature of the polymers and then mounted onto balloon catheters and deployed in a water bath at 37\ufffd C. The solid ladder devices, with about 30% radiopaque agents, exhibited the greatest visibility, whereas the open lattice stents exhibited the lower visibility due to lesser mass of the open lattice stents. Referring back to FIG. 1, a solid ladder PLGA 95/5 stent 1 a with 20% barium sulfate and 15% sirolimus is shown as balloon mounted 1 b, and in its cut length 1 c from the prepared film. The cut length 1 c of the stent is 30 mm, the balloon mounted length 1 b of the stent is about 20 mm, and the length of the deployed stent 1 a is 18 mm. FIG. 3 a-c shows similar length changes for the hybrid stent 3 a in its film cut length 3 c, its balloon mounted length 3 b, and its deployed state 3 a. The radial strength for the solid ladder stent 1 a in FIG. 1 a was about 20 to 25 psi, and the radial strength for the hybrid stent 3 a of FIG. 3 a was about 10 to 15 psi. The radial strength can be varied using amorphous or crystalline morphology, wherein amorphous stents will tend to have lower properties than crystalline stents.}",

The solvent mixture used to dissolve the polymer had little, if any, influence on elongation values. The addition of barium sulfate also had no influence on elongation values., 117021=In general, films prepared from the two grades (95:5 and 85:15) of PLA-PGA displayed similar physical properties:, 99270=A summary of the mechanical properties of the PLA/PGA films reported as an average over three test specimens is given in Table I below. Pure PLA-PGA films as well as films containing barium sulfate were tested. Of course, drugs or bioactive may be added as in earlier described examples. In general, films prepared from the two grades (95:5 and 85:15) of PLA-PGA displayed similar physical properties., 21767=This application is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While there has been shown and described what is considered to be preferred embodiments of the invention, it will, of course, be understood that various modifications and changes in form or detail could readily be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. It is therefore intended that the invention be not limited to the exact forms described and illustrated herein, but should be construed to cover all modifications that may fall within the scope of the appended claims. As with the earlier described stent drug delivery devices, different geometries of non-stent drug delivery devices formed by the various processes can also be achieved. After processing, the fibers, tube, films, discs, rings, or other geometry of the non-stent devices may be laser cut and/or braided into a desired shape or pattern. While the above described systems and methods of the invention have focused primarily on stent devices comprised of bioabsorbable polymeric materials with drugs and radiopaque materials added thereto, the artisan will appreciate that devices other than stents may as well be comprised of bioabsorbable materials with drugs and radiopaque materials according to the systems and methods of the invention. As with stents, the devices may take on different geometries according to the techniques used to form the devices, whereby melt compounded blends of bioabsorbable materials, drugs and radiopaque materials may be melt spun into fibers, compression molded into discs",
