    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{19131=Figures 1-4 document the effect of the embargo on net capital inflows, foreign liabilities, and the current account. Net capital inflows reversed to net outflows of approximately 2 percent of GDP per year. The current account reversed from an average of 2 percent of GDP deficit prior to the embargo to a 2.4 percent surplus during the embargo period. Foreign liabilities as a percentage of GDP fell from 53 percent prior to 1985, to 44 percent during the embargo period. The composition of the liabilities shifted from loans to portfolio investment, most likely, reflecting a 1987 debt renegotiation agreement that allowed foreign investors to convert loans into equity., 107778=The foreign liabilities data are obtained from the Balance of Payment section of the Reserve Bank of South Africa. Foreign Liabilities are defined as Portfolio, Direct Investment, and Loans invested by foreigners in South Africa. The vertical bars denote the embargo period estimated to be between 1985 and 1993., 4541=The financial crises that devastated the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America in the mid to late 1990s following the liberalization of their capital accounts challenged the conventional view on the economic effect of financial integration, and prompted a renewed research interest in the subject.2 Since then, several empirical studies have assessed the economic effect of capital account liberalizations with mixed resulting evidence. (see Edison et al., 2003 for a survey). Part of the challenge to resolve this issue can be traced to the difficulty in measuring financial integration as noted in Edison et al. (2002). The literature uses four broad measures., 145059=Figure 7:\u00a0\u00a0Real Output per Worker in 000's 1995 Rands, 69354=Some observers also attribute the failure of the trade embargo to the vague language of the trade sanctions, and others, to the lack of a commitment to enforce it aggressively (Journal of Commerce, 15 May 1990, 1A). For example, protectionist lobbies within the U.S. were reportedly active in shaping the items affected by the sanctions under the 1986 Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (CAAA). The selection of items reflected more special groups' interests than their ability to dent the country's economy (Lipton 1988, 52). Coal exports, one of South Africa's main export products, continued to grow in the late 1980's and earned vital foreign exchange well in excess of 3 billion rands in the late 1980's despite the embargo, placing coal second behind gold in terms of contributions to the balance of payments. This export growth in the face of sanctions suggested the inefficacy of the coal embargo (ILO 1992a, 1-12)., 74062=The government decisions to institute capital controls and to freeze some of the debt repayments contributed to containing the crisis. This is evidenced in the unexpected resilience of the stock market during the embargo period.7 After a brief and moderate decline in 1988, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Index recovered quickly and registered a continuous increase throughout the embargo period. The effect of major domestic policies undertaken during the embargo period contributed to containing, not causing, the fall in investment, capital, and output., 21865=In summary, consistent with historical accounts on the disinvesment, net capital flows which were positive prior to the embargo, reversed to net outflows during the embargo period, and the amount of foreign liabilities declined significantly. Reflecting, in part, the disinvestment, the current account reversed from a deficit to a surplus. When the sanctions were lifted, foreign investment returned to South Africa. Net capital flows switched from net outflows during the embargo to net inflows. The stock of foreign liabilities increased significantly in the post embargo period, and the current account reversed back to a deficit. Both the historical accounts of the disinvestment and the data on foreign investment support a reduction of foreign investment in South Africa between 1985 and 1993 reverting the country to quasi-autarky. The following section analyzes the effect, if any, of the financial isolation on fixed investment, capital, and output., 74761=The hypotheses that political instability within the country could have caused the fall in investment, capital, and output does not seem tenable. The political situation during the 1985-1993 period was unstable, but no worse than in previous years. The country risk measures for South Africa in Erb et. al (1995) indicate that the political and overall country risk level at the eve of the embargo was higher than the average risk level during the embargo period.8 Historical accounts of the apartheid regime, in support of these risk measures, indicate a wave of political and social protests within the country since the institution of apartheid in 1948- one of which resulted in the arrest of Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid leaders in 1964. For example, the political situation deteriorated in April 1960 during violent protests against new laws restricting the movements of blacks and minorities. In 1976, hundreds of minorities were killed during violent protests against inequalities in the educational system. In summary, the available risk data and historical accounts of the political situation do not support the hypothesis that increased instability caused the fall in investment, capital, and output observed in the data., 72106=The major policies adopted by the government during the embargo period do not support the hypothesis that domestic policy changes adversely affected the economy. At the beginning of the disinvestment in 1985, when the exchange rate (pegged to the U.S. dollar) collapsed, the government announced two major domestic policies to contain the crisis., 221903=Current Account data are obtained from the 2005 World Development Indicator database. The middle income countries, it is the GDP weighted average of the Current Account to GDP ratios for countries classified in the middle-income category by the World Bank., 70286=The vagueness of the language in which the trade sanctions were written further contributed to their ineffectiveness. The following examples illustrate. CAAA did not clearly define when a product is South African. Tuna shipped from South Africa, for example, was allowed in the U.S. as long as it was caught in international waters by non-South African fishermen. Also, lobster tails caught by South African fishermen in South African waters were also allowed in the U.S. if they were processed on non-South African vessels. Fabricated iron and steel of various types were permitted in Europe if their specific shapes were not banned by the European Commission's text on the products affected by the sanctions. The narrow definition of petroleum products allowed certain petroleum-based products to continue being shipped to South Africa despite the ban on exports of petroleum products. (Journal of Commerce, 15 May 1990, 1A)., 126107=The investment data are obtained from the TIPS available through the web site (http://www.tips.org.za). Investment refers to fixed domestic investment in buildings and construction works, transportation equipment, machinery and other equipment and transfer costs. The upper dotted line is the hypothetical path for investment assuming embargo period investment grew at the eight-year pre-embargo period average growth rate. The lower dotted line is the hypothetical path for investment assuming post-embargo investment grew at the embargo period average growth rate. The vertical bars denote the embargo period estimated to be between 1985 and 1993., 20345=With the removal of the economic sanctions and the reintegration of South Africa in the global economy, foreign investment in the country resumed. For example, the World Bank announced $1 billion worth of development projects for South Africa in 1993. The South Africa Reserve Bank estimated that capital flows switched from large outflows prior to 1994 to net inflows of approximately 2.6 billion rands ($730 million) in 1994, and to 16.6 billion rands ($4.6 billion) in 1995 (Wesso, 2001). The share of foreign portfolio investment in the JSE increased from 6 percent in 1985 to approximately 15 percent in 1994. At the end of 1995, South Africa had the largest weight in the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) global emerging market index (15 percent) and investible emerging market index (27 percent)., 85209=Lipton, Merle (1988). \"Sanctions and South Africa: The Dynamics of Economic Isolation\". The Economist Intelligence Unit Special Report No 1119. London: The Economist Publications Limited., 72463=First, it introduced a dual exchange rate system; a financial exchange rate and a commercial exchange rate. The new financial rand, used primarily for movement of nonresident funds, traded at a discount relative to the commercial rand. The objective of the dual exchange rate system was to discourage disinvestment, and it remained in effect until March 1995., 78415=The analysis indicated that during the embargo, which turned out to be a financial embargo, the average growth rates of investment, and capital and output per worker fell 2.8 percent, 1.2 percent, and 1.4 percent, respectively, below the average growth rates in the pre-embargo period. When the embargo was lifted in 1993, the average growth rates for investment, capital, and output rose 7.6 percent, 0.7 percent, and 2.9 percent, respectively, above the average growth rates during the embargo period., 161574=The trade data are obtained from the Trade and Industrial Policy Strategies Database available through the web site (http://www.tips.org.za).

The vertical bars denote the embargo period estimated to be between 1985 and 1993., 232517=7.\u00a0\u00a0The recent experience of emerging markets in Asia and South America reveal that reversal of capital flows usually result in significant declines in the stock market indices. For example, the Mexican market index fell by approximately 50 percent during the 1994 Mexican crisis, and by 20 percent in Brazil and Argentina in the same period. In the 1997 Asia crisis, the Hong-Kong and South Korean markets declined by 20 percent and by 70 percent respectively.\u00a0Return to text, 82105=Chettle, John H. (1982). \"The Divestment of South African Stock: Is it Practical, Desirable, or Constitutional?\" Paper submitted to Georgetown University Law School, Washington, October., 313=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers Number 839, September 2005--- Screen Reader Version*, 86824=Stiglitz, Joseph (2000). \" Capital Market Liberalization, Economic Growth, and Instability\" World Development, June, Vol. 28, No. 6, pp. 1075-1086., 76484=Figure 14 compares the current account to GDP ratio for South Africa to that of other middle-income countries using data from the World Bank World Development Indicator database.9 The figure indicates that the current account to GDP ratio of the middle-income countries remained in deficit between 1985 and 1993, and did not reverse in 1985 or in 1993 as in the case of South Africa. In addition, real GDP per capita statistics indicate that world output per capita grew on average by 0.63 percent between 1976 and 1984, by 1.32 percent between 1985 and 1993, and by 1.62 percent between 1994 and 2001. For the middle-income countries subcategory, the average growth rates for these periods were 0.78, 1.26, and 2.52 percent, respectively. For South Africa, the corresponding growth rates of output per worker were 2.2, 0.8, and 3.7 percent, respectively. In other words, output growth fell more during the embargo period and increased more in the post-embargo period in South Africa than it did in the world economy and in comparable middle-income economies., 17181=In addition to private companies, several countries and some U.S. states passed laws forbidding investment of municipal or state funds in companies operating in South Africa. In 1986, California announced a gradual disinvestment of its $11 billion held in companies with ties to South Africa. By the end of 1988, 23 states, 19 counties, and 79 cities had adopted various economic measures to distance themselves from South Africa. (Chettle 1982, 106-08; New York Times, 28 October 1984, A18; Los Angeles Times, 25 December 1984, A1; Lipton 1988, 23-24; Baker 61). In 1985, France also banned new investment in or loans to South Africa., 1986=The economic embargo imposed on South Africa between 1985 and 1993 brought the country closer to financial isolation. This paper interprets the imposition and removal of the embargo as financial autarky and financial integration `natural experiments', and studies the effects on the economy. The aggregate data indicate a decrease in the levels and growth rates of investment, capital, and output during the embargo period relative to the pre-embargo and post-embargo periods. To further rationalize the findings in the aggregate data, we calibrate a neoclassical growth model to the South African economy. During the transition to steady-state, we model the embargo by limiting the country's ability to borrow for a period corresponding to the duration of the embargo. The derived dynamics for investment, capital, and output support the view of a positive (negative) link between financial integration (isolation) and economic growth., 76133=The 1980s is mostly remembered as a period of sovereign debt crisis in the global economy. At the beginning of the embargo around 1985, several emerging countries were recovering from the crisis. We evaluate whether this global factor and others could have caused the distortions to the South African economy observed between 1985 and 1993., 3299=Between 1985 and 1993 the world imposed economic sanctions on South Africa to put pressure on its apartheid regime (a political system that granted different rights to citizens based on race). At that time, foreign investors withdrew their capital from the country and stopped making new investments in and loans to South Africa. As a result, net capital inflows declined drastically. In this paper, we exploit the unique reversion toward financial autarky during the embargo period and reintegration into the world economy in the post-embargo period to study the economic benefits of financial integration for an emerging economy., 14955=By 1985, total foreign liabilities as a percentage of GDP had increased from 53 percent to nearly 70 percent (the public sector held 37 percent of the liabilities, and the banking and non-banking sectors held the remaining 63 percent), and the composition changed. The share of FDI and portfolio investments declined to 25 percent and 13 percent, respectively. The share of loans, on the other hand, increased from 40 percent of total liabilities to over 60 percent; 70 percent of which was due to mature within a year. The shift in liabilities from FDI and portfolio to debt reflected, perhaps, foreign investors' desire to reduce their risk exposure in South Africa (in light of the prevailing fragile political situation), forcing the country to rely on loans rather than on FDI and equity capital to fulfill its investment needs. The government had, reportedly, facilitated foreign borrowing by reassuring foreign banks and by stabilizing the indebtedness through gold swaps, or by borrowing from the IMF., 21168=Figures 1-4 document the effect of the removal of the embargo on net capital inflows, foreign liabilities, and the current account. Capital flows reversed again from net outflows during the embargo period to net inflows of approximately 2 percent of GDP per year between 1994 and 2001. During the same period, the current account also reversed from a surplus during the embargo period to a 1 percent per year deficit. The effect of the post embargo inflows is also reflected in the stock of foreign liabilities. Total liabilities as a percentage of GDP increased from its 1985-1993 average of 40 percent to 63 percent between 1994 and 2001, exceeding the pre-1985 average of 53 percent., 16040=In September 1984, the ruling party in South Africa instituted a new constitution that established separate parliamentary chambers for Indian and colored representatives, and continued to exclude Blacks. The new constitution signaled an uncompromising position on the apartheid issue, and sparked widespread protests and riots. The unrest resulted in an intensification of economic sanctions and marked the beginning of the disinvestment period., 83795=Gollin, Douglas (1998). \" Getting Income Shares Right: Self Employment, Unincorporated Enterprise, and the Cobb-Douglas Hypothesis\", unpublished paper, Williams College, June., 6970=The last measure is based on official dates of stock market liberalizations. This approach, used in Henry (2003) and Bekaert et al. (2001), considers that the countries are more financially integrated after they open their stock markets to foreign investors. Both authors find a positive significant relationship between the liberalization of stock markets and growth in investment and output. (see Edison et al., 2002 for a detailed survey on various measures)., 154654=Figure 8:\u00a0\u00a0Real Exports and Imports of Goods and Services in billions of 1995 Rands, 14019=Prior to the 1985 economic sanctions, South Africa had an open capital account and foreigners invested in the country. The following statistics document the magnitude and composition of foreign liabilities (Foreign Direct Investment, Portfolio investment, and Loans) in the period leading up to the 1985 embargo., 125873=Figure 5:\u00a0\u00a0Real Domestic Fixed Investment in billions of 1995 Rands, 12729=In 1948, the Nationalist party assumed power in South Africa and passed legislations that instituted the apartheid system; a system under which citizens from different racial groups had different rights. The institution of the apartheid system prompted a worldwide condemnation and marked the beginning of sanctions against the country. The United Nations (U.N.) and several countries imposed various forms of sanctions on South Africa to end the apartheid regime. However, the economic sanctions did not intensify until 1985, and they continued until the apartheid regime was dismantled around 1993. In the remainder of the study, the period 1985-1993 is considered the embargo period. The choice of these dates is guided by historical accounts of the embargo and by the changes in economic variables such as foreign liabilities, net capital flows, and the current account., 230825=4.\u00a0\u00a0Bernanke and Gurkaynak (2001) estimated a labor share of 0.59 for South Africa. After correcting the estimate to account for self-employed workers based on recommendations in Gollin (1998), the share of labor increases to 0.62-0.63. The estimates of labor share obtained imply a share of capital between 0.37 and 0.41, consistent with the estimate in this study. Barro and Xala-I-Martin (1992), and Mankiw et al. (1992), note that a high capital share - around 0.75 - is necessary to obtain empirically reasonable convergence rates. Models that include human capital are able to justify such a high share. In this study, human capital is omitted. The presence of adjustment costs for capital can control the speed of convergence, and when set high enough, it delivers a reasonable convergence rate without the inclusion of human capital.\u00a0Return to text, 145279=Output data are obtained from the Trade and Industrial Policy Strategies Database available through the web site (http://www.tips.org.za).

The standstill reportedly affected $13.6 billion in debt or 60 percent of the country's total debt. South Africa, however, continued regular payments on its public bonds, debts guaranteed by the government, and outstanding debts to international financial institutions such as the IMF (Ovenden 1989, 85). In December 1985, the government was unable to reach an agreement with its creditors and extended the freeze on debt repayments until 31 March 1986. In March 1987, the government reached a three-year agreement with foreign banks on rescheduling its debt. Under the agreement, South Africa continued to service all its debt, and made principal payments as originally scheduled, and by June 1990, the country had repaid 13 percent of the total principal of debt in standstill. The agreement also contained two exit options, one that allowed banks to convert frozen short-term claims into repayable long-term debt, and another that allowed creditors to use claims to purchase equities in South Africa. (Financial Times, 25 March 1987, 1; Ovenden 1989, 91-93)., 19877=In 1989, the Prime minister suffered a stroke, and resigned unexpectedly. His successor initiated a series of reforms in the early 1990s that resulted in the abolishment of the apartheid system. Accordingly, the international community began to lift the sanctions. In 1992, the European Commission lifted its sanctions against South Africa. The United States, Norway, and India followed in 1993. In 1994, the remaining United Nations sanctions were removed., 77658=This paper exploited the 1985-1993 South Africa embargo to study the effect of financial isolation and integration on an emerging economy. The experiment is interesting for three reasons. First, it circumvents the need to measure financial integration. Second, because the country was integrated prior to the embargo, we were able to evaluate both the adverse effect of financial isolation as well as the benefits of financial integration for the same economy. Third, the imposition and removal of the embargo was not directly related to the country's economic performance, but to the desire to change its political regime. We can, therefore, interpret the embargo as an event less subject to the endogeneity encountered in some previous studies., 86643=Shapiro, Matthew D.

The results indicate that average growth rate of investment fell during the embargo period to -2.6 percent from 0.2 percent in the eight years prior to the embargo, and increased to 5.0 percent between 1994 and 2001. The average growth rate for capital also fell during the embargo period to 1.3 percent from 3.5 percent in the eight years prior to the embargo, and increased to 2.0 percent in the post-embargo period. Similarly, the average growth rate of output fell from 2.2 percent prior to the embargo to 0.8 during the embargo period, and increased to 3.7 percent after the embargo., 16496=Several foreign companies operating in South Africa decided to disinvest and/or stop making new investments or reinvestments of earnings in the country. For example, of the approximately 350-400 United States (U.S.) companies with direct investment in South Africa in January 1984, the Investor Responsibility Research Center estimated that seven withdrew in 1984 and 39 in 1985. During 1986 the pace quickened. Forty companies left and thirteen announced their intention of leaving. By June 1987, 39 additional firms had left or announced their intention of leaving. By mid-1988, only 136 U.S. companies reportedly remained in the country (Lipton 1998, 64; Baker 1989, 59)., 83106=Erb, Claude B., Campbell R. Havery, and Tada E. VIskanta. \"Political Risk, Economic Risk and Financial Risk\" Financial Analysts Journal, Vol. 52, 6 (November/December 1996), pp. 28-46., 18311=As a result of the economic sanctions, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated that $10.8 billion flowed out of South Africa from January 1985 through June 1989, including $3.7 billion in loan repayments to banks, $7.1 billion in other debt repayments and capital flight (GAO 1990, 12, 17). Similarly, Trust Bank (a South Africa commercial bank) calculated that the country had forgone nearly $14 billion in loans and direct investments between 1985 and 1990 in comparison to what loans and direct investments would have been had money flown in at the rate that had prevailed before 1985 (The Economist, 10 February 1990, 69).

In the first half of 1985, U.S. banks reportedly withdrew $1 billion. In the Fall of 1986, Barclays Bank (the largest British investor in the country) disinvested as well.
