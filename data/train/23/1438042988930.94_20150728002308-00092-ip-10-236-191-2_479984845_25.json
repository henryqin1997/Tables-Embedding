The actual dimensions of the openings can be varied depending upon the type of polymer used and the temperature at which it is applied to the fabric. Where NYLON 6\ufffd is used, the reinforcing fabric will preferably comprise plain weave fabrics having openings between the warp and fill yarns of about 0.10 mm2. A plain weave fabric having 16 warp yarns and 15 fill yarns per inch (e.g., 16\ufffd16) of 84 denier nylon 66 yarns having a fabric weight of 149 g/M2 (4.4 oz./yd2) is most preferred for use with NYLON 6\ufffd polymer. Such a material is commercially available form Highland Industries of Greensboro, N.C., U.S.A., 66228=where the weight ratio of resin:liquid perfume is from 2.5:1 down to 1:2.5. Examples of the resin component of the scented nail polish of PCT Patent Application No. 97/25018 are nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate-butyrate, ethyl cellulose, vinyl polymers, methacrylate polymers and acrylate polymers. PCT Patent Application No. 97/25018 does not expressly or implicitly disclose the fragrance control release system of our invention, whereby a fragrance substance is evolved from a polymeric film into the environment proximate said film by means of molecular diffusion at a permeation rate of from about 1\ufffd10\u22127 up to about 0.1 mg-mm/cm2-minute in a sustained and controlled release manner as measured by the \u201cFRAGRANCE PERMEATION TEST\u201d described, infra., 236889=FIG. 11 is a schematic diagram depicting a method for manufacturing a surface finishing article according to our invention, but also using the technique of U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,844 issued on Nov. 12, 1996, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein., 67657=More particularly, our invention is directed to a film which is an emulsifier-free, single phase, nonporous, continuous, permeable polymeric film which comprises a polymer and a fragrance substance located on the surface of a substantially planar solid or semi-solid support, e.g., a woven or non-woven fabric, a solid surface or the human epidermis, said polymeric film having two substantially parallel laminar surfaces, a first laminar polymer surface and a second laminar polymer surface, said second laminar polymer surface being juxtaposed with at least a portion of said surface of said planar solid or semi-solid support, e.g., a woven or non-woven fabric, a solid surface or the human epidermis, said polymeric film having a substantially uniform thickness of from about 1 micron up to about 150 microns, said polymeric film having entrapped and dissolved therein molecules of at least one fragrance substance in an initial weight ratio Ri of fragrance:polymer of from about 0.01:20 up to about 50:0.01, said fragrance substance being:, 90207=In addition, another polymer group useful in the practice of our invention is partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetates, also termed \u201cpolyvinyl alcohol\u201d with polyvinyl acetate as hydrolyzed to an extent of from about 73% up to about 99%. Such material is prepared by means of any of Examples I-XIV of U.S. Pat. No. 5,051,222 issued on Sep. 24, 1991, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein., 60441=Holzner, U.S. Pat. No. 4,803,195 issued on Feb. 7, 1989 discloses personal care compositions having deodorant or antiperspirant activity and containing in addition to an active deodorant or antiperspirant base, a perfuming base either in the form of an aqueous emulsion or in microecapsulated form. The perfume base of Holzner is combined with a film forming substrate and an emulsifying agent. The Holzner, U.S. Pat. No. 4,803,195 claims:, 331360=The non-woven web is readily formed on a \u201cRando webber\u201d machine (commercially available from Rando Machine Company, New York, N.Y., U.S.A.) or may be formed by other conventional carding processes. Where a spunbond-type non-woven material is employed, the filaments may be of substantially larger diameter, for example, up to 2 mm or more in diameter. The use of larger diameter fibers permits the employment of larger abrasive particles in the finished aricle. Useful non-woven webs preferably have a weight per unit area at least about 100 g/m2, and more preferably, about 250 g/m2. Lesser amounts of fiber within the non-woven web will provide articles having somewhat shorter commercial work lives. The foregoing fiber weights typically will provide a web, before needling or impregnation, having a thickness from about 6 to about 75 mm, and preferably, about 25 mm. Commercially available non-woven suitable for use in the invention include those identified in the Examples of U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,844 issued on Nov. 12, 1996 (Donovan, et al), the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein., 348341=The successive layers of the fabric 1126, the coatable composition 1136 and the non-woven web 1122, are passed between the rolls 1130 and 1132, which shape the composition 1136 by applying pressure to opposed sides of the aforementioned layers. The coatable composition 1136 is thereby forced through the pores or openings within the scrim 1126 and simultaneously smoothed over the outermost surface of scrim 1126. Rotating roll 1130 may be fitted with a removable surface sleeve (not shown) or it may be chrome plated or textured. Both rolls 1130 and 1132 are water cooled to a temperature sufficient to harden the composition 1136 as it passes between the rolls 1130 and 1132. Where the composition 1136 is NYLON 6\ufffd, the temperature of the roller is typically about 16\ufffd C. Where a textured or matte finish is desired for the polymer layer, the roll 1132 is coated with a textured material or is fitted with an appropriate sleeve to imprart the desired finish., 330050=The non-woven web comprises a lofty, open, low-density, fibrous, non-woven web made of suitable synthetic fiber such as nylon, polyester and the like. The web preferaby is capable of withstanding the temperatures at which impregnating resins and adhesive binders are cured without deterioration. The fibers of the web are preferably tensilized and crimped, but may also be contnuous filaments formed by a spunbond process such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,227,350 to Fitzer (the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein), for example. Fibers which are satisfactory for use in the non-woven web are between about 20 and about 100 mm and preferably between about 40 and about 65 mm in length and have a denier ranging from about 1.5 to about 500 and, preferably, from about 15 to about 100. It is contemplated that fibers of mixed denier can be used in the manufacture of a non-woven portion 1012 in order to obtain a desired surface finish. The use of larger fibers is also contemplated to permit the inclusion of larger abrasive particles within the articles of this aspect of our invention. Those skilled in the art will understand that the invention is not limited by the nature of the fibers employed or by their respective lengths, denier and the like., 247017=Referring to FIGS. 4C and 4D, FIGS. 4C and 4D set forth the fragrance diffusion evaluation system for determining the diffusivity and permeability of fragrance materials used in the practice of our invention. The test samples on blotters indicated by reference numeral 1001 are supported by support 1002 in container 1003 having opening 1004 to the atmosphere. Air flow through line 1010 is supplied from air supply 1005 through tube 1006, having pressure gauge 1007 measuring the air flow. Container 1003 has side wall 1012 through which temperature probe 1009 is located. Temperature probe 1009 is attached to temperature monitor 1008. Container 1003 has base 1001. The overall apparatus is indicated by reference numeral 1000. FIG. 4D sets forth a top view of the apparatus of FIG. 4C showing the use of two tandem chambers 1003 a and 1003 b. Container 1003 a is supplied with air flow through tube 1010 a having pressure gauge 1007 b in the air flow line. Container 1003 b is supplied with air flow through tube 1010 b with pressure gauge 1007 a in its line. Air supply from location 1005 supplies air through line 1006 a having pressure gauge 1007 in the line to measure air flow. The air flow is then split between line 1006 b (for air flowing into container 1003 a) and line 1006 c (for air flowing to container 1003 b). Temperature probe 1009 a is used for container 1003 a, and temperature probe 1009 b is used for container 1003 b. Temperature probe 1009 b is attached to temperature monitor 1008 b. Temperature probe 1009 a is attached to temperature monitor 1008 a. Container 1003 a has opening 1004 a at the top of same. Container 1003 b has opening 1004 b at the opening thereof. The overall apparatus having tandem containers for testing purposes is indicated by reference numeral 1000\u2032., 65018=Blakeway and Sauvage, U.S. Pat. No. 5,369,092 issued on Nov. 29, 1994, discloses novel odorant compositions comprising panthenol with a perfume concentrate and ethanol, whereby the addition of panthenol prolongs the diffusion of perfume materials from the skin. The panthenol, however, is different in kind rather than degree from the polymers used in film forming the fragrance-containing films of our invention and does not give rise to the unexpected, unobvious and advantageous results of the fragrance carrier system of our invention; and further, does not give rise to the fragrance substance evolving from the film into the environment proximate the film by means of molecular diffusion at a permeation rate of from about 1\ufffd10\u22127 up to about 0.1 mg-mm/cm2-minute., 342266=The polymer layer 1016 is formed from a coatable composition applied to the web 1012 and the fabric 1014. The coatable composition includes fragrance contained therein. The coatable composition may comprise liquid reactive components or a thermoplastic polymer material which has been sufficiently fluidized by heat, for example, and hardened to form the polymer layer 1016, as described herein. Preferred are those polymers which will harden in situ, such as by curing, and will remain solid at room temperature. Curing of the composition can be accomplished in a known manner such as by heating in an oven, exposure to ultraviolet light, the use of peroxides and the like. Alternatively, thermoplastic polymers which solidify at room temperature can also be used., 71243=(i) molecules of at least one fragrance substance in an initial weight ratio of fragrance:polymeric gel of from about 0.01:20 up to about 50:0.01; and, 63991=Israel Patent No. 91422 issued on Oct. 31, 1995 (assigned to Dento-Med Industries Inc.) discloses a stable oil-in-water emulsion characterized in that it contains 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate homopolymer from which a non-gummy, hygroscopic, flexible and pliable thin layer which can be deposited on an epidermal surface can be made and which optionally contains a plurality of plasticizers each having a different solvency power for 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate homopolymer thereby controlling the pliability of the layer of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate homopolymer. On page 14 of Israel Patent No. 91422, it is indicated that the thin layer is formed when a cosmetic formulation is deposited on an epidermal surface. Although at pages 21-23 of the Israel patent, a cosmetic formulation of Dento-Med discloses a number of possible ingredients, there is no mention and no implication of the use of fragrances therein such as those fragrances which can diffuse out of the membrane as is claimed in our invention., 341637=The hardened polymer layer 1016 comprises a flexible low friction surface 1017(a) coextensive with the reinforcing fabric and portions 1017(b) which extend through the fabric 1014 and are bonded to fibers of the web 1012. The low friction back surface 1017(a) of the finished article may be planar without protrusions or depressions therein. Alternatively, the surface 1017(a) may be dimpled or otherwise textured to adapt the article to a particular end use. If desired, indicia may be applied to the surface 1017(a)., 344883=In selecting the polymer for the manufacture of the layer 1016, consideration is given to the end use of the finished article, allowing for the required flexibility of the article and its conformability to the surface of the workpiece. An additional consideration in the formation of endless belts is the ability of the polymer to provide a low friction surface capable of withstanding significant heat buildup caused by the application of a stationary platen, for example. An article made without the ability to withstand the heat generated during use will experience a shortened useful life and may present a safety hazard., 178245=as described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,017 issued on Apr. 22, 1997, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein., 176086=(iii) soap, fatty acid-based gelling agents as particularly described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,092 issued on Dec. 17, 1996 (Trandai, et al), the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein, including salts of fatty acids containing 12 to about 40 carbon atoms, preferably salts of C12-C22 fatty acids, more preferably salts of C14-C20 fatty acids and most preferably salts of C16-C20 fatty acids with the salt forming cations for use in these gelling agents including metal salts such as alkalai metals, for example, sodium and potassium and alkaline earth metals, for example, magnesium and aluminum; and in addition, hydrogel-forming polymeric gelling agents as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,663 (Masuda, et al) issued on Feb. 28, 1978, the specification is incorporated by reference herein; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,731,067 (Le-Khac) issued on Mar. 15, 1988, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The suitable hydrogel-forming polymeric gelling agents are specifically discussed at columns 6-12 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,092 (Trandai, et al) issued on Dec. 17, 1996, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety; and, 333439=Following the optional needle tacking step, the non-woven web is impregnated either with a resin-abrasive slurry or a resin binder (e.g., without abrasive particles) depending upon the required aggressiveness of the finished article. The non-woven web is thoroughly saturated with the resin-abrasive slurry or the resin binder using any of a number of conventional application techniques, such as spray coating, dip-coating or roll coating, using a two-roll coater, for example. The preferred resins for use in coating the non-woven web also include the fragrance materials as set forth herein. The preferred resins for use in coating the non-woven web are also those which, upon curing, will be relatively hard and which will provide firm bonding of the constituent fibers to one another. Exemplary of resins that are useful in this aspect of the present invention include but are not limited to phenolic resins, aminoplast resins having pendant \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl groups, urethane resins, epoxy resins, ethylenically unsaturated resins, acrylated isocyanurate resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, isocyanurate resins, acrylated urethane resins, acrylated epoxy resins, bismaleimide resins, fluorine-modified epoxy resins and combinations thereof. Catalyst and/or curing agents may be added to the binder precursor to initiate and/or eliminate polymerization. Preferably, the binders used in this aspect of our invention are phenolic resins, such as resole and novolac resins, described in Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 1981, New York, Volume 17, pages 384-399, incorporated by reference herein. Resole phenolic resins are made from an alkaline catalyst and a molar excess of formaldehyde, typically having a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol between about 1.0:1.0 and 3.0:1.0. Novolac resins are prepared under acid catalysis and with a molar ratio of formldehyde to phenol less than 1.0:1.0. Commercially available phenolic resins suitable for use in this aspect of our invention include those known under the trade designations \u201cDUREZ\ufffd\u201d and VARCUM\ufffd,\u201d available from Occidental Chemicals Corporation (North Tonawanda, N.Y., U.S.A.); \u201cRESINOX\ufffd,\u201d available from Monsanto Corporation; and \u201cAROFENE\ufffd\u201d and \u201cAROTAP\ufffd,\u201d both available from Ashland Chemical Company., 263689=FIG. 5H sets forth the effect of log10P on the permeation rate of the aroma chemicals, ethyl tiglate and \u03b2-pinene, through \u201calginate\u201d (described in detail at monograph number 240 on page 45 of THE MERCK INDEX, Twelfth Edition, published by Merck Research Laboratories Division of Merck & Company, Inc., Whitehouse Station, N.J., 1996, and incorporated by reference herein). \u201cAlginate\u201d is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 2,036,934, incorporated by reference herein., 340531=The polymer layer 1016 encapsulates the woven, stretch-resistant reinforcing fabric 1014. The polymer layer 1016 will also include fragrance material which is controllably releasable therefrom. Preferably, the polymer is applied as a hardenable, coatable composition in the form of a viscous fluid and, typically, in the molten state. With the application of pressure, the coatable composition will extrude through the openings in the reinforcing fabric 1014 and into the non-woven web 1012. In this manner, the molten polymer flows around and encapsulates fibers along the first major side 1012(a) of the web 1012. The polymer is then hardened in a known manner to form a reinforcing, thick, continuous polymer layer 1016, forming an outer surface of the article, which in a controllably releasable manner releases fragrance molecules into the air on use of the device which it is part of. Preferably, the polyer is applied and hardened without significant penetration through the balance of the non-woven web 1012., 65829=PCT Patent Application No. 97/25018 published on Jul. 17, 1997 and assigned to Launceston, Ltd. of St. Peter Port, Guernsey, Channel Islands, discloses a scented nail polish which comprises:, 71413=(ii) water molecules in an initial weight ratio of water:polymeric gel of from about 1:500 up to about 500:1,, 347441=Referring to FIG. 11, a preferred method for the manufacture of articles according to this aspect of our invention is illustrated in schematic form and will now be described in detail. A lay-up 1120, including a non-woven web 1122, is fed from a feed roll 1124. The non-woven web 1122 may be previously needle tacked, coated and hardened as described herein. A reinforcing fabric 1126 is fed from the feed roller 1128 to a pair of counter rotating nip rolls 1130 (laminating roll) and 1132 (casting roll) where the non-woven web 1122 and the fabric 1126 are joined to form a laminate. An extruding apparatus fitted with a film die 1134 is positioned to apply a sheet of a coatable composition 1136 into the nip so that the composition is applied to the outermost surface of the scrim 1126., 339660=Other materials may be used such as those made of polyester, cotton, animal hair, other polyamides and the like. Preferably, at least one layer of woven stretch-resistant reinforcing fabric 1014 is included with the articles 1010 and 1012 of this aspect of our invention. Additional layers of fabric (not shown) may be used in addition to the first woven fabric layer 1014 to provide additional dimensional strength as long as the openings in the woven fabrics are at least partially aligned so as not to substantially impede the extrusion of the polymer through the two fabric layers and into the non-woven layer 1012. Where two or more fabric layers are included, they are preferably positioned adjacent one another in the finished article., 175198=wherein each of the terms set forth in the foregoing mathematical models are set forth in the paper entitled \u201cMathematical Models of Flavor Release from Liquid Emulsions\u201d by Harrison, et al, JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE, July/August 1997, Volume 62, No. 4, at pages 653-664, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. The controlling factors for \u201cflavors\u201d as set forth in the Harrison, et al paper apply equally as well to the fragrances discussed herein., 349441=In this manner, a continuous sheet 1140 of surface finishing material is formed comprising the non-woven web 1122 and the scrim 1126 bonded to one another by a hardened polymer layer. The polymer layer thus-formed comprises a smooth low friction surface coextensive with the reinforcing fabric and portions extending through the fabric forming discrete bonding areas which encapsulate fibers in the non-woven web 1122. A roll 1138 guides the continuous sheet 1140 of surface finishing material to take-up roll 1142 from which the material 1140 may be subsequently be cut to form disks, pads, endless belts and the like., 336797=Abrasive mineral-coated belts satisfactory for use in article finishing typically should have a non-woven surface having a shore A(HA) durometer, according to ASTM test method D2240-86, of about less than 10 to about 85 as measured with a 5 mm diameter \u201cA\u201d instrument foot. Although an HA value lower than 10 is considered to be out of the range of ASTM D2240, readings of about 5 have been measured on the softer articles of this aspect of our invention. A lower durometer measurement typically results in a belt which is easily snagged and torn by sharp corners of the workpieces, for example. Articles of higher durometer measurements are excessively dense and will frequently load up with pieces of abradant. Where the article is to be used in polishing applications, the non-woven web 1012 usually will not include abrasive particles, but may include less abrasive minerals, such as talc, for example., 55275=This application is a Continuation-in-Part of Application for U.S. Patent, Ser. No. 09/150,240 filed on Sep. 10, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,365., 329012=The articles, which are embodiments of the present invention, can also be provided in the form of disks such as disk 1018 shown in FIG. 9. Disk 1018 may include a central opening 1020 to facilitate mounting. Except for its converted external shape, the internal structure of the disk 1018 is identical to that of belt 1010 of FIG. 8 including a non-woven layer 1012, a woven material 1014 and a polymeric material (produced according to Example II, infra) 1016 as described above. Surface finishing articles of our invention also comprise surface finishing pads (not shown) having the above-described feature which may be cut or converted into any of a variety of shapes, e.g., rectangular, square, circular, oval, etc. All such surface finishing articles having the described features will be understood as within the scope of the present invention. Further details of the components of the surface finishing articles of our invention are provided below., 327332=Referring to FIGS. 8, 9, 10 and 11, the surface finishing article according to our invention in the form of an endless belt 1010 (FIG. 8) is shown. A three-dimensional non-woven web 1012 and a woven stretch resistant reinforcing fabric 1014 are components of the belt 1010. The non-woven web 1012 includes an inner first major surface 1012(a) and an outer or second major surface 1012(b) with the second surface 1012(b) being the working surface of the belt 1010 (see FIG. 10). The reinforcing fabric 1014 preferably comprises a woven material having a plurality of openings therethrough (generally indicated at 1015). Fabric 1014 is applied against the first surface 10129 a) of the non-woven layer 1012. The flexible polymer layer 1016 (produced according to the process of Example II, infra) extends and is coextensive with the major surface of the fabric 1014 forming exposed surface 1017(a) and providing a drive surface of belt 1010 which in use would be carried on drive rollers and supported there between on a platen of a surface finishing machine (not shown). Exposed surface 1017(a) is preferably a low friction surface to avoid heat buildup between it and the surface of the platen. Portions 1017(b) (FIG. 10) of the polymer layer 1016 extend through openings in the fabric 1014 to form discrete bonding areas with fibers 1011 along the first major surface 1012(a) of non-woven layer 1012., 188103=In carrying out the aforementioned process, it is helpful in blending the fragrance, film forming polymer and solvent to use a homogenizer and/or a rotor/stator high shear mixer. Examples of a homogenizer useful in the practice of this aspect of our invention are laboratory homogenizer models 15MR and 31MR manufactured by APV Gaulin, Inc. of 44 Garden Street, Everett, Mass. 02149. Examples of rotor/stator high shear mixers are the high shear in-line mixers manufactured by Silverson Machines, Inc., P.O. Box 589, 355 Chestnut Street, East Long Meadow, Mass. 01028 and by the Scott Process Equipment Corporation, P.O. Box 619, Sparta, N.J. 07871. The aforementioned homogenizers and rotor/stator high shear mixers can be used in conjunction with one another, with the rotor/stator high shear mixers being used first, and then in order to complete the blending, the resultant emulsion is further homogenized using the homogenizers such as laboratory homogenizers, models 15MR and 31MR., 350136=It will be understood that the foregoing process can be modified and this aspect of the invention is not to be considered as limited to the specific steps described above. The continuous material 1140 may be fed directly from the nip rolls 1130 and 1132 to a cutting station (not shown) where the sheet 1140 may be cut into finished articles. It is also contemplated that the film die 1134 can be positioned to apply the coatable composition 1136 between the non-woven web 1122 and the scrim 1126. In such an embodiment, the pressure from the nip rolls 1130 and 1132 will be sufficient to force the molten polymer through the side of the fabric 1126 adjacent the non-woven web 1122, first coating the non-woven fibers with the composition 1136 and forcing the composition through the openings in the fabric to form the smooth continuous low friction exposed surface of the article, s discussed, supra. Other modifications to the described process may be made while remaining within the contemplated scope of this aspect of the invention., 337820=The reinforcing fabric 1014 is preferably a woven stretch-resistant fabric with a low-stretch value when pulled in opposing directions. A stretch value of less than about 20% is preferred and a value of less than about 15% is more preferred. Suitable materials for use as the reinforcing fabric in the articles of this aspect of our invention include, without limitation, thermobonded fabrics, knitted fabrics, stitch-bonded fabrics and the like. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that this aspect of our invention is not to be limited to the selection of one reinforcing fabric over another, and it is contempleated that this aspect of our invention will include any type of material which otherwise has the requisite properties as set forth herein., 332514=The non-woven web 1012 may optionally be further reinforced and consolidated by needle tacking, treatment which mechanically strengthens the non-woven web by passing barbed needles therethrough. During this treatment, the needles pull the fibers of the web with them while they pass through the non-woven web so that, after the needle has retrated, individual collections of fibers of the web are oriented in the thickness direction of the non-woven fabric. The amount or degree of needle tacking may include the use of about 8 to about 20 needle penetrations per square cm of web surface when 15\ufffd18\ufffd25\ufffd3.5 RB, F20 6-32-5.5B/3B/2E/L90 needles (commercially available from Foster Needle Company, Manitowoc, Wis., U.S.A.) are used. Needle tacking is readily accomplished by the use of a conventional needle loom which is commercially available from, for example, Dilo, Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., U.S.A., 335790=The first and/or the second surfaces 1012(a) and 1012(b), respectively, of the non-woven web 1012 are coated with the aforementioned resin binder which also includes fragrance material and which also may include optional abrasive particles. Abrasive particles can also be applied in a separate step after the application of the resin binder to the web 1012. Abrasive particles suitable for use herein are preferably of 24 grade or finer, such as those normally used for finishing operations. Suitable abrasive particles include aluminum oxide including ceramic aluminum oxide, heat-treated aluminum oxide and white-fused aluminum oxide; siliconic carbide, alumina zirconia, diamond, ceria, cubic boron nitride, garnet, flint, emery and combinations of the foregoing. Additionally, abrasive agglomerates can be used, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,652,275 and 4,799,939, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.}",

These modifications are to be construed as being encompassed within the scope of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims. 688 Grams of polyvinyl acetate (viscosity of 45 cps at 60\ufffd C. dissolved in benzene) was dissolved in 3,200 ml of methanol, 800 ml of 4.6 n-methanolic hydrochloric acid and 210 grams of the fragrance of Example IV, supra. The reaction produced a water-soluble product in 2.5 hours. 78.4 Grams of cyclohexanone was added to the solution, and the solution was then allowed to stand for 18 hours until an infrared scan showed minimal carbonyl groups. 10% Of the hydroxyl groups were converted to acetal groups. This solution was applied to cotton fabric and tested in the same manner as described in Example VI(A), supra. The resulting cotton fabric provided a water vapor permeable, but water impenetrable coated fabric. The resulting fabric also gave rise to a fragrance headspace-time profile closely similar to that set forth in FIGS. 6A and 6B, described supra. EXAMPLE VI(D) 140 Grams of polyvinyl alcohol was dissolved in a mixture of 715 ml of water, 275 ml of methanol and 30 grams of the fragrance of Example IV, supra. To this was added 11.5 grams of hexadecyl aldehyde and 4 ml of concentrated",
