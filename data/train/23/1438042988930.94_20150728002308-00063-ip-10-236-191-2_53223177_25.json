The Pats signed him as a free agent a day before losing in New York back on September 19., 73942=Both teams drove into field goal range on their opening drives. New England's Shayne Graham had enough leg for a 41-yarder through a bitter wind 4:03 in, while Nick Folk missed wildly on a 53-yard try a little later., 74836=Woodhead took a screen pass on the first play of ensuing series 35 yards to the New York 32. The big gain set up a touchdown from the four, as Brandon Tate got his left knee and wrist inbounds while bringing down a pass along the left sideline with 8:15 remaining in the half., 75125=It stayed 24-3 at the break, and the Jets had a promising march thwarted when Brandon Spikes picked off Sanchez in the red zone early in the third., 75285=New England proceeded to go 93 yards in eight plays, culminated in Wes Welker's 18-yard score. The diminutive receiver caught an out route at the 14 then carried Jets cornerback Drew Coleman into the end zone with 4:40 remaining in the third.}",
