            "campus police are so nice and quick! we have emergency poles all over came where you would press the button if something happened. also, their office is on campus and there is always someone there. umhb is a safe place to be.",
            "we don't have any frats or sororities.",
            "i play on the basketball team, and in division iii sports your team is truly like your family. but there are also a lot of clubs you could join like young life that is really popular! i dont know much about clubs because basketball really takes up a lot of time. i am however about a residence hall association. this club is great because you do different things for the people living on campus and its great to do a service for the other college students.",
            "umhb is great for focused students who want to get the most out of college, if you are a student who is more worried about how much you will get to party then you probably shouldnt come here. if you are a student who is determined and know you want to be successful in life, then come to umhb. also, if you want to get closer to god this is a great place to do it.",
            "my favorite thing about our campus, is the history. all over campus you will find different statues relevant to christ and the school, it really adds to the authenticity of the campus.",
            "umhb is a very expensive school, but i do believe it is somewhat worth the money. it is a small community, and campus, but all this means is everything you may need is right there for you. the faculty understands that money is a problem and really help you the best they can. you definitely get the education you paid for and some of the professors have great connections and will help you find really good jobs.",
            "belton has the weigh station which is a frozen yogurt place and people hang out there alot. but usually people go to temple and killeen to have a good time. there is a lot to do in those towns.",
            "hardy hall is similar to any other cafeteria. there are some things that are really good, and others that are questionable. i personally like hardy and the breakfast is amazing!",
            "the only reason i give dorm like two stars is because of the restrictions, there are only girl and only boy dorms and boys can only be in the dorm on certain visitation days. also there is a room check bi-weekly which isnt that big of a problem because they just want to make sure their furniture is being taken care of, which is understandable. other than that the dorms are great for making new friends and all the residence director are really awesome!",
            "the academic rigor varies with each major, the most difficult major that we have here is nursing. i have a few friends that are nursing majors and have said that it is hard but definitely worth it. i am a computer information systems major and find that my classes are challenging but extremely passable if you apply yourself. the faculty really care about their students success and most professor will help you as much as they can if you ask.",
            "for any school that is considering coming here, make sure you are prepare for strict rules, they are not unbearable but it is a very christian university. also, the more you get involved in different clubs or sports the better the experience you will have. this college truly is what you make it.",
            "the university of mary hardin-baylor is the perfect for a serious student who wants to succeed and become closer to god. the students and faculty here are very nice and truly care about you. it is growing every year and is clearly becoming one of the best division iii schools in texas."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{14762=In the summer, before I began my first semester of college I couldn't imagine being here at UMHB. I didn't believe this was where I was supposed to be. I participated in the University's Welcome Week 2010 for incoming freshman and transfer student. During that first week my entire perspective on the University changed. I learned that here, they want this to be a place we can call home. A place to find brothers, sisters, friends, spouses etc and live together as a community of Crusaders. I'll never forget when I changed my mind about my expectations of my first year at the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor. It was the last event of Welcome Week, the dubbing ceremony. It's an event where all the new students sit out in from of Luther Memorial, light our candles, go on bended knee before our faculty and professors and pledge ourselves Crusaders Forever. To most students it's kinda a funny tradition, it's kinda chaotic there isn't any robes or chanting in the background, but to me it was the day I decided I was going to make the most of what God had given me. Not to long afterward I found friends that I could depend on. What was more I found brothers and sisters in Christ who I trust and rely on. We walk together as Christians and as Crusaders. On campus, there really is a sense of comradery. If you need a ride anywhere there is always a friendly face and a willing friend to give you a ride. I think the biggest form of unity we have at the University is the Home football games. Hundreds of students, alumni, faculty and staff all gather together in their cars, line up, roll down their windows and scream with a police escort all the way to the football field. Then, like crusaders going off to war we cheer for our team. Everywhere you go and to every event the students you see are always happy, always excited to see you, and if anyone is having a bad day or is worried about anything the students here are the first to pray for you, cry with you, laugh with you and help you through anything. I never thought I'd find a home here at UMHB, but that's exactly what I found. I really hope whoever is reading this can find that home here too., 188883=- Be yourself - Be ready with Ramen for the weekends because the cafeteria is closed on Saturday and on Sunday, they only serve lunch. Unless you want to get Chick-fil-A once the new Student Union building opens this coming September. - Tolerate and accept people of different faiths, 282053=Our university just opened a NEW student union this semester! Inside of it is an amazing cafeteria which is loads better than the previous Hardy Hall. They have a wide range of options such as a pizza bar, salad bar, sandwich bar, soups, burgers, stir fry, and some sort of home style choice at each meal! Also some days, there is a taco bar or wing bar, and in the mornings their is an omelet bar and waffle bar. The people who work in the cafeteria take the time to ask about your day and make sure that your dining experience is as best as it can be. Also, the Union has a Starbucks, 1845 Grill and Chick-fil-a inside in which students can use their Dining Dollars to eat at as well., 105660=i'm considering transferring schools because the cost is so high. it's roughly $2000 for a 3 semester hour class. and that's not adding in the various fees that colleges like to throw in. great school, but not if you don't want tons of student debt at graduation., 7826=Don't wait...visit UMHB now! I wanted to enjoy my senior year and not worry about where I was going to go to college so I did my research and visited several colleges and I made my decision in January that UMHB was the place for me., 288045=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 75497=The food when I first attended UMHB was, I'll be honest, TERRIBLE. But very shortly after my first semester there, they installed a feedback system where in the cafeteria there was a box where students could place comments on the food in a box. In just a few months, the food quality greatly increased. The SUB, which is separate has great food. And the new student union building which should be finished in the fall of 2013 will feature a Chick-Fil-A and Starbucks, or so we've been told., 74302=UMHB is an expensive university, however, they accommodate for this by giving lots of financial aid to incoming students. The university also puts the money to good use by constantly improving the facilities students use on campus, like the new stadium and student union building being constructed that will be completed by the fall of 2013, and the new field house for athletes. The campus always looks beautiful due to a dedicated gardening staff., 81173=This year we've started the traditions walk where every class starts at a different location on campus and we all march together to the crusader statue in front of the stadium. We are also starting a new tradition with a dance the student body does at every home football game., 243601=Since 1894, UMHB has been notoriously awesome at creating the coolest events for students. It used to be a female college, but then later integrated and decided to create a new tradition for the holidays called Stunt Night in which a whole class could create a spoof or original story and perform their skits in front of the school. Other fun traditions include Foamcoming- where the school brings out a large machine to generate foam and music - and Spring Formal, which gives students an opportunity to dance the night away like they were Seniors in high school prom again., 178978=Annual pancake supper before finals, play day in april, Easter pageant for the community, stunt night- classes compete in a skit on stage}",

I wanted to enjoy my senior year and not worry about where I was going to go to college so I did my research and visited several colleges and I made my decision in January that UMHB was the place for me. Bang for the buck UMHB is expensive, but my parents say you get what you pay for. I plan to be a nurse and UMHB has one of the best nursing schools anywhere. I don't want to be a number in an auditorium so for the caliber of instruction and the class size, great value! Am enjoying being here I graduated in the top 5% of my High School class and was accepted at many large universities, but I knew from the start UMHB was the right choice for me. The classes are small enough so the professor actually knows your name and your work. The campus facilities are great. I am an athlete and work out all",
