The Cisco SC node is the combination of hardware (Cisco PGW 2200 and Cisco SLTs) and signaling controller software that provides the signaling controller function. The Cisco SC node transports the signaling traffic between the SC hosts and the SS7 signaling network. A brief example of the process of an ISDN message containing an ISUP GTD message that comes into the Cisco OGW from a Cisco SC node is described below and shown in the figure below., 62114=The ISDN UDI to SIP Clear-Channel feature maps the ISDN bearer capability to an appropriate codec on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk. When an ISDN bearer capability message is received as an Unrestricted Digital Information (UDI), only the clear-channel codec is used for negotiation on the SIP trunk. When the ISDN bearer capability message is non-UDI, like speech, the specific voice codecs are used for negotiation on the SIP trunk. The ISDN UDI to SIP Clear-Channel feature is applicable only for clear-channel and voice codecs. Integrated Service Router (ISR) gateways receive calls on ISDN trunks and forward them to SIP IP trunks., 11246=The workaround created in Cisco IOS Release 12.3(2)XB is no longer supported with the release of this feature. The workaround handled the CIC parameter by including it in the called-party number. The To header in the SIP INVITE message that contained the called-party number was prefixed with 101xxxx, where xxxx was the CIC parameter. The number was then sent to the ISDN in the SETUP message. When the ISDN received the number, for example, 101032119193921234 the ISDN ignored the 101 and then routed the call to carrier 0321, as if 0321 was in the TNS IE of the outgoing SETUP message. The rest of the number, formatted as the called-party number, was forwarded to the carrier., 140423=Configure the Cisco PGW2200 to encapsulate SS7 ISUP messages in GTD format before using the signaling forward command with the Cisco PGW 2200 signaling controller on the Cisco gateway., 164094=Enables clear-channel codec to UDI bearer capability mapping and UDI bearer capability to clear-channel codec mapping., 7370=The Cisco PGW 2200 SC is formerly known as the Cisco Media Gateway Controller (MGC) and the Cisco SC 2200 signaling controller.}",
