If you enter a wrong port number, a SIP REFER message request is sent to the IP phone but the Cisco Unified SIP IP phone is not paged., 349610=When a call that uses a G.711 codec is parked, the caller hears the music-on-hold (MOH) audio stream; otherwise, the caller hears the on-hold tone., 61812=If a caller presses 2 for customer service, the call is transferred to 2222 and then is sent to the next available ephone-dn from the group of ephone-dns assigned to ephone hunt group 1: 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. The sequencing of ephone-dns within a hunt group is handled by the ephone hunt group itself, not by the B-ACD service.

Pages to extension 2000 are multicast to ephones 1 and 2.

Finally, when extension 2002 is dialed, a page is sent to ephones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and voice register pools 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (new combined paging group)., 358542=The following example shows a dedicated call-park slot, 2558, that is reserved for the phone that has the primary extension of 2977. Both extension 2977 and 2976 are on the same phone, so they both can use this slot, which is reserved only for the extensions on that phone. After three timeout intervals of 60 seconds, a parked call is recalled to extension 2977.

When extension 2001 is dialed, a page is sent to ephones 3 and 4 (second single paging group). Finally, when extension 2002 is dialed, a page is sent to ephones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, producing the combined paging group (composed of the first single paging group, the second single paging group, and ephone 5)., 448864=RSA key pair size is 1024., 616209=In the following example, extension number 1222 under voice register dn 4 has a higher preference than number 1222 under voice register pool 5., 248687=The following example configures a Basic DID application on the Cisco Unified CME router. It sets a prefix of 5 to apply to the digits coming from the CO in order to construct a valid extension number. Then the secondary prefix (4) is appended. If the incoming DID digits are 25, the DID prefix is 5, and the secondary prefix is 4, then the transformed number is 4525. The transformed number matches VoIP dial peer 1000. The VoIP dial peer sends calls to the primary Cisco Unified CME router using the IP address that is entered in the session target command. The dial peer uses the forward-digits command to send the extension number, 525, to the primary Cisco Unified CME router., 583141=In the following example, the number 1222 under ephone-dn 4 has a higher preference than the number 1222 under ephone-dn 5., 448618=2048 bits, 10888=In the following example, paging sets 20 and 21 are defined and then combined into paging group 22. Paging set 20 has a paging extension of 2000. When someone dials extension 2000 to deliver a page, the page is sent to Cisco IP phones (ephones) 1 and 2. Paging set 21 has a paging extension of 2001. When someone dials extension 2001 to deliver a page, the page is sent to ephones 3 and 4. Paging group 22 combines sets 20 and 21, and when someone dials its paging extension, 2002, the page is sent to all the phones in both sets and to ephone 5, which is directly subscribed to the combined paging group., 521740=The following example shows how to use a secondary pilot number in a parallel hunt group. Local phones can dial the primary pilot number, 1100. External phones (PSTN) must dial the full E.164 number, 4085550100., 448331=1024 bits. This is the default key size., 451678=The following example specifies a key size of 2048 bits., 548242=Port for secure communication. Range is from 2000 to 9999. Default is 3804., 356426=The following example shows a basic call-park slot at extension 1001. After a call is parked at this number, the system provides 10 reminder rings at intervals of 30 seconds to the extension that parked the call. Any phone can retrieve calls parked at this extension.}",

Usage Guidelines To configure a set of phones to receive an audio page, follow these steps: Use the paging command in ephone-dn configuration mode to define a number that people can dial to send a page. The following example defines a paging-dn tag (21) and extension number (34455) to dial to send a page.  ephone-dn 21 paging number 34455 Use the paging-dn command in ephone configuration mode to assign the same paging-dn tag that you defined in Step 1 to all the phones that you want to receive the page.
