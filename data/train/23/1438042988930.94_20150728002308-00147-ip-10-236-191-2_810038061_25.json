If your Enchanting skill level is less than 90, he reluctantly agrees to give a lesson. If your skill level is equal to or higher than 90, he becomes defensive and refuses to train you any further in fear of you becoming better than him. This reaction is a stark contrast to all other skill trainers who, in the same circumstances, simply explain that they don't have the knowledge to train you any further: Enchanting Trainer[edit] Services[edit] Experimental Subject: Help Neloth by being a test subject in his experiment.

I might have a few staffs, if you're interested in that sort of thing.\" Staves Merchant[edit] In addition to providing training, Neloth also serves as a magical goods merchant. Most notably, he sells unenchanted staves, regular enchanted staves, and soul gems. Provided he has given you permission to use his staff enchanter, the unenchanted staves can be enchanted with one or more heart stones. When asked what he has for sale, he replies with one of the following three lines: \"Hmm. I might have a few staffs, if you're interested in that sort of thing.\" \"Mostly staffs. They're my specialty.\" \"I suppose I could dig up a staff or two for you.\" He typically carries 1000 gold on hand for trading, but this can be increased to 2000 with the Master Trader perk.
