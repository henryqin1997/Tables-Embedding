A cross cultural experience is actually an academic requirement for GC students, and it is highly encouraged that students take a semester to study abroad. If you come to GC, you will work with your adviser in your respective major to plan out your four years, classes you should take, when you should take them, stuff like that (VERY handy!), and they will work with you to include a study abroad semester in your four-year plan. The cool thing is, you can still graduate after four regular years, despite going away from GC for a semester! Also, if you're a music major looking into getting a recording contract, GC has the connects to help you get there. Rod Kim, Class of 2005, just put out his debut album last fall (sold at Best Buy, iTunes, Amazon, etc.) and his song Tomorrow She's Mine is featured on Rock Band 2 (I played it, and it was fantastic :)) and}",
