    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Nursing is a very popular major at Roane State. Tips for prospective students Be organized. You're not in high school anymore, professors don't like excuses. If you wait until the last minute on your class work it will show. This goes for every college not just Roane State. Bang for the buck It's a community college so that automatically makes it cheaper than a four year university. However you are getting just as much or even more education than if you did go to a four year school. Am learning a lot Because it is a smaller school you are able to actually talk to the professors if you have a question, and not just be one of over 100 students in one class.
