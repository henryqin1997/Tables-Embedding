Since the Eagles had just one timeout remaining heading into the drive, the Steelers were able to run out the remaining time and set up Suisham with the game-winning kick., 72310=Mendenhall picked up 31 yards on a game-winning drive that lasted the final 6:33 after the Eagles had taken a one-point lead on Brent Celek's two-yard touchdown catch., 73255=Twice on the 17-play, 79-yard march McCoy ran for a first down on 4th-and-1, the first coming from Philadelphia's own 30-yard line. There were also a pair of third-down conversions, including on 3rd-and-goal from the two when Vick found Celek just over the goal line with 6:33 to play.}",
