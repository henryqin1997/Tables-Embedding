            "If you like the city but are a little nervous about being in a huge town. Fresno is the in between. Fresno is mostly centered around Ag, its very important to people here in the central valley, but there is still a lot to do. There's the Clovis rodeo and Big Fresno fair which are always super fun but there's also great shopping and entertainment that you can't get in a small town!",
            "Dorms aren't the best. I suggest living in Palazzo, it's very safe and right next to campus. Take GE classes first, Drama 62, Communications 8, are the way to go. Get your GPA up and keep it there. Use your credit/no credit option for later in your career for the super hard classes.",
            "Unfortunately tuition has gone up a lot :( It's hard to say it's worth it when I'm already in debt at the age of 18 but it is a great school",
            "It's right down the street from great shopping! There's always a lot to do you can go to the zoo, shop, lots of places to eat, and a water park! On campus there is a bowling ally, billards, and an arcade. We have a Subway, Panda Express, Chick-Fil-A, and Taco Bell. There's a brand new gym that's very nice, the gym offers many group excersise classes (Zumba is my favorite) and they change each semester.",
            "I love all of my classes and the professors are great! They are willing to help you with any problem you may have. It's nice to know they are really there for you, remember, that's their job! Even the GE classes are great, I really am learning a lot more than I expected."

We have a great athletics department, namely our men's baseball team which won the NCAA Tournament in 2008. We also have a fantastic and top-notch music department., 68405=You get out of your education what you put in. I have learned a great deal since I started attending CSU Fresno as a first time freshman in 2009. There is free tutoring in the learning center located on the bottom floor of the library and professors also offer plenty of assistance to struggling students. The textbooks are informative and can usually be rented at an affordable price in the library. Overall, CSU Fresno offers a great learning environment. I'm definitely learning a lot., 200927=The dining hall was awesome at first! I was excited about the all you can eat aspect. The breakfast omelets were to die for, and Thursday pizza was exceptional. However, they started making meals that NO ONE wanted. They would repeat a lot of things and it got old fast. I stopped wanting to go around February. Some days were better than others., 551047=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 88318=As CSU tuition rises, State Universities such as Fresno State become more expensive. as of 2011,the prices for next fall including tuition,housing, books and other costs are estimated at 22,000 total. However, as prices for schooling goes, its a great bargain and a great investment. If you like Fresno and places like it, then this will be a good investment for you., 134469=Tuition has gone up SO much since I started there in 2009, there are hardly any classes to choose from., 405518=There the rock music play at the food court and some kind of festival in April.}",
