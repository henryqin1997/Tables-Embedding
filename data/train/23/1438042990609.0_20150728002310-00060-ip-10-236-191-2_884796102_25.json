However, Mustain offered another theory why so many freshman quarterbacks are playing this season. All freshman quarterbacks do. But because of seven-on-seven drills, imaginative high school offenses and the opportunity to join the team in the summer, they're learning faster and playing sooner. \"I think it's helped in the fact that I had a pretty good understanding of the offense when I came in,\" Mustain said. \"I knew what to expect, but I still have a lot to learn.\" Mustain also has an advantage no other freshman has. Offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn was Mustain's high school coach. \"It's big for us to have Darren and Felix and Michael,\" Mustain said. \"They do a great job. When you're able to give the ball to them and they get yards for you, it takes pressure off the quarterback.\" Arkansas averages 6 yards per rush, which means the Razorbacks don't face many third-and-long situations. They are converting 41.6 percent on third down and have faced third down just 77 times, the sixth fewest in Division I. Mustain, who said he has performed below his expectations, acknowledged that his progress has been aided by luxury of having explosive running backs Darren McFadden, Felix Jones and Michael Smith in",
