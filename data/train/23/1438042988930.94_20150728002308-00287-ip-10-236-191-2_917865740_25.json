Effective March 25, 2015. 47 CFR Parts 1 and 64 Summary In this document, the Commission grants a request to exempt package delivery notifications from the Telephone Consumer Protection Act's (TCPA) restrictions on autodialed and prerecorded calls and messages to wireless telephone numbers, as long as consumers are not charged and may easily opt out of future messages if they wish, among other pro-consumer conditions. Congress gave the Commission the authority to exclude from this prohibition calls and texts that are not charged to the called party, subject to conditions necessary to protect the called party's privacy rights. This action is necessary to allow wireless consumers to receive package delivery notifications that will be welcome both as a convenience and as a way to guard against package theft. 2015-03-03; vol. 80 # 41 - Tuesday, March 3, 2015 80 FR 11326 - Reform of Rules and Policies on Foreign Carrier Entry Into the U.S. Telecommunications Market GPO FDSys XML |",
