            "Everyone should live in the freshman dorms during freshman year to meet new people. However, eaton and pearson, the sophmore dorms, and run down and not that nice.",
            "Students take class work very seriously and the work load is pretty heavy.",
            "-Get involved in all activities that intrest you. You meet so many new people threw this -Think about rushing for a sorority or fraternity, it is a great experience. -Don't get beind in your school work. You will regret having a low GPA freshman year",
            "The university of miami has a beautiful campus and a wide variety of people and races. It is heavily focused on partying and drinking, but most students are very well rounded and take academics and other activities very seriously. It is quite a different experience living in Miami, and you can't beat the weather."

My suggestion is go and visit the campus if you have the opportunity and sit in the classrooms so you can observe how the things are before you sign up. Also, study hard and maintain a high GPA and SAT scores it could make a difference as to how much money you earn. If I would have gotten a higher SAT score I could have been awarded $600. It may seem like a little but if you multiple it by four years that $2400 that I am going to have to pay that I didn't have to if I had done better., 733994=There seems to be many different majors so there is a little something for everyone. I would like to go into medicine to become a surgeon and I have heard from several people that they have an excellent medical program and also they will soon be opening the Miller School of Medicine in 2016., 113058=Beautiful campus, in regards to landscape anyway(because the buildings are not always architectual beauties). While all my friends up north are complaining about snow and freezing to death, I'm chilling in shorts and a tank top in December. Who can beat that? As far as school spirit? It runs rampant. 'Canes go all out when it comes to supporting the U, and I'm not talking just about football games! There's a HUGE choice of clubs and organizations to become a part of and plenty events on or nearby campus to give anyone an active social life. (it IS miami afterall), 529224=It's great because you live on a pretty large campus, yet still have the feeling of community. Although be ready to party after your work is done, because it didn't get Playboy's Party School of 2009 for nothing!, 596238=I'm not going to lie, the dorms could probably use an upgrade, especially Eaton. This being said, the dorm culture is awesome, particularly in the Freshmen dorms. In February, all the dorms have a competition called Sportsfest, and it's a total blast!, 445057=Campus safety is of the essence. After 10:00 p.m., students need to show ID to re-enter residential colleges/dorms. There is also a 24-hour university police force. If a student feels uncomfortable, there is also an escort service available., 106312=-Be prepared for heat and humidity. Although I prefer warm weather, Miami's summer months are disgusting and the rain in the fall just adds to the humidity. However, the winter and spring are wonderful and you will find yourself wearing shorts in the middle of January. - Get a job. Although most things at UM are free to students (all fees are covered in your tuition), the city of Miami is not. If you have a car, be prepared to pay for parking everywhere you go. If you eat out, try to avoid expensive places around South Beach. If you are a guy, be prepared to pay cover charge at the clubs (ladies are lucky because they are free most of the time). However, the price is worth the fun in the end. - Learn a little bit of Spanish. Its Miami - aka Latin America. EVERYONE speaks Spanish. You will get by just fine if you don't speak Spanish but many places to dance and eat have Spanish speaking only staff so it may help if you learn where is the bathroom or may i have the check please in Spanish. I loved this aspect of Miami because I felt like I was studying abroad in a different country, while still being in the US., 1277=You really should apply here because even if it wasn't your first choice initially, you may get a financial aid offer that changes your mind. That's what happened to me and I couldn't be happier. When you try to think of the perfect well-rounded school, the University of Miami really is what comes to mind. Um is increasingly becoming an academic powerhouse, not just an athletic one. Oh, and be sure to visit campus, you will fall in love! Don't let Playboy's title of Best Party School of 2009 fool you, we party hard AND study hard! ;-), 76618=The University has so much to offer in terms of student activities it almost depresses me, because I know it's not physically possible to be a part of every one!! If you've got an interest in some particular field or activity, there's a club somewhere with a spot waiting for you! That's what makes the University so enjoyable! Another plus: the general atmosphere. UM is in Miami which means lots of sun! You can feel that summer energy in the air, an especially unique sensation in November when most Universities are experiencing snow days! There are so many spots around UM to relax, study, and simply enjoy the scenery. Students are busy, but one look up at the blue sky and bright sun brings a feeling of peace and relaxation to any day., 763933=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 17870=TURN IN YOUR FAFSA BEFORE THE PRIORITY DATE!!! I believe the priority date is February 1st. If submitted after that it is unlikely that you will receive any financial aid! Bring a raincoat and umbrella! i forgot to do this at the beginning of the year and ended up getting soaked! Rain boots would be nice too. Choose your roommate online. The university allows you to pick your roommate before you come. There are great sites for picking your roommate online (i used uroomsurf.com) Almost everyone on my floor picked their roommates and everyone is very happy with their choice! If your an incoming freshman, pick Hecht! The university also allows you to choose a preference of residential college, and while you may not get you choice i definitely recommend choosing Hecht. Hecht has better amenities (such as elevators that work on a regular basis) and a great view of the lake. Both dorms are great, Hecht is just a little bit more up to date. If you're upperclassmen and looking for a place to live, i suggest looking for apartments outside the school. If you can get into the UV (university village) thats great, but if not living on campus is rather expensive and it might be more economical to live off-campus. Don't think that your going to be able to party all the time. Yes we like to have a good time but we are still a very academic school. And don't be stupid enough to get caught with alcohol in your room. Join clubs and organizations! Maybe you want to stay active and join an inter mural sports, or pick up a new hobby like scuba diving. The possibilities are endless! ( we even have a muggle quidich team!), 414505=Although Greek life is just under 20% on the university's population, it is rapidly increasing from a mere 13% just a few years ago. A new sorority is coming to campus in 2014 and the expansion for the fraternities is coming even sooner. It is a great way to make a moderately large city/campus seem a little smaller. It helped me to meet a great group of people who I could rely on when I barely knew anyone just weeks before joining. Inter-sorority and inter-fraternity relationships are extraordinary at my school, eliminating the hostility that other campuses might experience between Greeks. It was the best decision I have ever made., 118922=The University of Miami has such an amazing atmosphere. The campus is gorgeous and there is so much greenery and natural beauty. When the cold fronts start coming in late November the temperature is just perfect and it's a great time to sit at the tables outside or lay out on the green and study. There is always something going on around campus, whether it's a Ludacris concert, guest speakers like Condoleezza Rice, or UM Alumni coming to share their success stories and give current students inspiration and suggestions. Being here is a truly enriching experience. There are so many ways to get involved, expand your network, and have fun. The night life isn't necessarily what people from other parts of the country expect. People hear so much about Miami nightlife and expect on campus life here to be a constant party- but if you are a male under 21 years of age you\u2019re pretty limited, don\u2019t expect to go party at South Beach every night. Overall, this is a great place to be, with so many beautiful places to discover and so many cultural activities to experience.}",

You are a nerd You want to learn about different cultures You like to learn you like to party you hate the cold you like to tan Truthfully, UM is for any type of student as long as you put effort into your craft. Tips for prospective students UM is not Harvard or MIT but it is a very competitive academically. The student body and staff hold themselves to very high standards. So first and foremost, you need to be about academics if you want to come to my school. Not only that but a robust student. Extracurricular activities are very important. Bang for the buck UM is a private school so it can get expensive. So I can understand if some people are turned off by the price but I have a pretty good financial aid package",
