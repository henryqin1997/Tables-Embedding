By default, when accessed anonymously, any details about the server\u2019s health are hidden and the endpoint will simply indicate whether or not the server is up or down. Furthermore, when accessed anonymously, the response is cached for a configurable period to prevent the endpoint being used in a denial of service attack.

Tip By default, Spring Boot 1.2.5.RELEASE requires Java 7 and Spring Framework 4.1.5 or above. You can use Spring Boot with Java 6 with some additional configuration. See Section\u00a073.9, \u201cHow to use Java 6\u201d for more details. Explicit build support is provided for Maven (3.2+) and Gradle (1.12+). 9.\u00a0System Requirements Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration. Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration). Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults. Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for all Spring development.

Regardless, you will need Java SDK v1.6 or higher. You should check your current Java installation before you begin: $ java -version If you are new to Java development, or if you just want to experiment with Spring Boot you might want to try the Spring Boot CLI first, otherwise, read on for \u201cclassic\u201d installation instructions. Tip Although Spring Boot is compatible with Java 1.6, if possible, you should consider using the latest version of Java. 10.1\u00a0Installation instructions for the Java developer You can use Spring Boot in the same way as any standard Java library. Simply include the appropriate spring-boot-*.jar files on your classpath. Spring Boot does not require any special tools integration, so you can use any IDE or text editor; and there is nothing special about a Spring Boot application, so you can run and debug as you would any other Java program.
