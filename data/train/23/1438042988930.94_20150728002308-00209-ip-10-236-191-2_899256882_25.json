            "Haven't really seen much going on, but they did recently install security cameras because of a recent bike burglary...so if you do come here, be careful where you leave your bikes and other belongings. Pretty much, it's your responsibility.",
            "I don't believe there are any fraternities here but I do think other four-years that do recruit here...so yeah...that's about all I know.",
            "Clubs?! Man, I feel like there are so many that they never end. (Infinite clubs? I think so...). But if you are into the feminist movement, this school does have a club for that as well as any other interests that you might be into. The engineering club is currently creating a pumpkin launcher. (Sick as heck.)",
            "If you are a student who is paying for school yourself and didn't qualify for financial aid, any of the schools like this one is recommended. Currently tuition is $46 per unit which is a lot cheaper than a four-year.",
            "There is a building (I forget which one...I wanna say it's the Art Gallery) where if you walk into it at night and you can't really see that well (I can't...need glasses) if you look up onto the balcony you'll see two statues standing there staring at you. If you're like me and have a hard time seeing you'll probably be creeped out because one of the statues looks like Michael Meyers...just saying. He creeped me out the first time I saw him.",
            "Overall, I love the school. The classes are great, I love the fact that so far the professors seem like they are willing to push you and guide you through your education career and the overall campus is great because it's not too big and it's not too small that it just feels like you're not even on a college campus.",
            "The SPOT has a lot to offer: pool tables, video games, a microwave (POP Tart it up ya'll), music, and just a cool spot to kick it. If you like playing with trading cards (Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon, Magic, etc.) a lot of students play at The SPOT but they also gather outside of the library if you like that kind of stuff. (I do).My personal favorite spot is the Starbucks across the street, but that's just me.",
            "The food is excellent here. They offer a different type of healthy food that I personally was not acquainted with. I have a vegan friend that attends SAC as well and the dining hall offers food that would fit her food preferences - yes, even Vegans can eat here.",
            "There aren't any dorms or on-campus housings offered because it is a two-year, but the apartments around are available for rent. Some students that I've talked to have gone the rent-a-room route for a lower cost than an apartment for one person. Consider that if you don't live around the area.",
            "I love the rigor. Currently, I am only taking two classes, so it frees me up for work as well as extracurricular activities; however, these two classes have a lot involved in them (consider how a lot can be relative to your level of effort and how much you consider to be a lot). The load is not burdensome unless you as a college student allow that to happen.",
            "My tips for anyone planning on a Community College to go to or even those looking to go into a four-year, consider the Community College route first. It helps save on money because essentially (if you're planning on transferring to a four-year) the classes that you have to take at those higher expense four-years are worth somewhat the same credit as the lower expense two-years; so I suggest considering the lower payments at a community college rather than forking up loads of cash at a four-year. Santa Ana is an excellent school, but I would suggest (in general) to get as much as you can from the school as possible that would help you down the road in your career. There are lots of resources available for you at Santa Ana college, as around and the college life should run a little smoother for you.",
            "Santa Ana College is overall a pretty good school. I have three different schools under my belt so I have a few places to compare it to. One thing I noticed that I figured was great about the school was the community aspect involved with it. You get a sense that there are many opportunities for you as a college student to impact the community around you as well as be cultured by the different cultures brought to the school through clubs as well as the different types of classes offered. It's a great school overall."

    "textAfterTable": "Will enjoy being here Probably, although it is bigger than the school I am at and the parking is sometimes a little crazy. Will learn a lot I hope so since it has classes I need for my major. This school does have a lot of specialized classes for different majors, which helps with the transfer requirements for most 4-year schools.
