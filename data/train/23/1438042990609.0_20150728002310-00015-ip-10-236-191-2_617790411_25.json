            "The LiDAR data were collected in April 2000 for Cayuga County Department of Planning and Economic Development by EagleScan/3Di LLC For the City of Auburn and adjacent areas, the data was acquired at an altitude of 1000m (3000 ft) Above Ground Level (AGL). For the remaining area of the county, the altitude was 2000m (6000 ft) AGL.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received the files in ESRI shapefile format. The data were in New York State Plane coordinates, Central Zone, NAD 83, NAVD88 vertical datum and the vertical units of measure were feet. CSC performed the following processing to the data to make it available within Digital Coast: 1. The data were converted from ESRI Shapefile format to las format using LASEdit. 2. The data were converted from New York State Plane Central coordinates to geographic coordinates. 3. The data were converted from NAVD88 (orthometric) heights to GRS80 (ellipsoid) heights using Geoid99. 4. The vertical unit of measure for the data was converted from feet to meters. 5. The LAS data were sorted by latitude and the headers were updated. 6. The data were filtered to remove outliers."
