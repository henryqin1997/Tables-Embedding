We played well only when we were five against four. I didn't like all the other aspects of our game. We didn't play well in defence and conceded three goals after set pieces. We have also had problems with creating attacks. There were moments when I just wanted to sit down and close my eyes, but coaches can't do that. They have to see all the match from beginning to end., 85292=Edu, Azerbaijan winning goalscorer It was a very hard match. Slovenia proved once more that they have great team. Yes, I cried after the whistle. All our team cried because we are one family\u00a0\u2013 Azerbaijani, Brazilians, all of us. It was a very emotional moment., 72683=1 February 2014, 65886=30 January 2014, 88364=\u00a9UEFA.com 1998-2015.

The fans are already used to this. We had a similar match at the last finals when we played against Serbia, but we lost 9-8 then. Today we were luckier and we won. You feel nervous in each EURO match, especially if it is your first match in the tournament. We scored the first goal fast, but just after that we conceded., 62558=29 January 2014, 87534=Andrej Dobovi\u010dnik, Slovenia coach We were very close to victory, but you can see we only have a small number of players we rely on. Azerbaijan's players largely come from the one club; they are all professionals, they all train twice a day and, of course, they know how to play with the flying goalkeeper. We are sorry that we wasted a very good opportunity to qualify as group winners, but that is sport so we are waiting for the result of the final match between Italy and Azerbaijan.}",
