These reports should be transmitted directly to the circuit using INMARSAT. Alternatively, the observation should be passed to the nearest Canadian Coast Guard MCTS centre, irrespective of the ship's position. Reports made close to, or even within sight of land, are as important as reports made offshore, due to the greater variability of weather conditions in proximity to a coastline. Such reports contribute to the overall knowledge of Arctic weather from both a real-time operational perspective and from a climate perspective., 55242=The Hudson Bay buoy is deployed annually mid to late July and retrieved late September or early October.

Additionally, a wave analysis and forecasting program provides analysis and forecast wave charts of the North Atlantic Ocean for the Department of National defence, Maritime Forces Atlantic. These charts are subsequently re-broadcast to the fleet on Radiofax. The regular program This consists of a full 24 hours, 7 days a week weather watch, warning and amendment service, including a detailed forecast for Halifax Harbour. The regular marine forecast covers the period out to midnight of the following day (days 1 and 2). An extended marine wind outlook covering the next 3 days (days 3, 4, and 5) is also produced. Wave height forecasts are produced twice a day and cover the period out to midnight of the following day.
