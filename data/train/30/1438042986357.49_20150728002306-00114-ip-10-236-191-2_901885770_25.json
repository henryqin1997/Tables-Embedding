    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck College is never cheap, but costs are very reasonable (compare to UW-Madison) for the quality of education and the college experience you will receive. Lots of financial aid is available if you take the time to apply for it. Am enjoying being here Campus is BEAUTIFUL, especially in fall and spring. Freshmen have a great view of the Chippewa River from the dorms! Weekends are very eventful and parties are plentiful. Great place for active people... lots of hiking/biking trails, workout facilities, floating down the river, etc... Am learning a lot For a smaller university, UWEC offers a really wide range of classes. You can study anatomy, geology, and modern dance all in one day if you want. Professors are very passionate and really go out of their way to make sure students understand material. You will write a lot of papers (EC is known for it) but the practice and feedback is very beneficial. Nursing program is extremely competitive... beware if you're considering that as your major.
