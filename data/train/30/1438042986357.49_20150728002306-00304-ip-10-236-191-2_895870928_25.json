            "I dorm on campus and I've never had a problem or any safety issue. There are always cops around and even the fire department is always around. There's also an EMT car always on campus on case something happens.",
            "Montclair is an open campus for greek life. It has different sororities and fraternities and they are among the most important and largest organizations on campus. They make different events that are open for the whole student community. Don't be afraid to ask around if you are interested on joining a greek org, it is a life changing experience.",
            "There's a vast list of clubs and activities at montclair (look on their website). There are cultural organizations, sport organizations, gamers, religious, academics and many others. You should at least become member of one organization and be active! College is not just about going to class, you would be surprise of all the things you can experience and learn outside the classroom and that is in the organizations.",
            "The university offers different events and most of them are free or for a low price. The theater has many plays and shows during the semester, the recreational center has its own evens, and so does the student center and every organization on campus. There's a gym that includes a pool, a basketball court, tennis area and many other things. There's also free cooking classes, or dancing class; just got to make sure you read your emails!",
            "Montclair has a couple of dining services, some are more expensive than others, but there's a vast selection of things to choose from. There's burgers, pizza, pastas, tacos, breakfast, stakes, chinese, japanese and many others. There's a diner on campus that opens 24/7 and is a good choice when you are hungry at night.",
            "Dorm life is excellent!! There are different types of dorms, each one with its own characteristics and rules. From dorms that only includes rooms, or rooms and bathrooms to complete apartments. Each dorm provides events throught the year that are free for students. Also make sure you know your CA which is the student in charge of your dorm. He/she is the person you want to talk to in case you have any concerns or problems with your dorm or even your roommates. The university also offers a program to make dormlife easier, wich includes counceling and helps with roommates issues.",
            "I would say the professor and classes are hard and challenging, but not impossible. College after is about thinkin, developing new skills and discovering our own potential. So don't be scared with a difficult class, work hard and do your best, but also look for help around campus, like tutorials or just asking your professor. Im sure they'll be willing to help.",
            "Visit the campus before applying. Make sure they offer what you are looking for, walk around campus, look for they services they have and if you are looking for a dorm you should visit them too. Take with you a list of your main priorities and concerns and feel free to ask around campus and visit main offices like admissions, financial aid and students account. Have an agenda with deadlines and important dates to remember and remeber to apply on time. And please, dont be shy to look for organizations. Like I said there's something for everyone! Whether is academics, sports, religions, greek life or hobbies, there's is probably an organization or club on campus. Oh and don't miss the free events the university offers! Throught the year they send emails with many events and activities that are free for students or at a really low cost. Just remeber to balance school with fun!",
            "Montclair State University is more than just a good college, is a great community. This university has something for everyone: a vast selections of major, minors and certificates plus many organizations, clubs, activities and programs than every student can enjoy. This was my first semester at Montclair as a transfer student, and I have to say that this is where I belong."

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Well you would have probably heard a lot of things about Montclair( many terrible things) but I want to tell you otherwise MSU is one of the greatest public schools in the state and country at large. It is very affordable, environment is very conducive, students are active friendly and intelligent, staff are resourceful and helpful even though there maybe some exceptions, food is OK, plenty activities to do a lot of clubs and organizations, financial aid and scholarships are available, on campus jobs are available and they even bend it around your schedule, there is also a train station on campus that takes you to NY. People MSU is really a great school I believe you should come and see for yourself. Just get good grades in High school, get involved in as many extra curricula activities as you can and also apply early. Bang for the buck Affordable!!! I believe that what we are paying for we are even getting more the type of education being received at MSU I can say is quite similar to the ivies...the only difference is that it is cheaper!!! Am enjoying being here O yeah before I came to this school I didn't like it because of all that I heard but later on",
