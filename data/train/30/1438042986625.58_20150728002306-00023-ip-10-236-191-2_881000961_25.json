This is a bit of a suitcase campus, meaning that lots of students leave campus on the weekends, so activities on campus can be hard to find. However, this began changing in 2012, with residence life, RHA, SKAT, and other groups making an effort to plan fun activities for the weekend. There are several theme floors, including Gryffindor Tower, the Health and Wellness Floor, and ASL community, and the Honors floor. Dorms are all female with a curfew for having men on campus., 279710=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 134103=Hmmm, well, I'll let you hear about some of our more prominent, defining stories on your tour (ahem) but I *will* share a couple of lesser-known facts about St. Kate's. For one, St. Kate's is an unofficial squirrel sanctuary, and there is a family of albino squirrels on campus that are the secret love affair of many a closet naturist. (Ask any Katie about the albino squirrels. You'll see what I mean.) As for locations, right on the edge of campus is Carondolet village, where many of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet, who founded St. Kate's in 1905, still live. Well, not the Sisters from 1905. But women of the same order, anyway.}",

    "textAfterTable": "People are often scared away by the price of St Kates, as it is a private school, but I really feel like it will help me in the long run. The professors are very open to helping you inside and outside of class and making sure you understand the materials. Campus security does a fabulous job of making you feel safe by patroling and financial aid does a great job of helping you find a way to pay for school. Am enjoying being here St. Kates is a very student involved campus. There are many fun events planned during the year including movies and musical performances. The end of the year culminates with a celebration called Dew Drop Bop which includes games, music, food and a ton of fun! There is also a wide variety of student groups to participate in. Am learning a lot The things I learn in class, I can connect to my outside life. I took a history class last year and to help me study for the final, I watched Pearl Harbor at home and made connections! It was a fun way to help me study! Believe it or not, I also make chemistry connections to things in my everyday life!",
