Also on the horizon is Scott Baker, who hasn't thrown a major league pitch in over a year after undergoing Tommy John surgery, though he won't make his Cubs debut until late August., 198478=Top prospect Archie Bradley won't figure into the mix until rosters expand in September., 184328=Cincinnati's rotation has been one of the best in baseball this season\u2014a pretty remarkable feat considering that the team's best starter, Johnny Cueto, has made three stops on the disabled list and been out of action since the end of June with tightness in his right lat., 163873=Beachy was one of the best pitchers in baseball last season before injuring his elbow in June and undergoing Tommy John surgery. With the quality of the Braves' rotation, the team doesn't need Beachy to rejoin the rotation right away., 108515=If there's a weak link in the group it's veteran Jason Hammel, who has allowed at least four earned runs in 10 of his 19 starts and struggled to keep the ball in the park. Since May 5, Hammel has pitched to a 5.92 ERA and 1.53 WHIP, allowing the opposition to post an OPS of .850., 191374=Seeing as how the Pirates are going to be cautious with Gerrit Cole, \u00a0it wouldn't be at all surprising to see him shifted to the bullpen to limit his innings once Rodriguez is ready to return to action sometime in August., 170992=The potential late-August return of Jonathon Niese, out since mid-June with a partially torn rotator cuff in his left shoulder, is a big deal, not only because a healthy Niese is a very good pitcher, but with both Matt Harvey and Zack Wheeler working under strict innings limits, Niese is needed to pick up some of the slack., 205032=Both Stephen Fife (shoulder) and Ted Lilly (neck) will return to the fold at some point in August, giving the Dodgers options at the No. 5 spot in the rotation should Chris Capuano continue to deliver mediocre outings.\u00a0, 112996=If the prognosis is that Buchholz needs season-ending surgery\u2014which at this point would likely cost him part of next season as well\u2014the Red Sox would still have Peavy in the mix, as the veteran is signed through the 2014 season with a $15 million team option in 2015., 156070=The deal gives the Mariners roughly two months to see if Hughes is a long-term fit for Seattle, and it allows them to continue to take things slow and steady with top prospect Taijuan Walker, who almost assuredly will be called up when rosters expand in September., 104217=*Players who are currently injured and are not expected back until sometime in August were not included in their teams' respective rotation, though some are mentioned., 198212=Brandon McCarthy, on the disabled list since the end of May with a shoulder injury, rejoins the rotation right around the trade deadline, while Trevor Cahill, out since the beginning of July with a hip injury, returns to action shortly thereafter., 170667=Trading Jeremy Hefner is something that the Mets consider, but realizing that he's not going to bring back enough of a significant value in a trade, Sandy Alderson opts to keep the 27-year-old, who is under team control through 2018 and could occupy a back-of-the-rotation role for years at a minimal cost., 194803=So the Cardinals roll along with the same rotation that has gotten them this far, hoping that Chris Carpenter can return to the fold at some point in August and help the team at the back end of the rotation., 131483=Despite having a shaky rotation that could very well undermine the team's hopes of returning to the playoffs for the first time since 2007,\u00a0Cleveland isn't going to move one of its top prospects for a rental., 103090=The countdown to MLB's non-waiver trade deadline has reached single digits, and with that, general managers around the league are scrambling to make moves that put their teams in a better position to contend, if not in 2013, then in 2014 and beyond., 164126=The best move for Atlanta\u2014and Beachy\u2014would be to use him out of the bullpen for the rest of the 2013 season. If you remember, Kris Medlen was used as a reliever during the first half of 2012 as he worked back into form after the same procedure., 141887=Plenty of teams call on Kevin Correia, but the Twins don't hear a package they like and keep the veteran, who is signed for 2014 at a very budget-friendly $5.5 million., 155290=Seattle's front office and coaching staff are feeling the pressure this season, as changes could be coming if the team doesn't show some progress after seeing its win total increase each of the past three seasons, with 75 in 2012., 125028=Brandon Morrow, who has been out since the end of May with tightness in his forearm, is expected back sometime after the trade deadline and could provide some immediate relief to a disappointing group., 145287=Jarred Cosart and Brad Peacock return from the minor leagues to finish out the season for the Astros, picking up valuable experience that will help them as full-time members of the major league rotation in 2014., 160519=The Rangers acquired Cubs' starting pitcher Matt Garza on Monday, July 22., 184618=While Tony Cingrani has done a great job filling in for the team's injured ace, getting a healthy Cueto back at some point in August will be as big a move as the Reds could make to bolster the group., 159929=That said, Garza is solid and has been part of American League pennant races before, having spent 2008 through 2010 with Tampa Bay.\u00a0That experience makes him a great fit behind Yu Darvish and Derek Holland, giving skipper Ron Washington a third reliable starter to lean on., 191141=There's no reason for the team to even look at making any changes to the group, which has reinforcements coming at some point in August with the eventual returns of RHP James McDonald and LHP Wandy Rodriguez.\u00a0, 208574=It's all about 2014 for San Diego, when the rotation figures to include current members Eric Stults and Andrew Cashner, along with three injured arms: Casey Kelly, Cory Luebke and Joe Wieland., 160226=The rest of the rotation remains in flux with multiple players, including rookie Martin Perez, the seemingly always-injured Alexi Ogando and Colby Lewis, who is currently working his way back from elbow surgery last July., 116355=Pineda, who was absolutely dominant in the first half of the 2011 season, earning a spot on the AL All-Star team before fading down the stretch, could provide the jolt of life that the Yankees' rotation needs., 121159=Moving Colome doesn't change that depth, as Tampa Bay has five capable starters in the rotation already, with Alex Cobb (concussion) potentially returning in early August to reinforce the unit., 236255=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Bleacher Report, Inc.

But make no mistake about it, some well-known pitchers will be wearing a different uniform by the time August 1 rolls around. Yet there are only a limited number of established starters available on the market, each one coming with a significant cost\u2014both in terms of money and the prospects it would take to acquire them\u2014that quickly eliminates many would-be suitors from the equation. While it's become cliche to",
    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 Overview While many Orioles fans hoped that the team's acquisition of Scott Feldman from the Cubs earlier this month would be followed up by another move at the deadline, that's simply not going to happen. There's no room left in the team's budget to add anymore salary, according to CBS Sports' Jon Heyman, so this is the rotation that the Orioles will count on to keep them in games\u2014and the playoff picture\u2014down the stretch. The recently acquired\u00a0Feldman has looked good in two of his three starts, and if he's able to give the Orioles a performance along the lines of what the team got from Joe Saunders last season\u2014a 3.63 ERA and 1.28 WHIP\u2014it should be more than enough to help the team win some games. If there's a weak link in the group it's veteran Jason Hammel, who has allowed at least four earned runs in 10 of his 19 starts and struggled to keep the ball in the park. Since May 5, Hammel has pitched to a 5.92 ERA and 1.53 WHIP, allowing the opposition to post an OPS of .850. \u00ab Prev 3 of 32 Next \u00bb Boston Red Sox",
