About three times a week, any of the girls in the dorm that are wanting to eat when group dinner is called, decide where to go to eat as a group, and then walk there together, and talk as they dine at their restaurant of choice. Usually, the RA's have planned an activity at least three times a week. Whether it is decorating Christmas cookies, watching a movie, or eating takeout Thai food dinner to see how it is. The RA's are wonderful and very helpful. It takes a wonderful person to help you with your overflowing toilet at 1:00 in the morning, on finals week., 153351=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

The professors here are great. I even am friends with them Am learning a lot I'm a nursing student and I love having the small classes.
