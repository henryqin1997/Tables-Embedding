To address the question of how \"general is the general model,\" I use alternative general models that differ solely in their lag lengths: 4, 6, and 8 quarters. For each specification, I test for congruency (residuals exhibiting normality, serial independence, and homoskedasticity). To explore the role of estimation methods, I use ordinary least squares (OLS), instrumental variables (IV), and Johansen's, 39404=Goldstein, M. and M.

Figure 2 shows that these conditions are met for U.S. trade in services. For example, the relative price for imports of other private services declines steadily whereas the relative prices for imports of fares rises steadily. Further, travel exports had, until 1996, the largest share of total exports of services, exceeding 30 percent. Since then, exports of other private services have become the category with the largest share: nearly 45 percent in 2001. The counterpart to this increase is the decline in the export share of other transportation services: from 20 percent to 10 percent., 313=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers Number 836, August 2005 --- Screen Reader Version*, 41749=van Welsum, D., 2003, \"International Trade in Services: Issues and Concepts,\" Birkbeck College London, mimeo., 333897=4.\u00a0\u00a0Net exports of goods and net exports of services were quite close to zero from 1930 to 1976. \u00a0Return to text, 69321=Table A1:\u00a0\u00a0Long-run Income and Price Elasticities for Exports of Aggregate Services - 1987-2001: Alternative Estimation Methods and Automated Specification Algorithms, 41199=Marquez, J., 2002, Estimating Trade Elasticities, Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers., 39066=Deardorff, A., S.
