In the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $105 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $6 million in the three months ended March\u00a031, 2011.\u00a0 In the three months ended March\u00a031, 2011, we made tax payments of $75 million (including a federal income tax payment of $72 million related to our 2010 income tax obligations), while income tax payments of less than $1 million were made in the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012. The remaining increase in cash from operating activities was due to reduced expenditures, lower interest payments due to our lower debt obligations, and lower severance payments, partially offset by lower cash collections associated with lower revenues., 546160=Three Months Ended March\u00a031, 2012 Compared to Three Months Ended March\u00a031, 2011, 452907=During the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded severance expense of $2 million and $7\u00a0million, respectively. For the same periods, the Company paid severance benefits of $2 million and $4\u00a0million, respectively., 624643=We believe the net cash provided by our operating activities and existing cash and cash equivalents will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital requirements, estimated principal and interest debt service requirements and other cash needs for the remainder of 2012., 663776=Maximum\u00a0Number of\u00a0Shares\u00a0That\u00a0May Yet\u00a0Be\u00a0Purchased Under\u00a0the\u00a0Plans\u00a0or Programs, 268529=During the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012, the Company recorded a non-taxable gain of $28 million related to the early extinguishment of a portion of our senior secured term loans at below par.\u00a0 For additional information related to the Company\u0092s debt obligations, see Note 5., 700614=Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized., 629052=There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since December\u00a031, 2011. For additional information on critical accounting policies, see \u0093Item 7. Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u0094 in Part\u00a0II of our Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2011., 396959=Amortization expense for intangible assets was $34 million and $37 million for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 and 2011, respectively.\u00a0 These amounts include amortization expense related to capitalized internal-use software of $6 million and $9 million for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 and 2011, respectively., 353184=The following table sets forth the carrying amount and fair value of the Company\u0092s total debt obligations at March\u00a031, 2012 and December\u00a031, 2011:, 489455=The 2009 Plan provides for grants of stock options. These awards are classified as equity awards based on the criteria established by the applicable accounting rules\u00a0for stock-based compensation., 461778=Outstanding restricted stock at January\u00a01, 2012, 341349=The following table sets forth certain financial information related to cash payments made by the Company during the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 and 2011:, 417956=On November\u00a08, 2011, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Loan Agreement. The terms of the Second Amendment allow the Company, effective upon the execution of the amendment and until January\u00a01, 2014, to repurchase and retire debt below par, subject to certain requirements., 603578=The following table sets forth a summary of the Company\u0092s cash flows for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 and 2011:, 458851=A portion of the cost related to these awards has been included in the Company\u0092s compensation expense for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 and March\u00a031, 2011, respectively., 251617=Certain employees and certain non-management directors have been granted restricted stock awards, which entitles those participants to receive non-forfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of the Company\u0092s common stock. As such, these unvested restricted stock awards meet the definition of a participating security. Participating securities are defined as unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. At March\u00a031, 2012 and 2011, respectively, there were 372,388 and 386,703 such participating securities outstanding. Under the two-class method, all earnings, whether distributed or undistributed, are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends., 489989=During 2010 and 2011, certain employees were granted stock option awards that vest over three years in equal installments of one-third on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date and have a ten year term from the date of grant., 522274=On April\u00a020, 2009, a lawsuit was filed in the district court of Tarrant County, Texas, against certain of the Company\u0092s officers and directors (but not against the Company or its subsidiaries) on behalf of Jack B. Corwin as Trustee of The Jack B. Corwin Revocable Trust, and Charitable Remainder Stewardship Company of Nevada, and as Trustee of the Jack B. Corwin 2006 Charitable Remainder Unitrust (the \u0093Corwin\u0094 case).\u00a0 The Corwin case generally alleges that at various times in 2008 and 2009, the named Company officers and directors made false and misleading representations, or failed to state material facts, which made their statements misleading regarding the Company\u0092s financial performance and condition.\u00a0 The suit brings fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims and alleges violations of the Texas Securities Act and Section\u00a027 of the Texas Business Commerce Code.\u00a0 The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages, exemplary damages, and reimbursement for litigation expenses.\u00a0 On June\u00a03, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with the same allegations adding two additional Company directors as party defendants.\u00a0 On June\u00a010, 2010, the court in the Buettgen case granted the Company\u0092s motion staying discovery in the Corwin case pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.\u00a0 After the adverse decision in the Buettgen case, the parties agreed to a scheduling order consistent with the prior Buettgen stay order.\u00a0 The Company plans to honor its indemnification obligations and vigorously defend the lawsuit on the defendants\u0092 behalf., 702829=May\u00a09, 2012, 55284=Some statements included in this report constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the federal securities laws. Statements that include the words \u0093may,\u0094 \u0093will,\u0094 \u0093could,\u0094 \u0093should,\u0094 \u0093would,\u0094 \u0093believe,\u0094 \u0093anticipate,\u0094 \u0093forecast,\u0094 \u0093estimate,\u0094 \u0093expect,\u0094 \u0093preliminary,\u0094 \u0093intend,\u0094 \u0093plan,\u0094 \u0093project,\u0094 \u0093outlook\u0094 and similar statements of a future or forward-looking nature identify forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these statements.\u00a0 These forward-looking statements include statements that reflect the current views of our senior management with respect to our financial performance and future events with respect to our business and industry in general.\u00a0 Forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the risks related to the following:, 542073=We have been experiencing reduced advertising sales and revenue over the past several years driven by reduced advertiser renewals, reflecting continued competition from other advertising media (including the Internet, cable television, newspaper and radio) and a weak economy. For the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012, net advertising sales declined 17.4% compared to the same period in 2011. For the three months ended March\u00a031, 2011, net advertising sales declined 17.3% compared to the same period in 2010. If the factors driving these declines continue, then we will continue to experience declining advertising sales and revenues., 514625=Income taxes for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 and 2011 have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements on the basis of an estimated annual effective tax rate. In determining the estimated annual effective tax rate, the Company included interest expense and the tax effect of other one-time discrete items. The Company anticipates the effective tax rate, including interest expense and other one-time discrete items, to approximate 29% for 2012 which includes an estimated rate reduction for non-taxable cancellation of indebtedness income (\u0093CODI\u0094) related to the Company\u0092s below par debt repurchases. Generally, the discharge of a debt obligation for an amount less than its adjusted issue price creates CODI, which must be included in the Company\u0092s taxable income; however, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code will allow the Company to permanently exclude this CODI from taxation.\u00a0 Without this non-taxable CODI, our anticipated effective tax rate would approximate 37% for 2012. Our estimated effective tax rate for 2012 may be subject to changes in future periods. The full year effective tax rate for 2011 was (8.7%) primarily due to the impact of the large non-deductible component of a goodwill impairment charge.\u00a0 The full year effective tax rate for 2011 was also impacted by the non-taxable CODI generated by a below par debt repurchase in 2011., 646068=pension plans and the Company employee benefits committee (the \u0093EBC\u0094) and pension plans.\u00a0 All three named plaintiffs are receiving the single life monthly annuity pension benefits. All complain that Verizon transferred them against their will from the Verizon pension plans to the Company pension plans at or near the Company\u0092s spin-off from Verizon.\u00a0 The complaint alleges that both the Verizon and Company defendants failed to provide requested plan documents, which would entitle the plaintiffs to statutory penalties under the Employee Retirement Income Securities Act (\u0093ERISA\u0094); that both the Verizon and Company defendants breached their fiduciary duty for refusal to disclose pension plan information; and other class action counts aimed solely at the Verizon defendants. The plaintiffs seek class action status, statutory penalties, damages and a reversal of the employee transfers.\u00a0 The Company defendants filed their motion to dismiss the entire complaint on March\u00a010, 2010.\u00a0 On October\u00a018, 2010, the Court ruled on the pending motion dismissing all the claims against the Company pension plans and all of the claims against the Company\u0092s EBC relating to the production of documents and statutory penalties for failure to produce same.\u00a0 The only claims remaining against the Company are procedural ERISA claims against the Company\u0092s EBC.\u00a0 On November\u00a01, 2010, the Company\u0092s EBC filed its answer to the complaint.\u00a0 On November\u00a04, 2010, the Company\u0092s EBC filed a motion to dismiss one of the two remaining procedural ERISA claims against the EBC.\u00a0 Pursuant to an agreed order, the plaintiffs have obtained class certification against the Verizon defendants and discovery has commenced. After obtaining permission from the Court, the Plaintiffs filed another amendment to the complaint, alleging a new count against the Company\u0092s EBC.\u00a0 The Company\u0092s EBC filed another motion to dismiss the amended complaint and have filed a summary judgment motion before the deadline set by the scheduling order.\u00a0 On March\u00a026, 2012, the Court denied the Company\u0092s EBC\u0092s motion to dismiss. The parties\u0092 summary judgments remain pending. The Company plans to honor its indemnification obligations and defend the lawsuit on the defendants\u0092 behalf., 402521=At\u00a0December\u00a031, 2011, 451495=The Company sponsors a defined contribution savings plan to provide opportunities for eligible employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis and non-tax-deferred basis. Substantially all of the Company\u0092s employees are eligible to participate in the plan.\u00a0 Under the plan, a certain percentage of eligible employee contributions are matched with Company cash allocated to the participants\u0092 current investment elections. The Company recognizes savings plan expenses based on its matching obligation attributable to participating employees. \u00a0The Company recorded total savings plan expenses of $1\u00a0million and $4 million for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 and 2011, respectively., 351803=The Company\u0092s financial assets or liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents held in money market funds.\u00a0 The Company\u0092s money market funds of $67 million and $66 million as of March\u00a031, 2012 and December\u00a031, 2011, respectively, have been recorded at fair value using Level 2 inputs.\u00a0 The Company had $6 million held in certificates of deposit (\u0093CD\u0092s\u0094) at March\u00a031, 2012 and December\u00a031, 2011, that serve as collateral against letters of credit held with our insurance carriers.\u00a0 These CD\u0092s are classified as prepaid expenses and other on the consolidated balance sheets and are valued using Level 2 inputs. The fair value of the Company\u0092s money market funds and CD\u0092s classified as Level 2 are determined based on observable market data.\u00a0 The fair values of trade receivables and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature. The fair values of debt instruments are determined using Level 2 inputs based on the observable market data of a private exchange., 660353=The following table provides information about shares repurchased from employees during the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 as payment of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awarded to employees pursuant to the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan:, 415143=On December\u00a031, 2009, the Company emerged from bankruptcy and entered into a loan agreement with certain financial institutions and with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent. On December\u00a013, 2010 and November\u00a08, 2011, the loan agreement was amended (the \u0093Loan Agreement\u0094). Under the Loan Agreement, the senior secured term loans bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the Company\u0092s option, either (i)\u00a0the Alternate Base Rate (\u0093ABR\u0094) plus an Applicable Margin, or (ii)\u00a0adjusted London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u0093LIBOR\u0094) plus an Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin is 7.0% for loans with interest rates determined by reference to ABR and 8.0% for loans with interest rates determined by reference to adjusted LIBOR.\u00a0 The senior secured term loans have a floor interest rate of 4.0% in the case of ABR and 3.0% in the case of LIBOR.\u00a0 As long as interest rates remain at or below 4.0% for ABR and 3.0% for LIBOR, which is currently the case, our effective interest rate will be 11.0%., 314205=Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) \u0096 December\u00a031, 2011, 243952=The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u0093U.S. GAAP\u0094).\u00a0 Pursuant to the rules\u00a0and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u0093SEC\u0094), the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items and accruals, necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of SuperMedia Inc. and its subsidiaries.\u00a0 These unaudited interim financial statements do not contain all information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, as such, should be read in conjunction with the Company\u0092s Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2011.\u00a0 The results of operations for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for the 2012 fiscal year., 19225=Indicate by check mark whether the Registrant has filed all documents and reports required to be filed by Sections 12, 13 or 15(d)\u00a0of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 subsequent to the distribution of securities under a plan confirmed by the court. x\u00a0Yes\u00a0o No, 7090=Commission File Number: 1-32939, 632253=Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since December\u00a031, 2011. For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about our market risk, see \u0093Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks\u0094 in Part\u00a0II of our Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2011., 323124=The following table sets forth additional information on the Company\u0092s accounts payable and accrued liabilities at March\u00a031, 2012 and December\u00a031, 2011:, 246240=In May\u00a02011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u0093FASB\u0094) issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-04 (\u0093ASU 2011-04\u0094), \u0093Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs,\u0094 which amends Accounting Standards Codification 820, \u0093Fair Value Measurement.\u0094 The amended guidance changes the wording used to describe many requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. Additionally, the amendments clarify the FASB\u0092s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements. The guidance provided in ASU 2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December\u00a015, 2011 and is applied prospectively. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2011-04 as required., 722351=**\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These exhibits are furnished herewith.\u00a0 In accordance with Rule\u00a0406T of Regulation S-T, these exhibits are not deemed to be filed or part of a registration statement or prospectus for purposes of Section\u00a011 or 12 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, are not deemed to be filed for purposes of Section\u00a018 of the Securities Act of 1934 as amended and otherwise are not subject to liability under these sections., 397584=Amortization expense is estimated to be $130 million in 2012, $106 million in 2013, and $101 million in 2014 for the intangible assets as of March\u00a031, 2012., 5166=For the quarterly period ended March\u00a031, 2012, 457989=During 2010, 2011 and 2012, certain non-management directors were granted restricted stock awards that vest one year after the grant date.\u00a0 All unvested shares of restricted stock will immediately terminate if a non-management director ceases to be a member of the board of directors of the Company on or before the vesting date.\u00a0 If a change in control occurs on or before the vesting date, all unvested shares of restricted stock will immediately vest.\u00a0 Grant award recipients would receive all regular cash dividends if the Company were to declare dividends., 419259=The Company has a mandatory debt principal payment due after each fiscal quarter prior to the December\u00a031, 2015 maturity date on the outstanding senior secured term loans in an aggregate amount equal to 67.5% of the amount of any increase in the Company\u0092s Available Cash, as defined in the Loan Agreement.\u00a0 The Company has the right to make early payments at par on the senior secured term loans in whole or in part, from time to time, without premium or penalty, subject to requirements as to size and manner of payments.\u00a0 Additionally, the Company can make below par voluntary repurchases of the senior secured term loans, subject to the terms and conditions of the Second Amendment to the Loan Agreement., 242759=We primarily operate as the official publisher in the markets in which Verizon Communications Inc.

This final order gave the Publishers the opportunity to file a full consolidated appeal to the 9th\u00a0Circuit, which has been fully briefed and argued.\u00a0 We await the order of the court., 479052=Outstanding RSUs at January\u00a01, 2012, 597533=Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense of $40 million in the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 decreased $4 million, or 9.1%, compared to $44 million in the three months ended March\u00a031, 2011.\u00a0 This decrease was primarily due to lower amortization expense associated with capitalized internal use software., 687301=2012 Short Term Incentive Plan (incorporated by reference to the Registrant\u0092s Current Report on Form\u00a08-K, filed February\u00a022, 2012).*, 19996=As of May\u00a04, 2012, there were 15,455,994 shares of the Registrant\u0092s common stock outstanding., 66623=The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u0093SEC\u0094), including the information in \u0093Item 1A. Risk Factors\u0094 in Part\u00a0I of our Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2011. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. All forward-looking statements included in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.\u00a0 The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and, other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise., 601458=Provision for income taxes of $26 million in the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 increased $10 million, compared to $16 million in the three months ended March\u00a031, 2011, primarily due to the impact of the items listed above. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 and 2011 were 29.5% and 34.8%, respectively. The results for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012 and 2011, include the effects of one-time discrete items.\u00a0 We anticipate our effective tax rate, including interest expense and other one-time discrete items, to approximate 29% for 2012 which includes an estimated rate reduction for non-taxable cancellation of indebtedness income (\u0093CODI\u0094) related to the Company\u0092s below par debt repurchases. Generally, the discharge of a debt obligation for an amount less than its adjusted issue price creates CODI, which must be included in the Company\u0092s taxable income; however, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code will allow the Company to permanently exclude this CODI from taxation.\u00a0 Without this non-taxable CODI, our anticipated effective tax rate would approximate 37% for 2012. Our estimated effective tax rate for 2012 may be subject to changes in future periods. The full year effective tax rate for 2011 was (8.7%), primarily due to the impact of the large non-deductible component of a goodwill impairment charge.\u00a0 The full year effective tax rate for 2011 was also impacted by the non-taxable CODI generated by a below par debt repurchase in 2011., 600382=The Company recorded a non-taxable gain of $28 million related to the early extinguishment of a portion of our senior secured term loans in the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012.\u00a0 The Company utilized $31 million in cash to prepay $60 million of the senior secured term loans at a rate of 52% of par.\u00a0 This transaction resulted in the Company recording a non-taxable gain of $28 million ($29 million gain offset by $1 million in administrative fees)., 623564=During the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012, the Company made cash debt payments of $35 million, which reduced the Company\u0092s debt obligations by $64 million.\u00a0 On March\u00a02, 2012, the Company utilized $31 million in cash to prepay $60 million of the senior secured term loans at a rate of 52% of par.\u00a0 This transaction resulted in the Company recording a $28 million non-taxable gain ($29 million gain offset by $1 million in administrative fees), which was recorded as early extinguishment of debt on the Company\u0092s 2012 consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the three months ended March\u00a031, 2012, the Company also made additional debt principal payments, at par, of $4 million.\u00a0 The Company may make additional below par debt repurchases during 2012., 73662=2011, 453897=The 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \u00932009 Plan\u0094) provides for several forms of incentive awards to be granted to designated eligible employees, non-management directors, consultants and independent contractors providing services to the Company.
