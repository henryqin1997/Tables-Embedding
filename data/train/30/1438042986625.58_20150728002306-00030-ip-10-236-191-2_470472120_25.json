Many processor architectures are available as embedded devices with ARM and x86-based devices being readily available. In an embodiment, an x86-based system-on-chip (SOC) device such as National Semiconductor Geode SC2220 was selected as embedded processor 303. Since this is an embedded device, a flash disk 302 is connected to host IDE port 329, which can, as would be apparent, allow for firmware updates of WIDS node 120. Other flash-based storages such as disk on chip (DOC) or compact flash could also be used. Memory 301 interfaces to embedded processor 303 via host memory interface 306, as would be apparent. Test headers 307 are provided on the CRT and keyboard ports as well as the console UART 328. In this instance, a camera input is provided by embedded processor 303 for optional camera 308 connections. This can be used to provide such things as visual verification and video capture for later prosecutions of suspected intruders, along with any other purposes that would be served by having video information.}",

Alternatively, the user could login to access the WID system over a private network, such as a corporate intranet. A user can have one or more authorization levels. In an embodiment, the authorization levels can include a customer client, customer administrator, field engineer, or root administrator. A customer client or customer administrator can be associated with different groups or business units within the customer organization.}",

Various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein. . The POC table allows the WID system to manage the level of access of each user. Via entry of a username and associated password authentication, the corresponding privileges will be granted to each specific user. Attempts to access different levels within the web page that are outside of the specific privileges associated with a user can cause a login window to appear, which will prompt the users to enter additional authentication information to gain the access to a specific level. FIG. 9 According to the different access levels listed above, a POC table that maintains the roles of users is created in the database depicted in View userlog data 1078: This interface allows viewing from the management console of the log of WIDS collector access attempts by users.
