            "Mature students, working parents, here's our school!!!",
            "Ask to audit or observe a class at the school you're thinking about, then have a list of questions for the teacher, counselor, and students. If I would've done this, my student loans would not be as high as they are now. Do the leg work and ask questions!!!",
            "If what I've personally seen is any indication, this is worth the money.",
            "Like any place, it's what you make of it. So far, I'm enjoying most of the people I interact with as far as students and staff alike.",
            "The unique quality about this school that I've seen so far is that they focus a great deal in developing team building and group activities. This a different outlook than I'm used to. Unlike other schools, the books in the classes I've taken have been e-books. A stronger emphasis is placed on electronic education, so I hope you have a strong MS Office knowledge."
