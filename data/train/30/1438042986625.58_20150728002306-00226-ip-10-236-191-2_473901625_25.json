OGX2 (SEQ ID NO: 4), the oligonucleotide containing 5 universal bases, bound with a differential melting temperature of \u221217\ufffd C. relative to the perfect match. The slight difference of \u22126\ufffd C. in melting temperature using the control probe (OGC2) is undetectable using most diagnostic methods.

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{149000=One of the most frequent mutations is a G to A base change (G845A at position 1066). If the wild type and mutant alleles need to be detected, or diagnosed, on the basis of the SNP at position 1066 (shown below), the SNP Discrimination Table can be used to design more discriminatory probes than those based on natural bases alone (where C=5-methyl-dC and T=2-thio-dT)., 86412=A polyacrylamide gel bandshift experiment was then conducted as follows. The gel matrix was 20% acrylamide (19:1 acrylamide to bis-acrylamide) in 1\ufffdTBE buffer and \u201cextra\u201d salts: 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH=7.5 at 20\ufffd C., 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM DTT, 2.5% w/v sucrose. Oligonucleotide mixtures were at approximately 5 micromolar each in formamide/dye sample buffer plus 2\ufffd of the extra salt concentrations in the acrylamide gel mixture. The gel was run in 1\ufffdTBE at 93V (19 mA) and the buffer and gel temperatures were kept stable at 26\ufffd C. during the entire electrophoretic run., 26000=Recently, investigators have determined that modified oligonucleotides containing universal bases provide some benefit over conventional oligonucleotide chemistries. (See Guo et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,233, filed Jun. 6, 1996). Although Guo et al., observed some improvement in being able to discriminate a variant nucleotide in a target nucleic acid by incorporating solitary universal bases (artificial mismatches) sprinkled throughout a probe oligonucleotide, particular spacing and composition requirements were necessary. For example, Guo et al. found that the universal base should be carefully spaced from the variant nucleotide (i.e., 3 or 4 nucleotides away) and that the oligonucleotide probes should not contain a total composition of universal bases of greater than 15%., 128359=The C282Y mutation is determined by the TaqMan\u2122 technology, which is based on the use of two fluorescent dyes (a reporter and a quencher), both attached to the probe. During PCR, the probe anneals to the target sequence between the forward and the reverse primer sites. If hybridization occurs, the probe is cleaved by the 5\u2032-nuclease activity of the polymerase. This separates the reporter from the quencher, generating an increase in the reporter's fluorescence. Differences in fluorescence facilitate discrimination of all HFE genotypes at the 282 position. The Taqman\u2122 method is described in Kazuko, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,952,202, issued Sep. 14, 1999 (herein expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety)., 22547=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/142,729 filed May 8, 2002 now abandoned, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application 60/306229, filed Jul. 18, 2001.

This application claims priority to all of the aforementioned applications, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties., 85878=The melting behavior of control probes (i.e., no universal and generic bases) OGC1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and OGC2 (SEQ ID NO: 2) annealed to two different target DNA's: #1088 (SEQ ID NO: 7), which contains a G to C match, and #1090 (SEQ ID NO: 8), which contains a G-G mismatch, were compared to the melting behaviors of probes containing universal and generic bases. The universal or generic base containing probes analyzed included 5\u2032 OGX1 (SEQ ID NO: 3), 5\u2032OGX2 (SEQ ID NO: 4), and 5\u2032 OGX5 (SEQ ID NO: 6)., 77165=Melting temperatures were determined for the following three probes containing generic and universal bases in various salt concentrations and the results were compared to those obtained using a control probe without the generic and universal bases (5\u2032 natural OGC2). The probes analyzed included 5\u2032 OGX1 (SEQ ID NO: 3), 5\u2032OGX3 (SEQ ID NO: 5), 5\u2032 OGX5 (SEQ ID NO: 6) and 5\u2032 natural OGC2 (SEQ ID NO: 2). The target was #1088 (SEQ ID NO: 7). Oligonucleotide probes and DNA targets were at 0.35 to 0.40 O.D. each per milliliter in both an enzymatically relevant buffer system (KCl/Mg++) or in a non-physiological, high salt buffer system (NaCl/PO4\u2212\u2212):, 199800=Within this application, unless otherwise stated, the techniques utilized may be found in any of several well-known references including: Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (Sambrook, et al., 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press), Gene Expression Technology (Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 185, edited by D. Goeddel, 1991.

Liss, Inc. New York, N.Y.), and Gene Transfer and Expression Protocols, pp. 109-128, ed. E. J. Murray, The Humana Press Inc., Clifton, N.J.)., 25036=Oligonucleotide hybridization is a method commonly used in the field of molecular biology for the treatment and diagnosis of disease, as well as the identification, quantitation, and isolation of nucleic acids. Accordingly, it is important to identify methods to increase the specificity and affinity of oligonucleotides for their targets. In this way, diagnostics which provide efficient and precise answers can be made. Various methods for increasing the specificity of oligonucleotides are known in the art, including increasing the length, choosing oligonucleotides that are not likely to cross-hybridize or bind non-specifically and designing oligonucleotides that have a high annealing temperature. (See e.g., Bergstrom et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117:1201-1209, 1995; Nicols et al., Nature 369:4920493, 1994; Loakes, Nucl. Acids Res. 22:4039-4043, 1994; Brown, Nucl. Acids Res. 20:5149-5152, 1992)., 87033=The polyacrylamide gel was scanned, lanes 1-12, and the oligonucleotide probe/DNA target sequences were analyzed. Probe and DNA target designations are provided in TABLE 3. Lanes 11 and 12 of the gel marked the position of unbound target DNAs (#1088, perfect match and #1090, single base mismatch, respectively)., 135461=In particular, a single melting curve assay such as that in the reference, Donohue et al. Clin Chem 2000; 46:1540-7 is used for the rapid detection of the HFE C282Y mutation that utilizes real-time multiplex, allele-specific PCR and melting curves but requires neither fluorescent hybridization probes nor any postamplification manual processing. In particular, this C282Y genotyping assay requires the design of two unlabeled allele-specific sense-strand PCR primers (and a common antisense primer) to specifically amplify (in the same tube) either the C282 or Y282 allele (or both, in the case of heterozygotes)., 130858=The HybProbe\u2122 assay is also called a two-color melting curve assay. HybProbe\u2122 chemistry consists in two adjacent probes in a head-to-tail orientation, spaced by one to four nucleotides. The probes hybridize to adjacent sequences. One of the probes is labeled at its 3\u2032 end by a donor dye (generally flurescein). The other probe is labeled with an acceptor molecule at its 5\u2032 end (generally LC Red640 or 705), and is phosphate-blocked at the 3\u2032 end. When both probes are hybridized to their target sequences, the emitted light of the donor is transmitted to the acceptor fluorophore by F\ufffdrster resonance energy transfer (FRET), and the Red640 emitted fluorescence (640 nm) can be detected. The intensity of the emitted fluorescence increases in parallel with the target DNA formed in the PCR. The LightCycler probes offer the advantage over the TaqMan\u2122 probe of not requiring hydrolysis and, therefore, no additional extension of the PCR times (annealing-elongation\u226612 s). A method such as that in US patent applications: Wittwer et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,079, issued May 15, 2001 and Wittwer et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,054, issued Oct. 31, 2000 (both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties) is used., 87378=Lanes 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the gel showed that the all-natural-base probes (OGC1 and OGC2) could not distinguish the single base mismatch target (#1090, lanes 2 and 4) from the perfectly matched target (#1088, lanes 1 and 3). Lanes 5 through 10, on the other hand, graphically revealed the ability of the probes containing juxtaposed universal bases to detect a single-base-mismatch under these conditions. Thus, the results above provide more evidence that antisense oligonucleotides comprising juxtaposed universal bases are more specific for a target than conventional oligonucleotides, which translates into improved antisense inhibition., 118089=The polyacrylamide gel bandshift experiment is conducted as above. The gel matrix is 20% acrylamide (19:1 acrylamide to bis-acrylamide) in 1\ufffdTBE buffer and \u201cextra\u201d salts: 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH=7.5 at 20\ufffd C., 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM DTT, 2.5% w/v sucrose. Oligonucleotide mixtures are at approximately 5 micromolar each in formamide/dye sample buffer plus 2\ufffd of the extra salt concentrations in the acrylamide gel mixture. The gel is run in 1\ufffdTBE at 93V (19 mA) and the buffer and gel temperatures are kept stable at 26\ufffd C. during the entire electrophoretic run., 26816=Van Ness et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,361,940, filed Apr. 1, 1998) also found that the incorporation of universal bases (specificity spacers) could increase the specificity of a probe oligonucleotide for a target nucleic acid. As above, however, Van Ness et al. determined that the universal bases should be spaced a considerable distance from each other (4-14 nucleotides). Thus, despite the advances made by the investigators above and others in the field, there still remains a need for better oligonucleotide chemistries, which allow for the development of more efficient diagnostics and therapeutics., 132118=Similar to the experiments described in example 7 of the Wittwer et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,079, issued May 15, 2001, the MTHFR SNP can be detected with the primers of the preferred embodiment in conjunction with a typical HybProbe\u2122 assay. There is a common point mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene (C.sub.677 T) that converts an alanine to a valine residue and results in a thermolabile enzyme. This mutation can reduce MTHFR activity and lead to elevated homocysteine plasma levels which has been implicated as an independent risk factor for early vascular disease and thrombosis as is well known in the art., 134422=Minor Groove binders are dsDNA-binding dyes. They are thought to bind to the minor groove of dsDNA and upon binding increase their fluorescence over a hundred fold. An example of such a dye is SYBR Green I\u2122. These dyes are compatible with PCR up to a point, but at very high concentrations may start to inhibit the PCR reaction. SYBR can be used with the LightCycler\u2122 in channel F1. An important quality of these dyes is that they bind to any dsDNA. The specific product, non-specific products, and primer dimers are detected equally well. Therefore, it is important that the PCR reaction is extremely \u201cclean\u201d and does not contain any dimers or non-specific products. The primers of the preferred embodiment can be used in any PCR reaction with a minor groove binder to make the method more specific. The embodied method is as described in Kutyavin, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,084,102, issued Jul. 4, 2000 (herein expressly incorporated by reference) except that the oligonucleotides described herein are used.}",
