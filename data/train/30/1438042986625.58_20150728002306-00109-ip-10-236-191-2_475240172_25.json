Briefly, test IAP binding compounds at various concentrations for binding measurements were mixed with 5 nM fluorescently labeled peptide (AbuRPF-K(5-Fam)-NH2) and 40 nM of XIAP-BIR3 for 15 minutes at room temperature in 100 \u03bcL of 0.1M Potassium Phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 containing 100 \u03bcg/ml bovine \u03b3-globulin. Following incubation, the polarization values (mP) were measured on a Victor2V using a 485 nm excitation filter and a 520 nm emission filter. IC50 values were determined from the plot using nonlinear least-squares analysis using GraphPad Prism. The Kd values of competitive inhibitors were calculated using the equation described by Zaneta Nikolovska-Coleska et al. based upon the measured IC50 values, the Kd value of the probe and XIAP BIR3 complex, and the concentrations of the protein and probe in the competition assay. In various examples of IAP binding or IAP binding cargo molecules ranges for Kd values: Group A: Kd<0.1 \u03bcM; Group B: Kd=0.1-1 \u03bcM; Group C: Kd=1-10 \u03bcM; Group D: Kd>10 \u03bcM., 386375=B.

The assays utilize a labeled IAP-binding peptide or peptidomimetic that binds to a BIR domain of an IAP, wherein at least one measurable feature of the label changes as a function of the IAP binding compound being bound to the IAP or free in solution. The BIR domain of an IAP is contacted with the labeled IAP peptide or peptidomimetic to form a complex, and the complex is exposed to a compound to be tested for BIR binding. Displacement of the labeled IAP peptide or peptidomimetic from the complex, if any, by the test compound, is measured., 477430=2S-Amino-N-{1S-[2S-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-pyrrolidine-1-carbonyl]-2-methyl-propyl}-propionamide (75): To a solution of 74 (0.12 g, 0.291 mmol) in dry MeOH (3 mL) was added 3 mL of 10% NaOH/MeOH.

Caspases are produced in cells as catalytically inactive zymogens and must be proteolytically processed to become active proteases during apoptosis. In normal surviving cells that have not received an apoptotic stimulus, most caspases remain inactive. Even if some caspases are aberrantly activated, their proteolytic activity can be fully inhibited by a family of evolutionarily conserved proteins called IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis proteins) (Deveraux & Reed, Genes Dev. 13: 239-252, 1999). Each of the IAPs contains 1-3 copies of the so-called BIR (baculoviral IAP repeat) domain and directly interacts with and inhibits the enzymatic activity of mature caspases. Several distinct mammalian IAPs including XIAP, survivin, and LIVIN/ML-IAP, (Kasof and Gomes, J. Biol. Chem. 276: 3238-3246, 2001; Vucic et al. Curr. Biol. 10: 1359-1366, 2000; Ashhab et al. FEBS Lett. 495: 56-60, 2001), have been identified and they exhibit anti-apoptotic activity in cell culture (Deveraux & Reed, 1999, supra). As IAPs are expressed in most cancer cells, they may directly contribute to tumor progression and subsequent resistance to drug treatment., 397725=A. 2S-(2-Bromo-benzofuran-3-ylmethyl)-pyrrolidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (38): A solution of 22 (1.4 g, 4.7 mmol) in CHCl3 (20 mL) was cooled to 0\ufffd C. and treated with KOAc (2.5 g, 26 mmol).
