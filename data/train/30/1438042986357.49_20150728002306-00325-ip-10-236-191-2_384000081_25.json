Hence peers 172.16.232.55 and 172.16.232.56 will get the local preference, next hop, and MED unmodified in the updates. The router at 10.16.69.1 is a normal eBGP speaker and the updates received by it from this peer will be just like a normal eBGP update from a peer in autonomous system 6001., 117963=RFC 1772, 119488=RFC 2858, 118567=RFC 1774, 119779=RFC 2918, 118278=RFC 1773, 119185=RFC 2519, 3258=The route dampening feature minimizes the flapping problem as follows. Suppose again that the route to network A flaps. The router in autonomous system 2 (where route dampening is enabled) assigns network A a penalty of 1000 and moves it to history state. The router in autonomous system 2 continues to advertise the status of the route to neighbors. The penalties are cumulative. When the route flaps so often that the penalty exceeds a configurable suppress limit, the router stops advertising the route to network A, regardless of how many times it flaps. Thus, the route is dampened., 5463=Penalty\u2014Each time a route flaps, the router configured for route dampening in another autonomous system assigns the route a penalty of 1000. Penalties are cumulative. The penalty for the route is stored in the BGP routing table until the penalty exceeds the suppress limit. At that point, the route state changes from history to damp., 6353=Suppress limit\u2014A route is suppressed when its penalty exceeds this limit. The default value is 2000.}",
