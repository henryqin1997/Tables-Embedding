It is not necessarily about recognising a lifetime contribution to geoscientific research, rather it acknowledges outstanding, sustained contributions made to the successful and continued operations of the GSNZ and the wider geoscience community. Only one Honorary Member shall be elected in any one year. This award arose from the amalgamation of the Geological Society of New Zealand and the New Zealand Geophysical Society in 2010. The award was first offered in 2011, and the first recipient of this prestigious GSNZ award was Dr Bruce Thompson.

It is sponsored by and draws its faculty from various US universities, research agencies and corporations, and has operated in New Mexico since 1983. SAGE participants are chosen from US and overseas countries. Since 2001, through an arrangement between the US organisers and the New Zealand Geophysical Society, one enrolment at SAGE has been available to one student from New Zealand.\u00a0 The SAGE Scholarship is awarded to the most suitable New Zealand candidate, with funding for attendance at SAGE provided by sponsorship from a number of institutions, and in some cases the Geoscience Society of New Zealand.

As part of the merger, funds were contributed by NZGeMS to the GSNZ Awards Trust to form a separate account (the NZGeMS Geochemistry Fund) from which the prize money for the Werner F Giggenbach Prize and other geochemistry prizes could be drawn.

Awards can be made either directly to the student to undertake his or her own fieldwork associated with a research project, or to a more senior researcher, to reimburse the expenses associated with including the student in the fieldwork. The latter is intended to encourage experienced fieldworkers to take along students who might otherwise not get a chance to work with them., 66529=2001, 72873=1987, 111120=The March 2007 Ruapehu Crater Lake breakout lahar, 200102=2009, 75096=1982, 79563=1972, 84964=1960, 73738=1985, 176384=Quaternary paleoceanography, ODP 1119, 47277=This prize is awarded in recognition of a lifetime of service in New Zealand geochemistry, and is awarded no more frequently than once every four years. This award was incorporated into the Geoscience Society of NZ (GSNZ) with the merger with the NZ Geochemical and Mineralogical Society in 2012. The first award, as a combined society, was offered in 2013. As part of the merger, funds were contributed by NZGeMS to the GSNZ Awards Trust to form a separate account (the NZGeMS Geochemistry Fund) from which funding to support the SH Wilson Prize and other geochemistry prizes could be drawn.

It aims to enhance the experience and knowledge of students of geophysics in an intense course of geophysical exploration and research that goes beyond classroom-based curricula. Much more than just a summer field camp, SAGE is a complete immersion in geophysics, an educational experience in which students participate in every phase of the field and interpretation programs. Participants collect data with modern equipment; process, model and interpret the data with workstations; and present their results in oral and written forms., 76436=1979, 24875=2015 Applications and Nominations to the Chair of the Awards Subcommittee, Jennifer Eccles (j.eccles_at_auckland.ac.nz) by the 18th of September 2015., 85419=1959}",
