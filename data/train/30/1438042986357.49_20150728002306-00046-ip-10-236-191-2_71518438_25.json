Footnote 2:For larger meetings, we recommend that you use the Cisco WebEx Event Center. Footnote 3: The Cisco MCS 7845-I3 Web Server supports a maximum of 600 web ports per server. However, the largest supported web meeting per server is subject to the size of the largest supported audio meeting per server.
