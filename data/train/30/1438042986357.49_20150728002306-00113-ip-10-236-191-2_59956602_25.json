Matt Leinart took over and connected on 10-of-14 passes for 74 yards for the Cardinals (7-3), who have started the season with five straight road wins for the first time since 1948., 48432=The Rams converted on three fourth downs before Jackson plunged into the end zone from one-yard out. A nice 25-yard grab by Danny Amendola on 4th-and-11 put the Rams at the one, setting up the score that cut the gap to 21-13 with 7:08 remaining., 49606=Arizona then bridged the first and second periods with a nine-play, 90-yard scoring drive. Warner found Fitzgerald in the end zone with an 11-yard pass to put the Cardinals ahead 14-3 with 11:48 to go until halftime., 48958=Arizona took over on downs with 3:42 to play before punting back to the Rams with 1:01 left on the clock and no timeouts. Bulger was sacked on first down and the Rams wound up with negative yardage on their final possession., 49835=St. Louis found some rhythm on offense during its next possession, but failed to convert on 4th-and-1 from the Arizona 22. The Cardinals went 78 yards the other way and made it a 21-3 game when Wells rumbled into the end zone from a yard out with 2:23 left., 49400=Following a series of punts, the Cardinals scored a touchdown on a six-play, 87-yard drive. Hightower's 50-yard run helped set up Boldin's five-yard TD catch for a 7-3 lead with 2:28 remaining.}",
