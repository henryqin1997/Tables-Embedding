They had to charge across open ground 600 yards to the works, exposed to the fire of artillery and musketry, and that part of the line they were to attack was manned by Armstrong's brigade, regarded as the best of Forrest's corps, and numbering 1500 strong.\u00a0 Long's division sprang forward in an unfaltering manner. Its flanks had some difficulty crossing a ravine and marshy soil, but in less than 15 minutes it had swept over the works and driven the Confederates in confusion toward the city.

Gen. N.B. Forrest is reputed to have pulled a marauding Federal soldier out from under a bed where he promptly shot him, sawed lumber from cypress trees from the Blue Girth Swamp containing metal from the battle, and witnessed the salvage of guns from the adjacent Alabama River. I call this essay \"The First Battle of Selma\" because there has since been another battle, almost 100 years later, that may have been much more significant in the minds of men, the March across the Pettus Bridge in 1964., 102049=On the 9th, Wilson's forces commenced evacuating the place by crossing the river on pontoons, and by the 10th his entire force had succeeded in crossing the river. Thousands of negroes had flocked to the Federal camps, of all ages and sex, and after crossing the river, four regiments were organized out of the able-bodied black men in and around the Federal camps. To these regiments proper officers were assigned, and those unable to bear arms were driven from the camps.\u00a0\u00a0 Gen. Wilson, in speaking of these regiments said, \"that in addition to subsisting themselves upon the country, they would march thirty-five miles in a day, and frequently forty.\" About four hundred wounded Federal soldiers were left behind in Selma, all huddled together in the different stories of the present hardware store of John K.

Oct 1888 all kids Al Al Al., 90862=Finally, in the winter of 1865, through the advice of Gen. Thomas, who commanded the department of Tennessee, Gen. Grant selected Maj. Gen. J. H. Wilson, a prudent and sagacious officer, for the task of capturing Selma, with an independent command. After a careful canvas of the question, Gen. Wilson selected from the Federal army of the west, a force of about thirteen thousand men, and encamped them at Gravel Springs on the Tennessee River. After a thorough drilling and equipment unsurpassed by any cavalry force of the world, on the evening of the 17th of March, 1865, this splendidly mounted and equipped force was ordered to march on the next morning. The Tennessee River was crossed, the force composed of the first, second and third divisions, commanded respectively by Gens. McCook, Long, and Upton, were in motion to strike a blow that would be felt by the Confederacy. After burning the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and destroying the iron works in Tannehill and Montevallo, this force moved on through the mountainous country of Alabama, and with scarcely any opposition, until the first day of April, at Ebenezer Church, near Dixie Station, on the Alabama and Tennessee railroad, 27 miles from Selma, Gen. Forrest made a stand; where it is said that Gen. Forrest and the brave Capt. Taylor, of the 17th Indiana Regiment had a running fight of over 300 yards, resulting in the death of Taylor---Forrest falling back upon Selma, pressed hard. On the night of the 10th of April, this force camped at Plantersville, 22 miles from Selma.\u00a0 Here Gen. Wilson was informed by spies from Selma, that it was the intention of Dick Taylor (Commander of Confederate forces) to evacuate the place and make no defense---that Forrest himself advised it, and for a time led Gen. Wilson to believe he would meet with no resistance at Selma. (Wilson's headquarters house is still standing in Plantersville)., 89985=The capacities and importance of Selma, in its relation to the Confederate movement, had been notorious in the North, and too great to be overlooked by the Federal authorities, as early as 1862.\u00a0 But to reach it with a Federal force baffled the ingenuity of the federal Generals.\u00a0 As the place grew in importance, the greater the necessity to reach it with a Federal force.\u00a0 Gen. Sherman first made an effort to reach it, but after advancing as far as Meridian, within one hundred and seven miles, retreated to the Mississippi River; Gen. Grierson, with a cavalry force from Memphis, was intercepted and returned; Gen. Rousseau made a dash in the direction of Selma, but was misled by his guides and struck the railroad forty miles east of Montgomery., 113177=----- Original Message ----- From: John Gwin Sent: Monday, May 26, 2003 2:54 PM To: Jerry Hill Subject: Re: Memorial Day, 114564=Do you know the address, or can you give me directions to the place on a map?\u00a0 I'm going there in July and have NO IDEA where to start looking. Your e.mail is a light in the darkness for me!\u00a0 I do know that Grandpa Sutt and Grandma Ida are buried there, and I've been there to see their graves and have pictures, but I'd love to know much more:\u00a0 What did he do?\u00a0 Where did they live?, 101293=The 2,700 prisoners, comprising almost every man in the city, were huddled together in a large stockade just north of the Selma and Meridian railroad track, on the east of the Range Line Road, near where the Matthews cotton factory now stands.This stockade was built and had been used by the Confederates. In this pen, in which a dry place scarcely large enough for a man to lay down could not be found, were the prisoners kept until Saturday morning, when they were all paroled and allowed to go wherever they pleased or could. On the 6th of April Gen. Wilson met Gen. Forrest at Cahaba, for the purpose of arranging for an exchange of prisoners, but no definite arrangement was effected., 97950=While matters were going on thus on the outside, it would be well for us to look on and see what was taking place on the inside.\u00a0 Gen. Wilson's visit had been expected for ten days, but the Confederate forces were so scattered over the country, and especially the cavalry part of it, that to centre a force at Selma was utterly impossible. Gen. Forrest's forces had been reduced to a mere handful, and really, the only reliable force in reach was Gen. Armstrong's, numbering only about fifteen hundred. There were a large number of \"boom-proof\" officers and stragglers in the city, upon whom little reliance could be placed.\u00a0 But on Saturday it was determined that the place should be defended. Everybody who could walk was called upon to go to the breastworks, with whatever arms could be procured.\u00a0 Squads of armed men were traversing the streets and examining various buildings for soldiers to go to the breastworks, sparing nothing that wore pantaloons, and by Sunday, 12 o'clock, there were collected in the ditches around the city, about four thousand persons, not more than two thousand of them reliable, to meet a force of nine thousand of the flower of the Federal army, and equipped in a manner unexampled in the history of ancient or modern armies.\u00a0 Confederate Gen. Dick Taylor left the city as fast as a steam engine could take him, about twelve o'clock on Sunday, leaving command of the city divided between Gens. Forrest, Adams and Armstrong, and as the latter had control of the only real force in the fight, was gallant enough to meet the invaders at the point of the first attack, on the Summerfield road, and Long's division felt the result.\u00a0 A large number of the women and children had been sent out of the city.\u00a0 A number of the quartermasters, too, had gone with their supplies, mostly to Meridian.\u00a0 The assault was made, and no one who comprehended affairs could doubt the result. The Federal forces, with the flush of victory, entered the city in the hour of night, and terrible scenes of plunder and outrages were witnessed in every direction., 105955=\u00a0\u00a0 281 i.

Wilson himself arriving about 1 o'clock. The guns mounted, the movement of soldiers, and various other demonstrations inside the breastworks, were too plain to leave resistance in doubt, and by four o'clock, the whole force was in position to make the attack.\u00a0 Gen C. C. Andrews, who was in the force, gives the following account of the assault on the city by Gen.Wilson., 87737=Because of its central location, production facilities and rail connections, the advantages of Selma as a site for production of cartridges, saltpetre, powder, shot and shell, rifles, cannon and steam rams soon became apparent to the Confederacy. By 1863 just about every war material was manufactured within the limits of Selma, employing at least ten thousand people within the city limits. The hull was laid for at least one Confederate ironclad, the Tennessee, and millions of dollars worth of army supplies were accumulated in and distributed from Selma., 112307=Let me stop writing and see what kind of pictures are still on my moniter that I can send you now.
