            "Multi-Protocol Network Registration and Address Resolution - The functionality of a C12.22 application layer is overlaid on an IP-based infrastructure, by employing an IP DNS server as the registration host for both IP- and C12.22-based communications. Communication can occur at either the IP layer or the C12.22 application layer. At the IP layer, a host application can interrogate network nodes. To extend this service to C12.22 communications, C12.22 registration and resolve services are implemented on the DNS server. Similar to the manner in which an IP-based service uses a native, IP-based DNS resolve request, a C12.22 host can utilize a C12.22 resolution request against the C12.22-enabled DNS server for C12.22 application-layer interrogation of endpoints",
            "MULTI-PROTOCOL NETWORK REGISTRATION AND ADDRESS RESOLUTION - The functionality of communications standards and protocols that are application-layer specific are overlaid on an IP-based infrastructure, by employing an IP DNS server as the registration host for IP and other communications standards based and protocol based communications. Communication can occur at either the IP layer or the communications standards or protocol application layer. At the IP layer, a host application can interrogate network nodes. To extend this service to other communications standards or protocol communications, device registration and resolve services are implemented on the DNS server. Similar to the manner in which an IP-based service uses a native, IP-based DNS resolve request, a host can utilize a resolution request against the communications standards and protocol-enabled DNS server for standards and protocol application-layer interrogation of endpoints."

Lew, Sunnyvale, CA US 06-27-2013 METER DISCONNECTION DETECTION SYSTEM AND METHOD - Methods, systems, and devices for detecting when an end-device is physically disconnected from a commodity delivery network. One method includes determining an impedance of a power input of the end-device after the end-device experiences a power interruption, generating a message including data regarding the impedance, transmitting the message to a computer-implemented back office over at least one communication network, and automatically setting a status of the end-device to a physically-disconnected status when the data regarding the impedance indicates the impedance is greater than a threshold. 20130162436 Published Description Patent application number Winston Lew, Sunnyvale, CA US //]]> BarDraw('2672176',['Patent applications by Willard Lew, San Mateo, CA US'],[[1,1,2,1,1,4,1,2,2]],['2005','2006','2008','2009','2010','2011','2012','2013','2014'],0); // <script type=\"text/javascript\"> </div> <div id=\"legend2672176\" align=\"center\"></div> </div> <canvas id=\"bg2672176\" style=\"max-width: 500px; width: 100%;\"></canvas> <div> <p align=\"center\">Patent applications by Willard Lew, San Mateo, CA US</p> <div class=\"bar2672176\" style=\"max-width: 500px; width: 100%; float:left; \"> <div align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top:20px;\"> </table> </tbody> </tr> <td>07-17-2014</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20140200188\">2'-FLUORO SUBSTITUTED CARBA-NUCLEOSIDE ANALOGS FOR ANTIVIRAL TREATMENT</a> - Provided are methods for treating Orthomyxoviridue virus infections by administering ribosides, riboside phosphates and prodrugs thereof, of Formula I:</td> <td>20140200188</td> <tr> </tr> <td>01-30-2014</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20140030223\">INHIBITORS OF FLAVIVIRIDAE VIRUSES</a> - Provided are compounds of Formula I:</td> <td>20140030223</td> <tr> </tr> <td>12-05-2013</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20130323203\">INHIBITORS OF FLAVIVIRIDAE VIRUSES</a> - Provided are compounds of Formula I:</td> <td>20130323203</td> <tr> </tr> <td>11-28-2013</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20130315861\">INHIBITORS OF FLAVIVIRIDAE VIRUSES</a> - Provided are compounds of",
