            "Sat mostly 92-95; FB is explosive and looks faster than listed velocity; shows extreme arm-side run at 92-95 velo band; mild boring action; excellent plane plays up the velocity and movement from FB; changes the eye level of the hitter; RHH have hard time picking pitch up out of his hand due to plane and movement; command is average; flashed better command in first four innings; flew open a few times in fifth and sixth innings; this caused a few FB to sail up in zone but hitters could not make sufficient contact; overall, a near elite potential offering that could be a terrific offering at the highest level; did not see the consistent elite pitch that was displayed in first time seeing, but still a plus-plus offering for most of the outing; command could still improve and extra velocity could come with more stamina gained; trailed off in sixth inning.",
            "Elite offering; very tight spin; extreme depth; 11-5 with terrific movement and looks faster than the actual listed velocity; shows two-plane break; hitters had a difficult time recognizing the pitch out of hand; near perfection in terms of replicating arm speed and action relative to FB; shows ability to pound outside half of plate to both sides; extreme confidence in this pitch and will throw at any time; clearly his go-to pitch and will challenge hitters with it in consecutive pitches; command was better than last viewing; currently solid-average; does not need to throw this for a strike to have effectiveness; casted only one out of a dozen thrown; release point showed better this outing.",
            "Flashed solid-average; arm speed is replicated from FB; release points were an issue; was releasing too early and leaving up in zone; command is currently fringe; pitch has mild feel; becomes too firm at times and looks like a slower FB without much fade; clearly a work-in-progress but has the ability to become at least an average offering and help counter the FB/CB combo; works best in the 81-82 velo band."

The defense and speed will carry him for now, but the bat has a bit to go before reaching its ceiling. The consistent, short stroke from Hart works often, although the production remains hollow at this time. Hart makes a ton of contact, but he is still learning the in's and out's of the game. I can see the development from early April simply from his approach at the plate. He is progressing even though there has been little evidence. Hart is going to see production once he gets more acclimated with professional ball. Some of his best AB this series was against Giolito, where he showed progression and refinement from his first AB to the last. Hart has high risk because the tools are raw currently. He will move slow and is the type of player who will need to make a stop at every level, likely for an entire year. The defense can get him to the majors alone, but the bat could end up being average. This is a speedy, leadoff type who could provide a little sparkplug atop a lineup., 75401=Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 Baseball Prospectus, LLC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Surprise Me!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Overall Nootbaar is an advanced college arm who should move quickly through the system. He flashes a plus FB and CB that both could use a slight refinement in command before he reaches his ceiling. There is minimal projection left here, but a slight tick of growth into his frame could bring a mild increase in velocity. Nootbaar does a solid job of keeping his FB low in the zone and picking off hitters with the hard CB offering. He should roll through the lower minors and face his first real challenges at the A+/AA levels. The one concern is the straight FB, which does get a slight improvement due to the deceptiveness and explosion of the offering. If he can refine the command, this is a RP that could help a big-league club in the next year or two.",
