If you can visit during March madness so you really get a feel for being a true Jayhawk., 108859=Paying tuition is probably the most difficult. I only have 24 credit hours left, so as graduation comes around the corner so does the thoughts of all the student loans I will soon be having to pay. I also pay more for being in the School of Business, which exceeds my max yearly student loans, so I've ended up paying about $1000 out of pocket the last few semesters., 607315=KU is a good university to attend with multiple schools and majors to school from. The whole city of Lawrence has a nice college town feel. Lawrence is a safe city that parents wont have to worry about dropping them off in August., 792337=Join a Class of 20XX group before enrolling. I would recommend going to Facebook and searching University of Kansas - Class of 2018 and join that group., 577201=I moved here in 2012 from the big city of Dallas. The campus is beautiful and the weather is perfect. If you love the snow like me you will love KU. the classes are somewhat enjoyable. The basketball life and social life isnt bad either!, 193709=*1. On Tuesday, August 18, 2009; The University of Kansas noted that 20% of freshmen drop out after their first year; KU freshmen are not ready for the rigors of campus life; the University of Kansas continued to state that the current standard adopted in 1996 were too lenient. * 2. The importance of an Institution of Higher Learning is to view its accreditation; The University of Kansas through the ncahlc.org; is listed as an accredited Institution of Higher Learning. *3. The University of Kansas finialized the ten steps: 1. Letter of Inquiry; 2. Pre-Application Interview; 3. Post-Interview Commission Letter; 4. Letter of Intent to submit the preliminary information form (PIF); 5. Preliminary information form (PIF): Institutional Submissions; 6. Preliminary Information Form (PIF): review; 7. Letter of Intent to Pursue Candidacy; 8. completion of the self-study and compre- hensive site visit for candidacy; 9. Award and duration of candidacy; 10. Initial Accreditation; with attenui of the FIVE CRITERIA: 1. Mission and Integrity; 2. Preparing for the future; 3. Student learning and effective teaching; 4. Acquisition, discovery, and application of knowledge; 5. Engagement and service; (HLC) The Higher Learning Institution accredits the entire institution of the University of Kansas; and not partial accreditation; finally, there is a mark of affiliation for an institution to facilitate the web sites; the mark is attainable in two versions; the mark is a key component of the commission's statement to strengthen the provision to the public of information referencing accreditation relationship : the commission and the institution. JLF., 259331=A big focus at KU is traditions! Getting thrown in the fountain on your birthday, celebrating March Madness on Mass. Street, and camping out for seats for basketball games are just a few of the many traditions at KU., 135247=Mrs. E's isn't the greatest. If there hadn't been a salad bar, I probably would have starved. The service is poor and the food is often overcooked, undercooked, or incredibly greasy. Nevertheless, the dining hall food is convenient and open from 7-7:30 Mon-Fri. One thing that was annoying is that they didn't serve breakfast on the weekends, which for early risers is a nuisance., 691558=I am convinced that Allen Fieldhouse is the most tradition-rich place in the entire country. Basketball games have become more of a ritual than a game. Another of my favorite traditions is walking down the hill before graduation, something I'm looking forward to doing this May., 950003=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 32838=Although KU has quite the reputation of a party school, it's not impossible to have a lot of fun AND receive a quality education. Also contrary to popular belief, every single class does NOT have a roster of at least 1000 students, and if a class does have a large amount of students, there is usually a personalized discussion section once a week offered for those who would like a smaller class size., 640082=Like any other mass producing dinning area not the best, but getting better! Mrs. E's the dinning location on the Hill is going under reconstruction. If it is like the renovations by Corbin and GSP the food and atmosphere should be a lot better! Construction will be done for incoming students for the 2013 fall semester!, 189434=*1. The FINAL FOUR-DENVER WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; cycling club: Andy White; Social rides @ 5:00 pm from Jayhawk in front of Strong Hall; *2. Some famous locations: Allen Field House-Kwan Wu; Adams Alumni Center- 13th & Oread - Jayhawk Statue; and the Spooner Hall- 'trees & other ramifications: branches in nature and culture. *3. Swedish Club and Sophmore Leadership Club. JLF., 186232=*1. Campus safety : In 1991 the US Congress passed the student right to know and campus security act; it requires colleges to report the three previous years of crime statistics and campus security information and policies. *2. The University of Kansas recognizes the importance for an Institution of Higher Learning to develop and maintain a safe and secure enviroment in which the academic and social pursuits of its members can be fully realized. *3.

Oliver; Chris Keary; Elizabeth Phillips; Mark D. Witt; Rhonda Birdsong; Schulyer Bailey. JLF., 190108=*1. KU TUITION! = $26,000.00 US dollars = 2012 Shelby GT 500! Super Snake! *2.

JLF., 179647=As expected from a large university, many of the general education and prerequisite classes are anywhere in range from 100-1000. The large classes aren't difficult to succeed in as long as you're willing to work hard., 60010=My classes have been very informative. I find that some of the more general classes (maybe 400-level and lower) mostly go over information I already know. However, all my instructors have been extremely well-informed about the intricacies of their subjects. All my professors have been willing to take time to look over even my small research projects and papers; this includes instructors outside my field. The library resources are excellent, especially in Spencer Research Library. However, the library hours are rather limited (they only open at 8:00 AM!), and the restrictions on checking out audio recordings can make studying for music history tests difficult., 935725=It is what you make of it- first couple of years can be tough b/c of the large classes, however Junior/Senior year, it gets into the smaller group classes, which obviously helps with the 1:1 with professors., 188879=*1. Available: Tat Wai Chu (785) 727.9992 - Table Tennis; tailgating parties; KU SPIRIT SQUAD tryouts May 5-6; 2012. *2. Buying tickets and attending the 2012 NYC Nissan Launch NV200 Auto Expo. *3.

JLF., 408949=Apply early (by November 1st) so you can quality for multiple scholarships. They give away thousands of scholarships every year. You do not want to miss out., 187157=*1. Greek life address: 1301 Jayhawk Blvd.; room 400 Kansas Union; Lawrence, Kansas 66045; (785) 864.4861. FAX: (785) 864.4959; several of the fraternities are as follows: Interfraternity Council (IFC); Multicultural Greek Council (MGC); National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC); and the Panhellenic Associatin (PHA). *2. Eventhough the decision to go Greek is entirely up to the student it is important that the parent(s) be involved in the decision of their child by having recourse to : The University of Kansas code of Student Rights and Responsibilities; The University of Kansas Alcohol Policy; and the Anti-Hazing Policy Statements; and the Membership Recruitment Acceptance Agreement. *3. The KU Parent Association has responded to the need of parent(s) to provide insight through Sorority Parents; 03/01/12 - 06/08/12 Registration, cost per person: $150.00 US Dollars. JLF.}",

And don't bring your entire room from home with you on move in day:) Bang for the buck The amount of help offered at KU is nothing short of AMAZING!!! they offer outside learning sessions, discussion groups, learning labs, and even tutors for a more one-on-one approach. They even offer this thing called take a teacher to lunch and basically the school buys you and the Professor lunch at a restaurant downtown and you can talk to them and let them get to know you one on one or even with a friend....I haven't heard of any other University doing that!!!",
