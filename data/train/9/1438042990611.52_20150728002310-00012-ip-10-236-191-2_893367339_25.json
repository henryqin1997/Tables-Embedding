            "There are many different people at Central State and everyone has there own opinion of fun so it actually depends on what you like to do or the type of people you put yourself around.",
            "Our food has its ups and downs just like every where you go. Your not always going to have a five star meal everyday but there will be a lot of days were you will be satisfied.",
            "The dorm life at Central State is good to me depending on where you live. you are going to have your people who don't clean up after themselves but the buildings themselves are pretty nice.",
            "The class work here all in all can be easy or difficult depending on how much time you actually put in your studies. sometimes it is difficult getting up for class but that's the whole part of growing up and becoming responsible.",
            "For future students that come here always remember that peer pressure is big here so try and keep your head on straight and make sure you always do what is important before fun.",
            "Central State is a good school to attend because you learn so much from different people and their cultures. Central also provides professors that care for each and every student. since I have been here all faculty members would like to see all of their students succeed."
