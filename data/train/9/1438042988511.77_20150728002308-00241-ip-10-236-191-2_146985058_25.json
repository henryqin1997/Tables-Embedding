This is a release you should check out definitely, if you own a touch screen laptop. You can download 32 and 64 bit versions of Zorin OS 9 from\u00a0 Personally, after Zorin for a while, it feels like a rock solid distro with support for advanced hardware. It seems a very good option for users with low cost modern laptops with touch support with limited specs and running Windows 8 as the primary OS.

I have had it after it ruined my setup after a new update for the nth time so I switched to Mint. Perhaps things have changed since then but for me Zorin is certainly not up on par with Mint. Reply",
