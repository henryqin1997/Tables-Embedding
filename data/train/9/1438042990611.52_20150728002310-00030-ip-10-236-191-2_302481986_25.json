The brand hit its peak in the 1950s, when it won five out of seven races held between 1951 and 1957 and seven races overall. The most successful marque in the history of the race has been German brand Porsche with 16 victories. Other participants included Audi, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Peugeot, BMW, Bentley, Renault and Alfa Romeo., 169849=Dale Earnhardt Jr. said he has no problem with the changes in the qualifying rules, but he has a big problem with a long final segment. \"Fifty laps is forever on that track,\" Earnhardt said. \"It would be a lot more exciting for the fans and a lot more fun for us if we only did 10 laps at the end.\" #11-Denny Hamlin, who won the race as a rookie in 2006, said he agrees with Earnhardt. \"Only racing 10 laps at the end would be way better,\" Hamlin said. \"The tires go away pretty fast at Daytona, but they still would have a lot of grip for just 10 or 15 laps. We could really go all out and the racing would be a lot closer.\" ESPN.com, 299799=\"Consistency is the only thing I ask for,\" Castroneves said. \"I've been in this series since 2002 and we never had a situation like this. We always have a warning and then if you do it again, then you are going to be penalized., 250422=He became operations manager for Toyota's programs in the World Rally Championship and Le Mans 24 Hours. When the Formula 1 project was announced he assisted Ove Andersson in making the plan a reality and became General Manager F1 Operation in 2002 before stepping up to Team Manager in 2004., 326838=Wheldon signed with the team originally in June of 2002 under a testing agreement. It was later the same year, at Chicagoland, that Wheldon made his debut for Panther driving the No. 15 Pennzoil sponsored entry and finished 10th. He also started at Texas Motor Speedway for the team and finished 15th despite not even making a qualification attempt., 324185=Franchitti Returns to the IndyCar Series:\u00a0 The former Indy 500 and IndyCar Series champion will return to open-wheel racing but this time behind the wheel of the No. 10 Target Dallara Honda.\u00a0 The native of Scotland has over 180 starts under his belt between the CART and IndyCar Series resulting in 18 wins, 17 poles, 63 top-five and 95 top-10 finishes (1997-2007).\u00a0 Franchitti is the winningest driver in U.S. open-wheel history from Great Britain. He was part of the winning Rolex 24 At Daytona team this year for Ganassi and also captured the prestigious 12 Hours of Sebring in the LMP2 Class in his first ever American Le Mans Series start in 2007.\u00a0 This creates a team that will have the last two Indy 500 winners as they take the green flag next year in St. Petersburg. Right On Target:\u00a0 The team\u2019s partnership with Target continues to rank as one of the longest relationships in motorsports.\u00a0 Chip Ganassi created his own one-car IndyCar team in 1990 and established a partnership with Target. Today, their Target properties include two IRL IndyCars and along with Felix Sabates one car in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series (NSCS).\u00a0 TCGR\u2019s IndyCar program captured its second Indianapolis 500 earlier this season with current IRL points leader Scott Dixon.\u00a0 Along with teammate Dan Wheldon, the Target duo has combined to win eight of 16 races this season \u2013 second only to the Target team\u2019s CART championship run in 1998 that tallied 10 wins at the hands of former Target champions Alex Zanardi and Jimmy Vasser.

Since Newman and new teammate Tony Stewart will be leaving their current teams at the end of this year and driving next year for a new team, they both will be ineligible for the Shootout. Ironic, since the Daytona 500 this year was Stewart-versus-Newman. Adding more irony: Joey Logano, who has yet even to run a Cup race, will be in the Shootout, in Stewart's Toyota. And even more irony: David Stremme, who will likely be taking Newman's ride with Roger Penske, would be in the Shootout instead of Newman. Stremme, whose only Cup run this year was at Talladega in April, where he finished 28th, has never won a Cup event. Newman has 13 career wins. \"The new Shootout doesn't seem to be about drivers, but about manufacturers,\" Newman says. \"It's a changed race all the way around.\u00a0 Winston Salem Journal, 307058=Dutch bank ING, however, paying about $65m for its title sponsorship of the Renault team, got the most press mentions regarding F1 - in 883 separate articles - overall in 2007., 253255=As reigning double world champion at the end of 2006, the 27-year-old Spanish driver moved from Renault to McLaren and last year raced one of the most controversial tenures in the history of the sport., 292199=Takuma Sato is Japan's most successful racing driver. The 31 year old has competed in 91 Grands Prix, his best result being a third place finish in the 2004 USA Grand Prix. Taku made the switch from two wheels to four, having been a successful cycle racer in his native Japan. He first made the headlines when he won the hotly contested British Formula 3 championship in 2001, before joining the Jordan F1 team the following year. Three years with BAR Honda followed that, before he joined Super Aguri in 2006. He stayed with the team until it pulled out of the sport after this year's Spanish GP., 326481=\u201cI\u2019m very excited to be joining the entire Panther Racing crew,\u201d Wheldon said. \u201cThis is the place where I started my career in 2002 and with the personnel and leadership that John Barnes has put together, I know that we\u2019ll be fighting for outright victories, the Indianapolis 500 title and the league championship. I\u2019m looking forward to when my obligations with my current team have been honored, so I can get with the entire Panther family and start moving towards all of our goals of winning races and championships together. It\u2019s great to be back.\u201d, 317882=\"We have all recognized that solutions lie in togetherness,\" said Haug, echoing recent paddock sentiment that even the McLaren-Mercedes collaboration's notorious hostilities of the past with Ferrari are at a low ebb., 291593=\"The time has come to try and find a suitable replacement for Vettel, who is joining Red Bull Racing next year,\" explained Team Principal Franz Tost. \"The Jerez test, the last one of the season, will give us an opportunity to evaluate Buemi and Sato at the same time, as they are both possible candidates for a 2009 seat. Buemi is an obvious candidate, because not only is he already part of the Red Bull family, he is currently performing well in the GP2 series. As for Sato, he has proved worthy of a place in Formula 1 and would be a good fit with the Red Bull spirit, while his recent F1 experience would be undoubtedly valuable to our team.\", 140581=He also played down talk that Massa can rely on 'number one' treatment at least for the balance of his 2008 assault., 288541=Toyota's F1 team manager Richard Cregan is leaving the outfit to \"take an exciting new role elsewhere within motor sport,\" a statement released on Monday announced.\u00a0 The 48-year-old, who came into the sport with Toyota in 2002, will be replaced by current customer engine program manager Jens Marquardt.\u00a0 \"We are very sad to be losing a team member of Richard's qualities but we understand his reasons and we wish him the very best of luck in his new challenge,\" said team boss Tadashi Yamashina., 175968=Dominik Farnbacher set the pace in GT2 for Tafel Racing in its Ferrari F430 GT. The German, driving with Dirk Mueller, turned a lap of 1:16.679 (85.972 mph). Risi Competizione\u2019s Ferrari of Mika Salo and Jaime Melo was 0.014 seconds behind the Tafel entry. Flying Lizard Motorsports was the best of the Porsche teams with a 1:26.817 (85.836 mph) for the 911 GT3 RSR of Patrick Pilet and Johannes van Overbeek., 271584=Saturday's round eleven race was marred by controversy when Daly and Brazilian championship contenders, Fabio Orsolon and Felipe Polehtto, were all penalized for overly aggressive driving. The penalty cost Daly eight championship points (from his fourth place finish) and the championship lead. Sunday\u2019s win put Daly back on top of the championship table with two rounds to go at Virginia International Raceway, October 2nd \u2013 3rd., 310532=Matos, who has won titles in nearly every series he has raced in since moving to the U.S. in 2002, hopes to give AFS Racing/Andretti Green Racing its first series title. He claimed wins on the street course at St. Petersburg 1 and the permanent circuits at Watkins Glen International 1 and Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course 1. He's also shown speed on the ovals, earning pole positions at Homestead-Miami Speedway and Kentucky Speedway., 159521=The timing of the lawsuits, three of which were filed on or after Aug. 20, the day GM extended the employee discount to everyone, is coincidental, company spokesman Tom Wilkinson said., 317308=Despite the fact that Mercedes and BMW are the only carmakers currently involved in F1 never to have sold engines to customer teams, Haug insists that he has \"always been a supporter\" of the privateers., 162632=Norbert Haug Q: After three wins in a row for Vodafone McLaren Mercedes, the team took positions two and four in Valencia. Did you expect more? NH: Yes indeed, we wanted to win. Nevertheless, our result in Valencia is no reason for us to feel disappointed. We scored 13 points which continues the trend of the previous three races. Since Silverstone, we have scored 55 out of 72 possible points in those four races and reduced the gap to the top of the constructors' ranking from 33 to eight points.\", 156599=He championed the Viper when it was introduced in 1992, and called the possible sale \"a good thing. It's a luxury Chrysler can no longer afford. Better to sell it than watch it die,\" Lutz told The Detroit News., 274692='I got the agreement call from General Partner Timm Shinn 7:30 p.m. Saturday,' said Morton Aug. 31. 'The practice dates are set for Saturdays Nov. 15, Nov. 22 and also the Tuesday before Thanksgiving Nov. 24.' Morton said that Turkey Derby XXXV format, racing divisions and other details are to be posted on www.wallspeedway.com Sept. 7. The agreement allows a modified stock car racing tradition that Thomas and Jeannie Nicol started in 1974. Some of the best modified stock car drivers in the country have since competed against the local NASCAR Whelen All-American Series stars on the banked paved one-third mile oval.\u00a0, 160338=\"What an irony, huh?\" lawyer John Pieri said. He represents a retired autoworker in Buffalo, N.Y., who is being sued for $45,501 and accused of giving discounts to 13 people from 2004 until April 2007., 253046=Alonso his since returned to Renault and failed to secure even a podium in 2008, moving some observers to surmise that his ego was too big even for the grandeur and wealth of F1., 317514=\"But we support it and stand fully behind it,\" Haug insisted., 176380=Johnny O\u2019Connell went quickest in GT1 for Corvette Racing with a lap of 1:24.745 (87.934 mph) in the pole-winning No. 3 Corvette C6.R. O\u2019Connell, who will partner with polesitter Jan Magnussen, was 0.716 seconds ahead of Oliver Gavin and Olivier Beretta in the sister Corvette., 283904=\"Dad's Root Beer joined us right before the season began this year, and we've enjoyed the relationship we've built with the company,\" team co-owner, Robbie Buhl, said. \"We're excited to see that the folks at Dad's have seen value in their association with us, and we couldn't be happier to welcome them back for the 2009 season.\", 176863=Marcel F\u00e4ssler went quickest in LMP1 for Audi Sport North America. His time of 1:16.213 (97.779 mph) gave Audi hope after qualifying eighth and ninth Friday. F\u00e4ssler, who will drive with Emanuele Pirro, got his first significant dry time on the circuit.
