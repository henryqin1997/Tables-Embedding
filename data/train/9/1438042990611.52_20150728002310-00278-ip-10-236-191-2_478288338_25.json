Howes, \u201cvCard MIME Directory Profile\u201d, RFC 2046, September 1998) describe a text subtype for directory information suitable, for example, for encoding contact information which might appear on a business card., 446792=The basic top-level media types described in RFC 2046 include text, image, audio, video and application., 402017=The macrodot spacing is specified by the parameter s throughout this document. It has a nominal value of 143 \u03bcm, based on 9 dots printed at a pitch of 1600 dots per inch. However, it is allowed to vary by \ufffd10% according to the capabilities of the device used to produce the pattern., 520146=RSA provides a suitable public-key digital signature algorithm that decrypts the signature. RSA provides the basis for the ANSI X9.31 digital signature standard American National Standards Institute, ANSI X9.31-1998, Digital Signatures Using Reversible Public Key Cryptography for the Financial Services Industry (rDSA), Sep. 8, 1998. If no padding is used, then any public-key signature algorithm can be used., 518708=When the public-key signature is authenticated offline, the user's authentication device typically does not have access to the padding used when the signature was originally generated. The signature verification step must therefore decrypt the signature to allow the authentication device to compare the ID in the signature with the ID acquired from the tags. This precludes the use of algorithms which don't perform the signature verification step by decrypting the signature, such as the standard Digital Signature Algorithm U.S. Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), FIPS 186-2, 27 Jan. 2000., 320967=The macrodot spacing is specified by the parameter s throughout this document.

Borenstein, \u201cMultipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)\u2014Part Two: Media Types\u201d, RFC 2046, November 1996) and related RFCs. The MIME data consists of a header followed by a body. The header is encoded as a variable-length text string preceded by an 8-bit string length. The body is encoded as a variable-length type-specific octet stream preceded by a 16-bit size in big-endian format.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Hyperlabels therefore make it possible for the pharmaceutical industry to extend the use of product labels and packaging to increase brand strength, and to establish closer links with customers. Thus, with Hyperlabels, the customer can become an integral part of the product supply chain, and supply chain data can be integrated with customer relationship management (CRM) or healthcare databases to improve the overall efficiency and level of service offered to customers. Using a Netpage pen to interact with the label, customers can be offered additional information on drug use, risks and advice on potential interactions between drugs. It could also provide an opportunity for customers to register for participation in new drug trials, to enter promotions, to participate in Web chat sessions, or to receive \u2018free\u2019 samples. Web pages can be customised based on customer profiles, local area health data, or by using a range of product supply chain data such as geographic location. When digital pen use becomes widespread, product graphics can be added to labels to indicate interactive areas and prompting customers to write or click using a Netpage pen. A digital Netpage pen can identify the x-y position on a label, and enable a link to be established between the information on the label, and a Web page on a server. The Netpage pen connects the customer to an Internet-based Hyperlabel Server through a companion device such as a mobile",
