Effective January 2009, Form 941-X, 943X, 944X, 945X, CT1X was introduced to replace Form 941-C. Form 941-C is now obsolete. The new Form(s) were developed to simplify the correction process for the tax payer and will better identify the changes being made for the tax examiner. A Form 941-X is not always necessary to correct the CAWR related case. Missing Forms W-2/W-2C may be needed to balance the case and ensure the taxpayer's employees received their earnings credits with SSA., 156573=The IRS-CAWR program compares the employer's data provided to the IRS on Forms 941, 943, 944, 945 or Schedule H to the data provided to SSA on Forms W-2/W-2C and/or to the IRS on Forms 1099-R and W-2G., 69554=If the taxpayer responds and only provides the SSN used for the Schedule H, research CC IMFOL to obtain the X-Ref TIN/EIN.

United States, an opinion was issued regarding whether payments made pursuant to reduction in force programs are considered wages for purposes of FICA taxes and compensation for purposes of RRTA taxes. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concluded that employment taxes apply to all payments at issue. See 518 F.3d 1328 (Fed Circuit 2008). These types of claims should be disallowed. See IRM 21.7.2.5.16CSX Claims and IRM 21.5.3.4.7.3.1Types of Protective Claims, for additional information., 128723=Research IDRS using all tools available to determine if the correct withholding has been reported on the original Form 1040 or if an amended Form 1040 was filed to correct the withholding., 147947=TY 2013 IRS-CAWR and TY 2012 SSA-CAWR programs processing benchmark dates are listed on the chart below., 7130=Send the Form(s) 941-X to the following address: Internal Revenue Service SBSE Compliance Services Mail Stop 4160 1973 N.

For example, if you are working a late reply for TY 2007 IRS-CAWR and the current \"X\" represents the tax years on CAP (TY 2010, TY 2009, and TY 2008), use 18480 to report the time for the TY 2006 case. For IRS-CAWR and SSA-CAWR programs, tax examiners use:, 37644=For cases showing a debit and credit on the CAP money fields see Exhibit 4.19.4-4. If a Form 1040, U. S. Individual Income Tax Return, with a Schedule H was filed by the taxpayer, the MFT & ADJ Screen will have the corresponding MFT 30 and SSN information. Instructions for working the Schedule H are included in IRM 4.19.4.2.7., 209932=If the DLN is IDRS generated, this date will increment by 400, so January 15 would be shown as 415., 177472=Once the CAWR Unit assesses additional tax under the CAWR program, no interest free adjustment of such tax can be made by filing Form 941-X or by signing Form 2504 agreeing to the proposed deficiency., 6669=Send Letter 86C to inform the taxpayer their claim(s) are being rerouted and suspended.

See IRM 21.7.2.5.20.1. for more information., 107274=The failure to deposit (FTD) penalty may be assessed whether or not the adjustment is interest free. Tiered penalty assessments for CAWR apply only to Forms 941, 943, 944, and 945.

Then follow the procedures below:, 118553=If a 6020(b) return is present and past due (it has been 5 months or more), and a Failure to File penalty is restricted on the module, increase the penalty by 25% of the TC 290. For returns due after July 30, 1996 (without regard to extensions), IRC Section 6651(g) provides that a 6020(b) return is treated the same as a return filed by a taxpayer for purposes of the Failure to Pay penalty.
