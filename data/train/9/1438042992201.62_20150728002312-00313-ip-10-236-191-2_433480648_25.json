They should NOT be used to determine local water systems compliance with drinking water standards, nor should they be used to make personal judgements about individual health risks. Units: Sample measurements are taken in micrograms per Liter (ug/L) and are regulated in milligrams per Liter (mg/L). A microgram per Liter is equivalent to one contaminant part per billion (ppb). A ppb can be thought of as one grain of salt in a swimming pool. Data for Total Trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids 5, and bromate are presented in ppb. 1 mg/L = 1000 ug/L, or 0.080 mg/L = 80 ug/L = 80 ppb, which happens to be the TTHM standard in the Stage 1 DBP Rule. Calculation in Regulations is Different: Comparisons with compliance calculations based on the existing Total Trihalomethanes standard in CFR Part 141.30 may not be warranted since the standard i s based on an annual average of public water system quarterly averages and not on treatment plant results as shown here. Also the results here are based on different types of samples. Results of Zero: A result of zero may indicate that a sample",
