            "This school is great for people who belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I loved being able to incorporate my spiritual learning with my every day education. But I would also recommend this to anyone who wants to learn, meet some amazing new people, and receive the kind of education that can't be found anywhere else!",
            "Procrastination is very VERY bad! Get your homework done and your studying in and you'll do great. But also, don't be afraid to have fun! There's so much to do each week and a lot of incredible people to be with.",
            "BYU-I is really cheap when it comes to paying for tuition, but in no way is it cheap in what it provides in your education.",
            "I love being on campus! Not only is it easy to get around, the classes structured and welcoming, but the people are amazing, the gardens are beautiful, and the activities provided are things I wouldn't want to miss. There are so many opportunities here, each one ready to show how exceptional you can be!",
            "The teachers here are incredible and I feel privileged to be learning from them. Each class has an atmosphere that is close-knit and personal, comfortable and easy to fit into, challenging but not so much that you get frustrated. All of the teachers I've had so far have been so great at helping me to understand their subjects and to have the desire to learn them. I wouldn't trade this kind of learning, with so much to look forward to, for anything."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{360838=there is a brand new dining area that was completed in 2010 that has great food that doesn't cost too much. it is very open and social and also includes a stage, piano etc.., 284859=the education here is way worth the $1700 a semester., 50591=byu-idaho has all the top notch benefits of a 4-year university, however, the price for tution maxes at 1735$ while apartments go for 1035 for one semester!, 116811=VERY economical. LDS tuition only about 1500 a semester and 3000 for non LDS. Defiantly worth every penny. They also offer free tutoring!, 868498=BYU-Idaho provides a terrific education for the money. It's about 1800 a semester, and they usually keep textbook costs down as well. And, if you get a 4.0 during your first year, you automatically receive a scholarship for a full year's worth of tuition, which can be renewed each year after., 165275=As September nears I wait in anticipation for this great experience.Idaho, here I come!!!, 253272=tuition is $1700 per semester. it is the best value college out there., 1081602=Totally worth it. You spend around 3,000 per semester. Tuition is around 1800, room and board is around 1000; dorms and most apartments cost this price, if you are looking at a fancier apartment it can range between 1200-1500 per semester. anyway it is TOTALLY worth it., 858317=BYU-I is subsidized by money from the LDS church, which makes tuition incredibly affordable in comparison to other universities. It's currently around $3000 per semester for those who aren't members of the LDS church, and those who are members have to pay around $2000. Great professors and student body, it's a wonderful place to learn(I swear I'm not being paid by the school to write this. I just love it here.)., 47048=A great university that offers great pricing. I pay about 2000 dollars a semester for tuition. That doesnt include housing rate and college fees but overall it is the best around in regards to bang for the buck., 827640=Tuition is actually the cheapest that I have found. It is about 2000 dollars a semester and apartments cost about 1000 dollars a semester., 639146=BYU Idaho is one of the least expensive private schools in the US. Where else can you spend less than $2000 for tuition AND books a semester? I think the education is great! I think the classes are good and I have always learned a lot., 1027217=Definitely worth the money. Unless you are a D student you will get a scholarship, even if it is just $250 per semester. The bookstore, despite what some say does offer competitive pricing on books. Tuition is less that $1800 per semester and you can take as many as 21 credits, which I would recommend against. While some argue its not as good academically as Provo, it's no worse that any state college I ever went to and they are adding new programs every year., 171073=It is possible to save money while being at BYU-Idaho! The tuition is about $1600 to be a full-time student from out of state, and the off campus housing is between $875-$1100 for 4 months with utilities and cable included. Books are super cheap if you rent them and the food is reasonably priced., 166900=Bring WARM clothes, even in March it still snows and is cold, 470036=Every September there is a Temple-to-Temple relay where teams of 2-8 people run 37 miles total from the Rexburg Id. Temple to the Idaho Falls, Id. Temple. The cost is between $10 and $17 (depending on when you register) and includes snacks and a nice sports T-shirt. The sand dunes are a great place for camping, roasting hot dogs and marshmallows, or just having fun. They are about 15 miles out of town, but worth going to again and again., 393426=Every sunday at 9:00PM people will gather under the stadium and sing hymns for half an hour. It's pretty fun if you get a good group going! as for locations, There is a beautiful set of gardens nestled between the Ricks and Benson buildings. definitely check them out., 80473=every student has to sign a code of conduct before attending, saying you will uphold the standards of the church and not cheat, lie, steal, etcetera. this is a church school, so every tuesday the campus shuts down at 1:50 until 3:00 and all the students gather in the i-center to listen to a speaker who discusses some principle of the gospel. they are selected by a committee of students, supervised by the president of the college. also, this school has a testing center. you go to this room in the student center and you take your test there., 260178=i haven't ventured out since 2001 in that department., 254323=campus dining, called the crossroads is located in the center of campus. the food is delicious and has a wide variety of choices. the crossroads is open monday through saturday: 11:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. the prices are more expensive than cooking in your apartment and average $7/meal., 650836=With tuition around $1700 and rent between $400 - $700 a month you can't ask for a better price for your education., 572830=DANCE PARTIES! There are tons of dance parties around the area where you get to dress up crazy and go have a blast with your friends. There is also good hiking, and a waterfall called Monkey Rock close by that are fun to go to. Campus has tons of activities that go on all the time. For example, Spring Semester 2012, they had Bill Cosby do a comedy show. There are lots of fun things to do in little Rexburg, Idaho! They just leave room for you to be creative. :), 945317=I suggest taking at least one course from brother Ross Barron. He is by far the best professor there. His classes are tough and very educational. There is never a dull moment. I also suggest not taking a class by Brother Hammar. He is a sweet old man- but he is forgetful and asks way too much for the credits his class is worth.}",
