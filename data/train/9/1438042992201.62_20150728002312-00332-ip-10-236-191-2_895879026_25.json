Harambee is usually a Kenyan tradition where many people of the community gather promoting different self help events, dances, and even selling great valuable items. At Benedict we do just that inviting people from communities all over to bring in what they know and share it with us. Girls Scouts, The Double Dutch Team, and many people selling different Afro-Centric paintings, shirts and other things. Foods and dances as well. As a Benedict College family we focus on keeping our traditions alive we love Harambee., 37731=Dorms are old, and not up to date. During the Fall semester it's really cold in the dorms until November when they turn the heat on. Freshmen have a midnight curfew unless your 21 or over. The bathrooms get cleaned every morning except the weekends., 109656=The freshman dormitories are terrible. Mather which is the freshman dorm is overpopulated. It has twelve floors and it is the biggest building on campus. You are not allowed microwaves or any appliance in the dorms. There is two microwaves on the twelve floor for all of Mather to use. The microwave is open until midnight Sunday through Thursday. Friday and Saturday the room is open all day. You have a 12 o'clock curfew if you break the curfew you have to pay a $25 fine. There is absolutely no coed visitation., 103977=Our current cafeteria is under going some construction right now and is expanding, so we in dine in the ball room area of our swinton center, where the cafeteria is located. The construction should be done by January and will be beautiful upon its completion.}",

Yes it is very different from high school, that is the mature thing about it. you are by yourself now, so be adult now. Bang for the buck It cost alot to go here, but the school gives out plenty of money to help finance your ability to attend.

Am learning a lot Yes, Benedict College you do learn alot in your major. The teachers will give you research projects and writing papers to become more familiar with you studies.
