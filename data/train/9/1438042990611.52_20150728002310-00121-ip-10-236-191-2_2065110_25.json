All four other assistant coaches except for Gary Mumford either moved schools or stepped down, leaving almost the entire coaching staff to be revamped. Then, midway through the 2013 season, Loney was offered an administration job in nearby McKinney ISD, leaving Mumford the new head coach. Despite the changes in leadership and having only two returners, Liberty went on to have its second most successful year to date (as per overall state rank), placing sixth overall at Medium School State with 42,089.3 points (without SuperQuiz). Scores over 8,000 were earned by Honors Sebastian Garza and also by Vik Shirvaikar, who placed fifth overall in the Honors division with a score of 8,557.9 as a sophomore. Vik's score was the third highest ever achieved by a Liberty Decathlete and also broke Liberty's record for the highest total objectives score., 11920=In 2008, four of the highest-scoring Decathletes from the previous year joined with five newcomers to take second place at Small School State once again, this time with 43,629.1 points. Five Decathletes placed in the top five of their respective brackets, three of whom scoring over eight thousand points: Honors Nancy Yuan and Michael Perusse as well as Scholastic David Han, whose performance earned him the current record overall score for a Liberty Scholastic. Nancy Yuan's score of 8,660.3 remained the highest score in the history of Liberty Academic Decathlon for six years., 78086=At the end of the 2013 season, only three members were not graduating: Honors Vik Shirvaikar and Abel Sen as well as Scholastic Nick Murira. However, Murira likely would become an Honors the next year, and he decided not to participate, leaving the team to have two returners., 38566=In 2008, four of the highest-scoring Decathletes from the previous year joined with five newcomers to take second place at Small School State once again, this time with 43,629.1 points. Five Decathletes placed in the top five of their respective brackets, three of whom scoring over eight thousand points: Honors Nancy Yuan and Michael Perusse as well as Scholastic David Han, whose performance earned him the current record overall score for a Liberty Scholastic. Nancy Yuan's score of 8,660.3 remains the highest score ever recorded in the history of Liberty Academic Decathlon., 12516=The next year, the tight-knit team had eight returners and was ready for an even better performance at State than ever before. Despite nervousness about having been upgraded a size, the team went on to win first place at Medium School State with a score of 46,067.1, with a Decathlete from each bracket placing in the top five and all three Honors scoring over 8,000 points. Due to the school's astounding success in the third year of its existence, head coach Derek McDowell won Coach of the Year award in 2010. The team was also recognized, albeit unofficially, for having three members with the last name Yuan, only two of whom (Varsities Jonathan and Rachel) related. However, as two schools at Large School State scored higher, the team did not advance to Nationals., 69533=At the end of the 2012 season, longtime head coach Derek McDowell was promoted to the position of the district head high school science coordinator and handed head coaching duties to Gary Loney. All four other assistant coaches except for Gary Mumford either moved schools or stepped down, leaving almost the entire coaching staff to be revamped. Then, midway through the 2013 season, Loney was offered an administration job in nearby McKinney ISD, leaving Mumford the new head coach., 45056=In the team's third year, the tight-knit team had eight returners and was ready for an even better performance at State than ever before. Despite nervousness about having been upgraded a size, the team went on to win first place at Medium School State with a score of 46,067.1, with a Decathlete from each bracket placing in the top five and all three Honors scoring over 8,000 points.

The team was also recognized, albeit unofficially, for having three members with the last name Yuan, only two of whom (Varsities Jonathan and Rachel) related. However, as two schools at Large School State scored higher, the team did not advance to Nationals., 15988=The team is looking forward to continuing their success in the 2015 competition year., 15382=Though six members of the 2013 team graduated, Liberty came back the next year to get their second-highest-ever Regionals score with 40,891.8 points. Honors Abel Sen and Vik Shirvaikar set new Regionals individual records with their scores of 8,607.2 and 8,582.4, respectively. At State, they increased to 42,683.7 points, sixth in Medium Schools and sixteenth in the state. Vik shattered the previous Liberty high score by over 300 points with his score of 8,966.4, and Abel notably earned a perfect score on the Economics test, beating out every other person in the state by eighty points., 11425=In the 2007 season, the team's first year of competition, they impressively managed to place second in Small School State competition with 37,522.7 points despite being composed solely of freshmen and sophomores. Nancy Yuan took first place in the Honors division with the school's first score over 8,000 points, fourth in the entire state regardless of size. Scholastic David Han also took first place in his bracket, and two other Decathletes placed in the top five individuals., 101942=(*) 2013 Varsity Khagu Patel only competed in subjectives at Regional competition, so his score was out of three events. (**) 2015 Honors Shanee Lu only competed in Saturday's events at Regional competition, so her score is out of six events (objectives minus the Literature test)., 102562=Updated as of 2014. Note that in 2007 and 2008, Liberty participated in Small School competition, and beginning in 2009 moved up to Medium Schools., 85081=A major contender for the team was Brandon Baker (12, V) . Other contenders were Sabrina Peng (10, H), Eileen Bau (10, H), Ashley Huang (10, H), Yujun Chow (9, H), Harris Qureshi (10, H), Prashanth Kotla (9, H), Tahir Khan (9, H), Grace Jeong (11, H), Jane Zhang (9, H), Arushii Nadar (11, H), Derrick Ogola (11, H), Aaron Jabir (11, S), Weiming Hu (10, S), Aish Vemula (10, S), Zac Istas (11, V), Adil Awwal (11, V), and Olivia Nese (9, V)., 57138=2011 was a major rebuilding year for Liberty, with everyone who'd ever shown interest in the team gone but for returning Varsity Andrew Wouters (Mark Yang, Pratik Bhosale, and Max Brown all moved, while Chris Skrodzki did not participate). Notable additions to the team include the future Region IX champions Yueheng \"Henry\" Zhang (Honors 2012) and Kovan Barzani (Scholastic 2013). A particular highlight was Varsity Charles Meek who nearly hit 7k at State. Despite great potential, overall scores had fallen from those of the past, and 2011 was known as \"the Great Depression of Liberty AcDec.\" It nevertheless set up a foundation for a return to success the next year., 190749=Updated as of 2015. Please note when considering medals that Liberty competed as a Small School in 2007 and 2008., 10791=Liberty High School is the third of six high schools in Frisco ISD, a district well-known for its solid Academic Decathlon teams. In 2006, the rapid growth of the city led to the emergency opening of Liberty High School in the new building that was originally meant to be Fowler Middle School. That year, Liberty welcomed many freshmen and sophomores who would previously have attended Centennial High School. By the start of the next school year in 2007, Liberty's intended building was finished, and the previous year's Academic Decathlon team was ready to prepare for a great performance at that year's competitions., 13760=After an admittedly poor showing (by Liberty's standards) at 2011 Medium School State, placing eleventh with 39,327.2 points and a single returner, the 2012 season fared much better. Despite not finding two of the team's varsities until a mere two weeks before Regionals competition, they, four returners, and two other newcomers placed sixth at Medium School State with 41,404.9 points. Honors John Yan and Henry Zhang both put in the first State scores of over 8,000 since 2009, with John's 8,493.7 behind only Nancy Yuan's 2008 and 2009 scores., 79763=At State, the team further improved their score with Vik Shirvaikar notably setting the highest score in Liberty AcDec history, shattering Nancy Yuan's 2009 record by over 300 points with his 8,966.4, earning him second overall in the competition. Also notably, sophomore Honors Abel Sen achieved a perfect score on the Economics test, outscoring every other person in the state by 80 points., 3680=Liberty High School, located in Frisco, Texas, is a Medium-size school whose Academic Decathlon team has seen success since the school first opened its doors in Fall 2006. The team notably won Medium School State in 2009, third in all of Texas, and has continued fielding strong teams since., 70032=The 2013 season saw a very large number of underclassmen try out for positions on the team, a phenomenon often attributed to the fact that the Academic Decathlon class began to give grades on a weighted GPA scale. Though the numerous freshmen were at a disadvantage due to not having studied over the summer, one Honors rose through the ranks like a Dark Horse candidate: Abel Sen, who eventually narrowly beat out returner Sarah Wang (11) for the third spot on the team and who became the highest-scoring freshman in Liberty history. New to Decathlon after having participated in Octathlon the previous year, sophomore Honors Vik Shirvaikar became the top-scoring student at practices, and two-year Honors contender Sebastian Garza (12) also won a spot on the team., 63310=2012 was a return to success for Liberty AcDec. In the Honors division, 2011 top team scorer Yueheng \"Henry\" Zhang returned with two new students; in the Scholastic division, returning Kovan Barzani joined with newcomer Sonakshee Shree and 2010 Scholastic Pratik Bhosale, who had moved back to the school after an absence in 2011. Despite not recruiting Varsity Moez Janmohammad until a just a month before Regionals competition, and switching out an ineligible Sadat Ahmed (12) for Chris Hong two weeks later, the team placed ninth at Medium School State with 41,404.9 points. Honors John Yan and Yueheng Zhang both also scored over 8,000 for the first time since 2009, with John's 8,493.7 behind only Nancy Yuan's 2008 and 2009 scores., 78377=As the year progressed, both Shirvaikar (11) and Sen (10) became definite picks for the team, and a competition between many of 2013's freshman Honors tryouts for the final Honors spot was won by Shanee Lu (10). In the Scholastic division, a large new crop of interested participants yielded Abhay Rangray (11), and 2013 Scholastic tryout Larry Yin (10) also landed a spot on the team. Then, surprisingly, in mid-November, Murira (11) found out he would in fact still be a Scholastic and decided to make up for not having counted the previous year. His last-minute participation and newfound dedication earned him the final Scholastic spot., 249219=Updated as of 2015., 77229=Major contenders for the team were Sarah Wang (11, H), Bahar Sahami (11, H), and Eileen Bau (9, H). Other contenders were Shanee Lu (9, H), Sindhu Senthilkumar (10, H), Trac Nguyen (9, H), Harris Qureshi (9, H), Sabrina Peng (9, H), Thomas Sipp (9, H), Ganesh Avula (9, H), Cindy Jiang (11, H), Alvin Qin (9, S), Larry Yin (9, S), Grace Caputo (11, S), George Zeng (9, S), and Neel Raguboopathi (10, V).}",
