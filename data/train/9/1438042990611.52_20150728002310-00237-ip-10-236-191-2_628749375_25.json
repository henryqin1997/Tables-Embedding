Boycotts of BP gas stations popped up all across the country as frustration grew over the company\u2019s failed efforts to stop the massive leak. The gushing well wasn\u2019t their only problem, as their public relations efforts continued to make the situation worse according to many. First, they delayed responding at all, allowing the fake and humorous BPGlobalPR Twitter feed to dominate the conversation by relaying the angst of the public. Furthermore, when BP did issue public statements they lacked a show of human compassion, said most public relations experts. President Barack Obama voiced that the money spent on their multi-million dollar national TV spot should have gone to cleanup and compensating devastated fisherman and small business owners. In every company\u2019s history there are public relations crises like this, which is why Public Relations Coordinators exist. A PR Coordinator is in charge of crafting a company\u2019s story to help portray it in a positive light across the media to potential customers every day.}",
