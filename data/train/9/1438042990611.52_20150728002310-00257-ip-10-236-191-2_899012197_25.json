            "The food there is alright, its not a meal in a box type dinner. they cook things like steak and actually dinner.",
            "Dorm life is fun, living on campus is the best way to meet people. As a frshman the dorms are in ok shape. They feel a little small, but as you are there longer you get to choose town houses which are very nice.",
            "They are very strict when it comes to drinking and smoking. Siena is a smoking free campus which went in effect 2 years ago. Siena cares for the academics and works hard to keep it that way.",
            "This school is worth going to because you learn alot of what your major is intended for. Only in the first 2 years do you take a decent amount of electives. They work on your highs and lows within the degree to help better you for when you leave.",
            "Siena is a decent size college with a beautiful campus. The students are very nice,except if your a commuter then you will have to try to make alot of friends. Teachers are nice for the most part and care for the students."

If you want a home away from home, Siena is for you. Tips for prospective students If you can apply early, don't hesitate. I did the early action application and was the accepted in November of my senior year. Bang for the buck Most students at Siena receive some type of financial aid. It is definitely not a cheap school, but for the education you are getting, it is worth it. Siena makes paying for college on my own possible through scholarships and financial aid. Am enjoying being here Siena is a beautiful campus. It's small; making the walk from one building to another across campus under ten minutes. The students are all trying to get",
