Starting with Windows 2008 the tool is already installed., 742012=On 64-bit Windows versions, the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) must be installed before the installation of the AD connector., 1090746=This field contains a list of time periods. If there should be no period defined for a weekday, this weekday field should be left empty. The entry of the period always requires two-figure hour and minute entries separated by a colon. Start and end points are separated by a hyphen. If several periods are to be defined for one weekday, these can be entered in the text field separated by a comma. A whole day is represented by the period 00:00-24:00, e.g., 08:00-12:00,12:45-17:00., 704989=In both modes, the Active Directory Connection service is used in UCS (UCS AD Connector for short), which can synchronise the directory service objects between a Windows 2003/2008/2012 server with Active Directory (AD) and the OpenLDAP directory of Univention Corporate Server., 1089331=This object defines a period starting on Monday at 0:00 and ending on Sunday at 24:00 without any interruptions., 648794=In Microsoft Active Directory, the SYSVOL share is synchronised by the File Replication Service (introduced with Windows 2000) or the Distributed File System (as of Windows 2008 R2). These replication methods are not yet fully implemented in Samba 4. The synchronisation between the Samba 4 domain controllers is performed in UCS via a Cron job (every five minutes as standard - can be configured using the Univention Configuration Registry variable samba4/sysvol/sync/cron)., 733994=Figure\u00a09.9.\u00a0Exporting the root certificate on Windows 2008, 759816=If a global group A is accepted as a member of another global group B in Univention Directory Manager, this membership does not appear in Active Directory because of the internal AD limitations in Windows 2000/2003. If group A's name is then changed, the group membership to group B will be lost. Since Windows 2008 this limitation no longer exists and thus global groups can also be nested in Active Directory., 172880=The procedure for joining a Windows system to a UCS domain made available via Samba is now described for Windows 7/8, Windows 2012 and Windows XP Professional. The process is similar for other Windows versions. In addition to the client versions, Windows server systems can also join the domain. Windows servers join the domain as member servers; joining a Windows systems as a domain controller is not supported., 476319=The group ID may consist of integers between 1000 and 59999 and between 65536 and 100000., 1089692=The opposite to the Nagios period WorkHours, this period covers the time from midnight to 8 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to midnight from Monday to Friday respectively and from 0:00 to 24:00 on Saturday and Sunday., 238505=On UCS systems, a Cron job verifies the validity of the local computer certificate and the root certificate daily and records the expiry date in the Univention Configuration Registry variables ssl/validity/host (host certificate) and ssl/validity/root (root certificate). The values entered there reflect the number of days since the 1/1/1970., 885698=As standard, the proxy server can only be accessed from local networks. If, for example, a network interface with the address 192.168.1.10 and the network mask 255.255.255.0 is available on the computer on which Squid is installed, only computers from the network 192.168.1.0/24 can access the proxy server. Additional networks can be specified via the Univention Configuration Registry variable squid/allowfrom. When doing so, the CIDR notation must be used; several networks should be separated by blank spaces., 868912=The NetBIOS over TCP/IP scope for the client according to the specification in RFC1001 and RFC1002. Attention must be paid to uppercase and lowercase when entering the NetBIOS scope., 743051=During a standard installation in Windows 2008 the Windows firewall blocks the access to the UCS AD Connector. This must either be deactivated in System settings or Port 6670/TCP authorised., 760809=Users are synchronised like groups using the user name or using the AD pre-Windows 2000 name. The First name, Last name, Primary group (in so far as present on the other side), Organisation, Description, Street, City, Postal code, Windows home path, Windows login script, Disabled and Account expiry date attributes are transferred. Indirectly Password, Password expiry date and Change password on next login are also synchronised. Primary e-mail address and Telephone number are prepared but commented out due to differing syntax in the mapping configuration., 176755=When using Windows 8 to a domain based on Samba 3, certain settings must be made in the Windows registry before joining the domain. A corresponding REG file can be downloaded from http://sdb.univention.de/1102. The system must then be restarted. This step is not necessary with Samba 4., 756645=The Pre-Windows 2000 name (LDAP attribute samAccountName) is used in AD, which means that a group in Active Directory can appear under a different name from in UCS., 941700=This reference will be displayed on every client capable of MSDFS (e.g. Windows 2000 and XP) as a regular directory., 476951=The RIDs below 1000 are reserved for standard groups and other special objects., 723914=Internet Explorer 6 - which is preinstalled on Windows 2003 systems - is not supported by Univention Management Console. The browser must be updated before continuing., 121093=The conversion to a GPT can affect other installed operating systems, especially if they or their bootloaders do not support GPT (e.g., Windows 2000, the 32-bit versions of Window XP or older Linux versions)., 858160=The MAC address of the network card needs to be entered here, e.g., 2e:44:56:3f:12:32 or 2e-44-56-3f-12-32., 178826=When using Windows 7 to a domain based on Samba 3, certain settings must be made in the Windows registry before joining the domain. A corresponding REG file can be downloaded from http://sdb.univention.de/1102. The system must then be restarted. This step is not necessary with Samba 4.}",
