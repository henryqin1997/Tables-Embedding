            "southern oregon university is small, and the location is beautiful and priceless. the general education standards are lower than other schools i have attended, and many students here do not care too much about their intelligence. however, the size and location makes it a great place to explore and to make valuable connections."

Spring and fall are especially nice. Downtown and Lithia Park are charming, and there are some great hiking spots. Keep in mind, Ashland is a tourist destination (for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival), not a typical college town. February thru November is the Shakespeare season, so there are almost always plays to see., 261764=I am a non-traditional student and live off campus. I have not been inside any of the dorms. Other students seem to really enjoy the dorms and tell of a great camaraderie that develops over the term. The new dorms should be done being built this fall, 2013. They look wonderful., 270738=Southern Oregon is such a great school. The campus is beautiful and the students and staff are polite and friendly. I am excited to be attending this September.}",

Whether you're a sports nut, brainiac, theater kid, band president or just the average Joe, you'll find something to love at SOU. Tips for prospective students Apply and take a few trips down to Ashland. You'll fall in love not only with the campus, but with the whole town. There's so many exciting things in Ashland. The food is great too! Bang for the buck At first glance, the costs might seem a bit too heavy. But the school is so helpful when it comes to applying for aid and scholarships. Not only do they help you figure out how to get money, they show you how to use it and pay it back. Am enjoying being here",
