First, their methodology is a de facto classification based on actual data on exchange rates and international reserves. This has an advantage over the de jure classification from the IMF's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, because actual exchange rate regimes often differ from officially announced regimes (Reinhart and Rogoff (2004), Shambaugh (2004), and Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2005)). Second, Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2005)'s classification is available for all our countries except Taiwan and is available for almost our entire sample period. In contrast, Reinhart and Rogoff's classification ends in 2001. Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger create a discrete variable equal to one for a fully floating regime, equal to two for a limited-flexibility or a managed float regime, and equal to three for a fixed or currency board regime. As a robustness check for our results, we use both Shambaugh's and Reinhart and Rogoff's classifications for the available sample period. The results are qualitatively the same., 71016=Bartov, E., and Bodnar, G., 1994, Firm Valuation, Earnings Expectations, and the Exchange-rate Exposure Effect, Journal of Finance, 44, 1755-1786., 75141=Jensen, Gerald R., Jeffrey M.

Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2004) analyze the daily response of the 500 individual firms comprising the S&P 500 in early 2003 and find that firms that are financially constrained respond more to monetary policy surprises. Bernanke and Kuttner (2005) analyze the daily response of the CRSP value-weighted index and Fama-French industry portfolios. They find that U.S. monetary policy surprises affect U.S. equity markets mainly through their effects on expected future risk premiums and expected future cash flows. Wongswan (2005) studies the impact FOMC announcement surprises have on 15 equity indexes from different countries, while Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2006) analyzes 50 different countries. They both find that the exchange rate regime of the country and financial development are important determinants of the cross-country variation in the response., 23314=There are two main advantages of analyzing firms that list their shares in U.S. markets. First, the majority of the FOMC announcements in our study occur at 2:15 pm ET when Asian and European stock markets are closed, while U.S. stock exchanges are open so that prices of cross-listed firms allow us to capture the high frequency foreign equity response contemporaneously to that of their U.S. counterparts. Second, they allow us to capture the firm-level response as opposed to the aggregate index response. However, since our sample of foreign firms are large relative to the average local firm, and for the most part have access to and use U.S. credit, one may worry that our sample is biased towards foreign firms that react more to U.S. shocks than the average foreign firm.9, 54625=First, as in Table 7 the signs of many of our coefficient estimates are consistent with the credit channel theories; more financially constrained firms are more sensitive to target rate surprises, even after controlling for industry fixed-effects, suggesting that the credit channel still plays an important role over and above the traditional monetary policy transmission channel. For example, we find that the more a firm must finance investment from sources other than its own cash flow (more External Finance Dependence), the more sensitive it is to a target surprise. On the other hand, a firm that pays high dividends or has an investment-grade bond rating has a relatively muted response to U.S. interest rates. In addition, a firm that is less opaque (more Analyst Coverage) response less to target surprises. We also find that responses vary over time. In particular, in relatively stressful periods, as indicated by the level of the junk bond spread, the stock price of a typical firm is more sensitive to a monetary shock. Firms also appear to react less to monetary policy surprises over time. This result coincides with the increased transparency of Fed communications over time, but it also coincides with very low volatility in the financial market (which is captured by our junk bond spread, but perhaps not perfectly). Finally, controlling for asymmetric information and the firm's exposure to other frictions that prevent it from funding all desired investments, large firms react more strongly to federal funds target rate surprises than small firms. Foreshadowing some of the subsequent results, in part this is due to the fact that large firms' systemic risk has changed over time (Schwert, 2003, and Guo, 2002). A little later we consider the possibility that the cross-firm variation in the response is mainly explained by the firm's CAPM beta, but first we turn to potential channels of transmission that are specific to foreign firms in our sample - portfolio balance effects and transmission of U.S. rate shocks through spillovers to local interest rates., 80125=Wongswan, Jon, 2006, Transmission of Information across International Equity Markets, Review of Financial Studies, 19, 1157-1189., 74744=Hong, H., T.

Within five minutes of the announcement the S&P 500 index moved up 1.5 percent, and it showed a cumulative gain of 1.9 percent after one hour. Strikingly, foreign equity prices, represented by the MSCI Europe and Far East Index, rose slightly more than U.S. equity prices (the cumulative gain was 2.03 percent). This pattern has been typical in our sample period. On average, we find that the foreign firms' reaction is 5 to 10 basis points higher than that of U.S. firms. Our study can at least provide a partial explanation to this apparent puzzle. The credit channel cannot explain the difference in the response, because our foreign firm sample is comprised of financially healthier firms than our U.S. sample. The demand-channel and the foreign interest rate channel, on the other hand, provide an explanation. First, our sample of foreign firms produces more cyclically sensitive goods than the sample of U.S. firms. In fact, once we control for industry fixed effects, we find that foreign firms on average react similarly or 6 basis points less to FOMC announcements than U.S. firms for a 25-basis-point surprise change in the target rate. Second, many of our firms are based in countries either where their home currencies are pegged to the U.S. dollar, or where local interest rates move closely to U.S. rates., 3552=What are the global shocks that drive the cross-country correlation of stock returns? This question, central to many topics in international finance, is deeply associated with another fundamental question: What are the transmission channels through which these shocks dissipate? Previous literature has documented that U.S. monetary policy is one such global shock (Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2006) and Wongswan (2006 and 2005)), and in this paper we aim to answer the latter question. Specifically, we examine the following four channels of monetary policy transmission: the demand channel, the credit channel, the portfolio channel, and the foreign interest rate channel.

The MSCI global index started trading in the American Stock Exchange on August 17, 2001, so this comparison is constrained to the sample period from August 17, 2001 to December 31, 2006, which includes 44 FOMC announcements and no intermeeting moves. A 25-basis-point target rate surprise tightening decreases the MSCI global index by 0.88 percent compared to our panel-data estimate of 0.93 percent, and the coefficient estimates are not statistically different from each other (the of the likelihood ratio testing that the two coefficients in a seemingly unrelated system of equations estimation are equal to each other is 0.16 with a p-value equal to 0.68). We thus conclude that our average effect estimate is equivalent to a value-weighted global response., 78299=Piazzesi, Monika, and Swanson, Eric, 2008, Futures Prices as Risk-adjusted Forecasts of Monetary Policy, Journal of Monetary Economics, forthcoming., 73152=Fama, E. and French, K., 2001, Disappearing dividends: changing firm characteristics or lower propensity to pay?

We also examine the following popular proxies for the financial health of the firm: debt to market capital share, dividend payout policy, and Standard and Poor's long term credit rating of the firm.14 All else equal, we expect firms that are more financially constraint to be more sensitive to federal funds rate surprises., 77094=Kodres, Laura E., and Matthew Pritsker, 2002, A Rational Expectations Model of Financial Contagion, Journal of Finance, 57, 769-799., 178032=where is the daily or hourly return of asset on day , is the target rate surprise on day , and is the time-varying estimated CAPM beta for firm on day .

This finding is consistent with the reaction to the September 18, 2007 announcement shown in Figure 1 and with Wongswan (2005) and Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2006), who analyze the response of stock market indexes in 15 and 50 different countries, respectively, to FOMC announcements, and also find that several countries react more strongly to FOMC announcements than the U.S. equity index itself. In Section 4 we explore different explanations for this phenomenon., 74948=Jensen, Gerald R. and Robert R.

The advantage of studying firm level data is that we will be able to test policy transmission channels that we would otherwise not be able to explore with aggregate equity price data. Furthermore, firm-level data will allow us to understand why foreign firms on average react slightly more to FOMC surprises than domestic firms., 77966=Loderer, C., and Pichler, 2000, Firms, Do you Know Your Currency Risk Exposure?
