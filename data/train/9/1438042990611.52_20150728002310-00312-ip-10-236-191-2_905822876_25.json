    "textAfterTable": "Carly from Virginia Beach, VA 03/06/2011 Reviewer is A current student here. 3 out of 3 people found this review useful. 2 of 137 Categories Comments Great for these types of students TCC is great for students that like a laid back college environment. The Virginia Beach campus is close to the beach and to the mall, so there are plenty of places to spend time between classes. Tips for prospective students Sign up for your classes as quickly as possible, especially chemistry classes because they fill up fast. After you sign up for your classes go straight to financial aid and make sure your classes are covered because this school doesn't play around or go out of their way to help you out unless you ask for it. Bang for the buck The prices for this school are decent and I love the way financial aid works. Before you go to the bookstore you get a little slip of paper saying how much you have in your financial aid account & what all",
