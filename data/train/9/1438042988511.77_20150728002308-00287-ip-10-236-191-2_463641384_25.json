The glass of the third optical element 172 has been heated before or during the pressing to a temperature at which it has a viscosity of less than 1010 dPa\ufffds, in particular less than 109 dPa\ufffds, and has therefore formed a lasting connection with the glass of the second optical element 170. In this exemplary embodiment, the third optical element 172 has the form of a Fresnel lens.}",

With such a viscosity of the second glass, it forms a lasting connection with the first glass which is stable even after cooling. Plastics do not exhibit such a behavior, for example, which is why it is particularly preferable to use glass., 100477=The melting temperatures for melting the glass and/or the glass ceramic preferably lie between 1400 and 1700\ufffd C., preferably between 1400 and 1500\ufffd C. The melting and the subsequent cooling are particularly preferably carried out in a crucible, particularly in a platinum vessel. A melting vessel which comprises a Pt/Ir alloy is also particularly preferred., 51238=This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119(a) of German Application No. 10 2004 063 823.3 filed on Dec. 31, 2004 and German Application No. 10 2005 003 594.9 filed on Jan. 25, 2005, the entire contents of both which are incorporated by reference herein., 105312=The first optical element and the second optical element are preferably joined together directly along a common surface region to form a lasting connection, this lasting connection being produced by means of bonding, in particular by means of anodic bonding or by means of a low temperature bonding method as defined in PCT/US00/41721, its priority-forming prior applications and the applications which claim of the priority of PCT/US00/41721 or the priority-forming prior applications of PCT/US00/41721., 88347=The invention furthermore relates to an optical component, which preferably comprises a composite element as described above having a first optical element, which contains a first photosensitive glass and/or a first photosensitive glass ceramic and structures influencing the light propagation at least in a part of its volume, and a second optical element which comprises a second glass and/or a second glass ceramic, the second glass and/or the second glass ceramic being joined together directly with the first glass and/or the first glass ceramic along a common surface region to form a lasting connection, and this lasting connection being produced by means of bonding, in particular by means of anodic bonding or by means of a low temperature bonding method as defined in PCT/US00/41721, its priority-forming prior applications and the applications which claim of the priority of PCT/US00/41721 or the priority-forming prior applications of PCT/US00/41721.}",
