Beyond learning in classrooms with a 13:1 student-to-faculty ratio, your learning will spill out into the world \u00c2? through internships, research and study abroad opportunities., 40633=Because of the size of the classrooms, and the ratio being like 12:1 or 14:1, it creates a more one-on-one experience and the teacher can challenge students individually. So, even if the material being studied isn't rigorous, the teachers will challenge each student to a different capacity that they can handle., 112129=Usually you are only allowed to miss three classes sessions per class before they withdraw you from the class, but certain professors allow more. Also, if your more than five minutes late it counts as an absence. Most professors do offer extra credit but not always. Last, there is workship hours you have to complete which are basically community service hours, 45 hours are due every year in May., 255820=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 222145=Because of the small classes (13:1 teacher to student ratio), the rigor of many of the classes is very challenging. It is doable, but you have to put time and effort into it, just as you would anywhere you go. Make sure you have your priorities right and develop time management. If you get those two things together, you will be able to accomplish anything.}",
