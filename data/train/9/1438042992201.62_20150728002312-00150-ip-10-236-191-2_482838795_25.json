Examples of scheduler systems that may be used include the OAG Flight Desk (Official Airlines Guide, a division of Reed Travel Group) or schedule components of computer reservation systems (CRS=s) such as Sabre7, Apollo7, Amadeus7 and WorldSpan7. It is preferable in order to obtain the largest number of possible itineraries to use a scheduler with dynamic connection generation. Such a scheduler is described in co-pending patent application entitled SCHEDULER SYSTEM FOR TRAVEL PLANNING SYSTEM, Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with the detailed description thereof, the foregoing description is intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the scope of the appended claims. Other aspects, advantages, and modifications are within the scope of the following claims. OTHER EMBODIMENTS A computer travel planning system that outputs a diversity of travel options may be built by combining a travel planning system that transmits a larger set of solutions to a second computer system that reduces the set of travel options using diversity procedures as described above. The diversity process can be run more than once with different travel option preference functions (a set of F's). For example, a travel planning system may wish to output a diversity of travel options that include diverse options that are cheap and diverse options that are convenient, reflecting uncertainty in whether a traveler is cost-sensitive or convenience-sensitive. Given set of travel options Ts 401, a set of preference functions Fs, and a desired number of answers for each preference function Ns, the alternative diversity process 400 returns a reduced set of diverse travel options Rts. The alternative diversity process initializes 402 a list of result travel options RTs to be empty and for each preference function F in the set of preference functions Fs and",
