            "SYSTEM AND APPARATUS FOR POWER-EFFICIENTLY DELIVERING WEBPAGE CONTENTS IN A BROADCAST NETWORK - Embodiments provide bandwidth efficient mechanisms for delivering rich media content, such as webpages, to receiver devices via a multimedia broadcast network. Content, such as selected webpages, is broadcast as disassembled content elements via the broadcast network. To enable reception, the disassembled content elements are broadcast according to a broadcast schedule that is communicated in an overhead content description flow, such as a catalog file. Receiver devices receive the catalog file and use the metadata information to selectively receive disassembled content and store the content elements in memory. When a user requests access to the content (e.g., a webpage via a web browser), an application operating in the receiver device assembles the requested content from the previously received and stored disassembled content elements, and passes the assembled webpage to a using or rendering application.",

A device receiving out-of-order packets on the same ingress interface is capable of determining a proper order for the incoming packets having different upstream paths. Packets may be reordered at a relay device or a destination device based upon where a path update is initiated. Reordering packets from the various upstream paths may be dependent upon a type of service associated with the packet.",
            "DISTRIBUTED PATH UPDATE IN HYBRID NETWORKS - A network condition prompts a hybrid device to select a new path for a packet stream. A path update may occur in response to a change in network topology or a traffic loading condition (e.g., congestion or saturation of a link in the current path). Path selections may be made at each hybrid device in the path from a source hybrid device to a destination hybrid device. A path update procedure may be dependent upon path selection procedures that are optimized for a hybrid network in which multiple hybrid devices may be utilized for a particular path. Path update for load balancing may be dependent upon whether a packet stream is elastic or non-elastic.",
            "DISTRIBUTED PATH SELECTION IN HYBRID NETWORKS - A hybrid device may select a next hop for a packet stream based upon a path selection. The path selection includes calculating end-to-end path capacity for candidate paths to a destination device. End-to-end path capacity is calculated based upon contention groups of particular links in at least one of the plurality of paths. Selected paths are recorded in a stream forwarding table for use with subsequent packets of a packet stream. In some embodiments, each hybrid device independently performs path selection logic or path update logic for a packet stream.",
