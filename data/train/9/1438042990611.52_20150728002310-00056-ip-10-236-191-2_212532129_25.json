Chodas (1952- ) is a member of the Solar System Dynamics Group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. His work has contributed to the understanding of cometary nongravitational forces, the use of radar data in asteroidal and cometary orbits, orbital error analyses, earth close approaches and impact probabilities. He developed the system that allowed the use of radar landmark data on the surface of Venus for improved orbital solutions of the Magellan spacecraft. Citation prepared by D. K. Yeomans, a colleague of the honoree.
