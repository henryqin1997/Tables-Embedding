We eliminate the requirement for licensees to narrowband to 6.25 kHz technology by December 2016, thereby enabling licensees to extend the life of existing systems and providing public safety with greater flexibility in determining the optimal future use of the band. In addition, we revise and update the technical rules for the band to enhance interoperability and open up certain channels to new uses, and we release reserve spectrum to provide additional capacity, particularly for public safety licensees relocating to the 700 MHz band from the T-Band (470-512 MHz). These rule changes enhance the ability of public safety licensees to use this spectrum to protect the safety of life and property.}",
