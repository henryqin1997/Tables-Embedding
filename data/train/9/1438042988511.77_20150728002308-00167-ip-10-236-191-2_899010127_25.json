The tuition, fees and books total less than half the cost of most universities in Alabama when you consider their tuition, fees, books, housing and meal plans. Some students may shirk away from continuing to live at home for a while after graduation, but if you can cope with it you will save so much money as opposed to going straight to a university. Scholarships are fairly easy to come by; I was awarded two from the college when I first started here. (These two scholarships combined cover ALL of my full time tuition and fees costs and they are not big scholarships. That's how reasonable the cost is!) If you are good at writing essays and score above a 24 or so on the ACT, you can probably get a scholarship or two. Considering the available student activities and social events, free math tutoring, and other features of the college, it is a very good deal and very easy on your wallet. The cost of books is also greatly lessened by the plethora of event boards around campus where students post their used books for sale. Am enjoying being here Despite some cons, I am really enjoying being",
