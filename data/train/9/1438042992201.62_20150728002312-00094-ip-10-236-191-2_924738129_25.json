The Commission seeks to develop a flexible and streamlined regulatory framework that will encourage efficient, innovative uses of the spectrum and to allow various services to operate on an interference-protected basis. In doing so, it further seeks to adopt service rules that will allow for the deployment of the various radar applications in this band, both within and outside the U.S. The Commission takes this action in response to a petition for rulemaking filed by Robert Bosch, LLC (Bosch) and two petitions for reconsideration of the 2012 Vehicular Radar R&O., 68494=Title 47 published on 2014-10-01, 131576=In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) further extends the deadline for filing comments on the Auction 1000 Request for Comment, which initiates the pre-auction process by which the Federal Communications Commission will develop detailed procedures for the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction, taking into account public comment received in response to its proposals., 49035=This document amends procedural rules implemented by the Commission's 2011 determination that docketing and electronic filing be utilized in proceedings involving \u201c[n]ewly filed formal common carrier complaints and newly filed pole attachment complaints before the Enforcement Bureau.\u201d The rule changes also apply to future filings made in existing Section 208 formal complaints and pole attachment complaints. In addition, the amendments make a few procedural changes to existing Section 208 formal complaint and pole attachment complaint filing rules to create uniformity among them and ease of administration for parties and staff when initiating service of pleadings or filing confidential matters with the Commission. The rules further establish a single electronic inbox within Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) to handle the initial filing of the above-identified new complaints. Accepted complaints will receive a distinct ECFS docket number; rejected complaints will remain on ECFS but will be stored within the Inbox., 73048=The Incentive Auction Task Force provides the results of several staff simulations of the initial clearing target optimization procedure proposed in the Auction 1000 Comment PN and/or Comment PN as discussed further in this under the Supplementary Information. In this document, the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) Incentive Auction Task Force seeks comment on the data and analyses released in this document and the attached Appendix., 68108=\u00a7 1451 - Deadlines for auction of certain spectrum, 67965=\u00a7 1404 - National security restrictions on use of funds and auction participation, 137378=The Auction 1000 Request for Comment initiates the pre-auction process by which the Federal Communications Commission will develop detailed procedures for the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction, taking into account public comment received in response to its proposals. The Auction 1000 Request for Comment includes specific proposals, including on determination of the initial broadcast television spectrum clearing target, opening bid prices, benchmarks for the final stage rule, and the final television channel assignment process, and seeks comment on those proposed procedures., 67883=\u00a7 1403 - Enforcement, 44262=This document contains corrections to the final regulations to the Commission's rules which were published in the Federal Register on Thursday, November 6, 2014 (79 FR 65906).

This document contains corrections to the adopted date., 202947=The Federal Communications Commission published a document in the Federal Register of October 27, 2014 (79 FR 63883), regarding Petitions for Reconsideration filed of Action in a rulemaking proceeding.
