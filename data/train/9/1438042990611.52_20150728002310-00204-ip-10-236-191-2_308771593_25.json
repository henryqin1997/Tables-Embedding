They work in their own firms or find positions in forest operations management, forest and land management, environmental management and protection, machine development, process engineering, structural design and natural resource conservation. Graduates also pursue advanced degrees in engineering, forestry, business, science, law and other fields. Forest Engineering students receive academic training that addresses the engineering of forest systems, natural resources and related manufacturing industries. The goal of the program is to produce engineers grounded in basic and applied principles in engineering, forestry, natural resources and biosystems. The degree program is designed to teach students to solve problems by considering engineering, as well as, biological aspects of natural resource systems. This problem-solving approach uses a foundation of engineering courses common to all engineering programs, including mathematics, physics, computer applications and the engineering sciences. To emphasize a systems approach, the program also contains a strong foundation in forestry and includes courses in forest biology, forest measurements, surveying, forest economics and forest management. The student builds on these fundamentals by completing additional required courses in engineering and forestry. Developing practical solutions to real-world problems is the focus throughout the program. In the senior year two-quarter senior design experience, the student is part of a design team that develops a solution to an engineering problem presented by a cooperating industrial partner. The forest engineering graduate is thus well-equipped to",
