    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Certain modifications and improvements will occur to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the foregoing description. It should be understood that all such modifications and improvements have been deleted herein for the sake of conciseness and readability but are properly within the scope of the following claims. Notably, the convoluted processes disclosed herein to determine and calculate the various cryptography keys, codes, and numbers, such as the ID number, are for example only. The combination of cryptography and logical operations may be reduced, amplified or modified to provide the desired results. In order to generate the local authentication code the least significant 8 bytes of the tag ID are first XORed with the local authentication code generator DES key, then DES encrypted with the local authentication code generator DES key, and then XORed again with the local authentication code generator key. The result is an 8 byte value that is the local authentication code. The local authentication code is stored in the tag's administrator partition. The local authentication code is also generated by the host 300 at the time the tag is initialized. Each tag 100 gets a different local authentication code that is calculated from the tag ID. Preferably, the generation process uses a DES key supplied by POS device provider for this purpose. The local authentication code Generation Process is shown in FIG. 19. The local authentication code can be",
