    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{99857=Approximately 90% or more of the injected dose is excreted within the first 24 hours, with the peak urine concentrations occurring in the first hour after administration. Plasma and urine iohexol levels indicate that the iohexol body clearance is due primarily to renal clearance. An increase in the dose from 500 mgI/kg to 1500 mgI/kg does not significantly alter the clearance of the drug. The following pharmacokinetic values were observed following the intravenous administration of iohexol (between 500 mgI/kg to 1500 mgI/kg) to 16 adult human subjects: renal clearance\u2014120 (86-162) mL/min; total body clearance\u2014131 (98-165) mL/min; and volume of distribution\u2014165 (108-219) mL/kg., 121549=Transient alterations in vital signs may occur and their significance must be assessed on an individual basis. Those reactions reported in clinical studies with OMNIPAQUE are listed below in decreasing order of occurrence, based on clinical studies of 1531 patients., 72692=Cardiovascular System: Ventricular tachycardia (0.5%), 2:1 heart block (0.5%), hypertension (0.3%), and anemia (0.3%)., 74834=Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmias including PVCs and PACs (2%), angina/chest pain (1%), and hypotension (0.7%). Others including cardiac failure, asystole, bradycardia, tachycardia, and vasovagal reaction were reported with an individual incidence of 0.3% or less. In controlled clinical trials involving 1485 patients, one fatality occurred. A cause and effect relationship between this death and iohexol has not been established., 15653=The recommended oral dosage of OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations of 6 mgI/mL to 9 mgI/mL for contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen in adults is 500 mL to 1000 mL. Smaller administered volumes are needed as the concentration of the final solution is increased (see Table below). In conjunction with dilute oral administration, the recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 administered intravenously is 100 mL to 150 mL. The oral dose is administered about 20 to 40 minutes prior to the intravenous dose and image acquisition.}",
