            "parking is awful so people are forced to park down a ways in the park which is not safe at night. there is also a parking garage a ways off campus but buses running to there stop at only 6:00 at night! walking all the way over there is not safe either! the only redeeming quality is that the campus provides security if you contact them and they will escort you to your car. still, considering how many night classes the campus offers the safety is a big issue.",
            "the numbers of clubs and activities is endless. there is absolutely something for everyone.",
            "if you are a sports fanatic, this is your place. if you place more emphasis on fraternities/sororities and other extracurricular activities then this is also a good place. education-wise the campus is good but if you want top of the line education and less of a community this is not the place to be.",
            "the ranking of the school is not spectacular and the tuition is reasonable. but it's really the outrageous amounts and size of the fees that they slip into tuition costs. they have fees for things that one can't even understand what they're used for. so while tuition is really reasonable the absurd fees are not. thankfully they have such a fantastic philosophy and religious studies department that (almost) every penny is worth staying.",
            "football is hugely popular. it's not my cup of tea but if it's someone else's then this is where one wants to spend their weekends. there are parties and tons of events leading up to every game. outside of football and sports the campus has midnight mojo which is a safe, alcohol-free party hosted every once in a while. it's a way to get out and hang with people who share your values.",
            "the cafe in the library is pretty good; their coffee is starbucks and really worth it for late night studying. the cafeteria in the student center has at least five ethnic foods to choose from and you get a lot of bang for your buck. plus, during lunch hour, the place smells amazing. aromatherapy at its finest.",
            "i've never been in the dorms but i've heard it's not a fun place to be; too rowdy and lots of people who don't like one another end up together. plus, it's pretty expensive all things considered.",
            "the entry level classes are a piece of cake but beware of online! some of them can be a lot of work but considering you're doing them from the comfort of your own home they're still a-okay! the upper-level classes are truly remarkable; you get your money's worth in time and knowledge gained!",
            "don't get caught up in the sports and the parties. the education is really the best part of this campus. also, do lots of research on prospect instructors; it will be the most valuable time you'll ever spend. use the library to your advantage...even with the advent of the internet the amounts of knowledge and legitimacy of a good old paperback book is unparalleled.",
            "some of the most amazing philosophy instructors in the country! plus, their library is one of the best i've seen. third, they put tons of emphasis on extracurricular and academic societies that make it a personable campus."

If you ask the reason it's because most students taking that class could apply for medical school., 95188=parking is awful so people are forced to park down a ways in the park which is not safe at night. there is also a parking garage a ways off campus but buses running to there stop at only 6:00 at night! walking all the way over there is not safe either! the only redeeming quality is that the campus provides security if you contact them and they will escort you to your car. still, considering how many night classes the campus offers the safety is a big issue., 48395=UNO is equipped with 200 programs of study and is home to a diverse population. Student to Faculty ratio at the University is 19:1, meaning that the staff is here to help you. Be prepared to work hard in order to achieve your goals, but as long as you take advantage of the many opportunites of resources, you will be just fine., 364348=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 29256=UNO has a lot to do for fun, it only matters what you think is fun. At the new and stunning HYPR Building they have: an inside/upper-level track, a rock climbing area, a spa, an Olympic size pool, workout station, basket-ball courts, and other courts and areas for classes like, ballet, yoga, zumba, etc. They have a multicultural hour every week where people from all over the world come together to play a game, like baseball or soccer, or to have a conversation and culture themselves. UNO has many sororities, and fraternities, clubs like the equestrian club, tennis club, quittage club, larping club, equality club, Christian clubs, Muslim clubs, etc. There is also always something going on with the college, for example the other week they had a local theme park give free admissions to students with their I.D. card from 9:00 until 12:00 in the evening.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Of course every school's tuition is expensive, but as long as you fill out the FAFSA or put some effort into scholarship searches, you will find financial aid. As for UNO compensating for the prices, they certainly offer many amenities outside of class for tuition. There's HPER for working out, an extensive library, and great student center right on campus for all students to take advantage of. Am enjoying being here Even though I am not living on campus, I made sure to get involved in organizations to meet new people. The campus is beautiful and very easy to get around on. I have met new people in all of my classes and enjoy the overall camaraderie on campus. I love the feel of UNO. Am learning a lot I just completed my first semester and I sincerely learned something new and interesting in each of my classes. All of my professors were incredibly knowledgeable in their respective areas of study. Just by attending class I really learned a lot about each subject.
