            "I like Becker because of how small it is, and the classroom sizes. There are some things I don't like about it; I think it is to expensive and we pay so much and still have to pay for extras. The school is well known for veterinary studies."

Lane hall and Winslow hall which are both current resident halls have been rumored to be haunted. Winslow at one point was a funeral parlor so there have been accounts of strange things happening from time to time. Also May house which was a residence hall is now closed and is recognized as a historical site as it was once a stop on the Underground Rail Road during the 1800's., 78308=We've been starting all sorts of new traditions here; to welcome the incoming freshmen we will have a ceremony during the fall semester; there is a bonfire at the beginning of the year; etc. On Leicester campus we have May House, which was part of the underground railroad.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students You need to keep your grades up and work hard. Have fun!!!! Get scholarships Love what you are majoring for and work hard to get to your goal. Bang for the buck It is expensive to go here unless you get a scholarship or work study. So you want to keep your grades up as in A's and B's in school and you will get a big scholarship from them. So yes it is expensive but it is the best thing that you can ever pay for this college is just great. Am enjoying being here I love being here. The Leicester campus is beautiful and quiet it is where most of the sports teams are. The Worcester campus is louder more city like and you get to live in houses because it is in the middle of the neighborhood where it is located. This is a very nice college and it has all the majors that I wanted to go into. So that is a plus because there aren't many colleges that have both the vet tech program and the equestrian studies program. Am learning a lot I am learning a lot the teachers here are wonderful and",
