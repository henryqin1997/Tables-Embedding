    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{223494=On Sat., July 21, we attended a family wedding in Stone and the reception in Kempsey (at The Nash). We arrived at the hotel the night before, on July 20, after taking a taxi from Birmingham Rail \u2026 See More\u00a0 Station to the hotel. We were in the midst of the flooding that devastated much of south western England. The reception staff at the hotel were very busy, but took care of us. The main problem with theWorcester Whitehouse Hotel is the flock of seagulls that loudly scream and squawk 24 hours a day. There was no relief! In addition, the mirror in our bathroom was missing...the reception staff said ithad broken and was due to be replaced. Under the circumstances of the flood conditions, I can understand that some repairs/maintenance issues were being delayed, but the seagull problem must be dealtwith as soon as possible. My understanding is that it is an ongoing problem and the seagull eggs are being painted with something to prevent hatching. Not soon enough for the hapless guests of theWorcester Whitehouse Hotel. Other than that, our stay was satisfactory and the location close to the train station made for a quick, convenient exit. \u00a0 Collapse\u00a0, 238984=May Bank Holiday week family holiday to cottage in Bude, Cornwall began with a pleasant nights stay at the Travelodge, Worcester to break up the drive from York to Bude. Good idea to break up the \u2026 See More\u00a0 long journey because in total the drive was over 9 hours long due to the volume of traffic. Overall driving in Cornwall was good and the weather for the end of May was okay, warm with one or two showersoverall the 6 days. Visited some great family venues in Cornwall from historic sites, like Tintagel and Lands End to a theme park (Flambards, Helston). All attractions are now charging entrance feesor including different unassociated events like the Doctor Who expo at Lands End which is expected to cost and is not included in the entry fee to Lands End. Eating out on our holiday was diversefrom the fast food outlets we all know to small private restaurants but overall and excellent selection to suit all tastes. \u00a0 Collapse\u00a0, 306024=We visited Worcester during the first weekend in October and as we were lucky with the weather we were able to have a really good stroll round. We walked from our hotel in Foregate Street, through \u2026 See More\u00a0 the shops, of which there is a really good selection, and we ended the morning at the Cathedral. The Cathedral is worth seeing and is set in a very pretty location, right by the river. We took astroll along the river to a cafe called The Quay. The food was really good and the staff friendly and helpful. During the afternoon we strolled back through the shops and went for a swim in our hotel,the Worcester Whitehouse. The following day we visited Royal Worcester which is well worth a visit. \u00a0 Collapse\u00a0, 352113=Need Help? Call: 01904 717 362 (calls charged at standard rates), 352282=\u00a9 1996-2015.
