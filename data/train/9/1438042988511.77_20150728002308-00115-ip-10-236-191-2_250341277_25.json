He\r\nthrew for 257 yards last week and completed 9-of-14 passes for\r\n142 yards in this one as California (1-1) won its home opener.\r\n\r\nIn their first meeting with Southern Mississippi, the Golden\r\nBears used terrific special teams and tough defense.  They\r\nblocked a punt for a score three minutes into the second\r\nquarter, registered seven sacks and used an interception by Mike\r\nMcGrath to set up Robertson's four-yard TD pass to Hall with 16\r\nseconds left in the first half.\r\n\r\nAfter Cross's 30-yard TD made it 27-2 with 9:53 left in the\r\nthird, Echemandu raced in for a 60-yard score to cap the scoring\r\nwith 10:20 to play.\r\n\r\nMickey D'Angelo threw for 163 yards for the Golden Eagles, who\r\nwere playing their season opener and lost their first game\r\nagainst a Pac-10 Conference opponent.\r\n\r\nD'Angelo completed 16-of-26 passes, but was sacked four times.}",
