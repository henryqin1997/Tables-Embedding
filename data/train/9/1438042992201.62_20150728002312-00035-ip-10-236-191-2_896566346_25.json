            "A&T is a wide campus surrounded by many places where you can go on or off campus. From shopping and going out to eat or somewhere quiet to study or clubs to drop it like it's hot; And of course who can forget the block party and GHOE (Greatest Home Coming On Earth)!",
            "If you want to come out of A&T as a proud student if high grades you must STUDY! STUDY! STUDY! Use campus resources like computer labs and the library, and always meet your professors it is essential to meet your professor and talk to them about class, work, and your situation outside of class.",
            "A&T is pretty costly in my own opinion but what college isn't. I have compared prices and reviews of many different colleges, and even have done campus visits: including Chapel Hill, ECU, High Point University, UNCG, and Greensboro College. I've compared their programs, book cost, and so on. A&T is relatively cheap compared to the other schools but they tend to have better and higher honors(HPU, ECU, & Chapel Hill). But A&T creates a lot of their books or have them specialized so their pretty costly and so are their on campus restaurants.",
            "I have enjoyed my time here at Aggie Land even though it's only have been a few months. A&T has basically many different programs happening here all of the time. The vast amount of programs range from international studies to study sessions and hundreds of clubs.",
            "Here at NC A&T you do learn a lot more in a shorter time than you do in high school so naturally you must pay attention and have good organizing and listening skills to past with good grades. You learn that really quick. I am a freshman studying hard for my midterms and never had to study as extensively as this. A&T is a school that pushes their students to the limit and then some and I am proud to shout my Aggie Pride!"

I The reason why I would give my school a 10 is because there are certain things about the University that are just fantastic. I I'm glad that I attend the University and can not wait until graduation in May of 2015., 50471=North Carolina A&T, is a great school, and has outstanding engineering programs. I am a current Mechanical Engineer major, that plans to graduate in 2016, and i have absolutely no complaints at all about the school; the people here are great and welcoming. North Carolina A&T is a great place to pursue your college career, and you will not regret it; theres always something to do., 591173=The food here is good for the most part. The dinning hall closes at 8:30 p.m. which I believe is too early, but other than that everything is pretty much delicious., 130493=From what I have heard about A&T, they have great academics and proffesors. A&T is currently ranked #12, in the top HBCU's of 2011., 705755=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 3156=I just graduated from A&T in May, and I feel more than ready to begin my Master's of Accounting program at The Ohio State University. Not only am I prepared, but I also managed to get a scholarship for my Master's and for the CPA Exam (which I am already studying for). The classes are challenging, but it is fun to take some of the electives (not all majors have room for electives, so be careful about that)., 304173=Because I am online I only pay 1250 a semester to be a full time student., 218642=Welcome week in august. HOMECOMING in October!!! The Plots are a no go unless you are Greek or are invited and they are with you. And the Greek Pagents., 290046=For prospective students planning to attend North Carolina A&T, I would suggest him or her to stay on top of responsibilities, such as financial aid awards, major changes, class schedules, and payments to the university. The Office of Student Financial Aid can be very slow at verifying awards, causing several students to be forced to take a semester out of school. If he or she (the student) maintains a responsible attitude, this saddening event can easily be avoided. Secondly, I would advise prospective students to prevent themselves from getting too caught up into the campus life. The numerous events that are going on within the campus's area can definitely through students off of their academics; I have noticed this from some students within my class of 2014. Lastly, prospective students must budget and conserve the money that they have as much as they possibly can. As an incoming college student, it is important to save most of the money that is available to him or her for emergencies only. During my freshman year at North Carolina A&T, some friends of mine and I were stranded at a movie theater and neither one of us had a car to drive back to campus. However, with money set aside, we were able to catch a taxi to arrive safely at the university., 243446=I went to the new student orientation April, 6th and I was struck by the sense of community amongst the students. I love the fact that even us incoming freshman were still treated like One of the family. I will be proud to be an Aggie , and I look forward to the experience.}",

Tips for prospective students My tips for prospective students is to stay on top of your work and keep up with your financial aid. Overall, my ideal tip is to have fun and enjoy the campus atmosphere. Bang for the buck For the most part I can honestly say that A&T is worth the buck. You'll have so much fun there that you won't even be concerned on how much money your spending for your education. Did enjoy being here I loved being an Aggie! There were plenty of people that were willing to work with you. The social environment was fantastic and",
