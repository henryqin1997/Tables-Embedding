    "textAfterTable": "DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Interim final rule. Effective Date: This interim final rule is effective on June 19, 2015. Applicability Dates: This interim final rule is applicable to any claim for service connection for an Agent Orange presumptive condition filed by a covered individual that is pending on or after June 19, 2015. Comment date: Comments must be received on or before August 18, 2015. 38 CFR Part 3 Summary The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its regulation governing individuals presumed to have been exposed to certain herbicides. Specifically, VA is expanding the regulation to include an additional group consisting of individuals who performed service in the Air Force or Air Force Reserve under circumstances in which they had regular and repeated contact with C-123 aircraft known to have been used to spray an herbicide agent (\u201cAgent Orange\u201d) during the Vietnam era. In addition, the regulation will establish a presumption that members of this group who later develop an Agent Orange presumptive condition were disabled during the relevant period of service, thus establishing that this service constituted \u201cactive, naval, military or air service.\u201d The effect of this action is to presume herbicide exposure for these individuals and to allow individuals who were exposed to herbicides during reserve service to establish veteran status for VA purposes and eligibility for some VA benefits.",
