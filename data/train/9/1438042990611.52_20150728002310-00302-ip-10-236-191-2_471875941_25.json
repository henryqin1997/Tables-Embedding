Darrow theorized that the hemolysis was due to the transplacental passage of a maternal antibody, antifetal hemoglobin, into the fetal circulation. Her theory was correct, but her postulated antigen (fetal hemoglobin) and antibody were untenable., 5345=Although Hippocrates may have described fetal hemolytic disease (erythroblastosis fetalis, hemolytic disease of the newborn), the first recorded report is that of a French midwife in 1609, who reported the birth of twins: the first was grossly edematous (hydrops fetalis) and died promptly; the second, in good condition at birth, became deeply jaundiced (icterus gravis) and died a few days later., 12994=Fig. 6. X-ray of a hydropic newborn at birth and 6 hours later after exchange transfusion. Note the small heart at the time of birth, with a marked increase in heart size and evidence of pulmonary congestion denoting heart failure 6 hours later. The fetus had extreme ascites.(Bowman JM: Blood-group incompatibilities. In Iffy L, Kaminetzky HA (eds): Principles and Practice of Obstetrics and Perinatology, p 1193. New York, John Wiley & Sons, 1981), 4342=The epoch-making experiments of Landsteiner and Wiener in 1940 revealed the true state of affairs. They produced a rhesus monkey RBC antiserum in rabbits and guinea pigs. The rhesus (Rh) antisera produced agglutination of the RBCs of 85% of a group of white subjects (Rh positive) but not of the remaining 15% (Rh negative). This experiment laid the foundation for safe blood transfusion, the determination of the cause of Rh hemolytic disease, and the development of the science of human anthropology. Although the rhesus monkey antigen, now named LW, is not exactly the same as the human Rh antigen (Rh-negative people usually are weakly LW positive), this in no way diminishes the importance of Landsteiner and Wiener's work., 12471=ISSN: 1756-2228, 3274=Since this work in the 1940s, the complexities of the Rh blood group system have been unraveled. There are more than 40 antigens in the system. Other blood group systems, some of clinical importance, have been discovered. Sensitive methods of screening for blood group antibodies and of measuring their strength are available, and the pathogenesis of maternal blood group immunization and of erythroblastosis fetalis is now known. The severity of erythroblastosis can be assessed accurately in utero. Methods of treatment of both fetus and newborn are now available, and since 1967, there has been a method of preventing Rh immunization, which has reduced its incidence greatly in the past 30 years.}",

Obstet Gynecol 49: 9, 1977, 60021=In 1961, Liley37 reported on a technique of amniotic fluid spectrophotometry that allows accurate comparison of measurements from one laboratory to another. Amniotic fluid must be protected from light, which destroys bilirubin. It is centrifuged and filtered, and optical density measurements are made in a good-quality spectrophotometer and recorded over the visible 700- to 350-nm range. The measurements are plotted on semilogarithmic paper (Fig. 7). Wavelength is the linear horizontal coordinate; optical density is the logarithmic vertical coordinate. The readings are connected. The deflection from linearity at 450 nm (\u0394OD 450) is related to the severity of Rh disease. In fluid not contaminated with blood, a second rise at 405 nm is caused by heme pigment, which denotes severe hemolysis. To calculate the deflection from linearity at 450 nm, a tangent is drawn connecting the reading at 550 nm with the reading at 365 nm. The measurement from the intersection of the tangent with the 450-nm wavelength line to the actual amniotic fluid optical density at 450 nm gives the optical density rise at 450 nm (\u0394OD 450; see Fig. 7)., 183656=Bowman JM: Management of Rh-isoimmunization.

Can Med Assoc J 118: 623, 1978, 150538=Rh immunization during pregnancy, therefore, accounts for about 14% of all cases of Rh immunization (if no Rh prophylaxis is given) and is the most important cause of residual Rh immunization. In Manitoba, it accounted for 69 (41%) of 167 Rh-immunized pregnancies encountered in a 3-year period ending October 31, 1976. Severity of subsequent Rh disease in fetuses of women Rh immunized during pregnancy is just as great as in fetuses of women Rh immunized after delivery., 187698=Lewis M, Bowman JM, Pollock JM et al: Absorption of red cells from the peritoneal cavity of an hydropic twin. Transfusion 13: 37, 1973, 73098=Amniocentesis always should be carried out using careful aseptic technique and local anesthesia. A clotted blood sample should be taken before and 5 minutes after amniocentesis. The needle insertion site is determined by palpation and ultrasound examination. The site is prepared with a suitable antiseptic, draped, and infiltrated with a local anesthetic. The operator introduces a lumbar puncture needle (20 or 22 gauge) through the abdominal wall into the uterus to the depth at which ultrasound has indicated a pocket of amniotic fluid. The stylet is removed, and 10 to 15 mL of fluid are aspirated. If fluid cannot be removed, the needle is withdrawn or inserted slightly. Rotation of the needle may aid the flow of fluid. Normally, amniotic fluid is slightly turbid, and turbidity increases as term is approached. Various degrees of yellow coloration are present. The fluid is protected from light and sent for \u0394OD 450 measurement. After 31 weeks' gestation, it is also examined for the present of pulmonary maturity (lecithin/sphingomyelin [L:S] ratio of more than 2.0:1, phosphatidylglycerol [PG] of more than 2%). The maternal blood samples are sent for Kleihauer fetal cell screening and for antibody titration., 138411=Anti-D IgG has been licensed in North America and Europe since 1968. One prophylactic intramuscular dose in North America is about 300 \u03bcg. In Europe and Australia, the standard doses are 100 \u03bcg and 125 \u03bcg, which have been shown to be just about as effective., 77833=Despite these potential errors, I believe that amniotic fluid spectrophotometry is an accurate biologic screening test. Life-threatening inaccuracies occurred in only 2.1% of the 1170 women who underwent 3351 amniotic fluid examinations., 59329=For many years, obstetricians have observed that the amniotic fluid surrounding a fetus with severe Rh disease is yellow stained.

Residual donor hemoglobin levels in the fetus may be estimated within 1.5 g/dL 95% of the time using the following parameters: 0.85 times the fraction of donor RBCs in the fetoplacental circulation; fetal weight at the gestation donor hemoglobin levels; 125 mL/kg as fetoplacental blood volume; and 1/120 of the donor hemoglobin infused as the daily attrition rate of donor RBCs. For example, the donor RBC hemoglobin concentration at 28 weeks' gestation (fetal weight estimated to be 1150 g) 10 days after intrauterine transfusion (IUT) of 65 mL of donor RBCs with a hemoglobin concentration of 30 g/dL can be determined as follows:, 191978=Bierm\u00e9 SJ, Blanc M, Abbal M et al: Oral Rh treatment for severely immunized mothers.

The Rh-antibody titer that puts a fetus at risk of developing hydrops must be determined for each laboratory (in the Winnipeg Rh Laboratory, the significant titer is 1:16 in albumin, which puts the fetus at a 10% risk of becoming hydropic before term)., 201178=Carapella-de Luca E, Casadei AM, Pascone R et al: Maternofetal transfusion during delivery and sensitization of the newborn against Rhesus D-antigen.

If TPH is diagnosed after delivery of an Rh-positive infant, multiple vials of anti-D IgG (300 \u03bcg) should be given intramuscularly as follows: two vials if the TPH is between 25 and 50 mL of blood; three vials if the TPH is between 50 and 75 mL, and so on. It is recommended that the contents of four vials (1200 \u03bcg) be given intramuscularly every 12 hours until the total dose has been administered. After administration of the total dose of anti-D IgG, the result of the Kleihauer test should be negative, and passive anti-D should be present in the maternal circulation., 182720=Brown SJ, Perkins JT, Sosler SD et al: The monocyte- monolayer assay does not predict severity of hemolytic disease of the newborn.

The introduction by Liley49 in 1963 of fetal intraperitoneal transfusion (IPT) completely altered the outlook for these severely affected fetuses., 78211=Because amniocentesis is not without some hazard to the fetus, it should be undertaken only when the history or antibody titer indicates that the fetus is at risk of developing hydrops and dying. Using the history and antibody criteria already outlined as guidelines, only half of Rh-immunized pregnant women require amniocentesis. Amniocentesis should be undertaken at 18 to 19 weeks' gestation, irrespective of the titer, if there is a history of previous stillbirth or an infant who required exchange transfusion. If there is no such history, amniocentesis should be carried out only if there is an antibody titer indicating a risk of hydrops (more than 1:16 in albumin in my institution). If the critical titer is present before 18 weeks, the initial procedure is carried out at 18 to 19 weeks' gestation. If the critical titer is reached after 18 weeks' gestation, amniocentesis should be carried out within 5 to 7 days. Amniocentesis should be performed at 5- to 21-day intervals, depending on the \u0394OD 450 measurement of the preceding amniotic fluid and the direction of the slope of the serial \u0394OD 450 measurements already taken. Amniotic fluid \u0394OD 450 readings may increase rapidly. It may be necessary to carry out amniocentesis at weekly intervals for 6 to 8 weeks before the \u0394OD 450 slope is such that the interval may be increased or definitive treatment such as fetal transfusion or early delivery may be carried out., 194121=Berlin G, Selbing A, Ryden G: Rhesus haemolytic disease treated with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin [Letter]. Lancet 1: 1153, 1985, 134947=Whereas our ability to suppress Rh immunization is doubtful, our ability to prevent Rh immunization is unquestionable, representing a major advance in the management of Rh-negative pregnant women. In 1900, the same year that Landsteiner described the ABO blood group system, Von Dungern, from ox RBC rabbit injection studies, proved the axiom that active immunization to an antigen (ox RBCs) is prevented by the presence of passive antibodies to the antigen (rabbit ox RBC antibodies).73 It is a comment on the rapidity of dissemination of scientific knowledge that this piece of basic research was not applied to the clinical problem of Rh prevention until 25 years after the discovery of the Rh blood group system and the elucidation of the pathogenesis of Rh immunization., 180045=Zupanska B, Brojer E, Richards Y et al: Serological and immunological characteristics of maternal anti-Rh(D) antibodies in predicting the severity of haemolytic disease of the newborn.

Am J Obstet Gynecol 95:1129, 1966, 98807=Pioneering attempts at direct IVT into either a fetal or placental vessel approached through a hysterotomy incision were attempted in the mid-1960s.53,54,55 The results were abysmal because the women almost invariably went into labor. In 1981, Rodeck and associates56 introduced direct transfusion through a fetoscope. Few others have achieved his skill with the fetoscope. Blood, meconium, or turbidity in the amniotic fluid makes fetoscopic visualization of the fetal blood vessels impossible. With the advent of fetal blood sampling, by the early to mid-1980s44 it became possible to follow the sampling procedure with direct IVT.57,58,59,60,61 Under ultrasound guidance, the tip of a 22- or 20-gauge spinal needle is introduced into a umbilical blood vessel, preferably the vein but occasionally the artery, at its insertion into the placenta and rarely at its insertion into the fetal abdomen., 8861=In 1992, the Rh(D) and Rh(non-D) polypeptides were cloned. Cartron and his group8 have determined that the Rh blood group locus is the product of two homologous structural genes, one of which encodes the Cc Ee polypeptide; the other (missing in Rh(D)-negative people) encodes the D antigen polypeptide. The predicted translation of the Rh(D) mRNA is a 417-aminoacid product with a molecular weight of 45,000. The D and Cc/Ee polypeptides differ by 36 aminoacid substitutions (8.4% divergence). The similarity between the two genes supports the belief that they evolved by duplication of a common ancestral gene., 191694=Carter BB: Preliminary report on a substance which inhibits anti-Rh serum.

Anti-D IgG made by this process is effective and has a low incidence of untoward reactions. It does contain small amounts of IgA and IgM and traces of other plasma proteins. Some women, after a second or third injection, develop transient rashes, pain, and swelling at the injection site. There was one report of severe anaphylaxis after the use of Cohn-prepared anti-D IgG.94 Cohn-prepared anti-D IgG is anticomplementary and must not be given intravenously. The yield of anti-D in the IgG prepared by the Cohn method is at best only 40% to 50% and may be as low as 35% of that in the starting plasma., 173812=Le Van Kim C, Mouro I, Chrif-Zahar B et al: Molecular cloning and primary structure of the human blood group RhD polypeptide.

    "textBeforeTable": "TABLE 1. Rh Gene Frequencies in a White Canadian Population of 2000 Unrelated Adults Because anti-d has never been determined, a man's zygosity for D can only be determined if he fathers two infants who have received different sets of antigens from him. Because certain sets of antigens are more common than others (Table 1), determination of the presence or absence of the other Rh antigens, C, E, c, and e, indicates the likely, but not certain, zygosity of the father for D (Table 2). Slightly fewer than half of Rh-positive people are homozygous for D (i.e., they have inherited a set of antigens containing D from both sets of parents). The remainder are heterozygous for D (i.e., they have inherited a D-containing set from only one parent). The D zygosity of an Rh-positive mate of an Rh-negative woman is important. If he is homozygous, all of his children will be Rh-positive; if he is heterozygous, there is an equal chance that the fetus will be Rh- negative or Rh-positive. Only Rh-positive fetuses can cause Rh immunization, and only Rh-positive fetuses are affected by the Rh antibody produced. The Rh blood group system is still the most important factor in erythroblastosis fetalis. It is made up of a family of inherited antigens. Although Wiener's theory of a single gene locus occupied by a pair of complex agglutinogens is the most accurate,1 the nomenclature and theories of inheritance",
