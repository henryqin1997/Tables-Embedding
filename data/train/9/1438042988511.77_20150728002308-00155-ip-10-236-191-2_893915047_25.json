    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck This is the best part about Olympic College! For a good education (depending on how much you put into it!) you get it at an even better price. As compared to going directly into a 4 year university, I would HIGHLY recommend going to O.C. for a few of the general classes, or better yet the first two years THEN transferring. Even if you plan at stopping at an Associates degree, O.C. is definitely a bang for the buck and yet will still provide you with the resources you need to be successful. Am enjoying being here How much you enjoy it here depends on how willing you are to meet new people, be open minded, and the attitude you bring to the college. The environment at Olympic College is friendly and there are often events held in the student center that offer a chance for you to get involved and meet others. The more involved you get, the more you will enjoy it at Olympic College. Am learning a lot Maybe I have just gotten lucky with my choice of professors, but Olympic College has provided (for the most part) instructors that try their best to connect with the students. Most teachers are willing",
