Wind River Systems then paid several additional authors to make a number of improvements to the print-output infrastructure and to add additional chapters to the text. This work culminated in the publication of the second printed edition in November 2001 (ISBN 1-57176-303-1). In 2003-2004, FreeBSD Mall, Inc, paid several contributors to improve the Handbook in preparation for the third printed edition., 18452=FreeBSD\u00a02.2 was branched from the development mainline (``-CURRENT'') in November 1996 as the RELENG_2_2 branch, and the first full release (2.2.1) was released in April 1997. Further releases along the 2.2 branch were done in the summer and fall of '97, the last of which (2.2.8) appeared in November 1998. The first official 3.0 release appeared in October 1998 and spelled the beginning of the end for the 2.2 branch., 18012=The tree branched again on Jan 20, 1999, leading to the 4.0-CURRENT and 3.X-STABLE branches. From 3.X-STABLE, 3.1 was released on February 15, 1999, 3.2 on May 15, 1999, 3.3 on September 16, 1999, 3.4 on December 20, 1999, and 3.5 on June 24, 2000, which was followed a few days later by a minor point release update to 3.5.1, to incorporate some last-minute security fixes to Kerberos. This will be the final release in the 3.X branch., 112347=Copyright \u00a9 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 The FreeBSD Documentation Project, 19672=FreeBSD then set about the arduous task of literally re-inventing itself from a completely new and rather incomplete set of 4.4BSD-Lite bits. The ``Lite'' releases were light in part because Berkeley's CSRG had removed large chunks of code required for actually constructing a bootable running system (due to various legal requirements) and the fact that the Intel port of 4.4 was highly incomplete. It took the project until November of 1994 to make this transition, at which point it released FreeBSD\u00a02.0 to the net and on CDROM (in late December). Despite being still more than a little rough around the edges, the release was a significant success and was followed by the more robust and easier to install FreeBSD\u00a02.0.5 release in June of 1995., 20961=The first CDROM (and general net-wide) distribution was FreeBSD\u00a01.0, released in December of 1993. This was based on the 4.3BSD-Lite (``Net/2'') tape from U.C. Berkeley, with many components also provided by 386BSD and the Free Software Foundation. It was a fairly reasonable success for a first offering, and we followed it with the highly successful FreeBSD 1.1 release in May of 1994., 18899=We released FreeBSD\u00a02.1.5 in August of 1996, and it appeared to be popular enough among the ISP and commercial communities that another release along the 2.1-STABLE branch was merited. This was FreeBSD\u00a02.1.7.1, released in February 1997 and capping the end of mainstream development on 2.1-STABLE. Now in maintenance mode, only security enhancements and other critical bug fixes will be done on this branch (RELENG_2_1_0)., 22932=The FreeBSD project had its genesis in the early part of 1993, partially as an outgrowth of the ``Unofficial 386BSD Patchkit'' by the patchkit's last 3 coordinators: Nate Williams, Rod Grimes and myself., 20554=Around this time, some rather unexpected storm clouds formed on the horizon as Novell and U.C. Berkeley settled their long-running lawsuit over the legal status of the Berkeley Net/2 tape. A condition of that settlement was U.C. Berkeley's concession that large parts of Net/2 were ``encumbered'' code and the property of Novell, who had in turn acquired it from AT&T some time previously. What Berkeley got in return was Novell's ``blessing'' that the 4.4BSD-Lite release, when it was finally released, would be declared unencumbered and all existing Net/2 users would be strongly encouraged to switch. This included FreeBSD, and the project was given until the end of July 1994 to stop shipping its own Net/2 based product. Under the terms of that agreement, the project was allowed one last release before the deadline, that release being FreeBSD\u00a01.1.5.1., 11113=The FreeBSD core team would be equivalent to the board of directors if the FreeBSD Project were a company. The primary task of the core team is to make sure the project, as a whole, is in good shape and is heading in the right directions. Inviting dedicated and responsible developers to join our group of committers is one of the functions of the core team, as is the recruitment of new core team members as others move on. The current core team was elected from a pool of committer candidates in July 2004. Elections are held every 2 years., 17561=There was another branch on March 13, 2000, which saw the emergence of the 4.X-STABLE branch, now considered to be the ``current -stable branch''. There have been several releases from it so far: 4.0-RELEASE was introduced in March 2000, and the most recent 4.10-RELEASE came out in May 2004. There will be additional releases along the 4.X-stable (RELENG_4) branch well into 2003., 17165=The long-awaited 5.0-RELEASE was announced on January 19, 2003. The culmination of nearly three years of work, this release started FreeBSD on the path of advanced multiprocessor and application thread support and introduced support for the UltraSPARC and ia64 platforms. This release was followed by 5.1 in June of 2003. Besides a number of new features, the 5.X releases also contain a number of major developments in the underlying system architecture. Along with these advances, however, comes a system that incorporates a tremendous amount of new and not-widely-tested code. For this reason, the 5.X releases are considered ``New Technology'' releases, while the 4.X series function as ``Production'' releases. In time, 5.X will be declared stable and work will commence on the next development branch, 6.0-CURRENT.}",

Xorg is the X11 server of the X11R6.7 distribution released by the X.Org Foundation. X11R6.7 is based on the code of XFree86\u00a04.4RC2 and X11R6.6. The X.Org Foundation released X11R6.7 in April 2004., 1014704=If you can confirm that SAP Note 0162266 applies, just set STATUS of the offending step from ERROR to OK (file CENTRDB.R3S) and restart R3SETUP. After installation, you have to execute the report RADDBDIF from transaction SE38., 809442=LPD enables you to limit the maximum byte size a file in a job can be with the mx capability. The units are in BUFSIZ blocks, which are 1024 bytes. If you put a zero for this capability, there will be no limit on file size; however, if no mx capability is specified, then a default limit of 1000 blocks will be used., 946451=For Oracle 8.0.5 to run the intelligent agent, we also had to install the RedHat Tcl package tcl-8.0.5-30.i386.rpm (otherwise the relinking during Oracle installation will not work). There are some other issues regarding relinking of Oracle, but that is a Oracle Linux issue, not FreeBSD specific., 983809=compat-binutils-5.2-2.9.1.0.23.1.i386.rpm, 586850=Since the scanner is not identified, we will need to edit the /usr/local/etc/sane.d/epson.conf file. The scanner model used was the EPSON Perfection\u00ae 1650, so we know the scanner will use the epson backend. Be sure to read the help comments in the backends configuration files. Line changes are quite simple: comment out all lines that have the wrong interface for your scanner (in our case, we will comment out all lines starting with the word scsi as our scanner uses the USB interface), then add at the end of the file a line specifying the interface and the device node used. In this case, we add the following line:, 90920=For a proxy FTP server, you should usually give the name of the server you really want as a part of the username, after an ``@'' sign. The proxy server then ``fakes'' the real server. For example, assuming you want to install from ftp.FreeBSD.org, using the proxy FTP server foo.example.com, listening on port 1024., 398263=Note: If the mouse does not work, you will need to first configure it before proceeding. See Section 2.9.10 in the FreeBSD install chapter., 914680=If you want to run the intelligent agent, you will also need to install the Red Hat Tcl package: tcl-8.0.3-20.i386.rpm. The general command for installing packages with the official RPM port (archivers/rpm) is:, 886762=If it is only one or two versions out of date in the in the trailing digit then do not worry about copying /lib/libc.so.4.6.29 too, because the program should work fine with the slightly older version. However, if you like, you can decide to replace the libc.so anyway, and that should leave you with:, 606614=Note: In FreeBSD\u00a04.2 and older you must replace KERNCONF= with KERNEL=. 4.2-STABLE that was fetched before Feb 2nd, 2001 does not recognize KERNCONF=., 208477=Note: Use fd0.1200 and floppy5 for 5.25\" 1.2\u00a0MB disks., 554818=The default port options should be sufficient for most users. However, if you need the XviD codec, you have to specify the WITH_XVID option in the command line. The default DVD device can also be defined with the WITH_DVD_DEVICE option, by default /dev/acd0 will be used., 560869=To convert input.avi to the MPEG4 codec with MPEG3 audio encoding (audio/lame is required):, 986959=Take the tarball oracle81732.tgz you produced from the installation directory on a Linux system and untar it to /oracle/SID/817_32/., 1013682=If after looking through the logfiles this error is indeed the correct one (check the SAP Notes), you can set STATUS of the offending step from ERROR to OK (file CENTRDB.R3S) and restart R3SETUP. After installation, you have to execute the report RSWBOINS from transaction SE38. See SAP Note 0162266 for additional information about phase RFCRSWBOINI and RFCRADDBDIF., 1006155=If this error is encountered, the correct locale is missing. SAP Note 0171356 lists the necessary RPMs that need be installed (e.g. saplocales-1.0-3, saposcheck-1.0-1 for RedHat 6.1). In case you ignored all the related errors and set the corresponding STATUS from ERROR to OK (in CENTRDB.R3S) every time R3SETUP complained and just restarted R3SETUP, the SAP system will not be properly configured and you will then not be able to connect to the system with a SAPgui, even though the system can be started. Trying to connect with the old Linux SAPgui gave the following messages:, 615779=Starting with FreeBSD\u00a04.5, the system will auto-tune this setting for you if you explicitly set it to 0[5]. In FreeBSD\u00a05.X and above, maxusers will default to 0 if not specified. If you are using an version of FreeBSD earlier than 4.5, or you want to manage it yourself you will want to set maxusers to at least 4, especially if you are using the X Window System or compiling software. The reason is that the most important table set by maxusers is the maximum number of processes, which is set to 20 + 16 * maxusers, so if you set maxusers to 1, then you can only have 36 simultaneous processes, including the 18 or so that the system starts up at boot time and the 15 or so you will probably create when you start the X Window System. Even a simple task like reading a manual page will start up nine processes to filter, decompress, and view it. Setting maxusers to 64 will allow you to have up to 1044 simultaneous processes, which should be enough for nearly all uses. If, however, you see the dreaded proc table full error when trying to start another program, or are running a server with a large number of simultaneous users (like ftp.FreeBSD.org), you can always increase the number and rebuild., 445524=Just as with GNOME or any other desktop environment, the easiest way to install KDE is through the ``Desktop Configuration'' menu during the FreeBSD installation process as described in Section 2.9.13 of Chapter 2. Once again, the software can be easily installed from a package or from the ports collection:, 630586=Real-time extensions added in the 1993 POSIX\u00ae. Certain applications in the ports collection use these (such as StarOffice)., 990581=Otherwise you might get the error ORA-12546 as the sockets will not have the correct permissions. See SAP Note 072984., 960722=SAP requires at least two locales that are not part of the default RedHat installation. SAP offers the required RPMs as download from their FTP server (which is only accessible if you are a customer with OSS access). See note 0171356 for a list of RPMs you need., 938769=For this installation a Dell\u2122 PowerEdge\u2122 2500 was used: a dual processor board with two 1000\u00a0MHz Pentium\u00a0III processors (256\u00a0kB Cache), 2\u00a0GB PC133 ECC SDRAM, PERC/3 DC PCI RAID Controller with 128\u00a0MB, and an EIDE DVD-ROM drive. To the RAID controller are attached two 18\u00a0GB hard disks (mirrored) and four 36\u00a0GB hard disks (RAID level 5)., 1010703=Otherwise you might get ORA-12546 as the sockets will not have the correct permissions. See SAP Note 0072984., 763979=Now, for the hard part: making the filter. For that, we need a DVI-to-LaserJet/PCL conversion program. The FreeBSD Ports Collection (see The Ports Collection) has one: dvi2xx is the name of the package. Installing this package gives us the program we need, dvilj2p, which converts DVI into LaserJet IIp, LaserJet III, and LaserJet 2000 compatible codes., 439486=The easiest way to install GNOME is through the ``Desktop Configuration'' menu during the FreeBSD installation process as described in Section 2.9.13 of Chapter\u00a02. It can also be easily installed from a package or the ports collection:, 139099=Finally there is the TCP Extensions option. This enables the TCP Extensions defined in RFC\u00a01323 and RFC\u00a01644. While on many hosts this can speed up connections, it can also cause some connections to be dropped. It is not recommended for servers, but may be beneficial for stand alone machines., 682061=In general, Parallel interfaces usually offer just one-way communication (computer to printer) while serial and USB gives you two-way. Newer parallel ports (EPP and ECP) and printers can communicate in both directions under FreeBSD when a IEEE1284 compliant cable is used., 401302=The DefaultDepth keyword describes the color depth to run at by default. This can be overridden with the -depth command line switch to Xorg(1) (or XFree86(1)). The Modes keyword describes the resolution to run at for the given color depth. Note that only VESA standard modes are supported as defined by the target system's graphics hardware. In the example above, the default color depth is twenty-four bits per pixel. At this color depth, the accepted resolution is 1024 by 768 pixels., 91299=In this case, you go to the options menu, set the FTP username to ftp@ftp.FreeBSD.org, and the password to your email address. As your installation media, you specify FTP (or passive FTP, if the proxy supports it), and the URL ftp://foo.example.com:1234/pub/FreeBSD., 721508=Sets the communications speed of the device to bps-rate, where bps-rate can be 50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, or 115200 bits-per-second., 984262=For compiling the intelligent agent, the RedHat Tcl package must be installed. If you cannot get tcl-8.0.3-20.i386.rpm, a newer one like tcl-8.0.5-30.i386.rpm for RedHat 6.1 should also do., 644843=The general-purpose I/O (``geek port'') + IEEE1284 I/O., 937905=The following off-the-shelf hardware was used: a dual processor board with 2 800\u00a0MHz Pentium\u00a0III processors, Adaptec\u00ae 29160 Ultra160 SCSI adapter (for accessing a 40/80\u00a0GB DLT tape drive and CDROM), Mylex\u00ae AcceleRAID\u2122 (2 channels, firmware 6.00-1-00 with 32\u00a0MB RAM).

    "textBeforeTable": "Table 2-1. Sample Device Inventory We recommend you print or write down this information before installing FreeBSD. It may help to use a table, like this: If you already have another operating system installed, such as Windows or Linux, it is a good idea to use the facilities provided by those operating systems to see how your hardware is already configured. If you are not sure what settings an expansion card is using, you may find it printed on the card itself. Popular IRQ numbers are 3, 5, and 7, and IO port addresses are normally written as hexadecimal numbers, such as 0x330. Before installing FreeBSD you should attempt to inventory the components in your computer. The FreeBSD installation routines will show you the components (hard disks, network cards, CDROM drives, and so forth) with their model number and manufacturer. FreeBSD will also attempt to determine the correct configuration for these devices, which includes information about IRQ and IO port usage. Due to the vagaries of PC hardware this process is not always completely successful, and you may need to correct FreeBSD's determination of your configuration. 2.2.1 Inventory Your Computer 2.2 Pre-installation Tasks Note: In general, these installation instructions are written for i386 (``PC compatible'') architecture computers. Where applicable, instructions specific to other platforms (for example, Alpha) will be listed. Although this guide is kept as up to",

The FreeBSD installation routine will prompt you before writing any data to your disk, but once that process has started it cannot be undone. 2.2.3 Decide Where to Install FreeBSD If you want FreeBSD to use your entire hard disk, then there is nothing more to concern yourself with at this point -- you can skip this section. However, if you need FreeBSD to co-exist with other operating systems then you need to have a rough understanding of how data is laid out on the disk, and how this affects you. 2.2.3.1 Disk Layouts for the i386\u2122 A PC disk can be divided into discrete chunks.
