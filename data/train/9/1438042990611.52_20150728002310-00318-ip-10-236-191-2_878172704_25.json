Your URL should look similar to this however varying on the endpoint you are requesting data from:  sig = md5(args_concat + api_secret) # expire=1248499222format=jsoninterval=24unit=hour # Output: api_key=ed0b8ff6cc3fbb37a521b40019915f18event=[\"pages\"] args_concat = join(args_sorted) args_sorted = sort_args_alphabetically_by_key(args) (e.g. api_key, unit, interval, expire, format, etc.) excluding sig. args = all query parameters going to be sent out with the request Calculate the signature of the request using your api_secret. Calculating the signature is done in parts: sort the parameters you are including with the URL alphabetically, join into a string resulting in key=valuekey2=value2 (excluding ampersands), concatenate the result with the api_secret by appending it, and lastly md5 hash the final string. This hash is used for the sig parameter in the request therefore it should not be be calculated with sig as a parameter. The purpose of this process is to prevent unauthorized attempts to consume your data as much as possible.
