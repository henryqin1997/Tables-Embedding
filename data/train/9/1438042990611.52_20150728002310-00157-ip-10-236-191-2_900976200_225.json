The campus is 1.2 miles long, you may end up walking pretty far for a class. Once you get used to it though, it's not a big deal., 12373=The downfall of CMU is that the CMU Promise ended in 2007, and so the price of tuition keeps rising. You're still getting what you paid for, but it is beginning to get more and more costly., 1014437=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 24531=There are so many things to do on and off of Central's campus. Central has a recognized Student Activity Center (the SAC) that has weight rooms, fitness equipment, a pool, 2 saunas, a huge hot tub, racquetball, basket ball, volleyball and walleyball courts available to be reserved until midnight. The SAC often has many events including a movie in the pool where a movie is shown (most recently Inception) in the pool on a huge screen and students watch it in tubes. Access to the SAC is free to all students and it is open from 7-midnight. There is also intramural sports that students can participate in throughout the year with seasons lasting about 5 weeks each. CMU just recently opened the newest addition to campus, the event center. The event center hosts many sport competitions and recently hosted Ke$ha in February. The event center will be the place for many more speakers, comedians, groups, and artists that students can go see. The residential life at Central is amazing with extremely spacious dorm rooms (some of the biggest in the state, if not the Nation) and GREAT food in 4 different residential restaurants. There are also convenience stores with food like Bosco sticks and personal pizzas that are open until 2 a.m. Though Mt. Pleasant is not downtown Ann Arbor or East Lansing, there are many things to do around the city including going to The Soaring Eagle Casino which gives players $20 on their birthdays (not many college campuses have a casino). Mt. Pleasant has clubs, a movie theater, bowling alleys, shops, and many events on Central's campus. Mount Pleasant is big enough that you can keep yourself occupied but not so big that you will become distracted from school., 237702=Central Michigan University is a 4 year degree granting institution in Mt Pleasant, Michigan. It offers many majors and is currently building a medical school to be completed in 2013. It is a big school that has all the benefits of a smaller campus., 252672=I love dorm life at Central. I live in Robinson Hall on North Campus and I live with one other roommate, this costs about $2000 extra. I've met a lot of great friends through my dorm. Also, the RA's and RHA push you to get good grades, help you whenever you need it, and you want to get involved they will help you with that too. I had friends in the East Campus dorms and they seemed to love it. The South Campus dorms, also known as The Towers, are where most freshmen live and get quite noisy at night which gets old rather quickly. The South and East Campus dorms are located near the main road which has a lot of restaurants/bars. They also are located near the gym and stadium., 94646=I am from a small town, so when I chose to attend CMU in the fall of 2010 I was nervous, but once I got there I knew that I chose the right school. I am learning a lot in all of my classes as well as other activities on campus that I can attend. CMU is a big campus, at least for me, with a lot of activities to do. There are lectures/ for every kind of thing you can imagine, 833299=Food was great my first year and was just okay my second year. What was nice about the food was all the different choices. Also, not having to cook for yourself was a great thing as well. However, fresh foods last year 2012 the food was not all that great. They would run out of bagels in the morning and dinner food at night., 660307=The sunday before final exams at 12:00 am, students will open their windows of their dorms and proceed to scream as loud as they can into the night. It's very eery hearing thousands of people screaming on an otherwise quiet night., 16925=Central is not the most expensive public college in Michigan, but it is up there. The tuition costs are not that big of a deal, and there are amenities included in the price such as getting into football games for free and having access to the Student Activity Center. The only part of the cost that might be a little excessive comes with the meal plan costs. The dining halls are only open until 7:00 or 7:30 on weekdays and 6:30 on weekends. This makes eating three meals a day difficult sometimes, and having two meals a day is only a couple hundred dollars cheaper. Other than that, the amount of money it costs to go to Central versus the skills and lessons you learn is definitely worth it., 733987=We have Safe Rides that start at 7:30 pm and if you need a ride they will take you for free. Campus police will also take you for free as well. We have these blue buttons around campus, and if you are in trouble or need help, you push one and the police will come to that location.}",

There are always events and activities going on, as well as places for students to study and get schoolwork done. There is a warm feeling to campus, of being included. Even though there are over 27,000 students going to Central, it doesn't feel like that many at all. Bang for the buck Although Central Michigan University isn't the",
