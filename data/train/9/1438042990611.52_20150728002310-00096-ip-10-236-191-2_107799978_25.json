I started speaking out against license proliferation as early as 2005, pointing to the interoperability and compatibility issues raised by having a large number of open source licenses.\u00a0 Many members of the open source community have also embraced the concept of non-proliferation. The reaction to any new license tends to center around whether a new license addresses an unmet need. That\u2019s why I am concerned about a new license proposed by Oracle., 237830=What are your biggest concerns with a centralized IT department?
