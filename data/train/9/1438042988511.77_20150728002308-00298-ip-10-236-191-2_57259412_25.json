But the Raiders did take 7:40 off the clock on their 12-play, 60-yard march as Cleveland took over with just 4:44 to play in the game., 78703=After it looked like the Raiders would settle for three, Oakland used a bit of trickery to take a 24-7 lead. Shane Lechler got the field-goal snap, rose up, and fired a strike to Kevin Boss, who rumbled in for a 35-yard score with 1:23 to go in the third.}",
