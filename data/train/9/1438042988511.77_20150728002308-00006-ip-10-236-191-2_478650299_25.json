    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{58481=Preferred ranges are: 50,000 to 80,000 GPC weight average molecular weight for polyisobutylene; 1:1 to 1:3 bound styrene-butadiene for styrene-budadiene; 10,000 to 65,000 GBC weight average molecular weight for polyvinyl acetate, with the higher molecular weight polyvinyl acetates typically used in bubble gum base; and a vinyl laurate content of 10\u201345% for vinyl acetate-vinyl laurate., 76080=The drying air may be passed over and admixed with the syrup coated gum centers in any way commonly known in the art. Preferably, the drying air is blown over and around or through the bed of the syrup coated gum centers at a flow rate, for large scale operations, of about 2800 cubic feet per minute. If lower quantities of material are being processed, or if smaller equipment is used, lower flow rates would be used., 47267=Preferably the first coating syrup is held for use at an average temperature of at least 100\ufffd F. (38\ufffd C.), more preferably at least 130\ufffd F. ((54\ufffd C.) and most preferably at an average temperature of at least 150\ufffd F. (66\ufffd C.). The average holding time between preparation and application of the first coating syrup will preferably be at least two hours, more preferably at least four hours. Average holding times and temperatures take into account the fact that coating syrups are usually made in batches and used up over a period of time. For example, if a coating syrup were made at 8:00 a.m., and used at a steady rate from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., the average holding time would be five hours. The second coating syrup is preferably held at an average temperature of less than 90\ufffd F. (32\ufffd C.) and for an average period of less than 4 hours., 111217=In Examples 17\u201320, gum arabic is blended in the sugar syrup. In Examples 21 and 22, gum arabic powder is dry charged after a gum arabic solution is applied in the first stages of coating, then this is followed by a hard shell coating of sugar solution or dextrose solution. The 1:1 sugar/aspartame syrup is used to improve the taste quality of the coating. The flavor is applied with coats 10 and 20. The sugar/aspartame syrup is applied with coats 15 and 25., 36292=The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/591,256, filed Jun. 9, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,572,900, which is incorporated by reference., 57891=Synthetic elastomers may include, but are not limited to, polyisobutylene with GPC weight average molecular weights of about 10,000 to about 95,000, isobutylene-isoprene copolymer (butyl elastomer), styrene-butadiene, copolymers having styrene-butadiene ratios of about 1:3 to about 3:1, polyvinyl acetate having GPC weight average molecular weights of about 2,000 to about 90,000, polyisoprene, polyethylene, vinyl acetate-vinyl laurate copolymers having vinyl laurate contents of about 5% to about 50% by weight of the copolymer, and combinations thereof., 48142=The second coating syrup will preferably also include a bulk sweetener at a lower level than in the first coating syrup. It may also include other high-intensity sweeteners in addition to one or more dipeptide sweeteners. To make a preferred second coating syrup, a high-intensity sweetener is blended in a syrup with a portion of a bulk sweetener, preferably a polyol. Preferably the sweeteners in the second syrup are used at a ratio of about 5:1 to about 1:5, more preferably about 1:1, high-intensity sweetener: bulk sweetener. The second coating syrup may preferably be about 50% solids and be held at room temperature. Since aspartame is not highly soluble at room temperature, the preferred second coating syrup is a solution of the polyol with aspartame suspended in water. A coating syrup that includes undissolved compounds is referred to as a suspension syrup.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be appreciated that the compositions and methods of the present invention are capable of being incorporated in the form of a variety of embodiments, only a few of which have been illustrated and described above. The invention may be embodied in other forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive, and the scope of the invention, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. Syrup E is applied in the first five coating applications followed by the application of maltitol powder after each syrup coat. In a special holding tank, at 167\ufffd F. (75\ufffd C.), all of the aspartame/maltitol syrup D is added to 60 kg of syrup E and this combined syrup is used in the next five syrup coating applications, again followed by maltitol powder after each application. Each application is dried in 6 minutes. Thus all syrup D is applied within 30 minutes of being mixed with syrup E. Another nine coats of syrup E are then applied, each coating of syrup being followed by maltitol powder. Syrup E is used for coats 20\u201326, but no maltitol powder is added. Flavor is added with coats 20, 22",
