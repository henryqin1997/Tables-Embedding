    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{86368=The spinneret pack of the invention can be modified to achieve different multiwinged fibers, for example, by changing the number of capillary legs for a different desired wing count, changing slot dimensions to change the geometric parameters as needed for production of a different denier per filament or yarn count, or as desired for use with various synthetic polymers. For example, in the embodiment of FIG. 8 is shown a relatively thin spinneret pack used to make a fiber with three wings. In FIG. 8A, the spinneret plate was 0.015 inches (0.038 cm) thick and had orifices machined through the full thickness of stainless steel, by the laser light methods herein disclosed, in the form of three straight wings 140 each of two widths (having lengths 144 and 146 respectively) and arranged symmetrically at 120 degrees apart around a center of symmetry; there was no counterbore above the capillary orifice. Each wing 140 was 0.040 inches (0.102 cm) long from its tip to the circumference of a central round spinneret hole 142 of 0.012 inches (0.030 cm) diameter whose center coincided with the center of symmetry. Referring next to FIG. 8B, distribution plate B, of 0.010 inch (0.025 cm) thickness, was coaxially aligned over spinneret plate A so that every other wing orifice 150 of distribution plate B was aligned with a wing 140 of spinneret plate A; each wing orifice 150 of distribution plate B was 0.1375 inches (0.349 cm) long from its tip to the center of symmetry. Metering plate C (FIG. 10C) was 0.010 (0.025 cm) inches thick and had holes 160 of 0.025 inch (0.064 cm) diameter, holes 162 of 0.015 inch (0.038 cm) diameter, and central hole 164 of 0.010 inch (0.025 cm) diameter. Plate C was aligned with distribution plate B so that, in use, wing polymer fed by melt pool plate D (see FIG. 8) to holes 160 and core polymer fed to holes 162 and 164 of distribution plate C were distributed by plate B to plate A to form a fiber, in which the wings penetrated the core. There was no counterbore in spinneret plate A, and the combined thickness of plates A, B, and C was only about 0.035 inches (0.089 cm)., 44424=The fiber of the present invention has a substantially radially symmetric cross-section, as can be seen from FIGS. 1-4. By \u201csubstantially radially symmetric cross-section\u201d is meant a cross-section in which the wings are located and are of dimensions so that rotation of the fiber about its longitudinal axis by 360/n degrees, in which \u201cn\u201d is an integer representing the \u201cn-fold\u201d symmetry of the fibers, results in substantially the same cross-section as before rotation. The cross-section is substantially symmetrical in terms of size, polymer and angular spacing around the core. This substantially radially symmetric cross-section impartes an unexpected combination of high stretch and high uniformity without significant levels of two- or three-dimensional crimp. Such uniformity is advantageous in high-speed processing of fibers, for example through guides and knitting needles, and in making smooth, non-\u2018picky\u2019 fabrics, especially sheer fabrics like hosiery. Fibers which have a substantially radially symmetric cross-section possess no self-crimping potential, i.e., they have no significant two- or three-dimensional crimping characteristics. See generally Textile Research Journal, June 1967, p. 449., 104765=As discussed above, the invention combines the biconstituent yarn with the companion yarn to form a single yarn. Each of the biconstituent yarn and combined yarn may be made separately off-line and then combined to form the final synthetic yarn, or one or both may be made on-line in a continuous manner. Combining these components to form a single yarn may be conducted by any known method, including plying, co-spinning, air jet texturing, air false twist texturing, and covering. Plying is simple combining by laying yarns together without mixing of filaments. Plying may be conducted by twisting the yarns together in a draw twister. Typically, the yarns may be twisted at about 0-5 turns-per-inch (tpi), and preferably, \ufffd-\ufffd tpi. Co-spinning is combining by laying yarns together in the spinning process; up to, for example, 4000 meters per minute. Co-spinning may be conducted by commingling yarns in an interlaced jet. Air entangling is a process that causes filaments of the biconstituent and second yarn to become intermingled; typically processing speed is 500 to 1000 meters per minute. Air jet texturing is a process where two yarn are fed to an air jet texturing apparatus; typically one yarn is over-fed (effect yarn) with respect to the other (core yarn). The effect yarn is crimped and bulked and entangled with the core yarn. 100 to 400 meters per minute is a typical speed. Air jet texturing may be conducted by overfeeding the biconstituent yarn and the companion yarn through an air jet texturing machine at different speeds to create a bulkier yarn entangled at nodes along the end. Core spinning is a process where a staple yarn is spun and wrapped around a core yarn to cover the core yarn. Mechanical covering is a process where a continuous yarn is mechanical wrapped around a core yarn. If the yarns are combined by covering, either the biconstituent yarn or the companion yarn may be used to wrap the other yarn. However, to maximize stretch potential, it is preferable to use the biconstituent as the core yarn. Combining can also be accomplished by the serial process of false twist texturing a hard yarn followed by co-entangling with the biconstituent yarn prior to package winding., 66543=Polyesters functionalized with maleic anhydride (\u201cMA\u201d) could also be used as adhesion-promoting additives. For, example, poly(butylene terephthalate) (\u201cPBT\u201d) can be functionalized with MA by free radical grafting in a twin screw extruder, according to J. M. Bhattacharya, Polymer International (August, 2000), 49: 8, pp. 860-866, incorporated by reference herein, who also reported that a few weight percent of the resulting PBT-g-MA was used as a compatibilizer for binary blends of poly(butylene terephthalate) with nylon 66 and poly(ethylene terephthalate) with nylon 66. For example, such an additive could be used to adhere more firmly (co)polyamide wings to a (co)polyetherester core of the fiber of the present invention., 72739=The filaments are optionally treated with a finish, such as silicone oil optionally with magnesium stearate using any known technique at a finish applicator 60 as shown in FIG. 5. These filaments are then drawn, after quenching, so that they exhibit at least about 20% after boil-off stretch. The filaments may be drawn in at least one drawing step, for example between a feed roll 80 (which can be operated at 150 to 1000 meters/minute) and a draw roll 90 shown schematically in FIG. 5 to form a drawn filament 100. The drawing step can be coupled with spinning to make a fully-drawn yarn or, if a partially oriented yarn is desired, in a split process in which there is a delay between spinning and drawing. Drawing can also be accomplished during winding the filaments as a warp of yarns; called \u201cdraw warping\u201d by those skilled in the art. Any desired draw ratio, (short of that which interferes with processing by breaking filament) can be imparted to the filament, for example, a fully oriented yarn can be produced by a draw ratio of about 3.0 to 4.5 times, and a partially oriented yarn produced by a draw ratio of about 1.2-3.0 times. Herein, draw ratio is the draw roll 90 peripheral speed divided by the feed roll 80 peripheral speed. Drawing can be carried out at about 15-100\ufffd C., typically about 15-40\ufffd C., 108782=In a second method, the biconstituent yarn in its hard yarn configuration is spun separately and spooled from a production package directly into the spinning process of the companion yarn. The biconstituent yarn is entangled with the companion yarn by the intermingling jet of the second yarn process. The hetero-composite yarn so formed is wound onto a single yarn package. Typical wind up speed can be about 1500 to about 4000 meters per minute., 70294=The fibers of the invention can be in the form of continuous filament (either a multifilament yarn or a monofilament) or staple (including for example tow or spun yarn). The drawn fibers of the invention can have a denier per fiber of from about 1.5 to about 60 (about 1.7-67 dtex). Fully drawn fibers of the invention with polyamide wing typically have tenacities of about 1.5 to 3.0 g/dtex, and fibers with polyester wing, about 1-2.5 g/dtex, depending on wing/core ratios., 24286=This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/325,619 filed Sep. 28, 2001., 65411=As another example, a thermoplastic novolac resin, for example HRJ12700 (Schenectady International), having a number average molecular weight in the range of about 400 to about 5000, could be added to an elastomeric (co)polyetherester core to improve its adhesion to (co)polyamide wings. The amount of novolac resin should be in the range of 1-20 wt %, with a more preferred range of 2-10 wt %. Examples of the novolac resins useful herein include, but are not limited to, phenol-formaldehyde, resorcinol-formaldehyde, p-butylphenol-formaldehyde, p-ethylphenol-formaldehyde, p-hexylphenol-formaldehyde, p-propylphenol-formaldehyde, p-pentylphenol-formaldehyde, p-octylphenol-formaldehyde, p-heptylphenol-formaldehyde, p-nonylphenol-formaldehyde, bisphenol-A-formaldehyde, hydroxynapthaleneformaldehyde and alkyl-(such as t-butyl-) phenol modified ester (such as penterythritol ester) of rosin (particularly partially maleated rosin). See allowed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/384,605, filed Aug. 27, 1999 for examples of techniques to provide improved adhesion between copolyester elastomers and polyamide., 111363=Stretch properties (after boil-off stretch, after boil-off shrinkage and stretch recovery after boil-off) of the fibers prepared in the Examples below were determined as follows. A 5000 denier (5550 dtex) skein was wound on a 54 inch (137 cm) reel. Both sides of the looped skein were included in the total denier. Initial skein lengths with a 2 gram weight (length CB) and with a 1000 gram weight (0.2 g/denier) (length LB) were measured. The skein was subjected to 30 minutes in 95\ufffd C. water (\u201cboil off\u201d), and initial (after boil off) lengths with a 2 gram weight (length CAinitial) and with a 1000 gram weight (length LAinitial) were measured. After measurement with the 1000 gram weight, additional lengths were measured with a 2 gram weight after 30 seconds (length CA30 sec) and after 2 hours (length CA2 hrs). Shrinkage after boil-off was calculated as 100\ufffd(LB\u2212LA)/LB. Percent after boil-off stretch was calculated as 100\ufffd(LA\u2212CA@30 sec)/CA@30 sec. Recovery after boil-off was calculated as 100\ufffd(LA\u2212CA2 hrs)/(LA\u2212CAinitial)., 96576=When the hetero-composite yarn of the present invention has low denier, it may be used for making fine fabrics, while a yarn having high denier may be used for heavier fabrics. Accordingly, the yarn of the present invention may have any yarn denier suitable for its final end use product. For fine fabrics, the yarn may have a sum denier of the combination of the biconstituent denier and the companion yarn of less than about 60, preferably less than about 50, and more preferably, less than about 40 to as low as 10 denier. For medium weight fabrics, the hetero-composite yarn may have a denier of between about 50 to about 200, preferably about 70 to about 150, and more preferably about 70 to about 140. For heavier fabrics, such as load-bearing fabrics, the hetero-composite yarn may have a denier of between about 200 to about 2400, preferably about 200 to about 2000., 45661=For maximum cross-sectional radial symmetry, the core can have a substantially circular or a regular polyhedral cross-section, e.g., as seen in FIGS. 1-4. By \u201csubstantially circular\u201d it is meant that the ratio of the lengths of two axes crossing each other at 90\ufffd in the center of the fiber cross-section is no greater than about 1.2:1. The use of a substantially circular or regular polyhedron core, in contrast to the cores of U.S. Pat. No. 4,861,660, can protect the elastomer from contact with the rolls, guides, etc. as described later with reference to the number of wings. The plurality of wings can be arranged in any desired manner around the core, for example, discontinuously as depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, i.e., the wing polymer does not form a continous mantel on the core, or with adjacent wing(s) meeting at the core surface, e.g., as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5 of U.S. Pat. No. 3,418,200. The wings can be of the same or different sizes, provided a substantially radial symmetry is preserved. Further, each wing can be of a different polymer from the other wings, once again provided substantially radial geometric and polymer composition symmetry is maintained. However, for simplicity of manufacture and ease of attaining radial symmetry, it is preferred that the wings be of approximately the same dimensions, and be made of the same polymer or blend of polymers. It is also preferred that the wings discontinuously surround the core for ease of manufacture., 109549=In a fourth method a two-stage or optionally, an integrated single-stage process is used. Here the biconstituent yarn and the companion yarn are partially drawn (e.g., both yarns are partially oriented yarns (POY)) during their production and both yarns combined and entangled by use of the intermingling jet of the companion yarn process. Intermingling speed could be accomplished by e.g., second spinning speeds at a feed roll of about 600 to about 1000 meter per minute and wound up after drawing at wind up speeds of about 2000 to about 4000 meters per minute., 93442=Where the companion yarn is a single component drawn yarn, it has been found that yarns having less than about 80% elongation to break, preferably less than about 60% elongation to break, more preferably less than about 50% elongation to break, measured using standard ASTM intron technique D2256 (or TRL-TM1356) are particularly useful for the present invention.}",
