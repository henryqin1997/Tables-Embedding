The revision is part of our ongoing effort to make our rules easier to understand for those persons affected by the rules and other interested persons and organizations. We are also adding new procedures for imposing special conditions for sex offenders, and filling a gap left by an earlier rule change in 2003 regarding the administrative appeals that may be filed by District of Columbia offenders on supervised release., 149113=The Department of Justice, through its component, EOUST, is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking (Rule) pursuant to Section 602 of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA). The BAPCPA requires the Department to issue rules requiring uniform periodic reports (Periodic Reports) by debtors in possession or trustees in cases under chapter 11 of title 11. The BAPCPA requires the Rule to strike the best achievable practical balance between the reasonable needs of the public for information about the operational results of the Federal bankruptcy system, undue burden, and appropriate privacy concerns and safeguards., 7723=This rule amends the Department's regulations under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d). The regulations have been revised to update and streamline the language of several procedural provisions and to incorporate changes brought about by the amendments to the FOIA under the OPEN Government Act of 2007. Additionally, the regulations have been updated to reflect developments in the case law and to include current cost figures to be used in calculating and charging fees., 73837=The Department of Justice (the Department or DOJ) published a proposed rule in the Federal Register on March 26, 2015 (80 FR 15951), which added a new section to the Department's Privacy Act exemption regulations to exempt a DOJ-wide system of records from certain subsections of the Privacy Act. The heading of the document referenced \u201cCPCLO Order No. 004-2014\u201d when the Chief Privacy and Civil Liberties Order (CPCLO) number should read 004-2015. This document corrects the CPCLO number., 111380=In this document, the Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) proposes to amend its rules on Good Conduct Time (GCT) and Literacy. The purpose of this proposed rule is to provide effective literacy programming alternatives to the General Educational Development (GED) program that more effectively meet the specialized needs of inmates. This will also have the added benefit of reducing lengthy waiting lists for the GED program. This proposed rule will exempt inmates from the \u201csatisfactory progress\u201d provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (VCCLEA) and/or the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) if they participate in an \u201cauthorized alternative adult literacy program.\u201d The Bureau's Literacy Program rules, which currently contemplate only GED attainment, would also be revised to allow for \u201cauthorized alternative adult literacy programs.\u201d This change means that inmates participating in \u201cauthorized alternative adult literacy programs\u201d will not need to demonstrate satisfactory progress toward earning a GED credential to be considered for the full benefits of GCT. Other than the change regarding inmates in \u201cauthorized alternative adult literacy programs,\u201d we propose no further substantive changes., 158816=On August 1, 2014, the Department of Justice published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register in order to propose amendments to its Americans with Disabilities Act title III regulation to require the provision of closed movie captioning and audio description to give persons with hearing and vision disabilities access to movies. The comment period is scheduled to close on September 30, 2014. The Department of Justice is extending the comment period until December 1, 2014 in order to provide additional time for the public to prepare comments., 61154=Title 28 published on 2014-07-01, 36753=This joint interim final rule implements for all Federal award-making agencies the final guidance Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on December 26, 2013. This rule is necessary in order to incorporate into regulation and thus bring into effect the Uniform Guidance as required by OMB. Implementation of this guidance will reduce administrative burden and risk of waste, fraud, and abuse for the approximately $600 billion per year awarded in Federal financial assistance. The result will be more Federal dollars reprogrammed to support the mission, new entities able to compete and win awards, and ultimately a stronger framework to provide key services to American citizens and support the basic research that underpins the United States economy.}",
