They also have numerous act ivities throughout the year. They are a fairly small school and like to keep their students busy. Classes end each day at 4:00 so students can be involved in other non-academic activities if they choose., 182367=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 164984=Many students in Lehigh go out during the weekend for parties. If you do not want to go to those parties, Lehigh's After the Dark program offers activities during Friday night and during the weekend. There are also other activities during the weekday such as Make and Take, which you make something, depends on the theme of the week and take it with you after you are done. One of the biggest events in Lehigh is the Lehigh-Lafayette football game taken place in the Yankee Stadium in November of each year. It is a tradition for the two schools and many students will stay in New York during the weekend of the game., 140020=Lehigh has the most played college rivalry in the country (2014 is the 150th game!) So the week leading up to the Lehigh-Lafayette game is filled with contests, parties, concerts and bed races!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Students state greeks are a big deal. Great for these types of students If you'd like to party and still graduate from a top ranked school i guess you could do it here. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus Apparently the Lafayatte versus Lehigh rivalry is one of the oldest in the country. In the gym was a countdown clock to the next match up against the rival school. Bang for the buck This school is way too over-priced. Its the same as many ivy league schools but many employers and job recruiters I spoke with aren't impressed with the school's reputation. The best part about the price is that when I began taking to my dad and several of his engineering friends about the school all they could say was Lee-who? What to do for fun The students at this campus openly admitted to partying. One mechanical engineering senior and sorirty member stated that parties could be found from Tuesday to Saturday. This was done in front of my parents. Really smooth champs. Food and Dining Its college food Dorm Life",
