(1992) both incorporated herein by reference).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{78003=In an effort to control the undesirable growth of contaminating bacteria in liquid culture bottles derived from biological specimens that had been processed by the methods of Thornton WO 95/27076 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,749, the inventor supplemented standard antimicrobial formulations (i.e., PANTA) with a third generation cephalosporin, ceftazidime (CAS\ufffd No. 72558-82-8). The inventor surprisingly and unexpectedly found that when C18-carboxypropylbetaine (CB-18) was employed as the processing reagent as per Thornton WO 95/27076 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,749, and used in combination with this antimicrobial formulation there was a marked and dramatic loss in liquid culture sensitivity. In seeking to maintain the advantages in diagnostic sensitivity provided by Thornton WO 95/27076 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,749 the inventor undertook studies to characterize and negate this loss in liquid culture sensitivity. These studies resulted in methods and compositions wherein the sensitivity of the mycobacteria to antibiotics, especially the \u03b2-lactam family of antibiotics, could be altered using the betaine-like compounds of Thornton WO 95/27076 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,749. The methods are useful for characterizing and altering the susceptibility of bacteria, especially the mycobacteria, and most especially M. tuberculosis complex bacteria, to antimicrobial compounds, and as adjuvants to antimicrobial therapy., 303242=The reversal in liquid-solid culture sensitivity among CB-18 processed specimens (Table 6) suggested that the dichotomy was a result of the combination of CB-18 with the antibiotics in the PANTA/ceftazidime supplement. For example, comparing the solid culture sensitivity of smear positive and smear negative specimens of the two different processing methods showed a marked similarity. Solid media sensitivity among smear positive specimens was 34% higher than smear negative specimens when processed by NALC/NaOH, and 39% higher when processed by CB-18. The same examination of the liquid culture data showed a minor difference in sensitivity between smear positive and smear negative specimens when processed by NALC/NaOH (e.g., a 4% difference), but a striking difference among the same group processed by CB-18 (e.g., a 65% difference). The 75% liquid culture sensitivity among smear positive specimens processed by CB-18 was unexpected and highly unusual (these 14 specimens consisted of 5-MTB and 9-MOTT: 4-MAC 2-M. fortuitum, and 1 each of M. chelonae, M. szulgai, and M. kansasii.) The 100% sensitivity of liquid culture for NALC/NaOH processed specimens that were smear positive was not serendipitous. Stone, B. L. et al, Jour. Clin. Micro. 35:1030\u20131031 (1997) report that the liquid culture sensitivity of smear positive specimens (processed by NALC/NaOH) was also 99.3% (this was a much larger study: n=439)., 126900=By \u201cclinical isolate\u201d is meant a purified strain of a bacterial agent that causes infection, such clinical isolate being derived from a patient infected with such infectious agent. One or more clinical isolates could be derived from the same patient, or the same isolate might be derived from different patients, such as is seen during nosocomial outbreaks (Pittet, D. et al., Archives of Internal Medicine 155:1177\u20131184, (1995)). Such clinical isolates are typically purified by a combination of specimen processing and culture methods. As such these clinical isolates are viable and, therefore, available for further analysis and testing with respect to susceptibility to antibiotics in an in vitro assay such as a susceptibility test. Procedures for purifying these clinical isolates include methods and procedures known in the art, especially those described by Kent, P. T. et al, \u201cPublic Health Mycobacteriology: A Guide for the Level III Laboratory\u201d, US Department of Health and Human Service, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga. (1985) pp. 31\u201370, and Nolte, F. S. et al., In: Murray, P. R. et al., eds. Manual of Clinical Microbiology, ASM Press, Washington, D.C. (1995) pp. 400\u2013437, for the isolation of Mycobacterium, or the methods outlined by Clarridge, J. E. et al., In: Murray, P. R. et al., eds.

(1995) pp. 379\u2013399 for the isolation of Corynebacterium and Nocardia, respectively (all incorporated herein by reference)., 210870=Antibiotics differ with respect to their site of action. For example, Yao, J. D. C. et al., In: Murray, P. R. et al., eds. Manual of Clinical Microbiology, ASM Press, Washington, D.C. (1995) pp. 1281\u20131307 review the different classes of antibacterial agents and report that the range in the sites of action vary from affecting or interfering with different aspects of cell wall and cell membrane synthesis or integrity, protein synthesis, nucleic acids synthesis (e.g., both RNA and DNA precursors), and DNA replication, as well as drugs that simply facilitate mutagenesis., 152722=Examples of the most useful carboxybetaines that utilize a methylene bridge (\u201ccarboxymethylbetaines\u201d: R4=\u2014CH2\u2014), or a methylene linkage (\u03b1=\u2014CH2\u2014), and that vary based solely on alkyl chain length are: C10 (CAS\ufffdNo. 2644-45-3), C11 (CAS\ufffdNo. 2956-38-9), C12 (CAS\ufffdNo. 683-10-3), C13 (CAS\ufffdNo. 23609-76-9), C14 (CAS\ufffdNo. 2601-33-4), C15 (CAS\ufffdNo. 23609-77-0), C16 (CAS\ufffdNo. 693-33-4), and C18 (CAS\ufffdNo. 820-66-6). There is a C12-carboxymethylbetaine (CAS\ufffdNo. 6232-16-2) example that is N,N diethyl (R3=R4=\u2014CH2CH3); and an example in which the alkyl has a double bond: C18:1 (CAS\ufffdNo. 871-37-4). Examples of the most useful carboxybetaines that utilize an ethyl bridge (\u201ccarboxyethylbetaine\u201d: R4=\u2014CH2CH2\u2014), a methylene linkage (\u03b1=\u2014CH2\u2014), and vary based solely on alkyl chain length include: C12 (CAS\ufffdNo. 16527-85-8), C13 (CAS\ufffdNo. 132621-79-5), C14 (CAS\ufffdNo. 69725-38-3), C16 (CAS\ufffdNo. 42416-43-3), and C18 (CAS\ufffdNo. 30612-73-8). An example of a carboxyethylbetaine in which R2 and R3 are hydrogen atoms, under the appropriate conditions, is CAS\ufffdNo. 1462-54-0 (C12-beta alanine). Examples of the most useful carboxybetaines that utilize a propyl bridge (\u201ccarboxypropylbetaine\u201d: R4=\u2014CH2CH2CH2\u2014), a methylene linkage (\u03b1=\u2014CH2\u2014), and vary based solely on alkyl chain length include: C11 (CAS\ufffdNo. 150147-53-8), C12 (CAS\ufffdNo. 15163-30-1), C14 (CAS\ufffdNo. 146959-90-2), C15 (CAS\ufffdNo. 146959-91-3), C16 (CAS\ufffdNo. 71695-32-4), and C18 (CAS\ufffdNo. 78195-27-4). An example of a useful carboxybetaine that utilizes a butyl bridge (\u201ccarboxybutylbetaine\u201d: R4=\u2014CH2CH2CH2CH2\u2014), and a methylene linkage (\u03b1=\u2014CH2\u2014), is: C12 (CAS\ufffdNo. 120139-51-7). Two examples of the most useful carboxybetaines that utilize a pentyl bridge (\u201ccarboxypentylbetaine\u201d: R4=CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2\u2014), and a methylene linkage (\u03b1=\u2014CH2\u2014), is: C12 (CAS\ufffdNo. 76392-97-7), and C16 (CAS\ufffdNo. 73565-98-7). An example of a useful carboxybetaine that utilizes a hexyl bridge (\u201ccarboxyhexylbetaine\u201d: R4=\u2014CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2\u2014), and a methylene linkage (\u03b1=\u2014CH2\u2014), is: C12 (CAS\ufffdNo. 132621-80-8). There are several carboxybetaine examples in which a benzyl group is used as the bridge function (R4=\u2014CH2\u2014C6H4\u2014). There are two C12 examples, one in which the carboxy function is in the 4, or para, position (CAS\ufffdNo. 71695-31-3), and one in which the carboxy function is in the 2, or ortho, position (CAS\ufffdNo. 71695-34-6). There are two C16 examples, one in which the carboxy function is in the 4, or para, position (CAS\ufffdNo. 71695-33-5), and one in which the carboxy function is in the 2, or ortho, position (CAS\ufffdNo. 71695-35-7). Therefore, \u201ccarboxybetaine-like\u201d (\u201cCB-like\u201d) not only includes those structures that utilize a carboxyl group as the anion (\u03b3=\u2014COO\u2296 as defined in WO 95/27076 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,749, but most especially refers to those betaine-like structures that are shown in Table 1, and shall include all possible combinations of R1, \u03b1, R2, R3, \u03b2, and R4, as hereinbefore defined., 150158=Examples of CB-like detergents, but not limited to, are: N-(carboxymethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-1-hexadecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 693-33-4), cococarboxymethylbetaine and (CAS\ufffdNo. 68424-94-2), N-(carboxymethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-9-octadecenyl-1-minium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 871-37-4), N-(carboxymethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-3-((1-oxooctadecyl)amino)-1-propanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 6179-44-8), 3-amino -N(carboxymethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-1-propanaminium C8\u2013C22 acyl derivatives, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 84082-44-0), N-(carboxymethyl)-3-((12-hydroxy-1-oxo-9-octadecenyl)amino) -N,N-dimethyl-1-propanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 71850-81-2), cocoamidopropyl carboxymethylbetaine (CAS\ufffdNo. 61789-39-7 and CAS\ufffdNo. 61789-40-0), N-(2-carboxyethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecanarninium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 16527-85-8), N-(2-carboxyethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-1-tridecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 132621-79-5), N-(2-carboxyethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-1-tetradecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 69725-38-3), N-(2-carboxyethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-1-hexadecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 42416-43-3), N-(2-carboxyethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-1-octadecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 30612-73-8), N -dodecyl-beta-alanine (CAS\ufffdNo. 1462-54-0), N-(3-carboxypropyl)-N,N-dimethyl-1-undecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 150147-53-8), N-(3-carboxypropyl)-N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 15163-30-1), N-(3-carboxypropyl)-N,N-dimethyl-1-tetradecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 146959-90-2), N-(3-carboxypropyl)-N,N-dimethyl -1-pentadecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 146959-91-3), N-(3-carboxypropyl)-N,N -dimethyl-1-hexadecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo.71695-32-4), N-(3-carboxypropyl) -N,N-dimethyl-1-octadecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 78195-27-4), N-(4-carboxybutyl) -N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 120139-51-7), N-(5-carboxypentyl) -N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 76392-97-7), N-(5-carboxypentyl) -N,N-dimethyl-1-hexadecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 73565-98-7), N-(6-carboxyhexyl) -N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 132621-80-8), 4-carboxy-N -dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-benzenemethanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 71695-31-3), 2-carboxy-N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-benzenemethanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 71695-34-6), 4-carboxy-N-hexadecyl-N,N-dimethyl-benzenernethanaminium, inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 71695-33-5), 2-carboxy-N-hexadecyl-N,N-dimethyl-benzenemethanaminium inner salt (CAS\ufffdNo. 71695-35-7), tallow glycinate (CAS\ufffdNo. 70750-46-8), soyamidopropyl carboxymethylbetaine, and babassuamidopropyl carboxymethylbetaine., 162808=Examples of the diseases and conditions in which various mycobacterial species are present and that can be treated according to the invention include especially tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis complex), leprosy (M. leprae (human leprosy) and M. lepraemurium (rodent leprosy)), bird diseases caused by Mycobacterium avium complex bacteria, opportunistic and superinfections of AIDS patients and others by M. avium (Nightingale, S. D. et al., Jour. Infect. Dis. 165:1082\u20131085 (1992)), and any infections due to a specific mybacterial agent such as, for example, M. bovis (of special importance in veterinary medicine), M. fortuitum (a soil bacterium that has been isolated from lesions in animals and humans), M. intracellulare (an opportunistic infection especially seen in patients infected with the AIDS virus), M. paratuberculosis (especially of interest in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease (regional ileitis) in humans), Mycobacterium kansasii (is a rare but devastating agent, generally associated with pulmonary disease, Mycobacterium marinum (which infects cold-blooded animals and fish; it has also been isolated from superficial granulomas on the extremities of humans), Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (the causative agent of johne's disease in cattle; it is very slow growing and cultures must be held for 16 weeks before it can be assured that they are negative), and M. ulcerans (the cause of Buruli ulcer). Many of the above and others have been discussed by Wayne, L. G. et al., Clin. Micro. Rev. 5:1\u201325 (1992), and Falkinham, O., Clin. Micro. Rev. 9:177\u2013215 (1996) both incorporated herein by reference., 213026=Treatment of mycobacterial infections is severely limited (supra), more so than most microorganisms (Inderlied, C. B. et al., In: Murray, P. R. et al., eds. Manual of Clinical Microbiology, ASM Press, Washington, D.C. (1995) pp. 1385\u20131404). This insensitivity is due in part to the impermeable nature of this class of bacteria: the mycobacteria are 1,000 to 10,000 fold less permeable than Escherichia coli (Jarlier, V., et al., Jour. Bact. 172:1418\u20131423 (1990) and Nikaido, H., et al., Res. Microbiol. 142:437\u2013443 (1991)). Connell, N. D. et al. In: Tuberculosis, Pathogenesis, Protection, and Control. Bloom, B. R. ed. ASM Press, Washington, D.C. (1994) pp. 333\u2013352 review the permeability characteristics of the mycobacteria and state that \u201cthe low permeability of the M. chelonae cell wall completely explains the level of resistance of this organism to cephalosporins.\u201d, 156495=In addition to the carboxybetaines, other readily available betaines useful in conjunction with the methods of the invention include the sulfobetaines, for example, the highly purified (i.e., research grade) \u201cSB\u201d-series of detergents and especially, SB-18 (N-octadecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane-sulfonate (CAS\ufffdNo. 13177-41-8)), SB-16 (N-hexadecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane-sulfonate (CAS\ufffdNo. 2281-11-0)), SB-14 (N-tetradecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane-sulfonate (CAS\ufffdNo. 14933-09-6)), and SB-12 (N-dodecyldecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane-sulfonate (CAS\ufffdNo.14933-08-5))., 69611=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/429,614, filed Oct. 29, 1999 (allowed Jan. 7, 2002) now U.S. Pat. No. 6,406,880, which is a continuation of PCT/US98/08760, filed May 1, 1998, which claims the priority of U.S. application Ser. No. 60/045,512, filed May 2, 1997, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference., 116331=By \u201cantibiotic\u201d is meant any of the compounds known in the art that have a deleterious effect on the viability, integrity, infectivity or competence of an infectious agent, as understood in the art (see: Murray, P. R. et al., eds. Manual of Clinical Microbiology, ASM Press, Washington, D.C. (1995) pp. 1281\u20131307 and 1385\u20131404; Kucers, A. et al., The Use of Antibiotics 4th ed J. B. Lippincott Co. Philadelphia, Pa. (1987); and Lorian, V. ed. Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine 2nd Edition, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md., all incorporated herein by reference). Examples of the different classes of antibiotics would include the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, the aminoglycosides and aminocyclitols, the quinolones, tetracyclines, macrolides, and lincosamides, as well as the glycopeptides, lipopeptides and polypeptides, the sulfonamides and trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, isoniazid, nitroimidazoles, rifampicins, nitrofurans, methenamine, and mupirocin, all of which would be useful in conjunction with the methods of the invention. The term antibiotic is synonymous with \u201cantimicrobial,\u201d \u201ctherapeutic,\u201d or \u201cdrug\u201d as used herein. All antibiotics are drugs or therapeutics, but not all drugs or therapeutics are antibiotics., 426340=The gold standards in tuberculosis susceptibility testing are the BACTEC\ufffd S.I.R.E or BACTEC\ufffd PZA tests (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.). This is an automated broth method (Snider, D. E., et al., Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 123:402\u2013406 (1981); Siddiqi, S. H., et al., Jour. Clin. Micro. 13:908\u2013912 (1981); Vincke, G., et al. Jour. Antimicrob. Chemther. 10:351\u2013354 (1982); Roberts, G. D., et al., Jour. Clin. Micro. 18:689\u2013696 (1983); and Tarrand, J. J., et al., Jour. Clin. Micro. 21:941\u2013946 (1985)). Product labeling states that after the control growth index (GI) exceeds 30 (GIt=0), the bottle is read the following day (GIt+1) and the difference between these two days is determined (GIt+1-GIt=\u0394GIcontrol). The bottles with test drugs are read on these same two days and the \u0394GIdrug for the drug is determined in the same manner. If \u0394GIcontrol>>\u0394GIdrug then the isolate is considered sensitive. If \u0394GIcontrol\u2267\u0394GIdrug then the isolate is considered borderline. If \u0394GIcontrol<\u0394GIdrug then the isolate is considered resistant. Heifets L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemo. 40:1759\u20131767 (1996) states that the GI in the presence of the drug should not exceed 50 during 8 days of cultivation (when the inoculum was between 104 and 105 cfu/ml in the drug containing bottles.), 76760=The most common and best characterized class of antibiotic compounds is by far the \u03b2-lactams. Due to the depth and breadth of these antibiotics, the ability to treat mycobacterial infections with these agents would provide significant advantages. Application of the \u03b2-lactams in therapeutic regimes designed to treat mycobacterial infections has been tried with limited success (Chambers, H. F. et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemo. 39:2620\u20132624 (1995)). The ability to broaden the susceptibility of the mycobacteria, especially to the \u03b2-lactams by addressing resistance mechanisms, has significant potential in effectively treating mycobacterial infections., 424667=Tsubone K., Jour. Pharm. Sci. 80:1051\u20131054 (1991) has shown that in general there is little or no correlation between the chelating activity of different phosphobetaines and antimicrobial activity. This is consistent with the observation that the CB-18 effect is not a consequence of chelating metal ions., 395418=Table 10 summarizes the detergents examined and the results thereof The following detergents were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, Wis.): benzyldimethyl-stearyl ammonium chloride (Cat.#: 22,901-6), benzyldimethyl-tetradecyl ammonium chloride (Cat.#: 29,279-6), and octadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (Cat.#: 35,924-6). The following detergents were obtained from the Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, Mo.): mixed alkyltrimethyl amonium bromide (Cat.#: M-7635), palmitic acid (Cat.#: P-0500), stearic acid (Cat.#: S4751), CHAPS (Cat.#: C-3023), deoxycholic acid (Cat.#: D-6750), SB-18 (C18-sulfopropylbetaine) (Cat.#: 0\u20138004), Brij 97 (oleyl-(poyoxyethylene)10) (Cat.#: P-6136), and Brij 56 (cetyl-(poyoxyethylene)10) (Cat.#: P-5759).

Mackamine O2 (oleamine oxide) was obtained as a sample from the McIntyre Group, LTD. (University Park, Ill.)., 75359=Other mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. paratuberculosis, M. ulcerans, M. leprae, M. kansasii, and M. fortuitum complex are common pathogens as well (see: Wayne, L. G. Clin. Micro. Rev. 5:1\u201325 (1992) or Falkinham, J. O. Clin. Micro. Rev. 9:177\u2013215 (199) for reviews of the different mycobacterial pathogens). MAC causes disseminated disease in almost half of all late stage AIDS patients (Nightingale, S. D. et al., Jour. Infect. Dis. 165:1082\u20131085 (1992)). The World Health Organization estimates that by the year 2000 the number of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) could exceed 40 million (World Health Organization (document WHO/GPA/CNP/EVA/93.1) Global Programme on AIDS (1993)). M. paratuberculosis (a subspecies of M. avium) causes Johne's disease in ruminants. It has been estimated that Johne's disease costs the U.S. farming industries (e.g., diary and beef) in excess of $1.5 billion annually due to lower productivity and fecundity (Whitlock, R. Proceedings of the Third International Colloquium on Paratuberculosis, pp. 514\u2013522 (1991); Whitlock, R. et al, Proceedings of the 89th Annual Meeting of the United States Animal Health Association, pp. 484\u2013490 (1985)). Mycobacterial diseases extract an enormous social cost., 128626=By \u201cinfectious agent\u201d is meant an infectious microorganism, especially an infectious bacterium as understood in the art. Infectious agents of special interest according to the methods of the invention include those that contain mycolic acid structures, for example, the mycobacteria, and most especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex bacteria, that cause disease (Isenberg, H. D. et al., In: Murray, P. R. et al., eds. Manual of Clinical Microbiology, ASM Press, Washington, D.C. 1995 pp 5\u201318 (incorporated herein by reference)). A human or animal patient having a disease caused by such an infectious agent is said to have an \u201cinfection\u201d caused by such an agent, or to be \u201cinfected with\u201d such agent. An infectious agent that causes disease is said to be \u201cpathogenic.\u201d Bacteria that are typically not pathogenic, and part of the patient's normal bacterial flora, are said to be saprophytic. Under some circumstances, such as when the patient is immune compromised or immune suppressed (e.g., being infected with BFV, or having AIDS complex, or after having undergone an organ transplant), such saprophytic microorganisms can cause infection. A patient can be infected with one or more infectious agents., 114015=By a microorganism, such as a clinical isolate or infectious agent, being \u201csusceptible\u201d is meant that the microorganism, (for example, a Mycobacterium), is deleteriously affected by an antibiotic in such a manner that such clinical isolate or infectious agent is rendered incompetent, noninfectious or non-viable as understood in the art (Yao, J. D. C. et al., In: Murray, P. R. et al., eds. Manual of Clinical Microbiology, ASM Press, Washington, D.C. (1995) pp. 1281\u20131307 (incorporated herein by reference)). Susceptible, as used herein, is synonymous with \u201csusceptibility.\u201d When a microorganism, such as a clinical isolate or infectious agent, is determined to be susceptible to a given antibiotic, the antibiotic is said to have \u201cactivity\u201d against, or be \u201cactive\u201d against such isolate or infectious agent., 126538=By \u201cSB-16\u201d is meant N-hexadecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane-sulfonate (CAS\ufffdNo. 2281-11-0)., 74454=Tuberculosis is the most prevalent infectious disease in the world today, infecting approximately one-third of the world's population, some 1.7 billion people (Kochi, A. Tubercle 72:1\u20136 (1991)). In addition, tuberculosis kills more people worldwide (approximately 3 million annually) than any other single infectious disease (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 42:961\u2013964 (1993)). The vast majority of TB cases are in developing countries, however, multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of MTB (MDR-TB) have become a significant problem globally (World Health Organization (document WHO/TB/96.198) Groups at Risk. WHO Report on the Tuberculosis Epidemic 1996 (1996)). Unless something is done to stem the rise in MDR-TB, a return of the past where tuberculosis was the most common cause of death in both developing and industrialized countries is inevitable., 248806=(i) Mix 25 mls of analytical grade isopropanol (Baxter, McGaw Park, Ill., Cat. #: 3043-1 NY) with 25 mls of water in a graduated cylinder to prepare 50 mls of 1:1, isopropanol:water (NOTE: use sterile, filtered water (e.g., GIBCO/BRL, Gaithersburg, Md., Cat. #: 15230-022))., 316434=In this experiment the 571/573-BAL isolate was cultivated on 7H11-selective media, serially diluted in NALC/citrate to approximately 1,000\ufffd. In an attempt to examine how the inoculum impacted the results of this assay three different stocks were manufactured, one series in buffer and one series in CB-18. Hence, further serial dilutions were made in either buffer or 1.0 MM CB-18 to 2,500\ufffd, 12,500\ufffd and 50,000\ufffd. The planting solutions were manufactured by mixing these three stocks 1:1 with either buffer or a buffered solution of lecithin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.; Cat.#: P 5394 (7.5% lecithin was made up as a 100\ufffd concentrate in 100% ethanol (3 grams in 40 mls) and diluted in the Tris buffer of Example 1 immediately prior to use)). The final dilutions of three different planting solutions were approximately 5000\ufffd, 25,000\ufffd, and 100,000\ufffd. The final concentration of CB-18 and lecithin in the appropriate planting solutions was approximately 0.5 mM. Each series was then planted in quadruplicate (400 \u03bcl each) in BACTEC 12B bottles supplemented with either reconstitution fluid (R.F.) or PANTA that had been supplemented with 8 \u03bcg/ml ceftazidime (P/caz). The final concentration of both lecithin and CB-18 during incubation was approximately 17 \u03bcg/ml. Bottles were checked periodically and the growth indices recorded. Growth indices in a given series were averaged and then plotted versus days in culture., 72441=Antibiotics exert their effect by interfering with a variety of cellular functions. For example, different classes of antibiotics are known to interfere with various aspects of cell wall synthesis, RNA/DNA synthesis, DNA replication, or protein synthesis. Bacteria are resistant to different antibiotics for a variety of reasons. Quintiliani, R. et al., In: Murray, P. R. et al., eds. Manual of Clinical Microbiology, ASM Press, Washington, D.C. (1995) pp. 1308\u20131326 review several of these resistence mechanisms and point out that the antibiotic must first enter the cell, and only then can it exert its effect at the site of action. The basis for resistence can either be due to the permeability of the organism, or the molecular configuration of the site of action might either be incompatible or nonexistent. In addition, the bacteria might modify, destroy or eliminate the agent., 420315=EDTA alters permeability in bacteria by extracting and chelating divalent metal cations that stabilize the cell wall structure. Rastogi, N. et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemo. 34:759\u2013764 (1990) reported that attempts to grow mycobacteria in 1 mM EDTA (372.5 \u03bcg/ml) had a significant impact on viability. Given that the betaines are salted-in based on their ability to coordinate water (Tsujii, K. et al., Jour. Phys. Chem. 82:1610\u20131614 (1978)), the possibility was raised that the CB-18 effect was a result of the chelating activity of this compound., 231349=A susceptibility assay according to the invention that opens the door to the use of \u03b2-lactams as therapeutic adjuvants in antituberculosis therapy is of significant utility because the most common and best characterized class of antibiotic compounds is by far the \u03b2-lactams. Due to the depth and breadth of these antibiotics, the ability to treat mycobacterial infections with these agents would provide significant advantages. Application of the \u03b2-lactams in therapeutic regimes designed to treat mycobacterial infections has been tried with limited success. For example, Chambers, H. F. et al., Antimicro. Agents Chemo. 39:2620\u20132624 (1995) examined five clinical isolates of MTB and tested several different classes of \u03b2-lactams. Most isolates were resistant to the penicillins and most of the cephalosporins; however, imipenem (a carbapenem) showed some activity. Combining almost all \u03b2-lactams with a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor was necessary to achieve significant susceptibility., 171530=By \u201c\u03b2-lactam\u201d is meant any of the penicillin, cephalosporin, monobactam and carbapenem antibiotics having as a component of its structure the \u03b2-lactam ring as understood in the art (Yao, J. D. C. et al., In: Murray, P. R. et al., eds. Manual of Clinical Microbiology, ASM Press, Washington, D.C. 1995 pp 1281\u20131286; Kucers, A. et al., The Use of Antibiotics 4th ed J. B. Lippincott Co. Philadelphia, Pa. (1987) pp. 3\u2013584). All \u03b2-lactams are useful in the methods of the invention., 211483=Bacteria are insensitive (i.e., resistant) to different antibiotics for a variety of reasons. Quintiliani, R. et al., In: Murray, P. R. et al., eds. Manual of Clinical Microbiology, ASM Press, Washington, D.C. (1995) pp. 1308\u20131326 (incorporated herein by reference) review several of these mechanisms. In summary, the antibiotic must first enter the cell and then exert its effect at the site of action. The basis for resistence can be due to: (a) the permeability of the organism, (b) the molecular configuration of the site of action might either be incompatible or simply nonexistent in a particular clinical isolate, or (c) the bacteria might modify, destroy or pump the antibiotic from the intracellular space. In the first case, if the bacterium is impermeable to the drug, then the antibiotic cannot reach the site of action to exert its influence. In the second instance, if the drug can enter the bacterium, but the site of action (e.g., the 3-D structure of the target site) is such that the antibiotic cannot bind, or if the site of action does not exist (e.g., the structure or enzyme in question is not a part of the expressed constituents), then the bacterium will be unaffected by the drug. In the last instance, if the antibiotic can enter, and the target does exist, then the bacterium can effectively evade the action of the drug by either degrading the antibiotic, modifying the antibiotic to reduce its toxicity, or removing/pumping the antibiotic from the intracellular environment., 225259=The concept that the CB-18 effect may be a result of alterations in the pattern of mycolic acid modifications is based in part on the work of Yuan, Y. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93:12828\u201312833 (1996) and is examined in detail in Example 9. In summary, modifications to mycolic acids can be directly related to cell wall fluidity. Certain modifications decrease cell wall fluidity, and a drop in cell wall fluidity can be correlated with a reduction in permeability. The low permeability of mycobacteria is thought to play a significant role in antimicrobial resistance (Yuan, Y. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 92:6630\u20136634 (1995); Brennan, P. J. et al., Annu. Rev. Biochem. 64:29\u201363 (1995)). Recall that Connell, N. D. et al. In: Tuberculosis, Pathogenesis, Protection, and Control, Bloom, B. R. ed. ASM Press, Washington, D.C. (1994) pp. 333\u2013352 attributed the resistance of M. chelonae to cephalosporins exclusively to permeability.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having now fully described the invention, it will be understood by those with skill in the art that the invention may be performed within a wide and equivalent range of conditions, parameters and the like, without affecting the spirit or scope of the invention or any embodiment thereof. Tuberculosis is primarily a respiratory infection. Tuberculous lesions typically appear in the upper lobes of the lungs. Given that the surface of the lungs are covered by a natural surfactant, an effective route of delivery of the betaine-like detergents to the site of infection can be similar to delivery of \u03b2-blockers or steroids in asthmatics. For example, some steroids and \u03b2-blockers are typically delivered in a microcrystalline form, such as Ventolin\ufffd (manufactured by Allen & Hanburys, a division of Glaxo, Research Triangle Park, N.C.). Standard methods of delivery of the betaine-like detergent(s) are known in the art and include ingestion, intramuscular injection, intravenous drip, injection at the site of infection, or inhalation. However, the betaine-like detergents are surface active agents that are likely to be not well tolerated by ingestion or intramuscular injection. For example, ingestion of large quantities of a betaine-like detergent would probably result in gastrointestinal distress, and injection of large quantities of betaine would probably result in solubilization of cellular structure, causing irritation at the injection site. When intravenous drip is used, care must be taken with respect to the concentration of",
