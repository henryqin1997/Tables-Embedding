            "Bridgewater is a fun, close-knit community focused on both academics and personal growth. Getting involved is essential, and there are tons of great student-run clubs and organizations in which to do so. Professors are friendly and try to develop close friendships with their students, which can be a great help and positive experience in your time at BC."

At Bridgewater you will be noticed. It is also great for people who want to be away from the hussle and bussle of city life. Tips for prospective students Bridgewater College is an ideal school. The campus is lovely, expecailly during the fall or spring/summer when colors are changing or things are starting to bloom. The professors are interested in your education and a small number of students in each class makes it easy to get involved and ask questions. The students are friendly and it is easy to get involved on activities on campus. Bang for the buck",
