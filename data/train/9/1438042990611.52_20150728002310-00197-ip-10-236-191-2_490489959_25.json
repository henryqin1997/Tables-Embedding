In Table 1, the following abbreviations are used for the monomers. AA is acrylic acid, MAA is methacrylic acid, EHA is 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, C4A is butyl acrylate, C6A is hexyl acrylate, CY6MA is cyclohexylmethacrylate, C6DA is hexyldiacrylate, C12A is dodecyl acrylate, C12DA is dodecyl diacrylate, C14A is tetradecyl acrylate, C16A is hexadecyl acrylate, and C22A is behenyl acrylate. The monomers were copolymerized in a suitable solvent, e.g. toluene or a mixture of heptane and butyl acetate or ethyl acetate, using a suitable initiator, e.g. azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN). For example, SCC11 was made by mixing the C6A and C14A with 0.31 parts of AIBN in a 4:1 mixture of heptane and ethyl acetate, and maintaining the mixture at 50\ufffd C. for 2 days, to give a product having a weight average molecular weight of about 970,000 and a Tp of about 1 2.5\ufffd C. SCC 5 was made by polymerizing the C22A alone, functionalizing the resulting homopolymer with isocyanatoethylmethyl methacrylate, and then polymerizing the other monomers with the functionalized homopolymer., 100111=The microporous base film can be modified by calendering at a nip pressure of 17.8 to 266.6 kg per linear cm (100 to 1500 pli). We have found that calendering the base film results in coated films which have reduced OTR values and increased R values. The base film can be uniaxially or biaxially calendered. The base film can also be stretched, uniaxially or biaxially., 110484=The properties of the membrane can be modified by calendering, uniaxially or biaxially, preferably at a nip pressure of 17.8 to 266.6 kg per linear cm (100 to 1500 pli). We have found that calendering reduces the OTR and increases the R ratio of the membrane., 80357=This application is a continuation of copending application Ser. No. 08/759,602, filed Dec. 5, 1996, by Raymond Clarke, Ray Stewart, Valentine Yoon, Donald Schultz and Bradley McClary. Ser. No. 08/759,602 is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/453,018, filed May 30, 1995, by Raymond Clarke, Ray Stewart, Valentine Yoon, Donald Schultz and Bradley McClary, now abandoned. This application is also a continuation of International Application number PCT/U.S. 96/07939, filed May 29, 1996, by Landec Corp., naming Raymond Clarke, Ray Stewart, Valentine Yoon, Donald Schultz and Bradley McClary as inventors. The entire disclosure of each of Ser. Nos. 08/453,108 and 08/759,602 and PCT/U.S. 96/0939 is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes., 195240=This example illustrates the effect of calendering the coated microporous film. The OTR and R values and the thicknesses of a coated microporous film made by coating SCC1 onto Teslin SP7 were measured before calendering, after uniaxial calendering at 142 kg/linear cm (800 pli) or after uniaxial calendering at 269 kg/linear cm (1500 pli). The results are shown in Table 5 below., 114801=The size of the containers can vary considerably. In one category, the container contains up to 2.26 kg (5 lb) of produce. In another category, the containers are much larger, e.g. containing up to 1500 lb (680 kg) of produce., 221261=Solutions of SCC 12 (C14A/C6A/MA, 80/15/5) in methyl ethyl ketone, 3% or 5%, were coated onto (a) Teslin SP7 or (b) Teslin SP7 whose pores had been partially blocked by coating with a solution PLV 2000 (30% in methyl ethyl ketone) followed by drying at 82\ufffd C. for 2 mins. The solutions and substrates used, and the OTR and R values of the resulting membranes are shown in Table 10 below.}",
