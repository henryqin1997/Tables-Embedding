GPA: 4.00/4.00 Thesis: Application of k-\u03b5 turbulence model for predicting drag reduction in Poiseuille flow with the use of polymer additives 1999 \u2192 2003 Azad University, Tehran, Iran B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. GPA: 3.42/4.00 Thesis: Application of all-variable speed technology in air conditioning systems with the purpose of saving energy Education I joined the Vehicle, Fuel, and Environment Research Institute (VFERI) due to my expertise in CFD. The project I was assigned about simulating a car engine from the intake to the exhaust pipe. My assignment was to improve mesh quality for complicated geometries of intake and exhaust valves, and implement parallelization of flow solver using MPI library.
