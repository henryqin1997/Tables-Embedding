In 1986, child care, kindergartens and parent co-operatives were all brought together under the Ministry of Education. As part of this reform, a three year diploma was established as the benchmark for licensing and New Zealand\u2019s first national early childhood curriculum, Te Whariki, was developed (1993, 1996)., 228600=Definitions: Kindergarten: similar to our junior kindergarten (must have attained the minimum age of four on or by Jan. 1 in the year of admission; full or half-day; ten hours a week; optional attendance)., 237085=Context: This curriculum originated when a small group of Flemish pre-school teachers and consultants began to reflect critically on their practice with particular attention to children as they seek ways to address the problems they meet.

Social Infants (birth to 24 months) Interactions are examples of adult-child communications, contacts and joint activity that support the child\u2019s accomplishment of the indicators and related skill development. The examples also describe why the example interactions are effective. Interactions Indicators are markers of what a child knows or does which show that the skill is emerging, being practised or being elaborated. Indicators are given in progression within each root skill. Early childhood practitioners observe children\u2019s behaviour and can use the indicators to identify the related skill, set goals and plan appropriate curriculum. Indicators Root skills are specific capacities, processes, abilities and competencies that exist within a domain. When adults understand and observe emerging skills, they can create individual strategies to support the practice and extension of the skill. A skill may appear in all four age groups, indicating pathways that emerge early and are elaborated over time. Attention to root skills supports children\u2019s learning in early childhood settings using different curricula. Root skills that emerge and are practised in the early years are important both in their own right and as foundations of later development. Pathways for learning, behaviour and health are constructed in the early years. The continuum identifies the root skills that predict later learning, behaviour and health. Root Skills A domain is a broad area or dimension of development. There are many ways to organize development into domains.
