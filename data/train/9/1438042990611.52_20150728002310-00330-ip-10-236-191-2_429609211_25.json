Although he did not make big scores in his early matches, he batted well and showed he has the temperament and technique to be a mainstay of the Kenyan side for many years. A confident and aggressive middle-order batsman, he is not afraid to attack and likes to dominate bowlers from the off. He failed in the 2007 World Cup, though, with just 37 runs in the three matches Kenya played as his impetuosity proved his downfall. In October 2007 he put his international career pretty much on hold when he opted to go to university in India.
