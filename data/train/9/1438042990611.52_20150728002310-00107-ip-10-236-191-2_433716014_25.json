In our paper, the evidence for exchange rate predictability at short horizons is not very strong. This finding may be a result of some assumptions we have used to simplify our computation. For instance, an -coverage forecast interval in our paper is always constructed using the and quantiles. Alternatively, we can choose quantiles that minimize the length of intervals, given the nominal coverage.22 In addition, the development of more powerful testing methods may also be helpful. The evidence of exchange rate predictability in Molodtsova and Papell (2009) is partly driven by the testing method recently developed by Clark and West (2006, 2007). We acknowledge that whether or not short-horizon results can be improved remains an interesting question, but do not pursue this in the current paper. The purpose of this paper is to show the connection between the exchange rate and economic fundamentals from an interval forecasting perspective. Predictability either at short- or long-horizons will serve this purpose.}",

Panel data are also found helpful in detecting exchange rate predictability, especially at long horizons. For instance, see Mark and Sul (2001), Engel, Mark, and West (2007), and Rogoff and Stavrakeva (2008). It would be interesting to incorporate these studies into interval forecasting.

Engel and West (2005) derive the exchange rate as a present-value asset price from a Taylor rule model. They also find a positive correlation between the model-based exchange rate and the actual real exchange rate between the US dollar and the Deutschmark (Engel and West, 2006). Mark (2007) examines the role of Taylor-rule fundamentals for exchange rate determination in a model with learning. In his model, agents use least-square learning rules to acquire information about the numerical values of the model's coefficients. He finds that the model is able to capture six major swings of the real Deutschmark-Dollar exchange rate from 1973 to 2005. Molodtsova and Papell (2009) find significant short-term out-of-sample predictability of exchange rates with Taylor-rule fundamentals for 11 out of 12 currencies vis-\u00e1-vis the U.S. dollar over the post-Bretton Woods period. Molodtsova, Nikolsko-Rzhevskyy, and Papell (2008a, 2008b) find evidence of out-of-sample predictability for the dollar/mark nominal exchange rate with forecasts based on Taylor rule fundamentals using real-time data, but not revised data. Chinn (forthcoming) also finds that Taylor rule fundamentals do better than other models at the one year horizon. With a present-value asset pricing model as discussed in Engel and West (2005), Chen and Tsang (2009) find that information contained in the cross-country yield curves are useful in predicting exchange rates.}",
