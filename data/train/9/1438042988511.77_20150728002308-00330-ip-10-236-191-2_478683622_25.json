In this embodiment the system 500 relies on software executing in microcontroller 502 to implement and emulate the system 500's functionality. In this embodiment software configures general purpose I/O lines to implement card reader interface 526, display interface 508, external peripheral interface 536, interactive interface 532, RAM/NOVRAM interface 546, vending equipment I/O 506, 516, 518, and or 520, and communication interface 548.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{439909=In block 1808 the MDB command message is encoded and forwarded or passed by way of the mimic MDB interface 516 to the coin mechanism. Processing then moves to block 1810., 507082=In block 2914 the computing platform 802 and or system 500 accounts for the VEND SUCCESS and or VEND FAILURE. VEND FAILURES typically end a session and or transaction., 359803=Further ease of integration can be achieved by implementing power converter 1020. Power converter 1020 converts input voltage obtained from the vending equipment's MDB bus via the vending machine interface 902. The output voltage from the power converter can be referred to as +VCC and can power the system 500 semiconductor 1002., 486989=In block 2710 when a user makes a vending selection the VMC sends by way of the MDB bus connection between system 500 and the VMC a MDB VEND REQUEST message. This message typically contains the column or button select by the user and the vending equipment price set for this item. The VEND REQUEST is reported to the system 500 and processing then moves to block 2708., 433841=In block 1648 the VEND REQUEST command is processed and a VEND APPROVED or VEND DENIED response message is data communicated from the system 500 to the requesting VMC. Processing moves to back to decision block 1632., 399153=In block 1914 the transaction authorization is declined and the routine is exited., 486500=In block 2706 the system 500 updates the MDB TRANSACTION STRING to reflect the operational state changes and pricing information. The MDB TRANSACTION STRING is available to an interconnected computing platform 802 through issue of appropriate MDB TRANSACTION STRING send commands, such as @<esc>H, and @<esc>V. A sample MDB TRANSACTION STRING could be \u2018S0001250000000000C\u2019, where an \u2018S\u2019 indicates a MDB STATE of IN-SESSION., 504373=In an exemplary embodiment, a computing platform 802 interconnect with system 500 can determine from the MDB TRANSACTION string the item selected and item price. For example and not limitation, the MDB TRANSACTION STRING \u2018S 000125 000115 0001 R\u2019 indicates that the MAX VEND PRICE in the vending equipment is \u2018000125\u2019 or $1.25, the price set in the vending equipment for the user item selected is \u2018000100\u2019 or $1.00, and the user selected item or column id \u20180001\u2019 item or column number is one. The computing platform 802 can in part use this information to determine whether to issue the VEND APPROVE, or VEND DENIED command to the system 500. Processing then moves to block 2910., 465353=In block 2316 the system 500 and the vending equipment VMC exchange setup and configuration MDB message data to arrive at the ENABLED state. Such MDB message data and requirements for the ENABLED state can be found in referring to the NAMA MDB/ICP INTERFACE PROTOCOL version 1.0 and version 2.0. Upon reaching the ENABLED state a report can be issues to a monitoring system 500 in block 2312. Processing then moves to block 2312., 459335=In block 2236 the transaction is ended. System 500 cancels any started vending sessions, a delay to wait for any last vend items is implemented, transaction records are updated and closed, and an optional transaction receipt can be printed. The routine is then exited., 386527=In block 2008 the base unit 700 wirelessly notifies the requesting system 500 that the telephone line is available and data communication between the requesting system 500 and the base unit 700 can begin. In addition, the base unit 700 notifies any other system 500 in wireless proximity to the base unit that the base unit 700 is currently unavailable. Processing then moves to block 2012., 420352=In block 1408 the vending equipment is enabled and vending can occur.
