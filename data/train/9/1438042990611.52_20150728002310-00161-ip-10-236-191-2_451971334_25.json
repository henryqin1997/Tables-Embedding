            "METHOD FOR VISUALLY MONITORING AN IRREVERSIBLE ELECTROPORATION TREATMENT, AND MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING APPARATUS WITH INTEGRATED ELECTROPORATION TREATMENT DEVICE - In a method for implementing an irreversible electroporation treatment with an electroporation device having at least two treatment electrodes, magnetic resonance exposures are acquired for visual monitoring of the treatment, and magnetic resonance-compatible electrodes are used as treatment electrodes. A magnetic resonance imaging apparatus has an electroporation device integrated therein, so as to be operable by co-use of at least some of the same components that arte used for image data acquisition.",
            "LOCAL GRADIENT SYSTEM FOR IMAGING OF THE BREAST WITH PLANAR ARRANGEMENT - A coil arrangement for a magnetic resonance tomography apparatus has plates that each contain at least one gradient coil.",
            "METHOD AND MAGNETIC RESONANCE SYSTEM TO MEASURE A SODIUM CONTENT IN TISSUE BY MEANS OF A MAGNETIC RESONANCE TECHNIQUE - In a magnetic resonance method and apparatus to measure a sodium content in tissue in a first slice, a determination of a blood volume in blood vessels in the first slice is made, and an MR acquisition sequence to acquire MR data of a sodium-23 magnetization from the first slice is implemented. A signal proportion of the MR data that originates from the sodium-23 magnetization in blood vessels is calculated based on the determined blood volume in tissue. This signal proportion is subtracted from a total signal of the MR data to obtain a corrected signal that is proportional to the sodium content in tissue. The sodium content in tissue is calculated from the corrected signal."
