            "Console Retainer with Integrated Shifter Retention - A console retainer mounts to a floor of a motor vehicle and receives a floor transmission shifter assembly. The shifter assembly has a forward end and a rearward end. The console retainer includes a frame portion for coupling to the floor and configured to receive at least one console trim piece. A pair of lateral side walls are integrally formed with the frame portion as a molded thermoplastic unit, wherein the lateral side walls are substantially parallel to delimit a mounting space for the shifter assembly therebetween, wherein the lateral side walls each have a forward retention feature for fixedly retaining the forward end of the shifter assembly, and wherein the lateral side walls each have a rearward retention feature for fixedly retaining the rearward end of the shifter assembly.",
            "Movable Cup Holder Divider - The disclosed embodiment provides a beverage container holder for a vehicle that utilizes a bin-like member having a floor and generally vertical walls defining a compartment with an opening at its top. A partition member extends across the opening of the bin-like member to divide the compartment into two parts, wherein the partition member is manually adjustable to a plurality of locations within the bin-like member to provide for the retention of beverage containers of various sizes."

Stoner, Northville, MI US 08-13-2009 Golf Club Head - A golf club head includes a club head body having a striking face and at least one float weight housed in a chamber defined by the club head body. The chamber has an impact wall portion, and the at least one float weight is freely movable within the chamber. The at least one float weight moves between a first position, spaced from the impact wall portion, and a second position in contact with the impact wall portion while the striking face is impacting a golf ball. 20090203464 Published Description Patent application number John L. Stoner, Sun City, AZ US 04-22-2010 System for Signal Sample Rate Conversion - An apparatus and method for converting a source signal at a first rate to a re-sampled signal at a second rate using an array of processors. A decoder decomposes the source signal into left and right source values and sends an aperture signal to a coefficient control unit upon decomposition completion. A transfer unit controllably receives and passes the left and right source values on to a re-sampler. The coefficient control unit calculates a polyphase offset based on the aperture signal and a clock signal. A coefficient server selectively passes coefficients to the re-sampler based on the polyphase offset. And the re-sampler generates the re-sampled signal based on the left and right source values and the coefficients.",
