They varied in degrees of ability, and the remaining forwards\u00a0all became pretty decent NHL players.\u00a0, 85514=Johnson was a solid pick. The Hurricanes had taken Cam Ward in 2002 and that could have been a factor in not choosing Carey Price (5th). Johnson is a good but not great and Marc Staal (12th), is the only amongst the top-20 picks who is better. Decent pick., 94597=I think this is a great example of why you shouldn't rush D-men into the NHL. Bogosian played as an 18-year-old, while Alex Pietrangelo spent two more years in junior before becoming a regular in 2010/2011. I'll always wonder how much, if any, rushing Bogosian to the NHL impacted his development. He is a solid top-four D-man, but Pietrangelo is an Olympian. It is still too early to evaluate the overall class, but Bogosian looks like a solid pick., 4801=In 1991, the New Jersey Devils selected Scott Niedermayer 3rd overall. He is one of the best #3 picks in history along with Denis Savard, Pat Lafontaine and Henrik Sedin, and Jonathan Toews should be in the conversation when his career is over., 5639=Here is a look at the top four picks since 1979., 148079=Looking at the 2006 draft and this year, there are a lot of parallels., 168032=OCTOBER 2015, 39343=All four teams missed out on the eventual best player, Jaromir Jagr went 5th to the Pittsburgh Penguins and he is 45 points shy of becoming only the 4th player in NHL history to score 1800 points. Primeau was a solid pick, but concussions cut his career short. He still finished 19th in GP and 13th in points despite his concussions., 23110=The only first rounders who played 1,000+ games were Dave Manson (11th) and Calle Johansson (14th). It wasn't a banner class, and Clark and Simpson still finished amongst the top-ten scorers from 1985, despite injuries cutting their careers short., 174588=Copyright \u00a9 The Nation Network 2012 | Glyphicons Free licensed under CC BY 3.0 | Advertise with us!, 143992=2014-15 Salary Cap comes in at $69 million, 60608=That is a solid top-four. The Kings had drafted goalie Jamie Storr, 7th overall in 1994, and likely why they passed on Luongo. Marian Hossa(12th) is the only first round skater taken after Jokinen who became better. Jokinen is 3rd in GP and 4th in points. Solid pick., 4516=Jason Gregor June 27 2014 01:09PM, 79157=In most draft years Horton would be considered a very good pick, and he still was, however, the 2003 class was incredibly deep. Tomas Vanek (5th), Ryan Suter (7th), Dion Phaneuf (9th), Jeff Carter (11th), Dustin Brown (13th), Brent Seabrook (14th), Zach Parise (17th), Ryan Getzlaf (19th), Ryan Kesler (23rd), Mike Richards (24th) and Corey Perry (28th) have all become very good. The Panthers made a solid pick.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "1979: Here is a look at the top four picks since 1979. I have included the top four picks, because some have dubbed this class \"The Fab Four\", although not all of the draft publications have Sam Reinhart, Aaron Ekblad, Sam Bennett and Leon Draisaitl rated in the top-four. But how good will their pick be? It is impossible to say, but here is a history of the #3 pick, as well as all the top-four picks over the past 35 seasons. I've said for months I didn't expect the Oilers to trade up or down, and I suspect they will use their pick tonight.\u00a0 In 1991, the New Jersey Devils selected Scott Niedermayer 3rd overall. He is one of the best #3 picks in history along with Denis Savard, Pat Lafontaine and Henrik Sedin, and Jonathan Toews should be in the conversation when his career is over.

    "textAfterTable": "Mike Foligno was a solid NHL player and he ended up having the 13th most points in his draft class and played the 14th most games. Not a bad pick, but Mike Gartner 4th, Rick Vaive 5th, Ray Bourque (8th), Brian Propp (14th) and Michel Goulet (20th) all went after him in the first round. There were some very good finds in the later rounds as well, like Mark Messier and Glenn Anderson, but I'm going to stick with first round picks in this article. 1980: Montreal Doug Wickenheiser C Regina Pats [WHL] 556 111 165 276 286 Winnipeg Dave Babych D Portland [WHL] 1195 142 581 723 970 Chicago Denis Savard F Montreal Jrs [QMJHL] 1196 473 865 1338 1336 Los Angeles Larry Murphy D Peterborough Petes [OHA] 1615 287 929 1216 1084 Denis Savard became a Hall of Famer. Only Paul Coffey (6th) and Jari Kurri (69th) had more points than Savard from his draft class. He was an outstanding pick at #3. Habs and Jets fans must still cringe when they think about this draft. 1981: Winnipeg Dale Hawerchuk C Cornwall Royals [QMJHL] 1188 518 891 1409 740 Los Angeles Doug Smith C Ottawa 67's [OHL] 535 115 138 253 624 Washington Bobby Carpenter C St. John's Prep [H.S.] 1178 320",
