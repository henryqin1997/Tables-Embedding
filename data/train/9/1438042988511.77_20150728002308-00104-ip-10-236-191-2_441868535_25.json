    "textBeforeTable": "Lawrence Marshall, St-Hubert CA 02-19-2009 Identification of sequences particularly useful for the diagnosis and identification of therapeutic targets for osteoarthritis - The invention relates to the identification and selection of sequences which demonstrate particular advantage in identifying individuals having osteoarthritis (OA). The invention also provides a selection of sequences particularly useful in diagnosing the degree of advancement of osteoarthritis of an individual and in the identification of novel therapeutic targets for OA. The invention further provides for the use of these sequences as a tool to diagnose disease progression and to monitor the efficacy of therapeutic regimens. 20090048115 Published Description Patent application number K. Wayne Marshall, Toronto CA 02-09-2012 GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND CONTROL SYSTEM FOR A VEHICLE - The present invention provides a guidance, navigation, and control method and system for an underground mining vehicle that allow said vehicle to be taught a route by a human operator and then have it automatically drive the route with no human intervention. The method works in three steps: teaching, route profiling, and playback. In the teaching step the vehicle is manually driven by a operator (or using tele-operation whereby the operator views a screen displaying live views from vehicle-mounted cameras and using remote controls) along a route which can consist of an arbitrary sequence of maneuvers including tramming forwards, switching directions, tramming backwards, turning, or pausing movement. During this phase raw data from vehicle-mounted sensors including odometric",

Marshall, Carstairs CA Patent application number Description Published 20130101880 HIGH TEMPERATURE LITHIUM BATTERY, HAVING INITIAL LOW TEMPERATURE USE CAPABILITY - A battery and method of making such battery, adapted to operate at low (typically ambient) temperatures for a short initial period and thereafter at higher temperatures. A Li\u2014Mg alloy anode is provided, comprising up to 25% magnesium, in a liquid thionyl chloride bath which as the cathode for high temperature operation. A thin, substantially pure lithium layer is applied to a surface of the Li\u2014Mg anode, preferably in the range of 0.0019 to 0.0025 inches (0.04826-0.0635 mm), to allow obtaining of sufficiently high power and voltage output at lower temperatures for a short period where at such lower temperatures the required voltage and power would not otherwise be available from a Li\u2014Mg anode. Thereafter, the battery may thereafter be used in, and exposed to, higher temperatures of up to 220\u00b0 C. where at such temperatures the necessary voltage and power from the remaining Li\u2014Mg alloy anode is then available. 04-25-2013 Richard M.
