            "The Clubs on campus are all run by students and almost all of them evolve some community service and being part of any of them is a great way to know Wesleyan and really know the students and community.",
            "It is a private school, therefore it is not cheap, yet it is worth it.",
            "I am a member of Bobcat Entertainment (BE) and we always have events that are fun for students on weekends and sometimes during the week. There is never a bored day if you know the right people and places to be.",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Yes, Wesleyan is kind of pricy, but when you graduate from here, you will have a top notch education. And they do offer many academic scholarships. Am enjoying being here I LOVE Wesleyan! The campus is beautiful. The professors are nice and really care about their students. The dorms are okay. I am really enjoying the classes. And there are many groups with which to get involved with on campus. Am learning a lot I think that Wesleyan is a very good school based on academics. The professors here really want their students to learn and are willing to help in any way they can. They know each of their students by name and are concerned about you and how you are doing. I am learning a lot, and enjoying it too. Login to rate or flag the reviews David from Buckhannon, WV 10/30/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 3 of 28",
