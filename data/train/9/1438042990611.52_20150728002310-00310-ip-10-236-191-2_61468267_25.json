The modal length (the most common) is 12 characters long, and the average length is 13.539 characters long. The median length is also 12 characters (there are as many domains of length shorter than than 12 characters as there are domains of length longer than 12 characters). Above is the distribution of lengths of all the registered .com domains. Having access to a database of domain names, I decided to run some more analysis on the .com and .net databases. Distribution of lengths Because '.com' is now part of our common vernacular, internet users are intimately familiar with it. When coming up with a new business name, sure, it's probably possible to find a suitable name in .net space, but these days, why bother? Unless it's unique you'd not be able to find the same name free in the .com space, which is where everyone would probably look in first. Better to simply research/brainstorm further and find a name you can acquire/repurchase in the .com arena and bypass all the confusion/customer education. From the diagram, we can see the ascendancy of the .com name space. Of the 102.8 million names in .com space, only 12.54% of these same names are also registered in .net namespace. The vast majority of owners of .com",
