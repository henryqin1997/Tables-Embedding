Payne took 42 wickets at 30.90 that season and averaged 22.90 from 22 wickets in 2012. But 2013 was difficult for him and he returned only 18 wickets at 50.94. That winter he attended the Darren Lehmann academy in Adelaide but his trip was cut short by an ankle injury. A bruised heel also hampered his 2014 season but he came back in the second half to take 17 wickets at just 16.41 to help Gloucestershire to the quarter-final of the Royal London Cup. ESPNcricinfo staff, 58155=Aug 7, 2010, 56568=Jul 7, 2014, 52101=Payne had already been part of Gloucestershire's academy for a year before he was first picked for England Under-19s' trip to South Africa in January 2009 and at the end of the year found his way onto the ECB Elite Player Development Programme. He played five of England's six matches at the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand and took 10 wickets at 14.20., 57459=Jun 14, 2013, 51657=A brisk left-arm seamer, David Payne hasn't yet developed into a consistent performer that his talent as a teenager suggested he might become but, partly out of necessity, is now taking on a more senior role in the Gloucestershire attack and is especially effective in one-day cricket. He signed a new three-year contract in October 2014., 35262=Born February 15, 1991, Poole, Dorset}",
