Specifically, groups of seven embryonated hen eggs were inoculated via the chorioallantoic membrane on the tenth day of gestation with the bacteria and phage indicated. P1-pDoc phage was produced from a P1 lysogen which harbors pDoc, a transfer plasmid encodes the doc gene or control transfer plasmid pBHR. This phage preparation was a mixture of virions containing either P1 DNA or pDoc. Phage lysates were approximately a ratio of 99:1 P1 containing phage particles to pDoc containing particles. These results indicate that a pathogenic infection may be eradicated by a therapeutic of the invention, such as doc via a P1 delivery vehicle.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{168885=With regard to the selection of the appropriate sites on target RNA, it is known that target site secondary structure can have an effect on cleavage in vitro (Whitton, 1994 supra). A number of procedures are available to select accessible sites in RNA targets. In a preferred procedure, a library screen may be employed to select appropriate sites on the target RNA. Accessibility of the selected site may then be confirmed using techniques known to those skilled in the art. Thus, the selected target molecule's sequence can be routinely screened for potential secondary structure, using the program RNAFOLD (from the PCGENE group of programs or available on the Internet). Thus, reasonable predictions of target accessibility can be made. Computer assisted RNA folding (Castanotto et al., 1994), along with computational analysis for 3-dimensional modeling of RNA (Major et al., Science 253:1255-1260, 1991 and Castanotto et al., 1994) is certainly effective in guiding the choice of cleavage sites., 290784=The first model of use is that of Stieritz, D. D. and Holder, I. A. (1975, J. Infect. Dis. 131(6): 688-691); also see Neely, A. N. and Holder, I. A., 1996, \u201cA murine model with aspects of clinical relevance for the study of antibiotic-induced endotoxin release in septic hosts. J. Endotoxin Research 3: 229-235.). Young adult female mice, 22-25 g, ICR strain (or possibly Balb/c, CD1, C3HEB/FeJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6, DBA/2, A/J, CBA, C3H/HeN) are anesthetized with pentobarbitol and shaved of dorsal hair. A heat resistant plastic card with a 1\ufffd1.5 inch opening is placed on the shaved back, 0.5 ml ethanol pipetted onto the exposed skin and ignited for a 10 second burn. The flame is extinguished, and the mouse given 1-2 ml saline via intraperitoneal (IP) injection as fluid replacement. This procedure produces a non-lethal, partial thickness burn covering 12-15% of the body surface area of a 22-25 g mouse (Neely and Holder, 1996, supra). One hour after the burn, and after mice have received analgesia (buprenorphine 2 mg/kg, IM), a small inocula of bacteria (100 cfu P. aeruginosa) in 0.1 ml saline is injected subcutaneously into the wound. Toxic agent treatment agent or placebo is administered either simultaneously to the same site (also 0.1 ml in saline) or by IP injection (up to 0.5 ml in saline) 1 hour after or shortly before challenge. Animals are observed for sepsis and medicated for pain (buprenorphine 2 mg/kg, IM) at intervals not exceeding 12 h. Normal diet and water is provided ad libitum. Mortality is expected in untreated burned groups within approximately 48 h. Blood samples (10-25 ul) may be taken at 12-24 h intervals by tail bleed to monitor bacterial load. Blood and organs are collected at time of death or euthanasia, to monitor bacterial load and confirm death from P. aeruginosa sepsis or clearance of infection in treated animals., 139363=Tissue-specific promoters can be used in the present nucleic acid constructs. Examples of these promoters include the sequences for probasin-promoter, a promoter-specific for prostate epithelium prostate-specific antigen (prostate), keratin, k7 (epidermal sabaceus glands), albumin (liver), fatty acid binding protein (ileum), whey acidic protein (breast), lactalbumin, smooth muscle actin (smooth muscle), etc. In a specific embodiment, a mouse albumin promoter/enhancer is used which consists of nucleotides 338-668 from Genbank accession # U04199, followed by the sequence gagtcgacggatccgg (SEQ ID NO:13), followed by nucleotides 1762-1846 from accession # J04738, followed by the nucleotide sequence tgggggtgggggtgggg (SEQ ID NO:14) followed by nucleotides 1864-2063 of accession # J04738. In one embodiment, the mouse promoter/enhancer is active in hepatocyte (e.g., human hepatocytes, hepatocyte cultures, etc.) and is useful for tissue-specific expression in liver tissue. It will also be clear that target-specific promoters not yet identified can be used to target expression of the present ribozymes to the selected tissue(s). Once a target-specific promoter is identified its binding sequence can be determined by routine methods such as sequence analysis may be used. The promoter is defined by deletion analysis, mutagenesis, footprinting, gel shifts and transfection analyses (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). Pathogen-specific promoters can be used in the present nucleic acid constructs., 295110=This is the model of endogenous septicemia of Furuya et al. (Furuya, N., Hirakata, Y., Tomono, K., Matsumoto, T., Tateda, K., Kaku, M., and Yamaguchi, K., 1993, \u201cMortality rates amongst mice with endogenous septicemia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from various sources.\u201d J. Medical Microbiology 39: 141-146). Mice weighing 20-25 g are housed in a sterile environment (e.g., in an isolator) and given sterile diet and water. IP injections of sodium ampicillin (200 mg/kg) are given on days 1 and 2 to disturb normal intestinal flora and aid colonization by P. aeruginosa. Cyclophosphamide is injected IP (250 mg/kg) on days 6 and 9. This dose induces leukopenia without lethality in the absence of infection. The bacteria are administered to the mice in their drinking water on days 2-4. Treatment with therapeutic of the invention (P1 phage comprising a Transfer plasmid encoding a toxic agent) is started on day 9, and is administered by IP injection. Fecal pellets are be collected before bacterial challenge and at intervals throughout the infection to monitor for the absence and presence of P. aeruginosa. The onset of sepsis is expected 24-48 h after the second dose of cyclophosphamide (day 11), and approximately 80% mortality is expected by day 14. Signs of distress in the animals are treated with buprenorphine (2 mg/kg, twice daily or as needed). Blood samples obtained by tail bleed may also be taken at 12-24 h intervals after day 4. Alternatively, the ampicillin injections can be avoided by introducing the bacteria by IP injection the day after the final cyclophosphamide injection (Woods, D. E., Lam, J. S., Paranchych, D. P., Speert, D. P., Campbell, M., and Godfrey, A. J., 1997, \u201cCorrelation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence factros from clinical and environmental isolates with pathogenicity in the neutropenic mouse. Can. J. Microbiol. 43:541-551)., 135844=Promoters specific for the target (e.g., a specific pathogen, genus, etc.) in question can be selected by screening genomic sequences for the ability to activate a promoterless reporter gene. The promoterless reporter gene is based on the strategy developed for use with plasmid pMC1871 (Casadaban et al., 1983, Meth. Enzymol. 100:293). For non-viral pathogens, plasmid capable of stable replication and maintenance in the microorganism understudy is modified by standard molecular biology techniques to carry the coding region of a reporter gene (Sambrook et al. latest edition). The reporter gene can be any of a number of standard reporter genes including but not limited to the lacZ gene of E. coli, which codes for \u03b2-galactosidase. Total genomic DNA is isolated from cells of the pathogen, cleaved with restriction endonucleases to yield fragments of a few hundred basepairs on average. These fragments are then ligated into a unique restriction endonuclease cleavage site at the 5\u2032 end of the reporter gene coding region, creating a library of plasmids. The library is then transformed into the pathogen by standard techniques and the resulting transformants are screened for expression of the reporter gene. In the case of lacZ, the transformants can be plated onto medium containing the chromogenic galactosidase substrate X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-D-galactoside). Transformants that contain a plasmid with an insert carrying a promoter will express \u03b2-galactosidase and will turn blue on X-Gal plates. The intensity of the blue color is relative to the level of expression; promoters of different strength can be selected based on the intensity of the blue color., 278170=In vivo plasmid transfer in chicken embryos: The Transfer plasmid pBHR was delivered to bacterial cells by P1 phage in vivo in using embryonated hen eggs, Specifically, groups of six embryonated hen eggs were inoculated via the chorioallantoic membrane on the tenth day of gestation with the bacteria and phage indicated. P1 lysogen which harbors pDoc, a transfer plasmid which encodes the doc gene. This phage preparation was a mixture of particles containing either p1 DNA or pDoc. Phage lysates were approximately a ratio of 99:1 P1 containing phage particles to pDoc containing particles., 122499=Vaccinia viral vectors may be used in accordance with the present invention, as large fragments of DNA are easily cloned into its genome and recombinant attenuated vaccinia variants have been described (Meyer, et al., 1991, J. Gen. Virol. 72:1031-1038). Orthomyxoviruses, including influenza; Paramyxoviruses, including respiratory syncytial virus and Sendai virus; and Rhabdoviruses may be engineered to express mutations which result in attenuated phenotypes (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,473, issued Nov. 26, 1996). These viral genomes may also be engineered to express foreign nucleotide sequences, such as the selected toxic agent and/or ribozymes of the present invention (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,057, issued Nov. 24, 1992, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Reverse genetic techniques can be applied to manipulate negative and positive strand RNA viral genomes to introduce mutations which result in attenuated phenotypes, as demonstrated in influenza virus, Herpes Simplex virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, Sindbis virus and poliovirus (see Palese et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:11354-11358). These techniques may also be utilized to introduce foreign DNA, i.e., the selected toxic agent and/or ribozyme, to create recombinant viral vectors to be used in accordance with the present invention. In addition, attenuated adenoviruses and retroviruses may be engineered to express the toxic agent and/or ribozymes. Therefore, a wide variety of viruses may be engineered to design the ribozymes delivery vehicles of the present invention., 124117=The viral vectors, of the present invention may be engineered to express the toxic agents and/or ribozymes in a tissue specific manner. For example, the promoter of the carcinoembryonic antigen (LEA) is expressed in a proportion of breast, lung and colorectal cancers, but rarely in healthy tissues. In order to target a hepatoma, the \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) promoter whose activity is restricted to malignant cells. Proliferating cells can be targeted with a flt-1 promoter, which has been shown to allow preferential targeting of proliferating endothelial cells. See Miller et al., 1997, Human Gene Therapy 8:803-815, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 316053=The experimental procedure is as follows (see e.g., Pier, G. B. et al., 1996, \u201cRole of mutant CFTR in hypersusceptibility of cystic fibrosis patients to lung infections\u201d Science 271: 64-67). Adult mice are anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a freshly prepared mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (65 mg/kg) and xylazine (13 mg/kg). Then with mice are held in an upright position, and 10 ul of a bacterial suspension is placed in each nostril (20 ul total). Mice are allowed to regain consciousness and then either observed for survival for up to 72 hours, or, sacrificed by CO2 overdose at various time periods up to 24 hours after infection for determination of bacterial loads in various tissues, especially the lungs. Anesthesia is a necessary part of the infection procedure. Unanesthetized mice fail to aspirate the inoculum efficiently and do not become infected. Therapeutic phage comprising one or more toxic agents of the invention are administered, for example, intranasally, intravenously, or intraperitoneally. Mice administered the Therapeutic of the invention survive longer than the untreated control mice. Accordingly, the toxic agents of the invention may be delivered to a subject harboring a pathogenic (e.g., bacterial) infection for the purpose of ameliorating or eradicating the infection., 129750=In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the plasmid DNA carrying the nucleic acids encoding the toxic agents and/or ribozymes of the invention may be delivered via polycations, molecules which carry multiple positive charges and are used to achieve gene transfer in vivo and ex vivo. Polycations, such as polyethilenimine, may be used to achieve successful gene transfer in vivo and ex vivo (e.g., see Boletta et al., 1996, J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 7: 1728, incorporated herein by reference in this entirety.), 29879=Infectious diseases sicken or kill millions of people each year. Each year in the United States alone, hundreds of thousands of people are infected with resistant bacterial strains that are no longer treatable with drugs like penicillin and vancomycin (Hiramatsu et al, 1997, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 46:624-26). Infections associated with antimicrobial resistance include those acquired in hospitals (nosocomial), such as pneumonia particularly in the young, elderly and immunocompromised), typhoid fever, bacterial meningitis, and tuberculosis. Around the world, nearly 1.5 billion people carry various types of the tuberculosis bacteria and depending on the country, up to 40 percent have proven to be resistant to antibiotics (see, Boyce et al, 1997, Epidemilogy and prevention of nosocomil infections. In The Staphylococcus in Human Disease. Crossley and Archer Eds, Chruchill Livingston Inc., New York, N.Y.). It is estimated that in some developed countries, up to 60% of all nosocomial infections result from bacteria resistant to antibiotics. For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is of the most common gram-negative bacterium associated with nosocomial infections and outbreaks in burn units. Infections by this organism are associated with high mortality (60%), which is attributed to the high intrinsic resistance of members of this genus to many structurally unrelated antibiotics. Gram-positive bacteria also have a significant impact on infectious diseases. For example, Staphylococcus aureus, is a Gram-positive organism which is responsible for about 260,000 hospital acquired infections in the United States which subsequently causes between 60,000 and 80,000 deaths annually (see, Boyce et al, supra)., 292802=The second model is that of Waymack et al. (J. P. Waymack, G. D. Warden, J. W. Alexander, P. M. and S. Gonce., 1988, \u201cAn evaluation of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator in multiple septic animal models\u201d. J. Burns and Clinical Rehabilitation 9(3):271-274.). Young male Lewis rats (100-125 g) are anesthetized by IP pentobarbitol injection (\u02dc40 mg/kg) and shaved of dorsal hair. The animal is pressed against a heat resistant template that exposes the shaved area (20% of the total body surface area). This template is immersed in a 95\ufffd C. waterbath for 10 seconds. After removal from the waterbath, the animals receive 5-10 ml Ringer's Lactate solution by IP injection for fluid maintenance therapy (approximately one half blood volume is recommended) and buprenorphine for analgesia (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, every 12 h). This injury is reported to be a full-thickness burn resulting in zero mortality in the absence of further injury. A 50% lethal dose bacterial challenge (1\ufffd108 cfu P. aeruginosa in 0.5 ml saline) is introduced by IP injection on day 4 post-burn or by painting the bacterial suspension on the wound on day 1 post-burn. The IP infection route is reported to produce sepsis within 24 h (i.e. day 5 post-burn) with all deaths occurring by day 12 post-burn. Therefore, an IP injection demonstration may be terminated on day 12 post-burn. Painting of Pseudomonas on the burn is reported to result in sepsis 7-8 days after inoculation (day 8-9 post-burn), and survival rates are stable by day 20. Euthanasia of animals subjected to this regimen will be on day 21 post-burn. Normal diet and water will be provided ad libitum. Some animals are treatment with the therapeutic of the invention (P1 phage comprising a Transfer plasmid encoding a toxic agent) which is administered topically to the burn region or by IP injection. Blood samples (50 100 ul) may be taken by retro-orbital bleed of pentobarbitol anesthetized rats at intervals of 12-24 h to monitor bacterial load. Blood and organs are collected at time of death or euthanasia, also to monitor bacterial load and confirm death from P. aeruginosa sepsis., 150217=A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler, et al., 1977, Cell 11:223), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, 1962, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:2026), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy, et al., 1980, Cell 22:817) genes can be employed in tk\u2212, hgprt\u2212 or aprt\u2212 cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler, et al., 1980, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:3567; O'Hare, et al., 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1527); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2072); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Colberre-Garapin, et al., 1981, J. Mol. Biol. 150:1); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre, et al., 1984, Gene 30:147)., 96031=The present invention encompasses expression systems, both eucaryotic and procaryotic expression vectors, which may be used to express the toxic agents and/or multi-ribozymes of the invention. The DNA expression vectors and viral vectors containing the nucleic acids encoding the toxic agents of the present invention may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing the expression vectors and viral vectors of the invention by expressing nucleic acid encoding a toxic agent and/or multi-ribozyme sequences are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing gene product coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1989, supra, and Ausubel et al., 1989, supra. Alternatively, nucleic acids capable of encoding a toxic agent and/or ribozyme sequence may be chemically synthesized using, for example, synthesizers. See, for example, the techniques described in \u201cOligonucleotide Synthesis\u201d, 1984, Gait, M. J. ed., IRL Press, Oxford, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 166385=Third, a toxic agent may be selected to target an essential antisense molecule. Thus, a toxic agent may be a sense molecule which is designed to be complementary to an essential antisense RNA. An example of an essential antisense molecule is Sof. Sof is an antisense antidote for the chromosomally encoded toxin called gef (Poulsen, L., et al., 1991, Mol. Microbiology 5:1639-48). Sof normally acts to regulate the levels of gef in the bacterium. The inventors of the present invention have designed sense molecules which are complementary to Sof. The sense molecules against Sof act to inhibit the ability of Sof to regulate gef, and thus cause toxicity in the pathogen by allowing the endogenous gef levels to become toxic., 275277=In order to demonstrate efficacy of the toxic agent delivered by the P1 delivery vehicle, an embryonated hen egg model of infection has been modified from published protocols. Superficially, the hen egg model of Hartl, A., et al., (1997, \u201cPseudomonas aeruginosa infection in embryonated hen's eggs\u201d Arzneim.-Forsch. 47(II): 1061-1064), was modified in the manner in which the eggs were incubated and the shells opened and administration was performed. Briefly, eggs were incubated in the vertical position, wide pole up, with automatic turning in a 90 degree arc every 4 h. Shells were opened on the wide pole end, by reinforcing the shell with adhesive tape and cutting a round hole with a scissors through the tape and shell (opening diameter approx. 1 cm). The underlying shell membrane was moistened with sterile water, then partially removed by tearing off a 1 cm2 portion with a sterile forceps, which exposes the transparent chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). The shell was sealed against moisture loss with more adhesive tape and incubation continued for 18-24 h. Viability was assessed at that time by candling (observing the embryo by holding the egg in front of a bright light source). Observation of spontaneous movement was evidence of viability. Viable eggs were inoculated by pipeting bacterial suspensions onto the CAM. Therapeutic agents were pipeted onto the CAM or injected through the shell at other locations by syringe. Openings in the shell were resealed with tape, incubation continued, and viability was scored at intervals by candling as above. Bacteria and phage were introduced into the egg through an opening made in the shell, which was then sealed and gestation continued., 108936=The invention provides the use of any virion for the delivery of a toxic agent or ribozyme to a target cell. For example, a common bacteriophage of E. coli, P1, is an attractive delivery vehicle for the invention for a number of reasons. First and foremost, P1 has a broad intergenera and interspecies range (Yarmolinsky et al., 1988, Mol. Gen. Genet. 113:273-284). The P1 receptor of E. coli is the terminal glucose of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core lysergic ring of the bacterial outer membrane (Generalized Transduction, p. 2421-2441. In F. Neidhardt (ed.), Escherichia coli and Salmonella:Cellular and Molecular Biology, 2d ed. Vol. 2, ASM Press, Washington, D.C.). Yarmolinsky and Sternberg report that in addition to E. coli, this particular phage has the ability to inject its nucleic acid into a large number (>25) of diverse Gram negative bacteria (Yarmolinsky et al., 1988, Mol. Gen. Genet. 113:273-284). Secondly, P1 can accommodate a significant amount of genetic information, over 2% (100,000 bp) of the DNA of E. coli (Generalized Transduction, p. 2421-2441. In F. Neidhardt (ed.), Escherichia coli and Salmonella:Cellular and Molecular Biology, 2d ed. Vol. 2, ASM Press, Washington, D.C.). Consequently, gene dosage of the ribozymes or toxic agents can be increased through multiplication of the toxic agents and/or ribozymes, thereby increasing the microbicidal activity of the toxic agents and/or ribozymes. Accordingly, bacteriophage P1 is used as the delivery vehicle or molecular syringe. P1 has advantages over certain with lytic phage therapy which may harbor risk of 1) dissemination of undesirable products (e.g., DNA originating from the P1 bacteriophage) to nonpathogenic indigenous microflora, 2) excessively narrow host range, 3) rapid clearance of the material by the reticuloendothelial system of the host and 4) the concern that a lytic infection could become uncontrolled in commensal bacteria in immunocompromised patients. In certain of these embodiments, the P1 delivery system is the preferable delivery vehicle for delivery of a toxic agent to a target pathogenic bacterium. An additional advantage of the P1 delivery vehicle is that phage-mediated transfer of undesirable products may be decreased or avoided when the phage are engineered such that they are incapable of transferring endogenous phage DNA to the host. In this embodiment, the phage particles inject transfer plasmid DNA into target bacterial cells. Expression of the encoded toxic agents may then result in bacterial cell death independent of the bacterium's resistance to antibiotics., 127286=Cationic and neutral liposomes are contemplated by this invention. Cationic liposomes can be complexed with a negatively-charged biologically active molecule (e.g., DNA) by mixing these components and allowing them to charge-associate. Cationic liposomes are particularly useful when the biologically active molecule is a nucleic acid because of the nucleic acids negative charge. Examples of cationic liposomes include lipofectin, lipofectamine, lipofectace and DOTAP (Hawley-Nelson et al., 1992, Focus 15(3):73-83; Felgner et al., 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84:7413; Stewart et al., 1992, Human Gene Therapy 3:267-275). Procedures for forming cationic liposomes encasing substances are standard in the art (Nicolau et al., 1987, Methods Enzymol. 149:157) and can readily be utilized herein by one of ordinary skill in the art to encase the complex of this invention., 129039=In one embodiment of the present invention, systemic delivery and in vivo and ex vivo gene expression is optimized using commercially available cationic lipids, e.g., dimethyldioctadeclammonium bromide (DDAB); a biodegradable lipid 1,2-bis(oleoyloxy)-3-(trimethylammonio) propane (DOTAP); these liposomes may be mixed with a neutral lipid, e.g., L-\u03b1 dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) or cholesterol (Chol), two commonly used neutral lipids for systemic delivery. DNA:liposome ratios may be optimized using the methods used by those of skill in the art (e.g., see Templeton et al., 1997, Nature Biotechnology 15: 647-152, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety)., 83125=The ribozymes of the present invention possesses sufficient catalytic activity to inactivate the RNA of the targeted RNAs. From an antimicrobial perspective, hammerhead-type ribozymes are especially attractive since the molecule inactivates gene expression catalytically through the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of the mRNA. Furthermore, hammerhead-type ribozymes have been re-engineered to function in an intermolecular or transducer (trans) acting state (Haseloff et al., 1988, Nature 334(6183):585-91; Uhlenbeck. O. C., 1987, Nature 328(6131):59). The catalytic activity of the ribozyme requires a sufficient concentration of the divalent cation, Mg+2, and substrate. The substrate can have any sequence as long as the cleavages site contains the recognition element NUX, where N represents any nucleotide, U corresponds to uracil, and X is any nucleotide except G (Koizumi et al., 1989, Nucleic Acids Resonant. 17(17):7059-71). Ribozymes have been widely demonstrated to function in vivo (Christoffersen et al., 1995, J. Med. Chem. 38(12):2023-37; Inokuchi et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269(15):11361-6). The present invention improves the initial design of hammerhead-type ribozymes (Taira et al., 1991, NAR 19(9):5125-5130) by constructing multi-ribozymes consisting of ribozyme cassettes. Ribozyme cassettes contain one or more cis-acting hammerhead ribozymes flanking a ribozyme that inactivates the targeted RNA(s) as well as one or more flanking sequences. Upon transcription the targeted ribozyme is released as a 60-70 base transcript which not only improves its specificity by reducing non-specific interactions but also improves its catalytic activity as well. This invention includes modifications to and use of the ribozyme described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,519 and PCT publications No. WO98/24925, WO97/17433, WO98/24925, WO99/67400, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety., 223206=TSST-I promoter (SEQ ID NO:6) (GenBank accession number U93688, see also Lindsay, J. A., et al., 1998, \u201cThe gene for toxic shock toxin is carried by a family of mobile pathogenicity islands in Staphylococcus aureus\u201d Mol. Microbiol. 29 (2), 527-543):, 27355=This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/548,449, filed Apr. 13, 2000, now abandoned which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/291,902, filed Apr. 14, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,271,359. The disclosures of these prior applications are considered part of (and are incorporated by reference in) the disclosure of this application., 75950=In a specific embodiment, the antisense sequence is based on DicF (Bouche F, et al., 1989, Mol Microbiol. 3:991-4). Such modified DicF sequence is referred to as DicF1 (SEQ ID NO:9). Naturally occurring DicF is part of an intercistronic region that when expressed in Escherichia coli causes inhibition of cell division. This inhibition does not require the translation of DicF mRNA into protein, instead, DicF RNA exerts its inhibitory effect as an antisense molecule., 314673=The toxic agents of the invention are useful for the treatment of pathogenic infection such as infections associated with cystic fibrosis. As demonstration of the utility of the invention, a mouse model of pseudomonas respiratory infection is used which mimics the type of infection seen in human Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. This model uses adult (6-8 week old) mice which carry the DF508 mutation in the cftr gene (C57BL/6 DF508 mice) and their wild type counterparts (C57BL/6 mice), or BALB/c adult mice without cftr mutations. The DF508 mutation is one of the most common mutations found in human CF patients, and the C57BL/6 DF508 mice have many symptoms similar to humans with this disease. After weaning, DF508 cftr homozygous mutants must be maintained on a liquid diet of Peptamin (Clintec Nutrition Co., Deerfield, Mich.) and water containing golytely (Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, Mass.) in order to prevent fatal bowel obstructions which are common in these mice due to their cftr mutation (see Zaidi, T. S., et al, 1999 \u201cCystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated corneal epithelial cell ingestion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key component in the pathogenesis of experimental murine keratitis\u201d Infection and Immunity 67(3): 1481-1492). BALB/c mice can also be used if C57BL/6 DF508 mice are not available., 289007=In two models, immune impairment is produced in a burn model. Specifically, a burn of 10-20% total body surface area in humans or other animals results in a period of immune impairment, involving nearly all branches of the immune system, which lasts from 10-14 days. Two burn models, well documented in the literature (see, e.g., J. P. Waymack, et al, 1988, \u201cAn evaluation of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator in multiple septic animal models\u201d J. Burns and Clinical Rehabilitation 9(3):271-274; see also Stieritz, D. D. and Holder, I. A., 1975, \u201cExperimental studies of the pathogenesis of infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Description of a burned mouse model\u201d J. Infect. Dis. 131(6): 688-691) for experimental infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of a toxic agent therapeutic against the types of infections which occur with this type of wound., 289957=The third model utilizes the biological modulator cyclophosphamide to produce an immunocompromised state (leukopenia), in which endogenous microflora of the intestinal tract can invade the body cavity and cause sepsis. This type of sepsis has been documented in human patients with immunodeficiency (see, Furuya, et al, 1993, \u201cMortality rates amongst mice with endogenous septicemia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from various sources.\u201d J. Medical Microbiology 39: 141-146; Woods, et al, 1997, \u201cCorrelation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence factros from clinical and environmental isolates with pathogenicity in the neutropenic mouse\u201d Can. J. Microbiol. 43: 541-551)., 66459=One example of an addiction system toxin that may be used in connection with the invention is doc (death on curing; Lehnherr H, et al., 1993, J. Mol. Biol. 233:414-28). The protein encoded by doc is lethal or toxic in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms (e.g., E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis). doc acts as a bacterial cell toxin to which Phd (prevention of host death) is the antidote. Accordingly, the invention provides for plasmids expressing doc which can be delivered to a bacterial pathogen in order to render the pathogen less fit, and preferably eradicate the pathogen. A particular advantage of doc is that doc has little to no toxicity to eukaryotic cells, and thus may be administered safely to a eukaryotic host., 277028=An embryonated hen egg model was established, as above, which harbors a variety of advantages as an in vivo system. Specifically, the egg model required very low LD50 (<10 cfu/egg for P. aeruginosa and >50 cfu/egg for virulent strains of E. coli), the egg model is also rapid, self contained and provides for an immature immune system. Human clinical isolates of E. coli and P. aeruginosa (PA01) consistently produce lethal infections in this model at very low doses of bacteria (100-1000 cells) allowing demonstration of the therapeutic agents. These tests show efficacy for the toxic agent such as doc in vivo., 111620=Additionally, a process utilizing in vitro packaging is also possible. In vitro packaging can be accomplished through the addition of PAC-sites to the genetic information of the toxic agent or ribozyme construct. P1 packaging initiates within one of the P1 PAC genes (Steinberg, N., 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 194(3) :469-79). It has been reported that the active PAC site is contained within a 161 base-pair segment of the P1 EcoR1 fragment 20 (Steinberg, N., 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 194(3) :469-79). Thus, the phage head serves as a molecular syringe that delivers the inactivating ribozyme(s) and/or toxic agent(s) to the pathogen., 345678=Abiologic delivery of the toxic agent and/or ribozymes is accomplished with constructs that have been engineered to be expressed within the targeted tissue or pathogen. Briefly, the genetic element containing the promoter and the toxic agent and/or ribozyme(s) are complexed with cationic liposomes (Lipofectamine\u2014Gibco BRL) in a 1:10 ratio and are introduced into test animals by either single or multiple injection of 0.2 ml total volume nucleic acid-liposome mixture., 172836=A second example of a ribozyme target can be the mRNA of the secA gene from bacteria. The product of this gene is the essential and rate-limiting component of the general secretory pathway in bacteria (Bassford et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Research Apr. 11, 22(7):1326; Nucleic Acid Research. 22(3):293-300). SecA has been found in every prokaryotic cell investigated to date. Additionally, its biosynthesis is translationally coupled to the upstream gene, X (Schmidt et al., 1991, J. Bacteriol. 173(20):6605-11), presenting a convenient target for a ribozyme. Inhibition or decreased synthesis of secA is also sufficient to confer a reduction in viability to the cell (Schmidt et al., 1987, J. Bacteriol. 171(2):643-9). Furthermore, as a pathogen responds to changes required of the infectious process a change in the availability of a key protein such as secA will disadvantage the pathogen enabling the host to counteract it. Finally, control over the secretion-responsive expression of secA is at the level of translation (Christoffersen et al., 1995, J. Med. Chem. 38(12):2023-37), and the regulatory sequences within its polycistronic message have been localized to a region comprised of the end of the upstream gene, X, and the beginning of secA. Consequently, inactivation of the transcript by the catalytic cleavage of a ribozyme has profound consequences for the viability of the invading microorganism., 31665=Although, numerous antimicrobial therapies have been designed to target one or several infectious agents, many therapies show varying degrees of success in eradicating infection. Only a very limited number of new antibiotics have come onto the market in the last decade, yet the number of deadly bacteria that are resistant to these drug therapies has soared. For example, vancomycin is one of the last effective antimicrobial available for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection (MRSA). However, vancomycin resistant isolates S. aureus have now emerged (Hiramatsu et al, 1997, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 46:624-26). Additionally, the failure of many of these therapies to target specific infectious agents has lead to overuse or inappropriate use of the therapies, which in turn has lead to the development of drug resistant microbes. The development of drug resistance in many infectious agents has reduced the efficacy and increased the risk of using the traditional antimicrobial therapies., 174281=The third ribozyme can target essential factor for DNA biosynthesis, such as DnaG. Every 1 to 2 seconds, at least 1,000 times for each replication fork within E. coli, priming of an Okazaki fragment is repeated as a result of an interaction between the cellular primase dnaG (Bouche et al., 1975, J. Biol. Chem. 250:5995-6001) and dnaB (Marians, K. J. 1996, Replication Fork Propagation, p. 749-763. In F. C. Neidhardt (ed.), Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology, 2nd ed, vol. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.). As would be expected of a protein required every 1 to 2 seconds during replication, a lesion within DnaG or an alteration in its concentration results in an immediate stop phenotype (Marians, K. J. 1996, Replication Fork Propagation, p. 749-763. In F. C. Neidhardt (ed.), Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology, 2nd ed, vol. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.); Weschler et al., 1971, Mol. Gen. Genet. 113:273-284). Therefore, inactivation of the DnaG message by a ribozyme should have profound cellular consequences in that general priming of the lagging strand is reduced if not eliminated. DnaG is a component of the primosome, a multi-protein complex responsible for priming replication. Any of the components of the primosome, either individually or in any combination, can serve as a target for inactivation of the primosome and, thus, kill the cell. The other components of the primosome are DnaB, DnaC, DnaT, PriA, PriB, and PriC. Thus, the primosome is also sufficiently complex to provide numerous other targets (DnaB, DnaC, DnaT, PriA, PriB and PriC) for inactivation by the trans-acting ribozyme., 128196=In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the plasmid DNA carrying the gene(s) that codes for the toxic agents and/or ribozymes of the invention are complexed with liposomes using an improved method to achieve increased systemic delivery and gene expression (Templeton et al., 1997, Nature Biotechnology 15: 647-652, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In accordance with the present invention, an improved formulation of cationic lipids which greatly increase the efficiency of DNA delivery to host cells, with extended half-life in vivo and procedures to target specific tissues in vivo. For example, but not by limitation, peptides and proteins may be engineered to the outer lipid bilayer, such as liver-specific proteins, leads to substantially enhanced delivery to the liver etc.}",
