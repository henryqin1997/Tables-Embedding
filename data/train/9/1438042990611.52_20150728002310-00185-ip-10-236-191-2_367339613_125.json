This range of IP addresses is called a netmask. By default, show commands display an IP address and then its netmask in dotted decimal notation.

    "textAfterTable": "Command History Release Modification 10.0 This command was introduced. 12.2(33)SRA This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRA. 12.2SX This command is supported in the Cisco IOS Release 12.2SX train. Support in a specific 12.2SX release of this train depends on your feature set, platform, and platform hardware. Usage Guidelines The show ip masks command is useful for debugging when a variable-length subnet mask (VLSM) is used. It shows the number of masks associated with the network and the number of routes for each mask. Examples The following is sample output from the show ip masks command:  Router# show ip masks 172.16.0.0 Mask Reference count 255.255.255.255 2 255.255.255.0 3 255.255.0.0 1 show ip nat limits all-host",
