    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{760873=Parking: if you commute to the campus, get there EARLY if you want a parking spot thats still on campus. outdoors parking lots are full by 9:30 ish. same for garages, however, there is one other garage across from the Info-tech building thats always open, for those days you just need to sleep in. weather: unknown to most freshman, almost every building is connected via either over street walkways, or underground tunnels. if you park in the sports building garage (get there by 9:30) you can exit its second level and take the tunnel to the main building of the campus, and from there you can get anywhere on campus without setting foot outside. Prep: before your first semester even starts, try getting into the bridge program. it starts in the summer and is college prep course, that counts as a credit. it REALLY helps prepare you for the coming semester. you will learn where all the buildings are, brush up on your math and writing, how to write at college level, and as each bridge is unique to your chosen major, you will get a chance to visit the teachers and buildings associated with it., 412616=IUPUI has only one dormitory as of 2012, however, they are planing to add a new one for 2013. The current dorm is available only to Freshman, is very old, and lacks air conditioning in all rooms except those on the first floor. However, IUPUI has other housing options such fully furnish apartments that are luxurious for college life, and are well worth the exter money., 673515=Greek Life is getting a large overhaul in 2013 which includes more support for current sororities and fraternities and those that are just being established. If you are interested in joining a sorority or a frat, it is highly recommended., 865230=IUPUI has Park place, Riverwalk apartments, University towers, Ball Hall, and are currently building a new housing unit because more and more students are attending IUPUI each year! Housing prices range from $2000 to $4000 and this is housing just 5 minutes away from downtown. That price includes a fully furnished apartment and also utilities which includes internet, cable, electric, and more., 102652=this university is in the heart of downtown indianapolis. currently, it hosted several events for the 2012 superbowl. there are several dining, museum, shopping and entertainment options., 461388=The food is beyond delicious. It's also right in the Campus Center which is the heart of the campus. It was built in 2008 and is beautiful in design., 720734=Living in the Riverwalk apartments are very nice and safe, but they prove to be a bullet to the pocketbook. I'm paying over $900 a month to live where I do, and although the apartments are nice and spacious, I find it to be too expensive. There are other options however such as The Avenue, Ball Hall, and 1201. My personal suggestion would be to live in the Avenue because it is a cheaper option, and it is a little farther off campus where you have privacy from the campus's eyes, but still are close enough to walk. Ball Hall is strictly for freshmen, and doesn't have air conditioning, which makes it not worth the money. 1201 is also known around campus as 120 Fun do to the excessive partying going on which makes this a not very good option even though it is the cheapest of the four., 513030=We are adding another food court for fall 2013 so that will make it even better on campus!, 898278=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 490717=Go to movies, parties at 1201, go out to eat, hang around downtown...., 348003=IUPUI is always looking to grow and in Fall 2013 there will be a new dorm/apartment open to students. The ever expanding student housing will increase student life at IUPUI and we will be more of a traditional campus., 506312=Our campus every year has the Regatta. This is an event in September where each organization creates their own crew and they race down the canal that is located downtown. Many sponsors come and offer free samples for the students, all different kinds organizations are there, and it's a great way to meet downtown, students, and professors as well. This is free for anyone so I always invite my family., 412170=As of 2012, IUPUI offers only food-court style dining options, however, a new dining hall will be added in 2013 that will feature tradition dinning-hall cuisine., 677130=Food and dining has improved greatly over the past few years since the new campus center was built! Before, the only canteen was located in what is no one of the main buildings but now the new campus center offers a lunch and eating area that has several chain eateries (Papa John', Chick Filla) and other campus places such as Simmer and Caribou Coffee. These places offer vegetarian options and breakfast for those who do not eat meat or do not want to eat anything that is fried. The only problem is that some of the places close a bit too early, sometimes at 3:00 on regular school hours. The main campus eatery does stay open longer but it offers fewer chances. If the campus options do not fit your need, there are plenty of other places to get food around campus, either near Indiana Avenue, Wishard Hospital, and Downtown. The price ranges can vary but they do increase your eating choices. Because the campus is also on the busline, you can get Downtown easily for a bite to eat and make it back on campus just in time for classes., 213035=Come 2013, there will be three new dorm facilities.}",

Tips for prospective students Do well from beginning to end! Do not wait til the end of the semester to try and bring your grades up. If you give your all from the start, you will not have to stress and struggle at the end. Bang for the buck IUPUI is not the cheapest university and it is for from the most expensive. I would say one year's tution without room and board would be around $6,000. Am enjoying being here",
