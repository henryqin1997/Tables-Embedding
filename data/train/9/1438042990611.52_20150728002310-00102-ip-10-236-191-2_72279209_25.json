Balancing Method Multi-Fund Accounts Receivable Related Topics NSF wants to receive the invoice for their funding dollars in a single invoice. In the Big Think ledger, the General, Operating, and the Trust funds are represented by the balancing fund segment values 100, 200, and 300. NSF provides funding for the General Fund, Operating Fund, and Trust Fund of Big Think Tank. The following conditions exist in this example: For example, a non-profit research group, Big Think Tank Institute, must issue approximately 30 invoices per week to various foundations, endowments, and government agency grants for funding of its continued operations. Typically, one funding agency, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), provides money for several operational funds operated by Big Think Tank.
