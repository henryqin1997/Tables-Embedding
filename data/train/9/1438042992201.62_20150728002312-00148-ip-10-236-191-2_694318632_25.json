Several parties called to express their interest in acquiring the Company., 169542=If the merger is completed, the common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

The Deutsche Bank opinion is addressed to, and for the use and benefit of, the board of directors (including any members thereof who are also members of the transaction committee in their capacities as members of the transaction committee). The Deutsche Bank opinion is not a recommendation to the holders of the common stock to adopt the merger agreement. The Deutsche Bank opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share merger consideration to the holders of the common stock (excluding Parent, Merger Sub and their affiliates). Deutsche Bank was not asked to, and the Deutsche Bank opinion did not, address the fairness of the merger, or any consideration received in connection therewith, to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies, nor did it address the fairness of the contemplated benefits of the merger. Deutsche Bank expressed no opinion as to the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared to alternative business strategies, nor did it express any opinion as to how any holders of the common stock should vote with respect to the merger. Deutsche Bank did not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the Company\u0092s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the merger relative to the merger consideration to be received by the holders of the common stock.

From that day until the merger agreement and related documents were executed on November 5, the parties and their respective representatives negotiated the terms of the definitive documents. Significant issues discussed included price, the right of the Company to affirmatively seek higher offers after entering into the merger agreement, the nature and amount of the financial commitment the guarantors were prepared to make to the Company through the Parent fee and limited guarantee, the requirements for commencement of the debt marketing period and limitations on the availability of specific performance against Parent and Merger Sub., 350146=the Company\u0092s ability, under the merger agreement, during the period beginning on the date of the merger agreement and continuing until 12:01 a.m., New York time, on December\u00a021, 2009 to initiate, solicit and encourage alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and negotiate with third parties with respect to such proposals;, 624979=July 2008, 1055911=Under our bylaws, and as permitted by SEC rules, certain procedures are provided that a stockholder must follow to nominate persons for election as directors or to introduce an item of business at an annual meeting of stockholders. These procedures provide that nominations for director nominees and/or an item of business to be introduced at an annual meeting of stockholders must be submitted in writing to the Corporate Secretary of IMS at 901 Main Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut 06851. We must receive the notice of your intention to introduce a nomination or proposed item of business at our 2010 annual meeting no earlier than January\u00a031, 2010, and no later than February\u00a020, 2010., 31008=1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November\u00a05, 2009, as it may be amended from time to time, which we refer to as the merger agreement, by and among the Company, Healthcare Technology Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which we refer to as Parent, and Healthcare Technology Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to the accompanying proxy statement., 759484=Under the HSR Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder by the FTC, the merger cannot be completed until each of the Company and Parent file a notification and report form with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. The Company and Parent have filed such notification and report forms on November\u00a019, 2009 and each has requested early termination of the waiting period. The FTC has not yet notified the parties whether their request for early termination of the applicable waiting period has been granted. At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the Company or Parent. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the Company or Parent. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances., 1124743=Information that are available to Parent and Merger Sub on the first day of any such 35-day period would be required to be updated pursuant to Rule\u00a03-12 of Regulation S-X on any day during such 35-day period if a registration statement using such financial statements were to be filed with the SEC on such date, then a new 35-day period shall commence; it being understood and agreed that on and after February\u00a012, 2010, the Marketing Period shall be deemed not to commence unless the Company has delivered to Parent and Merger Sub audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at and for the fiscal year ended on December\u00a031, 2009 of the type otherwise required in the Required Bank Information., 620363=Deutsche Bank also determined an estimated Price Per Share to 2010E EPS reference range of 10.0x to 14.0x and applied such range to the Company\u0092s estimated 2010 earnings per share, which we refer to as 2010E EPS, resulting in a range of implied Price Per Share for the Company from $14.63 to $20.49; and, 627875=December 2006, 632277=December 2000, 640829=Deutsche Bank applied the Price to Forward EPS reference range of 10.0x to 14.0x to the Company\u0092s estimated 2012 earnings per share at a two year forward future value date. Deutsche Bank then discounted to the present the range of implied per share values for the common stock from the future value date using Deutsche Bank\u0092s estimated cost of equity capital for the Company of 13%. Based on the foregoing, Deutsche Bank calculated a range of implied current Price Per Share for the Company from $13.93 to $19.50., 287476=From time to time over the last few years, a number of parties, including TPG and a consortium consisting of two other private equity firms, which we refer to collectively as Bidder A, have approached David R.

With respect to the selected companies and the Company, Foros compared:, 315521=On October 28, 2009, the transaction committee held another meeting with representatives from Foros, Deutsche Bank, Sullivan & Cromwell and Morris Nichols. At this meeting, the transaction committee discussed the desirability of the transaction committee engaging another financial advisor for the purposes of rendering a fairness opinion with respect to a potential transaction, a possibility that had initially been discussed at the October 23, 2009 meeting of the transaction committee., 257905=We have fixed the close of business on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 2010 as the record date for the special meeting, and only holders of record of common stock on the record date are entitled to vote at the special meeting. You are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting if you owned shares of common stock at the close of business on the record date. On the record date, there were \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters properly coming before the special meeting., 319998=On November 3, 2009, the transaction committee held a special meeting to discuss the proposals received that day. Certain members of senior management and representatives of Foros, Deutsche Bank, Lazard, Sullivan & Cromwell and Morris Nichols also participated in the meeting. The transaction committee discussed among other things the terms of the proposals, the time the bidders other than the TPG/CPPIB Group would require to complete diligence, the likelihood that such bidders would submit a viable proposal with a price higher than the price offered by TPG/CPPIB Group\u0092s proposal following such diligence, the risk that the TPG/CPPIB Group would not agree to a transaction if the Company did not move promptly towards execution of an agreement and the fact that the TPG/CPPIB bid continued to include a \u0093go-shop\u0094 provision. Following that discussion, the transaction committee determined that moving forward with the terms contained in the TPG/CPPIB Group\u0092s offer at a price of $22.00 per share would be in the best interests of the Company\u0092s stockholders. The transaction, 644658=Fifty-Two Week Trading Range. Deutsche Bank reviewed the historical trading price for the common stock during the 12-month period ended October\u00a016, 2009, the last trading day prior to public speculation that the Company was considering its strategic alternatives.

The full text of the written opinion, dated November\u00a05, 2009, of Foros, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 649647=The board of directors selected Deutsche Bank as financial advisor in connection with the merger based on Deutsche Bank\u0092s qualifications, expertise, reputation and experience in mergers and acquisitions. The Company has retained Deutsche Bank pursuant to a letter agreement dated November\u00a03, 2009, which we refer to as the engagement letter. As compensation for Deutsche Bank\u0092s services in connection with the merger, the Company has agreed to pay a transaction fee of approximately $24 million contingent on the consummation of the merger and reduced by the amount of any opinion fees paid by the Company to Deutsche Bank. In addition, the Company has agreed to pay an opinion fee of $2 million upon delivery of a fairness opinion (or upon Deutsche Bank advising the board it would be unable to deliver an opinion), and additional opinion fees of $2.5 million upon delivery of any additional opinions (or upon Deutsche Bank advising the board it would be unable to deliver such additional opinion). Regardless of whether the merger is consummated, the Company has agreed to reimburse Deutsche Bank for reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of Deutsche Bank\u0092s counsel and all of Deutsche Bank\u0092s reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the merger or otherwise arising out of the engagement of Deutsche Bank under the engagement letter. The Company has also agreed to indemnify Deutsche Bank and certain related persons to the full extent lawful against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws arising out of its engagement or the merger., 305650=Of the parties contacted by representatives of Foros and Deutsche Bank, 14 parties were sent a form of confidentiality agreement prepared by representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell. Eight of the interested private equity firms (and no potential strategic acquirors) executed confidentiality agreements. Those confidentiality agreements, among other things, prohibited the firms from forming consortia without the Company\u0092s consent. Following execution of the confidentiality agreements, the interested parties were provided the same level of access to non-public information that had been provided to the TPG/CPPIB Group and Bidder A. Representatives of Foros, at the direction of the independent directors, delivered a bid instruction letter to each of these eight interested parties. Based on feedback that many of the interested parties could provide bids within ten days to two weeks, the bid instruction letter requested final proposals from these parties on November 3, 2009., 289346=In late August 2009, representatives of Bidder A contacted a representative of Deutsche Bank and expressed an interest in the Company.

It is expected that at the closing $1 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes will be issued pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or another private placement exemption in lieu of the senior unsecured term loans. Goldman Sachs may invite other institutional lenders to participate in the debt financing described in the debt commitment letter and to undertake a portion of the commitment to provide such financing., 581281=In preparing its opinion, Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for the independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any information, whether publicly available or furnished to it, concerning the Company, including, without limitation, any financial information, forecasts or projections, considered in connection with the rendering of its opinion.

With respect to the Company forecasts, Deutsche Bank assumed, with the board of directors\u0092 permission, that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby. In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank expressed no view as to the reasonableness of such Company forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based. The Deutsche Bank opinion was necessarily based upon the economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Deutsche Bank, as of November 5, 2009.

Several hours later, representatives of the TPG/CPPIB Group informed representatives of Deutsche Bank that the TPG/CPPIB Group was willing to increase the amount of the Parent fee to $275 million (approximately 6.9 percent of the aggregate consideration to be paid to holders of common stock based on the $22.00 per share offer price), and to increase its equity commitment by $50 million. Representatives of Deutsche Bank, Sullivan & Cromwell and Morris Nichols then briefed representatives of Foros regarding the discussions held with the TPG/CPPIB Group earlier that morning. Representatives of Foros then contacted representatives of the TPG/CPPIB Group to again request an increase in the Parent fee to $300 million. Representatives of the TPG/CPPIB Group reiterated that the TPG/CPPIB Group was only willing to accept a Parent fee of $275 million., 316631=On October 30, 2009, the transaction committee held a meeting to discuss the strategic review process. Representatives from Foros, Deutsche Bank, Sullivan & Cromwell, Morris Nichols and Lazard participated in this meeting.

On November\u00a06, 2009, a putative stockholder class action, styled Trust for the Benefit of Sylvia B. Piven v. IMS Health Incorporated, et al, CV09-5013110-S, was filed in the Superior Court of Connecticut against the Company, the members of its board of directors, TPG and CPPIB, asserting the directors breached their fiduciary duties, and asserting that TPG and CPPIB aided and abetted those alleged breaches of duty. On November\u00a09, 2009, a putative stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company, the members of the board of directors, Parent, Merger Sub, TPG and CPPIB.

Among other remedies, the complaints in the five actions seek to enjoin the merger., 686411=Parent has entered into an equity commitment letter with the guarantors, dated November\u00a05, 2009 pursuant to which the guarantors have committed, severally but not jointly, to make or secure capital contributions to Parent for an aggregate of $2.793\u00a0billion. The guarantors may assign a portion of equity to other investors, although such assignment will not affect the guarantors\u0092 commitments to make or secure capital contributions pursuant to the equity commitment letter. Each guarantor may allocate all or a portion of its investment in Parent to other persons or entities, and its commitment under the equity commitment letter will be reduced by any amounts actually contributed to Parent by such persons or entities on or before the effective time. The funding of financing contemplated by the equity commitment is generally subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent\u0092s and Merger Sub\u0092s obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the substantially contemporaneous funding of the debt financing pursuant to its terms and conditions or any alternative financing that Parent and Merger Sub are required to accept pursuant to the merger agreement.

The revised offer from the TPG/CPPIB Group was not subject to any additional diligence review., 524841=Illustrative Leveraged Buyout Analysis. Foros performed an illustrative leveraged buyout analysis for the Company using the Company forecasts. In performing the illustrative leveraged buyout analysis, Foros assumed a range of hypothetical financial buyer purchase prices per share of the common stock of $20.00 to $23.00 and assumed leverage equal to 5.0x estimated EBITDA for calendar year 2009. This analysis was based on an assumed exit at the end of 2014 and a range of illustrative one year forward exit EBITDA multiples of 7.0x to 9.0x, which reflect illustrative implied prices at which a hypothetical financial buyer might exit its investment through a sale transaction. This analysis resulted in illustrative internal rates of equity returns to a hypothetical financial buyer ranging from 6.3% to 18.5%. Using the Company forecasts, Foros also performed a sensitivity analysis on the illustrative leveraged buyout analysis to analyze the effect of hypothetical Company annual operating expense reductions ranging from $50 million to $100 million. This sensitivity analysis resulted in illustrative internal rates of equity returns to a hypothetical financial buyer ranging from 8.7% to 22.9%., 469510=the median of the selected U.S. pharmaceutical companies\u0092 P/E ratios, as adjusted to exclude one-time expenses, for calendar year 2010 (as calculated in the selected companies analysis, described above)., 580120=reviewed the terms of the merger agreement and certain related documents, including the equity commitment letter dated November\u00a05, 2009, the limited guarantee dated November\u00a05, 2009 and the debt commitment letter dated November\u00a05, 2009; and, 428871=P/E ratio to estimated earnings annual long-term growth rate (P/E/G) ratios, as adjusted to exclude one-time expenses, for calendar years 2009 and 2010., 717538=Based on the Company\u0092s equity compensation holdings as of December\u00a031, 2009, and assuming that the merger is completed on February\u00a026, 2010, upon completion of the merger, (1)\u00a0the number of unvested stock appreciation rights of the Company (at exercise prices ranging from $13.43 to $22.58) held by each of Messrs.

In reaching its determination, the transaction committee consulted with and received the advice of its independent financial and legal advisors, members of the board of directors not on the transaction committee, our senior management team, as well as our outside legal and financial advisors and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors:, 20197=On November\u00a05, 2009, the Company entered into a merger agreement providing for the acquisition of the Company by Healthcare Technology Holdings, Inc., an entity created by certain affiliates of TPG Capital, L.P. and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement., 676769=In addition to those financial forecasts, the Company provided its board of directors, the transaction committee and their respective advisors with a set of financial forecasts it called a \u0091downside case\u0092 (a sensitivity case which reflects slower growth of the Company\u0092s core products and services in the period beyond 2010 and lower growth than the financial forecasts summarized above in terms of revenue from planned new products and services and therefore lower Gross Profit, EBITDA and Total Operating Income) and another set of financial forecasts it called an \u0091upside case\u0092 (a sensitivity case which reflects faster growth of the Company\u0092s core products and services in the period beyond 2010 and incremental growth above the financial forecasts summarized above in terms of revenue from planned new products and services and therefore higher Gross Profit, EBITDA and Total Operating Income). Those financial forecasts were not furnished to the TPG/CPPIB Group or other interested bidders and are accordingly not included herein., 910267=if the effective time occurs in 2010, provide pro rata payout of 2010 bonuses and maintain an annual bonus plan for the remainder of the year on the same terms and conditions as applied before the effective time, providing for the payment of bonuses following the end of 2010 according to the same targets and performance measures, but reduced by the earlier pro rata payout; and, 551528=Based on the Company forecasts provided to Lazard by the Company\u0092s management, Lazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company based on the present value of forecasted unlevered free cash flows for fiscal years ending December\u00a031, 2010 through 2013 and the present value of a terminal value, discounted to December\u00a031, 2009. Lazard calculated the estimated terminal values for the Company by applying a range of one-year forward EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) terminal value multiples of 6.0x to 8.0x to the Company\u0092s 2014 estimated EBITDA.

The EC could prohibit the completion of the merger or seek divestiture of substantial assets of the Company or Parent as a condition for allowing the completion of the merger., 107528=Parent has entered into an equity commitment letter with TPG Partners V, L.P., TPG Partners VI, L.P. and CPP Investment Board Private Holdings Inc., which we refer to collectively as the guarantors, dated November\u00a05, 2009, pursuant to which the guarantors have committed, severally but not jointly, to make or secure capital contributions to Parent for an aggregate of $2.793\u00a0billion. The guarantors may assign a portion of equity to other investors, although such assignment will not affect the guarantors\u0092 commitments to make or secure capital contributions pursuant to the equity commitment letter. The funding of financing contemplated by the equity commitment is generally subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent\u0092s and Merger Sub\u0092s obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the substantially contemporaneous funding of the debt financing pursuant to its terms and conditions or any alternative financing that Parent and Merger Sub are required to accept pursuant to the merger agreement.

Goldman Sachs may invite other institutional lenders to participate in the debt financing described in the debt commitment letter and to undertake a portion of the commitment to provide such financing., 730499=Based on the executives\u0092 compensation levels as of December\u00a031, 2009, and assuming that the merger is completed on February\u00a026, 2010, and the executive experiences a qualifying termination immediately thereafter, the amount of the cash severance payment (including the pro rata target annual bonus payment in (1)\u00a0above) that would be payable to Ms.\u00a0Katz, Mr.\u00a0Knightly and the seven other executive officers (as a group) is approximately $2,083,726, $1,342,313 and $7,580,968, respectively, the estimated value of the health and life insurance benefits they would receive is $656,554, $762,772 and $4,703,357, respectively and the estimated value of the outplacement benefits they would receive is $100,000, $100,000 and $671,720, respectively.

Foros utilized the following P/E multiples for this analysis:, 309645=On October 24, 2009, the transaction committee held a meeting to continue its discussion of the status of the strategic review process and the revised proposal from the TPG/CPPIB Group. Representatives of Deutsche Bank, Foros, Sullivan & Cromwell and Morris Nichols also participated in this meeting. The transaction committee was informed that Foros, at the direction of the transaction committee, had continued its outreach to potential strategic transaction partners and other private equity groups. The transaction committee discussed at length the TPG/CPPIB Group\u0092s revised proposal, including the improved certainty regarding the funding of the debt financing contemplated by financing commitment documents as compared to the TPG/CPPIB Group\u0092s prior proposal, and the potential impact of the deadline imposed by the TPG/CPPIB Group on the strategic review process. In particular, the transaction committee discussed the importance of continuing the strategic review process that was underway, the risk that the TPG/CPPIB Group would not agree to a transaction if the Company ignored the TPG/CPPIB Group deadline and did not move more promptly towards execution of an agreement, and ways to strike an appropriate balance between these two countervailing issues., 158979=the Company may be obligated to pay a termination fee of $115 million (or $80 million, if the merger agreement is terminated in connection with an alternative acquisition agreement entered into prior to 12:01 a.m., New York time, on December\u00a021, 2009) and reimburse the out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub up to $5 million; or, 1056740=If, however, the date of our 2010 annual meeting is advanced more than 20\u00a0days, or delayed more than 70\u00a0days, from May\u00a01, 2010, we must receive notice no earlier than 90\u00a0days prior to the 2010 annual meeting date and no later than the close of business (i)\u00a070\u00a0days prior to the 2010 annual meeting date, or (ii)\u00a0the tenth\u00a0day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made, whichever is later., 322664=On November 4, 2009, the transaction committee held a special meeting to continue its consideration of the proposals received the prior day. Certain members of senior management and representatives of Foros, Deutsche Bank, Lazard, Sullivan & Cromwell and Morris Nichols also participated in the meeting. At this meeting, representatives of Foros and Deutsche Bank reviewed certain preliminary financial analyses with the transaction committee. Following these presentations, the transaction committee reiterated its previous instructions to management of the Company not to discuss any equity participation or compensation arrangements with the TPG/CPPIB Group until permitted to do so by the transaction committee. The transaction committee also instructed representatives from Foros to prepare to make contacts with potential transaction partners during the \u0093go-shop\u0094 period if a merger agreement with the TPG/CPPIB Group was executed., 701868=The debt commitments will terminate upon the first to occur of (i)\u00a0the consummation of the merger, (ii)\u00a0the termination by Parent of the merger agreement, (iii)\u00a0a material breach by Parent of its obligations with respect to the syndication or the payment of fees owed by Parent, and (iv)\u00a0midnight New York City time on May\u00a026, 2010, provided that under certain circumstances described in the merger agreement such date shall be automatically extended by up to two business days, unless the closing of the facilities, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter, has been consummated on or before such date.

The implied premiums in this analysis were calculated by comparing the per share transaction price to the closing price of the target company\u0092s stock as of one day, five days and 20 days prior to the announcement of the merger, as well as the 52-week high and the 52-week low price of the target company\u0092s stock prior to the announcement of the merger. The results of these calculations are set forth in the following table:, 2496=the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 776648=The marketing period is the first period of 35 consecutive days following the date of the merger agreement beginning on the later of (i)\u00a0delivery by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub and their financing sources of certain financial statements specified by the debt commitment letter and any other information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries to the extent reasonably requested by Parent to prepare a confidential information memorandum and lender presentation that are contemplated by the debt commitment letter (which information we refer to as the required bank information), and (ii)\u00a014 days after the date of the later of the meetings with certain rating agencies with respect to the debt facilities contemplated by the debt commitment letter, throughout which 35-day period (a)\u00a0Parent has received the required bank information and (b)\u00a0the closing conditions relating to the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders, receipt of required antitrust approvals or expiration or early termination of applicable antitrust waiting periods and absence of any law prohibiting the consummation of the merger or otherwise making consummation of the merger illegal have been satisfied and nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would prevent any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub from being satisfied if the closing of the merger were to occur at any time during such 35-day period. Certain days around Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year\u0092s Day will not be included in determining such 35-day requirement and if the marketing period has not ended prior to December\u00a018, 2009 it will not commence earlier than January\u00a05, 2010. If the Company in good faith reasonably believes it has delivered the required bank information, it may deliver to Parent a written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery), in which case the marketing period will be deemed to have commenced on the date of such notice unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not completed delivery of the required bank information and, within four business days after the delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect. In addition, the marketing period will not be deemed to have commenced if before the completion of the marketing period, (i)\u00a0PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP withdraws its audit opinion with respect to any of the financial statements contained in our filings with the SEC since January\u00a01, 2007, (ii)\u00a0we publicly announce any intention to restate any material financial information included in the required bank information or that any such restatement is under consideration, in which case the marketing period will be deemed not to commence at the earliest unless and until such restatement has been completed and the relevant reports have been amended or the Company has determined that no restatement is required, or (iii)\u00a0we are delinquent in filing any material report with the SEC required under the Exchange Act, in which case the marketing period will be deemed not to commence at the earliest unless and until such delinquency is cured. Further, in certain cases if the financial statements included in the required bank information would be required to be updated under the SEC rules if a registration statement using such financial statements were to be filed with the SEC on any day during such 35-day period, then a new 35-day period will commence. On and after February\u00a012, 2010, the marketing period will be deemed not to commence unless we deliver to Parent and Merger Sub audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the fiscal year ended on December\u00a031, 2009., 313357=On October 25, 2009, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell sent representatives of the TPG/CPPIB Group and Ropes & Gray written comments on the proposed debt financing commitment documents.

Foros also calculated illustrative terminal values as of December\u00a031, 2014 based on an assumed perpetuity growth rate ranging from 3.0% to 5.0% and assumed terminal year unlevered free cash flows of $463.7 million based on 7% growth in revenue and constant EBITDA margins. These illustrative terminal values were then discounted to December\u00a031, 2009 to calculate the implied present value using a discount rate of 11%. Foros then added the implied present values of the unlevered free cash flows for calendar years 2010 through 2014 to the range of implied present values of the illustrative terminal values to arrive at an implied per share equity reference range of $19.41 to $26.07 for the common stock., 20703=If the merger contemplated by the merger agreement is completed, you will be entitled to receive $22.00 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock owned by you (unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights with respect to such shares), which represents a premium of approximately 50% to the closing price of the Company\u0092s common stock on October\u00a016, 2009, the last trading day prior to public speculation that the Company was considering its strategic alternatives and a premium of approximately 31% to the closing price of the Company\u0092s common stock on November\u00a04, 2009, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement., 872463=Until 12:01 a.m., New York time, on December\u00a021, 2009 we are permitted to:, 627155=March 2007, 595077=the ratio of common equity market capitalization plus total debt and minority interests less cash to estimated 2009 EBITDA, which we refer to as Enterprise Value to 2009E EBITDA;, 137441=The merger agreement allows us to solicit any inquiry or the making of any acquisition proposals from third parties and to participate in any negotiations or discussions with third parties with respect to any acquisition proposals until 12:01 a.m., New York time, on December\u00a021, 2009.

Several members of senior management and representatives from Deutsche Bank, Foros and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, the Company\u0092s outside legal counsel, which we refer to as Sullivan & Cromwell, participated in this meeting. Mr. Carlucci reviewed the terms of the indications of interest from the TPG/CPPIB Group and Bidder A with the board of directors and discussed an update on the Company\u0092s performance and latest long-range plan based on the budgeting work performed during the time since the July 20, 2009 meeting of the board of directors. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and Foros also discussed the improvements in the debt and equity capital markets since the July 20, 2009 meeting of the board of directors. A representative from Sullivan & Cromwell also reviewed with the board of directors their fiduciary duties under applicable law. The board of directors and their advisers then discussed the viability of these indications of interest in light of the extreme volatility of the debt and equity capital markets over the past 12 months and the more recent improvements in both the debt and equity capital markets. Following these discussions, the board of directors authorized management of the Company to explore the viability of the transactions proposed by the TPG/CPPIB Group and Bidder A, and to seek to better understand the assumptions underlying the range of prices indicated by the TPG/CPPIB Group and Bidder A and the ability of the TPG/CPPIB Group and Bidder A to secure the necessary debt financing. In connection with such exploration, the board of directors authorized management to provide the TPG/CPPIB Group and Bidder A access to confidential information concerning the Company under appropriate confidentiality agreements in order to help them refine their respective valuations of the Company and confirm the availability of sufficient financing. The board of directors also discussed whether the Company should seek indications of interest from potential acquirors other than the TPG/CPPIB Group and Bidder A. The board of directors determined not to seek indications of interest from other potential acquirors prior to determining whether the indications of interest received from the TPG/CPPIB Group and Bidder A were viable, including whether the TPG/CPPIB Group or Bidder A would be able to secure the necessary debt financing in light of the uncertain state of the debt markets., 811407=our SEC filings since January\u00a01, 2007 and the financial statements included therein;, 572802=Deutsche Bank acted as financial advisor to the board of directors in connection with the merger.
