            "The majority of the courses taken here were not worth their money. As an education major, I was hoping to take classes that would prepare me for my future career as a teacher. However, this university is only concerned with how their graduates look to other competing districts and university systems around the country, so their course loads are filled with fluff assignments and information so that they can say they taught you something that may or may not actually help you. Also, the only time I had actual tenured professors teach me was when I was in my higher up courses. They make you pay thousands of dollars to be taught by inexperienced graduate students until your last year at their university. Their focus is skewed and you will become one of the masses when you attend here.",
            "UNLV does not care about you, so you should not waste your time, money, energy, or any other precious thing that you have with them. Do not attend this university unless you are rich and have clout, or are bored with your life and don't care that you will get screwed royally when it comes down to it.",
            "UNLV is an ineffective, greedy, and disrespectful university that teaches you nothing but to distrust the system that you are a part of. This university has a biased system of professors and higher-ups that focus on how to make money rather than give their students a good education, which was my understanding of a university in itself. I have faced nothing but grief and adversity when obtaining my degree from here, and would highly recommend running as fast as you can away from this school."

If you are an out of state student, avoid this school like the plague. However, if you go to a Las Vegas high school and qualify for the Guinn Millennium Scholarship, you will pay only 1500-2500 dollars per semester, which is far below average. In other words, if you are local, have that scholarship, and only care about getting a degree so you can go to grad school, this is the place. But don't expect to have a exceptional learning environment., 745531=Apply early! There are MANY benefits offered for those who apply to UNLV by February. For example, there are a lot of scholarships that can pay for most, if not all, of your tuition. Talk to the financial aid office about grants offered by the school as well as other scholarships awarded by the program you're majoring in. Either way, you will be able to have at least some of your tuition paid off at UNLV., 1058196=Excited to be joining UNLV to study hospitality management with a concentration in PGA Golf. Attended an excellent and well organized orientation in June., 27451=I am already enrolled at UNLV to begin my first semester in the Spring of 2011. I have many friends who attended UNLV for the Fall semester & from what I have heard, the classes are packed full of learning experiences. They require much work, focus & concentration. The professors are very knowledgeable on the subjects which they teach, & they are willing help if you get lost. Overall, students at UNLV undoubtedly learn a lot in their time spent at the university., 470645=I feel that they do not support their Geology program very well, There on-campus housing needs to be remodeled. They do not treat everyone equally I know this as I worked in the Enrollment and Student Services office and I was able to see what goes on behind the scenes. I rate them a 4 out of 10 I am currenlty finishing my last semester with UNLV online this fall and starting with Metropolitan College of Denver Spring 2013, 217404=If you are a commuter and willing to stay on campus until 6:30 PM for a meeting, once a month, then I would say the clubs are a great thing. To those living on campus it is definitely more convenient because they are within walking distance., 1060679=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 1023468=There's plenty of people on campus throughout the whole entire day. I have a class that doesn't end until 7:30 at night and there's still plenty of other students walking around campus. However, if there isn't a lot of people around, there are security guards constantly patrolling the campus, and there are emergency call boxes on every corner for students to pick up and it will notify campus police that they need help.}",

After all, there are thousands of hotels in Las Vegas, this would be the best place to learn about hotel management. However, UNLV does have good programs in the health sciences college, education college and sciences college. Tips for prospective students UNLV is a really good school. There are great teachers, some may be graduate students so they know what you are going through and may be even more helpful than professors. I would recommend this school to anyone. Bang for the buck I know a lot of people who went out of state for schools, and if you are a in state student, going to UNLV should be your number one choice. There are",
