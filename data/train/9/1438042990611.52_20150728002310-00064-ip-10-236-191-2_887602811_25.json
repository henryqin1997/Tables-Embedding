            "Campus safety is great there, they have their own police officers and they came to help me when I locked my keys in my car very promptly.",
            "I wish I could have the quality of education of Kent State and the surroundings of Roanoke, but there just isn't an affordable middle without a scholarship.",
            "They have huge computer screens you can plug your laptop into, it would be good for studying or watching movies in your free time. It is also close to downtown Roanoke where there is lots of things to do.",
            "The food is good and the Domino's pizza is delicious!",
            "I don't live on campus.",
            "I want to do well in two out of my three classes because the teachers actually help you out and answer e-mails. My third class is biology 101 and my teacher has never taught before and has not a clue how to do it.",
            "Keep in mind that it is a community college and you will probably get a better education at a four year college than here, but not everything about it is bad.",
            "Virginia Western is a very nice school, but it's staff and teachers are disorganized. I didn't realize how good I had it at Kent State until I realized all the teachers weren't like the ones there. I love the other students there, they are very nice."
