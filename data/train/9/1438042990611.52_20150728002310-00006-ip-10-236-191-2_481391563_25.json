Essentially mX and oX were not adsorbed on the silicalite, but passed through and were collected into the first silica trap. When the silicalite bed became saturated with pX and EB, the flow of xylenes was discontinued and He purged through the bed. The effluent was then switched to the second silica trap and the temperature of the silicalite bed increased to 300\ufffd C. to desorb the adsorbed hydrocarbons. The adsorbed materials were recovered from the two silica beds and analyzed for C8 aromatics. The analysis is given in Table 4. The results show that in a mixture of EB and xylenes, pX and EB are selectively adsorbed on silicalite, while mX and oX are essentially not adsorbed.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{149587=[0165] The pressure swing adsorption process is carried out in the vapor phase. Preferred conditions for the process include temperatures from about 350\ufffd F. (176\ufffd C.) to about 750\ufffd F. (400\ufffd C.), preferably from about 400\ufffd F. to about 750\ufffd F. (about 205\ufffd C. to about 400\ufffd C.); more preferably from about 450\ufffd F. (230\ufffd C.) to about 750\ufffd F. (400\ufffd C.), more preferably from about 500\ufffd F. (250\ufffd C.) to about 750\ufffd F. (400\ufffd C.), more preferably, from about 600\ufffd F. (315\ufffd C.) to about 700\ufffd F. (370\ufffd C.), sufficient to maintain components in the vapor phase at system pressures from about 30 psia (206 kPa) to about 400 psia (2760 kPa), preferably from about 100 psia (690 kPa) to about 400 psia (2760 kPa), more preferably from about 150 psia (1030 kPa) to about 350 psia (2410 kPa), more preferably, from about 200 psia (1380 kPa) to about 300 psia (2070 kPa). The process is conducted at a substantially isothermal temperature., 135311=[0147] Those skilled in the art will recognize that suitable operating temperatures and pressures for achieving sufficiently rapid adsorption and desorption in the PSA process may vary. For example the temperature and pressure may be in the ranges of about 350\ufffd F. (176\ufffd C.) to about 750\ufffd F. (400\ufffd C.) and about 30 psia (206 kPa), to about 400 psia (2760 kPa); more preferably about 400\ufffd F. (200\ufffd C.) to about 650\ufffd F. (350\ufffd C.) and about 50 psia (345 kPa) to about 300 psia (2070 kPa); more preferably about 450\ufffd F. (225\ufffd C.) to about 600\ufffd F. (300\ufffd C.) and about 50 psia (345 kPa) to about 250 psia (1380 kPa)., 212489=[0280] Silicalite was prepared by adding 18.4 g NaOH to 227.6 g H2O. After dissolution, 12.8 g tetrapropylammonium bromide was dissolved and 122.6 g Nalco 2327 silica sol was added and stirred for 2 hours. Concentrated H2SO4 was slowly added to achieve a pH of 13. The resulting solution was heated under autogenous pressure in a Teflon-lined autoclave for 1-7 days at 300\ufffd F.(150\ufffd C.). The crystals were filtered and washed to a neutral pH filtrate. An SEM micrograph of the sieve powder is shown in FIG. 8., 142285=[0158] In the present invention a preferred adsorbent is silicalite molecular sieve, comprising orthorhombic crystals having an average minimum dimension of around 0.2 \u03bcm or greater, which has high para-xylene and ethylbenzene selectivity. The para-xylene adsorption capacity of the silicalite adsorbent is from about 1 to about 15 wt %. at saturation. Adsorbent capacity is typically defined as grams adsorbate (i.e., material adsorbed) divided by grams adsorbent and can also be expressed as a weight percent by multiplying by 100. The process is conducted in the gas phase at a temperature of from about 350\ufffd F. to about 750\ufffd F. (about 176\ufffd C. to about 400\ufffd C.) and the unit pressure is about 30 to about 400 psia (about 206 kPa to about 2760 kPa)., 77348=[0025] Specific examples of molecular sieves include ZSM-5 (MFI structure type) and ZSM-11 (MEL structure type) and related isotypic structures. Since suitable adsorbents should not be catalytically reactive to components in the feedstream, the preferable adsorbent useful in this invention is silicalite (MFI structure type), an essentially all silica molecular sieve, which contains minimal amounts of aluminum or other substituted elements. Typically, the silica/alumina ratio of suitable silicalite is above 200 and may range above 1000 depending on the contaminant level of aluminum used in the sieve's preparation. Other MFI and MEL sieves may be used to the extent they are made non-catalytically active. MFI-based molecular sieves are preferred in this invention with silicalite as the most preferred. Other potentially useful adsorbents include structure types MTT, FER, EUO, MFS, TON, AEL, ATO, NES, and others with similar pore sizes., 182939=[0245] Examples of crystallization processes which could be used as the crystallization component of the PSA-crystallization process of the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,985,694; 3,729,523; 5,284,992, 5,329,060; 5,448,055, 3,177,265, 3,467,724, 3,662,013, 5,992,924, 6,111,1611, and 6,147,272 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties., 255551=[0298] A 1:1:1:1 mixture of pX:EB:mX:oX at a total pressure of 89 psig and 38.6 psi partial pressure of C8 aromatics (1995 torr) was passed over the silicalite (4) adsorbent at 250\ufffd C. The effluent composition was monitored by gas chromatography (GC). As in Example 1, when the silicalite adsorbent bed is saturated with a given isomer, the concentration of that isomer in the vapor phase at the bed outlet quickly increased to the inlet vapor phase concentration. The time required to detect that isomer at the bed outlet is proportional to the amount adsorbed on the bed., 175054=[0234] The separation and purification process component used in connection with the above toluene conversion processes also generally fall into two categories: crystallization or liquid-phase, adsorption chromatography (SiMBAC). The former was initially developed by Amoco with subsequent improvements, modifications, or incorporations by others. See, for example, the following patents: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,329,060; 5,448,005; 5,866,740; 6,111,161; 6,114,592; 6,147,272; and WO 96/22262 (all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). Liquid-phase adsorption chromatography, also referred to as simulated moving bed adsorption chromatography (SiMBAC), is commercially licensed by UOP and IFP. SiMBAC processes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,985,589; 3,201,491; 3,626,020; 3,696,107; 3,729,523; 4,039,599; 4,184,943; 4,381,419; 4,402,832 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. It is widely recognized that, next to the feedstock costs, the separation and purification portions comprise the most expensive component of the PX production process., 173797=[0230] Operating conditions for above the toluene disproportionation process generally include a temperature of 350-540\ufffd C., preferably greater than 400\ufffd C., a pressure of 100 to 35000 kPa (atmospheric to 5000 psig), preferably 800 to 7000 kPa (100 to 1000 psig), a WHSV of 0.1-20, preferably 2-4, and a hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio of 0.1-20, preferably 2-4. This process may be conducted in either fixed- or fluid-bed mode with attendant benefits of either operation readily obtainable., 173276=[0229] As taught in WO 93/17987, toluene disproportionation may be carried out in a fixed-bed reactor using 2 grams of a silica bound HZSM-5 catalyst having a silica/alumina ratio of 26, a crystal size of 0.1 micron, an Alpha Value of 731. The feed to the reactor was toluene containing 1% silicone compound having a phenylmethyl silicone to dimethyl silicone ratio of 1:1. Operating conditions are 4.0 WHSV, 480\ufffd C., 3550 kPa (500 psig), and a hydrogen/hydrocarbon ratio of 2., 210354=[0276] A second sample of HZSM-5 was prepared according to the following procedure: 20.66 g of NaOH was dissolved in 560.3 g distilled water, followed by 10.6 g of sodium aluminate (Na2O\ufffdAl2O3\ufffd3H2O) and 98.13 g tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr). The mixture was stirred until a clear solution formed. 485.9 g Nalco 2327 silica sol (40 wt % SiO2) was then added and the mixture stirred for two hours. The pH of the resulting mixture was 12.5. The mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined Parr reactor and heated at 300\ufffd F. (150\ufffd C.) for seven days with stirring (275 rpm). The reaction mixture was cooled and filtered, and the solid product washed with 10 L of distilled water. The zeolite powder was calcined to remove the template using the following program: Dry at 329\ufffd F. (165\ufffd C.) for 4 hr.; ramp to 950\ufffd F. (510\ufffd C.) over 4 hr.; hold at 950\ufffd F. (510\ufffd C.) for 12 hr.; ramp back to ambient temperature over 4 hr. An SEM micrograph of the sieve powder is shown in FIG. 7., 189491=[0252] A slurry process can be used to obtain very pure para-xylene from impure crystalline para-xylene. Impure crystalline para-xylene having a purity of less than about 99.7 weight percent, for example, para-xylene having a purity of about 80 to less than about 99.7 weight percent, can be purified to crystalline para-xylene having a purity of at least about 99.7 weight percent, preferably at least about 99.8 weight percent, and most preferably at least about 99.85 weight percent para-xylene, by contacting the impure crystalline para-xylene in the form of a slurry with a liquid containing para-xylene at a temperature of at least 32\ufffd F., preferably about 35\ufffd F. to about 45\ufffd F., more preferably at a temperature of about 37\ufffd F. to about 44\ufffd F., and most preferably at a temperature of about 39\ufffd F. to about 42\ufffd F., for a time sufficient to increase the purity of the crystalline para-xylene to at least about 99.7 weight percent, more preferably at least about 99.8 weight percent, and most preferably at least about 99.85 weight percent para-xylene. It is necessary to use these temperatures for the slurry in order to obtain the desired very high purity para-xylene. When operated as a continuous process, the residence time of the slurry of crystalline para-xylene and liquid para-xylene in the vessel used for containing the slurry is suitably about 0.2 to about 2 hours, more preferably about 0.25 to about 0.5 hour. The amount of liquid in the slurry should be an amount to produce a mixture that can be slurried and pumped. For example, the slurry can be about 30 to about 60 weight percent solids with the remainder being the liquid portion of the slurry. More preferably, the slurry is about 40 to about 50 weight percent solids. This liquid used for the slurry is a liquid containing para-xylene. The amount of para-xylene in the liquid is an amount suitable for providing for the slurry of crystalline para-xylene and liquid at the temperature used for the slurry. Preferably, the liquid para-xylene used to prepare the slurry is about 70 to about 85 weight percent para-xylene. The remainder of the liquid is typically a mixture of ortho- and meta-xylene, ethylbenzene and minor amounts of other hydrocarbons present in the process. After the desired purity of crystalline para-xylene is achieved, the purified crystalline para-xylene is separated from the liquid and preferably washed with liquid para-xylene to remove adhering mother liquor. The liquid para-xylene used for the wash is preferably high purity para-xylene having a purity of at least about 99.7 weight percent, more preferably at least about 99.8 weight percent. The weight ratio of liquid para-xylene wash to crystalline para-xylene is typically about 0.05:1 to about 0.5:1, more preferably about 0.15:1 to about 0.25:1. Upon melting the purified crystalline para-xylene, a liquid product para-xylene having a purity of at least 99.7 weight percent, more preferably at least about 99.8 weight percent, and most preferably at least about 99.85 weight percent para-xylene is produced., 57370=[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/220,536 filed Jul. 10, 2000, U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/238,217 filed Oct. 5, 2000, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/289,313 filed May 8, 2001, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties., 135058=[0146] Suitable pressures may be selected in ranges of above about 30 psia (206 kPa), above about 50 psia (345 kPa), and above about 100 psia (2760 kPa) with pressures preferably above about 50 psia (345 kPa)., 214968=[0286] 4.7 g of NaOH was dissolved in 119 g of distilled water. 640 g of MeOH and 220 g of Nalco 2327 silica sol (nominally 40 wt % SiO2) were then added. The mixture was transferred to a 2 L autoclave and heated at 320\ufffd F. (160\ufffd C.) for 28 hours with stirring (\u02dc150 rpm). The product was collected by filtration and washed with 16 L of distilled water and calcined using the procedure described for sample (2). An SEM micrograph of the sieve powder is shown in FIG. 11., 136819=[0149] In the process of the present invention, the operating pressure is at least about 30 psia (206 kPa), preferably at least about 50 psia (345 kPa) and may range from about 50 psia (345 kPa) to about 400 psia (2760 kPa). The operating pressure will preferably range from about 30 psia to about 400 psia, more preferably from about 50 psia to about 400 psia, more preferably from about 100 psia to about 400 psia (from about 690 kPa to about 2760 kPa), more preferably from about 150 psia to about 350 psia (from about 1715 kPa to about 2410 kPa). For some embodiments, the pressure may range from about 200 psia to about 300 psia (from about 1380 kPa to about 2070 kPa)., 143080=[0159] The present invention is a pressure swing adsorption process for separation of pX and EB from mixtures of C8 aromatics using a non-acidic, para-selective adsorbent, such as silicalite molecular sieve, comprising orthorhombic crystals having an average minimum dimension of around 0.2 \u03bcm or greater. During adsorption, mX and oX are substantially not adsorbed, while pX and EB are substantially adsorbed. The process will preferably operate at about 500\ufffd F. to about 750\ufffd F. (about 260 to about 400\ufffd C.) with pX partial pressures of about 30 to about 150 psi (about 200 to about 1000 kPa), preferably about 40 to about 120 psi (about 265 to about 800 kPa). Selective adsorption of pX and EB (from a feed containing pX, EB, mX and oX) occurs with a silicalite adsorbent, comprising orthorhombic crystals having an average minimum dimension of around 0.2 \u03bcm or greater. At elevated temperatures [greater than about 350\ufffd F. (176\ufffd C.), adsorption of pX or pX/EB is effected at high partial pressures [greater than about 25 psia (about 170 kPa) partial pressure)]. Subsequently, rapid desorption without catalytic reaction is effected by lowering the partial pressure of the adsorbates. The partial pressure may be decreased by lowering the total pressure in the adsorption vessel or by purging the bed with an inert flow, for example, He, N2, H2, CH4, CO2 etc., while maintaining the unit pressure. The purge gas first displaces the C8 aromatic feed from the non-selective void volume which lowers the partial pressure of para-xylene and ethylbenzene in the adsorption vessel and then sweeps out the adsorbate (substantially para-xylene and ethylbenzene) as it desorbs from the molecular sieve pores., 100070=[0057] In the present invention the operating temperature is preferably from about 350\ufffd F. to about 750\ufffd F. and the operating pressure is preferably from about 30 psia to about 400 psia (from about 206 kPa to about 2760 kPa)., 216285=g adsorbed=[He flow (cc/min)\ufffdConc(torr/760 torr/atm)\ufffd1 atm\ufffdt(min)\ufffd106 g/mol]/22400 cc/mol\u2003\u2003(1)}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes [0315] With such low yield losses to TMB, Cases I and II represent an atypical operation of a xylene isomerization reactor that would be well suited for use in reactor R2 of Embodiment 4 of the toluene conversion-PSA process of the present invention. Because of the need to convert EB, Case III represents more conventional operation of a xylene isomerization reactor and would be more appropriate for use in reactor R3 of Embodiment 4. [0314] It can be seen in Cases I and II that at fairly mild conditions, as indicated by the low EB conversion, that the PATE is significant while the production of TMB is minor.
