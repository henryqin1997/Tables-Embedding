The NHANES 2005-2006 Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights for these age groups. The phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such as the conditions precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and phlebotomy files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN., 2276=Comparison of means and regression analysis revealed high overall agreement but a significant difference between the two methods (bias). The mean (SD) serum creatinine at CCRL, NHANES, and their difference were 1.010 (0.313), 1.049 (0.320), and -0.040 (0.047) mg/dL, respectively (paired t-test, p <0.0001). The Pearson\u2019s correlation was 0.989. The Deming regression of CCRL (Y) on NHANES (X) had an intercept of -0.016 (SE, 0.008) and a slope of 0.978 (SE, 0.007). Thus, a correction of the NHANES 2005-2006 serum creatinine values is highly recommended. The following formula should be used to adjust the NHANES serum creatinine values to ensure comparability with standard creatinine:, 4396=Correction of serum creatinine values in NHANES 2005-2006 is highly recommended: Serum creatinine was assayed from a random sample of 195 stored specimens from participants aged 60 years or older in NHANES 2005-2006 to determine if the original values obtained by the NHANES laboratory were comparable to values obtained from a method traceable to a \u201cgold standard\u201d (and referred to as \u201cstandard creatinine\u201d). The Cleveland Clinic Foundation Research Laboratory (CCRL) analyzed the serum creatinine specimens using a Roche coupled enzymatic assay (creatininase, creatinase, sarcosine oxidase, kits # 1775677 and 1775766) performed on a Roche P Module instrument. College of American Pathologists (CAP) Creatinine Accuracy Calibration Verification/Linearity Survey LN24 (LN24) samples were used as accuracy controls to verify that the calibration of the Roche enzymatic method was traceable to LC-IDMS and correctly implemented in the CCRL. The Roche method exhibits total imprecision ranging from 1.2% C.V. at 1.00 mg/dL (88.4 mol/L) to 1.6% at 3.84 mg/dL (339.5 mol/L). Serum creatinine by the Roche method was compared to the original NHANES 2005-2006 measurements which used a Jaffe rate method performed on a Beckman Synchron LX20. The design and methods for this calibration study were identical to those used for the NHANES III, 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004 surveys (Selvin et al., 2007)., 21878=The 18 analytes described in this method constitute the routine biochemistry profile. The analyses are performed with a Beckman Synchron LX20. Each analyte is described separately within each pertinent section of this document. NOTE: Glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were analyzed as part of this profile, but the results do not replace the formalized reference methods data from NHANES 2005-2006 samples analyzed at other institutions.}",
