Jamin, 2002, \"Dance with the Dollar: Exchange Rate Exposure of German Stock Returns,\" mimeo, February., 46391=The lower panel repeats this exercise using the results obtained when commodity prices are excluded from the regression. The solid blue line is the estimate of aggregate pass-through shown in the lower panel of Exhibit 2 (the benchmark model with commodity prices excluded). The dotted green line is a weighted average of the one-digit pass-through estimates from Exhibit 7. Finally, the dashed red line weights up the results of Exhibit 7 using average trade shares from 1972 to 1982. In this instance, the dashed red line falls on balance but has been noticeably above the solid blue line in the most recent ten-year samples. Given the relatively high pass-through estimates for industrial supplies shown in Exhibit 7, the decline in the share of these goods in U.S. core imports-from 33 percent during the 1970s to under 20 percent at present-appears to be one factor that has contributed to the decline in aggregate pass-through. Nevertheless, as the dashed red line has clearly moved down, this shift in the composition of core imports is only a partial explanation for the observed fall in aggregate pass-through., 423926=26.\u00a0\u00a0See, for example, Campa and Goldberg (2002 and 2004).\u00a0Return to text, 33726=The upper panel of Exhibit 1 reports estimated exchange-rate pass-through to import prices of U.S. core goods, as a ten-year backward-looking sample is rolled forward.17 For example, pass-through of roughly 0.65 in 1990 represents the estimate of in a regression over the period 1981 to 1990. It implies that a 10 percent increase in the dollar value of foreign prices would lead to a 6.5 percent increase in U.S. import prices of core goods. The gray shading indicates the 95 percent confidence interval around the estimated pass-through coefficient., 38479=As noted above, our rolling regressions are done with a ten-year estimation window. Exhibit 3 shows that the decline in pass-through can also be seen when other estimation windows are used. As displayed in the upper panel, when we take 15-year samples, the pass-through coefficient steadily declines from above 0.6 in the early 1990s to just below 0.3 in the most recent 15-year periods. With a five-year regression window, the pass-through coefficient moves above 0.8 in 1987 and 1988, then declines to about 0.4 in the mid-1990s, steps down further to about 0.2 in the late 1990s and early this decade, and finally ebbs to zero during the most recent five-year samples. We conclude that the decline in pass-through is not an artifact of our choice of estimation windows., 41024=It is possible that exchange rate changes have largely served to shift the geographical composition of U.S. imports away from high-wage countries toward low-wage countries. These low-wage countries-given their cost advantages-may have been able to continue to provide goods to the U.S. market at or near the price that prevailed before the exchange rate change. To the extent that this has been the case, exchange rate changes would have had muted effects on the price of U.S. imports but, instead, would have shifted the weights in the exchange rate and foreign price indexes toward low-wage countries. In an effort to assess this hypothesis, we have fixed the country weights in our exchange rate and foreign price variables first at their 1982 values and then at their 2003 values, thus attenuating this channel., 98982=Taylor, J., 2000, \"Low Inflation, Pass-through, and the Pricing Power of Firms,\" European Economic Review, 44, 1389-1408., 98584=Olivei, G., 2002, \"Exchange Rates and the Prices of Manufacturing Products Imported into the United States,\" New England Economic Review, First Quarter, 3-18., 45663=The dashed red line in the upper panel of Exhibit 8 is derived by weighting up the one-digit sectoral pass-through estimates from Exhibit 6 using average trade shares from 1972 to 1982. If the fall in aggregate pass-through largely reflected a shift in the composition of imports toward goods with prices that were less sensitive to the exchange rate, the dashed red line would remain relatively stable and above the solid black and dotted green lines. However, the dashed red line closely tracks the dotted green line-and both lines follow the solid black line.28, 52030=The lower panel of Exhibit 9 provides some empirical evidence linking China to the decline in pass-through. For the 1985-1994 and 1995-2004 periods, we estimated separate pass-through coefficients for 34 five-digit import categories and-where five-digit price data were not available-another 22 two- and three-digit categories. (It was not clear how to appropriately specify the commodity price variables for each of the disaggregated sectors, so these regressions did not include commodity prices.) Together, these 56 categories account for more than 80 percent of U.S. non-oil imports. We have found a statistically significant correlation between the rise in China's U.S. import shares over the past decade and the decline in pass-through across these product categories. In other words, pass-through has tended to post relatively steep declines in those categories in which China has expanded its market share most rapidly. For example, in categories where China's import share has risen more than 10 percentage points since 1994, the median decline in the pass-through coefficient was 0.341 versus a median decline of 0.157 in other categories. The difference in mean declines is even more striking-0.362 in those categories in which China's share grew at least 10 percentage points versus a mean change of zero in other categories. We replicated this exercise for Mexico, another emerging market economy that gained U.S. import share over the past decade, but did not find a significant relationship., 9648=Another explanation, which is not easily dismissed, focuses on China's increasing presence in the U.S. market. Given China's fixed exchange rate regime, Chinese exporters have been insulated from the fall in the dollar, and competition from Chinese firms may very well have constrained exporters from other countries from raising their prices in response to the dollar's decline. We find that across categories of U.S. imports, larger increases in China's market share over the past decade have been associated with more significant declines in pass-through. Moreover, the threat of potential competition from China may have been a more general factor constraining exporters from increasing their dollar prices in response to a rise in their currencies against the dollar.7 As a related point, we also find recurring evidence of a step down in pass-through around the time of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, suggesting that the pricing behavior of Asian firms was affected by the crisis and subsequent developments in the region., 96321=Diewert, E., W. Alterman, and L. Eden, 2004, \"Transfer Prices and Import and Export Price Indexes: Theory and Practice,\" mimeo, June., 75409=Exhibit 15 shows that foreign multilateral export prices in most cases do respond to movements in the NEER, but the degree of sensitivity varies across regions. Specifically, the estimated coefficients for the European Union as a whole, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Asian NIEs are all in the neighborhood of 0.3, while the coefficient for Japan is about 0.5.4344 These results suggest that a 10 percent nominal effective depreciation of the EU currencies, the Canadian dollar, or the Asian NIE currencies would raise the price of exports from these regions about 3 percent (in terms of their own currencies), whereas a similar decline in the nominal effective yen would boost the yen price of Japanese exports 5 percent. (Equivalently, in terms of the currencies of importing countries, European, Canadian, and Asian NIE export prices would decline 7 percent, and Japanese export prices would decline 5 percent.), 419999=16.\u00a0\u00a0The various specifications generally include two lags of the exchange rate and foreign prices. Similar to Campa and Goldberg (2002 and 2004), we find that pass-through tends to occur rapidly and in our regressions is fully captured by two lags. (The issue of lag structure is taken up in more detail in section 3.5.)\u00a0Return to text, 313=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers Number 833, April 2005 --- Screen Reader Version*, 96873=Gagnon, J. and J. Ihrig, 2004, \"Monetary Policy and Exchange rate Pass-through,\" International Journal of Finance and Economics, 9, 315-338., 73317=While profit margins on exports to the United States appear to be more narrow than was the case in early 2002, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the level of profit margins is \"too narrow\" at present-profits several years ago might have been unusually high. As just one case in point, the first three columns of Exhibit 14 compare movements in export prices and unit labor costs over the preceding period, 1995-2002. This exercise suggests that the profit margins of firms exporting to the United States posted a dramatic run-up between the dollar's trough in the spring of 1995 and the dollar's peak in early 2002. Indeed, despite the unwinding of U.S. profit margins that has occurred over the last couple of years, profit margins for Japanese exporters to the United States appear to have remained well above those that prevailed in the second quarter of 1995, while those for European Union, Canadian and Asian NIE exporters seem to be either up some or little changed on balance. It is also worth noting that the profit margins of exporters from all these economies appear to have moved up to varying degrees on a multilateral basis relative to the spring of 1995., 98089=Knetter, M., 1995, \"Pricing to Market in Response to Unobservable and Observable Shocks,\" International Economic Journal, 9, 1-25., 3785=Since early 2002, the dollar has fallen markedly, but the response of U.S. import prices to the dollar's move has been slow and apparently muted. This outcome has raised important questions regarding the magnitude and stability of exchange rate pass-through to import prices. The answers to such questions have implications for U.S. inflation, as import prices are a principal channel through which movements in the exchange rate affect domestic prices and hence also the variability of inflation and output. These considerations may ultimately have implications for the appropriate stance of monetary policy.1 In addition, the degree to which import prices adjust to the exchange rate will be a key factor determining the path of U.S. external adjustment. The extent of exchange rate pass-through will influence U.S. demand for real imports and thus contribute to the adjustment (or non-adjustment) of U.S. real net exports. The implications of pass-through for the current account balance, however, are less certain. For example, given a price elasticity of import demand near one, an increase in import prices lowers the quantity of imports but, because their price is higher, leaves total expenditures on imports about unchanged.2 By similar reasoning, if the price elasticity of import demand is greater than one, a decline in pass-through would tend to inhibit nominal adjustment.3, 97298=Glaum, M., M. Brunner, and H. Himmel, 2000, \"The DAX and the Dollar: The Economic Exchange Rate Exposure of German Corporations,\" Journal of International Business Studies, 31, 715-724., 425654=31.\u00a0\u00a0Bilateral import price data begin for Latin America in December 1997 and for a number of other countries (including China) in December 2003.\u00a0Return to text, 58432=With over one-third of U.S. merchandise trade consisting of transactions within firms, an important issue is the extent to which transfer prices may be part of the explanation for the observed decline in pass-through. What is certain is that the way transfer prices are utilized in the construction of import price data changed in 1998. Before that time, only transfer prices that were deemed to be sufficiently \"market based\" were included in the indexes. Since 1998, all transfer prices have been included., 35859=To further gauge the robustness of the decline in pass-through, the thin blue line in the lower panel of Exhibit 2 depicts rolling pass-through estimates that are obtained when primary commodity prices (PCOM) are excluded from the regression. The pass-through coefficient now incorporates the indirect effects of exchange rate moves working through commodity prices. The downward trend in pass-through since the early 1980s remains. That said, relative to the estimates in Exhibit 1, the pass-through coefficient starts higher-at 0.8 or above for ten-year samples ending in 1983-85-and then falls in the most recent ten-year period to a little over 0.3, still somewhat above the estimate in Exhibit 1. Notably, the pass-through coefficient steps down markedly as 1997 and 1998, the years coincident with the Asian financial crisis, roll into the sample window. Other evidence presented in this paper is consistent with the view that the Asian crisis had important effects on pass-through to U.S. import prices. In contrast to our benchmark results (Exhibit 1), the pass-through coefficients obtained when commodity prices are excluded from the regression have moved down only slightly in the ten-year samples ending over the past four or five years. The fact that pass-through estimated without controlling for commodity prices has been somewhat more stable of late is another recurrent feature of our empirical work and suggests that an increasing share of the exchange rate's effect on import prices has recently occurred through a commodity price channel.20, 55423=As displayed in the upper panel, when the specification includes the contemporaneous change in the exchange rate and two quarterly lags, we obtain a sustained secular decline in all three coefficients. The contemporaneous coefficient falls from above 0.3 to around 0.1; the first lag falls from above 0.2 to just above zero; and the second lag, although volatile initially, falls from just under 0.2 to near zero (for ten-year samples ending in 1998 and thereafter)., 70958=Canadian dollar until early 2003, and Canadian export prices and the BLS measure have both fallen on balance since that time. For the Asian NIEs, multilateral export prices have climbed over the past year, but the BLS measure of prices charged in the U.S. market has continued to drift down. In general, the BLS data have shown marked declines over the past couple of years, while multilateral export prices for these economies have fallen less or posted modest increases., 91470=Yang (1997) and Bodnar et al. (2002) derive an explicit expression for optimal pass-through, and they find this expression to be less than one under their maintained assumptions. Specifically, in the face of an appreciation of the exporter's currency, complete pass-through-a one-for-one increase in the price (expressed in terms of the importing country's currency)-would maintain the profit margin (profits per unit stated in the exporter's currency) but would decrease total profits due to a decline in export sales. Thus, by decreasing its margin to maintain sales, the firm maximizes profits. Using data from 1986 to 1995, Bodnar et al. estimate the implications of their model for eight Japanese export industries. They find optimal pass-through values ranging from 0.15 for film to 0.81 for construction machinery., 70478=As shown in Exhibits 12-13, the foreign export price data (the dotted red lines) and the BLS data (the dashed blue lines) at times move in different directions, but some common trends are apparent nevertheless. In particular, since the dollar's peak in early 2002, both measures have posted declines for the EU and Japan, although the prices charged in the United States have fallen more in both cases. For Canada, the U.S. dollar did not decline in earnest against the, 98267=Mann, C., 1986, \"Prices, Profits Margins, and Exchange Rates,\" Federal Reserve Bulletin, 72, 366-379., 95456=Bussiere, M., 2004, \"Non-linear Exchange Rate Pass-through?\" mimeo, December., 82398=The results for Germany, which are reported in the top panel of Exhibit 18, suggest that the exchange rate sensitivity of German export prices has been low and stable over time. The Japanese response to the exchange rate, although markedly higher than for Germany, has moved up only slightly on balance over the last twenty years. For the United Kingdom, the effect of the exchange rate on export prices manifests an upward trend through much of the sample period, but this is rapidly reversed in 2002. It is reasonable to conjecture that the sharp decline in the exchange rate sensitivity of UK export prices in 2002 reflects that the fact that the 1992 ERM crisis had rolled out of the regression window. In the most recent ten-year samples, however, the responsiveness of UK import prices to the NEER has again begun to move up., 50984=This discussion suggests that if China's increased presence in the U.S. market is to be a key explanation for the decline in pass-through, the main influences must have come through China's effects on the competitive conditions within U.S. markets. At present, China's import share exceeds 50 percent in six five-digit (end-use) categories and 25 percent in another fifteen categories. Together, these twenty-one categories represent 22 percent of total U.S. merchandise imports. Certainly in these categories, competitors from other countries have had good reason to be hesitant to pass through cost shocks from the recent appreciation of their currencies, given that China's peg to the dollar insulates its exporters from such shocks. An open issue is why exporters from other countries did not cut their dollar prices more aggressively as the dollar strengthened from 1995 to 2002. Instead, as will be shown below, these exporters apparently chose to pad their profit margins (in terms of their local currencies) during that period., 97531=Goldberg, P. and M. Knetter, 1997, \"Goods Prices and Exchange Rates: What Have We Learned?\" Journal of Economic Literature, 35, 1243-1272., 71441=Exhibits 12-13 also display measures of economy-wide unit labor costs. To the extent that such measures reflect the costs borne by foreign exporters, movements in profit margins may be proxied by changes in export prices relative to changes in unit labor costs.40 As shown in Exhibit 14, given this proxy for profit margins, the BLS data suggest that foreign margins in the U.S. market have generally recorded sizable declines since the dollar's peak in early 2002. However, similar calculations using multilateral export prices indicate that exporting firms in Japan, Canada, and East Asia have eked out small gains in their margins over the same period, with a moderation in unit labor costs helping to offset soft or declining multilateral export prices. The European Union is the one region for which multilateral profit margins appear to have declined., 34444=The pass-through coefficient obtained in the most recent ten-year period is estimated to be 0.12. The lower standard error band crosses zero in early 2003, indicating that the pass-through estimates for the latest ten-year samples have not been statistically different from zero. The lower panel shows that since 1990, the effect of primary commodity prices on import prices has climbed steadily and has remained statistically significant. Notably, this simple model is able to explain much of the variance in import prices, with the R for these rolling regressions hovering around 0.8., 98790=Pollard, P. and C. Coughlin, 2004, \"Size Matters: Asymmetric Exchange Rate Pass-through at the Industry Level,\" Leverhulme Centre Research Paper 2004/13., 50012=Over the past decade, China's share of U.S. merchandise imports has risen 7.6 percentage points, from 5.8 percent in 1994 to 13.4 percent in 2004. China has posted large gains in steel and other finished metal products; high-tech, telecom, and business machines; and consumer durables. If U.S. imports from China showed zero pass-through, and imports from countries losing import share showed complete pass-through, the direct arithmetic effect of China's increased presence in the U.S. market would lower the aggregate pass-through coefficient just 0.076, only a fraction of the observed decline. And this calculation almost certainly overstates the direct arithmetic effect. In those product categories in which China has gained the most ground, import shares for Japan and the emerging Asian economies have typically experienced the largest losses. As was shown in the previous section, pass-through from these economies is much closer to zero than to unity., 99151=Yang, J., 1997, \"Exchange Rate Pass-Through in U.S. Manufacturing Industries,\" Review of Economics and Statistics, 89, 95-104., 95151=Allayannis, G. and J.

In other words, the low level of pass-through in the U.S. market does seem to be taking a toll on profit margins. This result comes with an important caveat, however. It remains an open issue as to whether profits margins on exports to the United States are now \"too narrow\" or if margins were unusually high several years ago., 96652=Gagnon, J., 2004, \"The Effect of Exchange Rates on Prices, Wages, and Profits: A Case Study of the United Kingdom in the 1990s,\" International Economic Journal, forthcoming., 58961=By law, transfer prices are required to meet an arm's-length standard, i.e., they should be the prices that would have prevailed if the transaction had occurred between two unrelated parties. Relatively rigorous enforcement of transfer pricing laws by customs and tax authorities appears to be improving the quality of transfer prices. However, there continues to be a range of views as to how well these inherently counter-factual prices reflect underlying economic reality.34 As an empirical matter, we note that the decline in pass-through is evident in the data both before 1998 and afterwards. As such, we see no clear link between the decline in pass-through and the shift in the way that transfer pries are used in constructing the trade data., 97061=Gagnon, J. and M.

Campa and Goldberg (2004) find that pass-through to import prices declined in the 1990-2003 period relative to the 1975-1989 period for fifteen of the twenty-one countries that they study; however, these declines are not statistically significant in many cases.}",
