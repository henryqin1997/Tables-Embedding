For the first time, a majority of respondents in the Northeast characterized supply in their local housing market as \"in balance.\" Consistent with the paring down of excess supply, the survey results also indicate improvement in residential construction activity. The proportion reporting new home construction at average or above-average levels rose to 85 percent. Reports of new home construction increasing at above-average levels were more frequent in July than in April in every region, with the biggest gains reported in the Northeast and the South., 25793=Percent of respondents in July reporting existing home sales were..., 27695=Assessments of commercial property transactions continued to be increasingly positive. Nationally, 83 percent of the observers cited commercial sales activity at average or above-average levels, up from 73 percent in April. Furthermore, fewer respondents (16 percent) rated commercial sales as sub-par than in any previous survey. Although weak sales continued to be cited most frequently on both coasts, above-average commercial sales were much higher than a year ago in the Northeast (16 percent from four percent) and the West (20 percent from 12 percent)., 29024=Regional Trends In general, July assessments of trends in real estate markets were most positive in the West. Paced by more widespread reports of gains in housing markets, the composite index for the region rose to 78, the highest reading yet. A year ago, the index registered 53. In part, the region's strong July reading reflects a rebound in key markets in California from recent problems., 23202=Survey respondents in July continued to be confident about residential markets. Forty-five percent observed better conditions in their local housing markets, the same proportion reported previously; however, those noting worsening conditions in July fell to 8 percent. The national summary index for residential markets inched up to 69 from 68 in April. The July results received a substantial boost from gains in the West where 66 percent reported better housing markets -- up from 54 percent in April., 22830=Real estate market changes over the three months ending in July 1996, 31583=The survey consisted of 316 interviews of examiners and asset managers experienced in evaluating real estate loan portfolios or marketing real estate assets. The respondents at the FDIC represent the most senior experts from the Division of Supervision and from the Division of Depositor and Asset Services. Senior real estate examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve System, and the Office of Thrift Supervision also participated. It should be noted that the number of respondents in the survey is down considerably from the 500-plus when the survey was initiated in 1991. This decline reflects the fact that the survey included a large number of asset managers at the RTC, which sunset at year-end 1995., 22656=Overview: Summary Indices The national composite index, summarizing assessments of real estate markets, edged up to 68 in July from 67 in April., 29453=Evaluations of real estate market trends in both the Midwest and the South remained positive. Although observers in both regions reported some weakening in residential markets, the regional composite indices remained at high levels in July (Midwest, 65, and South, 70). Overall gains in residential markets were particularly prevalent in the \"East South Central\" states (Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi) and in the Pacific coast states., 21829=The FDIC's Survey of Real Estate Trends detected continued improvements in both commercial and residential real estate markets during the prior three months. In fact, the latest results were the most upbeat in over a year. The survey reflected positive trends in market activity in many areas of the nation, with reports of gains up notably in the Northeast and the West. However, the proportion of respondents seeing better market conditions in the South and the Midwest remained the same or declined following reports in April of significant increases, especially in the residential sector. The quarterly survey, conducted in late July, asks field personnel from all federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies about developments during the prior three months in their local real estate markets., 30831=Residential markets in the Northeast also rebounded during the May-July period from a relatively sluggish late 1995 and early 1996. The highest proportion of respondents to date, 28 percent, reported above-average home sales. Furthermore, 36 percent observed increasing sale prices, up from 25 percent three months ago. In addition, stronger assessments of both new home and apartment construction were recorded in the Northeast region.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Improving market: Index Value > 50 Declining market: Index Value > 50 Notes to Users: The indices presented above were compiled for both residential and commercial real estate markets for the four major U.S. Census Bureau regions. Each regional index is a summary measure of the respondents' opinions about changes in market conditions in the past three months. The number of respondents by region was: Northeast (60), South (106), Midwest (90) and West (60). The national totals include a small number of responses that could not be classified by region. In constructing the index, a value of 100 was assigned to responses indicating the conditions were \"better,\" and a value of 0 was given to responses saying conditions were \"worse.\" A \"no change\" answer was assigned a value of 50. Commercial and residential indices at the regional level are the sum of these values divided by the number of respondents in that region for that type of property. Composite indices at the regional level are the weighted average of the residential and commercial indices for each region. The weights for each region are calculated using the value of construction permits for residential and commercial markets from 1982-1991. National indices are weighted averages of the comparable market measure of each region. The data for both the residential and commercial market weights are from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. An",
