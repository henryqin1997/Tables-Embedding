It should also work with other versions. * a PHP interpreter <http://www.php.net> FiForms requires PHP 5.x. * Php.XPath (this is included with FiForms if you are installing using a pre-built package or installer) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpxpath/> * XSLTProc (required if you will be using FiReportsXML with server-side transformation, and you are not using PHP_XSLT) <http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/> Install libxslt on your operating system and configure the path to XSLTProc in FiForms_global.inc.php Note to windows users: A package containing all the programs you need is available at http://downloads.sourceforge.net/myforms/FiForms_Binary_Dependencies_Win.zip This",
