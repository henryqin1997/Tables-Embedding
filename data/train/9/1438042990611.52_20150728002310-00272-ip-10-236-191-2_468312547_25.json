For example, a microstrip antenna may be in the formed onto the surface of a plastic case or on the printed circuit board. Surface mount device (SMD) or \" chip\" antennas are mounted Integrated Low Noise Multi-Chip Amplifier Modules To amplify weak signals received by the antenna in communication systems, low noise amplifiers (LNAs) are deployed. LNAs are used in various applications, for example in, GPS receivers, wireless data systems, satellite communication, cellular handsets, radio systems, etc. The low noise Combi Chips Combi chips are plastic smart cards with a central processing unit (CPU), chip operating system (COS), security module and memory embedded in the surface as an IC chip. They incorporate both contact and contactless functions.
