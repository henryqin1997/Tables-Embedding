    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{139365=Although sulfur-cured rubber having a cobalt adhesion promoter adheres well to uncoated 63/37 brass, the unhydrolyzed A1170/A1289 mixture provided excellent adhesion to all three rubber formulations (with or without the cobalt adhesion promoter). Thus, the silane mixtures of the present invention allows for the elimination of the cobalt adhesion promoter, while also providing improved corrosion protection., 60467=Thus, one or more bis-silyl aminosilanes may be hydrolyzed by mixing the silane(s) with water at the desired concentration. A compatible solvent (such as an alcohol) may be added as desired, however hydrolysis of the bis-silyl aminosilane will generally proceed to completion without an added solvent (and the resulting hydrolyzed silane solution will remain stable). One or more bis-silyl polysulfur silanes may be hydrolyzed in a similar fashion, however a compatible solvent should be included since these silanes are generally not water-soluble. Thus, hydrolysis of the bis-silyl polysulfur silane(s) may take place in a solution having a water to solvent ratio (by volume) of between about 1:99 and about 99:1, more preferably between about 1:1 and about 1:20., 69280=As reported in application Ser. No. 09/356,927, now abandoned, titled Silane Treatment for Electrocoated Metals, which names Wim J. van Ooij and Guru P. Sundararajan as inventors, was filed on even date herewith, and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by way of reference, the hydrolyzed silane solutions of the present invention having both a bis-silyl aminosilane and a bis-silyl polysulfur silane also provide excellent adhesion to paints (particularly electrocoats) and other polymeric adhesives. As also reported therein, and as incorporated herein by way of reference, the hydrolyzed silane solutions of the present application also provide improved corrosion protection, as well as adhesion to other non-rubber polymers (such as paints and adhesives)., 134904=In the next set of examples, unhydrolyzed silane compositions were employed. Unless otherwise noted, all of the silane coatings were applied from pure silanes (either pure A1170, or a mixture consisting only of A1170 and A1289 in the indicated ratio). After the silanes were mixed with one another, the resultant silane mixture was wiped onto the metal (which had been cleaned in the manner described previously) using a paper towel. Unless otherwise noted, the silane coating applied in this manner was then dried for one hour at 150\ufffd C. Thereafter, the rubber composition was bonded to the silane coated metal in the manner described previously., 64963=As for the concentration of hydrolyzed silanes in the final, mixed silane solution (i.e., the solution applied to the metal substrate) beneficial results will be obtained over a wide range of silane concentrations and ratios. It is preferred, however, that the hydrolyzed solution have at least about 0.1% silanes by volume, wherein this concentration refers to the total concentration of bis-silyl aminosilane(s) and bis-silyl polysulfur silane(s) in the solution. More preferably, the solution has between about 0.1% and about 10% silanes by volume. As for the ratio of bis-silyl aminosilane(s) to bis-silyl polysulfur silane(s) in the hydrolyzed silane solution, a wide range of silane ratios provide beneficial results. Preferably, however the ratio of bis-silyl aminosilane(s) to bis-silyl polysulfur silane(s) is between about 1:99 and about 99:1. More preferably, particularly when the hydrolyzed silane solution is to be used for rubber bonding, this ratio is between about 1:10 and about 10:1. Even more preferably, this ratio is between about 1:3 and about 3:1., 90649=As for the ratio of unhydrolyzed aminosilane(s) having at least one secondary or tertiary amino group (such as unhydrolyzed bis-silyl aminosilane(s)) to other unhydrolyzed silane(s) (such as unhydrolyzed bis-silyl polysulfur silane(s)), a wide range of silane ratios provide beneficial results. Preferably, however the ratio of aminosilane(s) to other silanes is between about 1:10 and about 10:1. More preferably, particularly when the unhydrolyzed silane mixture is to be used for rubber bonding, this ratio is between about 1:3 and about 1:1., 59411=The hydrolyzed silane solutions of the present invention preferably comprise one or more bis-silyl aminosilanes and one or more bis-silyl polysulfur silanes. These hydrolyzed silane solutions also preferably include water (for hydrolysis), and one or more compatible solvents (such as ethanol, methanol, propanol or isopropanol) in order to solubilize the polysulfur silane. The amount of solvent employed will depend upon the concentration of polysulfur silane(s) in the solution, and the solution should therefore include sufficient solvent to solubilize the polysulfur silane(s). The ratio of water to solvent in the silane solution (as applied to the metal substrate, by volume) may be between about 1:99 and about 99:1, more preferably between about 1:1 and about 1:20., 202109=As shown in the above table, the mixture of hydrolyzed A1170 and A1289 provided excellent corrosion protection (superior to hydrolyzed A1170 alone, and at least equivalent to hydrolyzed A1289 alone). The unhydrolyzed silanes (including pure A1170, as well as the A1170/A1289 mixture) also provided excellent corrosion prevention. Thus, the silane solutions and methods of the present invention not only provide superior polymer adhesion, but also provide corrosion protection (with or without a polymer layer over the silane coating)., 125498=As indicated by the above results, mixtures of hydrolyzed A1170 and A1289 provided adhesion which was surprisingly superior to that provided by either silane alone. In fact, a hydrolyzed solution of A1170 provided no adhesion at all, yet even a small addition of A1170 to a hydrolyzed solution of A1289 improves adhesion. Other hydrolyzed silane solutions provided no adhesion to the sulfur-cured rubber, including the two-step BTSE/VS treatment which has previously been shown to provide excellent adhesion to peroxide-cured rubbers. The above results also indicate that the hydrolyzed silane mixtures of the present invention allow for the elimination of cobalt adhesion promoters, since the silane mixtures of the present invention provide better adhesion when the cobalt adhesion promoter is not used., 151202=Once again the large discrepancies in the adhesion values noted in the above table are due, in part, to the nature of the test employed. Therefore, the mode of failure is considered by the Applicants to be more significant. The above results demonstrate that unhydrolyzed mixtures of A1170 and A1289 provide even greater rubber adhesion than the hydrolyzed silane solutions of the present invention. This is surprising since conventional wisdom teaches that silanes should be applied to metals in a hydrolyzed state, rather than substantially unhydrolyzed. In addition, applicants have found that while unhydrolyzed A1289 alone will not form a dry film, when combined with unhydrolyzed A1170 it provides a superior, crosslinked silane coating. This highly crosslinked silane coating not only provides improved adhesion to rubbers and other polymers (such as paint), it also provides excellent corrosion protection (even without a polymer layer on top of the silane coating)., 130269=As noted from the above table, the addition of hydrolyzed A1170 to hydrolyzed A1289 solution does not significantly affect adhesion performance, even though hydrolyzed A1170 by itself provides no adhesion. However, the addition of A1170 during the period of time will provide greater corrosion protection, particularly during metal shipment or storage between application of the silane coating and rubber bonding., 82441=wherein x is an integer of from 2 to 10. One particularly preferred compound is bis-(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide (also referred to as bis-(triethoxysilylpropyl) sulfane, or \u201cTESPT\u201d). Commercially-available forms of TESPT (such as A-1289, available from Witco), however, are actually mixtures of bis-(triethoxysilylpropyl) sulfides having 2 to 10 sulfur atoms. In other words, these commercially-available forms of TESPT have a distribution of sulfide chain lengths, with the S3 and S4 sulfides predominating. Thus, the scope of the present invention includes hydrolyzed silane solutions containing mixtures of bis-silyl polysulfur silanes in combination with one or more bis-silyl aminosilanes., 100677=The following table provides adhesion results using hydrolyzed silane solutions on cold rolled steel (\u201cCRS\u201d). For each of the silane solutions, the indicated concentration (by volume) of the silane was mixed with alcohol (methanol or ethanol) and an amount of water equivalent to the silane concentration. For example, a 5% A1170 solution was prepared by mixing 5% A1170, 5% water and 90% ethanol (by volume). The pH was adjusted to the indicated amount by adding acetic acid as needed. The silane solution was stirred for at least 24 hours in order to complete hydrolysis. For mixtures of A1170 and A1289, the silanes were separately hydrolyzed in the same manner (5% silane, 5% water and 90% alcohol). After at least 24 hours of hydrolysis, the two silane solutions were mixed together to provide the indicated ratio of A1170:A1289, with the total silane concentration in the mixed silane solutions being 5% in all cases., 181425=Various other metals were adhered to rubber in the same manner as Example 9, using a mixture of unhydrolyzed A1170 and unhydrolyzed A1289 (1:3 ratio). Rubber adhesion was evaluated according to ISO 813, and the adhesion results are reported below (in N/mm).}",
