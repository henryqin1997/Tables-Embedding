    "textAfterTable": "PlsqlConnectionValidation Specifies the mechanism the mod_plsql module should use to detect terminated connections in its connection pool. Note: This configuration property is rarely ever changed, and system defaults suffice in almost all cases. For performance reasons, the mod_plsql module pools database connections. If a database instance goes down, and the mod_plsql module was maintaining a pool of connections to the instance, then each pooled database connection results in an error when it is next used to service a request. This can be a concern in high availability configurations such as RAC where even if one node goes down, other nodes servicing the database might have been able to service the request successfully. The mod_plsql module provides for a mechanism whereby it can self-correct after it detects a failure that could be caused by a database node going down. This mechanism to self-correct is controlled by the parameter PlsqlConnectionValidation. The following are the valid values for PlsqlConnectionValidation: Automatic: The mod_plsql module tests all pooled database connections which were created prior to the detection of a failure that could mean an instance failure. ThrowAwayOnFailure: The mod_plsql module throws away all pooled database connections which were created prior to the detection of",
