Minimum Required Accounting Attribute Assignments An example of accounting attributes of this type is Accounting Reversal Indicator. You may have values that control the behavior of the Create Accounting process when processing a specific accounting event or transaction object line. Values that Control the Behavior of the Create Accounting Process Examples of accounting attributes are Entered Currency Code and Entered Amount. You may have values that are subject to special processing or values that are stored in named columns in journal entry headers and lines. Values that are Subject to Special Processing The types of accounting attributes values are as follows: Line: To be used when creating subledger journal entry lines.

The Create Accounting process uses them to identify transaction (distributions) whose accounting impact should be reversed. For the Create Accounting process to successfully create a line accounting reversal, the accounting reversal indicator, distribution type, and first distribution identifier should always be assigned to sources.
