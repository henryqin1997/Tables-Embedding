    "textAfterTable": "Equity Risk: Equity securities (stocks) are more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments, including investments in high-grade fixed-income securities. The net asset value per share of this Fund will fluctuate as the value of the securities in the portfolio changes. Concentration Risk: Investing a high percentage of net assets in securities in a specific industry, the Fund may be subject to greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified. Currency Risk: Foreign currencies will fluctuate in value relative to the U.S. dollar; therefore you may lose money if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the U.S. dollar. Emerging and Frontier Markets Risk: Emerging and frontier market investing may be subject to additional economic, political, liquidity and currency risks not associated with more developed countries. Additionally, frontier countries generally have smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets and, as a result, the risks of investing in emerging market countries are magnified in frontier countries. Foreign (Non-U.S.) Securities Risk: Investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to less liquid markets, foreign government intervention and adverse economic, political, diplomatic, financial and regulatory factors.",
