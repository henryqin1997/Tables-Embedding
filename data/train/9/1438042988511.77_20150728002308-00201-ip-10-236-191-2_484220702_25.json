The disclosures of amphoteric surfactants in the above-identified references are incorporated herein by reference., 39038=A method for treating membranes is provided according to the invention. The method includes steps of: rinsing a membrane with a first liquid rinse composition; treating the membrane with a first multiple phase treatment composition comprising a gaseous phase and a liquid phase at a volumetric ratio of the gaseous phase to the liquid phase of at least about 5:1; flooding the membrane with water to provide a first liquid treatment composition and recirculating the first liquid treatment composition within the membrane; removing the first liquid treatment composition from the membrane; and treating the membrane with a second multiple phase treatment composition comprising a gaseous phase and a liquid phase at a volumetric ratio of the gaseous phase to the liquid phase of at least about 5:1., 158632=Several enzymes may fit into more than one class. A valuable reference on enzymes is \u201cIndustrial Enzymes\u201d, Scott, D., in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd Edition, (editors Grayson, M. and EcKroth, D.) Vol. 9, pp. 173-224, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1980. The disclosure of this reference relating to enzymes is incorporated herein by reference., 37388=Other exemplary techniques for cleaning filtration membranes are disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,740,308 to Fremont et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,387,189 to Gr\ufffdschl et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,356 to Olsen; and Munir Cheryan, Ultrafiltration and Microfiltration Handbook, Technical Publication, Lancaster, Pa., 1998 (Pages 237-239)., 33745=Filtration membranes have a tendency to foul during processing. Fouling manifests itself as a decline in flux with time of operation. Flux decline should occur when all operating parameters, such as pressure, flow rate, temperature, and feed concentration are kept constant. In general, membrane fouling is a complicated process and is believed due to a number of factors including electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, the deposition and accumulation of feed components, e.g., suspended particulates, impermeable dissolved solutes, and even normally permeable solutes, on the membrane surface and/or within the pores of the membrane. It is expected that almost all feed components will foul membranes to a certain extent. See Munir Cheryan, Ultrafiltration and Microfiltration Handbook, Technical Publication, Lancaster, Pa., 1998 (Pages 237-288). Fouling components and deposits can include inorganic salts, particulates, microbials and organics., 174015=The multiple phase cleaning solution can be provided having a ratio of the gaseous phase to the liquid phase that is sufficient to deliver a desired concentration of the liquid phase to the membrane surface to provide the desired treatment and/or detersive properties. In general, it is expected that the volumetric ratio of the gaseous phase to the liquid phase will be at least about 5:1. The volumetric ratio of the gaseous phase to the liquid phase can be provided at between about 5:1 and about 75,000:1. The air volume can be about 10 SCFM to about 1,000 SCFM depending on facility characteristics such as vessel size, number of membranes, number of separation stages, etc., 86882=A typical polysulfone UF membrane can tolerate about 5000 ppm days of chlorine. Therefore, to obtain a useful life from the membrane and minimize premature chemical degradation, industries standards recommend using no more than abou 211 ppm sodium hypochlorite or 200 ppm as avilable chlorine and a pH of about 11.5 for daily single phase CIP cleaning regimes. Also, in the case of 4 inch diameter UF and RO membranes maximum presssure differentials can be about 15-20 psi drop per module. According to the example in Table 2, this particular UF membrane system provides about 1062 gallons during membrane treatment steps. An exemplary non-buffered alkaline cleaning composition that meets this criterion requires 4.4 pounds of NaOH (sodium hydroxide), 1.9 pounds of NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite), 1.8 pounds of water conditioner and 0.9 pounds of surfactant. At these dosage levels, a resulting use concentration for the individual components meets the criteria and limitations of single phase CIP cleaning of a polysulfone UF membrane system as follows:, 132098=Further examples of suitable anionic surfactants are given in \u201cSurface Active Agents and Detergents\u201d (Vol. I and II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch). A variety of such surfactants are also generally disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678, issued Dec. 30, 1975 to Laughlin, et al. at column 23, line 58 through column 29, line 23. The disclosures of the above references relating to anionic surfactants are incorporated herein by reference., 41031=A multiple phase treatment composition is provided according to the invention. The multiple phase treatment composition includes a gaseous phase and a liquid phase where the gaseous phase and the liquid phase are provided at a volumetric ratio of between about 5:1 and about 75,000:1 and provided at a liquid phase flow rate of about 0.1 gal/min. to about 15 gal/min., and where the gaseous phase comprises air and the liquid phase comprises an active concentration of at least about 1 wt. %. The active concentration refers to the non-aqueous portion of the liquid phase., 246762=An ultrafiltration membrane was place in the pilot plant membrane skid as previously described. For the multiple phase flow, a minimum amount of air was used with various liquid injection rates of heated water. The purpose was to determine if there was adequate coverage of the membrane determined by measuring the temperature at the top and bottom of the vessel. At an air flow inlet pressure of 9.5 psig, 76 scfm, velocity of 8-14 fps and a liquid injection rate of 2.0 gpm, the resulting air to liquid ratio was about 172:1 to 283:1. Injection of heated water of about 115 deg F. resulted in a top vessel temperature of 109 deg F. and a bottom vessel temperature of 115 deg F. This demonstrates that at these multiple phase conditions adequate coverage of a given membrane treatment solution occurs. Furthermore this demonstrates, that relatively high flow velocity may not be required if concentrated chemistries are used to treat membranes chemically as opposed to treating with high velocity mechanical forces., 129501=A listing of the classes and species of surfactants useful herein appears in U.S. Pat. No. 3,664,961 issued May 23, 1972, to Norris, the disclosure being incorporated herein by reference as exemplary surfactants that can be used., 137079=The treatise Nonionic Surfactants, edited by Schick, M. J., Vol. 1 of the Surfactant Science Series, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1983 is an excellent reference on the wide variety of nonionic compounds that may be available in the practice of the present invention. A typical listing of nonionic classes, and species of these surfactants, is given in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678 issued to Laughlin and Heuring on Dec. 30, 1975. Further examples are given in \u201cSurface Active Agents and Detergents\u201d (Vol. I and II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch). The disclosures of these references relating to nonionic surfactants are incorporated herein by reference., 126538=One skilled in the art would understand that the gas to liquid volume ratio can be controlled to provide adequate delivery of the treatment composition. For example, in the case of a 4 inch diameter membrane vessel that is housing four 38 inch ultrafiltration membranes, a desired gaseous volume determined at the inlet can range from about 10 to about 1,000 SCFM (standard cubic foot per minute) with a theoretical velocity of about 1 ft/sec. to about 200 ft/sec. based upon the gaseous volume and cross sectional area of the pipe vessel and membrane cross sectional area. The liquid injection rate for the multiple phase flow can range from about 0.1 gal/min. to about 15 gal/min. Using these gas and liquid rates, an effective gas to liquid volume ratio for multiple phase flow could be in the range of gas:liquid at about 5:1 to about 75,000:1., 94353=To describe the chemistry concentration factor available using this technology, it was determined from pilot plant testing that for multiple phase flow, one can use 20% of the total membrane treatment solution as compared to conventional flooded single phase CIP flow. For conventional flow the total solution volume required is 21.2 gallons while using multiple phase flow, it was determined that 4 gallons of solution could be adequately circulated. Extrapolating these figures to the above industrial UF plant allows for a total volume of 212 gallons for multiple phase flow as compared to 1062 gallons for conventional single phase flow. Using 20% of the total solution allows for a minimum of five times the concentration of chemistry at equal cost. This value was determined on a pilot system that contained four UF membranes measuring 3.8 inch by 38 inch membranes. The modules were in series and housed in a 4 inch diameter membrane vessel. The multiple phase flow conditions included an air flow of 14 psig and 20 scfm (standard cubic feet per minute) and a liquid flow rate of 1.8 gpm. These conditions resulted in an air to liquid ratio of about 42:1 to 81:1 and a calculated velocity of about 2.6-5.0 feet per second. Using these conditions and concentration factors, a concentrated composition can be constructed that is economically feasible and while remaining within the chemical limitations of the membrane. In this case, an alkaline composition contains a buffering system, proteolytic enzymes, water conditioners and a surfactants resulting in a pH of about 9.0 to 10.0. It is therefore disclosed that an acidic, alkaline or neutral buffered systems containing water conditioners, surfactants, solvents and/or enzymes and combinations thereof can be used for effective membrane treatments depending upon the intended effect such as fat, protein and/or mineral reaction and removal., 19354=The use of a two-phase liquid/gas stream to clean pipelines is disclosed in European Patent Application 0 490 117 A1 to Kuebler that was published on Jun. 17, 1992 as an alternative to conventional clean-in-place techniques in order to reduce the amount of chemicals used. Kuebler describes cleaning pipelines using a two-phase liquid/gas stream and a reduction in throughput of the cleaning liquid by several orders of magnitude relative to conventional clean-in-place techniques. According to Kuebler:, 36356=In general, the frequency of cleaning and type of chemical treatment performed on the membrane has been found to affect the operating life of a membrane. It is believed that the operating life of a membrane can be decreased as a result of chemical degradation of the membrane over time. Various membranes are provided having temperature, pH, and chemical restrictions to minimize degradation of the membrane material. For example, many polyamide reverse osmosis membranes have chlorine restrictions because chlorine can have a tendency to damage the membrane. Cleaning and sanitizing filtration membranes is desirable in order to comply with laws and regulations that may require cleaning in certain applications (e.g., the food and biotechnology industries), reduce microorganisms to prevent contamination of the product streams, and optimize the process by restoring flux. See Munir Cheryan, Ultrafiltration and Microfiltration Handbook, Technical Publication, Lancaster, Pa., 1998, pages 237-288., 150875=Aminopolyacetate water conditioning salts suitable for use herein include the sodium, potassium lithium, ammonium, and substituted ammonium salts of the following acids: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediamine triacetic acid, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-nitrilodiacetic acid, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 1,2-diaminocyclohexanetetracetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid; and, mixtures thereof. Polyphosphonates useful herein specifically include the sodium, lithium and potassium salts of ethylene diphosphonic acid; sodium, lithium and potassium salts of ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonic acid and sodium lithium, potassium, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of ethane-2-carboxy-1,1-diphosphonic acid, hydroxymethanediphosphonic acid, carbonyldiphosphonic acid, ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1,2-triphosphonic acid, ethane-2-hydroxy-1,1,2-triphosphonic acid, propane-1,1,3,3-tetraphosphonic acid propane-1,1,2,3-tetraphophonic acid and propane 1,2,2,3-tetraphosphonic acid; and mixtures thereof. Examples of these polyphosphonic compounds are disclosed in British Pat. No. 1,026,366. For more examples see U.S. Pat. No. 3,213,030 to Diehl issued Oct. 19, 1965 and U.S. Pat. No. 2,599,807 to Bersworth issued Jun. 10, 1952. Aminopolyphosphonate compounds are excellent water conditioning agents and may be advantageously used in the present invention. Suitable examples include soluble salts, e.g. sodium, lithium or potassium salts, of diethylene thiamine pentamethylene phosphonic acid, ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid, hexamethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid, and nitrilotrimethylene phosphonic acid; and, mixtures thereof. Water soluble short chain carboxylic acid salts constitute another class of water conditioner for use herein. Examples include citric acid, gluconic acid and phytic acid. Preferred salts are prepared from alkali metal ions such as sodium, potassium, lithium and from ammonium and substituted ammonium. Suitable water soluble polycarboxylate water conditioners for this invention include the various ether polycarboxylates, polyacetal, polycarboxylates, epoxy polycarboxylates, and aliphatic-, cycloalkane- and aromatic polycarboxylates, 203986=Various liquid injection rates and air flow rates were tested to determine a reasonably low air and liquid combination while still obtaining adequate coverage of the ultrafiltration membrane. This was a visual observation based upon the flow and converage of the liquid out of the downstream end of the membrane. It was also intended to ensure that the majority of air and liquid does not permeate. After observing various test parameters, it was determined that the conditions of air delivery at 10 psig and liquid flow of 0.38 gpm resulted in a good atomized flow from the downstream end of a single 4 inch diameter by 38 inch long polysulfone membrane. This results in an air volume of about 20 scfm, a velocity of about 2-4 fps and an air to liquid ratio of about 183:1 to 307:1., 49449=Membranes that can be treated according to the invention include those provided in the form of spiral wound membranes, plate and frame membranes, tubular membranes, capillary membranes, hollow fiber membranes and the like. In the case of spiral wound membranes, it is expected that the industrial commonly available diameters of 3.8 inch, 6.2 inch, and 8.0 inch can be treated using multiple phase flow. The membranes can be generally characterized according to the size of the particles being filtered. Four common types of membrane types include microfiltration (MF) membranes, ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, nanofiltration (NF) membranes, and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Microfiltration membranes tend to block very fine heterogeneous particles and have pore sizes within the range of about 0.05 \u03bcm to about 10 \u03bcm. Microfiltration membranes can separate the largest macro molecules of proteins, separation of viruses, bacteria, and other microorganisms in the manufacture of artificial proteins, filtration of beer or wine, separation of various suspended substances, and removal of various kinds of turbidity. Ultrafiltration membranes have pore sizes within the range of about 0.02 \u03bcm to 0.1 \u03bcm and provide for separation of macro molecular substances with relative molecular mass within the range of about 1 kDa to about 1,000 kDa. An approximate theoretical size of a pore in nanofiltration membranes is about 0.02 \u03bcm or less for separation of polyvalent ions. In reverse osmosis, the pore size is theoretically about 0.002 \u03bcm or less and can remove a vast majority of monovalent ion substances from water. Because of the pore sizes, each membrane process operates at an optimal pressure. Microfiltration membrane systems generally operate at pressures less than about 30 psig. Ultrafiltration membrane systems generally operate at pressures of about 15-150 psig. Nanofiltration membrane systems generally operate at pressures of about 75-500 psig. Reverse osmosis membrane systems generally operate at pressures of about 200-2000 psig. Membranes can be formed from a variety of materials that are commonly used to form membranes including cellulose acetate, polyamide, polysulfone, vinylidene fluoride, acrylonitrile, stainless steel, ceramic, etc. These various membrane chemical types and other materials of construction may have specific pH, oxidant, solvent, chemical compatibility restrictions, and/or pressure limitations., 78815=The CIP program described in Table 2 is for an industrial polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane system designed to process whole whey from a cheese manufacturing process. The membrane system includes 5 stages, each having 10 vessels that each contain 4 membranes, each have the dimensions of 3.8 inch diameter by 38 inches long, and each contain 6.7 square meters of membrane area. The total membranes in the system is therefore 200 and the total membrane area is 1340 square meters. The total cleaning solution flow to each stage is approximately 300 gallons per minute. The total flow to each vessel is therefore approximately 30 gallons per minute. These flow rates allow for effective cross-flow velocity across the membrane thereby removing soil both by mechanical and chemical energy. In addition, pumps, valves, circuit lines and tanks are typically cleaned in series with the membranes and membrane holding vessels. The system is hydraulically flooded throughout the conventional cleaning cycle. The volume of solution used for the rinse steps is based upon the industry standard of using approximately 5 liters of cleaning solution for each square meter of membrane area. Similarly effective circulatory (recirculation) wash steps, provide about 3 liters of solution per square meter of membrane area. Therefore, in this example, wash steps provide a total solution volume of 2040 liters (1062 gallons) for adequate flooding, circulation and cleaning. Similarly, the rinse steps require a total solution to volume of 67000 liters (1770 gallons) for adequate rinsing). In this example the total water consumed is 14,869 gallons and the total wash time is 191 minutes or 3.2 hours., 35602=Chemical energy in the form of detergents and cleaners can be used to solubilize or disperse the foulant or soil. Thermal energy in the form of heat can be used to help the action of the chemical cleaners. In general, the greater the temperature of the cleaning the solution, the more effective it is as a cleaning treatment, although most membrane materials have temperature limitations due to the material of construction. Many membranes additionally have chemical limitations. Mechanical energy in the form of high velocity flow also contributes to the successful cleaning of membrane systems. See Munir Cheryan, Ultrafiltration and Microfiltration Handbook, Technical Publication, Lancaster, Pa., 1998, pages 237-288., 144913=A typical listing of zwitterionic classes, and species of these surfactants, is given in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678 issued to Laughlin and Heuring on Dec. 30, 1975. Further examples are given in \u201cSurface Active Agents and Detergents\u201d (Vol. I and II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch). The disclosures of zwitterionic surfactants in the above references are incorporated herein by reference., 263046=To further simulate an industrial vessel, using the membrane pilot plant equipment and protocols as previously described, four 3.8 inch diameter by 38 inch membranes were placed in series in a membrane vessel and soiled with a 10% whole milk solution. After soiling all four membranes were individually tested for water flux and ranged from 9-13% of their original clean water flux indicating highly soiled conditions on the membranes. They were treated in series using multiple phase flow with a chlorinated alkaline surfactant based chemistry consisting of 0.5% Ultrasil 25, 0.05% Ultrasil 01 and 0.15% XY-12; all of which are commercially available from Ecolab, Inc. The inlet pressure was set at 42 psig resulting in an air volume of 678 scfm, 34-130 fps. With the liquid injection rate set at 1.32 gpm, the resulting air to liquid ratio was 1000:1 to 3800:1. Temperature of the treatment solution ranged from 94 to 100 deg F. as measured at the retentate outlet. The acidic treatment solution consisted of 0.3% Ultrasil 76 also available from Ecolab, Inc. The treatment program utilized the multiple phase flow conditions previously described. Steps consisted of a 10 minute water rinse, 20 minute alkaline treatment, 10 minute water rinse, 10 minute acid treatment, 10 minute rinse, 30 minute alkaline treatment and a final 10 minute water rinse. Adequate rinse times were determined based upon conductivity measurements. The flux recovery of the four membranes was 43%, 40%, 34% and 25% respectively as they were stacked front to back in the horizontal vessel. The permeation of the treatment solution during the multiple phase flow was measured to be about 80% indicating that only 20% of the treatment solution was allowed to cross-flow tangential to the membrane. It is believed that the air pressure was above the bubble point pressure of the membranes thereby causing too much treatment solution to permeate. This is also evident by the fact that the membrane's flux recoveries were better in the front and progressively worsened towards the downstream. It is believed that this can be explained due to the greater volume of air and treatment solution near the front, but near the back 80% had already permeated thereby leaving only 20% for cross-flow. This demonstrates the requirement of the multiple phase flow to use air pressures below the bubble point pressure for each particular membrane type and treatment solution. The bubble point pressure is dependent upon many factors including membrane pore size, membrane type, surface tension of treatment solution and other chemical and physical parameters. It is also demonstrated in this example that if the particular treatment requires permeation, such as the case of achieving adequate antimicrobial treatment solution contact to the permeate side, the bubble point pressure can purposely be surpassed to maximize permeation., 266039=Using the membrane pilot plant equipment and protocols as previously described, four 3.8 inch diameter by 38 inch membranes were placed in series in a membrane vessel and soiled with a 10% whole milk solution. They were treated in series using a hybrid multiple phase flow and single phase flow. For the alkaline treatment step the multiple phase flow chemistry was Ultrasil 67 and Ultrasil 69 at a concentration of about 4 times the recommended use rates for conventional cleaning. The increased concentration is economically feasible given that one can circulate 75% less total solution using multiple phase flow which is due to the fact that the vessels and piping do not require a flooded state. After the 10 minute multiple phase treatment, a 10 minute soak step occurred, after which water was added to the system and allowed to circulate through the membranes in a single phase conventional manner for another 10 minutes. This addition of water diluted the concentrated chemistry to recommended use concentrations and circulated to remove any remaining soils. In this example, conventional single phase rinses and acid treatments followed. The complete program resulted in a 32% CIP time reduction as compared to a conventional single phase alkaline/chlorinated and acid CIP program. This particular program did not result in total water volume savings. Parameters for the multiple phase flow included an air inlet pressure of 14 psig, air volume of 20 scfm, velocity of 3 to 5 fps, liquid injection rate of 1.8 gpm at 120 deg F. This results in a air to liquid volume ratio of about 42:1 to 81:1. Resulting water flux recoveries were 94% for the total four membrane system and 78%, 79%, 85% and 116% respectively. It is expected that the improvement in this example can be at least partly attributed to the concentrated buffered treatment solution, the hybrid treatment method and the lower air pressure to minimize treatment solution permeation.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The above specification, examples and data provide a complete description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the invention. Since many embodiments of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, the invention resides in the claims hereinafter appended. Using the membrane pilot plant equipment and protocols as previously described, four 3.8 inch diameter by 38 inch membranes were placed in series in a membrane vessel and soiled with a 10% whole milk solution. They were treated in series using a hybrid multiple phase flow and single phase flow. For the alkaline treatment step the multiple phase flow chemistry was Ultrasil 67 and Ultrasil 69 at a concentration of about 4 times the recommended use rates for conventional cleaning. The increased concentration is economically feasible given that one can circulate 75% less total solution using multiple phase flow which is due to the fact that the vessels and piping do not require a flooded state. After the 10 minute multiple phase treatment, a 10 minute soak step occurred, after which water was added to the system and allowed to circulate through the membranes in a single phase conventional manner for another 10 minutes. This addition of water diluted the concentrated chemistry to recommended use concentrations and circulated to remove any remaining soils. In this example, conventional single phase rinses and acid treatments followed. The",
