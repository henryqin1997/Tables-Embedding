    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{96108=A communication interface 960 is provided for communication between the ambulatory unit 900 and the base unit 1000. The communication interface 960 may be a wireless interface, employing an RF, infra-red (IR), or other wireless communication medium. Alternatively, the communication interface 960 may be wired, using a cable in connection with the base unit 1000., 40861=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/817,347 filed Jun. 30, 2006., 94622=The ambulatory unit 900 gathers kinematic information from the various sensors disposed on the orthotic frame 100. The kinematic information may be processed locally by the ambulatory unit 900, and may be used to control actuators (such as the knee actuator 300) of the IKAFO in response to events or conditions that are detected or recognized by the ambulatory unit 900 based on analysis of the kinematic data. The ambulatory unit 900 also provides an interface for forwarding gathered data to the base unit 1000 for further processing and analysis., 96546=A control program may be stored in the ROM 922, or loaded into memory 920 from storage device 930, for execution by the microprocessor. The control program functions to read sensor data from the sensor inputs, and to evaluate the sensor data for control of actuators of the orthotic frame 100. The control program also may store the sensor data in the storage device 930 for later recall and transmission to the base unit 1000, or transmit the sensor data to the base unit 1000 in real time., 88826=The sensor set may include pressure sensors 810, strain gauges 820, a knee angle sensor 830, a knee status sensor 840, an ankle angle sensor 850, inertial measurement units (IMUs) 860, and foot contact sensors 870. An ambulatory data processing unit (ambulatory unit) 900 is co-located with the IKAFO (mounted to the orthotic frame 100 or carried by the patient, for example), to monitor the sensors and to process sensor data to control actuators of the IKAFO. The ambulatory unit 900 also provides data communication to a base unit 1000 where further analysis of the sensor data may be performed., 97119=The control program thus reads sensor data for both real-time control of the IKAFO 10 and for later analysis in the base unit 1000. Sensor data sampling rates for real-time functions are typically higher than sampling rates for later analysis. For example, a sampling rate of 100 Hz may be employed for real-time control functions, while a sampling rate of 30 Hz may be employed for data that is merely to be stored for later analysis at the base unit. For data storage, it can be recognized that data rate and the capacity of the storage device 930 influence the amount of information that may be recorded for later analysis.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It will be understood that the above-described embodiments of the invention are illustrative in nature, and that modifications thereof may occur to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, this invention is not to be regarded as limited to the embodiments disclosed herein, but is to be limited only as defined in the appended claims. Accordingly, while activation of the knee actuator 300 may be triggered by detection of a gait event, knowledge of the ambulatory activity that the patient is performing allows selection of a gait event most appropriate for the activity, as well as introduction or modification of a time delay factor between detection of the gait event and actuation of the knee actuator 300, or even modification of threshold levels used for gait event detection during the course of a given activity. Also, knowledge of an activity being performed by a patient may be used to alter such a control function from a baseline. In the event of upslope or downslope walking, timing between a given gait event and actuation of the knee actuator 300 may be affected for optimal assistance to the patient. In the ambulatory unit 900, information about the ambulatory activities, activity transitions, and activity or gait phases may be used to control actuators of the orthotic frame 100 to affect active assistive strategies to assist a patient's gait. For example, activation of the knee actuator",
