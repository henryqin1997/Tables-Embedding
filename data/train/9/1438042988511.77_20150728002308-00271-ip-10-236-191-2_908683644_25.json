            "I have NEVER had a problem with safety on campus! To start off the people of Yavapai and the town of Prescott in general are very friendly, and there are emergency stations all over campus in case you do need to call security. The campus is well lit at night and after a class I have that gets out around 9pm, I never feel insecure walking back to the dorms.",
            "To my knowledge there is no greek life on campus, and i prefer it that way.",
            "The clubs and activities at yavapai, even through there is no greek life are abundant and its easy to find something to do, especially with other students.",
            "Friendly, outgoing students are encounted everywhere at Yavapai, my first year at school I constantly was asking for directions and pointers and students were not bothered in any way to stop what they were doing and help me!",
            "The starbucks by the campus is where A LOT of students hang out, and the downtown area or whiskey row always has soemthing going on, its amazing during holidays and the 4th of July is a HUGE tourist attraction.",
            "I'd give this 10 stars if I could, Yavapai is SO affordable. I worked over the summers and paid for my school and books out of pocket both years I've been here!",
            "The town surrounding Yavapai has a small town feel but there is always something going on dowtown, about a 10 minute walk from the campus. There is also a starbucks and plenty of eating areas less than 10 minutes from the dorms.",
            "I LOVE the food, the meal plans are ridiculously enough food and the quality and diversity is great! There is even a coffee starbucks cafe in the library.",
            "Dorm life is not the greatest but its not the worst, I was onlh in the dorms for a short time, but prefer living off campus. There are PLENTY of apartments and housing close to the campus and are affordable.",
            "The teachers here are great! I have never had a problem with a teacher or their grading, I have plenty of teachers i would greatly reccomend.",
            "Any students wishing to go to Yavapai I would reccomend you come with an open mind, you dont need much else to do well at the college. It's plenty easy to make friends, get along with teachers, and do well in classes.",
            "Yavapai is a great community college to goto to save money and get in the groove of college life. The community around Yavapai is welcoming and easy to get around, even without a car. I am doing all my general education work here and I would highly reccomend others go there to save a substantial amount of money their forst two years."
