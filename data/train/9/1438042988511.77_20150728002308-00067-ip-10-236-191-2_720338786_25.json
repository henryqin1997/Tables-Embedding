Miles started on the outside pole, and jumped into the lead on lap one, followed by Jason Parish and Tim Easey. Lap five had fifth place, Bud Perry, looking to the inside of Easey, and setting his sights on Brian Heeney in third. Miles began to pull away, as Perry picked off Heeney for third and Larry Wallace drove into the fifth spot behind Heeney. Chris Ozanich made his bid for the fifth position but couldn\u2019t get it done. Lap 20 saw Miles deep into the rear of the field with Perry and Parish duking it out for second. Caution for a spin on lap 29 closed up the field, and on the restart, Miles once again pulled away from Parish, Wallace, Perry, and Heeney. At the checkered flag, it was Miles, Parish, Wallace, Perry, and Heeney. Heat wins went to Aaron Katz and Parish. Sixteen Performance Automotive Northwest Street Stocks timed in for their 25-lap feature. Bruce Jones and Jordan Harvey brought the field down to the green. Rob Patrick made his charge to the front by lap five, only to make a hard left into the infield on lap six. The leaders checked up for him, causing a wreck that claimed another of the top five in points. On the restart, Nate Moon went into the lead, with Damon Place breathing down his neck. By lap ten, it was Place, Mike Ammerman, Dane Long, Scott Sigman, and Moon. Lap 15 had Place still running up front, followed by Long, Sigman, Ammerman, and Marc Smith. With the top six nose to tail on lap 20, it was Place, Long, Sigman, Ammerman, and Smith at the line on lap 25. Dave Thorburn and Ed Newman Jr. won their heats. Trei Deubel met his match, when Kenny Clark returned to the Q106 Pony Stock division to set fast time. Seventeen ponies lined up for their feature, with Ken Dollarhite shown as the lap one leader. TJ Conroy worked his way into position to grab the top spot and tried to hold off Jimmy Scavarda for first. John Conroy and Kenny Clark were also on the move, and were sitting in the top five by lap 11, as Scavarda got around TJ Conroy for first. Scavarda set sail, with Clark and TJ Conroy side by side for second, as J. Conroy and Julie Dailey watched everything unfold ahead of them. At the stripe, it was Scavarda, Clark, TJ Conroy, J. Conroy, and Dailey. The Andrews Chevrolet Super Late Models saw Chris Place set fast time on B&L Truck Caps Night. Fifteen SLMs came down to the green with Jimmy Gallagher jumping out to lead lap one. Tim Ryan wasted no time and was headed for the front around Lee Taylor in second. Dave Stehouwer began his march to the front from his eighth starting position to sit in fifth behind Ryan, Taylor, Evan Barrett, and Bob Bauer on lap three. Stehouwer moved into the fourth position around Barrett on lap five and continued to ride on Bauer\u2019s rear bumper through lap 22, as Ryan opened up a gap between himself and Taylor. Stehouwer took to the high side and made his way around both Bauer and Taylor into second. Garry Duram moved into the top five on lap 25, and Ryan saw a 1 \u00bd second lead erased by a caution on lap 27. On the restart, Stehouwer tried to get around Ryan on the outside and continued his attempts through lap 40. At the conclusion, it was Ryan, Stehouwer, Taylor, Bauer, and Duram. Heat were won by Doc Dutton and Stan Perry.}",
