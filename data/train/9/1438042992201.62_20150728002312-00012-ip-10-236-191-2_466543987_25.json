In March on a pasture that had been \"heavily\" browsed by cattle, fringed sagebrush was 20.2 % of the bison diet with a standard error of 13.6. In October it was 11.3 % with a standard error of 5.6 [99]., 69648=Fringed sagebrush is also important to small game and nongame mammals. White-tailed jackrabbits in Colorado utilize fringed sagebrush in spring and autumn. Fringed sagebrush composes 15% of their spring diet and is an \"important\" part of their fall diet [41]. Also in Colorado, Hansen and Gold (1977) [57] observed black-tailed prairie dogs from June, 1973, to June, 1975, and desert cottontails from June, 1974, to June, 1975, as part of a study to determine competition with cattle for food. Fringed sagebrush was not part of the cattle's diet but the researchers reported fringed sagebrush to be part of the diet of both black-tailed prairie dogs and desert cottontails. Fringed sagebrush was one of the \"most important\" food items for black-tailed prairie dogs and made up 8% of their total diet. Fringed sagebrush made up 15% of the total diet of desert cottontails. Their results expressed as an average (\ufffd Standard Error) percentage of seasonal diets were:, 34234=In the mixed-grass prairie of Canada, fringed sagebrush begins growth about mid-April. Flower stalks appear towards the end of July and flower buds are present about the end of the 1st week in August. Fringed sagebrush is in full bloom 2 weeks later. Seed ripens by mid-September and the foliage dries \"soon\" afterward [30]., 71744=Sage-grouse and greater prairie-chickens utilize fringed sagebrush as both adults and juveniles. Food habits of greater sage-grouse in central Montana were studied by Peterson [102] during the summers of 1966 and 1968. Fringed sagebrush was 1 of the 5 most utilized plants and began to appear in the diet of sage-grouse chicks when they were 4 weeks old but only as a trace. Use of fringed sagebrush increased until the chicks were 11 to 12 weeks old., 1311=AUTHORSHIP AND CITATION: McWilliams, Jack 2003. Artemisia frigida. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online].

FEIS ABBREVIATION: ARTFRI SYNONYMS: No entry NRCS PLANT CODE [122]: ARFR4 COMMON NAMES: fringed sagebrush pasture sage prairie sagebrush fringed sagewort TAXONOMY: The scientific name of fringed sagebrush is Artemisia frigida Willd. (Asteraceae) [53,66,71,74,85]., 72989=Another study of sage-grouse in central Montana [126] observed food habits of adult sage-grouse. Use of fringed sagebrush began in March and continued through November. Percent frequency and volume of fringed sagebrush in 299 sage-grouse crops was:, 62508=Food habits of Rocky Mountain elk in the northern Great Plains were studied by Wydeven and Dahlgren [134] in Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota. They found fringed sagebrush was an \"important\" or \"major\" plant in the diet of Rocky Mountain elk in fall, winter, and spring. Percent of fringed sagebrush in elk rumen contents, along with standard deviation, from July, 1976, to August, 1977 was:, 56891=Many large game animals utilize fringed sagebrush throughout western United States and Canada. In a 1971 literature review, Bayless [17] discusses use of fringed sagebrush by big game in Montana. He summarized big game use of fringed sagebrush as:, 67291=As part of the same study, Bayless [16] analyzed contents of 18 pronghorn rumen samples collected during the winter of 1966/1967. Frequency of occurrence and volume of plant taxa, both in percentages, for fringed sagebrush were:, 68170=In a 1963 study of pronghorn diet at 2 sites in Saskatchewan, Dirschl [35] analyzed rumens of pronghorns and determined they utilized fringed sagebrush year-round. His results, presented as percent of diet by weight, were:, 72234=Use of fringed sagebrush by adult sage-grouse occurred in August and September. Percent frequency and volume of fringed sagebrush in the diet of adult sage-grouse for these 2 months were:, 28515=Asexual regeneration: Fringed sagebrush's ability to reproduce asexually is disputed. Fringed sagebrush can be regenerated from cuttings collected from February through May [68]. Under favorable conditions, fringed sagebrush increases in basal cover by layering [121]. Whisenant and Uresk [130] report 38% of fringed sagebrush resprouted after a prescribed fire in a mixed-prairie in South Dakota. SITE CHARACTERISTICS: Fringed sagebrush occupies a wide variety of sites. Most typically, it grows in full sunlight in dry, coarse, shallow soils. However, it tolerates moderate shade well and thrives on ditch banks and along streams [121]. On winter ranges in western Utah and eastern Nevada, fringed sagebrush may occur in dense stands along shallow depressions that collect moisture from summer rains [90]., 98701=Herbicides: A 1970 review of herbicidal treatments for fringed sagebrush is provided by Ryerson and others [110]., 26720=Seedling establishment/growth: Environmental conditions during June and early July are critical in the emergence and growth of fringed sagebrush. Most seedlings of fringed sagebrush emerge in spring and early summer, enabling them to temporarily exploit the period for growth when soil water is highest and temperatures are moderate. However, fringed sagebrush seeds in the soil can germinate and seedlings can be recruited anytime during the growing season [11]., 49151=Kirsch and Kruse [78] state cover of fringed sagebrush was \"unchanged\" by burning on the mixed-grass prairie of North Dakota. However, their definition of unchanged includes a range of change in cover from plus 99% to minus 49% for the plants studied. DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE: Bailey and Anderson [13] conducted an experiment in Alberta designed to determine effects of spring and fall prescribed burning of a rough fescue (Festuca altaica)/short bristle needle and thread (Hesperostipa curtiseta) grass community. They noted fringed sagebrush canopy coverage was reduced by both spring and fall burns. After an August, 1994, wildfire in northern dry mixed prairie in southeastern Alberta, fringed sagebrush appeared to decline in overall abundance. Pooled data from 1995 to 1997 show a decrease in estimates of fringed sagebrush's percent weight of total vegetation weight on burned sites relative to unburned sites for both upland and lowland areas [44]:, 63839=Bartman [15] utilized tame mule deer to determine diet of mule deer in pinyon (Pinus spp.)/juniper (Juniperus spp.)/mixed shrub winter range during a 2-year experiment in Colorado. Fringed sagebrush was used most heavily by mule deer in February and March during both years. No use or only trace amounts were noted in the remaining winter months. Currie and others [32] also utilized tame mule deer in a Colorado study in managed ponderosa pine habitats to determine if diets of mule deer and cattle were in competition. Their results indicate mule deer utilize fringed sagebrush during the growing season, not just winter months. Fringed sagebrush was ranked 9th of 129 species grazed by mule deer and percentage of total diet of fringed sagebrush by month was:, 34605=A shortgrass prairie in Colorado observed by Dickinson and Dodd [33] showed fringed sagebrush began growth at the beginning of April with flower buds present in mid-July and mature floral buds by the end of the month. Floral buds and open flowers were present by the end of August and ripening fruit by the beginning of September. By the end of September, the plants had buds, flowers, green and ripe fruit and were dispersing seeds. Early November brought winter dormancy but seeds continued to disperse. Flowering of fringed sagebrush was delayed because of a dry autumn during the study and after flowering; the same conditions apparently brought on earlier seed dispersal., 19824=In a 1984 study of mycorrhizal inoculum in a ponderosa pine forest in Colorado, Kovacic and others [81] determined fringed sagebrush was mycorrhizal and Dittberner and Olson [36] describe fringed sagebrush as endomycorrhizal. RAUNKIAER [104] LIFE FORM: Phanerophyte Chamaephyte REGENERATION PROCESSES: Fringed sagebrush reproduces by seed [30] produced by both ray and disc flowers [90]. Under favorable conditions, fringed sagebrush increases in basal cover by layering [121]., 88398=The achenes germinated very well over most of a range of temperatures from 63 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (17-24 oC) for 8 hours and 53 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit (11.5- 31 oC) for 16 hours. Temperatures of 93 degrees Fahrenheit (34 oC) or higher strongly depressed germination percentages and lengthened germination times. Optimum germination was at a constant temperature of approximately 63 degrees Fahrenheit (17 oC) with a mean germination time of 5.4 days, and alternating temperatures 56 to 75 degrees (13.5-17 oC) for 8 hours and 74 degrees Fahrenheit (23.5 oC) for 16 hours with a mean germination time of 5.3 days., 18136=Roots: In a 1965 study of grassland species in Saskatchewan, Coupland and Johnson [31] suggest roots of fringed sagebrush have \"sufficient plasticity\" to adjust to a semiarid climate by developing taproots in periods when moisture penetration permits, but to make use of moisture near the surface in habitats where deeper supplies are continually limiting due to runoff. In locations where moisture is often deficient near the soil surface, but where occasional moisture penetration to considerable depth permits establishment of deep roots, the taproot system is well developed. Taproots are not found where deep penetration of moisture is prevented by excessive runoff or where moisture supply in the upper layers of soil is more dependable., 65461=Bayless [16] studied pronghorn winter diet in Montana. He found pronghorn utilized fringed sagebrush more than would be expected when compared to percentage of total vegetation available in February and March:, 76915=In a 1946 study of white-tailed deer diet in the Black Hills of South Dakota, Hill [62] ranked palatability of fringed sagebrush for the 4 seasons as:}",

VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES: Germination of fringed sagebrush differs between field and laboratory conditions with field germination lower than laboratory germination. Fringed sagebrush had an overall field germination rate of 8.9 \ufffd 2.3% after being tested at 3 different sites in Montana for 3 years [60]. In a laboratory study of fringed sagebrush germination [111], heads of the achenes had to be threshed and extra plant material sifted and removed. No other pretreatment was necessary for germination. Cleaned seed of fringed sagebrush averages 3,875,000 per pound (8,545/gm) [90].
