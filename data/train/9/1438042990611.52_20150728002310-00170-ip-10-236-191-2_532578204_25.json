Using the same example (e.g., if the required tax year is the calendar year), the deferral period would be two months for an elected tax year ending in October (e.g., Deferral Ratio to enter is 167), while the deferral period would be one month for an elected tax year ending in November (e.g., Deferral Ratio to enter is 083)., 82926=The Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act of 2007 provides a bridge to impose a penalty on a paid tax preparer who fails to sign the returns they prepare. In order for Compliance to determine whether a penalty should be assessed, the legislation requires Submission Processing, during the initial processing of the return to capture certain paid preparer information. Additional information can be found in Work Request WSP082292OTH - Forms 706NA and 8752 ISRP Capture of Paid Preparer Information., 33965=In January 2014, the Taxpayer Notice Code (TPNC) 90 Math Error (ME) Code literals were programmed into the OnLine Notice Review (OLNR) Retype Application for Notice Review (NR).
