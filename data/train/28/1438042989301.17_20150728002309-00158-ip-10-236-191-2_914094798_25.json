TestBase should do already does a \\Drupal::setContainer($this->container). So, instances of $this->container->get('servicename') could also be cleaned up in tests.

    "textAfterTable": "View ] StatisticsSettingsForm takes an injected module handler and container, interestingly. Not sure about the changes in DUTB; I have a sneaking suspicion there might have been an \"intended\" behavior here of using drupal_container() to get the original container rather than the test environment's. Ditto ModuleApiTest, ModulesDisabledUpgradePathTest, and UpgradePathTestBase. We might need to update the instructions to skip tests on a first pass and do them separately.
