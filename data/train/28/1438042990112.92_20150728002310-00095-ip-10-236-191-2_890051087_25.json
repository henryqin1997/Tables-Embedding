            "The campus is very safe. However, it is still a decent size city so it's important to be aware of your surroundings (cliche).",
            "Nashville is considered an up-and-coming hipster city. In fact, it's behind Seattle as being hipster-friendly. But honestly, Nashville is welcoming to virtually any kind of student. Many of my classmates have relocated from California, Colorado, New York, and even from Africa and they all have decided to make Nashville their new home.",
            "Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any at this time.",
            "Yes, it is expensive. However, VU is one of the top 50 schools in the world and currently ranked #17 in the nation. The program I'm in is ranked in the top 10 in the nation. It goes without saying that this private school is by far one of the best not only in the south, but in the country.",
            "Nashville has a great student life to offer. Although, Nashville isn't a very big city (#25 in the USA), it does have a big city feel in a smaller city. We have the Tennessee Titans, Nashville Predators, VU Commodores, and not to mention...it's MUSIC CITY, USA!!! It's very likely that you'll spot Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban, or Nicole Kidman at the local Starbucks. Also, actors from the show Nashville are frequently seen just hanging around town as well.",
            "The university has several on-campus dining venues with several of them being at the teaching hospital. These include Taco Bell, Ben & Jerry's, Pizza Hut, and Subway, just to name a few. Also, Rand Hall Student Life Center is a cool hang out spot with a 3rd floor pool hall and bar -- fun to visit on game day.",
            "The professors are extremely supportive of your success. After all, the goal of VU is to cultivate future leaders. However, this is not to say that the academics is easy -- it's not. You WILL be studying a lot. You WILL be in the library almost daily. And you WILL be successful.",
            "Possess life experience!!! Vanderbilt University prides itself on having an EXTREMELY diverse student culture. Not only are they looking for academic performance, but are looking for students who are more than students. They want you to be passionate about the field that you are pursuing. For instance, if you are wanting to get admitted to pursue engineering, then it is not only imperative that your SATs/ACTs be excellent, but that you have been exposed to the field of engineering in various ways including high school math/science clubs, competitive engineering teams, shadowing/volunteering with professional engineers, be a student member of a professional engineering organization, etc.",
            "As a current graduate student at Vanderbilt I can attest to the difficulty in getting admitted. However, once you begin you will be glad that you chose a great university. The professors are encouraging and supportive, and the environment is conducive for success."

About half of the houses are older but renovated and the other half were newly built in 2007. By living with other freshmen exclusively, it creates a sense of community where everyone is pretty much going through the same struggles. The houses compete all year to win the Common's Cup- a tradition that builds further community within respective houses. PSA: North house rocks, 243272=The Vanderbilt campus is a natural arboretum, which means there are a variety of animals on campus. For one, the squirrel population outnumbers that of student by a 3:1 ratio. On a rainy evening, try walking around the Commons dining hall and don't be surprised when a cute, fluffy bunny dashes across your path. For finals, Vanderbilt offers a variety of activities to help students de-stress. One of these is a De-Stress Fest where massages, manicures, pedicures and food are provided for students to take the edge of finals week., 25637=Small class sizes. Student to faculty ratio 9:1. Also the prestige of the school is well known., 2345=Vanderbilt is currently ranked #18 in the nation, tied with Notre Dame and Emory. Many of you prospective students may be wondering, Why should I pay $37,000 per year for my college tuition? In order to attend an equivalently ranked school, you would only be paying about $700 less for Emory and about $300 less for Notre Dame. But, please give me a chance to convince you that the experience and education that Vanderbilt has to offer is worth your $300 - $700 extra dollars. 1) Vanderbilt provides a great balance between work and play. Many students live by the motto: work hard, play harder...so if partying is your thing then you will find plenty of opportunities to reward yourself for all of your A's and your well-earned B's. But, the great thing about Vandy is that if you prefer not to hang around the party scene scattered with frat juice, black lights, the Ying Yang Twins, and party fouls, then you too are not alone. There are plenty of work-a-holics that can find pure joy and soothing happiness simply by correctly solving a differential equation, but don't want the buzz of a cool beer to help relax their nerves. 2) Vandy is a great place to make friends from all over the U.S. and the world. I had the opportunity to go to one of my state universities, but after visiting my friends there I realized how happy I was that I had decided to go to Vanderbilt instead. All of my friend's friends were the same people from our high school or other people from our state. They had learned nothing about other parts of our glorious country or world through their friendships. At Vanderbilt, I have friends from California, New York, Montana, Maryland, Wisconsin, Texas, Japan, Florida, India, North Carolina, Great Britain, Ohio, Missouri, Georgia, Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Massachusetts, Tennessee...do you get the point? I have friends living all over our planet...I mean, how awesome is that! Many students at Vanderbilt are open to having friendships with people of a different race, ethnicity, religion, etc. If I were to go to any major city in the U.S. right now, then I feel like I would have at least one person nearby that I would feel comfortable calling up if I needed help or needed a place to stay. My friends at Vandy are real friends. We care about each other's success and well-being. 3) Are you into music? I mean most people like some kind of music, right? Well, if you do like music then you are in luck because Vanderbilt is located in Nashville, TN...aka Music City, USA (or the Country Music Capital of the World). Okay, after reading that last part you probably had one of two reactions: ughhhhhhh I HATE country music! Game over...I will never go to Vandy. OR... You know I like my chicken fried, cold beer on a Friday night, a pair of jeans that fits just right, and the radio up. COUNTRY MUSIC HATERS KEEP READING 'cause I have good news for you: if you really despise country music then I promise you will do just fine in Nashville! There are tons of bars, concert halls, little dives, cafes, frats, and clubs where country music is not preformed. Many very talented starving artists have taken up root in Nashvegas and they too would absolutely love your support! So let all those Country-music lovers go support the rising country stars and songwriters in the Honkey-tonk part of Downtown and the rundown bluegrass bars. Just so you understand the wide variety of artists that play in Nashville here is a VERY small sampling of who I saw play last year, The Avett Brothers, Lil Wayne, Grassroots, The Wooten Brothers, the Flaming Lips, songwriters (for Garth Brooks, Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, etc.), Santigold, N.E.R.D., Pat Green, the Ying Yang Twins (at a frat party...good times), the Blair school of music, K'naan, T.I. (his last performance before he went to prison), Sarah Watkins (from Nickel Creek), etc. Yeah, so if you like music, then you will LOVE Nashville. 4) Another cool thing about living in Nashville is the celebrity sightings. It's no L.A., but it's still fun, especially if you don't come from a celebrity-filled home town. Taylor Swift randomly shows up at the Bluebird Cafe to play along with other artists or can be seen grabbing some pancakes in Hillsboro's Pancake Pantry. Nichole Kidman also enjoys these infamous pancakes, and shows up with hubby, Keith Urban, at the Green Hills Mall movie theater. And one night while dining at the restaurant called Watermark, I sat a few tables away from the handsome James Marsden...he also ran the Country Music Half Marathon in April. 5) Vanderbilt is going green...yeah, I know, so in right now. Vanderbilt's campus is a national arboretum and over near the fabulous freshman dorms is the Commons Center. This grand building is Vandy's trofeewife. Vanderbilt could not be more proud of her flush down, flush up toilets, automatic everything, and green this, green that. Vandy still has a long way to go on the green side of things, but if being environmentally conscious/friendly is one of your passions then you will be able to really help change the Vandy world with your ideas of how to greenify our already fabulous school and beautiful campus. But, if you could care less about all this green talk, then hey at least you get to benefit from from the people that do care...so going to Vanderbilt is a win-win. 6) Vandy is part of the SEC...which is incredibly fun. We get to go up against big state schools like Alabama, UGA, Ole Miss, etc. Yeah, so us Commodores might not be exactly well known for our athletic programs, but we do surprise people every now and then. I mean, who would have though that Vandy would beat Auburn 14-13 last fall! So it's always fun to show up to the sporting events, not only because those huge SEC athletes that are making touchdowns, dribbling down the court, or hitting a home run are your friends, but because they will probably give you a good reason to cheer as a proud Commodore when you are least expecting it. I believe and I promise that Vanderbilt University is a bang for the buck. If you're still reading at this point then I hope I have convinced you to come join me and my fellow students at Vandyland this fall. I would not trade my past year at Vandy for any other experience in the world...and yes, I know that statement sounds vague and slightly not believable, but it's the truth. I LOVE Vanderbilt. GO 'DORES!, 134317=I have a meeting here on July 11th and I plan on eating lunch in the Commons Hall I'm not sure if they have and Honors Hall at Vandy but if so I'd love to be enrolled here.But I'm still kind of worried about my ACT score it was a 25 but that was my first time so I'll probably take again twice before I apply here. However, does anyone know if they superscore or not?, 268312=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Check out the majors and classes and make sure you will like what they have. The Commons for freshmen living is amazing. Everyone at Vandy is nice for the most part so ask any questions you have, don't hesitate. Bang for the buck Vanderbilt always has great events on campus. All kinds too - comedians, music groups, magicians, dancers, sporting events, and many more. Last year we had guests such as Lil Wayne, T.I., The Flaming Lips, a comedian that appears on Chelsea Lately occasionally, and the co-author or the great book 'Freakonomics'. The education is top notch, just make sure they have your intended area of study and take a look at the class offerings. The financial aid services at Vandy are excellent and the staff is incredibly nice. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I wish the school was a little bit less expensive but it is worth it. Am enjoying being here I am from a small rural town in MO and that is not my style of living. I prefer to live in suburbs or a city and Nashville offers a great mix of both. Exploring the city while you have free time is always great because there is always something new to",
