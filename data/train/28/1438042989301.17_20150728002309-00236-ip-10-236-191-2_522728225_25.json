The calculation is based on mining taxable income and is only finalised once that has been assessed by the South African Revenue Services. Payments are made in accordance with an agreed schedule. Royalties payable to the Royal Bafokeng Nation from 1 July 2007 have been pre-paid. Refer note 10., 49348=The Employee Share Ownership Programme (ESOP) for South African operations provides for as broad-based participation as possible by employees in the Morokotso Trust and is primarily for the benefit of historically disadvantaged employees in the A, B and C Paterson bands in the employ of the company before 4 July 2008. The trust acquired 16.4 million shares on behalf of employees. Each employee in the A, B and C Paterson bonds has an equal stake in the Trust., 302500=On 14 May 2007, the group acquired the entire issued and to be issued share capital of African Platinum Plc, an exploration and development business focussed on platinum group metals. The acquired business did not contribute to group revenue or profit for the year under review given the explorative nature of its activities and that a mine is still to be developed., 264122=An expense for the commitment to contribute up to R170 million up to 30 June 2017 to the Impala Bafokeng Trust amounting to a liability of R87.5 million (present value of estimated future payments) with a corresponding community development expense to the income statement., 55483=This accounting policy relates to transactions where the group grants or sells equity instruments to people in the context of empowerment in terms of the Broad-Based Black Empowerment Act No 53 of 2003. The difference between the fair value and the selling price of the equity instruments granted or sold is accounted for as an expense through the income statement as a share-based compensation charge. Refer note 1.19 for discussion of share-based payments., 151832=This goodwill is based on the provisional purchase price allocation of fair value. The purchase price allocation will be finalised in FY2008, subject to an independent review of resources acquired., 44480=The group operates or participates in a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees. The pension plans are funded by payments from employees and by relevant group companies to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. Contributions to these funds are expensed as incurred. The assets of the different plans are held by independently managed trust funds. These funds are governed by either the South African Pension Fund Act of 1956 or Zimbabwean law. The defined benefit plans are multi-employer plans, where sufficient information is not available to account for them as defined benefit plans; they are accounted for in substance as defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans are subject to actuarial valuations at intervals of no more than three years., 262760=On 30 November 2005, Implats advised that pursuant to its review of the Ambatovy Project, it had delivered a formal notice of withdrawal under the shareholders agreement. While there were still synergies for Implats\u0092 own nickel production cost profile, in Implats\u0092 view, the project as a whole did not meet Implats\u0092 hurdle rates. The amount written off consisted of the following: investment in the project of R127.1 million and a bankable feasibility study cost of R66.0 million, giving a total amount written off of R193.1 million., 250141=During the year, the group entered into forward exchange contracts to cover the foreign currency risk relating to the highly probable acquisition of Afplats. This transaction was accounted for as a cash flow hedge. The full amount was settled before year-end. The cash flow hedges occurred from 3 May 2007 to 14 May 2007. A R17.1 million loss was recognised in equity during the period. This amount was transferred from equity and included in the carrying amount of the net assets acquired (note 16)., 188715=During the period under review, 16.4 million shares (2.1 million shares pre-subdivision) were issued in terms of an approved Employee Share Ownership Programme. The programme was put in place in 2006 and the shares were incorporated in calculations for 2006., 170122=The Barplats Investments Limited loan bore annual nominal interest at JIBAR plus 300 basis points, compounded monthly in arrears. The loan was repaid during the 2007 financial year., 148420=During the group\u0092s business planning cycle in 2006, the long-term assumptions regarding metal prices and the improvement in mining and processing at Marula indicated that the total impairment provision for this CGU was no longer necessary, therefore an amount of R583.1 million was reversed., 301091=During 2006, 0.1 million shares were acquired for an amount of R1.5 million (AU$0.3 million)., 61093=The group monitors its exposure to fluctuating interest rates. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested with short-term maturity dates, therefore the group is only exposed to cash flow interest risk. The group's primary exposure in respect of borrowings is detailed in note 17. At 30 June 2007 (2006: nil), the group did not consider there to be any significant exposure to interest rate risk., 185083=The ordinary shares of the holding company were subdivided whereby each ordinary share of 20 cents was subdivided into eight ordinary shares of 2.5 cents each. The subdivided shares commenced trading on the JSE Limited on 6 November 2006., 328518=Impala Platinum Holdings Limited \u2014 Annual Report 2007, 288818=These financial statements do not reflect this dividend and related STC payable. The dividend will be accounted for in shareholders\u0092 equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending 30 June 2008., 266712=In 2006 the group announced the signing of agreements with Tubatse Platinum (Pty) Limited, Marula Community Trust and Mmakau Mining (Pty) Limited relating to the acquisition of a stake in Marula Platinum (Proprietary) Limited. The compensation charge represents the difference between the selling price of the shares and the fair value at 30 June 2006. Although the agreements were dated 1 July 2006, the transactions were in essence completed on 30 June 2006., 169057=As an integral part of the sale of the group\u0092s shares in Lonplats in 2005, an amount of R617.5 million was made available in equal amounts as loans to the following BEE companies:, 263401=On 31 May 2006, the group announced that agreement had been reached with the government of Zimbabwe relating to the release of mining claims comprising 36% of Zimplats\u0092 resource base, with a market value of US$153 million, in exchange for empowerment credits amounting to US$102 million and a future payment of US$51 million in cash or equity in a joint venture that is to be established. The loss represents the carrying value of the mining claims transferred in exchange for empowerment credits. The transaction with regard to the US$51 million will only be recognised once there is more clarity on its outcome., 171665=In March 2007, the group finalised a deal with Royal Bafokeng Holdings (Proprietary) Limited. In terms of this transaction, Impala Platinum Limited agreed to pay the Royal Bafokeng Nation (RBN) all royalties due to them, thus effectively discharging any further obligation to pay royalties. In turn the RBN purchased, through Royal Bafokeng Impala Investment Holding Company (Pty) Limited and Royal Bafokeng Tholo Investment Holding Company (Pty) Limited, 75.1 million shares in Implats, giving them a 13.4% holding in the listed entity., 184972=A subdivision of shares was approved at the annual general meeting held on 12 October 2006., 153562=Impala Platinum Holdings Limited has provided a guarantee to Absa Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited for its share of the borrowing by Two Rivers Platinum (Proprietary) Limited until such time as the technical completion tests of the project have been met. At 30 June 2007, the exposure under this guarantee amounted to R292.9 million (2006: R210.6 million)., 204738=The Share Option Scheme was closed to future grants with effect from October 2004., 240905=(1) The Employee Share Option Participation Scheme (ESOPS) for broad-based economic empowerment was introduced in 2007, 148329=In 2005, Marula\u0092s mining assets were impaired due to a change in the mining method., 288583=At the board meeting on 30 August 2007, a final dividend in respect of 2007 of 700 cents per share amounting to R4,228.6 million was approved. Secondary taxation on Companies (STC) on the dividend will amount to R528.6 million.}",

All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. Assets are not depreciated while the residual value equals or exceeds the carrying value of the asset. Amortisation is calculated on cost less the residual value of the assets or component of the asset where applicable. Amortisation methods and amortisation rates are applied consistently within each asset class except where significant individual assets have been identified which have different amortisation patterns. Residual values are reviewed at least annually. Amortisation is not adjusted retrospectively for changes in the residual amount. Other assets consist of furniture and fittings, information technology equipment and vehicles. Shafts, mining development and infrastructure Individual mining assets are amortised using the units-of-production method based on their respective estimated economically recoverable proved and probable mineral reserves, limited to the life of mine.
