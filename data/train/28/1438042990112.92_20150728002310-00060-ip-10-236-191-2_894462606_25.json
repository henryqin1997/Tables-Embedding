Even so, it has been relatively easy to make friends and there is always something to do on campus. You can try your hand at intramural sports of all kinds and of course there are the regular type clubs and Greek life. Am learning a lot I am learning a great deal at the University of North Alabama. The instructors seem to genuinely care about your success in the classroom. I enjoy the fact that they take the extra time needed to make sure each student is reaching their full potential.
