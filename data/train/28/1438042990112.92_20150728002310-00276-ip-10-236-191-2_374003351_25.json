Multiple paths are installed for external peers that are from the same autonomous system and are equal cost (according to the BGP best-path algorithm). Similarly, multiple paths are installed for internal peers that are equal cost based on the BGP best-path algorithm. The IGP metric to the BGP next hop is the same as the best-path IGP metric unless the router is configured for unequal cost iBGP multipath or eiBGP multipath.
