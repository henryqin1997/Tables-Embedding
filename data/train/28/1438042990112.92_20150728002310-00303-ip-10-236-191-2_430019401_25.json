            "METHOD FOR ORIENTING A PARALLAX BARRIER SCREEN ON A DISPLAY SCREEN - A method for orienting a parallax barrier screen on a display screen with picture elements x(i,j) in a grid comprising rows i and columns j for the purpose of producing a display screen for three-dimensional representation. This method includes the steps of: temporary application of a positioning marker, observation of the positioning marker by means of a camera, relative orientation of the display screen, removal of the positioning marker, positioning of the parallax barrier screen in front of the picture area of the display screen display of a test picture, which comprises various views, where k=1, . . . , n and n=6 or n=7, on the picture elements x(i,j) with rows i and columns j, observation of the displayed test picture through the parallax barrier screen by the camera, orientation of the parallax barrier screen in front of the display screen. The method according to the invention can be carried out quickly and is therefore suitable for industrial use for the manufacture of display screens for three-dimensional representation.",

In at least one embodiment, the method includes spiral scanning of an examination object lying on a patient table, with the aid of a beam emanating from at least one focus, and the aid of a detector arrangement of planar design lying opposite the focus, the detector arrangement supplying output data that represent the attenuation of the beams during passage through the examination object; filtering the output data; weighted back projection of the filtered output data; and visualizing a layer or a volume on a display unit on the basis of the back projected output data. In at least one embodiment, a non constant pitch of the spiral scanning is taken into account computationally during the back projection. In at least one embodiment, a CT machine is disclosed for carrying out the above named method. 11-20-2008 20110293160 Iterative Reconstruction Of CT Images Without A Regularization Term - A method is disclosed for reconstructing image data of an examination object from measured data, wherein the measured data was captured previously during a relative rotary motion between a radiation source of a computed tomography system and the examination object. In at least one embodiment, the measured data is modified to achieve a particular",
