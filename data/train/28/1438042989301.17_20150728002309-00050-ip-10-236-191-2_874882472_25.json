It contains a few small rural primary schools, some small town primary and secondary schools, and a large number of city schools. As of June 2011, there are 538 primary and secondary schools in Auckland, enrolling over 267,000 students.[1], 10292=In New Zealand schools, students begin formal education in Year 1 at the age of five.[2] Year 13 is the traditional final year of secondary education, although students are entitled to stay in secondary school until the 1 January following their 19th birthday if need be. The list of schools below is broken up into primary and intermediate schools, which includes contributing primary schools (Years 1\u20136), full primary schools (Years 1\u20138), and intermediate schools (Years 7 and 8); secondary schools, which includes normal secondary schools (Years 9-13), secondary schools with intermediate (Years 7\u201313), junior secondary schools (Years 7\u201310) and senior secondary schools (Years 11\u201313); composite schools (Years 1\u201313); and special schools and teen parent units. Primary and intermediate schools are further broken up into the local board of the Auckland Council in which each school is located., 7758=The socioeconomic decile indicates the socioeconomic status of the school's catchment area. A decile of 1 indicates the school draws from a poor area; a decile of 10 indicates the school draws from a well-off area.[5] The decile ratings used here come from the Ministry of Education Te Kete Ipurangi website and from the decile change spreadsheet listed in the references. The deciles were last revised using information from the 2006 Census.[6] The roll of each school changes frequently as students start school for the first time, move between schools, and graduate. The rolls given here are those provided by the Ministry of Education, and are based on figures from March 2015.[7] The Ministry of Education institution number links to the Te Kete Ipurangi page for each school.}",
