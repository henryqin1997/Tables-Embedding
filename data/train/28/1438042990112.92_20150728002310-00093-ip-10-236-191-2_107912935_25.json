Ronan Chabot and his SMG buggy (+2'46') lie third. Argentina's Orlando Terranova and his BMW\u00a0X3 (+6'26') are fourth, followed by Leonid Novitskiy (+9'33') and his Mini. Next comes Nasser Al-Attiyah's Qatar Red Bull Team buggy, with a 10'25' deficit. Then it's Lucio \u00c1lvarez and his Toyota (+12'27') followed by Krzysztof Holowczyc and his Mini (+14'00'). Carlos Souza and his Great Wall (+15'48') are ninth and Bernard Errandonea and his SMG buggy round off the Top 10. Today's major casualties were Carlos Sainz (eleventh in the overall, 16'21' down), Nani Roma (fifteenth, 24'28' down) and Guerlain Chicherit (nineteenth, 30'50' down)., 7434=The only one of the Patronelli brothers to start the 2013 Dakar is keeping it in the family. Marcos won today's stage with 1'06' over Sebastian Husseini. Ignacio Casale leapfrogged Tom\u00e1s Maffei for third after the checkpoint. Nevertheless, he conceded 8'54' to the winner, with Maffei a further 30' back., 9716=Francisco L\u00f3pez (KTM) left the bivouac at 5:30\u00a0am local time, heading south-east on the famous Panamericana Sur, which swerves away from the Pacific coast near Pisco. He was followed by veteran Frans Verhoeven (Yamaha) and the two revelations in the Top 5, Pablo Quintanilla (Honda) and Patricio Cabrero (Kawasaki). It will then be 2012 Dakar champion Cyril Despres' turn to tackle the 85\u00a0km link section leading to the start of today's special: a 242\u00a0km quest on the sand and dunes which will take the riders back to the bivouac in Pisco., 15639=The second stage of the 2013 Dakar is a loop around Pisco. After an opener which was more of a warm-up, the racers are about to get down to business with a 327\u00a0km trek on sand. An 85\u00a0km link section and a 242\u00a0km special entirely on the dunes await, but it's not here that the race will be at its most difficult. We'll have to wait until Monday for that Jaw-dropping landscapes are there for the crews to admire if they have a second to spare as they fight to avoid the traps of the sea of sand. There were no surprises during the first day, apart from American Robby Gordon's stop during the special, in the Car category. Marcos Patronelli, the runner-up to his brother in 2012, made the Top 3 in the Quad category. Only Gerard de Rooy and his team banged their first on the table to show their ambition in the Truck category. The favourites are still very much in the game, as St\u00e9phane Peterhansel and Cyril Despres started the rally calmly, almost cautiously. Their ample experience has taught them that a flash of brilliance here and there isn't enough to win the Dakar: it takes grit, consistency and an ability to manage sporting risks.}",
