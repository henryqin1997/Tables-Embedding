            "Campus Safety is quite diligent. They are good at sending out weather alerts as well as emails regarding safety on campus.",
            "I am not completely sure about all Green River has to offer, but I do know that they have Phi Theta Kappa.",
            "I am not too familiar with the clubs here on campus, but I do know they have quite a few clubs that anyone can join.",
            "Green River caters to anyone who finds the community college path the right one for them.",
            "The library is a great place to do research, catch up on homework or meet with group members.",
            "Quite honestly, Green River costs less than a University, but still the price of tuition and fees is a bit steep. Expect some relatively large fees depending on how many credits you are taking each quarter. As far as materials go, books here are expensive, but most you cannot find elsewhere. Green River buys hard cover books and removes the cover so that you cannot resell the books, be aware of this.",
            "Green River offers many intramural sports as well as free exercise classes from time to time. There are community service projects as well as field trips that anyone can take part in. There is always something to do outside of class.",
            "There is a cafeteria in the dining area of the college, but I have not personally eaten there. I have had people tell me that the food is good and the prices are average.",
            "I have not lived on campus, and do not know anyone who has. I have seen campus housing and it looks inviting.",
            "The courses and how well you do in them is really up to you as an individual. You choose what you take, and your success depends on the amount of effort that you put into the course. I would check with other students about instructors however, I have had a couple of bad experiences with poor quality instructors. I would also caution prospective students about online courses. Depending on the course, taking it online can be outstandingly difficult and you can expect your GPA to fall just a bit in most cases.",
            "There are many things I have learned about Green River Community College over the course of my time here. First off, parking can be quite shocking at first. The parking lots fill up incredibly quick, and once they do good luck finding a spot. I recommend getting to campus early to get a spot, or taking the shuttle that the college provides. I also have to foreworn prospective students about the courses themselves at Green River. Do not wait until the last second to register for classes each quarter, classes fill up very quickly and instructors can only take the first few from their waitlist. Also be cautious of the courses that you are taking because Green River does not offer all classes every quarter and some have prerequisites.",
            "Green River Community College is a great place to start your education career. Green River offers a wide range of degrees and certificates to help you achieve your career goals. The College is a welcoming environment that caters to all walks of life."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Someone receiving a DTA (direct-transfer Associate degree) to transfer into a University. In my three years of attending, I never met anyone who was able to even see an academic advisor. You need to check out the universities and get an advisor there. They can tell you what extra courses to take (if any). The DTA will allow you to go straight into the university as a junior. Tips for prospective students If you're someone who needs help in everything, you won't make it here. You probably won't ever see an academic advisor and if you have problems with a teacher, you'll get no help from anyone. Normally, if you're respectful, quiet, but try to get involved in the lecture, everything will work out. Remember that 80% of your grade is actually participation (yes, 80%). And, if you have a grade problem, the teacher will normally give you extra credit work to boost your grade. Bang for the buck Even for a cash student like me, tuition of about $1000 each semester was a good deal. Stay away from the bookstore - they charge six times the price for textbooks than Amazon and college book sites. There is a fee for everything, but they're normally not extravagant.",
