Usage Guidelines The aaa-authorization command allows you to enable or disable AAA authorization when the Call-Home service is running IOS commands for the collection of output for Call-Home messages. To change the AAA authorization username, use the aaa-authorization username command. To change it back to the default username, use the no form of the aaa-authorization usernamecommand. After you enable AAA authorization, you must configure the Call-Home aaa-authorization username as the username on the TACACS server so that the Call-Home service can run the IOS commands. Note When AAA authorization is disabled, you are not required to enter an AAA authorization username to send correct Call-Home messages. Examples The following example shows how AAA authorization is enabled:",
