He made an immediate impact, taking 3 for 23 in 10 overs on his domestic one-day debut against Lankan Cricket Club. He built an outstanding List A record over the next five years, picking up 73 wickets at 18.38 in 45 matches. He was selected in the Sri Lanka A team that toured England in 2011 and took a six-wicket haul while opening the bowling against England Lions. The Sri Lankan selectors immediately took note, asked him to fly back home for the final two ODIs against the touring Australians, and immediately gave him an international debut.
