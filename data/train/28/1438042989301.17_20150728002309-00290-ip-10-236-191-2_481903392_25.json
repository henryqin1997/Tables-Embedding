The cycle number refers to repeated use after elution with 1 M sodium chloride and re-equilibration. Whereas leakage from cell culture broth from hybridoma cell culture was typically in the order of 500 ppm, other cell types gave levels as high as 1000 ppm. An overview on the rate of leakage from differently sourced matrices is given in Table 1; chromatography was performed according to manufacturer' instruction.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40985=Protein A is a cell surface protein found in Staphylococcus aureus. It has the property of binding the Fc region of a mammalian antibody, in particular of IgG class antibodies. Within a given class of antibodies, the affinity slightly varies with regard to species origin and antibody subclass or allotype (reviewed in Surolia, A. et al., 1982, Protein A: Nature's universal antibody', TIBS 7, 74-76; Langone et al., 1982, Protein A of staphylococcus aureus and related immunoglobulin receptors, Advances in Immunology 32:157-252). Protein A can be isolated directly from cultures of S. aureus that are secreting protein A or is more conveniently recombinantly expressed in E. coli (Lofdahl et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:697-701). Its use for purification of antibodies, in particular monoclonal IgG, is amply described in the prior art (e.g. Langone et al., supra; Hjelm et al, 1972; FEBS Lett. 28: 73-76). For use in protein A affinity chromatography, protein A is coupled to a solid matrix such as crosslinked, uncharged agarose (Sepharose, freed from the charged fraction comprised in natural unrefined agarose), trisacryl, crosslinked dextran or silica-based materials. Methods for such are commonly known in the art, e.g. coupling via primary amino functions of the protein to a CNBr-activated matrix. Protein A binds with high affinity and high specificity to the Fc portion of IgG, that is the C?2-Cy3 interface region of IgG as described in Langone et al., 1982, supra. In particular, it binds strongly to the human allotypes or subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and the mouse allotypes or subclasses IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3. Protein A also exhibits an affinity for the Fab region of immunoglobulins that are encoded by the VH gene family, VH III (Sasso et al., 1991, J. Immunol, 61: 3026-3031; Hilson et al., J Exp. Med., 178: 331-336 (1993)). The sequence of the gene coding for protein A revealed two functionally distinct regions (Uhlen et al., J. Biol. Chem., 259: 1695-1702 (1984); Lofdahl et al., Proc. Nutl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 80: 697-701 (1983)). The amino-terminal region contains five highly homologous IgG-binding domains (termed E, D, A, B and C), and the carboxy terminal region anchors the protein to the cell wall and membrane. All five IgG-binding domains of protein A bind to IgG via the Fc region, involving e.g. in human IgG-Fc residues 252-254, 433-435 and 311, as shown for the crystal structure in Deisenhofer et al. (1981, Biochemistry 20: 2361-2370) and in Sauer-Eriksson et al. (1995, Structure 3: 265-278) in case of the B-domain of protein A. The finding of two essentially contiguous main binding sites in the Fc portion has been confirmed in the NMR-solution study of Gouda et al., 1998, Biochemistry 37: 129-136. In principle, each of the IgG-binding domains A to E of protein A is sufficient for binding to the Fc-portion of an IgG. Further, certain human alleles of the VH3 domain family have been found to optionally mediate binding of human Ig by protein A (Ibrahim et al., 1993, J. Immunol. 151:3597-3603; V-region mediated binding of human Ig by protein A). In the context of the present application, in another, separate object of the present invention, everything that has been said applying to Fc-region binding of antibody to protein A applies likewise to the binding of antibodies via such VH3 family protein A-binding allele in case that the Fc-region of such antibody did not allow on itself for high-affinity protein A binding. It may be considered an equivalent embodiment of the principal, Fc-based method of the present invention; the latter is further described in the subsequent sections., 53748=Mammalian cells have large compartments called lysosomes harboring degradating enyzmes which are disrupted upon cell death or harvest. In particular, said cell culture may be a myeloma cell culture such as e.g. NS0 cells (Galfre, G. and Milstein, C. Methods Enzymology, 1981, 73, 3). Myeloma cells are plasmacytoma cells, i.e. cells of lymphoid cell lineage. An exemplary NSO cell line is e.g. cell line ECACC No. 85110503, freely available from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC), Centre for Applied Microbiology & Research, Salisbury, Wiltshire SP4 0JG, United Kingdom. NS0 have been found able to give rise to extremely high product yields, in particular if used for production of recombinant antibodies. In return, NSO cells have been found to give reproducibly rise to much higher levels of contaminant protein A than other host cell types at least with certain protein A affinity chromatography systems employing recombinant, shortened fragments of wild-type protein A which recombinant protein A is possibly single-point attached protein A. An example of such is Streamline\u2122 rProtein A affinity chromatography resin (Amersham Biosciences; essentially thioester single-point attached recombinant protein A as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,750). Levels of about or in excess of 1000 ng contaminant protein A/mg antibody could be obtained with Streamline\u2122 rProtein A affinity columns. The method of the present invention distinguishes from the prior art in efficiently reducing contaminant protein A from such elevated levels to <1 ng/mg antibody in a single, fast purification step, that is with a purification factor of about 1000\ufffd., 111986=The antibody concentration and the contaminant protein A concentration were determined as described above. The level of contaminant protein A in the eluate amounted to 1434 ng/mg antibody before and amounted to 1650 ng/mg antibody after diafiltration. The recovery of antibody based on the titer of the buffer exchanged supernatant solution prior to loading was 81%; the concentration of antibody in the diafiltrated solution was 3.6 mg/ml., 182096=Culturing NS0-GS cells and harvesting B72.3 antibody has been described elsewhere in detail (cp. WO 03/027300 and WO 03/064630 of the same applicant). The producer cell line NS0-6A1 has been deposited under the code \u20186A1-Neo\u2019 on Aug. 30, 2002 under the treaty of Budapest under accession number 02083031 at the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC), Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, Porton Down, Salisbury/Wiltshire SP4 0JG, United Kingdom on behalf of Andy Racher, Lonza Biologicals, 224 Bath Road, Slough, Berkshire, SL1 4DY, United Kingdom; the address given is the company address of Lonza Biologics plc., United Kingdom and the commission has been carried out on commission of and with all rights vested in Lonza Biologics plc. To the extend Mr. Andy Racher, whose current private address is 5 Kingfisher Close, Aldermaston, Reading/Berkshire RG7 4UY, United Kingdom, may be occasionally deemed to be the lawful depositor, it is declared that with regard to such legal interpretation of the deposit documents, Mr. Racher has unreservedly and irrevocably authorised the present applicant, Lonza Biologics plc., to refer to the deposited material in the application and to make it available to the public and has assigned all title in the deposit to the present applicant., 183434=The gene structure of mouse-human chimeric antibody cB72.3 is described in Whittle et al., Protein Eng. 1987, 6: 499-505 and Colcher et al., Cancer Research 49, 1738-1745, (1989). The antibody is also expressed from NS0-6A1-Neo cell line. The purification process for NS0 6A1 antibody (cB72.3) includes two chromatography steps consisting of rmp Protein A Sepharose followed by non-binding Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography., 95342=For final product sample testing, every sample is divided into 2 equal volumes of 500 \u03bcl. One is spiked with the 1000 ng/ml spiking solution, or the 10 \u03bcg/ml solution if appropriate, to give a final protein A content of 10 ng protein A per mg of antibody. The other half is spiked with the same volume of sample buffer; thus the dilution factor of the product sample due to spiking is accounted for. Both types of preparation will be referred to as \u2018spiked sample\u2019 in the following. The sample buffer was made up from 7.51 g Glycine (base), 5.84 g NaCl, 0.5 ml Triton X-100 to a volume of 1 L with deionized or bidestillated water., 33073=Protein A chromatography is widely used in industrial manufacturing of antibodies since allowing for almost complete purification of antibodies, that is usually IgG, in a single step from cell culture supernatants. Protein A affinity columns inevitably are subject to some degree of leakage of ligand from the column upon repeated runs. Partly, this may be due to proteolytic clipping of protein A from the column; in industrial manufacture of antibody for pharmaceutical applications, no protease inhibitor cocktails may be added for regulatory reasons. Unfortunately, this protein A or protein A fragment contaminants retain their affinity for IgG and are difficult to remove from the purified antibody due to ongoing complex formation. Removal of such heterogenous dimeric complexes of two different macromolecules from purified antibody is mandatory since protein A which is a bacterial protein will elicit an unwanted immune response; model complexes formed by adding protein A to monomeric IgG have been reported to activate Fc-bearing leukocytes and the complement system to generate oxidant and anaphylatoxins activity in vitro (Balint et al., Cancer Res. 44, 734, 1984). Balint et al. (supra.) and others (Das et al., 1985, Analyt. Biochem. 145, 27-36) demonstrated that such IgG-Protein complexes can be separated from uncomplexed IgG by gel filtration. Low through-put and loss in antibody yield are the disadvantages of this method., 55453=Further preferred is, alone or in combination with the preceding paragraph, that the antibody that is to be purified by means of protein A affinity chromatography is not treated as to inactivate proteases at or after harvest, more preferably is not in admixture with at least one exogenously supplemented protease inhibitor after harvest. In the present context, a protease inhibitor is any kind of chemical agent (which is not a protease) that is selectively inhibiting proteases whilst it does not chemically modify or do no harm to the tertiary and/or quaternary structure of the product protein, which may be e.g. an antibody; examples of proteinase inhibitors are chelators such as EDTA chelating metal ions important for the activity of metalloproteinases, may be considered such as well as N-[(2S,3R)-3-Amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyryl]-L-leucine Hydrochloride [Bestatin] which is equally active against metalloproteinases. Most preferably, said protease inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of PMSF and specific proteinase inhibiting peptides as described in Laskowski et al., 1980, Protein inhibitors of proteinases, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 49, 593-626. Examples are Leupeptin, Aprotinin for instance., 77039=Examples of suitable buffer salts can be found in Good, N. E. (1986, Biochemistry 5:467-476). E.g. Tris.HCl buffer or a sodium hydrogen phosphate buffer as customarily employed are suitable buffering substances. The concentration of the buffer substance is customarily in the range of e.g. 10-40 mM buffer salt. Amongst potential anion species useful for devising a buffer, those having lower specific strength of anion elution as compared to chloride, which property of low elution strength is approximately inversely correlated with the density of ionic charge and is approximately proportional to the ionic size, are preferred. Empirical comparisons of strength of anionic elution are tabulated in the standard textbooks of biochemistry. More preferably, the buffer substance according to the present invention is a phosphate buffer. Hydrogenphosphate has a low elution strength, in particular if employed at a pH at or below pH 8, and further excels by particularly low chaotropic properties., 39594=An aggregate according to the present invention is understood as the non-covalent association of identical protein entities, preferably an association with an binding equilibrium constant of at least 10 exp-7 M or below (below in sense of tighter binding) which protein may be made up from single protein chains or from covalently bonded, e.g. bonded by means of disulfide bonds, homologous or heterologous multiple polypeptides. The aggregates to which the invention is referring to are soluble in aqueous solution just as are the monomers they are derived from. For instance, a \u2018monomer\u2019 of an IgG antibody according to the present invention relates to the standard tetrameric antibody comprising two identical, glycosylated Heavy and Light chains respectively. An e.g. dimeric aggregate is then the non-specific association of two IgG molecules. Aggregate formation is tightly linked to denaturating influences on the native protein fold and quaternary structure of proteins; aggregation may be e.g. elicited by thermal and pH-induced denaturation of the protein fold. Aggregation rate is hence highly specific for a given protein, depending on the energetic stability of the individual protein fold against a specific challenge (Chiti et al., 2004, Rationalization of the effects of mutations on protein aggregation rates, Nature 424: 805-808)., 64793=The first ion exchanger according to the present invention is an anion exchanger resin; protein A can be bound by both types of resin as described (EP-289 129 B1). The first ion exchanger or anion exchanger can be operated in the column mode at a certain flow rate or in batch operation mode, by submerging the ion exchange resin into the mildly agitated sample solution and further exchanging liquid media by filtration subsequently. According to the present invention and taking into account the pI of a given antibody, it is possible to define suitable conditions of pH and ionic strength for loading the first ion exchanger, which conditions result in retaining the antibody in the flow through whilst the protein A contaminant is bound and thus removed from the antibody. As has been said before, the method according to the present invention allows of faster separation of antibody from contaminant protein A. Examples of functional groups of such first, anion exchanger that are attached to a matrix support are e.g. primary, secondary, and particularly tertiary or quaternary amino groups such as aminoethyl, diethylaminoethyl, trimethylaminoethyl, trimethylaminomethyl and diethyl-(2-hydroxypropyl)-aminoethyl. Suitable chromatographic support matrixes for the anion exchanger are known in the art. Examples are agarose-based resins and beads, dextran beads, polystyrene beads and polystyrene/divinyl-benzene resins. It is further equally possible to use ion exchange membrane absorbers (e.g. Sartobind Q from Sartorius). For the obvious purpose of so allowing of higher flow rates and shorter separation times, the matrix material may a perfusion material which is a further preferred embodiment. It may be made up from perfusion-proficient beaded matrix material (cp. e.g. Afeyan et al., 1991, J. Chromatography, 544, 267.-279), including ceramic matrices, or may be a monolithic perfusion material such as the SepraSorb\ufffd branded fast flow material sold by Sepragen Inc. (Hayward, Calif./U.S.A.). SepraSorb\ufffd was developed specifically as an alternative to the beaded matrices. It is a cross-linked, sponge-like, regenerated cellulose material with a continuous, interconnected, open pore (50-300 micron) structure. This monolithic matrix has readily accessible surfaces on to which the ion exchange functional groups (DEAE, QM, CM & SE) are easily immobilized. Feed stream liquids actually flow perfusion-like through the interconnecting pores of the continuous matrix, as opposed to around the beads as in conventional media. SepraSorb\ufffd provides many advantages over beaded media, in production scale. It can easily accommodate flow rates of 100 ml/min with back pressures rarely exceeding 1 bar (14.5 psi). A monolithic matrix is very easy to handle and to configure avoiding cumbersome and time consuming column packing. The matrix avoids clogging, channeling and is resistant to cracking, hence allows of extended operation time and number of operating cycles.}",
