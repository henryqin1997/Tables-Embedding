            "Feature Information",
            "VCCV provides a control channel that is associated with an ATM pseudowire to perform operations and management functions over the pseudowire. BFD uses the VCCV control channel to detect dataplane failures for pseudowires. In Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)S the BFD control channel over VCCV Support for ATM Pseudowire feature is supported for VCCV type-1 (without an IP/UDP header) only. The following commands were introduced or modified by this feature: bfd-template, debug mpls l2transport vc vccv, interval(BFD), vccv, vccv bfd template, vccv bfd status signaling.",
            "BFD echo mode works with asynchronous BFD. Echo packets are sent by the forwarding engine and forwarded back along the same path in order to perform detection--the BFD session at the other end does not participate in the actual forwarding of the echo packets. The echo function and the forwarding engine are responsible for the detection process, therefore the number of BFD control packets that are sent out between two BFD neighbors is reduced. And since the forwarding engine is testing the forwarding path on the remote (neighbor) system without involving the remote system, there is an opportunity to improve the interpacket delay variance, thereby achieving quicker failure detection times than when using BFD Version 0 with BFD control packets for the BFD session.",
            "This feature supports offloading BFD sessions to ES+ line cards on Cisco 7600 series routers. The following command was introduced or modified: show bfd neighbors .",
            "This feature extends IPv6 support for BFD. The following command was introduced or modified: bfd interval",
            "This feature supports multihop BFD for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. In Cisco IOS Release 15.4(1)S, support was added for the Cisco ASR 901S Series Routers. The following commands were introduced or modified: authentication, bfd map, bfd-template, interval, show bfd neighbors, show bfd neighbor drops.",
            "Unlike dynamic routing protocols, such as OSPF and BGP, static routing has no method of peer discovery. Therefore, when BFD is configured, the reachability of the gateway is completely dependent on the state of the BFD session to the specified neighbor. Unless the BFD session is up, the gateway for the static route is considered unreachable, and therefore the affected routes will not be installed in the appropriate RIB. A single BFD session can be used by an IPv4 static client to track the reachability of next hops through a specific interface. A BFD group can be assigned for a set of BFD-tracked static routes. In Cisco IOS Release 15.4(1)S, support was added for the Cisco ASR 901S Series Routers. The following commands were introduced or modified: ip route static bfd and show ip static route bfd.",
            "This feature supports BFD forwarding on point-to-point IPv4, IPv6, and GRE tunnels. The following commands were introduced or modified: bfd .",
            "This feature supports configuring BFD timers on port channel interface. The following commands were introduced or modified: bfd .",
            "The BFD feature support is extended to be VPN Routing and Forwarding (VRF) aware to provide fast detection of routing protocol failures between provider edge (PE) and customer edge (CE) devices.",
            "The BFD feature is supported on nonbroadcast media interfaces including ATM, POS, serial, and VLAN interfaces. BFD support also extends to ATM, FR, POS, and serial subinterfaces. The bfd interval command must be configured on the interface to initiate BFD monitoring.",
            "This document describes how to enable the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol. BFD is a detection protocol designed to provide fast forwarding path failure detection times for all media types, encapsulations, topologies, and routing protocols. In addition to fast forwarding path failure detection, BFD provides a consistent failure detection method for network administrators. Because the network administrator can use BFD to detect forwarding path failures at a uniform rate, rather than the variable rates for different routing protocol hello mechanisms, network profiling and planning will be easier, and reconvergence time will be consistent and predictable. In Release 12.0(31)S, support was added for the Cisco 12000 series Internet router. In Release 12.0(32)S, support was added for the Cisco 10720 Internet router and IP Services Engine (Engine 3) and Engine 5 shared port adapters (SPAs) and SPA interface processors (SIPs) on the Cisco 12000 series Internet router. In Cisco IOS Release 15.4(1)S, support was added for the Cisco ASR 901S Series Routers.",
            "In Release 12.4(11)T, support for HSRP was added. In Release 12.4(15)T, BFD is supported on the Integrated Services Router (ISR) family of Cisco routers, for example, the Cisco 3800 ISR series routers. In Release 12.2(33)SRC, the number of BFD sessions that can be created has been increased, BFD support has been extended to ATM, FR, POS, and serial subinterfaces, the BFD feature has been extended to be VRF-aware, BFD sessions are placed in an \u201cAdmin Down\u201d state during a planned switchover, and BFD support has been extended to static routing.",
            "BFD support for OSPF can be configured globally on all interfaces or configured selectively on one or more interfaces. When BFD support is configured with IS-IS as a registered protocol with BFD, IS-IS receives forwarding path detection failure messages from BFD. In Cisco IOS Release 15.4(1)S, support was added for the Cisco ASR 901S Series Routers.",
            "BFD support for OSPF can be configured globally on all interfaces or configured selectively on one or more interfaces. When BFD support is configured with OSPF as a registered protocol with BFD, OSPF receives forwarding path detection failure messages from BFD.",
            "Network deployments that use dual RP routers and switches have a graceful restart mechanism to protect forwarding states across a switchover. This feature enables BFD to maintain sessions in a up state across switchovers.",
            "To support SSO, BFD sessions are placed in an \u201cAdmin Down\u201d state during a planned switchover. The BFD configuration is synched from the active to standby processor, and all BFD clients re-register with the BFD process on the standby processor."
