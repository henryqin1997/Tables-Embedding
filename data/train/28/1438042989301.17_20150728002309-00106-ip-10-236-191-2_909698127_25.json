            "None",
            "Usually a fair amount of activities; however, campus does die down a bit during the winter months.",
            "Gonzaga has a tight-knit community and can feel similar to high school. It's a great school for outgoing students. Not for a student who wants to remain anonymous on campus.",
            "Become a member of The Kennel Club and go to as many basketball games as possible.You won't have as much free time during your remaining years as you do during your freshman year. The games are crazy! There is so much school spirit, you'll be captivated.",
            "I enjoyed the BARC's food selection, I thought for college food it was pretty high class food. It really depends on your perspective/pickiness.",
            "The dorm life depends on where you live, definitely try to get in a residence hall within the Limerick Block. Madonna, CM, and Coughlin are the largest and main residence halls for freshman, they'll have the more activities/events than the smaller dorms. That said, if you're shy or prefer a quieter dorm, opt for Crimont, Alliance, Lincoln, Cushing or Dillion. They're usually less social.",
            "Most courses are challenging, relevant, and have go in depth. Professors are competent and friendly, they maintain regular office hours for students who have questions or who would like to chat.",
            "Academic advisors set up your freshman schedule first semester, so you could end up with some easy classes. If so, don't underestimate the second semester of your freshman year. I found my intended easy classes, to be more challenging than I expected.",
            "Gonzaga is academically rigorous, community orientated, and full of basketball fanatics. Students genuinely care about one another. As a freshman, you'll be welcomed into the Zag family and you will be supported by one another throughout your four years together and life hereafter."

From tenting for basketball games to volunteering with the clubs on campus there are soo many things to do. Also downtown Spokane is just a quick walk and there is ice skating, the annual Bloomsday run in May, different restaurants and shops too., 267910=TENTING! Tenting is a must do if you go to Gonzaga. What it is is when there is a big men's basketball game the Kennel Club (people that help distribute tickets) sends out a text at about 12:15 and it says where the location of them is so that you can get a number. This number is the tent that you get. If you get in the top 5 tents that guarantees you front row seats. The whole thing is an EXPERIENCE! And one that is on every zag's undergraduate bucket list., 168357=I want to go to this school in the fall of 2013 because of what I've researched and what people who have seen the campus told me. Its a wonderful school, beautiful campus and great community service opportunities- which i love to do. Even though the school is expensive and some of the reviewers I'm reading is bad and not encouraging, that will not stop me from attending the college I'm interested in., 261230=Visit the campus during the months of January, February, or March. If you love the campus then, you will love it most of the time. Those months are the gloomy months and can bring down moods if you come from a place with warmer weather like I did.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Gonzaga is an expensive investment but worth it. The students actually care about their education and the teachers make sure their students are successful by providing the tools necessary to succeed. Do not be afraid to apply to Gonzaga because of the cost. I was awarded grants, and scholarships that pretty much took care of 90% of my cost to go to this amazing school. Gonzaga will make sure that your financial needs are met, and remember that school is an investment. Gonzaga is worth the money. Am enjoying being here Gonzaga is full of spirit and love. Being a mid year transfer student was hard because everyone knew the great spots to eat and meet and then there was me, confused about everything, but not for long. The Zag students could sense when someone was lost or confused and countless time on my first week of school people willingly came up to me to offer me directions and help me locate classes and buildings. This friendliness was refreshing and made this school enjoyable because of the love that radiates from the teachers and students. Am learning a lot I transferred for University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho to go to a more demanding school like",
