Federal policy requires fixing rates for the life of the award at rates in effect (including negotiated provisional rates that will be revised when the federal rates are negotiated) at the time of the award. See OSP's policy Implementation of \"Fixed Rate\" Requirements of A-21 . Most non-federal awards are established at MIT billing rates which change each FY to the current FY\u0092s federal negotiated rates. However, both federal and nonfederal sponsors occasionally specify a rate and/or base which differs from those which would normally be applied under federal and/or Institute policies.}",
