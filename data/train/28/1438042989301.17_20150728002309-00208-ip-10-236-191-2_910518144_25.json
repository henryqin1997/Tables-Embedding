            "Campus safety is one aspect that is honestly the best. There is an on campus police station, fire department, and ambulance for student need. There a campus police always around to lend a helping hand to any student on campus. Since there are policemen on campus, it makes it much easier, and it makes students feel safe.",
            "Greek life is a very popular part of the university. The Greek Organizations on campus are extremely friendly, and they participate in a lot of community service throughout school terms. They are very good role modles to younger students.",
            "There are so many clubs and organizations on campus it is hard to keep track of them all. New students will not have a hard time finding a club to get involved in.",
            "Traditionally, Alcorn is known for their awesome band and every year during the band camp and tryouts the band marches around the campus' Horseshoe every night after dusk. The horseshoe is just the main road on campus that leads to most buildings on campus.",
            "The bang for your buck is fairly decent! Like many universities, everything is not as cheap as students would like, but in our case the prices are not always steep. Saving should be the main priority in this case.",
            "For fun on campus, there are a huge amount of social events that happen regularly for students to attend at their leisure,and there are also sporting events throughout the year. In addition, there is a small on campus bowling alley, pool hall, and recreation space for students on campus.",
            "The University has an awesome dining facility that meets every one's health needs and wants. There are a couple of fast food restaurants on campus as well. In the cafeteria students have a wide variety of options to choose from. The choices cater to everyone including vegetarians.",
            "The dormitories are beautiful and very well kept. In addition to the appearance of the dormitories, each dorm has separate programs for residents to participate in during their free time to help everyone meet other students.",
            "University academics are challenging, but when you are very dedicated it can become easier.",
            "Prospective students should take the location of the university into consideration because it is in an isolated area. They should be open minded and friendly as well as dedicated to class.",
            "Alcorn State is a University that makes you feel comfortable with its calming educational environment. The campus is lively and filled with fun personalities. The Professors really care, and they want to make sure that you learn."

Tips for prospective students If you expect to go to a school in the city and party all the time do not come to Alcorn. If you expect to just party do not come to Alcorn because education comes first and the administrators will not mind sending you home because you flunked out. Bang for the buck Alcorn does not have the best dorms, buildings, etc., but it is a great school. Am enjoying being here",
