    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{47145=Still other useful sunscreens are those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,370, to Sabatelli, issued Jun. 26, 1990; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,999,186, to Sabatelli et al., issued Mar. 12, 1991; these two references are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. The sunscreening actives disclosed therein have, in a single molecule, two distinct chromophore moieties which exhibit different ultra-violet radiation absorption spectra. One of the chromophore moieties absorbs pre-dominantly in the UVB radiation range and the other absorbs strongly in the UVA radiation range. These sunscreening actives provide higher efficacy, broader UV absorption, lower skin penetration and longer lasting efficacy relative to conventional sunscreens. Especially preferred examples of these sunscreens include those selected from the group consisting of 4-N,N-(2-ethylhexyl)methylaminobenzoic acid ester of 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone, 4-N,N-(2-ethylhexyl)methylaminobenzoic acid ester with 4-hydroxydibenzoylmethane, 4-N,N-(2-ethylhexyl)methylaminobenzoic acid ester of 2-hydroxy-4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)benzophenone, 4-N,N-(2-ethylhexyl)-methylaminobenzoic acid ester of 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)dibenzoylmethane, and mixtures thereof., 33413=Said carriers can be present from about 5 to 99% by weight of the compositions of the present invention, more preferably from about 50 to about 99% by weight, and most preferably from about 85 to 95% by weight. The carrier can be in a wide variety of forms. For example, emulsion carriers, including, but not limited to, oil-in-water, water-in-oil, water-in-oil-in-water, and oil-in-water-in-silicone emulsions, are useful herein. These emulsions can cover a broad range of viscosities, e.g, from about 100 cps to about 200,000 cps. These emulsions can also be delivered in the form of sprays using either mechanical pump containers or pressurized aerosol containers using conventional propellants. These carriers can also be delivered in the form of a mousse. Other suitable topical carriers include anhydrous liquid solvents such as oils, alcohols, and silicones (e.g., mineral oil, ethanol, isopropanol, dimethicone, cyclomethicone, and the like); aqueous-based single phase liquid solvents (e.g., hydro-alcoholic solvent systems): and thickened versions of these anhydrous and aqueous-based single phase solvents (e.g., where the viscosity of the solvent has been increased to form a solid or semi-solid by the addition of appropriate gums, resins, waxes, polymers, salts, and the like). Examples of topical carrier systems useful in the present invention are described in the following four references all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety: \u201cSun Products Formulary\u201d Cosmetics & Toiletries, vol. 105, pp. 122-139 (December 1990); \u201cSun Products Formulary\u201d, Cosmetics & Toiletries, vol. 102, pp. 117-136 (March 1987); U.S. Pat. No. 4,960,764 to Figueroa et al., issued Oct. 2, 1990; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,254,105 to Fukuda et al., issued Mar. 3, 1981., 42501=Useful pharmaceutical actives in the compositions of the present invention include anti-acne actives. Anti-acne actives preferred for use in the present invention include the keratolytics such as salicylic acid, sulfur, lactic acid, glycolic, pyruvic acid, urea, resorcinol, and N-acetylcysteine; retinoids such as retinoic acid and its derivatives (e.g., cis and trans); antibiotics and antimicrobials such as benzoyl peroxide, octopirox, erythromycin, zinc, tetracyclin, triclosan, azelaic acid and its derivatives, phenoxy ethanol and phenoxy proponol, ethylacetate, clindamycin and meclocycline; sebostats such as flavinoids; alpha and beta hydroxy acids; and bile salts such as scymnol sulfate and its derivatives, deoxycholate, and cholate. Preferred for use herein is salicylic acid. Useful pharmaceutical actives in the compositions of the present invention include analgesic actives. Analgesic actives suitable for use in the present compositions include salicylic acid derivatives such as methyl salicylate, species and derivatives of the genus capsicum such as capsaicin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). The NSAIDS can be selected from the following categories: propionic acid derivatives; acetic acid derivatives; fenamic acid derivatives; biphenylcarboxylic acid derivatives; and oxicams. All of these NSAIDS are fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,985,459 to Sunshine et al., issued Jan. 15, 1991, incorporated by reference herein. Most preferred are the propionic NSAIDS including but not limited to aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, benoxaprofen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, fenbufen, ketoprofen, indoprofen, pirprofen, carprofen, oxaprozin, pranoprofen, miroprofen, tioxaprofen, suprofen, alminoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, fluprofen and bucloxic acid.
