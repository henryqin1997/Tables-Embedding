            "Ohio Wesleyan does a fantastic job at making everyone feel safe. Public Safety is always around should you ever have a problem and the Delaware Police are nearby as well.",
            "Greek life is pretty big on campus. The sororities and fraternities here are so nice and welcoming though, that even if you aren't part of Greek life, it is still possible to fit in and find a solid friend group.",
            "There are countless clubs and activities here on campus that can allow you to get involved in whatever you would like!",
            "One of the great things about OWU is that multiple kinds of people can fit in easily here. Whether you are a jock, a thespian, a writer, a scientist, you can find a place at Ohio Wesleyan.",
            "Day on the Jay is one of the most fun days on campus. They have one in the fall and one in the spring and the university brings in huge inflatables, free food, music. It's an awesome day for everyone on campus.",
            "Ohio Wesleyan is an extremely expensive school to attend. They do have scholarships available but more scholarships is always a good thing. However, the learning atmosphere and college life that is possible at OWU is great, just a little pricey.",
            "Columbus and Polaris Shopping Mall are both within a half hour of Ohio Wesleyan. Downtown Delaware has some fun stuff to do. If you are willing to explore and be creative it is possible to have fun here in Delaware.",
            "While options are sort of limited, the food is pretty average here. A bonus though is the off campus food points that we get, I just wish that they gave us more of them.",
            "Dorm life here is awesome. There are many different options for a smaller school that allow you to sort of pick and choose the kind of atmosphere that you want to live in.",
            "There are a variety of courses offered here, all with different levels of difficulty. However, the university does a great job in providing the resources necessary to exceed and do well here.",
            "Don't be afraid to seize the countless opportunities that are presented to you at Ohio Wesleyan. Getting involved is probably one of the best things you can do once you get to college.",
            "While the university is a bit small, the learning atmosphere created at OWU is astounding. You can reach any goal you may have in an atmosphere that promotes learning and growth. If a liberal arts education is something you are looking for, Ohio Wesleyan is one of the best schools for it."

There are parties constantly, slamming doors, mysterious clouds of smoke in the stairwell that make you lightheaded. If you are there for studies at all, just don't do it. My personal recommendation is Smith East or West. The dining hall is in the basement, the suites are well laid out, and there's air conditioning - a big plus for August and April. Also, I don't know about frats, but the sororities seem like a waste to me. There are dances and mixers, but other than that, it's just cupcake icing and other stuff for recruits. I'm friends with quite a few sorority girls without even being in a sorority, so I don't really recommend it. If you want, I don't think it'd be bad, I just don't see the point in spending the money for it., 172365=There is the President's Ball in December, right before finals start. It's a really great dance with the Jazz Band playing for a while and then the DJs take over. What really makes it special is that it's held in the science building. Out science building is really new and has this huge atrium on the ground floor - perfect for dancing. It's really special and always tons of fun. President Rock Jones even comes and dances with us for a while!, 6889=Like every campus, there are the people you want to avoid, but there's a lot fewer of them at OWU than there were at my high school, so I really can't complain. The dorms are fantastic, the food is pretty good; Smith dining can get a bit repetetive, but whatever it is, it's usually good - that's more than I can say for my mom's cooking! The professors are, for the most part, very laid back and welcoming. Whatever you do, you have to take HMCL 122 with Elias - he's hysterical! I was taking his course the same semester as Calculus, and I loved going to his class - even at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays - just for the laughs. The excellent readings, discussions, and jokes kept me sane while I was biting my nails over integrals and derivatives., 49796=Ohio Wesleyan is situated in quaint, rural mid-west environment with a 10:1 student to faculty ratio, making it an awesome place to learn first-hand from a very talented and dedicated group of academics. It offers a broad range of student activities, ranging from special-interest clubs to foreign study programs to highly-competitive Division 3 athletics. For the student seeking a high-quality education without the distractions of a large city, I strongly recommend visiting OWU in Delaware, OH., 12193=Academics! Those who major in: Economics, accounting, or management, english, statistics, and several sciences. How many schools with 1800 students have a dorm dedicated to econ/management students and a scanning electron microscope in the science center?, 180155=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot During my freshman year, I knocked out a lot of my diversity course requirements: Computer Science, Mathematics, Foreign Language, Electives, etc. I'm an English Major, so Computer Science and Mathematics were a bit tough for me. Mainly Calculus. But at OWU, the professors expect you to have common sense. In the introductory courses, it really is introductory - they don't expect you to know everything ahead of time, which is really helpful. I highly recommend CS 103 with Zaring - he's an awesome professor. But, as easy as they make it for students learning the field from nil, I learned a lot over the past two semesters. Not to mention my musical skills that have grown exponentially over the past year. I don't come from a big school district with an overly fancy music department with correlating budget, so I was always the top player. When I got to OWU, Dr. Griffin had those same expectations, and more. He challenged me to improve, not just for the group, but for myself.
