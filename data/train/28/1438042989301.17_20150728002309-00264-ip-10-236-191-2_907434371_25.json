K is a constant coefficient with the initial value 3. A 4-core server will have 12 feeding sessions, which means that the content processing component can process 12 documents in parallel. You can change the value of K by setting the NumberOfCssFeedersPerCPUForRegularCrawl property of the Search Service Application. SharePoint 2013 limits the value of N upward to 12, even if a server has more than 12 physical cores. Therefore a 16-core server will have N*K = 12 * 3 = 36 feeding sessions., 146824=The following table lists the recommended guidelines for instances of Visio Services in SharePoint Server 2013., 151298=The SharePoint Web Analytics service has been deprecated in SharePoint Server 2013., 45633=With 200GB per content database, and 500 content databases per farm, SharePoint Server 2013 supports 100TB of data per farm., 20153=Summary: Learn about the tested performance and capacity limits of SharePoint Server 2013 and how limits relate to acceptable performance., 47941=The complexity of customizations and configurations on SharePoint Server 2013 may necessitate refactoring (or splitting) of data into multiple content databases. Seek advice from a skilled professional architect and perform testing to determine the optimum content database size for your implementation. Examples of complexity may include custom code deployments, use of more than 20 columns in property promotion, or features listed as not to be used in the over 4 TB section below., 169032=Date: 12/31/2149, 121897=For SharePoint Foundation 2013 the maximum number of indexed items is 2 million items per index partition., 20079=Topic Last Modified: 2015-03-06, 50805=SharePoint Server 2013 sites must be based on Document Center or Records Center site templates., 28387=An example of a boundary is the 2 GB document size limit; you cannot configure SharePoint Server 2013 to store documents that are larger than 2 GB. This is a built-in absolute value, and cannot be exceeded by design., 69945=A scope is the security boundary for a securable object and any of its children that do not have a separate security boundary defined. A scope contains an Access Control List (ACL), but unlike NTFS ACLs, a scope can include security principals that are specific to SharePoint Server 2013. The members of an ACL for a scope can include Windows users, user accounts other than Windows users (such as forms-based accounts), Active Directory groups, or SharePoint groups., 168398=The following table lists the recommended guidelines for Project Server.

Adding servers to the installation might not increase the capacity limits of the objects that are listed in the tables in the Limits and boundaries section later in this topic. On the other hand, adding server computers increases the throughput of a server farm, which might be necessary to achieve acceptable performance with many objects. In some cases, the requirements for high numbers of objects in a solution might require more servers in the farm., 55509=From the time that SharePoint Server 2013 requests a BLOB, until it receives the first byte from the NAS, 95% of the time no more than 40 milliseconds can pass., 105003=The word breaker only considers the first 1000 characters of a token for splitting, it ignores any remaining characters., 100398=You can change the default limit for the maximum document size. Do this by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets to change the Search service application property MaxDownLoadSize or MaxDownloadSizeExcel. MaxDownLoadSize doesn't impact the maximum size for Excel documents. Enter the value in megabytes. The maximum value for the maximum document size is 1024 MB, also for Excel documents., 94363=For SharePoint Foundation 2013 the maximum number of index components per Search service application is one, so the maximum number of index replicas per Search service application is limited to one., 31721=In SharePoint Server 2013, thresholds and supported limits are established through testing and observation of farm behavior under increasing loads up to the point where farm services and operations reach their effective operational limits. Some farm services and components can support a higher load than others so that in some cases you must assign a limit value based on an average of several factors., 47428=Requirements for backup and restore may not be met by the native SharePoint Server 2013 backup for content databases larger than 200 GB. It is recommended to evaluate and test SharePoint Server 2013 backup and alternative backup solutions to determine the best solution for your specific environment., 48462=Refactoring of site collections allows for scale out of a SharePoint Server 2013 implementation across multiple content databases. This permits SharePoint Server 2013 implementations to scale indefinitely. This refactoring will be easier and faster when content databases are less than 200 GB., 52767=The largest number of items per content database that has been tested on SharePoint Server 2013 is 60 million items, including documents and list items. If you plan to store more than 60 million items in SharePoint Server 2013, you must deploy multiple content databases., 85770=SharePoint Server 2013 enables you to add users or Active Directory groups to a SharePoint group., 55370=When SharePoint Server 2013 is configured to use RBS, and the BLOBs reside on NAS storage, consider the following supported limit., 30693=Thresholds and supported limits guidelines are determined by performance. In other words, you can exceed the default values of the limits, but as you increase the limit value, farm performance and the effective value of other limits may be affected. Many limits in SharePoint Server 2013 can be changed, but it is important to understand how changing a given limit affects other parts of the farm., 71122=SharePoint Server 2013 data is stored in SQL Server tables. To allow for the maximum number of possible columns in a SharePoint list, SharePoint Server 2013 will create several rows in the database when data will not fit on a single row. This is called row wrapping., 25776=This article contains information to help you understand the tested performance and capacity limits of SharePoint Server 2013, and offers guidelines for how limits relate to acceptable performance. Use the information in this article to determine whether your planned deployment falls within acceptable performance and capacity limits, and to appropriately configure limits in your environment., 93428=For SharePoint Foundation 2013, the maximum number of index components per Search service application is one, so the maximum number of index partitions per Search service application is limited to one., 20308=This article describes software boundaries and limits of SharePoint Server 2013. These include the following:, 38338=This section provides limits sorted by the logical hierarchy of a SharePoint Server 2013 farm., 92763=For SharePoint Foundation 2013, this limit is one index component per Search service application and cannot be exceeded., 51989=For more information about large-scale document repositories, see Estimate performance and capacity requirements for large scale document repositories in SharePoint Server 2010, and the Typical large-scale content management scenarios section of the article Enterprise content storage planning (SharePoint Server 2010)., 27818=In SharePoint Server 2013, there are certain limits that are by design and cannot be exceeded, and other limits that are set to default values that may be changed by the farm administrator. There are also certain limits that are not represented by a configurable value, such as the number of site collections per web application., 110467=1000}",
