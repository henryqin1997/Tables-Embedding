    "textBeforeTable": "Tier One - Basic Form The Fairy's represents the most traditional form of evolution, with four tiers worth of chart and eight possible branches starting from tier one to tier four. Because the learned abilities carry over from one fairy form to the next, it's possible to end up with a fully evolved fairy that has to its name any number of combinations of spells and other helpful abilities. The fairies' stat effect: A Fairy's mere presence on the field of battle will precipitate a boost to Hector's luck. Chart Analysis Evolution Chart Fairy Type \u00a0 Potential Skill: This has two possible meanings: (1) A potential skill is any ability that can be carried over from a previous evolution (remember that you can miss gaining an ability, in which case the I.D. in a higher tier will never learn it--thus the \"potential\" label). Or (2) an ability that an I.D. may or may not have according to your path to its evolution. For instance: A fully evolved Fairy in the middle might have abilities left over from either the tier-three Fairy in the center or the one to its side.",
