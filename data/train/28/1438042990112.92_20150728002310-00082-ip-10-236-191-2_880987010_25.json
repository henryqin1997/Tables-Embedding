            "For fun you can join an extracurricular activity like dance, basketball, baseball, or tennis. you may even show your school spirit by attending sporting events. If you like to workout for fun, the weight room there is fully functional to attending students.",
            "The cafeteria food is very good. The prices are reasonable as well.",
            "Lehman curriculum isn't that rigorous due to the fact that it is mainly geared to liberal arts education.",
            "Stay focused. It is very easy to fall off track due to the wide variety of extracurricular activities as well as the layout of the campus. many students, in my experience, have fallen into the cutting class phase because some rather hang out on campus rather than go to class. Don't fall into into that pattern.",
            "Lehman College has a beautiful campus with a diverse race of students. Its location in the Bronx makes it east to find. They have a wide variety of sports and many extracurricular activities and club for you to join. Campus is quite quiet filled with studeents who are focused on their studies. Overall a great school."

One would never think to expect how much Lehman College has to offer in terms of academics and extracurricular activities. Hopefully, I will travel to Greece next summer and be a part of an archeology course as an exchange student in July 2013., 192256=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 62582=The cost of a college credit at Lehman College for an undergraduate and matriculated New York resident is $230. My tuition cost for the fall of 2012 is $2,904., 137560=The campus just built and opened in Spring 2013 the new Science Hall building. It is a research facility dedicated to fill the need for American students to advance in science, technology and math. Lectures and labs also take place there. Other locations that are interesting on campus is the APEX gym and the 3 cafeterias on campus that provide a variety of food and also Starbucks at a discounted price. The Apex gym location was also used to house many of the Hurricane Sandy victims. They sheltered those that were unfortunate until they were able to get back on their feet.}",
