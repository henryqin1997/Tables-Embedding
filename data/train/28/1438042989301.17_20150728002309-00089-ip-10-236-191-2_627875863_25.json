The source of the hospitalization data was the 1988 national morbidity file, which records all public hospital discharges in New Zealand. Motorcyclists were identified by E-code and text description of cause (which New Zealand uses to supplement E-codes). AIS scores were assigned using the ICDMAP program, based on the primary injury diagnosis. Inpatient costs were extrapolated from costs for patients at the Dunedin Public Hospital for April 1988 through March 1990 (two years)., 49699=Study Population.

Annual crash and injury incidence were estimated using Crashworthiness Data System (1988-1991), National Automotive Sampling System (1982-1986), General Estimates System (1992-1993), and Fatality Analysis Reporting System (1993) data. Costs were computed based on restraint use, body region, and threat-to-life severity of the injury. Costs estimated included medically related costs, emergency services, property damage, lost productivity, and quality of life. Costs were then allocated between vehicle types using the different allocation methods in order to answer comparative safety questions. The cost allocation methods are:, 90996=For Louisiana, the authors often compared 1981 with 1987, rather than with 1982. Any changes resulting from the helmet law should have occurred relatively soon after the law took effect. Stretching out the comparison period increases the likelihood of contamination by other influences. Still, the authors sometimes used 1982, giving the appearance of choosing the comparison year that gave the strongest result., 67570=Abstract Objective. To analyze the effect of California\u0092s motorcycle helmet law, which took effect in 1992, on injury costs., 6452=There was a significant linear increase in the fatality rate between 1978 and 1988 but no comparable trend in hospitalizations. The estimated inpatient cost for all motorcycle crashes in 1988 was NZ$13,485,628. Traffic crashes represented 92 percent of the total cost. Traffic collision crashes were approximately twice as expensive as traffic noncollision crashes ($6,942 vs. $3,342), and they accounted for 61 percent of the total costs., 91418=The authors attributed the falling collision rate in Louisiana to the helmet law. They offer no theoretical reason why this should be so. Moreover, there was no reduction in the first year after the law took effect; the entire reduction took place in subsequent years. It appears that other factors were at work in the state after 1982, reducing the collision rate., 71636=Some critics of California\u0092s helmet law have attributed the fall in injury rates after passage of the law to the decline in motorcycle registrations. But Max et al. show calculations demonstrating that injury rates fell much faster than registrations between 1991 and 1992., 29264=Note During most of the study period, Connecticut had no helmet law. In mid-1989, a law took effect requiring riders under 18 to wear helmets., 13249=Billheimer, J.W. (1998). Evaluation of California motorcyclist safety program.Transportation Research Record 1640, 100-109., 203440=Table 3 in the paper, which follows, shows mean HRQL scores by year post-injury and Glascow Outcome Score. For most intermediate years, the scores shown are based on recall in 1995. The number of responses varies by year, so the table entries are not a time series for a consistent set of respondents. For example the lower HRQL score for year 4 than year 3 among victims with Glascow Outcome Scores of 4 at discharge does not mean that some victims\u0092 condition worsened in this time period. Rather, it stems from 1) the small sample size and 2) instability of cell sizes resulting from their sampling technique, which includes results from a year earlier only if the victim can remember his HRQL a year earlier. Among the GOS=4 victims interviewed, there might have been few that were three years post-recovery, and those four years post-recovery could not remember their HRQL of a year earlier (which would also have been included in that cell if they had remembered)., 131132=Study Population. The study included all persons involved in police-reported crashes in the participating states (HI, ME, MO, NY, PA, UT, and WI) during a one-year study period (1990 for HI and MO; 1992 for NY; and 1991 for the other states). The study captured those who were injured or who died and those who were not injured. Utah was excluded from the motorcycle portion of the study because its crash reports do not distinguish between unhelmeted motorcyclists and those whose helmet use was unknown. In three states with universal helmet legislation (MO, NY, and PA, which together generated 61 percent of the cases), 96 percent of crash-involved motorcyclists were wearing helmets. In the other three states, without such a law (HI, ME, and WI), the helmet-use rate was only 34 percent. Overall, 72 percent of the motorcyclists in this study were helmeted., 85453=Study Populations, Data, & Methods. Texas. The authors selected 99 patients transported from the scenes of motorcycle crashes by the Bexar County EMS from September 1986 to December 1987 (16 months). Eight other subjects were dropped because of unknown helmet use, or because they were transferred to or from the Medical Center Hospital, from which some data were not available. A medical student assigned AIS scores to each patient. To look at rates of fatality, hospitalization, injury, and helmet use, 6,600 Texas motorcycle collisions from the same time frame were examined., 34240=Weaknesses As acknowledged by the authors, these 51 open fracture cases cannot be considered a representative sample of motorcycle injuries. Open fractures account for only about a third of all motorcycle injuries, and they tend to be significantly more serious than non-fractures or closed fractures.The article, which is based on data from 1980-83, is quite dated. The 21.2-day average length of stay is extremely high; in 1991, the average length of stay for hospital-admitted motorcycle injuries was just 7.9 days. The longer length of stay represents the combined effects of 1) the sample\u0092s bias towards more severe injuries and 2) the less cost-conscious medical regime of the earlier period. It would be very difficult to generalize these results., 191508=Data & Methods. Information on injury severity, length of treatment, hospital charges, discharge status, and insurance status for 706 motorcycle operators and 68 passengers was compared with information on 8,961 other roadway crash victims and 15,547 non-roadway trauma victims - all identified by ICD-9 E-code - treated at 8 North Carolina trauma centers during the period October 1987-June 1990. For 309 motorcycle cases, the trauma center records were matched to the state motor vehicle crash and licensed driver history files to obtain additional information concerning the injured motorcyclist, including police-reported helmet use and license status., 87918=Results. After repeal of the helmet law, the LA user rate dropped from 97 percent to 50 percent. With reinstatement, the user rate rose to 95 percent. Average hospital stay for helmeted (H) riders is 5.8, non-helmeted (NH) 11.8. Fatality rate per 1,000 motorcycle registrations is 6.2 NH, 1.6 H. Changes effected through LA helmet legislation: fatality rate was 1.17 (1981), falling to 0.44 (1987) with legislation (62 percent decrease); fatality rate per 1,000 crashes fell 28 percent, from 42.68 NH to 30.81 H; injury rate dropped from 84 percent of crashes to 73 percent; and the number of critical injuries was reduced by 44 percent (1981 to 1987). Risk of head injury: NH 2.07>H. Risk of fatality: NH 1.44>H. Crash rate is less with helmet legislation than without (19 percent KS, 48 percent LA)., 93501=Miller, T.R. (1994). Costs of safety belt and motorcycle helmet nonuse. Testimony before the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, House Committee on Public Works and Transportation, hearing on Designating the National Highway System, as required by the Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), March 3, 1994., 68508=San Diego County cost data, 1991-93. Data on costs of ambulance transport, emergency air transport, ED visits, and follow-up ambulatory care visits were obtained from billing records. These costs were adjusted downwards by the ratio of California/San Diego per diem hospital costs., 122197=Clinical Injury Study. Much of the analysis, particularly the breakdowns by body region and injury type (Table 4), is based on small samples, and the results cannot be considered significant. The clearest evidence of the efficacy of helmets would come from a demonstration of a reduction in the rate of serious head injuries. But the conclusion that \u0093serious head injuries decreased 22 percent,\u0094 based on a total of 34 cases over the two years, is particularly sensitive to sample size; a single additional head injury in 1989 would have cut this decrease by half. Given the small population, the secular decline in all motorcycle riding figures, and the decrease in unlicensed driving, a one-year post-law sample consisting of 92 injuries and 38 hospitalizations limits the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn., 27117=Data & Methods.

(The three data sources were not linked.) In the first two datasets, motorcycle cases were identified by E-code. Hospitals that E-code less than 70 percent of injury discharges were dropped. The resulting E-coded subsample included only 36 percent of Connecticut\u0092s injury discharges, so counts were divided by 0.36 to create statewide estimates., 129781=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

It contains detailed information, collected with the cooperation of the emergency services system, on injuries to each rider and the characteristics of each crash.

Crash trends: Historical data on motorcycle crashes, registrations, and licensing for 1977-1995 (10 years before and 9 years after implementation of CMSP), broken down by number, severity, and age, were used to plot simple graphs to show trends in annual numbers of crashes, fatalities per registered motorcycle, and crashes per licensed rider for California. California statistics were also compared with national figures for the same period., 243126=Abstract Background. In 1976 the U.S. Congress removed the threat of withdrawal of certain highway funds from states that failed to enact motorcycle helmet laws. Since then, over half the states have either repealed or weakened these laws. Most researchers in the field agree that this has led to a significant increase in injuries and fatalities among motorcyclists involved in crashes. Potential limitations of many of the studies on which these conclusions are based include the facts that fatalities can result from injuries to parts of the body not protected by helmets and that other factors, such as speed and alcohol use, are not taken into account, usually because of lack of data. The former will result in a loss of power and the latter in the introduction of bias., 7465=The exchange rate in 1988 was New Zealand $1 = U.S. $0.6556., 67925=Data & Methods. California state hospital discharge data, 1991-93. Motorcycle injuries (11,163) were selected by ICD-9 E-code. Cases were classified by admission date. Costs were calculated from charges using hospital-specific cost/charge ratios. Professional fees were estimated as 25 percent of hospital costs. Transfers were identified by discharge and admission dates, discharge disposition, and admission source. Unique record-linkage number were used to link readmissions, rehabilitation, and (hospital-based) nursing home care., 14624=Matched-pair analysis: On-site interviewers went to motorcyclist hang-outs in search of riders. They assembled profiles identifying riders by age, sex, years riding, miles ridden per year, and primary purpose of riding (commuting, recreation, etc.). Over five years, beginning in late 1989, interviews with 16,000 untrained motorcyclists were obtained, resulting in 2,351 pairs of motorcyclists matched by the five key factors listed above. Of these pairs, 1,139 included a rider taking the basic 16-hour course and the other 1,182 included a rider taking the 8-hour experienced rider course (ERC). The initial profiling was followed up by telephone surveys of the participants. Key methods distinguishing this study from similar previous studies were 1) to differentiate between pairs of riders who had previously ridden more than 500 miles (524 pairs) and those who had not (615 pairs), and 2) executing the first follow-up survey six months after the training course instead of waiting a full year. Aggregate crash counts and crash rates were then compared separately for those who had previously ridden 500 miles and those who had not, at the six-month, one-year, and two-year marks., 13419=Abstract Purpose & Study Population. The California Motorcyclist Safety Program (CMSP) is a legislatively mandated, statewide program that has trained more than 100,000 motorcyclists in the 10 years since its implementation in July 1987. The program is mandatory for riders under 21 seeking a California motorcycle license. The current evaluation traces motorcycle crash trends before and after the formation of the CMSP, compares crash trends in California with those in the remainder of the United States, and analyzes the riding records of matched pairs of 2,351 trained and untrained Southern California riders., 43264=Interesting Reference \u0093In 1982, treatment for a spinal cord injury at the Phoenix Regional Spinal Cord Injury Center averaged $75,300 for a quadriplegic requiring an average stay of 184 days.\u0094 (Young, Burns, Bowen, & McCutchen. (1982). Spinal Cord Injury Statistics. Phoenix, AZ, Good Samaritan Medical Center, p. 33.), 69876=Results. Total medical care costs for motorcycle injuries were $35 million less in 1993 than in 1991, a reduction of 35 percent. Costs decreased for all payer categories, and 73 percent of the reduced hospitalization costs were attributable to reduced costs for patients with head injuries. Head injuries also accounted for a disproportionate share of the reduction in the rate (60 percent) of hospitalized injuries per 100,000 motorcyclists. Initial hospital costs for patients with head injuries averaged $18,527, compared with $10,350 for patients without head injuries. (See table 1, below, for more results.), 181414=Questions Was a helmet law in effect in North Carolina during the period under study (1987-90)? Probably not, based on the helmet use rates, but the legal context of motorcycling in the state should be discussed., 98523=Corrections There are two corrections to the 1998 paper: The WTP cost for fatalities in Table 1 ($2,716) should read \u0093$2,716,000.\u0094 On page 85, in the \u0093Table 4\u0094 paragraph, the second-to-last sentence reads: \u0093Other single vehicle truck injuries in multi-vehicle crashes may be more severe.\u0094 The word \u0093vehicle\u0094 should be removed, so that it reads, \u0093Other single truck injuries . . .\u0094, 102998=Summary Tables of 1993 Motorcycle Crash Costs from articles by Miller et al. (all costs in September 1995 dollars), 88770=The medical costs (LA 1981-1987) decreased 48.8 percent. Length of stay decreased 37 percent. The major impact hospital stay >20 days: 80 percent decline. Cost of long-term disability >30 days: 81.2 percent decrease (LA). Average disability was 26.7 days H vs. 51.1 days NH (KS); 25.5 percent H required hospitalization vs. 41.6 percent NH. Medical costs: NH 306 percent>H (KS). In Bexar Co., only 18 percent of NH riders\u0092 charges had been paid, compared with 59 percent of H riders\u0092. In LA, short-term disability costs per case fell from $18,314 in 1981 to $17,301 in 1982, while average long-term (>30 days) disability costs fell from $29,800 to $5,600 in the same period. In 1989 dollars, $120.8 million of additional medical care and rehabilitation expenses per year were due directly to non-use of helmets (U.S.). $4.9 billion was absorbed by the public in the form of increased taxation, higher insurance costs, and lost taxes., 210548=Study Population & Data. Crash data were retrieved or derived from the General Estimates System (GES) for the five-year period 1989-93 and are intended to be representative of the population of U.S. police-reported crashes. Fatalities were adjusted to the 1989-93 levels reported in FARS., 84972=Abstract Objective. Since 1975, 26 states have repealed or modified their motorcycle helmet laws. Louisiana (LA) reinstated the helmet law in 1982. The medical and financial impact of repeal in Kansas (KS), reinstatement in LA (accident, fatality, and critical injury rates) have been studied through 1987. Current FARS data and studies from KS, LA, 10 states, and 5 countries are compared and reported., 32725=Data. Motorcycle cases from a large-scale study of open fractures carried out in 1980-1983 by the Department of Orthopedic Surgery were supplemented with data on BAL at admission and disposition at discharge from hospital records, plus billing and insurance information from the patient billing and collecting department., 156915=Study Population, Data, & Methods. A retrospective review of all motorcycle trauma patients with recorded helmet-use status admitted to Harborview Medical Center, a regional level I trauma center, from 1985 to 1989 (five years) was performed. Non-head injury severity was determined by calculating an ISS that did not include head injury. This non-head ISS was used to control for injury severity below the neck. 425 patients were identified., 215153=The costs and incidence observed in the study periods, 1982-86 and 1989-93, reflect the safety measures and practices of those periods. If such factors as traffic density, motorcycle design, helmet construction, or helmet use have changed since then, the results might no longer be directly applicable. Likewise, the results might not be directly applicable to a state where the helmet use rate differs from the 1982-86 national average. Because the study does not report the helmet use rate, it would be difficult to adapt the results to another time or place. Also, the implicit assumption that, within an AIS severity level, the distribution of injuries across body regions is the same for motorcycles as for other vehicles is a troublesome one that could skew the cost estimates., 116667=Study Population & Data. 671 patients reported as injured to the Nebraska Department of Roads in the period from one year before through one year after the reenactment on January 1, 1989, in two urban counties representing 40 percent of Nebraska\u0092s population., 113912=Annual Public Cost Savings with Universal Helmet Use, $1992, 15856=Results. Analysis of statewide crash trends indicate that fatal motorcycle crashes have dropped 69 percent since the introduction of the CMSP, falling from 840 fatal crashes per year in 1986 to 263 in 1995. If crash trends in California had paralleled those in the rest of the United States over this period, the state would have experienced an additional 124 fatalities per year. In a similar analysis truncated at 1991, just before the helmet law went into effect, California would have experienced an additional 76 fatalities and 1,333 injury crashes per year. Using these latter figures, along with costs from Peck and Healy, gives an estimate of annual savings of $113 million from the program., 18898=Why did the crash rate for riders under age 25 increase so much in 1983-86? Were more miles being ridden? Young people taking up riding at a higher rate?, 178589=Study Population. Patients treated for injury at North Carolina\u0092s 8 trauma centers, October 1987-December 1990 (39 months), who 1) were admitted to the hospital for at least 24 hours or 2) died in the ED., 97075=Results & Conclusions. The method of allocating costs to vehicle type was found to be an important determinant of the relative cost for each vehicle type. Motorcycle crashes accounted for 2-5 percent of total crash costs (using the willingness-to-pay methodology). However, motorcycle crashes account for the greatest cost per 1000 vehicle miles ($1,960 over three times greater than the cost for buses, the next most costly per mile) using the excess cost method the authors prefer., 94607=Purpose. These studies compare highway crash incidence, injuries, and costs by vehicle type. Four methods for allocating costs among different vehicle types are considered in the first article (1998); the second (1999) includes three of these methods. The methods correspond to different perspectives, including that of occupants of a vehicle and that of society under different property right assignments. Costs based on the allocation methods for the United States as a whole and per vehicle mile are estimated and presented by vehicle type. The 1999 article also includes bicycles, railroad transportation, and air travel., 51440=Conclusion. Universal helmet use by all motorcyclists in Wisconsin during 1991 potentially would have prevented 60 brain injuries, 13 skull fractures with no intracranial injury, 8 concussions, and 14 deaths. It could also have saved society more than $400,000 in medical charges for initial hospital admissions., 4840=Hospitalizations. During 1988, a total of 2,623 motorcycle crash victims (2,222, or 85 percent, in traffic crashes) were hospitalized, resulting in a hospitalization rate of 80.4 (68.1 traffic) per 100,000 persons per year. Males 15-19 and 20-24 years of age had very high morbidity rates (464 and 462 total, 409 and 416 traffic). Maori had a higher morbidity rate than non-Maori in traffic crashes (99 vs. 61). Drivers were the victims in 86 percent of hospitalizations. For hospitalized victims, the injury locations were the lower limb (43 percent), head (23 percent), upper limb (16 percent), trunk (9 percent), internal (5 percent), and other (2 percent). Fractures were the most common injury to the lower and upper limbs (71 percent and 80 percent, respectively), and intracranial injury was the most common head injury (71 percent). The head was the site for 65 percent of severe/critical injuries (AIS>3)., 178838=Data & Methods. Information on injury severity, length of treatment, hospital charges, discharge status, and insurance status for 828 motorcycle operators and 64 passengers, identified by ICD-9 E-code, treated at 8 North Carolina trauma centers during the period October 1987-December 1990. (The data source also included information on 9,657 other roadway crash victims and 15,613 non-roadway trauma victims.) The authors assigned AIS, ISS, and modified ISS, based on ICD-9 diagnosis codes. The modified ISS was calculated excluding the AIS for head injury, since head injury is a dependent variable. (The modified ISS serves as a proxy for crash severity, as opposed to injury severity. AIS scores to body regions other than the head/neck are presumably not affected by helmet use.) Patients were then stratified into quartiles based on the modified ISS, and the various outcome measures were compared by helmet use within each quartile., 19404=Useful Reference Peck, R., and Healy, E.J. \u0093Accident Cost and Benefit Analysis.\u0094 DMV Research Notes, Winter 95/96, Sacramento, CA, 1995., 44765=Data. 173 motorcycle crashes, involving 210 riders, in 1985-1990 in the Munich (Germany) area were documented at the scene by the Bavarian Police. This was followed up by a medical analysis in hospitals and an injury rating using AIS and ISS., 86655=Kansas. The methods were referenced to other articles. One of these, published by NHTSA, was \u0093Impact of the repeal of the Kansas mandatory motorcycle helmet law: 1975-1978,\u0094 (DOT HS-805 773, and executive summary DOT HS-803 959). It outlines the following methods: Data were collected retrospectively for the months July-September of the years 1975-1978 (four periods of three months). During this period, the number of riders involved in crashes rose from 410 to 508, while the number for which helmet data were available fell from 353 to 278. Identification of motorcycle crashes and victims was carried out with the aid of various state agencies, notably the Kansas Department of Transportation, whose data included time and location of crash, type and number of vehicles involved, road conditions, number of riders, and a rough determination of the extent of injuries suffered. Hospitals in the study area helped to confirm the identities of injury victims and assign AIS severity scores to the injuries. In addition, an observational survey of 2,000 motorcycles was carried out during the July-September 1977 at representative locations in the study area.

A total of 1,175 motorcyclist fatalities were identified for the period 1978-1987, resulting in a mortality rate of 3.6 per 100,000 persons per year. Males 15-19 and 20-24 years of age had very high motorcycle traffic mortality rates (25.2 and 26.4, respectively), especially laborers (40.0) and forestry workers (32). Maori and non-Maori had similar rates. Motor vehicle traffic crashes represented 96 percent of the fatalities, and the majority (63 percent) of traffic deaths were attributable to a collision with another motor vehicle. Drivers were the victims in 88 percent of fatalities., 72548=Conclusion The stark contrast between 1991 (before the law) and 1992-93 (after the law) in the number and cost of head injuries leaves little room for quibbling with the article\u0092s conclusion that the helmet law saves lives, health, and money, 71211=The helmet law took effect on 1 January 1992, making for a clear cut-off between pre-law and post-law periods.

Data sources included summary reports from the Highway Safety Commission, crash reports, hospital discharge files, coroner\u0092s reports, and helmet observation studies., 199652=Study Populations, Data, & Methods. The study samples from a mandatory registry that captures all hospital admissions for \u0093head injury\u0094 from occupants in motorcycle crashes in Taipei. Of 8,221 cases from July 1989 through June 1994 (five years), 80 cases per year were randomly selected for follow-up. Among the 400 sample cases, linkage to mortality files revealed 44 victims died. Self-interviews were completed with 99 victims using the Index of Health-Related Quality of Life (IHQL, Rosser et al. 1992), modified to fit Taiwanese society. The IHQL assesses function along dimensions of pain (none to agonizing), emotional distress (none to extremely depressed), and disability (no physical or social disability to unconscious). The responses were converted to quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss estimates using Rosser\u0092s weights (which were developed with the theoretically sound standard gamble method of direct utility loss measurement). The QALY losses were summed over time, without discounting to present value, to obtain what the authors called a Quality-Adjusted Survival Time (QAST). Victims were interviewed in 1995 and again in 1996 about their status on the IHQL and were asked to recall their status earlier in the post-injury period (but not pre-injury).

Motorcycles and bicycles have the highest costs per 1,000 vehicle and passenger miles; costs per victim are highest for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists. Costs per vehicle mile for heavy trucks and passenger cars are comparable but exceed costs for light trucks. Passenger vehicle occupants are safest if a crash occurs. Light truck, other single truck, and bus occupants have the lowest cost per passenger mile, but higher costs than air and rail travelers. Motorcyclists face the greatest risks. Combination trucks may not impose an excess risk to other drivers, but their drivers face large risks.}",

The authors took advantage of this field to look more closely at cases that were E-coded with a fourth digit of 9, indicating the victim\u0092s role in the crash as \u0093unspecified.\u0094 ICD-9 includes fourth digits for identifying motorcycle \u0093drivers\u0094 and \u0093passengers,\u0094 but if the data source identifies the victim simply as a \u0093motorcyclist,\u0094 he will often be coded as \u0093unspecified.\u0094 The authors found 18 motorcycle fatalities (1.5 percent) and 133 motorcycle hospitalizations (5.1 percent) that had been coded as \u0093unspecified.\u0094 This suggests that relying solely on the fourth digits of E-codes to identify motorcyclists will result in undercounts. It is not clear to what extent this New Zealand study is generalizable to the U.S. New Zealand is more rural than the U.S. Do its motorcyclists ride primarily for recreation (as in the U.S.) or for everyday transport? The demographic profile of the riders, however, looks similar to that of the U.S., with a preponderance of young males. There was no examination of the impact of helmet use. Much of the focus is on collision rates as a share of the population or sub-population. While this might be useful for demonstrating the magnitude of the problem and its demographic locus for the purpose of attracting the attention of New Zealand policymakers, it is not a useful measure for our purposes in this study.

It also showed great detail on the body regions affected by motorcycle crashes. Billheimer, J.W. (1998). Evaluation of California motorcyclist safety program.Transportation Research Record 1640, 100-109. Abstract Purpose & Study Population. The California Motorcyclist Safety Program (CMSP) is a legislatively mandated, statewide program that has trained more than 100,000 motorcyclists in the 10 years since its implementation in July 1987. The program is mandatory for riders under 21 seeking a California motorcycle license. The current evaluation traces motorcycle crash trends before and after the formation of the CMSP, compares crash trends in California with those in the remainder of the United States, and analyzes the riding records of matched pairs of 2,351 trained and untrained Southern California riders. Data & Methods. Crash trends: Historical data on motorcycle crashes, registrations, and licensing for 1977-1995 (10 years before and 9 years after implementation of CMSP), broken down by number, severity, and age, were used to plot simple graphs to show trends in annual numbers of crashes, fatalities per registered motorcycle, and crashes per licensed rider",
