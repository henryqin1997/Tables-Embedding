He did distance himself from the rest of the athletes in New York and showed why many consider him among the top athletes and football players in the country. Josh Haden scored a 111.52 at the NIKE Camp at Penn State a year ago and was gunning for the overall SPARQ Rating record this weekend. Heading in to the NIKE Combine in Brooklyn (N.Y.) this past Saturday, there was little doubt who would record the days top SPARQ Rating.
