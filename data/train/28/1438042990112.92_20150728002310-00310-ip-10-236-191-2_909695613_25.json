            "Campus police are always patroling the area and there are emergency alert station all across campus for everyone's safety.",
            "There is no Greek life.",
            "There are clubs for every major, and most are fairly active. There is always something going on on campus, but to stay in the loop be sure to check the website or visit the Lyceum for information.",
            "Walters State is great for anyone that is not exactly sure where they want to go or what they want to do. Also, if someone is having a hard time going away from home, WSCC offers a lot of majors and most classes transfer to four year institutions in the surrounding area.",
            "The nursing program is located on the bottom floor of the technology building, and the student tutoring lab is located on the lower level of the Lyceum.",
            "$3,000 dollars are year compared to $12,000+ is a great deal.",
            "There are many different things that go on on campus. Athletics, plays, movie showings, and club meetings can always be found.",
            "The cafe has a lot of choices. People are always inside eating and having fun.",
            "There are not dorms on campus. It is a commuting school.",
            "The academics are, sometimes, easier compared to four year institutions. Even though the work is not as hard, I am still learning the same things as my friends that attend four year schools just at an easier pace for me to understand.",
            "Get to school about fifteen minutes prior to class time, especially for afternoon classes, because parking spaces fill up fast. Get to know the faculty because they can help in deciding what you want to do or where you want to go or help in getting you to where you want to be.",
            "Walters State is a great school to start out. Small classes and being close to home made the transition from high school into college much easier. The professors and other faculty are very friendly and helpful, which makes the experience a lot better."
