    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Elgin Community College is great for students who have not yet decided what they want to major in. The college offers a wide array of classes to explore and many outside-of-the-classroom opportunities. You will always save a lot of money! Tips for prospective students I would advise you to attend a community college first, even though you may want to move on to a four-year institution. It will prepare you for a smoother transition and you will save so much money on your general education classes. Bang for the buck ECC offers quality education for a very reasonable price. I was a full time student and was able to pay for all my classes as well as books with under $4000. Am enjoying being here The college has more than 40 active clubs and organizations on the campus. With all the constant activities going on, there is never a boring day and you will never want to leave! Am learning a lot Elgin Community College has a great student to teacher ratio and the quality of the education is high. Many of the professors are trained professionals",
