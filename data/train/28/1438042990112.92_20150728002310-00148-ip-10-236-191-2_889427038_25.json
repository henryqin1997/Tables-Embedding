Bang for the buck If you want to save a ton of money, and get a great education harper is ranked one of the best community colleges, if like me you fall in love with the school but dont live in the district, many people dont know that you can also work in the district part time and still get the discount which is pretty amazing! Am enjoying being here Im trying to get into advertising and im taking my gen eds at harper, what truely got my attention was the design Harper has amazing Architeture and a garden in the middle of all their buildings. Which in the summer is filled with amazing flowers and green grass and has water fountians, and ponds. The atmposhere is unique. As well at the instructors are able to be flexible with their learning techinques, and aid in any subject is avaiable , I was relieved to find out they had a math help lab and 4 current teachers at harper were always their aiding students.",
