A data source can be any source of data or anything that identifies a source of information. Examples of a data source include a file, a database, a directory, etc. FIG. 2 also shows more detail of a subset of components of server 102. Server 102 can be any type of server that can perform the functions described herein. One example of one appropriate server for the present invention can be found in U.S. patent application filed on Mar. 5, 2002, \u201cPresentation Server,\u201d Attorney Docket No. LZLO-01001US0, noted above and incorporated herein by reference. FIG. 2 shows server 102 including data connectors 134 and 136. Data connector 134 is in communication with data source 130. Data connector 136 is in communication with data source 132. The data connectors include software programmed to communicate with a data source. In one embodiment, there may be one data connector for each type of source (e.g. one data connector for an SQL database and another data connector for an LDAP directory). Other types of data connectors can also be used. In another embodiment, there may be one data connector for each data source, regardless of the format of the data. FIG. 2 also shows each data connector having a data view. For example, data connector 134 includes data view 138. Data connector 136 includes data view 140. A data view identifies a set of records (or other items) from a data source that can be accessed by an application. In other words, a data view describes a portion (or all) of a data source that will be used by the application. For example, in an SQL database, a data view can identify certain tables or certain records, etc. In order to allow the user to update records offline, data view definitions should not include overlapping fields. In one embodiment, a data view is a set of tabular records., 157316=[0082] 2002/02/12 17:38:00 PST Feb. 02, 2002, 5:38 pm PST, 49089=[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/349,671, entitled, \u201cInteractive System,\u201d filed on Jan. 16, 2002, incorporated herein by reference., 156831=[0081] Type: Data type of column.

All three elements must have app-id and path attributes defined. The app-id is the id of the requesting application and path is the location where the application developer wants to store the data. Furthermore, the set-cookie element takes a required max-age attribute, where max-age is the number of seconds since Jan. 1, 1970. Max-age determines how long an entry will live in the cookie cache. A max-age of 0 invalidates the entry., 157417=[0083] 2000/01/01 00:00:00 GMT Jan. 01, 2000, 12 am GMT}",
