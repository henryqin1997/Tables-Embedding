No. 09/248,910, filed Feb. 12, 1999 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,181., 111493=A large range of container sizes may be considered. When selecting the size of the container, the factors to be taken into consideration are especially the solubility of epothilones in an aqueous medium, easy handling, and if appropriate, storage of the container. It is preferable to use containers which hold between ca. 200 and 1000 ml of infusion solution., 64147=or (variant 2) first of all exclusion chromatography takes place (molecular filtration) e.g. on a column of material such as Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) with an alcohol such as methanol as eluant, and then subsequent separation of the epothilones present in the peak fractions obtained, e.g. epothilone A and B, by reversed-phase chromatography as described above for variant 1; if required twice, if peak fractions of one epothilone contain those of another, for example if those with epothilone A still contain residues of epothilone B; and then separate recrystallisation of each epothilone from appropriate solvents o r solvent mixtures, for example from ethyl or isopropyl acetate:toluene 1:10 to 10:1, preferably 2:3 (epothilone A) or methanol or ethyl acetate (epothilone B). This is variant 2 of working up and purification., 58815=separation of the epothilones by reversed-phase chromatography after being taken up in a suitable solvent, and elution with a mixture of nitrile/water (compulsory), preferably characterised in that the chromatography is carried out on a column of material, especially a RP-18 material, which is charged with hydrocarbon chains, such as hydrocarbon chains containing 18 carbon atoms, and an eluant comprising a nitrile, especially a lower alkyl-nitrile, in particular acetonitrile, is used, in particular a mixture of nitrile/water is used, especially a mixture of acetonitrile/water, preferably in a ratio of nitrile to water of about 1:99 to 99:1, primarily between 1:9 and 9:1, e.g. between 2:8 and 7:3, e.g. 3:7 or 4:6., 68024=Variant 2 is effected preferably as follows: After harvest, a culture is separated into the liquid phase (centrifugate) and solid phase (cells) by means of centrifugation (tubular centrifuge or separator). The main part of the epothilones are found in the centrifugate, which is then directly mixed with a polystyrene resin, such as Amberlite XAD-16 [Rohm & Haas Germany GmbH, Frankfurt] or Diaion HP-20 [Resindion S.R.L., Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Milan] (preferably in a ratio of centrifugate: resin volume of ca. 10:1 to 100:1, preferably about 50:1) and stirred in an agitator. In this step, the epothilones are transferred from the cyclodextrin to the resin. After a period of contact of ca. 1 hour, the resin is separated by centrifugation or filtration. Adsorption of the epothilones onto the resin may also be effected in a chromatography column, by placing the resin in the column and running the centrifugate over the resin. After adsorption, the resin is washed with water. Desorption of the epothilones from the resin is effected with isopropanol. The isopropanol phase is then freed of isopropanol preferably by the addition of water in particular in a circulating evaporator, and the resulting water phase is extracted with ethyl acetate. The epothilones are thus transferred from the water phase to the ethyl acetate phase. Then the ethyl acetate extract is concentrated to dryness, for example using a rotary evaporator. An initial concentration of the epothilones is then achieved by means of molecular filtration (e.g. Sephadex LH-20 [Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden] with methanol as eluant). The peak fractions from the molecular filtration contain epothilone A and B and have a total epothilone content of >10%. Separation of these peak fractions, which contain epothilone A and B in a mixture, into the individual components, then follows by means of chromatography on a \u201creversed-phase\u201d, e.g. RP-18 phase (phase which is modified by alkyl radicals containing 18 carbon atoms per chain), with an appropriate eluant, preferably one containing a nitrile such as acetonitrile (this gives better separation than for example alcohols such as methanol). Epothilone A elutes before epothilone B. The peak fractions with epothilone B may still contain small portions of epothilone A, which can be removed by further separation on RP-18. Finally, the epothilone A fraction is crystallised directly from ethyl acetate:toluene=2:3, and the epothilone B fraction from methanol or ethyl acetate., 81208=A further preferred aspect of the invention relates to a method of separating epothilones, especially epothilones A and B from one another, which is characterised by chromatography on a reversed-phase column with an eluant containing a lower alkyl cyanide, chromatography being carried out on a column material, especially an RP-18 material, which is charged with hydrocarbon chains containing 18 carbon atoms, and employing an eluant containing a nitrile, especially a lower alkylnitrile, in particular acetonitrile, especially a mixture of nitrile/water, in particular a mixture of acetonitrile/water, preferably in a ratio of nitrile to water of ca. 1:99 to 99:1, primarily 1:9 to 9:1, e.g. between 2:8 and 7:3, e.g. 3:7 or 4:6. This separation may follow on to a filtration with a molecular sieve, or is preferably effected directly using the residue after adsorption of the epothilones from the culture medium containing a complex-forming component onto a resin, as described above (\u201cvariant 1\u201d). One advantage of separation with an eluant containing a lower alkylcyanide over that using alcohols, such as methanol, is the better separation of epothilones A and B., 56578=Working up of the epothilones is effected by conventional methods; first of all, by separating a culture into the liquid phase (centrifugate or filtrate) and solid phase (cells) by means of filtration or centrifugation (tubular centrifuge or separator). The (main) part of the epothilones found in the centrifugate or in the filtrate is then directly mixed with a synthetic resin, for example a resin based on polystyrene as matrix (hereinafter referred to also simply as polystyrene resin), such as Amberlite XAD-16 [Rohm & Haas Germany GmbH, Frankfurt] or Diaion HP-20 [Resindion S. R. L., Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Milan] (preferably in a ratio of centrifugate: resin volume of ca. 10:1 to 100:1, preferably about 50:1). After a period of contact of preferably 0.25 to 50 hours, especially 0.8 to 22 hours, the resin is separated, for example by filtration or centrifugation. If required, after adsorption, the resin is washed with a strongly polar solvent, preferably with water. Desorption of the epothilones is then effected with an appropriate solvent, especially with an alcohol, in particular isopropanol. The solvent phase, especially the isopropanol phase, is then removed from the solvent, preferably by means of prior, simultaneous or subsequent addition of water, in particular in a circulating evaporator, thereby being concentrated if necessary, and the resulting water phase is extracted with a solvent suitable for forming a second phase, such as an ester, for example a lower alkanol lower alkanoate, typically ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate. The epothilones are thereby transferred into the organic phase. Then the organic phase is concentrated to the extent necessary, preferably to dryness, for example using a rotary evaporator., 109289=The infusion solution can be diluted with the aqueous medium. The amount of aqueous medium used is chosen according to the desired concentration of active ingredient in the infusion solution. The infusion solution is preferably produced by mixing a vial or an ampoule containing the infusion concentrate (see above) with an aqueous medium, so that a volume of between 200 ml and 1000 ml is attained with the aqueous medium. Infusion solutions may contain other additives that are normally used in formulations for intravenous administration. These additives also include antioxidants., 202054=Ca. 300 g of the above-mentioned ethyl acetate extract (with a content of ca. 1-1.5% epothilone B) are suspended in 1.5 litres of acetonitrile/water=3/1 (v/v), the solution is filtered through a folded filter and the filtrate added to a C-18 RP column [Prochrom apparatus with 30 cm internal column diameter (Prochrom, Champigneulles, France) 25 kg YMC gel, ODS-A, 120 Angstroem pore diameter, 5-15 \u03bcm grain size, spherical]. Elution is effected with acetonitrile/water=4/6 (v/v) at a flow rate of 2300 ml/min. Fractionation is monitored by means of on-line HPLC [rapid HPLC at high temperatures (ca. 80\ufffd C.), on a short separating column (4.6 mm internal diameter\ufffd75 mm length) and very small RP-18 particles (3.5 \u03bcm spherical), typical analysis times are <1 minute, detection at 250 nm]. The valuable fractions (those with only epothilone B) are combined, the acetonitrile removed by distillation and the aqueous phase extracted twice with isopropyl acetate. The organic phases are concentrated by distillation and the isopropyl acetate extract is obtained as the residue of evaporation., 200052=The volume of harvest from the 3000 litre main culture is 2900 litres and is separated using a Westfalia clarifying separator Type SA-20-06 (rpm=6500, flow rate 1400 litres/hour) into the liquid phase (centrifugate+rinsing water=2750 litres) and solid phase (cells=ca. 260 kg). The main part of the epothilones are found in the centrifugate, The centrifuged cell pulp contain <15% of the determined epothilone portion and is not further processed. The 2750 litre centrifugate is then placed in a 4000 litre steel stirring vessel, mixed with 60 litres of Amberlite XAD-16 (centrifugate:resin volume=46:1) and stirred. After a period of contact of 16-20 hours, the resin is centrifuged away in a Heine overflow centrifuge (basket content 40 litres; rpm=2800). The centrifuge is emptied by rinsing the basket content with deionised water when the centrifuge is stationary. The XAD-16/deionised water slurry is thereafter freed from water on a suction filter (\ufffd 50 cm) and the resin washed with 30 litres of deionised water. Desorption of the resin is effected by stirring it in a 1600 litre stirring vessel twice, each time with 220 litres of isopropanol for 30 minutes. Separation of the isopropanol phase from the resin takes place using a suction filter (\ufffd 50 cm). The isopropanol is then removed from the isopropanol phase by adding 240-260 litres of water in a vacuum-operated circulating evaporator (Schmid-Verdampfer) and the resulting water phase of ca. 125 litre is extracted 3\ufffd each time with 100-125 litres of ethyl acetate. Extraction is effected in 1600 litre steel stirring vessels. The ethyl acetate extracts are combined, concentrated to 3-5 litres in vacuum-operated circulating evaporators (B\ufffdchi Verdampfer/Schmid-Verdampfer) and afterwards concentrated to dryness in a rotary evaporator (B\ufffdchi type) under vacuum. An ethyl acetate extract of 590 g is obtained., 194990=Main culture: The media substances for 3000 litres are sterilised in 2100 litres of water, then 300 litres of a sterile 10% 2-(hydroxypropyl)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin solution are added, and seeded with 600 litres of an intermediate culture. The duration of the main culture is 6-7 days, and the conditions are: 30\ufffd C., 100 rpm, 0.5 litres of air per litre liquid per minute, 0.5 bars excess pressure, pH control with H2SO4/KOH to pH 7.6+/\u22120.5 (i.e. no control between pH 7.1 and 8.1). The progress of fermentation is illustrated in Table 6., 60511=recrystallisation, e.g. from appropriate solvents or solvent mixtures, for example consisting of esters, ester/hydrocarbon mixtures or alcohols, especially ethyl or isopropyl acetate:toluene 1:10 to 10:1, preferably 2:3 (epothilone A) or methanol or ethyl acetate (epothilone B);, 49221=Epothilones are primarily epothilone A and/or B, but also other epothilones, for example epothilones C and D named in International Application WO 97/19086 and WO 98/22461, epothilones E and F named in WO 98/22461, and further epothilones obtainable from corresponding microorganisms., 61258=either by direct separation of the epothilones from one another by reversed-phase chromatography after being taken up in an appropriate solvent, for example a nitrile/water mixture, especially an acetonitrile/water mixture (ratio of nitrile to water 1:99 to 99:1, preferably 1:9 to 9:1, especially 3:1), if necessary after filtration or centrifugation, preferably on a silica gel that has been derivatized by hydrocarbon radicals, e.g. a silica gel modified by alkyl radicals containing 8 to 20, especially 18, C-atoms, eluting with an eluant comprising a nitrile, especially a lower alkylnitrile, such as acetonitrile, especially a mixture of the nitrile with water, such as an acetonitrile/water mixture, whereby detection of the interesting fractions is effected in conventional manner, for example by UV detection or (preferably) by on-line HPLC (HPLC with a very small column, the analyses taking less than 1 minute, and detection e.g. at 250 nm), this enabling a particularly exact separation of the fractions containing the desired product to take place; if required, with subsequent concentration, for example by distillation, to remove the nitrile; if desired, with subsequent single or multiple, for example double, extraction of the residue of evaporation in a two-phase system consisting of water and an immiscible solvent, such as ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate; additional concentration of the organic phase and dissolving of the residue in an appropriate solvent, preferably an ester such as ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate, if required, filtration or centrifugation, if desired adding to a column of silica gel and eluting with an appropriate solvent or solvent mixture, for example with a mixture of ester/hydrocarbon, e.g. lower alkyl alkanoate/C4-C10-alkane, especially ethyl or isopropyl acetate/n-hexane, in which the ratio of ester to hydrocarbon is preferably in the range 99:1 to 1:99, preferably 10:1 to 1:10, e.g. 4:1; subsequent combining of the fractions containing each desired epothilone, especially epothilone A or epothilone B, and after removing the solvent, for example by distillation, preferably concentrating to dryness; then, dissolving of the residue in an appropriate alcohol, preferably methanol; and if desired, in order to obtain especially high purity, mixing with activated carbon and then separating the activated carbon, for example by filtration; and finally, by recrystallisation as described below under variant 2 (for epothilone B in particular from methanol), separate extraction of the epothilones, especially epothilones A or B. This is the most preferred variant 1, the outstanding characteristic of which is the surprising direct separation by reversed-phase chromatography of the epothilone-containing mixture desorbed by the resin, despite all the impurities in the organic extract;, 87088=b) comprises a step for separating the epothilones, especially epothilones A and B, from one another, which is characterised by chromatography on a reversed-phase column with an eluant containing a lower alkylcyanide, the chromatography being carried out on a column material, especially an RP-18 material, which is charged with hydrocarbon chains containing 18 carbon atoms, and employing an eluant containing a lower alkylnitrile, especially acetonitrile, in particular a mixture of lower alkylnitrile/water, preferably a mixture of acetonitrile/water, preferably in a ratio of lower alkylnitrile to water of ca. 1:99 to 99:1, primarily 1:9 to 9:1, e.g. between 2:8 and 7:3, e.g. 3:7 or 4:6, whereby if desired, it is possible to use further steps for working up and purification., 181705=The volume of harvest from the 500 litre main culture of example 2D is 450 litres and is separated using a Westfalia clarifying separator Type SA-20-06 (rpm=6500) into the liquid phase (centrifugate+rinsing water=650 litres) and solid phase (cells=ca. 15 kg). The main part of the epothilones are found in the centrifugate. The centrifuged cell pulp contains <15% of the determined epothilone portion and is not further processed. The 650 litre centrifugate is then placed in a 400 litre stirring vessel, mixed with 10 litres of Amberlite XAD-16 (centrifugate:resin volume=65:1) and stirred. After a period of contact of ca. 2 hours, the resin is centrifugate away in a Heine overflow centrifuge (basket content 40 litres; rpm=2800). The resin is discharged from the centrifuge and washed with 10-15 litres of deionised water. Desorption is effected by stirring the resin twice, each time in portions with 30 litre of isopropanol in 30 litre glass stirring vessels for 30 minutes. Separation of the isopropanol phase from the resin takes place using a suction filter. The isopropanol is then removed from the combined isopropanol phases by adding 15-20 litres of water in a vacuum-operated circulating evaporator (Schmid-Verdampfer) and the resulting water phase of ca. 10 litres is extracted 3\ufffd each time with 10 litres of ethyl acetate. Extraction is effected in 30 litre glass stirring vessels. The ethyl acetate extract is concentrated to 3-5 litre in a vacuum-operated circulating evaporator (Schmid-Verdampfer) and afterwards concentrated to dryness in a rotary evaporator (Buchi type) under vacuum. The result is an ethyl acetate extract of 50.2 g. The ethyl acetate extract is dissolved in 500 ml of methanol, the insoluble portion filtered off using a folded filter, and the solution added to a 10 kg Sephadex LH 20 column (Pharmacia Uppsala, Sweden) (column diameter 20 cm, filling level ca. 1.2 m. Elution is effected with methanol as eluant. Epothilone A and B is present predominantly in fractions 21-23 (at a fraction size of 1 litre). These fractions are concentrated to dryness in a vacuum on a rotary evaporator (total weight 9.0 g). These Sephadex peak fractions (9.0 g) are thereafter dissolved in 92 ml of acetonitrile:water:methylene chloride=50:40:2, the solution filtered through a folded filter and added to a RP column (equipment Prepbar 200, Merck; 2.0 kg LiChrospher RP-18 Merck, grain size 12 \u03bcm, column diameter 10 cm, filling level 42 cm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Elution is effected with acetonitrile:water=3:7 (flow rate=500 ml/min.; retention time of epothilone A=ca. 51-59 mins.; retention time of epothilone B=ca. 60-69 mins.). Fractionation is monitored with a UV detector at 250 nm. The fractions are concentrated to dryness under vacuum on a B\ufffdchi-Rotavapor rotary evaporator. The weight of the epothilone A peak fraction is 700 mg, and according to HPLC (external standard) it has a content of 75.1%. That of the epothilone B peak fraction is 1980 mg, and the content according to HPLC (external standard) is 86.6%. Finally, the epothilone A fraction (700 mg) is crystallised from 5 ml of ethyl acetate:toluene=2:3, and yields 170 mg of epothilone A pure crystallisate [content according to HLPC (% of area)=94.3%]. Crystallisation of the epothilone B fraction (1980 mg) is effected from 18 ml of methanol and yields 1440 mg of epothilone B pure crystallisate [content according to HPLC (%) of area=99.2%]. m.p.

In order to obtain a satisfactory concentration of the natural substances, especially the epothilones, in the culture medium for the subsequent extraction, previously an adsorbate resin based on polystyrene was always added, for example Amberlite XAD-1180 (Rohm & Haas, Frankfurt, Germany)., 203924=Ca. 48 g of the combined residues obtained under (iii) (with a content of ca. 90% of epothilone B) are dissolved in 1150 ml of methanol, mixed with 14.5 g of activated carbon and subsequently filtered through a folded filter. The clear filtrate is subsequently concentrated to dryness and the residue is recrystallised from 317 ml of methanol. 29.5 g of epothilone B are obtained in a purity of 99.7%, and with a melting point of 124\ufffd C., 47622=One preferred myxobacterium is a strain selected by UV mutagenesis and selection for increased formation of epothilone A and/or B over Sorangium cellulosum Soce90, which is deposited in the DSM under no. 6773, especially the mutant BCE33/10, which was deposited under the number DSM 11999 on Feb. 9th, 1998 at the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany), and most preferably the mutant having the reference BCE 63/114, which was deposited under number DSM 12539 on Nov. 27th, 1998 at the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ)., 40167=b) It has been reported that, in cell culture experiments, they are also active against the proliferation of cells, which, owing to the activity of the P-glycoprotein efflux pump making them \u201cmultidrug resistant\u201d, show resistance to treatment with other chemotherapy agents including Taxol\ufffd (see Bolag, D.
