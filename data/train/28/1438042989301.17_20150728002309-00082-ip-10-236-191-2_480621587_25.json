The system 1200 includes one or more client(s) 1202. The client(s) 1202 can be hardware and/or software (e.g., threads, processes, computing devices). The client(s) 1202 can house cookie(s) and/or associated contextual information by employing the present invention, for example. The system 1200 also includes one or more server(s) 1204. The server(s) 1204 can also be hardware and/or software (e.g., threads, processes, computing devices). The servers 1204 can house threads to perform transformations by employing the present invention, for example. One possible communication between a client 1202 and a server 1204 may be in the form of a data packet adapted to be transmitted between two or more computer processes. The data packet may include a cookie and/or associated contextual information, for example. The system 1200 includes a communication framework 1206 (e.g., a global communication network such as the Internet) that can be employed to facilitate communications between the client(s) 1202 and the server(s) 1204.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{203453=The computer 1102 further includes a hard disk drive 1114, a magnetic disk drive 1116, (e.g., to read from or write to a removable disk 1118) and an optical disk drive 1120, (e.g., reading a CD-ROM disk 1122 or to read from or write to other high capacity optical media such as Digital Video Disk (DVD)). The hard disk drive 1114, magnetic disk drive 1116 and optical disk drive 1120 can be connected to the system bus 1108 by a hard disk drive interface 1124, a magnetic disk drive interface 1126 and an optical drive interface 1128, respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of data, data structures, computer-executable instructions, and so forth. For the computer 1102, the drives and media accommodate the storage of broadcast programming in a suitable digital format. Although the description of computer-readable media above refers to a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk and a CD, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of media which are readable by a computer, such as zip drives, magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, cartridges, and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating environment, and further that any such media may contain computer-executable instructions for performing the methods of the present invention., 211614=Communications may be facilitated via a wired (including optical fiber) and/or wireless technology. The client(s) 1202 are operably connected to one or more client data store(s) 1208 that can be employed to store information local to the client(s) 1202 (e.g., cookie(s) and/or associated contextual information). Similarly, the server(s) 1204 are operably connected to one or more server data store(s) 1210 that can be employed to store information local to the servers 1204., 206501=The computer 1102 may operate in a networked environment using logical connections via wired and/or wireless communications to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer(s) 1148. The remote computer(s) 1148 may be a workstation, a server computer, a router, a personal computer, portable computer, microprocessor-based entertainment appliance, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described relative to the computer 1102, although, for purposes of brevity, only a memory storage device 1150 is illustrated. The logical connections depicted include a local area network (LAN) 1152 and a wide area network (WAN) 1154. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet., 39640=This application is related to the following co-pending U.S. patent applications: Ser. No. ______ (Atty. Dkt. No. MSFTP518US) entitled \u201cMODEL-BASED MANAGEMENT OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS\u201d filed on Oct. __, 2003; Ser. No. (Atty. Dkt. No. MSFTP520US) entitled \u201cRULES DEFINITION LANGUAGE\u201d filed on Oct. __, 2003; Ser. No. (Atty. Dkt. No. MSFTP521US) entitled \u201cUSING URI'S TO IDENTIFY MULTIPLE INSTANCES WITH A COMMON SCHEMA\u201d filed on Oct. __, 2003; and, Ser. No. ______ (Atty. Dkt. No. MSFTP522US) entitled \u201cUSE OF ATTRIBUTION TO DESCRIBE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION\u201d filed on Oct. __, 2003., 204949=A number of program modules can be stored in the drives and RAM 1112, including an operating system 1130, one or more application programs 1132, other program modules 1134 and program data 1136. All or portions of the operating system, applications, modules, and/or data can also be cached in the RAM 1112., 205542=A user can enter commands and information into the computer 1102 through a keyboard 1138 and a pointing device, such as a mouse 1140. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, an IR remote control, a joystick, a game pad, a satellite dish, a scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit 1104 through a serial port interface 1142 that is coupled to the system bus 1108, but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, a game port, a universal serial bus (\u201cUSB\u201d), an IR interface, etc. A monitor 1144 or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus 1108 via an interface, such as a video adapter 1146. In addition to the monitor 1144, a computer typically includes other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers, printers etc., 202683=The system bus 1108 can be any of several types of bus structure that may further interconnect to a memory bus (with or without a memory controller), a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of commercially available bus architectures. The system memory 1106 includes read only memory (ROM) 1110 and random access memory (RAM) 1112. A basic input/output system (BIOS) is stored in a non-volatile memory 1110 such as ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, which BIOS contains the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the computer 1102, such as during start-up. The RAM 1112 can also include a high-speed RAM such as static RAM for caching data., 207401=When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer 1102 is connected to the local network 1152 through a wired or wireless communication network interface or adapter 1156. The adaptor 1156 may facilitate wired or wireless communication to the LAN 11 52, which may also include a wireless access point disposed thereon for communicating with the wireless adaptor 1156. When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer 1102 typically includes a modem 1158, or is connected to a communications server on the LAN, or has other means for establishing communications over the WAN 1154, such as the Internet. The modem 1158, which may be internal or external and a wired or wireless device, is connected to the system bus 1108 via the serial port interface 1142. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer 1102, or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device 1150. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used., 208640=The computer 1102 is operable to communicate with any wireless devices or entities operably disposed in wireless communication, e.g., a printer, scanner, desktop and/or portable computer, portable data assistant, any piece of equipment or location associated with a wirelessly detectable tag (e.g., a kiosk, news stand, restroom), and telephone. This includes at least Wi-Fi and Bluetooth\u2122 wireless technologies. Thus the communication may be a predefined structure as with conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices.}",
