See Note: Scoring In Oracle Data Mining, the apply operation is not applicable to association models and attribute importance models. For predictive mining functions, the apply process generates predictions in a target column. For descriptive mining functions such as clustering, the apply process assigns each case to a cluster with a probability. This procedure applies a mining model to the data of interest, and generates the results in a table. The apply process is also referred to as scoring.

    "textAfterTable": "Usage Notes The data provided for APPLY must undergo the same preprocessing as the data used to create and test the model. When you use Automatic Data Preparation, the preprocessing required by the algorithm is handled for you by the model \u2014 both at build time and apply time. (See \"Automatic Data Preparation\".) APPLY creates a table in the user's schema to hold the results. The columns are algorithm-specific. The columns in the results table are listed in Table 44-23 through Table 44-27. The case ID column name in the results table will match the case ID column name provided by you. The type of the incoming case ID column is also preserved in APPLY output. Note: Make sure that the case ID column does not have the same name as one of the columns that will be created by APPLY. For example, when applying a classification model, the case ID in the scoring data must not be ' PREDICTION' or ' PROBABILITY' (See Table 44-23). The data type for the 'PREDICTION', 'CLUSTER_ID', and 'FEATURE_ID' output columns is influenced by any reverse expression that is embedded in the model by the user. If the user does not provide a reverse expression that alters the scored value type, then the types will conform to the descriptions in the following tables. See \"ALTER_REVERSE_EXPRESSION Procedure\".",
