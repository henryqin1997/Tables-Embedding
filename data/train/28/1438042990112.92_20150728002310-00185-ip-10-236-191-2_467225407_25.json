Techniques for determining a focus position based on a CCD data stream are known. For example, reference is made to \u201cThe Encyclopedia of Photography\u201d editors Leslie Stroebel and Richard Zakia, published 1993 by Butterworth-Heinemann and \u201cApplied Photographic Optics\u201d by London & Boston, Focal Press, 1988. These techniques primarily rely on measurements of contrast between adjacent pixels over portions of an input image. The image is initally processed by the ACP in order to determine a correct autofocus setting.}",
