Classes with still be challenging and useful, just longer., 501774=There are alot of demands for other classes that is needed to graduate with a degree such as taking Liberal Arts. Including that with the courses with majors, the work is stressful depending on the courses or the amount is taken. With the Conversion Term to now Semesters. In 2012-2013 year, the classes were only 10 weeks long in quarters. Now from 2013 and on, will be 15 weeks long in Semesters instead. More time with assignments, projects and in terms of learning. It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I\u2019ve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn\u2019t know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn\u2019t really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they\u2019re the first ones you run into when you\u2019re moving all your stuff in and they\u2019re also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don\u2019t think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot My current major is Microelectronic Engineering. RIT is the only school in the nation that offers this major. This school is fantastic and has actually challenged me. I was used to getting an A in everything but in this school that's not possible for me. The teachers in general are great and because this is a hands on and co-op school it makes the learning process a lot easier.

However, students who want to succeed here also need to be dedicated workers and dedicated to doing well. You can have the best intentions and procrastinate and then go out with your friends more and more frequently but then before you",
