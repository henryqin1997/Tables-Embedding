I have to put a lot of time into homework, but as a whole it's fun for me as I'm totally invested in getting my degree and certificate in Pharmacy Tech. There are a wide range of classes offered at C.O.C.C. and a very positive environment maintained on campus that invigorates the mind and works toward continuing enrichment.",
            "It is important to have a plan mapped out as to which career or major your interested in. It is imperative that you have two to three schedules chosen for each term so that if you can't get into your first choice for classes, you have back up choices ready. Be sure to check your campus e-mail daily if not a couple of times each day that's where professors log changes in the class syllabus or alert you to cancellation of class.",
            "I attended one year of College back in 1979-1980...I just started back to school this fall of 2012. It's been along time since I've been to school but I have good instructors and I'm learning far more now than I did back then. C.O.C.C. is a good school and it sits on a beautiful campus what more could a girl ask for? I love having blackboard to do assignments on makes life a whole lot easier."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students COCC is perfect for anybody because no matter who you are or what you look like people will accept you. Tips for prospective students Definitely check all you options but COCC is a great place to start because they have lots of options to chose from so you can start your education close to home. Bang for the buck I decided to attend COCC instead of OSU for my first two years because the tuition cost are reasonable. At OSU the tuition would have been very expensive but COCC is about right and I could afford everything I needed. Also if you cant afford all the cost COCC is willing to help you so you can go to school and get an education. Am enjoying being here Everybody at the college is really helpful and nice. The teacher especially are fantastic because they sometimes act like one of the kids instead of a teacher. This makes learning more fun and easier. Also the students are great because no matter if you are their friend or not they will help you if you need it. The campus in general is a great place to be.",
