The\u00a0Pavilion (5:38 h) and the\u00a0IdeaPad G780 (5:49 h) only run a tad longer. We test the idle scenario by means of the Battery Eater Reader's test with energy saving profile, disabled Wi-Fi modules and lowest display brightness. \u00a0Under load the\u00a0K75VJ only runs\u00a00:55 h on battery. The HP's battery life of 0:46 h is even shorter, while the G780 does not shut down before 1:34 h. As usual, we used the Battery Eater Classic with maximum display brightness, high performance profile and enabled Wi-Fi modules to record the minimum battery runtime., 122574=The K75VJ can play current computer games in medium and often also in high quality at a resolution of 1366x768 pixels without problems. Frugal games like FIFA 13 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive also run smoothly in Full HD resolution \u00a0(1920x1080 pixels). In cutting-edge, performance-hungry games like\u00a0Hitman: Absolution the limits of the\u00a0GeForce GT 635M GPU get obvious. This game can barely be played at medium settings. The following table about Anno 2070 depicts that the\u00a0Radeon HD 7670M\u00a0in the\u00a0Pavilion is the fastest\u00a0GPU in our comparison. Its frame rates are a tad higher than the K75VJ's., 91171=The integrated\u00a0Intel HD Graphics 4000\u00a0and the dedicated Nvidia GeForce GT 635M\u00a0are responsible for graphics. The GeForce chip is a mid-range graphics card, supports\u00a0DirectX 11\u00a0and uses\u00a02 GB video memory. In the K75VJ, its maximum clock rate is 661.5 MHz. The integrated graphics chip from Intel also supports DirectX 11 and clocks between 350 MHz and 1150 MHz., 199016=Our Asus ends the\u00a0WLAN test after\u00a03:36 h (HP: 3:53 h, Lenovo: 3:22 h). Here our looping script automatically loads web sites in 40-second intervals. The energy saving profile is active and the display brightness is set to 150 cd/m\u00b2. A full battery capacity is sufficient for 2:36 h DVD playback. The values of the competitors (Pavilion: 2:52 h, G780: 2:30 h) do not differ much. The DVD test is run with energy saving profile (or higher, if the DVD does not play smoothly), maximum display brightness and active Wi-Fi modules. As the three notebooks have batteries with nearly identical capacities (HP, Lenovo: 48 Wh; Asus: 50 Wh) the battery runtimes are easily comparable.}",
