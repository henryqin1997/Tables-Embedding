            "It's safe b/c there are security guards everywhere in the college, and theyr'e very helpful too if you're lost, and need help finding which building to go to class, pay bills, etc.",
            "They have a few clubs and activities to do, but I don't care for them to be hones since I'm there to get a degree, nothing more than that.",
            "The students in the school are pretty nice, and the teachers are good at what they do overall, so if you like that, you should try out this schoo. I also like how flexible the class schedules are, which makes things much easier for me in the long run (and for anybody who likes a flexible schudule too). Also, the buildings aren't that far away from each other, so I get to class on time everyday (good for students who never want to be late when going to class).",
            "I do believe that the books are overpriced, including the used ones, but that's not a big deal. Also, they could make payment for classes cheaper b/c it's expensive. For example, I'm just doing one class in Winter Session now, but it costs over $500 just for that class (which to me is too much). Besides that though, I like the college so far.",

Didnt go to CIA or J&W but learn just as much or probably even more for like 3/4 of the price Am learning a lot I am in the Culinary Program at Hudson. This was propably the best choice that i could have ever made. It is a small school with well trained chef that are still working in the buisness and teach. They really do care about the students getting better and wanting to become a great chef. It is",
