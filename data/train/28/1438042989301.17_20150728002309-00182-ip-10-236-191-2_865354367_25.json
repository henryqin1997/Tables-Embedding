All groups in the directory are defined using the following object classes: The groupOfUniqueNames object class contains all of the group attributes defined by IETF (RFC 2256). The orclGroup object class contains a set of standard, additional attributes for Oracle Portal. Note: In Oracle Portal 9.0.2 and subsequent releases, you cannot scope groups to a specific page group. This option was available only in Oracle Portal 3.0.9.x and preceding releases. Figure 7-8 shows where the Oracle Portal information for groups is located in the directory's DIT structure.
