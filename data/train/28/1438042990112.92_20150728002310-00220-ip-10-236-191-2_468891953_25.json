To this solution was added 36.64 g neodymium nitrate hexahydrate salt, Nd(NO3)3.6H2O (Alfa/Aesar reagent #12912, CAS #16454-60-7), equivalent to 32.90 wt % Nd. Endothermic dissolution of the neodymium nitrate hexahydrate proceeded under ambient temperature conditions, eventually forming a pale lavender homogeneous solution. A block of O-Cel-O\u2122 sponge was fully imbibed with this reactant solution as described in Example 39. The sample was first fired at 500\ufffd C. for 1 hour and then at 800\ufffd C. for 15 minutes. The inorganic sponge sample was pale lavender in color at the outside of the inorganic sponge mass and light gray in the interior (due to residual carbon). The inorganic sponge mass was very fragile, but it was robust enough to be handled as a coherent block of low density, highly porous material. An XRD pattern (FIG. 18) was obtained from a packed powder sample prepared as described in Example 39. Peak analysis indicated the solid to consist of neodymium phosphate, NdPO4 (PDF 25-1065).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{66163=The present invention is directed to the preparation, production and use of shaped bodies of inorganic materials. It will be appreciated that shaped bodies can be elaborated in a number of ways, which shaped bodies comprise an inorganic material. A preferred method for giving rise to the shaped bodies comprising minerals is through the use of subject matter disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 08/784,439 filed Jan. 16, 1997, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. In accordance with techniques preferred for use in conjunction with the present invention, a blend of materials are formed which can react to give rise to the desired mineral, or precursor thereof, at relatively low temperatures and under relatively flexible reaction conditions. Preferably, the reactive blends thus used include oxidizing agents and materials which can be oxidized by the oxidizing agent, especially those which can give rise to a phosphorus oxoanion. Many aspects of this chemistry are described hereinafter in the present specification. It is to be understood, however, that such reactive blends react at modest temperatures under modest reaction conditions, usually through the evolution of a nitrogen oxide gas, to give rise to the minerals desired for preparation or to materials which may be transformed such as through heating or sintering to form such minerals. A principal object of the present invention is to permit such minerals to be formed in the form of shaped bodies., 106640=It is well known in the art that for solutions in equilibrium with ionic precipitates, the solute concentrations of the reactant ions are dictated by solubility product relationships and supersaturation limitations. For the Ca2+\u2014[PO4]\u22123 system, these expressions are exceedingly complicated, due in large part to the numerous pathways (i.e., solid phases) for relieving the supersaturation conditions. Temperature, pH, ionic strength, ion pair formation, the presence of extraneous cations and anions all can affect the various solute species equilibria and attainable or sustainable supersaturation levels (F.

Thus, despite the various synthetic pathways for producing calcium phosphate precursors, the \u201cbasic\u201d calcium phosphate materials used in the art (Ca/P\u22671.5) have generally all been subjected to a high temperature treatment, often for extensive periods of time.

Res. 69(12): 1852 (1990), 230664=A piece of damp (as removed from the packaging) cellulose sponge (O-Cel-O\u2122, 3M Home and Commercial Care Division, P.O. Box 33068, St. Paul. MN 55133), trimmed to a block approximately 1.5\u2033\ufffd1.5\u2033\ufffd2.0\u2033, was immersed in the calcium nitrate+hypophosphorous acid solution and kneaded (alternately compressed and decompressed) to fully imbibe the reactant solution into the sponge. The approximately 4.5 cubic inch sponge block (approximately 3.5 g), thoroughly saturated with reactant solution (liquid uptake approximately 7 to 8 times the virgin sponge weight), was placed on a platinum plate in a laboratory furnace (Vulcan model 3-550, NEYTECH, Inc., 1280 Blue Hills Ave., Bloomfield, Conn. 06002) that was preheated to 500\ufffd C. After several seconds, a reaction commenced at the surface of the sponge with the evolution of red-brown fumes characteristic of NOx(g). As the reaction proceeded from the surface to the interior of the sponge block, NOx(g) evolution continued and some reactant liquid exuded from the sponge and accumulated at the bottom of the Pt plate as a crusty white mass of solid. The cellulose sponge itself was consumed as the reaction progressed and the reactant mass attained the oven temperature. After thermal treatment at 500\ufffd C. for 45 minutes, the sample was removed from the lab furnace. The sample had been converted to an inorganic replica of the original organic sponge structure. The vestigial structure represented a positive version of the original sponge structure with faithful replication of the cellular elements, porosity, and macrostructure. The vestigial mass was mottled gray suggesting the presence of some residual carbon in the structure due to incomplete burnout of the combustion products from the cellulose sponge matrix. The vestigial mass was fragile with very low apparent density, but it was robust enough to be handled as a coherent block of highly porous solid once it was removed from the exudate material., 215478=An aqueous solution of 11.23 g of 50 wt. % H3PO2 was diluted with 5.00 g distilled water to form a clear, colorless solution contained in a 250 ml fluoropolymer resin beaker on a hotplate/magnetic stirrer. Added to this solution was 36.94 g cerium nitrate hexahydrate salt, Ce(NO3)3\u20146H2O (Johnson-Matthey reagent #11329-36), equivalent to 32.27 wt % Ce. The molar ratio of the Ce/P in this mixture was 1/1 and the equivalent solids level (as CePO4) was 37.6 wt %. Endothermic dissolution of the neodymium nitrate hexahydrate salt proceeded with gradual warming of the reaction mixture, eventually forming a clear, homogeneous colorless solution at room temperature. Heating of this solution with constant agitation to approximately 65\ufffd C. initiated a vigorous endothermic reaction which resulted in the evolution of NOx (g), rapid temperature increase of the sample to approximately >100\ufffd C., and finally, formation of a pasty light grey mass. Heat treatment of the pasty solid and subsequent X-ray diffraction analysis of the fired solid were conducted as described in Example 1. Results of the XRD analysis are as follows:, 234305=The material from Example 39 was fired under a variety of conditions in order to (1) eliminate residual carbon from the structure and (2) attempt to promote sintering reactions in order to strengthen the inorganic sponge matrix. The samples were fired on Pt plates in a Lindberg model 51333 box furnace (Lindberg/Blue M, Inc., 304 Hart St., Watertown, Wis. 53094) equipped with a Lindberg series 59000 control console. The following table summarizes these results:, 31442=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/999,506, filed Nov. 15, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,246, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/253,556, filed Feb. 19, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,383,519, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/117,254 filed Jan. 26, 1999., 266979=A reactant solution was prepared as described in Example 39. Disks were cut from a sheet of 3/32 inch thick Normandy compressed sponge using a \u215c inch diameter hollow punch and a model no. 3393 Carver hydraulic press (Carver Inc., 1569 Morris St., P.O. Box 544, Wabash, Ind. 46992) to ensure uniform sizing. The disks were distended by immersion in deionized water and the resulting sponge cylinders, each approximately \u215c inch diameter by 1 inch length, were then blotted on paper towel to remove as much excess water as possible. The damp sponge cylinders were then imbibed with approximately seven times their weight of the reactant liquid. Nine of the solution imbibed pieces were placed horizontally and spaced uniformly in a 100\ufffd20 mm Pyrex petri dish. Two petri dishes, containing a total of 18 imbibed sponge cylinders, were positioned in the center of the cavity of a microwave oven (Hotpoint model no. RE963-001, Louisville, Ky. 40225) and the samples were irradiated at full power for a total of two minutes. After 30 seconds of exposure, the microwave oven cavity was full of NOx(g) and the reactant liquid which had exuded from the sponge cylinders had reacted/dehydrated to form a crusty white deposit in the petri dishes. The oven was opened to vent the cavity, then full power irradiation was resumed. After another 30 seconds of exposure, the oven cavity was again full of NOx(g) and steam. After venting the cavity once more, full power exposure was resumed for an additional 60 seconds, after which the fully dry sponge cylinders were removed. The sponge cylinders retained the orange color of the original cellulose material and a considerable fraction of the pores were filled with white solid. The pieces were very robust at this point, there was little or no warpage or slumping, and they could be handled and even abraded to shape the pieces and to remove asperities and any adherent solid resulting from the exuded liquid. The dried, solid-filled cylindrical sponge pieces were arrayed in a rectangular alumina crucible (2\ufffd\u2033 W\ufffd6\u2033 L\u05fd\u2033 D) and placed in a furnace preheated to 500\ufffd C. The furnace temperature was ramped at 40\ufffd C./minute to 800\ufffd C. and held at 800\ufffd C. for 45 minutes. The resultant cylindrical white porous inorganic sponge samples were robust and exhibited strengths qualitatively similar to those attained from the fully dried gelatin-treated samples prepared as described in Example 52., 47295=In accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention, methods are provided for the restoration of bony tissue. In this regard, an area of bony tissue requiring repair as a result of disease, injury, desired reconfiguration and the like, is identified and preferably measured. A block of porous calcium phosphate material can be made to fit the dimensions of the missing or damaged bony tissue and implanted in place by itself or in conjunction with biocompatible bonding material compositions such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,872 issued in the name of E. M. Erbe on Oct. 28, 1997 and incorporated herein by reference. The calcium phosphate material can also be used as a \u201csleeve\u201d or form for other implants, as a containment vessel for the bone grafting material which is introduced into the sleeve for the repair, and in many other contexts., 69329=It is preferred that the overall porosity of materials prepared in accordance with this invention be high. This characteristic is measured by pore volume, expressed as a percentage. Zero percent pore volume refers to a fully dense material, which, perforce, has no pores at all. One hundred percent pore volume cannot meaningfully exist since the same would refer to \u201call pores\u201d or air. Persons skilled in the art understand the concept of pore volume, however and can easily calculate and apply it. For example, pore volume may be determined in accordance with W. D. Kingery, Introduction to Ceramics, 1960 p. 416 (Wiley, 1060), who provides a formula for determination of porosity. Expressing porosity as a percentage yields pore volume. The formula is: Pore Volume=(1\u2212fp) 100%, where fp is fraction of theoretical density achieved., 152150=Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using a Nicolet model 5DXC instrument (Nicolet Instrument Co., 5225 Verona Rd. Madison, Wis. 53744) run in the diffuse reflectance mode over the range of 400 to 4000 cm\u22121. The presence of the carbonated form of HAp is confirmed by the FTIR spectra, which indicated the presence of peaks characteristic of [PO4]\u22123 (580-600, 950-1250 cm\u22121) and of [CO3]\u22122 (880, 1400, & 1450 cm\u22121). The P=O stretch, indicated by the strong peak at 1150-1250 cm\u22121, suggests a structural perturbation of hydroxyapatite by the carbonate ion., 216995=An aqueous solution of 14.36 g of 50 wt. % H3PO2 was diluted with 5.00 g distilled water to form a clear, colorless solution contained in a 250 ml fluoropolymer resin beaker on a hotplate/magnetic stirrer. Added to this solution was 41.66 g yttrium nitrate hexahydrate salt, Y(NO3)3\u20146H2O (Alfa/Aesar reagent #12898, CAS #13494-98-9), equivalent to 23.21 wt % Y. The molar ratio of the Y/P in this mixture was 1/1 and the equivalent solids level (as YPO4) was 32.8 wt %. Endothermic dissolution of the yttrium nitrate hexahydrate salt proceeded with gradual warming of the reaction mixture, eventually forming a clear, homogeneous colorless solution at room temperature. Heating of this solution with constant agitation to approximately 75\ufffd C. initiated a vigorous endothermic reaction which resulted in the evolution of NOx (g), rapid temperature increase of the sample to approximately >100\ufffd C., and finally, formation of a pasty white mass. Heat treatment of the pasty solid and subsequent X-ray diffraction analysis of the fired solid were conducted as described in Example 1. Results of the XRD analysis are as follows:, 213647=An aqueous solution of 11.04 g of 50 wt. % H3PO2 was diluted with 5.00 g distilled water to form a clear, colorless solution contained in a 250 ml fluoropolymer resin beaker on a hotplate/magnetic stirrer. Added to this solution was 36.66 g neodymium nitrate hexahydrate salt, Nd(NO3)3-6H2O (Alfa/Aesar reagent #12912, CAS #16454-60-7equivalent to 32.90 wt % Nd. The molar ratio of the Nd/P in this mixture was 1/1 and the equivalent solids level (as NdPO4) was 38.0 wt. %. Endothermic dissolution of the neodymium nitrate hexahydrate salt proceeded with gradual warming of the reaction mixture, eventually forming a clear, homogeneous lavender solution at room temperature. Heating of this solution with constant agitation to approximately 70\ufffd C. initiated a vigorous endothermic reaction which resulted in the evolution of NOx (g), rapid temperature increase of the sample to approximately 100\ufffd C., and finally, formation of a pasty lavender mass. Heat treatment of the pasty solid and subsequent X-ray diffraction analysis of the fired solid were conducted as described in Example 1. Results of the analysis are as follows:, 273571=A reactant solution was prepared by combining 7.88 g 50 wt. % hypophosphorous acid, H3PO2, with 5.00 g deionized water in a 250 ml Pyrex beaker. To this solution was added 22.51 g calcium nitrate tetrahydrate salt, Ca(NO3)2.4H2O; plus 0.33 g sodium nitrate salt, NaNO3 (Fisher Certified ACS reagent #S343-500, CAS #7631-99-4), equivalent to 27.05 wt. % Na; plus 0.74 g magnesium nitrate hexahydrate salt, Mg(NO3)2-6H2O (Alfa/Aesar reagent #11564, CAS 13446-18-9), equivalent to 9.48 wt. % Mg; plus 0.046 g Zn(NO3)2.6H2O (ACS reagent, Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. #22,873-7, CAS 10196-18-6), equivalent to 21.97 wt. % Zn. Endothermic dissolution of the salts proceeded with stirring and gradual warming on a laboratory hot plate to approximately 20\ufffd C., eventually forming a homogeneous solution with a water-like viscosity despite the high salt concentration. The equivalent solids level (as cation substituted hydroxyapatite) was 27.39 wt. % and the target solid composition was 38.19 wt. % Ca, 0.90 wt. % Na, 0.70 wt. % Mg, 0.10 wt. % Zn, 56.72 wt. % PO4, and 3.39 wt. % OH., 85725=In accordance with other embodiments of the invention, the shaped bodies produced hereby may be comminuted to yield highly useful and unique powder materials finding wide utility. Thus, shaped bodies may be crushed, milled, etc. and preferably classified or measured, such as with a light scattering instrument, to give rise to fine powders. Such powders are very small and highly uniform, both in size, shape and chemical composition. Particles may be prepared having particle size number means less than about 0.1 \u03bcm or 100 nanometers. Smaller mean sized may also be attained. Thus, this invention provides highly uniform inorganic materials in powder form having particle sizes, measured by light scattering techniques such that the number mean size is between about 0.1 and 5.0 \u03bcm. Particle sizes between about 0.5 and 2.0 \u03bcm may also be attained. Other embodiments may be obtained where the particle (or nanoparticles) have a crystallite size less than 1 \u03bcm (1 \u03bcm=1000 nanometers), preferably about less than 100 nm. It may, in some embodiments, be desired to classify the powders in order to improve uniformity of size., 96284=Controlled precipitation of specific phases from aqueous solutions containing metal cations and phosphate anions represents a difficult technical challenge. For systems containing calcium and phosphate ions, the situation is further complicated by the multiplicity of phases that may be involved in the crystallization reactions as well as by the facile phase transformations that may proceed during mineralization. The solution chemistry in aqueous systems containing calcium and phosphate species has been scrupulously investigated as a function of pH, temperature, concentration, anion character, precipitation rate, digestion time, etc. (P.
