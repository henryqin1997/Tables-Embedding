            "Raw velo suggests potential plus-plus offering; sat comfortably in the 94-97 range through entire start; worked 96-98 in final inning of work; velo is legit; command is well below average; struggles to finish delivery and releases high and arm side; struggled to work down with the fastball; pitch lacked movement; firm and flat above the belt; plus pitch at present on the merits of the near elite velocity but overall grade is pulled down by 30 grade command and fringe movement. Should be dominating pitch but it plays down.",
            "Snapped off his first sexy slider in the fifth; preceding offerings missed glove side and lacked bite; at its best, showed power curve movement with good vertical snap; lacked big tilt but showed above-average potential because of the late vertical drop and ability to play off fastball; inconsistent in this start and was not a true wipeout pitch.",
            "Small sample; too firm and flat in the upper 80s; wasn't turning it over; worked up and lost action; more deliberate in the delivery on CH; more 1B-side fall off; didn't show much feel for the pitch in the start; dropped one that flashed above average; hard to project plus pitch given his struggles to finish in the delivery and encourage arm-side/sinking action.",
            "Short cutter; small sample; one finished over the plate at 88 resulting in a single; the rest missed glove side; was hard to tell if cutting action was deliberately induced or if extension was cut in the delivery; could be effective pitch given velocity and glove-side wiggle."
