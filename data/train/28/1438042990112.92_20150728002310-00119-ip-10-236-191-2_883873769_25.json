Is Justin Worley the quarterback for this team or will a freshman make his debut? Regardless of who is the quarterback can this team generate more big plays. The Vols have just 11 plays of 20 yards or more this season. That's one splash play per 24 offensive snaps. Butch Jones it's been a competition week as the first year head man has challenged his team noting starting jobs were on the line in an effort to get his team to prepare this week as they did a week ago in their SEC season opener at Florida. Saturday Tennessee returns to the confines of Neyland Stadium as they step out of conference to host (2-1) South Alabama.

    "textAfterTable": "Slot receiver Pig Howard is a week healthier and Howard's return last week helped the offense as the he had 75 yards and a touchdown on four catches. Worley is expected to be the starter and his challenge all we has been to be more decisive with the football. \"I have to trust my eyes more. I have to trust what I'm seeing post snap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Worley explained. \"You always get a pre-snap look at everything, but things change after the snap. So I have to get a post-snap confirmation of what the defense is doing and trust what I'm seeing. \"I think it's more being late with the ball and potentially being behind the receiver with the ball and things like that.\" Defensively, the Vols are showing growth. Veterans Marlon Walls and Corey Miller are playing the best ball of their careers. Youth is developing in defensive backs Cameron Sutton and Devaun Swafford. Then there is the arrival of defensive end Corey Vereen who certainly made a quick impression on everyone in 7 snaps in the Swamp. This week as the Jaguars come to Knoxville, the defense's challenge is to continue an offense that features mobility at the quarterback position. Something that John Jancek's group didn't do a good job of a week ago as Florida back up Tyler Murphy rushed for 84 yards on 10 carries. The Vol defense will again be challenged in the middle of the football field.",
