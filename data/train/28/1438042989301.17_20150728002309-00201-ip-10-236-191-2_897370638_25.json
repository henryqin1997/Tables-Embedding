This seems to be a steal compared to other schools., 286044=At the low rate they have, this is the best choice! Five classes (a full time load) is less than $2000. Most of the professors are hard but they are more than fair. One of them once told me It's best to fail in here than out there., 698509=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 364302=I'm an online student, and I feel like I don't always get the help and info I need when calling the school or emailing. I cannot go into the campus because I am in North Carolina. It took 3 weeks for them to get my book order correct, and because of that I had to start my math class a week late. I have been in school for about 6 months now, and have recently been told I will not be able to start the program I am interested in until august 2013 ANOTHER YEAR FROM NOW!!! That is really discouraging and upsetting.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Danielle from South Pasadena, FL 03/09/2011 Reviewer is A current student here. 4 out of 5 people found this review useful. 2 of 173 Categories Comments Great for these types of students St Petersburg College is great for all students. They have wonderful advisors if you are new and need help with things such as financial aid and scheduling classes. They are also great for the seasoned college student who would rather take charge of their own academics. They also offer a huge variety of online courses for the working student. Tips for prospective students St Petersburg College is a great school. Most students only come for their A.A. degrees and go somewhere else for a Bachelors, however I highly recommend their 4 year programs. They have a variety of majors to choose from and their faculty is exceptional. Bang for the buck Because it's not a university St Petersburg College is much more affordable and accessible (they have 9 different campuses) for students who don't have the financial backing to attend a brand",
