Also disclosed are the use of such a material for stiffening or reinforcing components as well as an extruded or injection-molded article made of such a material. 20110301255 10-20-2011 EPOXIDE-BASED STRUCTURAL FOAM HAVING IMPROVED TENACITY - Disclosed is a thermally expandable and curable material containing: 20110257285 Published Description Patent application number Thomas Engels, Duesseldorf DE 04-24-2014 POSITION-DETERMINING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THE OPERATION THEREOF - A system for determining position comprises at least one transmitter connected to the object, at least two stationary receivers, and means for determining the phase difference with which the signal of the transmitter arrives at the two receivers. Compared to conventional radio direction finding (decca direction finding), transmission takes place only at the location of the mobile object. This has the effect that only one transmitter having very small dimensions and very low power consumption is required at the location of the mobile object. At least one pair of two stationary receivers is used for operation to determine at least one space coordinate of the object position, the",
