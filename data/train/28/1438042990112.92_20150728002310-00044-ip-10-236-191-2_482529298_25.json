Finally, the addition of a route guidance system as described in other patents becomes even more feasible since the exact location of a destination can be determined. The system can be configured so that a vehicle operator could enter a phone number, for example, or an address and the vehicle would be automatically and safely driven to that location. Since the system knows the location of the edge of every roadway, very little, if any, operator intervention would be required. Even a cell phone number can be used if the cell phone has the SnapTrack GPS location system as soon to be provided by Qualcomm., 98945=[0068] K.

Such information could be obtained by road sensors and then transmitted to all vehicles in the area by a permanently installed system as disclosed above and in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/079,065 filed Feb. 19, 2002, incorporated by reference herein. Alternately, there have been recent studies that show that icing conditions on road surfaces, for example, can be accurately predicted by local meteorological stations and broadcast to vehicles in the area. If such a system is not present, then, the best place to measure road friction is at the road surface and not on the vehicle. The vehicle requires advance information of an icing condition in order to have time to adjust its speed or take other evasive action. The same road based or local meteorological transmitter system could be used to warn the operators of traffic conditions, construction delays etc. and to set the local speed limit. Naturally once one vehicle in an area has discovered an icing condition, for example, this information can be immediately transmitted to all equipped vehicles through the vehicle to vehicle communication system discussed above., 102540=[0076] \u201cThe U.S. government has designated its GPS the \u201cNAVSTAR.\u201d The NAVSTAR GPS is expected to be declared fully operational by the U.S. government in 1993. The government of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) is engaged in the development of a GPS known as \u201cGLONASS\u201d. Further, two European systems known as \u201cNAVSAT\u2019 and \u201cGRANAS\u201d are also under development. For ease of discussion, the following disclosure focuses specifically on the NAVSTAR GPS. The invention, however, has equal applicability to other global positioning systems., 72048=[0029] Reading through the remainder of the DOT Performance Plan FY 2000, one is impressed by the billions of dollars that are being spent to solve the highway safety problem coupled with the enormous improvement that has been made until the last few years. It can also be observed that the increase in benefits from these expenditures has now disappeared. For example, the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled fell from 5.5 to 1.7 in the period from the mid-1960s to 1994. But this decrease has now substantially stopped! This is an example of the law of diminishing returns and signals the need to take a totally new approach to solving this problem., 281927=[0294] The Local Area Augmented System (LAAS) is also being deployed in addition to the WAAS system to provide even greater coverage for the areas surrounding major airports. According to Newsletter of the Institute of Navigation, 1997, \u201cthe FAA's schedule for (LAAS) for Category II and III precision instrument approaches calls for development of standards by 1998 that will be sufficient to complete a prototype system by 2001. The next step will be to work out standards for an operational system to be fielded in about 2005, that could serve nationwide up to about 200 runways for Cat II-III approaches.\u201d, 318709=[0350] 11.

The total cost of implementing this plan is minuscule compared to the numbers stated above.

DSRC could be used for inter-vehicle communications, however, its range according to the ITS proposal to the Federal Government would be limited to about 90 meters although there have been recent proposals to extend this to about 1000 meters. Also, there may be a problem with interference from toll collection systems, etc. According to this reference, however, \u201cit is likely that any widespread deployment of intersection collision avoidance or automated highways would utilize DSRC\u201d. Ultra wide band communication systems, on the other hand, are a viable alternative to DSRC as explained below. The DSRC physical layer uses microwaves in the 902 to 928 megahertz band. However, ITS America submitted a petition to the FCC seeking to use the 5.85 to 5.925 gigahertz band for DSRC applications., 319443=[0353] 14. K. A. Lukin, V. A. Rakityansky.

The neural network is trained based on how a driver drives the vehicle given the output from a video camera. The output of the neural network is the direction that the vehicle should head based on the input information from the video camera and the training based on what a good driver would do. Such a system can be used in some embodiments of the present invention to guide a vehicle to a safe stop in the event that the driver becomes incapacitated or some other emergency situation occurs wherein the driver is unable to control the vehicle. The input to the neural network in this case would be the map information rather than a video camera. Additionally, the laser radar imaging system of this invention could also be an input to the system. This neural network system can additionally take over in the event that an accident becomes inevitable. Simple neural networks are probably not sufficient for this purpose and neural fuzzy and modular neural networks are probably required., 427132=[0546] In some locations where weather conditions can deteriorate and degrade road surface conditions, various infrastructure-based sensors can be placed either in or adjacent to the road surface. Subsystem 88 is designed to interrogate and obtained information from such road-based systems. An example of such a system would be an RFID tag containing a temperature sensor. This device may be battery-powered or, preferably, would receive its power from the vehicle-mounted interrogator, or other host vehicle-mounted source, as the vehicle passes nearby the device. In this manner, the vehicle can obtain the temperature of the road surface and receive advanced warning when the temperature is approaching conditions which could cause icing of the roadway, for example. An RFID based on a surface acoustic wave (SAW) device is one preferred example of such a sensor, see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/079,065 filed Feb. 19, 2002, incorporated by reference herein. An infrared sensor on the vehicle can also be used to determine the road temperature and the existence of ice or snow., 73475=[0032] A primary goal of the Intelligent Vehicle Initiative was to reduce highway related fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled from 1.7 in 1996 to 1.6 in 2000. Of course, the number of fatalities may still increase due to increased road use. If this reduction in fatalities comes about due to slower travel speeds, because of greater congestion, then has anything really been accomplished? Similar comments apply to the goal of reducing the rate of injury per 100 million vehicle miles from 141 in 1996 to 128 in 2000. An alternate goal is to have the technology implemented on all new vehicles by the year 2010 that will eventually eliminate all fatalities and injuries. As an intermediate milestone, it is proposed to have the technology implemented on all new vehicles by 2007 to reduce or eliminate fatalities caused by road departure, yellow line crossing, stop sign infraction, rear end and excessive speed accidents. Inventions described herein will explain how these are goals can be attained., 48888=[0002] This application is related to, on the grounds that it includes common subject matter, U.S. patent application Ser.

Since there may be as many as 100 to 1000 vehicles simultaneously transmitting within radio range of the receiving vehicle, a transmitting vehicle must have a code which can be known to the receiving vehicle. One preferred technique is to make this identification code a function of the GPS coordinate location of transmitting vehicle. The code would need to be coarse enough so that information to be transmitted by transmitting vehicle is accomplished before the transmitting vehicle changes its identification. If this information consists of a position and velocity of the transmitting vehicle, then the receiving vehicle can determine the new transmitting code of the transmitting vehicle., 97478=[0065] F. van Diggelen, \u201cGPS and GPS+GLONASS RTK\u201d, ION-GPS, September 1997 \u201cNew Products Descriptions\u201d, gives a good background of real time kinematic systems using the carrier frequency. The products described in this paper illustrate the availability of centimeter level accuracies for the purposes of the RtZF\u2122 system. The product described in F. van Diggelen requires a base station that is no further than 20 kilometers away., 277345=[0284] Using the CNET commercial system, 1 foot accuracies are possible if base stations are no more than 30 miles from the vehicle unit. This would require approximately 1000 base stations to cover CONUS. Alternately, the same accuracy is obtainable if the vehicle can become its own DGPS system every 30 miles as described herein., 275732=[0281] A type of wide area DGPS (WADGPS) system has been developed spans the entire US continent which provides position RMS accuracy to better than 50 cm. This system is described in the Bertiger, et al, \u201cA Prototype Real-Time Wide Area Differential GPS System,\u201d Proceedings of the National Technical Meeting, Navigation and Positioning in the Information Age, Institute of Navigation, Jan. 14-16, 1997 pp. 645-655. A RMS error of 50 cm would be marginally accurate for RtZF\u2122. Many of the teachings of this invention, especially if the road edge and lane location error were much less, could be accomplished using more accurate surveying equipment. The OmniSTAR system is another WADGPS system that claims 6 cm (1\u03c3) accuracy., 146070=[0150] According to a paper by Kelly, Robert, Povich, Doublas and Poole, Katherine entitled \u201cPetition of Intelligent Transportation Society of America for Amendment Of The Commission's Rules to Add Intelligent Transportation Services (ITS) As A New Mobile Service With Co-Primary Status In The 5.850 to 5.925 GHz\u201d, from 1989 to 1993 police received an annual average of over 6.25 million vehicle accident reports. During this same period, the total comprehensive cost to the nation of motor vehicle accidents exceeded the annual average of 400 billion dollars. In 1987 alone, Americans lost over 2 billion hours (approximately 22,800 years) sitting in traffic jams. Each driver in Washington D.C. wastes an average of 70 hours per year idling in traffic. From 1986 to 1996, car travel has increased almost 40% which amounts to about a 3.4% increase per year., 95136=[0063] The following quote is from Y. M. Al-Haifi et al., \u201cPerformance Evaluation of GPS Single-Epoch On-the Fly Ambiguity Resolution\u201d, Journal of the Institute of Navigation, Vol. 44, No. 4, Winter 1997-1998. This technique demonstrates sub-centimeter precision results all of the time provided that at least five satellites are available and multipath errors are small. A resolution of 0.001 cycles is not at all unusual for geodetic GPS receivers. This leads to a resolution on the order of 0.2 millimeters. In practice, multipath affects, usually from nearby surfaces, limit the accuracy achievable to around 5 millimeters. It is currently the case that the reference receiver can be located within a few kilometers of the mobile receiver. In this case, most of the other GPS error sources are common. The only major problem, which needs to be solved to carry out high precision kinematic GPS, is the integer ambiguity problem. This is because at any given instant, the whole number of cycles between the satellite and the receiver is unknown. The recovery of the unknown whole wavelengths or integer ambiguities is therefore of great importance to precise phase positioning. Recently, a large amount of research has focused on so called on the fly (OTF) ambiguity resolution methodologies in which the integer ambiguities are solved for while the unknown receiver is in motion.\u201d, 319726=[0354] 15.

Proc. of ISSSE, Paris, September 1-4, pp. 454-457, 1992;, 85054=[0050] \u201cRecently, certain experimental integrated vehicular dynamic guidance systems have been proposed. Motorola has disclosed an Intelligent Vehicle Highway System in block diagram form in copyright dated 1993 brochure. Delco Electronics has disclosed another Intelligent Vehicle Highway System also in block diagram form in Automotive News published on Apr. 12, 1993. These systems use compass technology for vehicular positioning. However, displacement wheel sensors are plagued by tire slippage, tire wear and are relatively inaccurate requiring recalibration of the current position. Compasses are inexpensive, but suffer from drifting particularly when driving on a straight road for extended periods. Compasses can sense turns, and the system may then be automatically recalibrated to the current position based upon sensing a turn and correlating that turn to the nearest turn on a digitized map, but such recalibration, is still prone to errors during excessive drifts. Moreover, digitized map systems with the compass and wheel sensor positioning methods operate in two dimensions on a three dimensional road terrain injecting further errors between the digitized map position and the current vehicular position due to a failure to sense the distance traveled in the vertical dimension.\u201d, 141283=[0142] The DGPS correction information can be broadcast over the radio data system (RDS) via FM transmitters for land use. A company called Differential Correction, Inc. has come up with a technique to transmit this DGPS information on the RDS channel. This technique has been used in Europe since 1994 and, in particular, Sweden has launched a nationwide DPGS service via the RDS (see, Sjoberg, Lars, \u201cA \u20181 Meter\u2019 Satellite Based Navigation Solutions for the Mobile Environment That Already Are Available Throughout Europe\u201d). This system has the potential of providing accuracies on the premium service of between about 1 and 2 meters. A 1 meter accuracy, coupled with the carrier phase system to be described below, provides an accuracy substantially better than about 1 meter as preferred in the Road to Zero Fatalities\u2122 (RtZF\u2122) system of this invention., 93906=[0061] According to the paper by R. Braff, titled \u201cDescription of the FAA's Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS)\u201d, Journal of the Institute of Navigation, Vol. 44, No. 4, Winter 1997-1998, the LAAS System is the FAA's ground-based augmentation system for local area differential GPS. It is based on providing corrections of errors that are common to both ground-based and aircraft receivers. These corrections are transmitted to the user receivers via very high frequency (VHF), line of sight radio broadcast. LAAS has the capability of providing accuracy on the order of 1 meter or better on the final approach segment and through rollout. LAAS broadcasts navigational information in a localized service volume within approximately 30 nautical miles of the LAAS ground segment., 106934=[0086] \u201cFor a more detailed discussion on the NAVSTAR GPS, see Parkinson, Bradford W. and Gilbert, Stephen W., \u201cNAVSTAR: Global Positioning System\u2014Ten Years Later, \u201cProceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 71, No. 10, October 1983; and GPS: A Guide to the Next Utility, published by Trimble Navigation Ltd., Sunnyvale, Calif, 1989, pp. 147, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. For a detailed discussion of a vehicle positioning/navigation system which uses the NAVSTAR GPS, see commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/628,560, entitled \u201cVehicle Position Determination System and Method,\u201d filed Dec. 3, 1990, which is incorporated herein by reference.\u201d, 99167=[0069] Significant additional improvement can be obtained for the WAAS system using the techniques described in the paper \u201cIncorporation of orbital dynamics to improve wide-area differential GPS\u201d by J. Ceva, W. Bertinger, R. Mullerschoen, T. Yunck and B. Parkinson, Institute on Navigation, Meeting on GPS Technology, Palm Springs, Calif., September 1995, which is incorporated herein by reference., 92462=[0059] From a paper by J. F. Zumberge, M. M. Watkins and F. H. Webb, titled \u201cCharacteristics and Applications of Precise GPS Clock Solutions Every 30 Seconds\u201d, Journal of the Institute of Navigation, Vol. 44, No. 4, Winter 1997-1998, it appears that by using the techniques described in this reference, the WAAS system could eventually be improved to provide accuracies in the sub-decimeter range for moving vehicles without the need for other DGPS systems. This data would be provided every 30 seconds., 75259=[0034] On Jul. 15, 1998, the IVI light vehicle steering committee met and recommended that the IVI program should be conducted as a government industry partnership like the PNGV. This is believed to be quite wrong and it is believed that the IVI should now move vigorously toward the deployment of proven technology., 382967=[0455] Another enhancement that would be possible with dedicated satellites and/or earth bound pseudolites results from the greater control over the information transmitted than is available from the present GPS system. Recognizing that this system could save in excess of 40,000 lives per year in the U.S. alone, the cost of deploying such special purpose stations can easily be justified. For example, say there exists a modulated wave that is 10000 kilometers long, another one which is 1000 km long etc. down to 1 cm. It would then be easy to determine the absolute distance from one point to the other. The integer ambiguity of RTK DGPS would be eliminated. Other types of modulation are of course possible to achieve the desired result of simply eliminating the carrier integer uncertainty that is discussed in many U.S. patents and other literature. This is not meant to be a recommendation but to illustrate that once the decision has been made to provide information to every vehicle that will permit it to always know its location within 10 cm, many technologies will be there to make it happen. The cost savings resulting from eliminating fatalities and serious injuries will easily cover the cost of such technologies many times over. The provision of additional frequencies can also enhance the system and render differential corrections unnecessary. Each frequency from a satellite is diffracted differently by the ionosphere. The properties of the ionosphere can thus be determined if multiple frequencies are transmitted. This will partially be achieved with the launch of the European Galileo GPS satellite system in combination with the US GPS system., 317446=[0345] 6. A. A. Mogyla.

The processor may be constructed or programmed to analyze the received noise signals in order to determine whether any received noise signals originate from transmitters within a pre-determined distance from the vehicle. Such analysis can be based on an initial portion of the noise signals, i.e., the processor can scan through multiple the noise signals reading only the initial part of each to assess which noise signal(s) is/are particularly important and then obtain and, process only those of interest. [0663] Also disclosed above is a method for transferring information between a vehicle and a transmitter which comprises the steps of transmitting a unique pseudorandom noise signal by the transmitter in a carrier-less fashion composed of frequencies within a pre-selected band, encoding information in the noise signal relating to an identification of the transmitter and a position of the transmitter and providing",
