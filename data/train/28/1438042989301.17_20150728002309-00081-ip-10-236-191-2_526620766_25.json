    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{15900=Our Studios business has shown particularly strong growth in 2011. Total ITVS revenues grew 10% from \u00a3554 million to \u00a3612 million, driven primarily by international production. External revenues were up 9% to \u00a3320 million. This revenue growth has more than offset the investment made in creative renewal, enabling EBITA before exceptional items to rise \u00a32 million to \u00a383 million during the year., 55836=Awards 2011/12, 22579=2011 was the first full year of the pay HD channels ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4 on the Sky platform, and they performed in line with our expectations. In early 2012 we signed archive video on demand (VOD) deals with Lovefilm and Netflix and a VOD and catch up deal with Sky. These are non-exclusive deals which enable us to retain the option of doing similar deals with other parties should opportunities arise. We will also be launching a pay version of ITV Player later this year, which we will start to test internally in the second quarter of 2012. While this is slightly later than originally anticipated, we want to guarantee the quality of the user experience before launching to the public., 12068=We have increased our co-production activity as well: in 2011, we co-produced Julian Fellowes' Titanic which has now been sold into 86 countries ahead of its screening in April to coincide with the centenary of the Titanic's disaster; we also co-produced Prime Suspect in the US with Universal Television for NBC, which was sold into 116 countries. In 2012 we will be co-producing Mrs Biggs, a drama about Ronnie Biggs' wife, with Seven Network in Australia., 78549=Mary Fagan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 020 7157 3965 or 07736 786448 Mike Large\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 020 7157 3021 or 07768 261528, 16785=Creative renewal lies at the heart of our strategy to build an international content business. 2011 saw a significant increase in our development budget and the number of new pilots created. This contributed to ITV Studios (ITVS) securing 111 new commissions in the year (up 28% compared to 2010), of which 66 were in the UK and 45 were international., 55462=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three Royal Television Society Awards including X Factor for Best Entertainment Show, Ant & Dec for Best Entertainment Performance (I'm a Celebrity) and the Road to Coronation Street for Best Single Drama., 33337=Our performance relative to the market is an important metric for us and this is reflected in our share of broadcast (SOB) - one of our key performance indicators. ITV Family net advertising revenue (NAR) was up 1% in 2011, ahead of the television advertising market for the fourth consecutive year, with SOB increasing from 45.1% to 45.3%. This outperformance was driven by an improved second half performance as advertisers concentrated spend around our autumn schedule of sport, drama and entertainment., 55741=The high quality of the content we produce and the programming we make famous on our channels has been recognised by many industry awards during 2011, including:, 27925=Television is a long-term business and Peter Fincham and his team continue to make plans for the schedule several years in advance. In 2011, we spent just over \u00a31 billion on programming and we continue to ensure that our programming investment is made as efficiently as possible, while maintaining variety and quality. Our programme budget for 2012 will remain at around \u00a31 billion - we believe this is a sufficient level to provide the breadth, variety and freshness that audiences and advertisers require. We recently secured c.\u00a335 million of savings from 2013 onwards when we renegotiated a number of rights deals including the Champions' League and FA Cup. Some of these savings may be reinvested back into the schedule., 33710=Although we delivered significant growth in non-NAR revenues in 2011, we still have a high degree of reliance on advertising revenues. We therefore remain firmly focused on maximising our audience and revenue share from our free-to-air broadcast business., 51609=Focus for 2012, 48096=\u2022 ITV programme budget confirmed at c.\u00a31bn for 2012, 71108=The Directors' Report is prepared in line with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006. In preparing the Directors' Report the Company has had regard to the guidance issued by the Accounting Standards Board in its Reporting Statement on narrative reporting. The Directors' Report is intended to provide shareholders with a greater understanding of the Company, of its position in the markets within which it operates, and of its prospects., 6301=Our total programming budget for 2012 will be around \u00a31 billion, of which around \u00a3800 million will be spent on the ITV1 NPB, as we work to improve the variety of the schedule across the year. Schedule costs in the first half will increase due to Euro 2012 in June., 57082=We are also encouraged by the prospects for our free-to-air television business given current trends within the market. As we approach the end of analogue switch-off in the UK, the impact of fragmentation on audiences has already largely been felt. The daily average number of minutes of television watched has been rising in the UK in recent years, reaching record levels in 2010, and was broadly flat year-on-year in 2011 at 4 hours 2 minutes.\u00a0 Live viewing via television sets is still around the same level as it was in 2004, but viewing via other devices is\u00a0 growing. This suggests that VOD viewing to date has been incremental.\u00a0, 2004=Although ITV Family NAR has started the year better than we expected, it is still down 2% in Q1 and, whilst we expect to outperform the market again in 2012, we remain cautious on the full year outlook for the television advertising market., 42907=\u2022 111 new commissions in 2011, 46214=\u2022 376m long form video views in 2011, up 44%, 29021=Our channel brands are increasingly important in the constantly evolving digital market. Those channels linked to a strong 'mother brand' (ITV, BBC, C4, C5 and Sky) have recorded growth in SOV this year while other independent digital channels have seen a marked 9% decline. To consolidate this strength and build upon it we will be rebranding all of our channels during the second half of 2012 to position them for the challenges and opportunities which lie ahead., 20048=The SDN business, which operates one of the six digital terrestrial multiplex licences in the UK that make up Freeview, saw 37% growth in its revenues as a result of the renegotiation of a number of its licences in 2010. This revenue growth will not be repeated in 2011 as this was a one-off increase., 59985=We have made progress across the business and against virtually all of our key performance indicators in 2011. We saw a solid performance on-screen, with ITV Family share of viewing (SOV) up by 1% in 2011 and the digital channels continuing to show strong growth with SOV up 10%. ITV1 SOV, which benefited from the successful launch of ITV1+1, was down 2%, and ITV Family share of commercial impacts (SOCI) was down 1% but we will continue to work to improve these performances.\u00a0\u00a0, 3184=Our 2011 financial and operating results demonstrate the progress we are making and the momentum we have built up. We will increasingly look to content, pay and online as engines for growth in the UK and internationally as we invest further in our key strategic priorities. Everyone at ITV remains firmly focused on delivering the Transformation Plan and we remain on track to do so., 23896=Online revenues grew by 21% in 2011 to \u00a334 million, which contributed to the 13% growth in non-NAR revenues within Broadcasting and Online to \u00a3310 million (2010: \u00a3275 million). While this represents encouraging growth we are still aware of the need to build scale within Online. Our challenge is to choose the best monetisation strategy for our content and to continue to innovate, to open up new revenue streams., 20639=These all represent encouraging trends in our engagement with consumers but our challenge is to monetise the audiences we now have across multiple platforms. We have invested in fixing our online technology platform in 2011 but still have some way to go and the quality and the performance of ITV Player will further improve. We will continue to invest in navigation, ease of use, content and robustness to improve the quality of the overall user experience on our website., 63162=Whilst the Company is focused on annual performance targets we are making investments in people, content and technology for the long term value of the business. Although the Transformation Plan is being delivered against the context of a complex regulatory environment for UK broadcasting, we do not see regulation as a barrier to delivery of the strategy and we have started discussions with Ofcom and the Government about the ITV Channel 3 licences, the current terms of which end in 2014., 46049=\u2022 9% of VOD viewing in December on mobile, 8178=In 2012 we will look to build on the momentum we have created. In 2011 we invested \u00a328 million in ITVS, Online, technology and our digital channels, and in 2012 we expect to invest a further \u00a325 million., 77222=for the year ended 31 December 2011, 82090=ITV plc (the 'Company') released its preliminary announcement of annual results for the year ended 31 December 2011 ('Preliminary Announcement') on 2 March 2012. Further to the Preliminary Announcement, the Company can now confirm that the Report and Accounts 2011, Notice of Annual General Meeting and Form of Proxy will be mailed to shareholders on 29 March 2012. The Report and Accounts 2012 are now available on the Company's website at www.itvplc.com/investors, 40137=Our people remain key to ITV and to the delivery of the Transformation Plan. Our management team have now been in place for over a year and, together with the wider leadership team, are driving the Transformation Plan forward and continuing to facilitate cultural change at all levels of the business. We are very pleased to see that our employees are embracing the changes, with engagement having risen to 85% in 2011 (2010: 75%). We have also brought our recruitment operation in-house and the team have launched a brand new careers website to ensure we continue to attract and retain the best talent., 14808=Our strategy revolves around creating long-running, returnable drama and entertainment formats which travel well internationally, so recommission levels are also a key focus for us. 75 recommissions in the UK, including Vera, Lewis and a celebrity version of The Chase, relative to 57 in 2010, represent positive steps in this area as we build up our pipeline of content., 78980=Pippa Foulds\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 020 7157 6555 or 07778 031097, 15356=Our new UK commissions for ITV1 include SWAGS (a six-part drama about service wives and girlfriends), Superstar (in collaboration with Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber) which will be screened in 2012, and Mr Selfridge (a ten-part drama about the life of the flamboyant American entrepreneur, Harry Gordon Selfridge) for 2013. We also had ten off-ITV commissions including The Devil's Dinner Party for Sky Atlantic and Dirk Gently for BBC., 81050=The Company's 2012 Annual General Meeting will be held at 11.00 a.m. on Wednesday, 9 May 2012 at The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, London SW1P 3EE.\u00a0\u00a0 The Notice of Annual General Meeting and Form of proxy will be available on our website from 29 March 2012., 80200=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notice of 2012 Annual General Meeting, 37263=The move of the Company's Manchester base from Quay Street to MediaCity is now well under way and will deliver a bespoke, state-of-the-art production facility for Coronation Street as well as providing modern offices for everyone working in Manchester with improved technology. The first move for staff in Manchester into the new site will take place later this year. We will also be moving all staff in Leeds to one site and modernising a number of our regional offices with HD studios. As a result of our investment in technology and property, there is expected to be an increase in capital expenditure in 2012 to \u00a370-\u00a380 million., 32294=ITV Family share of commercial impacts (SOCI) was down 1% in 2011 with ITV1 Adult SOCI down 4%, although we saw stronger performances from many of our key sub-demographics (Housewives, Adult ABC1s, 16-34s) which have a bearing on the contract rights renewal mechanism. Our digital channels' SOCI was again strong, up 9%., 28438=In December, Ofcom announced that it would not be referring the advertising trading model to the Competition Commission. While our strategy is not dependent upon regulatory relief, we welcomed this decision as we had always maintained that a lengthy market review, at a time of such rapid change and increasing competition, would not be beneficial for UK consumers or the UK television industry., 6696=In 2012, we aim to repeat the performance of 2011 by outperforming the television advertising market, as we did in 2011, and hold ITV Family SOV. We will refresh and enhance all of our channel brands and continue to invest in brand defining content as efficiently as possible., 30075=Our digital channels continue to perform very strongly. ITV2 and ITV3 remain the largest digital channels in the UK and saw SOV rise 8% and 11% respectively, while ITV4 saw a 13% rise in SOV making it one of the fastest growing digital channels. ITV2, which won Channel of the Year and Best Entertainment Channel at the Broadcast Digital Awards, has seen particular success with the BAFTA award-winning The Only Way is Essex (TOWIE) and Celebrity Juice, both of which will be returning in 2012. TOWIE averaged 1.8 million viewers (up 21%) across the series while Celebrity Juice averaged 2.2 million viewers (up 12%), with one episode peaking at 3.1 million (14% share) making it the most-watched non-terrestrial programme of the year. We are continuing to invest in brand-defining content for our digital channels with new drama commissions for ITV2 and rights to the French Open, Europa League and the African Cup of Nations for ITV4., 80043=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Form of Proxy for 2012 Annual General Meeting, 21063=Mobile viewing has increased rapidly in 2011, representing 9% of all VOD viewing of ITV content in December, comparable with the BBC iPlayer. This enables us to engage ever more closely with consumers. In the first seven months following its launch the ITV Player app had more than three million downloads., 68622=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We remain cautious on the television advertising outlook for 2012, but we expect to outperform the market for the full year. Our progress against the Plan and the strength of our results gives the Board confidence to propose a full year dividend of 1.6p., 2683=We will maintain our tight focus on cash management throughout the organisation. With positive net cash of \u00a345 million, ITV is in a strong position financially which gives us the flexibility to invest in the business while making the right decisions for the long-term future of the business. After \u00a3339 million of bond buy-backs in 2011 we will continue to look at options for the balance sheet that make economic sense. We are conscious of the uncertain economic environment and the need to maintain flexibility to deliver our strategic priorities., 12603=We continue to look at new ways of working with creative talent and have signed a development agreement with an independent production company, The Garden. We have also entered into a joint venture with BAFTA-winning Channel 4 drama commissioners Camilla Campbell and Robert Wulff-Cochrane to establish a new scripted production company, Noho Film and TV, which will begin development on a number of projects in 2012., 32712=In 2011, ITV Family's share of viewing (SOV) was up 1%, driven by the continued strong growth of our digital channels which were up 10%. ITV1 SOV, which benefited from the successful launch of ITV1+1, was down 2% - this is below where we want it to be and we will work to improve performance in 2012., 9139=2012 and beyond, 5907=We will increasingly focus on long-running, returnable series and have a strong schedule for 2012 with returning dramas such as Downton Abbey, Vera, and Scott and Bailey alongside an exciting line-up of new drama including SWAGS, Titanic and Mrs Biggs - many of which are being made by ITVS. A number of ITV's top entertainment shows will be returning in 2012, including X Factor, I'm a Celebrity, Dancing on Ice and Long Lost Family, while we will be screening new shows including Superstar and Fool Britannia., 38410=In 2011 we launched our investment programme in technology in order to make the business fit-for-purpose. We have begun to roll out our desktop refresh, which is aimed at giving all of our people the best tools for the job, and we will continue this refresh throughout 2012. We are now taking steps towards complete digital production for all of our shows by implementing plans for tapeless content. Significant technology projects are being implemented across the organisation - we are aware that they will take time to accomplish but we are confident that they will lead to great improvements to the way in which we operate., 4824=We will continue to build scale in our online business, improving the distribution and performance of ITV Player, and driving up online viewing and revenues. We also plan to make ITV Player available on manufacturers' connected television sets and launch YouView. We will expand our pay strategy in 2012, as we launch ITV Pay Player and pay products, renegotiate existing video on demand deals and negotiate new ones, and develop potential pay channels over time. We also plan to roll out our 'Total Value' exploitation under new teams., 76472=In August 2010 we announced our strategy to transform the business over five years, focusing on our four strategic priorities:, 31855=ITV1's on-screen successes in 2011 have included Vera, Marchlands, Scott and Bailey, Strangeways, the Rugby World Cup, Doc Martin, and Downton Abbey, which won a Golden Globe for best mini-series, as well as winning the Christmas ratings battle with a consolidated audience of 12 million. Four of the top five performing new dramas were on ITV1 in 2011 and ITV1 also won the Terrestrial Channel of the Year Award at the Edinburgh Television Festival., 30890=Some of our key shows, including X Factor and I'm a Celebrity, did not perform as well as in 2010, but they remain very important brands for us as they still drive large, diverse audiences, which appeal greatly to advertisers. We remain committed to these programmes and continually look at ways of refreshing them to improve their on-screen performance. ITV1 continues to deliver some of the largest audiences on television. The average X Factor audience across the series was 12.3 million, which made it the largest entertainment format on UK television in 2011, as it has been for three of the last four years. It was also the third most successful series ever of the show in terms of audience., 300998=For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is Trustnet Limited of 2nd Floor, Golden House, 30 Great Pulteney Street, London, W1F 9NN. Our nominated representative for the purpose of this Act is Kirsty Witter., 39416=We have continued to restructure ITV where appropriate to drive out waste and complexity in the business. During 2011 we delivered cost savings of \u00a320 million, ahead of the targeted \u00a315 million. These savings follow on from the \u00a340 million delivered in 2010. We will remain focused on costs to ensure that we have the appropriate cost base across the business and have identified a further \u00a320 million of savings in 2012. Our continued commitment to the tight management of cash and costs has helped us move into a positive net cash position of \u00a345 million at the end of 2011. We have also improved the efficiency of our balance sheet with \u00a3339 million of bond buy-backs. We continued our long-term strategy of managing the costs and risks associated with the pension schemes through our longevity swap and an extension to the SDN pension partnership., 26060=A. We will spend around \u00a31 billion on programming in 2012 which will give the schedule the variety and quality we need for our viewers and advertisers. We will also continue to invest in brand defining content for our digital channels., 31287=Our soaps continued to perform strongly with Emmerdale (average 7.6 million viewers per episode) increasing SOV by 3% during the year, while Coronation Street (9.4 million viewers) was only marginally down (-1%) despite the tough comparative of the 50th anniversary year in 2010., 34307=A. We are targeting a further \u00a320 million of cost savings in 2012, we will be continuing to roll out our desktop refresh programme to all areas of the business and we will see the first people moving into our new offices in MediaCity. We will also continue to focus on getting the right people to work for ITV., 78088=Caroline Cook\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0207 157 3709 or 07799 071509, 36501=During 2011, we made progress in simplifying the network structure through the acquisition of Channel Television., 81507=Appendix A to this announcement contains the Report and Accounts 2011 in unedited full text for the purposes of compliance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. Any page and note references refer to page numbers and notes in the Report and Accounts 2011., 13764=We have highlighted the need to have a significant stake in the intellectual property rights of the content we show on our screens, and have made progress in this area in 2011. ITVS produced 1,929 hours of original commissions (2010: 1,740) for the ITV1 network, increasing its share of the network's spend to 55% from 53% in 2010 but we want to grow our share further still., 7723=In 2012 we will continue to build strength in the team across ITV to drive forward the Transformation Plan. We will look for further ways to improve efficiency and performance, driving out waste and complexity. We have identified a further \u00a320 million of cost savings and planned further improvements in technology - our desktop refresh will continue throughout the year to ensure that our people have the right equipment to do their jobs. Capital expenditure in 2012 is expected to be \u00a370-\u00a380 million as we make these technological improvements and implement our site move from Manchester. We will also continue to build the improved collaborative creative process between Broadcast and Studios to help focus on creating long-running, returnable formats., 19629=In 2011 we announced the first product placement deals in the UK with Nationwide and Nestl\u00e9 but the market remains very small. We previously highlighted that the new rules which Ofcom implemented would impact our ability to exploit this new revenue stream and this continues to be the case., 74373=2012 and beyond, 5277=Live top sporting events in 2012 include Euro 2012, Champions League, Europa League, Tour de France and The French Open tennis. We will also continue to implement our ongoing news review.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{790070=At 31 December 2010, 261671=During the year the Committee considered the performance and audit fees of the external auditor, and the level of non-audit work undertaken, and recommended to the Board that a resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc for a further year as the Company's auditor be proposed to shareholders at the AGM in May 2011. The resolution was passed and KPMG Audit Plc was reappointed for a further year., 106826=Our credit ratings continued to improve in 2011. In April, Standard & Poor's upgraded the long-term credit rating from B+ (Stable Outlook) to BB (Stable Outlook) and Moody's Investors Service increased its rating from Ba3 (Stable Outlook) to Ba2 (Stable Outlook). In May, Fitch revised its outlook on our BB rating from Stable to Positive. In August, Moody's Investors Service similarly revised upward the outlook., 293161=2012, 233495=The Company considers annually whether it is appropriate to commission an investor audit. No audit was undertaken in 2011., 162126=It is the Company's policy not to make cash contributions to any political party. However, within the normal activities of the Group's national and regional news-gathering operations there may be occasions when an activity may fall within the broader definition of 'political expenditure' contained within the Companies Act 2006. Shareholder authority for such expenditure was given at the 2011 Annual General Meeting. However, during 2011 the Group made no payments falling within this definition (2010: nil)., 181736=\u2022\u00a0 CEO, GE Capital Global Consumer Finance UK (1996-1998), 101835=Nov 2016, 184466=\u2022\u00a0 Director of Deregulation Unit, BIS (formerly the DTI) and Cabinet Office\u00a0 (1995-1997), 221899=The Company's aim is to reflect UK demographics both representationally within the organisation and on-screen. Year-on-year progress has been achieved in working towards this target. Key activity in 2011 included:, 181129=\u2022 Group Chief Executive of RSA Insurance Group plc (2003-2011), 305004=2012 Bonus performance targets, 320966=EPS base year 2008, 20066=In 2011, we gained market share once again, increasing our SOB to 45.3% of the total UK television market.

This is achieved through our inclusive Equal Opportunities policy. Our policy reflects the Equality Act 2010 and aims for equality around gender, marital or parental status, race, origin, nationality, religious belief, disability, age, sexual orientation, and gender reassignment. ITV is recognised as a positive employer, holding the 'two-tick' disability symbol and being the only broadcaster to be part of Stonewall's top 100 Workplace Equality Index, for the second year running. ITV participates in major national and industry-specific diversity forums, working as a collective to share best practice and campaign for change., 105952=We are aware of the inefficiency of the balance sheet and, as noted above, have continued to take steps during the course of the year to help address this. Since October 2009 we have repurchased \u00a3662 million (nominal value) of debt., 306373=As part of the incentives framework introduced in 2011 to support the delivery of the Transformation Plan, changes were made to the terms of the long-term incentive awards to be made to the Senior Executive Group under the PSP. The same arrangements will be used in 2012., 370841=8 March 2011 Core Award, 195865=Some of the things the Board has focused on during 2011 include:, 209517=3 September 2010, 372466=8 March 2011 Matching Award, 656311=The total operating lease expenditure recognised during the year was \u00a342 million (2010 restated: \u00a312 million) and total sublease payments received was \u00a34 million (2010 restated: \u00a35 million)., 181451=\u2022\u00a0 Director of AXA UK plc (life and pensions) (1999-2003), 710008=A deferred tax asset of \u00a3558 million (2010: \u00a3602 million) in respect of capital losses of \u00a32,230 million (2010: \u00a32,230 million) has not been recognised due to uncertainties as to the amount and whether a capital gain will arise in the appropriate form and relevant territory against which such losses could be utilised. For the same reasons, deferred tax assets in respect of overseas losses of \u00a39 million (2010: \u00a39 million) that time expire between 2017 and 2026 have not been recognised., 113105=Given that the timetable for the valuation of Section A of the Scheme was different to that of Sections B and C, in order to increase efficiency and to streamline the processes the Group has agreed with the Trustee that actuarial valuations of all three sections will be undertaken as at 1 January 2011. We are in ongoing discussions with the Trustee regarding the results., 143470=As in the previous year, the pay award for 2011 for eligible employees (earning above \u00a360,000) was performance-related. We share the success of ITV through our all-employee annual bonus which paid out in 2011. The Company also operates an all-employee Save As You Earn scheme., 184764=\u2022\u00a0 Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and Food (1973-1992), 672566=The \u00a33 million gain principally relates to the sale of Screenvision Holdings (Europe) Limited. In 2010 the \u00a34 million gain principally related to the sale of Screenvision US (Technicolor Cinema Advertising LLC)., 96334=The 'profit to cash' ratio is more in line with target this year following the very high conversion rates over the previous two years. Programme rights and other inventory have reduced by over \u00a3200 million since 2008, meaning that they are now at more normal levels., 301516=2011 Bonus performance measures, 187143=\u2022\u00a0 Non-executive director of Negative Equity \u00a0Protection Holdings Limited (2007-2009), Millen Group Limited (2007-2009) and\u00a0 BMS Associates Limited (2004-2008), 234243=The AGM for 2012 will be held on 9 May 2012 (further details can be found in Other Governance and Statutory Disclosures ). The Notice of Meeting sets out the resolutions being proposed. The Notice, together with any related documents, is made available to shareholders at www.itvplc.com, or is mailed to them, if they have elected to receive hard copies, at least 20 working days before the meeting. Last year all resolutions were passed with votes ranging from 86.94% to 99.92%., 811795=Method 1: All business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2009 were accounted for using the acquisition method. Under this method, goodwill is measured as the fair value of the consideration paid (including the recognition of any non-controlling interests of the business being bought), less the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured at the acquisition date. Subsequent adjustments to the fair value of net assets acquired can only be made within 12 months of the acquisition date, and only if fair values were determined provisionally at an earlier reporting date. These adjustments are accounted for from the date of acquisition. Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. Transaction costs incurred in connection with those business combinations, such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees were expensed as incurred., 70733=2011, 810669=There are \u00a310 million of capital commitments at 31 December 2011 (2010: \u00a32 million)., 290975=1 January 2011, 219187=All Directors are required by the Company's Articles of Association to be elected by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting (AGM) following their appointment by the Board. Subsequently, all Directors are subject to re-election by shareholders at least every three years. However, all Directors will be submitted for re-election at the AGM in 2012 as recommended by the Code., 142334=We have continued to invest in our people through training programmes for all employees as well as leadership development. 92% of managers benefited from formal training in 2011. The introduction of a new online performance management tool will continue to ensure clarity around capability and objective-setting as well as succession planning. More detailed information around leadership and succession planning can be found in the Governance section., 179157=\u2022\u00a0 Member of the National Employment Panel (2006-2008), 41082=In 2011 we have taken further cost out of the business. \u00a320 million of cost savings have been delivered, which is ahead of our \u00a315 million target, and we have kept a tight grip on the schedule costs (the costs of programmes shown on air)., 69578=The adjusted financing costs in 2012 are likely to be broadly flat as the full year benefit from the bond buy-backs carried out in 2011 is likely to be largely offset by a step up in the interest rate on the 2019 loan., 280959=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reviewed annually from 1 January., 309657=The PSP was the only LTIP used to make awards in 2009, 2010 and 2011., 172113=\u2022 Member of Parliament (1997-2005), Chief Executive and Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party (1998-1999); Shadow Minister for Europe (1999-2000); Shadow Secretary of State for Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (2000-2001); Founder, Policy Exchange (2001), 744695=At 1 January, 111372=On 8 July 2011, the partnership's interest in SDN was increased by a further \u00a350 million, enabled by the increase in the value of the SDN business. As a result of this, the partnership will increase the annual contribution to the Scheme by \u00a33 million to \u00a311 million per annum from 2013 onwards; the 2012 cash contribution will be \u00a310 million. Under the partnership arrangements, we have committed to making a payment to the main section of the Scheme of up to \u00a3200 million in 2022 (an increase of \u00a350 million compared to the original agreement made in 2010), if and to the extent that it remains in deficit., 186297=\u00a0(2010, director from 2009), 385781=March 2014-, 418770=The Annual General Meeting will be held on Wednesday, 9 May 2012 at 11.00 am at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, London, SW1P 3EE. The Notice of the Annual General Meeting contains an explanation of special business to be considered at the meeting. A copy of the Notice will be available on the Company's website at www.itvplc.com., 97377=A \u00a3233 million improvement in the year has resulted in a positive net cash position at 31 December 2011 of \u00a345 million (31 December 2010: net debt of \u00a3188 million). Total cash has reduced by \u00a359 million in the year to \u00a3801 million, as a significant portion of the cash generated from operations has been used to reduce gross debt. This reduction in gross debt has been achieved through \u00a3339 million (nominal) of debt buy-backs., 68053=Adjusted financing costs are \u00a319 million (28%) lower as we continue to make the balance sheet more efficient. Financing costs directly attributable to bonds have reduced due to the benefit of \u00a3485 million of bond buy-backs over the last two years, including \u00a3339 million in 2011. Cash-related net financing income has increased by \u00a37 million, mainly due to the increased level of cash held and the benefit of receiving a better return through a slightly longer investment horizon., 387682=2 October 2008, 244664=In 2011 the Committee met eight times., 416851=All advisers and suppliers are appointed through a rigorous tender process and are monitored through regular informal review meetings. There is a timetable for completing a formal review of advisers. No formal reviews were undertaken in 2011., 192902=The number of meetings held during the year and attendance of Directors is set out in the table below. An annual schedule of matters the Board wishes to consider at each meeting and at each meeting of its committees is produced. Meetings are normally held at one of the London sites and at least once a year at one of the regional offices. In 2011 the Board met colleagues in Leeds. Board meetings are structured around the following areas:, 172573=\u2022 Finance Director, Kingfisher plc (1986-1991), 721397=Earnings per share 2010, 117370=Total expected pension contributions in 2012, 384353=8 March 2011 Matching, 176936=\u00a0Business Communications (1995-2000), 51279=Other commercial income includes sponsorship, minority revenues, pay, PRS, media sales and other income. The 6% growth in 2011 has been helped by the new pay revenues from ITV2, 3 and 4 HD on Sky. These pay revenues will increase again in 2012 due to the new deals signed with Sky, Lovefilm and Netflix., 164923=2008, 98369=The \u00a316 million of dividend payments represents only the payment of the interim dividend whereas in 2012 we are likely to pay both the 2011 final and the 2012 interim dividends., 560674=Balance at 31 December 2010, 238698=Finally, we note that whilst we are satisfied with the work of our auditors KPMG and recommend their reappointment at the forthcoming AGM, in 2012 we plan to carry out a more thorough review and market appraisal to be considered in formulating the Committee's recommendation for the appointment of auditors at the 2013 AGM., 356129=of 2011, 174731=\u2022\u00a0 Joined Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in 1988,, 430398=Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006, 265098=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Committee believes that the level of bonus payments for 2011 is a fair reflection of the Company performance during the year. It reflects the progress made against the Transformation Plan, reducing ITV's cost base and managing cash and working capital in 2011;, 62386=The creative renewal process within ITV Studios is beginning to show signs of momentum, as evidenced by the increase in\u00a0 new commissions, which are up 28% in 2011. However, the lead time between commission, delivery and transmission means it takes time for this momentum to come through into the financial numbers., 302536=ITV's financial performance in 2011 has been strong, as outlined in the Performance & Financials section. In light of performance during the year, the following payment levels against corporate financial targets for the executive Directors have been approved:, 708977=Due to the change in the statutory tax rate, deferred tax is provided at 25% (2010: 27%), which is the rate that has been substantively enacted to apply from 1 April 2012. The impact of the change in the tax rate is \u00a36 million (2010: nil), of which \u00a33 million was recognised in the deferred tax charge and the remainder recognised in equity., 447377=\u00a0 2011 \u00a3m, 188165=\u2022\u00a0 Held various positions within Arthur Andersen from 1970, 315798=2010 levels, 322131=2009 levels, 367006=March 2014, 245237=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial reporting: the Committee reviewed the financial information published by the Company, including the annual financial statements and half year financial report. To assist its review the Committee received reports from management and from the auditors on compliance with accounting standards, key judgements in preparation of the financial statements and compliance of those statements with best practice and laid down disclosure standards. The Committee was pleased at the progress made in clarifying what are often complex explanations and disclosures in the new format 2010 financial statements. The Committee introduced a new process for verifying Interim Management Statements., 344483=31 December, 687825=Tax losses brought forward may be utilised against current year profits if the brought forward losses and the current year profits are of the same type. Use of tax losses in this way leads to a reduction of the tax charge. Tax losses of \u00a311 million (2010: \u00a368 million) principally include the recognition of a deferred tax asset of \u00a311 million (2010: \u00a345 million) on the remaining financing losses linked to previous investments ('loan relationship deficits') following the successful conclusion of an enquiry with the tax authorities. In 2010 this also included a credit for utilisation of \u00a316 million of previously deferred loan relationship deficits and a credit of \u00a35 million on the recognition of a deferred tax asset on other losses., 170473=1 January 2010, 411619=Trusts: The Company has a discretionary trust funded by loans to acquire shares for the potential benefit of employees of the Group. Details of shares held by the trust at 31 December 2011 are set out in Section 4 Capital Structure and Financing Costs. During the year shares have been released from the trust in respect of share schemes for employees. The trust waives the right to dividends payable on those shares held by the trust that are not subject to any share plan operated by the Company where participants are the beneficial but not registered owners of shares., 377472=8 March 2014, 179704=Chairman of the West London Consortium (2006-2011), 211609=18 January 2008, 672079=In 2011 a \u00a33 million (2010: \u00a34 million) loss on sale and impairment of non-current assets was incurred primarily as a result of a detailed fixed asset review undertaken in preparation for moving premises in Manchester., 159929=During 2011, our activities have ranged from charitable giving to donations to specific programmes and campaigns. In all, ITV has contributed to \u00a31.5 million in cash (2010: \u00a31.5 million) and \u00a33.4 million in-kind (2010: \u00a35.7 million). In addition through our call to action campaigns, such as Born to Shine, Malaria No More and Text Santa we have raised \u00a36.4 million through text and phone lines. Text Santa was a major new charity initiative, launched as a dedicated on-air appeal over the Christmas period, raising awareness and money for those most vulnerable during the festive period. In all, we raised a total of \u00a34.1 million, which will be split between our nine deserving charities:\u00a0Carers UK, Crisis, Help the Hospices, Samaritans and WRVS, as well as children's hospital charities Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, Noah's Ark Appeal, Helping Hand, and Yorkhill Children's Foundation. We hope to repeat this in 2012., 655343=Property leases typically run for a period of between 3 and 15 years and may have an option to renew after that date. Lease payments are generally subject to market review every 5 years to reflect market rentals, but because of the uncertainty over the amount of any future changes, such changes have not been reflected in the table above. None of the leases include contingent rentals. The property operating lease disclosures in 2010 have been restated principally because of revised estimations of break clauses in the lease contracts., 300911=2011 Bonus outcomes, 140612=The following information summarises the impact that the Company's operations have had on its people, customers, suppliers, community and environment during 2011., 218281=In view of the relatively new makeup of the Board, for 2011 the evaluation took the form of interviews by the Chairman with each Board member which resulted in some adjustments to the Board agendas and appropriate changes in Board focus and conduct., 102736=March 2019, 115793=10% of 2011 EBITA before exceptional items over \u00a3300 million, 187849=\u2022\u00a0 Practice senior partner, London, Deloitte & Touche (2002-2004), 399011=\u00a0Any portion of the award that does not vest following the publication of the results for the year ended 31 December 2011, or that is not exercised by 31 December 2012, will lapse and the Plan will terminate., 104399=During the year we took further steps to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet, where it made economic sense to do so. In 2011 we repurchased \u00a3339 million nominal value of bonds comprising all of the \u00a3110 million 2013 bonds (at a book loss of \u00a34 million) and \u00a3229 million of the 2015 bonds. The repurchase of 2015 bonds was at a book loss of \u00a335 million, which was mainly incurred against repurchasing all \u00a3100 million of a tap issue to this series of bonds undertaken in early 2009 at the height of the financial crisis., 661652=Fees payable to KPMG and associates for the auditing of accounts of any associate of the Group, internal audit services, services relating to corporate finance transactions entered into or proposed to be entered into, by or on behalf of the Group or any of its associates, and any other assurance services were \u00a3nil during 2011 and 2010., 197511=Some of the things the Board is planning for 2012 include:, 236334=On the following pages we set out the Audit Committee's Report for 2011. The report comprises four sections:, 261089=The Committee has noted that KPMG have been the Company's auditors since 2004 and while satisfied with their work considers it best practice periodically to undertake a more thorough review and market appraisal.\u00a0 The Committee plans to carry out such a review in 2012 to be taken into account in formulating the recommendation to the Board for the reappointment of auditors at the 2013 AGM., 191168=29 February 2012, 106309=In 2012 we will continue to look at the options for the balance sheet that make economic sense. Any potential course of action will take into account our prudent view of liquidity under an uncertain economic outlook, and ensure that sufficient flexibility is maintained to invest in the business and to deliver the Transformation Plan., 715343=Adjusted earnings per share 2011, 79019=The final dividend will be payable on 1 June 2012 to shareholders on the register as at 4 May 2012. The ex-dividend date will be 2 May 2012., 370401=\u00a0April 2013-, 244582=What we focused on in 2011, 59633=UK production revenues have increased by \u00a327 million, largely as a result of an increase in supply to ITV channels, where there has been an increase in the ITV Studios proportion of ITV1 original commissions from 53% in 2010 to 55% in 2011., 300987=Performance targets for the Senior Executive Group in 2011 were set to ensure they support both the Transformation Plan and delivery of key operational outcomes. The Committee ensured that the maximum bonus opportunity could only be achieved for significant outperformance of all corporate, financial and individual bonus outcomes, with on target performance achieving a 60% payout of maximum bonus opportunity., 372290=March 2015, 97959=Interest paid was lower than 2010 as our adjusted financing costs reduced, but we also had one-off losses on debt buy-backs of \u00a339 million and higher corporation tax payable as we returned to a full year of making payments for taxable profits. We also resumed the payment of dividends., 172773=\u2022 Non-executive director of British Rail (1992-1994), Railtrack plc (1994-2000), and Geest plc (1988-1991), 135034=In 2010 we identified two potential strategic risks - 1) inadequate management information and 2) inadequate infrastructure - which are not included in our 2011/12 risk register. Following improvements in our management information systems we no longer deem this to be a key strategic risk, and the risk of inadequate infrastructure has been encompassed within more specific risks above., 118010=Assuming no unforeseen circumstances, no further change is currently expected in our committed contributions to Section A of the Scheme before 2015., 113921=We expect to make deficit funding contributions of \u00a371 million in 2012, \u00a366 million to Section A and \u00a35 million to Sections B and C. Details of how this is constituted can be seen in section 3.6 of the Financial Statements and are summarised below., 184621=\u2022\u00a0 Member of Prime Minister's Policy Unit (1992-1994), 151541=In 2011 we continued to commission an independent research company to recruit and survey a Vision Panel. The panel is representative of 8,000 adult television viewers. This enables ITV to measure audience reaction to programmes and content on a daily basis and to achieve an in-depth understanding of viewer expectations and preferences. The panel enables ITV to ask further questions about its channels, new ideas and views on broader media issues. Qualitative research is also obtained via focus groups which may target particular demographics to gain insights for programme development., 404279=The market price of the ITV plc ordinary shares at 31 December 2011 was 68.15 pence and the range during the year was 51.65 pence (on 12 September 2011) to 93.45 pence (on 2 March 2011)., 210562=1 January 2010, 108166=The aggregate IAS 19 deficit on defined benefit schemes at 31 December 2011 was \u00a3390 million (31 December 2010: \u00a3313 million). The most significant reason for the increase was as a result of the fall in corporate bond yields which are used to value the liabilities, although this was partially offset by a reduction in the rate of market implied inflation. The value of the assets of the ITV Pension Scheme ('the Scheme') increased during the year, driven by a strong performance by the bonds and swaps used for hedging interest and inflation risk. This gain has been reduced by losses in the Scheme's equity portfolio and the impact of the introduction of the longevity swap.\u00a0, 602720=As required by EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002) the Group's accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU ('IFRS'), and approved by the Directors., 79966=Whilst statutory profit before tax of \u00a3327 million (2010: \u00a3286 million) has improved, basic earnings per share are lower than 2010 due to the statutory tax charge. The reason for this statutory tax charge increase of \u00a363 million is primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset of \u00a368 million in 2010 in respect of tax losses not previously recognised., 109626=On 22 August 2011 the trustee of the Scheme ('the Trustee') completed a transaction that removes the risk of increases in pension liabilities that would arise if a significant portion of the Scheme's defined benefit pensioner population were to enjoy a longer life than is currently expected. The instrument is known as a longevity swap and it de-risks the future cash flows of the pension scheme., 423029=The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities., 33439=2010, 645387=There are no Staff costs within exceptional items in 2011 (2010: \u00a311 million)., 114475=Expected Pension Contributions in 2012, 181883=\u2022\u00a0 President of National Westminster Bank US Consumer Credit Business (1995-1996), senior vice-president and head of US Consumer Loan Products Division (1992-1995), 812999=Method 2: All business combinations that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008 were accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with IFRS 3 'Business Combinations (2004)'. Goodwill on those combinations represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and did not include the value of the non-controlling interest. Transaction costs incurred in connection with those business combinations, such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees were included in the cost of acquisition., 181340=\u2022\u00a0 Chief Executive of AXA Sun Life plc (1999-2003), 710977=Earnings per share 2011, 199995=At the AGM in May 2012 there will be resolutions to re-elect each of the Directors., 101383=Oct 2015, 182518=3 September 2010, 172675=\u2022 Chairman, Chartwell Land plc (1987-1991), 174612=\u2022\u00a0 Chief Executive of the Football Association (2000-2002), 187373=\u2022\u00a0 Member of audit and retail risk control committees and HBOS plc (2004-2008), 624838=The Board of Directors considers the business primarily from a product or activity perspective. The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 are therefore 'Broadcasting & Online' and 'ITV Studios', the results of which are outlined in the following table:, 344873=31 December, 99476=Strong free cash flow generation in 2011 further strengthened the balance sheet and liquidity position., 177062=\u2022\u00a0 Manager in audit and corporate finance Ernst & Young (1988-1994), 136336=During 2011, our responsibility strategy has been revised to align to the Transformation Plan and our four strategic priorities, and to contribute towards long-term industry sustainability. The strategy also aims to mitigate our risks and uncertainties and ensure the Company continues to behave in a responsible manner through specific performance targets. Objectives have been identified by the newly formed Corporate Responsibility Committee and are supported by the Management Board. A new role of Head of Corporate Responsibility has been appointed to roll out the strategy across the Company.
