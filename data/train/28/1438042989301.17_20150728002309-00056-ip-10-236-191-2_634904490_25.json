            "Description",
            "Production Narrative: Data collected were processed to determine that valid GPS values were achieved on all flights. The flight data was processed using proprietary automated algorithms that calculate the x, y, and z value of each point by combining GPS position of the aircraft, IMU attitude of the aircraft, range of the laser pulse, and scan angle of the laser scanner. Resulting data from each flight line was then compared to crossing and bordering flight lines to identify any residual pitch, roll or yaw errors. Data were also compared to calibration flights over airports in or adjacent to the Cape Fear and Lumber River Basins. Data were then edited in TerraModel by comparing contour lines, shaded relief models (hillshading) and points clouds within tiles and from one tile to the next. Finally, the data were compared to available ground survey data prior to submitting to the State for QAQC checks.",
            "Lidar points were supplied to the USGS EROS Center. Points received in a file format other than LAS were converted to LAS, if the data contained adequate attribute information to create a valid LAS file and without the loss of any original attribute information. The points have been re-tiled into a standard Quarter-Quad, or Quarter-Quarter-Quad, scheme for publication on the CLICK website. The data remain in the Coordinate Reference System in which they were received. No alteration of any sort, of either the geometry or attribute values or structure has been performed.",
            "The lidar point data were received by the NOAA Coastal Services Center from the USGS Center for Lidar Coordination and Knowledge (CLICK) in las format. The files contained lidar elevation and intensity measurements. The data were unclassified, in State Plane coordinates, and were vertically referenced to NAVD88. CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The data were converted from State Plane coordinates to geographic coordinates. 2. The data were converted from orthometric (NAVD88) heights to ellipsoidal heights using Geoid99. 3. The data were sorted by time. 4. The data were converted to LAZ format.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
