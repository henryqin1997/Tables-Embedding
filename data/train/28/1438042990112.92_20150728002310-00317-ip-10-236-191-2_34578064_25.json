Food for thought Also: Trapinch -> Vibrava -> Salamence Bagon -> Shelgon -> Flygon From DPBP I don't wanna lose this bit on information so I'll put it here. Regarding DPBP... Aipom and Ambipom, expected to be numbers 218 and 219, respectively, were moved to #267 and #268. It is unknown why their original position after the Hoppip family was changed. The next family, Sunkern's, occupies numbers 219 and 220. As Aipom received a new evolution and would have required a second slot, MK's hypothesis is that they forgot about Ambipom when numbering the Pok\u00e9mon. The following Pok\u00e9mon, all of which notably do not evolve, were moved: Qwilfish, expected to be #267, was moved to #218. Girafarig, expected to be #259 after Wobbuffet, was moved all the way to #489, after Gastrodon; this is where Ambipom's space would have been had he been unrelated to Aipom. Shuckle, expected to be #268 (#267 accommodating Qwilfish's move), was moved to Girafarig's place. Lol I was looking through a text file I had and found this text.
