    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Dedicated, beach-bums, hardworking, sun-bathers, and Mormon. Great if you're an international student because this school has one of the highest international student populations, with students from over 70 different countries! Tips for prospective students This is an LDS-run school (Mormon). Therefore, before every class we pray and every student is required to take religion courses. However, being that this is a church school, there is no theft, immodesty, or cheating so its a very good school if you have high morals. Make sure to have a lot of extracurricular activities and a great reccomendation. Bang for the buck Very cheap considering it's a private school. Great staff, good courses, amazing location! Air fare isn't all that cheap though.. Am enjoying being here Its in HAWAII!! Whats not to like about it? The school is a 5 min walk to the beach and a grocery store for all my college needs. However, I do miss being in a city with excitment and things to do. If you don't enjoy hiking, surfing, or lounging at the beach you could get a bit bored after about a mnoth or so. Am learning a lot",
