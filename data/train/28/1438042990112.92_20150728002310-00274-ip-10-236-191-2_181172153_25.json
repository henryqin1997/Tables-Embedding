    "textBeforeTable": "A click on the icon for the Tip Report for the man with genetic distance of 2 (and the same surname) showed the comparison chart: There were several matches ranging from genetic distances of 1 to 7. But the two that jumped off the page were two McGinnis males. One was a genetic distance of 2, the other was 3. You might be wondering what that means. I was pretty excited and went to see who we matched and whether or not the surname was the same as ours (McGinnis). Readers might recall that I recently upgraded my brother's Y-DNA test to 67 markers.\u00a0 Y-DNA67 match was found between my brother's DNA test and another person in the Family Tree DNA database. Family Tree DNA stating that a Yesterday I received an email from Update on 67 Marker Y-DNA Test June 8, 2011 Labels: Childrens Games, Genealogy for Children,",
    "textAfterTable": "Wow that means there is a 96% chance that within 12 generations we share a common ancestor. I'm even happy with that 8 generation showing of 83% because I can trace my McGinnis ancestry back 6 generations counting me. So there's a chance if my match knows his ancestry back further, we can link up or at least narrow locations for residency and origins.\u00a0 I checked the McGinnis male who was a genetic distance of 3 from my brother. The comparison chart showed Generations \u00a0Percentage 4 24.70% 8 70.14% 12 91.91% 16 98.24% Those are pretty good numbers too. My next step was to write to both these men. I was pretty excited but the first one bounced back with a rejected email address. That's really aggravating and disappointing when people take the DNA tests, sign up to share their information and then don't keep their emails updated. So I have no way of contacting the man who was a genetic distance of 3 from my brother with the 67 marker DNA test I'm waiting eagerly to hear from",
