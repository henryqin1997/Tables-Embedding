Biol. 222: 581-597), 25 pmol VL1, 250 \u03bcM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 pl (5 units) Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) in the manufacturers buffer. The reaction mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of amplification (94\ufffd C. for 30 s, 50\ufffd C. for 30 s and 72\ufffd C. for 1 min) using a Hybaid OmniGene cycler., 150411=DNA encoding the fusion proteins (e.g. C6.5Ab-PE) of this invention may be prepared by any suitable method, including, for example, cloning and restriction of appropriate sequences or direct chemical synthesis by methods such as the phosphotriester method of Narang et at. Meth. Enzymol. 68: 90-99 (1979); the phosphodiester method of Brown et al., Meth. Enzymol. 68: 109-151 (1979); the diethylphosphoramidite method of Beaucage et al., Tetra. Lett., 22: 1859-1862 (1981); and the solid support method of U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,066., 242048=The Kd of light chain shuffled C6.5 mutants isolated from phage selection using Immunotubes (Nunc) were determined by Scatchard analysis. All assays were performed in triplicate. Briefly, 50 mg of radioiodinated sFv was added to 5\ufffd106 SK-OV cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled sFv from the same preparation. After a 30 minute incubation at 20\ufffd C., the samples were washed with PBS at 4\ufffd C. and centrifuged at 500 g. The amount of labeled sFv bound to the cells was determined by counting the pellets in a gamma counter and the Ka, and Kd were calculated using the EBDA program (V 2.0, G. A. McPherson, 1983). The Kd of all the other isolated sFv were determined using surface plasmon resonance in a BIAcore (Pharmacia). In a BIAcore flow cell, approximately 1400 resonance units (RU) of c-erbB-2 ECD (25 \u03bcg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5) was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (Johnsson et al. (1991), supra). Association and dissociation-rates were measured under continuous flow of 5 ml/min using a concentration range from 50 to 800 nM. Rate constant kon was determined from a plot of (1(dR/dt))/t vs concentration (Karlsson et al. (1991), supra). Rate constant Hoff was determined from the dissociation part of the sensorgram at the highest concentration of sFv analyzed. Cell surface retention of C6.5 and C6L1 was determined as described in Example 1., 187957=After each round of selection, 10 ml of E.coli HB2151 (Carter et al. (1985) Nucleic Adds Res., 13: 4431-43) (A600 run\u02dc0.8) were infected with 100 \u03bcl of the phage eluate in order to prepare soluble sFv. In this strain, the amber codon between the sFv gene and gene III is read as a stop codon and native soluble sFv secreted into the periplasm and media (Hoogenboom et al. (1991) Nucleic Acids Res. 19: 4133-4137). Single ampicillin resistant colonies were used to inoculate microtitre plate wells containing 150 \u03bcl of 2\ufffdTY containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 0.1% glucose. The bacteria were grown to an A600 nm\u02dc1.0, and sFv expression induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM (De Bellis et al., (1990) Nucleic Acids Res., 18:1311). Bacteria were grown overnight at 30\ufffd C., the cells removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing sFv used directly., 56813=Using the sequence information provided, the nucleic acids may be synthesized according to a number of standard methods known to those of skill in the art. Oligonucleotide synthesis, is preferably carried out on commercially available solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis machines (Needham-VanDevanter et al. (1984) Nucleic Acids Res. 12:6159-6168) or manually synthesized using the solid phase phosphoramidite triester method described by Beaucage et. al. (Beaucage et. al. (1981) Tetrahedron Letts. 22(20): 1859-1862)., 227056=The DNA fragments from the first PCR were used as templates for a second PCR to introduce a BssHII site at the 3\u2032-end of FR3 followed by a NotI site. The BssHII site corresponds to amino acid residue 93 and 94 (Kabat numbering (Kabat et al (1987) Sequences of proteins of immunological interest, 4th ed., US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Bethesda, Md.; see, Table 5 in this reference) does not change the amino acid sequence (alanine-arginine). PCR was performed as described above using 200 ng purified first PCR product as template and the back primers PVH1For2, PVH3For2, and PVH5For2. The PCR products were purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 50 \u03bcl water and 5 \u03bcg digested with NotI and NcoI. The digested fragments were gel purified and each VH gene repertoire ligated separately into pHEN-1 (Hoogenboom et al. 1991 supra.) digested with NotI and NcoI. The ligation mix was purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform, ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 20 \u03bcl water, and 2.5 \u03bcl samples electroporated (Dower et al. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16, 6127-6145) into 50 \u03bcl E. coli TG1 (Gibson et al (1984) Ph.D. Thesis, University of Cambridge). Cells were grown in 1 ml SOC (Sambrook et al. 1990) for 3 min and then plated on TYE (Miller (1972) Experiments in Molecular Genetics Cold Springs Harbor Lab Press, Cold Springs Harbor, N.Y.) media containing 100 \u03bcg ampicillin/ml and 1% (w/v) glucose (TYE-AMP-GLU). Colonies were scraped off the plates into 5 ml of 2\ufffdTY broth (Miller (1972), supra) containing 100 \u03bcg ampicillin/ml, 1% glucose (2\ufffdTY-AMP-GLU) and 15 (v/v) glycerol for storage at \u221270\ufffd C. The cloning efficiency and diversity of the libraries were determined by PCR screening (Gussow and Clackson (1989) Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 4000) as described Marks et al. (1991), supra). The resulting phage libraries were termed pHEN-1-VH1rep, pHBN-1-VHH 3rep and PHEN-1-VH5rep., 26773=This application is a divisional of and claims the benefit of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/665,202 filed Jun. 13, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,322 which is a continuation-in-part of United States Provisional Applications No. 60/000,238, filed Jun. 14, 1995, and 60/000,250, filed Jun. 15, 1995. These applications are incorporated by reference for all purposes., 307780=The Kd of sFv were determined using SPR in a BIAcore. In a BIAcore flow cell, approximately 1400 RU of c-erbB-2 ECD (90 kDa, McCartney et al. (1995) Protein Eng. 8: 301-314) were coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (Johnsson et al. (1991) supra.). Association rates were measured under continuous flow of 5 ml/min using concentrations ranging from 5.0\ufffd10\u22128 to 8.0\ufffd10\u22127 M. Rate constant kon was determined from a plot of (In (dR/dt))/t vs concentration (Karlsson et al., 1991)., 234412=All libraries were also selected using biotinylated c-erbB-2 ECD and streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads as described (Hawkin et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 226, 889-896) with some modifications. To prepare biotinylated antigen, 0.2 ml c-erbB-2 ECD (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 5 mM NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) overnight at 4\ufffd C. and then purified on a presto desalting column. For each round of selection, 1 ml of phage (approximately 1013 t.u.) were mixed with 1 ml PBS containing 4% skimmed milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20, and biotinylated c-erbB-2 ECD. Affinity-driven selections were performed by decreasing the amount of biotinylated c-erbB-2 ECD used for selection. Two selection schemes were used., 149268=Solid phase synthesis in which the C-terminal amino acid of the sequence is attached to an insoluble support followed by sequential addition of the remaining amino acids in the sequence is the preferred method for the chemical synthesis of the polypeptides of this invention. Techniques for solid phase synthesis are described by Barany and Merrifield, Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis; pp. 3-284 in The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology.

Co., Rockford, Ill. (1984)., 232614=To rescue phagemid particles from the libraries, 10 ml of 2 TY-AMP-GLU were inoculated with an appropriate volume of bacteria (approximately 50 to 100 \u03bcl) from the library stocks to give an A600 of 0.3 to 0.5 and grown for 30 min, shaking at 37\ufffd C. About 1\ufffd1012 plaque-forming units of VCS-M13 (Stratagene) particles were added and the mixture incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 30 min without shaking followed by incubation at 37\ufffd C. for 30 min with shaking. Cells were spun down, resuspended in 50 ml 2\ufffdTY broth containing 100 \u03bcg ampicillin/ml and 50 \u03bcg kanamycin/ml (2\ufffdTY-AMP-KAN), and grown overnight, shaking at 25\ufffd C. Phage particles were purified and concentrated by two PEG-precipitations (Sambrook et al., 1990), resuspended in 5 ml phosphate buffered saline (25 mM NaH2PO4, 125 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, PBS) and filtered through a 0.45 u filter. The phage preparation consistently resulted in a titre of approximately 1013 transducing units/ml ampicillin-resistant clones., 414708=The affinity of the diabody was measured using surface plasmon resonance in a BIAcore and found to be 4.2\ufffd10\u221210 M, with a koff of 3.2\ufffd1031 4 s\u22121. The retention of the FITC labeled diabody on the surface of c-erbB-2 expressing cells was determined by FACS. After 180 minutes, 77% was sill retained on the cell surface. Assuming an exponential decay for binding, this value for cell surface retention correlates with a koff of 7\ufffd10\u22125 s\u22121. This is significantly slower than the koff measured on the BIAcore, and suggests that c-erbB-2 density is higher on the cell surface than the density used for the BIAcore measurements., 161157=The immunoassays of the present invention are performed in any of several configurations, e.g., those reviewed in Maggio (ed.)

The genes encoding protein chains may be cloned in cDNA or in genomic form by any cloning procedure known to those skilled in the art. Methods of cloning genes encoding DT fused to various ligands are also well known to those of skill in the art. See, for example, Williams et al. J. Biol Chem. 265: 11885-11889 (1990) which describes the expression of growth-factor-DT fusion proteins., 146090=Many procedure and linker molecules for attachment of various compounds including radionuclide metal chelates, toxins and drugs to proteins such as antibodies are known. See, for example, European Patent Application No. 188,256; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,671,958, 4,659,839, 4,414,148, 4,699,784; 4,680,338; 4,569,789; and 4,589,071; and Borlinghaus et al. Cancer Res. 47: 4071-4075 (1987) which are incorporated herein by reference. In particular, production of various immunotoxins is well-known within the art and can be found, for example in \u201cMonoclonal Antibody-Toxin Conjugates: Aiming the Magic Bullet,\u201d Thorpe et al., Monoclonal Antibodies in Clinical Medicine, Academic Press, pp. 168-190 (1982), Waldmann, Science, 252: 1657 (1991), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,545,985 and 4,894,443., 236565=Initial analysis of chain shuffled sFv clones for binding tc-erbB-2 was performed by ELISA using bacterial supernatant containing expressed sFv. Expression of sFv (De Bellis and Schwartz (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 1311) was performed in 96 well microtitre plates as described (Marks et al. (1991), supra) with the following exception. After overnight growth and expression at 30\ufffd C., 50 \u03bcl 0.5% Tween 20 was added to each well and the plates incubated for 4 h at 37\ufffd C. with shaking to induce bacterial lysis and increase the concentration of sFv in the bacterial supernatant. For selection performed on Immunotubes, ELISA plates (Falcon 3912) were incubated with c-ebB-ECD (2.5 \u03bcg/ml) in PBS at 4\ufffd C. overnight. For selections performed with biotinylated protein, Immunolon 4 plates (Dynatech) were incubated overnight at 4\ufffd C. with Immunopure avidin (10 \u03bcg/ml in PBS; Pierce). After washing 3 times with PBS to remove unbound avidin, wells were incubated with biotinylated c-erbB-2 ECD as in Example 1. In both cases, binding of sFv to c-ebB-2 ECD was detected with the mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 (1 \u03bcg/ml), which recognizes the C-terminal peptide tag (Munro and Pelham (1986), Cell 46, 291-300) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Fc antibody (Sigma), as described (Marks et al., 1991, supra). Selected binders were further characterized by sequencing of the VH and VL genes (Sanger et al. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 74: 5463-5467). Sequence data has been deposited with the GenBank Data Library., 57368=Once a nucleic acid encoding a C6 antibody is synthesized it may be amplified and/or cloned according to standard methods. Molecular cloning techniques to achieve these ends are known in the art. A wide variety of cloning and in vitro amplification methods suitable for the construction of recombinant nucleic acids, e.g., encoding C6 antibody genes, are known to persons of skill. Examples of these techniques and instructions sufficient to direct persons of skill through many cloning exercises are found in Berger and Kimmel, Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, Methods in Enzymology volume 152 Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif. (Berger); Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning\u2014A Laboratory Manual (2nd ed.)

Ausubel et al., eds., Current Protocols, a joint venture between Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., (1994 Supplement) (Ausubel). Methods of producing recombinant immunoglobulins are also known in the art. See, Cabilly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Queen et al. (1989) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 86: 10029-10033., 123888=To further increase affinity, mutant C6.5 phage antibody libraries can be created where the other CDRs are randomized (VL CDR1 and CDR2 and VH CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). Each CDR is randomized in a separate library, using, for example, C6ML3-9 as a template (Kd=1.0\ufffd10\u22129 M). In a preferred embodiment, CDRs can be sequentially randomized, using the highest affinity sFv as the template for the next round of mutagenesis. This approach would be preferred when mutating CDRs that pack on each other, for example VL and VH CDR3. In another embodiment, CDRs could be mutated in parallel, and mutations combined to achieve an additive effect on affinity. This approach has been used to increase the affinity of human growth hormone (hGH) for the growth hormone receptor over 1500 fold from 3.4\ufffd10\u221210 to 9.0\ufffd10\u221213 M (Lowman et al. (1993) J. Mol. Biol, 234: 564-578., 169593=If covalent bonding between a compound and the surface is desired, the surface will usually be polyfunctional or be capable of being polyfunctionalized. Functional groups which may be present on the surface and used for linking can include carboxylic acids, aldehydes, amino groups, cyano groups, ethylenic groups, hydroxyl groups, mercapto groups and the like. The manner of linking a wide variety of compounds to various surfaces is well known and is amply illustrated in the literature. See, for example, Immobilized Enzymes, Ichiro Chibata, Halsted Press, New York, 1978, and Cuatrecasas, J. Biol, Chem. 245 3059 (1970)., 398423=As described above, to further increase affinity, the sequences of the two highest affinity sFv obtained from the VH CDR3B library (C6MH3-B1 or C6MH3-B47) were combined with the sequences of sFv isolated from the C6VHCDR3D library (C6MH3-D1, -D2, -D3, -D5, or -D6). An increase in affinity from wild-type was obtained for all these combinations, yielding an sFv (C6-B1D3) that had a 1230 fold lower Kd than wt C6.5 (Table 16). The extent of additivity varied considerably, however, and could not be predicted from the parental kon, koff, or Kd. In some combinations, cooperativity was observed, with a negative \u0394\u0394GI. Additional combinations were made between a previously described light chain shuffled C6.5 mutant (C6L1, sixfold decreased Kd) and one of two VL CDR3 mutants (C6ML3-9 and CML-3-12). These combinations yielded sFv with 49 and 84 fold improved affinity (Table 16). Introducing the same rearranged VL gene into the highest affinity VH CDR3 mutants (C6MH3-B1 or C6MH3-B47) resulted in decreased affinity compared to C6MH3-B1 (Table 5)., 195038=The C6.5 sFv was labeled with radioiodine using the CT method (DeNardo et al. (1986) Nud. Med. Biol., 13: 303-310). Briefly, 1.0 mg of protein was combined with 125I (14-17 mCi/mg) (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.), or 131I (9.25 mCi/mg) (DuPont NEN, Wilmington, Del.) at an iodine to protein ratio of 1:10. 10 \u03bcg of CT (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) was added per 100 \u03bcg of protein and the resulting mixture was incubated for three minutes at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 \u03bcg of sodium metabisulfite (Sigma) per 100 \u03bcg of protein. Unincorporated radioiodine was separated from the labeled protein by gel filtration using the G-50-80 centrifuged-column method (Adams et al. (1993) Cancer Res. 53: 4026-4034). The final sac activity of the CT labeling was 1.4 mCi/mg for the 131I-6.5 sFv and typically about 1.0 mCi/mg for the 125I-C6.5 sFv., 193514=The Kd of C6.5 and 74IF8 sFv were determined using surface plasmon resonance in a BIAcore Pharmacia) and by Scatchard analysis. In a BIAcore flow cell, 1400 resonance units (RU) of c-erbB-2 ECD (25 \u03bcg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5) was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (Johnsson, B. et al., (1991) Anal. Biochem., 198:268-277). Association and dissociation of C6.5 and 741F8 sFv (100 nM-600 nM) were measured under continuous flow of 5 \u03bcl/min. Rate constant kon was determined from a plot of (1n (dR/dt))/t vs concentration (Karlsson et al. (1991) J. Immunol. Meth., 145: 229-240). Rate constant koff was determined from the dissociation part of the sensorgram at the highest concentration of sFv analyzed (Johnsson et al. (1991) Anal. Biochem., 198: 268-277). The Kd of C6.5 was also determined by Scatchard analysis (Scatchard (1949) Annal. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 51: 660). All assays were performed in triplicate. Briefly, 50 \u03bcg of radioiodinated sFv was added to 5\ufffd106 SK-OV-3 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled sFv from the same preparation. After a 30 minute incubation at 20\ufffd C., the samples were washed with PBS at 40\ufffd C. and centrifuged at 500 g. The amount of labeled sFv bound to the cells was determined by counting the pellets in a gamma counter and the Ka , and Kd were calculated using the EBDA program (V 2.0, G. A. McPherson, 1983)., 188910=To screen for binding, 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon 3912) were coated overnight at 4\ufffd C. with 10 \u03bcg/ml c-erbB-2 ECD in PBS, blocked for 2 h at 37\ufffd C. with 2% milk powder in PBS, and incubated for 1.5 hours at 20\ufffd C. with 50 4l of the E.coli supernatant containing sFv. Binding of soluble sFv to antigen was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (9E1O) which recognizes the C-terminal myc peptide tag (Munro, S. et al., (1986) Cell, 46:291-300) and peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse Fc antibody (Sigma) using ABTS as substrate (Ward et al. (1989) Nature, 341: 544-546). The reaction was stopped after 30 min with NaF (3.2 mg/ml) and the A405 nm measured. Unique clones were identified by PCR fingerprinting (Marks, J. D. et al., (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597) and DNA sequencing. The specificity of each unique sFv was determined by ELISA performed as described above with wells coated with 10 \u03bcg/ml of bovine serum albumin, hen egg white lysozyme, bovine glutamyltranspeptidase, c-erbB-2 ECD, VCS M13 (3.5\ufffd1012/ml) and casein (0.5%). For ELISA with biotinylated c-erbB-2 ECD, microtiter plates (Immunolon 4, Dynatech) were coated with 50 \u03bcl immunopure avidin (Pierce; 10 \u03bcg/ml in PBS) overnight at 4\ufffd C., blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37\ufffd C. and incubated with 50\u03bc biotinylated c-erbB-2 extracellular domain (5 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 min at 20\ufffd C. To prepare biotinylated antigen, 0.2 ml c-erbB-2 ECD (1 mg/ml in PBS) was incubated with 0.5 mM NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) overnight at 4\ufffd C. and then purified on a presto desalting column (Pierce)., 306253=To facilitate purification of sFv selected from the C6VLCDR3 library, the sFv genes were subcloned into the expression vector pUC119 Sfi-NotmycHis, which results in the addition of a hexa-histidine tag at the C-terminal end of the sFv. The sFv selected from the C6VHCDR3 library already have a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag and therefore could be purified without subcloning. 500 ml cultures of E. coli TG1 harboring one of the C6.5 mutant phagemids were grown, expression of sFv induced (De Bellis et al. (1990) supra.), and the culture grown at 25\ufffd C. overnight. Single-chain Fv were harvested from the periplasm (Breitling et al. (1991) supra.), dialyzed overnight at 4\ufffd C. against 8 L of IMAC loading buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) and then filtered through a 0.2 micron filter. Single-chain Fv was purified by IMAC (Hochuli et al. (1988) Bio/Technology, 6: 1321-1325) as described above., 359004=Five sFv were isolated that had a koff 2.5 to 3.75 fold lower than C6ML3-9, however expression levels were too low to obtain adequate purified sFv for measurement of the Kd (last five sequences, Table 14, library B). The next best results were obtained from library D (Table 14). Five higher affinity sFv were isolated, with the best having a Kd sevenfold higher than wt C6ML3-9. An additional sFv was isolated that had a koff lower than wt sFv, however the expression level was too low to obtain adequate purified sFv for measurement of the Kd (last sequence, Table 14, library D). There was selection for a consensus mutation of Y100kW and replacement of F1001 with hydrophobic methionine or leucine. No higher affinity sFv were isolated from either the A or C libraries. From library A, 8/10 sFv were wild-type, with one higher affinity sFv, a contaminant from library B. A single mutant sFv with the conservative replacement of Y99F had an apparent koff 2.5 times lower than wt, but expression levels were too low to obtain adequate purified sFv to measure the Kd. From library C, 8/10 sFv were wt sFv, with one higher affinity sFv having mutations located in the VH and VL genes, but not in the region intentionally mutated. The isolated mutant sFv K100gV had a Kd 2.7 fold lower than wt (koff 3.8 fold lower than C6ML3-9), correlating with the data of the alanine scan, in which K100gA was the only sFv with decreased koff., 27155=The invention was made by or under a contract with the following agencies of the United States Government: Army Grant No. DAMD17-94-J4433 and the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Grant No. U01 CA51880., 163058=Other proteins capable of specifically binding immunoglobulin constant regions, such as streptococcal protein A or protein G are also used as the labeling agent. These proteins are normal constituents of the cell walls of streptococcal bacteria. They exhibit a strong non immunogenic reactivity with immunoglobulin constant regions from a variety of species. See, generally Kronval, et at., (1973) J. Immunol., 111:1401-1406, and Akerstrom, et al., (1985) J. Immunol., 135:2589-2542., 238917=Screening of sFv by dissociation rate constant (koff) was performed using real-time biospecific interaction analysis based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in a BlAcore (Pharmacia). Typically 24 ELISA positive clones from each of the final two rounds of selection were screened. A 10 ml culture of E. coli TG1 containing the appropriate phagemid was grown and expression of sFv induced with IPTG (De Bellis and Schwartz, 1990). Cultures were grown overnight at 25\ufffd C., sFv harvested from the periplasm ,(Breitling et al. (1991) Gene 104, 147-153), and the periplasmic fraction dialyzed for 24 h against HEPES buffered saline (10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, HBS). In a BIAcore flow cell, approximately 1400 resonance units (RU) of c-erbB-ECD (25 \u03bcg/ml) in 10 mM acetate buffer pH 4.5 were coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (Johnsson et al. (1991) Anal. Biochem. 198, 268-277). Association and dissociation of undiluted sFv in the periplasmic fraction was measured under a constant flow of 5 \u03bcl/min. An apparent dissociation rate constant (koff) was determined from the dissociation part of the sensorgram for each sFv analyzed (Karlsson et al. (1991) J. Immunol. Methods 145, 229-240). Typically 30 to 40 samples were measured during a single BIAcore run, with C6.5 periplasmic preparations analyzed as the first and final samples to ensure stability during the run. The flow cell was regenerated between samples using 2.6 M MgCl2 in 10 mM glycine, pH 9.5 without significant change in the sensorgram baseline after analysis of more than 100 samples., 28675=Despite these promising results, the use of immunotoxins in humans has been limited by toxicity, immunogenicity and a failure to identify highly specific tumor antigens (Byers et al. Cancer Res., 49: 6153). Nonspecific toxicity results from the failure of the monoclonal antibody to bind specifically and with high affinity to tumor cells. As a result, nonspecific cell killing occurs. In addition, the foreign immunotoxin molecule elicits a strong immune response in humans. The immunogenicity of the toxin portion of the immunotoxin has recently been overcome by using the human analog of RNase (Rybak et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., USA, 89: 3165 (1992)). The murine antibody portion, however, is still significantly immunogenic (Sawler et al., J. Immunol., 135: 1530 (1985))., 186493=Phage expressing sFv which bound c-arbB-2 were selected by panning the phage library on immobilize c-erbB-2 ECD (Marks et al. (1991) supra.). Briefly, immunotubes (Nunc, Maxisorb) were coated with 2 ml (100 1 \u03bcg/ml) c-erbB-2 ECD in PBS overnight at 20\ufffd C. and blocked with 2% milk powder in PBS for 2 h at 37\ufffd C. 1 ml of the phage solution (approximately 1013 phage) was added to the tubes and incubated at 20\ufffd C. with tumbling on an over and under turntable for 2 h. Nonbinding phage were eliminated by sequential washing (15 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween followed by 15 times with PBS). Binding phage were then eluted from the immunotubes by adding 1 ml of 100 mM triethylamine, incubating for 10 min at 20\ufffd C., transferring the solution to a new tube, and neutralizing with 0.5 ml 1M Tris HCl, PH 7.4. Half of the eluted phage solution was used to infect 10 ml of E.coli TG1 (Gibson, T. J. (1984) Studies on the Epstein-Barr virus genome, Cambridge University Ph.D. thesis; Carter et al. (1985) Nucleic Acids Res., 13: 4431-4443) grown to an A600 nm of 0.8-0.9. After incubation for 30 min at 37\ufffd C., bacteria were plated on TYE plates containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 1 % glucose and grown overnight at 37\ufffd C. Phage were rescued and concentrated as described above and used for the next selection round. The selection process was repeated for a total of 5 rounds., 304838=Ranking of sFv by koff was performed using SPR in a BIAcore as described above. Briefly, 10 ml cultures of 24 ELISA positive clones from the third and fourth round of selection were grown to an A600 of approximately 0.8, sFv expression induced (De Bellis et al. (1990). Nucleic Acids Res., 18: 1311) and the culture grown overnight at 25\ufffd C. Single-chain Fv were harvested from the periplasm (Breitling et al. (1991) Gene, 104: 147-153), and the periplasmic fraction dialyzed for 48 h against hepes buffered saline (10 mM hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, HBS). In a BIAcore flow cell, approximately 1400 resonance units (RU) of c-erbB-2 ECD were coupled to a CM5 sensor chip using NHS-EDC chemistry (Johnsson et al. (1991) Anal. Biochem. 198: 268-277). Association and dissociation of undiluted sFv in the periplasmic fraction were measured under a constant flow of 5 \u03bcl/min and HBS as running buffer. An apparent koff was determined from the dissociation part of the sensorgram for each sFv analyzed (Karlsson et al. (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 166: 75-84). The flow cell was regenerated between samples using sequential injections of 4 M MgCl2 and 100 mM triethylamine without significant change in the sensorgram baseline after analysis of more than 100 samples., 131748=C6.5 based Fab are expressed in E. coli using an expression vector similar to the one described by Better et. al. (Better et al. (1988) Science, 240: 1041-1043). To create a C6.5 based Fab, the VH and VL genes are amplified from the sFv using PCR. The VH gene is cloned into a PUC119 based bacterial expression vector which provides the human IgG CH1 domain downstream from, and in frame with, the VH gene. The vector also contains the lac promoter, a pelb leader sequence to direct expressed VH-CH1 domain into the periplasm, a gene 3 leader sequence to direct expressed light chain into the periplasm, and cloning sites for the light chain gene. Clones containing the correct VH gene are identified, e.g., by PCR fingerprinting. The VL gene is spliced to the CL gene using PCR and cloned into the vector containing the VH CH1 gene., 241316=Single-chain Fv was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography IMAC) (Hochuli et al. (1988) Bio/Technology, 6, 1321-1325) as described in Example 1. To remove dimeric and aggregated sFv, samples were concentrated to a volume <1 ml in a Centricon 10 (Amicon) and fractionated on a Superdex 75 column using a running buffer of HBS. The purity of the final preparation was evaluated by assaying an aliquot by SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were detected by Coomassie staining. The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically assuming an A280 nm of 1.0 corresponds to an sFv concentration of 0.7 mg/ml., 68640=Since the antibody fragments on the surface of the phage are functional, phage bearing antigen binding antibody fragments can be separated from non-binding or lower affinity phage by antigen affinity chromatography (McCafferty et al. (1990) Nature, 348: 552-554). Mixtures of phage are allowed to bind to the affinity matrix, non-binding or lower affinity phage are removed by washing, and bound phage are eluted by treatment with acid or alkali. Depending on the affinity of the antibody fragment, enrichment factors of 20 fold-1,000,000 fold are obtained by single round of affinity selection. By infecting bacteria with the eluted phage, however, more phage can be grown and subjected to another round of selection. In this way, an enrichment of 1000 fold in one round becomes 1,000,000 fold in two rounds of selection (McCafferty et al. (1990) Nature, 348: 552-554). Thus, even when enrichments in each round are low (Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol, 222: 581-597), multiple rounds of affinity selection leads to the isolation of rare phage and the genetic material contained within which encodes the sequence of the binding antibody. The physical link between genotype and phenotype provided by phage display makes it possible to test every member of an antibody fragment library for binding to antigen, even with libraries as large as 100,000,000 clones. For example, after multiple rounds of selection on antigen, a binding sFv that occurred with a frequency of only 1/30,000,000 clones was recovered (Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol, 222: 581-597)., 415437=The retention of the C6.5 diabody in scid mice bearing subcutaneous SK-OV-3 tumors was compared to C6.5. Single chain Fv were radio-iodinated using the chloramine-T method, and 25 \u03bcg injected into mice. Values are shown in Table 17 and plotted in FIG. 4. At 24 hours, tumor retention was 6.48% of the injected dose/gm of tumor, compared to 0.98% for C6.5. Tumor:blood ratios were 9.7:1 for the diabody and 19.6:1 for the C6.5 sFv. Significant amounts (1.41%) of the diabody was retained at 72 hours. The total area under the curve (AUC) for tumor:blood was 2.3:1., 58617=Examples of techniques sufficient to direct persons of skill through in vitro amplification methods, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the ligase chain reaction (LCR), Q\u03b2-replicase amplification and other RNA polymerase mediated techniques are found in Berger, Sambrook, and Ausubel, as well as Mullis et al., (1987) U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202; PCR Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications (Innis et al. eds) Academic Press Inc. San Diego, Calif. (1990) (Innis); Arnheim & Levinson (Oct. 1, 1990) C&EN 36-47; The Journal of NIH Research (1991) 3, 81-94; (Kwoh et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 1173; Guatelli et al. (1990) Proc. Natl.

Improved methods of cloning in vitro amplified nucleic acids are described in Wallace et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,426,039., 135763=The PE molecules can be fused to the C6 antibody by recombinant means. The genes encoding protein chains may be cloned in cDNA or in genomic form by any cloning procedure known to those skilled in the art. See for example Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, (1989). Methods of cloning genes encoding PE fused to various ligands are well known to those of skill in the art. See, for example, Siegall et al., FASEB J., 3: 2647-2652 (1989); Chaudhary et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84: 4538-4542 (1987)., 64518=In a preferred embodiment the C6 antibody gene (e.g. C6.5 sFv gene) is subcloned into the expression vector pUC119Sfi/NotHismyc, which is identical to the vector described by Griffiths et al., EMBO J., 13: 3245-3260 (1994), (except for the elimination of an XBaI restriction site). This results in the addition of a hexa-histidine tag at the C-terminal end of the sFv. A pHEN-1 vector DNA containing the C6.5 sFv DNA is prepared by alkaline lysis miniprep, digested with NcoI and NotI, and the sFv DNA purified on a 1.5% agarose gel. The C6 sFv DNA is ligated into pUC119Sfi1/Not1Hismyc digested with NcoI and NotI and the ligation mixture used to transform electrocompetent E.coli HB2151. For expression, 200 ml of 2\ufffdTY media containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.1% glucose is inoculated with E.coli HB2151 harboring the C6 gene in pUC119Sfi1/Not1Hismyc. The culture is grown at 37\ufffd C. to an A600 nm of 0.8. Soluble sFv is expression induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM, and the culture is grown at 30\ufffd C. in a shaker flask overnight., 190595=To facilitate purification, the C6.5 sFv gene was subcloned into the expression vector pUC119Sfi/NotHismyc (Griffiths, et al. (1994) EMBO J., 13: 3245-3260) which results in the addition of a hexa-histidine tag at the C-terminal end of the sFv. Briefly, pHEN-1 vector DNA containing the C6.5 sFv DNA was prepared by alkaline lysis milliprep, digested with NcoI and NotI, and the sFv DNA purified on a 1.5% agarose gel. C6.5 sFv DNA was ligated into pUC119Sfil/NotIHismyc digested with NcoI and NotI and the legation mixture used to transform electrocompetent E. coli HB-2151. For expression, 200 ml of 2\ufffdTY media containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 0.1% glucose was inoculated with E. coli HB-2151 harboring the C6.5 gene in pUC119Sfil/NotIHismyc. The culture was grown at 37\ufffd C. to an A.600 nm of 0.8, soluble sFv expression induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM, and the culture grown at 30\ufffd C. in a shaker flask overnight. Single-chain Fv was harvested from the periplasm using the following protocol. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 g for 15 min, resuspended in 10 ml of ice cold 30 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 20% sucrose, and incubated on ice for 20 min. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 g for 15 min. and the \u201cperiplasmic fraction\u201d cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 g for 20 min. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4\ufffd C. against 8 L of IMAC loading buffer (30 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) and then filtered through a 0.2 micron filter., 61128=To obtain high levels of expression of a cloned nucleic acid it is common to construct expression plasmids which typically contain a strong promoter to direct transcription, a ribosome binding site for translational initiation, and a transcription/translation terminator. Examples of regulatory regions suitable for this purpose in E. coli are the promoter and operator region of the E. coli tryptophan biosynthetic pathway as described by Yanofsky, C., 1984, J. Bacteriol., 158:1018-1024 and the leftward promoter of phage lambda (PI) as described by Herskowitz and Hagen, 1980, Ann. Rev. Genet., 14:399-445. The inclusion of selection markers in DNA vectors transformed in E. coli is also useful. Examples of such markers include genes specifying resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol. See Sambrook for details concerning selection markers, e.g., for use in E. coli., 233709=The light chain shuffled library was selected using immunotubes (Nunc; Maxisorb) coated with 2 ml c-erbB-2 ECD (25 \u03bcg/ml) in PBS overnight at room temperature (Marks et at. (1991) supra). The tube was blocked for 1 h at 37\ufffd C. with 2% skimmed milk powder in PBS (2% MPBS) and the selection, washing, and elution were performed as described (Marks et al. (1991), supra) using phage at a concentration of 5.0\ufffd1012/ml. One third of the eluted phage was used to infect 1 ml log phase E. coli TG1, which were plated on TYE-AMP-GLU plates and described above. The rescue-selection-plating cycle was repeated 3 times, after which clones were analyzed for binding by ELISA., 198110=Four to six week old C.BI7/Icr-scid mice were obtained from the Fox Chase Cancer Center Laboratory Animal Facility. 2.5\ufffd106 SK-OV-3 cells in log phase were implanted s.c. on the abdomens of the mice. After about 7 weeks the tumors had achieved sizes of 100-200 mg and Lugol's solution was placed in the drinking water to block thyroid accumulation of radioiodine. Three days later, biodistribution studies were initiated. 125I-C6.5 sFv was diluted in PBS to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and each mouse was given 100 \u03bcL, containing 20 \u03bcg of radiopharmaceutical, by tail vein injection. Total injected doses were determined by counting each animal on a Series 30 multichannel analyzer/probe system (probe model #2007, Canaberra, Meridian, Conn.). Blood samples and whole body counts of the mice were obtained at regular intervals. Groups of 8 mice were sacrificed at 24 h after injection and the tumors and organs removed, weighed and counted in a gamma counter to determine the %ID/g (Adams et al. (1993) supra.; Adams et al. (1992) Antibody Immunoconj. and Radiopharm., 5: 81-95). The mean and standard error of the mean (SEW) for each group of data were calculated, and T:O ratios determined. Significance levels were determined using Students t-test., 185152=Phage were prepared from a phagemid library (3\ufffd107 members) expressing sFv as pIII fusions on the phage surface (Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597). The library was created from a repertoire of sFv genes consisting of human heavy and light chain variable region (VH and VI) genes isolated from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of unimmunized human volunteers. To rescue phagemid particles from the library, 50 ml of 2\ufffdTY media containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose were inoculated with 10: bacteria taken from the frozen library glycerol stock. The culture was grown at 37\ufffd C. with shag to an A nm of 0.8, 7.0\ufffd1011 colony forming units of VCS-MI3 (Stratgene) added, and incubation continued at 37\ufffd C. for 1 h without shaking followed by 1 h with shaking. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4500 g for 10 min, resuspended in 200 ml of 2\ufffdTY media containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 2.5 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin and grown overnight at 37\ufffd C. Phage particles were purified and concentrated by 2 polyethylene glycol precipitations and resuspended in PBS (25 mM NaH2PO4, 125 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) to approximately 1011 transducing units/ml ampicillin resistant clones.}",
