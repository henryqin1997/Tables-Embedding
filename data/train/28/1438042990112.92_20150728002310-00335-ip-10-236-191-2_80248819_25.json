In situations where the response bytes are single-bytes, the response buffer is populated to the maximum and can pack 255*200=51000 bytes for each round trip. For responses containing multi-byte data, the byte packing for each row could be less than ideal resulting in lesser bytes getting transferred for each round trip. If your application generates large pages frequently and the response does not fit in one round trip, then consider setting this parameter higher. The memory usage for the mod_plsql module will increase., 255391=To define monthly frequency, the keyword Everymonth is used. The cleanup starts on the Saturday of the month at the time defined.
