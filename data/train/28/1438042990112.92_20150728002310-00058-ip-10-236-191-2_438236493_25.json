            "CHANGING LEVELS OF QUALITY OF SERVICE - A first network device is configured to receive information regarding a quality of service application that is part of an application stored on a device. The first network device is configured to further receive a request for a network to apply the level of quality service to the application stored on the device. The first network device is configured to further send an authorization request to the second network device. The first network device is configured to further receive an authorization result from the second network device. The first network device is configured send a first message to a third network device and receiving a response from the third network device that the level of quality of service is applied to the information; and send a message to the provider that the level of quality of service is applied to the information.",
            "USER DEVICE STATUS INFORMATION SYSTEM - A device may receive a request for information associated with a status of a user device from an application server device. The device may determine, based on the request, whether the user device is connected to a first network and may provide a first response to the application server device when the user device is connected to the first network. The first response may indicate that the user device is connected to the first network. When the user device is not connected to a first network, the device may determine whether the user device is connected to a second network that is different than the first network. When the user device is connected to the second network, the device may provide a second response to the application server device. The second response may indicate that the user device is connected to the second network.",
            "Extended OAuth Architecture - Method, device, and storage medium to receive a request to authorize a release of protected resource data, wherein the request includes one or more indicators that indicate one or more instances of the protected resource data being requested; identify a sensitivity level for each indicator of the protected resource data; determine whether the one or more indicators of the protected resource data require consent from a resource owner of the protected resource data; transmit a request, to a user device associated with the resource owner, for consent from the resource owner in response to a determination that at least one of the one or more indicators require consent from the resource owner; generate an authorization code in response to receiving consent from the resource owner; and transmit, to the sending device of the request, the authorization code.",
            "Extended OAuth Architecture Supporting Multiple Types of Consent Based on Multiple Scopes and Contextual Information - Method, device, and storage medium to receive a request to authorize a release of protected resource data, wherein the request includes a device identifier that identifies a requesting device of the request and one or more indicators that indicate one or more instances of the protected resource data being requested; identify a sensitivity level for each indicator of the protected resource data; identify, based on the device identifier, contextual information that indicates a preferred type of consent of the requesting device in response to a determination that at least one of the one or more indicators require consent from a resource owner of the protected resource data; select a type of consent based on the contextual information and the one or more sensitivity levels; and transmit a request, to a user device associated with the resource owner, for consent from the resource owner according to the type of consent."

The first server may provide information regarding the geographic area to the third server to receive the information identifying the one or more user devices in the geographic area. 20140129628 Published Description Patent application number Hugh H. Fletcher, Mountain View, CA US 05-09-2013 LOCATION-BASED BROADCAST MESSAGING TO MOBILE DEVICES LOCATED IN OR ENTERING INTO A DEFINED GEOGRAPHIC AREA - For a location-based broadcast messaging service, a broadcast server receives a broadcast request from a business application server. The broadcast request includes a message, at least one identifier for target mobile devices, and an identifier for a location. The broadcast server sends a location query including the identifier for",

There is no central authority though which all process messages and state updates must pass and which thereby may create a system bottleneck and limit system growth. The computer system is scalable and system operation remains efficient with increasing numbers of network nodes. 05-08-2014 Julia Fletcher, Carlsbad, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20080248565 ISOLATED PHOSPHOLIPID-PROTEIN PARTICLES - Systems and methods are provided for producing a protein of interest that is typically not amenable to expression in soluble form in in vitro expression systems. In some aspects, the invention provides methods of synthesizing proteins using in vitro protein synthesis systems that include a scaffold protein such as apolipoprotein or an amphipathic alpha helix containing (\u201cAAHC\u201d) protein, in which higher yields of soluble protein are produced than in the absence of the scaffold protein. The scaffold proteins may be provided in an in vitro protein synthesis system associated with lipid or not associated with lipid. The scaffold protein may be provided as a protein per se or may be encoded by",
