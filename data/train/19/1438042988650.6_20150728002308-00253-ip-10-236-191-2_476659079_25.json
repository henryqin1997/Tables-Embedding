Then, a stainless steel ring with a diameter of 7.22 cm and a height of 2.54 cm was placed on the test specimen, and about 40 mL of cat food (original chicken manufactured by IAMS, ground in a laboratory mill, with a crude fat content of at least 21%) was loaded into the ring. Further, a stainless steel cone having a diameter of 7.20 cm and a weight of 1452.5 g was put on the pet food in the ring, and the whole was kept in a thermohygrostat at a temperature of 60\ufffd C. and a humidity of 65% RH for 15 hours., 86354=A pulp containing LBKP (=bleached hardwood kraft pulp)/NBKP (=bleached softwood kraft pulp) in a 7/3 mass ratio with a freeness of 400 mL c.s.f was adjusted to a solid content of 1.0 mass % and formed by hand into a paper sheet having a basis weight of about 50 g/cm2 by means of a paper machine and dried at 100\ufffd C. for 100 seconds over a drum dryer to give test specimens (c.s.f. stands for Canadian Standard Freeness, which is the unit of the amount of water drained from 1000 mL of an aqueous pulp dispersion through a predetermined filtration machine)., 88594=Test solutions adjusted to a solid content of 1 mass % with deionized water were used. 300 g of the test solutions were heated to 40\ufffd C., then stirred for 5 minutes with a mixer at 2500 rpm and filtered through black doeskin cloth, and the cloth was examined with the naked eye for the reminder on the cloth and rated on a 5-grade scale from 5 for no reminder to 1. A figure accompanied with - means that the rating is little short of the figure., 78505=An uncoated paper underlay (ADNANTEC filter paper 1, 10 cm\ufffd10 cm) was placed on the surface of a flat metal plate, and an uncoated paper sheet (4A, 10 cm\ufffd10 cm) with a grid of 100 small squares printed thereon and then a test specimen (10 cm\ufffd10 cm) were laid over. Then, a stainless steel ring with a diameter of 7.22 cm and a height of 2.54 cm was placed on the test specimen, and 20 g of cat food (PURINA, product name: FRYSKIES) was loaded into the ring. Further, a stainless steel cone having a diameter of 7.20 cm and a weight of 1452.5 g was put on the pet food in the ring, and the whole was kept in a thermohygrostat at a temperature of 60\ufffd C. and a humidity of 70% RH for 24 hours., 55242=Polymerization initiator (e): an azo compound or an azoamidine compound which, itself or when decomposed, has an acute oral toxicity of at least 1000 mg/kg in rats or mice and a 10-hour half-life temperature of 30\ufffd C. or above., 81933=Water repellency was evaluated (in accordance with JAPAN TAPPI test methods for paper and pulp No. 68:2000 on the scale shown in Table 2).
