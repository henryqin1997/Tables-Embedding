    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{20235=Dr. John Singler suggests that Creole was probably formed between the time the French colony of Saint-Domingue was founded in 1659 and 1740. It was during this period that the colony moved from tobacco and cotton production to a mostly sugar-based economy, which created a favorable setting for the Creole language to form. At the time of tobacco and cotton production, the Haitian population was made up of colonists, the engag\u00e9s (employed whites), people of color and slaves in relatively balanced proportions, with roughly equal numbers of people of color and engag\u00e9s. Singler estimates the economy shifted into sugar production in 1690, and radically reconfigured the early Haitian people as \"the big landowners drove out the small ones, while the number of slaves exploded\". Prior to this economic shift, engag\u00e9s were favored over slaves as they were felt to be easier to control.[12] However, the sugar crop required a much larger labour force, and larger numbers of slaves were brought in. As the coloured slaves had decreasing contact with native French-speaking whites, the language would have begun to change.[13], 23745=Over 90% of the Haitian Creole vocabulary is of French origin. However, most French speakers might find it unintelligible at first since the vocabulary between the two languages have diverged somewhat. Creole has many French words used in an older sense or style, meanings which have changed or have been replaced over time in Standard French. An example of this would be in the sentence, \"Ki jan ou rele?\" (What is your name?); corresponding to the Standard French salutation, \"Comment vous appelez-vous?\" Although the average French person would not understand this phrase, every word shown is of French origin. The words, qui (\"what\"), genre (manner), vous (you), h\u00e9ler (to call) or as in \"What manner call (yourself)?\". The verb \"h\u00e9ler\" has been replaced by \"appeler\" in Standard French.[4], 50429=Haitian Creole grammar is highly analytical: for example, verbs are not inflected for tense or person, and there is no grammatical gender\u2014meaning that adjectives and articles are not inflected according to the noun. The primary word order (SVO) is the same as in French., 16330=Haiti has had constant political turmoil, but despite this there were some significant steps taken and one was to raise the status of the Creole language. In the early 1940s under President \u00c9lie Lescot, attempts were made to standardize the language. Lescot brought in two American linguistic experts, Frank Laubach and H. Ormond McConnell, to develop a standardized Creole orthography. However, the orthography was not well received although some regarded it highly.[8] Its official orthography was standardized in 1979. The Constitution of 1979 classified French as the \"langue d'instruction\" or language of instruction, and Creole was classified as an \"outil d'enseignement\" or a tool of education. The more recent Constitution of 1987 recognizes Creole as the \"sole language that unites all Haitians\". It is in this Constitution that Creole and French are both recognized as the official languages of Haiti.[9] The use of Haitian Creole in literature has been small but is increasing. Even without government recognition by the end of the 1800s, there were already significant literary texts written in Haitian Creole such as Oswald Durand's \"Choucoune\" and Georges Sylvain's \"Cric?\" \"Crac!\".[10] F\u00e9lix Morisseau-Leroy was one of the first and most influential authors to write in Haitian Creole. Since the 1980s, many educators, writers and activists have written literature in Haitian Creole. More recently, on October 28, 2004 on the country's newly instated \"Creole Day\" Haiti's official newspaper \"Le Matin\" published its first paper entirely in Haitian Creole.[10] Today numerous newspapers, as well as radio and television programs, are produced in Haitian Creole., 19038=As required by the Joseph C. Bernard (Secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat de l'\u00e9ducation nationale) law of 18 September 1979,[11] the Institut P\u00e9dagogique National established an official orthography for Krey\u00f2l, and slight modifications were made over the next two decades. For example, the hyphen (-) is no longer used, nor is the apostrophe. The only accent accepted is the grave accent (\u00e0, \u00e8, or \u00f2)., 47517=The first technical orthography for Haitian Creole was developed in 1940 by Ormonde McConnell. It was later revised with the help of Frank Laubach, resulting in the creation of what is known as the McConnell-Laubach orthography.[15], 133724=After the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti in 2010, international help badly needed translation tools for communicating in Haitian Creole. Furthermore, international organizations had little idea whom to contact as translators. As an emergency measure, Carnegie Mellon University released data for its own research into the public domain.[21] Microsoft Research and Google Translate have implemented alpha version machine translators based on the Carnegie Mellon data.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The Fon language, a modern subdivision of the Gbe language that was used in colonial centuries, is often used to compare grammatical structure between Haitian Creole and to relexify it with vocabulary from the French language.[14] The fact that the equivalent of the definite article (\"the\") also comes after the noun as in Creole, instead of before surely heightens its case. Although to be noted, the usage in Popular French, is similar as well. An example of this would be in the following words denoting the noun using a definitive article: Over 90% of the Haitian Creole vocabulary is of French origin.

    "textAfterTable": "Note that the l\u00e0 (there) in Popular French, is added after the noun for emphasis, comparable to the English \"that there house\"'. Another theory suggests[by whom?] that a creole had already started to develop on West African trading posts before the importation of African slaves into the Americas, and that since many of those slaves were being kept for some amount of time near these trading posts before being sent to the Caribbean, they would have learned a rudimentary creole even before getting there.[citation needed] Orthography and phonology[edit] This article contains IPA phonetic symbols.
