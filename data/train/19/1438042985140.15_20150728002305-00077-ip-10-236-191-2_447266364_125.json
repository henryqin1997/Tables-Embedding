As in previous surveys, a large majority of respondents in June indicated that the volume, persistence, and duration of mark and collateral disputes with each counterparty type included in the survey were little changed over the past three months. A few respondents, however, reported an increase, on net, over the same period in the volume, persistence, and duration of mark and collateral disputes with dealers and other financial intermediaries as well as with mutual funds, ETFs, pension plans, and endowments., 13204=Trading real estate investment trusts. Most respondents to the June survey reported that price and nonprice terms offered to trading real estate investment trusts (REITs) had remained basically unchanged over the past three months.2 A few dealers indicated that price or nonprice terms had eased, with improvement in general market liquidity and functioning the most cited reason for the change. Respondents generally indicated that the use of financial leverage by trading REITs had remained basically unchanged. Most respondents noted that the intensity of efforts by trading REITs to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms was broadly unchanged, but just over one-fifth of dealers reported an increase. Most dealers also found the provision of differential terms to most-favored REIT clients to be broadly unchanged., 6139=Responses to the June survey generally suggested little change over the past three months in the credit terms applicable to important classes of counterparties. As in previous surveys, respondents indicated that most nonprice terms incorporated in new or renegotiated OTC derivatives master agreements were generally unchanged, on balance, during the past three months, although small net fractions of respondents noted a tightening of terms related to the posting of additional margin and the types of acceptable collateral. Dealers also reported that initial margin requirements, which fall outside the scope of the master agreements, were generally little changed over the same period. However, responses to the survey offered several insights regarding recent developments and current areas of focus in dealer-intermediated markets:, 14132=Mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, pension plans, and endowments. Respondents to the June survey indicated that both price and nonprice terms offered to mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pension plans, and endowments had remained basically unchanged over the past three months. A few dealers indicated that either price or nonprice terms had eased somewhat, citing more-aggressive competition from other institutions as the most important reason. Provision of differential terms to most-favored clients and the intensity of efforts by clients to negotiate more-favorable terms were also reported to be little changed, as was the use of financial leverage., 15328=Separately managed accounts established with investment advisers. Similarly, nearly all of the dealers reported in the June survey that price and nonprice terms negotiated by investment advisers on behalf of separately managed accounts were basically unchanged over the past three months. Provision of differential terms to most-favored clients and the use of financial leverage by investment advisers were also reported to be little changed. A few dealers reported an increase in the intensity of efforts by investment advisers to negotiate more-favorable terms., 5041=The June 2013 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three months in credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. In addition to the core set of questions, this survey included a special question asking dealers to characterize the current use of financial leverage by hedge fund clients pursuing specified investment strategies, adopting the pre-crisis peak and post-crisis trough as reference points, and other special questions asking about changes in funding of broad classes of distressed assets by client types. The 22 institutions participating in the survey account for almost all of the dealer financing of dollar-denominated securities to nondealers and are the most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives markets. The survey was conducted during the period from May 21, 2013, to June 3, 2013. The core questions ask about changes between March 2013 and May 2013.1, 12238=Hedge funds. As in March, respondents to the June survey generally indicated that both price terms (such as financing rates) and nonprice terms (including haircuts, maximum maturity, covenants, cure periods, cross-default provisions, or other documentation features) offered to hedge funds for securities financing and OTC derivatives transactions had remained basically unchanged over the past three months. Just over one-fourth of respondents reported an increase in the use of financial leverage by hedge funds over the past three months. (See the exhibit \"Use of Financial Leverage.\") Nearly one-fourth of dealers further noted that there had been an increase in the intensity of efforts by hedge funds to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the same period. A few respondents also noted that the provision of differential terms to most-favored hedge funds had increased somewhat over the same period., 15923=Nonfinancial corporations. Respondents to the June survey indicated that nonprice terms offered to nonfinancial corporations had remained basically unchanged over the past three months. About one-fifth of respondents indicated that they had tightened somewhat the price terms offered to nonfinancial corporations over the past three months, while a few dealers pointed to an easing of price terms. More than one-fourth of respondents reported an increase in the intensity of efforts by nonfinancial corporations to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms., 21624=A special question in the June survey asked dealers to characterize the current use of financial leverage by hedge fund clients, using the pre-crisis peak and post-crisis trough as reference points. Respondents were asked to distinguish between most-favored clients (as a consequence of breadth, duration, and/or extent of relationship) and other clients, and among equity-oriented funds, macro-oriented funds, credit-oriented funds, convertible-bond arbitrage funds, and other fixed-income-oriented relative-value funds. Notable fractions of dealers, ranging between about one-third and about one-half, indicated that current levels of leverage fall roughly in the middle between the peak and trough across specified strategies for both most-favored and other clients. Responses exhibited some dispersion around this middle point. Equity-oriented and macro-oriented funds were most frequently characterized as operating with higher leverage: A net fraction of about one-fifth of dealers reported that equity-oriented and most-favored macro-oriented funds were currently utilizing levels of leverage near to or at the pre-crisis peak, with average clients, particularly those pursuing macro-oriented strategies, described as tapping less financing than most-favored funds. In contrast, a net share of nearly one-third characterized the leverage currently employed by convertible-bond funds as only moderately above or near the trough level., 10712=Dealers and other financial intermediaries. In the June survey, all but one respondent indicated that the amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries remained basically unchanged over the past three months. (See the exhibit \"Management of Concentrated Credit Exposures and Indicators of Supply of Credit.\") The fraction of dealers reporting an increase in the amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries has declined gradually from the 90 percent peak reached in the December 2011 survey., 19806=In the June survey, dealers reported that demand for funding had increased for a number of collateral types. (See the exhibit \"Measures of Demand for Funding and Market Functioning.\") Two-fifths of dealers reported increased demand for funding of non-agency RMBS, while about one-third of respondents pointed to increased demand for funding of high-yield corporate bonds and CMBS. In addition, about one-fifth of dealers reported increased demand for funding of investment-grade corporate bonds. Finally, net fractions of dealers ranging between about one-fifth and about one-fourth reported increased demand for term funding--that is, funding with a maturity of 30 days or more--for CMBS, high-yield corporate bonds, and non-agency RMBS., 14832=Insurance companies. Respondents to the June survey indicated that both price and nonprice terms offered to insurance companies had changed little over the past three months, as had the provision of differential terms to most-favored clients. The use of financial leverage by insurance companies also remained unchanged. A few respondents reported an increase in the intensity of efforts by insurance companies to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms.}",

Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries In some questions, the survey differentiates between the compensation demanded for bearing credit risk (price terms) and the contractual provisions used to mitigate exposures (nonprice terms). If your institution's terms have tightened or eased over the past three months, please so report them regardless of how they stand relative to longer-term norms. Please focus your response on dollar-denominated instruments; if material differences exist with respect to instruments denominated in other currencies, please explain in the appropriate comment space. Where material differences exist across different business areas--for example, between traditional prime brokerage and OTC derivatives--please answer with regard to the business area generating the most exposure and explain in the appropriate comment space. Questions 1 through 40 ask about credit terms applicable to, and mark and collateral disputes with, different counterparty types, considering the entire range of securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives transactions. Question 1 focuses on dealers and other financial intermediaries as counterparties; questions 2 and 3 on central counterparties and other financial utilities; questions 4 through 10 focus on hedge funds; questions 11 through 16 on trading real estate investment trusts (REITs); questions 17 through 22 on mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pension plans, and endowments; questions 23 through 28 on insurance companies; questions",
