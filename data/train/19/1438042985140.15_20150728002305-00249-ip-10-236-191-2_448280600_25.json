            "IMAGE HEATING APPARTUS - An image heating apparatus including: an image heating member, which heats an image on a recording material in a nip portion; an air blower, which blows air toward an air blowing port to cool a predetermined area of the image heating member; and a shutter, which opens and closes the air blowing port, in which the shutter is kept at a closed position when a temperature of the predetermined area of the image heating member is equal to or lower than a predetermined temperature, whereby a temperature rise in a non-sheet passing portion can be efficiently reduced by using the small air blower without lowering the productivity when small-size recording materials are continuously passed nor reducing the lifetime of the air blower.",
            "IMAGE HEATING APPARATUS - An image heating apparatus including: a heating rotary member, which heats an image on a recording material in a nip portion; an air blowing unit, which blows air toward an air blowing port to cool a predetermined area of the heating rotary member; and a shutter, which opens and closes the air blowing port, wherein a cooling operation can be performed continuously with the shutter opened after image heating processing is completed, whereby a downtime required for making the temperature distribution over the entire heating area uniform after the continuous sheet supply of small-size recording materials is reduced remarkably.",

            "IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS - An image forming apparatus includes a plurality of photosensitive drums, and a controller for executing, when an absolute value of a set point of a charged potential is not higher than a predetermined threshold, an operation in a first mode in which charging bias voltages and transfer biases are applied to image regions of the drums, and the charging bias voltages are further applied, and thereafter, image exposures are carried out by exposure members, respectively, and for executing, when the absolute value of the set point of the charged potential is higher than the predetermined threshold, an operation in a second mode in which timings of start of applications of the transfer bias voltages to the transfer members are delayed as compared with those in the first mode, respectively.",
            "IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS - An image forming apparatus includes a controller executing a setting mode for setting a voltage to be applied to an image transfer member when a toner image is transferred onto a transfer medium, so that a predetermined current flows through a charging member when such an area of an image bearing drum as has carried the toner image transferred onto a transfer medium at a transfer portion then passes through a charge portion, the setting being executed on the basis of a current detected by a first detecting member when such a region of the drum as has been charged by the charging member and has been passed through the transfer portion in a state that a test voltage is applied to the transfer member then passes through the charge portion in a period in which no toner image passes through the transfer portion.",
            "IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS - An information forming apparatus includes an execution unit configured to execute a setting mode which sets a voltage to be applied to the transfer member during an image formation operation and a correction mode which corrects the voltage set by the setting mode and a storage unit configured to store in advance a correction current difference based on the environment that is a difference between a current when a predetermined voltage is applied to the transfer member during the first period and a current when a predetermined voltage is applied to the transfer member during the second period. The execution unit corrects the voltage set by the setting mode in accordance with the correction current difference based on a detection result from the first detection member and a detection result from the second detection member in a case that the correction mode is executed during the first period."
