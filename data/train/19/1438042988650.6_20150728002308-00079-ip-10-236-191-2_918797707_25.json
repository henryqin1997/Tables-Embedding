There are many different clubs to join, and there is always some type of activity going on. Mcneese has a very upbeat environment and is great for any person who is optimistic about their future. Tips for prospective students It is important to schedule classes around times that you will be able to attend regularly and on time. If youre not a morning person, then schedule classes in the afternoon. Its ok to have gaps in between classes, and your advisors are always willing to listen to you in case you have any questions about the school . Dont be afraid to ask questions. Bang for the buck You definately get bang for the buck here, there are computer labs that are open all throughout the days that let you print anything that you need, and use their computers for as long as neccessary. They also stay open at night in case you need to get some work done. there are study rooms, and many other different facillities that you may use and there are two student unions halls, that students use for socializing and relaxing. Am enjoying being here",
