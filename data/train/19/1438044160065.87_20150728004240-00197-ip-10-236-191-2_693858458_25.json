The ELDP was first introduced at Lockheed Martin\u2019s site near Denver and the company established an agreement with the University of Denver (DU) by which the University provides graduate degrees for ELDP participants in two aspects of systems engineering: computer systems engineering and mechatronics systems engineering. The degree program in mechatronics systems engineering commenced in January 2005; the program in computer systems engineering 12 months later. The yearly average number chosen for the ELDP program at Denver is about 30.}",
