This is the same management variable used to specify the interval for neighbor solicitation messages during address resolution and neighbor unreachability detection. Use the ipv6 nd ns-interval command to configure the interval between neighbor solicitation messages that are sent during duplicate address detection., 564038=This argument must be in the form documented in RFC 2373 where the address is specified in hexadecimal using 16-bit values between colons., 475327=Specifies the maximum number of entries in the certificate database. The range is from 1 to 1000., 154048=Sets up a single static translation. This argument establishes the local IP address assigned to a host on the inside network. The address could be randomly chosen, allocated from RFC 1918, or obsolete., 496380=(Optional) Sets the maximum key-length value. The range is from 384 to 2048 bits, and the default key-length value is 1024 bits., 496851=The key length is 1024 bits., 841147=56-kbps serial link-Default cost is 1785., 393257=The default lifetime value is 1800 seconds., 254784=Default NS retransmit interval: 1000 msec (1 second), 648818=Reachability can also be established indirectly by using Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) inspection up to the VERIFY_MAX_RETRIES value (the default is 10 seconds). When there is no response, entries are considered stale and are deleted after the stale lifetime value is reached (the default is 1440 minutes)., 894=The following example sets the maximum IPv6 packet size for serial interface 0/1 to 2000 bytes:, 348090=The following example includes the IPv6 prefix 2001:0DB8::/35 in router advertisements sent out Ethernet interface 0/0 with a valid lifetime of 1000 seconds and a preferred lifetime of 900 seconds:, 254328=The interval between IPv6 neighbor solicit transmissions for DAD. The range is from 1000 to 3600000 milliseconds., 236803=The DupAddrDetectTransmits node configuration variable (as specified in RFC 2462, IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) is used to automatically determine the number of consecutive neighbor solicitation messages that are sent on an interface while duplicate address detection is performed on a tentative unicast IPv6 address., 495962=(Optional) Sets the minimum key-length value, which should be at least 384 bits. The range is from 384 to 2048 bits, and the default key-length value is 1024 bits., 42920=This command was introduced on Cisco ASR 1000 series routers., 626605=Stale lifetime: 1440 minutes (24 hours), 363670=All prefixes configured on interfaces that originate IPv6 router advertisements are advertised with a valid lifetime of 2592000 seconds (30 days) and a preferred lifetime of 604800 seconds (7 days), and with both the \"onlink\" and \"autoconfig\" flags set., 404719=The following example configures an IPv6 router advertisement lifetime of 1801 seconds for Ethernet interface 0/0:, 332573=This argument must be in the form documented in RFC 2373 where the address is specified in hexadecimal format using 16-bit values between colons., 96159=This command was integrated into Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1 and implemented on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers., 116005=This argument must be in the form documented in RFC 2373 where the address is specified in hexadecimal using 16-bit values between colons., 455243=The ipv6 nd resolution data limit command allows the customer to configure the number of data packets queued pending Neighbor Discovery resolution. IPv6 Neighbor Discovery queues a data packet that initiates resolution for an unresolved destination. Neighbor Discovery will only queue one packet per destination. Neighbor Discovery also enforces a global (per-router) limit on the number of packets queued. Once the global queue limit is reached, further packets to unresolved destinations are discarded. The minimum (and default) value is 16 packets, and the maximum value is 2048., 397549=The following example configures an IPv6 router advertisement lifetime of 1801 seconds for Ethernet interface 0/0:, 841376=64-kbps serial link-Default cost is 1562., 380000=Maximum interval between IPv6 RA transmissions, in seconds. The range is from 4 to 1800., 709591=Max send value = 2000/250*10 = 80, 499215=The following example sets the minimum key-length value to 512 bits and the maximum value to 1024 bits:, 29291=This command was introduced on Cisco ASR 1000 series routers., 625789=The maximum time, in minutes, a stale entry is kept in the table before it is deleted or some proof of reachability is seen. The range is from 1 to 3600 minutes, and the default is 24 hours (or 1440 minutes)., 709515=2000 spoke-spoke tunnels with 250-second hold timeout, 305034=0 milliseconds (unspecified) is advertised in router advertisements and the value 1000 is used for the neighbor discovery activity of the router itself., 304552=The interval between IPv6 neighbor solicit transmissions for address resolution. The acceptable range is from 1000 to 3600000 milliseconds., 453086=The number of queued data packets. The range is from 16 to 2048 packets., 245=The MTU value configured by using the ipv6 mtu interface configuration command must not be less than 1280 bytes., 367710=The following example includes the IPv6 prefix 2001:0DB8::/35 in router advertisements sent out Ethernet interface 0/0 with a valid lifetime of 1000 seconds, a preferred lifetime of 900 seconds, and both the \"onlink\" and \"autoconfig\" flags set:, 711360=In this case, it could peak at approximately 2000 messages in the first second of the 100-second interval, but it would still be held to 40-messages-per-second average over the 100-second interval. In the second case, it could handle a higher peak rate, but risk a longer period of time when no messages can be sent if it used up its quota for the interval.}",
