            "There are many services on campus to keep you safe. There are many taxi services, campus police, and night rides and walks from late nights at the library for free!",
            "Big part of campus. If you feel that you would like something like that, try it out! But don't worry if it is not your thing, it is not something you have to do.",
            "There are so many on campus! If you can think of it, there is one. But don't feel overwhelmed. There is Festifall which displays all the clubs and organizations so you can check out the ones you like and get more information!",
            "Students who want a challenge. Also, students who want a challenge but love to maintain a social life. Students who want a cultural experience.",
            "Don't walk on the 'M' or you will fail our first blue book! Kiss you crush under West Hall and you will get married.",
            "The University of Michigan is expensive. However, you are receiving an outstanding education for its price. It is a public university and for in-state students it is definitely worth it. Not having money in college does take away from some of the fun, but it is something some people can't avoid. I may not be too happy when I graduate and will have my whole paycheck go to loans. But I would not give up this experience to go somewhere else.",
            "Join some of the 100s of clubs and organizations on campus. Get involved in IM sports. Make a community through something. Explore Ann Arbor! It is a great walking/running city. You can go to Main Street, Kerrytown, State or South U, or the Arb. Always something to do! When you're 21 the bars! There are many museums and art fairs too!",
            "Don't fall under and gain the freshman 15! They do, however, have a lot of variety and healthy options if you choose to take a healthy path and not cave and eat all junk.",
            "It is a great way to begin your freshman year at a new place. Each dorm is unique and has its own special and 'quirky' qualities. It's the little box that becomes your new home.",
            "Michigan will definitely challenge you but it shapes you into the leaders and best! I value my education so much!",
            "Explore any subject you have interest in! Do not be afraid to switch career plans. Take advantage of everything and everyone on campus, it is all there to help you1",
            "Could not imagine myself at another school. You meet a world of different people, literally. You receive such a unique education at one of the most amazing university."

It has given me the opportunity to meet new people and has aspired me to do new things. I look forward to graduating in 2015 and continuing into graduate school at University of Michigan- Ann Arbor so I rate U of M- Ann Arbor a 10 out of 10., 823031=U of M looks for the ideal well-balanced individual. Make sure that you balance a high GPA with decent extracurricular activities and a high SAT/ACT score. For those that want actual numbers: based on the students I have met here, most tend to come in with around a 3.8 or higher GPA and a fairly decent SAT score of 2000., 888428=Check out Restaurant Week. Twice a year (one week in January, and one week in June), select restaurants have a fixed menu for a fixed price (usually both lunch and dinner). It's a great way to experience expensive restaurants for a fraction of the price you would otherwise pay. Also, in January there's a concert at Hill Auditorium called the Collage Concert. Students from the School of Music, Theatre and Dance put on an incredibly diverse and fun concert. It's fun to see what your fellow wolverines on North Campus are doing all year! Go to the Arb, too. While most of Ann Arbor is more industrialized, the Arb is a great getaway for some time in nature., 625593=Over a 1000 different clubs., 348117=Nichols Arboretum (The Arb) is a popular place to go for a run or to hang out and clear your head. The Safe Sex Store on South University is a classic store. Ann Arbor is well-known for Zingerman's deli, which has excellent sandwiches and other delightful treats. Legend has it that if you kiss someone under the arch between east hall and west hall by south university and the diag at midnight, you will marry them. Also, we have a hash bash in April that is one of the biggest. Not endorsing that, just saying, it's there and it's unusual., 825668=There are over 1200 clubs on campus, so you can definitely find something that interests you., 838537=Check out Festifall and Winterfest to learn about some of our 2300 student clubs. There's something for everyone! From the many premed clubs to the community service clubs to the squirrel feeding club, you're sure to fit in somewhere., 608871=The campus is right in the city of Ann Arbor and is open to the public. Therefore, anybody can just walk on campus. There were several crime alerts throughout the 2011-2012 school year, but there was nothing really serious or violent. There are also many safety officials on campus., 181321=One very important aspect that I foolishly overlooked when applying to college was their academic schedule. Every university has a difficult schedule and some are more desirable than others. Michigan'\u00c2?s is a bit strange in that its summers are exceptionally long. School begins in early September and exams tend to be over around May 1st. The generous 4 month long summer happens because our Winter Break is far shorter than those elsewhere. Since I am an out-of-state student, I found flying home for such a brief time to be fairly annoying. If you can'\u00c3?\u00c2?t decide between schools, consider which summer and winter break trade-off would best suit your plans. For in-state students, who comprise roughly 2/3 of the student body, a good tip is to try and forge your own path away from your high school classmates. I know many in-state students who hung out with high school friends instead of meeting new hall-mates and classmates at the beginning of Freshman Year and later regretted this thoroughly. Make sure to come to Orientation and the beginning of Freshman Year ready to make new friends and connections. My roommate of three years was actually the 2nd person I met at Michigan. Michigan's weather is something that should not be taken lightly. I always thought I wanted a cold, northern university but I soon grew tired of how cold it gets in Michigan. Coming from Maryland, I was neither physically nor mentally prepared for the 5 months of frigid, snowy weather that Ann Arbor gets every year. While this does not make me regret coming to school at Michigan, it does make me regret not having a heavy winter coat and boots during my Freshman Year., 311266=Apply early. The longer you wait, the more competitive the admissions process becomes. If you're applying to the LSA Honors Program, try to write a good essay, but if it's late April and you still haven't submitted your application, just get something in before they fill up., 918551=University of Michigan is a huge campus and a lot of things are going on all the time in every department. I'm going to be joining the music department and this department alone houses at least 1000 students and recitals occur every day as well as rehearsals and concerts. Like in music, UMich is extremely strong in many areas and those students who want a greater challenge can even apply to be in special colleges for those who desire to get more out of their education., 106843=Be sure to apply early, as the increasing number of applicants put those who apply after the Early Action deadline at a disadvantage. Since Early Action is non-binding, it's also helpful so that you find out earlier and can begin planning, especially since this year many applicants didn't hear back until the end of April, 393787=over 1300 student groups. enough said. there is always something to do here. oh, and yeah we have a squirrel club with like 900 members that feed squirrels every sunday with peanuts., 750942=Apply for the November 1st Early Action Deadline. TOUR., 1105043=Superb dining experience in the newly renovated halls, though a few of the older ones are left in the dust and serve lackluster food. Stick to the more popular, new dining halls and find one that you like and eat there often. It can be very difficult to maintain a healthy diet given the amount of unhealthy options, desserts, and oil/fat included in most foods but it is possible. If you're trying to avoid the freshman 15, you have to be one of the rare ones who keeps the priority of health all year! For 2015, the West Quad dining hall is the one being renovated and will be newly opened, so try there if looking for a first option.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The classes here are pretty intense. I'm a student in the college of Engineering, where group work is an important part of most classes. Most of the core classes like calculus, physics, and chemistry are very large classes, but they all have smaller recitation sections. Other classes, like language classes, are very small and interactive. Also, the size of the university makes it so that there are classes offered that professors have a personal interest in. Last year I took an art class through the German department; I learned how to weld, carve stone, and work with metal and wood in German. I've also had the chance to take a German soccer class and a German for Engineers class, and to major in Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Science because the university has the resources to offer these programs. As I get into higher level courses, the level of learning has definitely increased.
