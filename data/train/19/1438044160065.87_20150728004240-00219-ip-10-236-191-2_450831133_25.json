    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{1=The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (\"Medicare Part D\") and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The benefits provided under the Reserve Banks' plan to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. The estimated effects of the subsidy, retroactive to January 1, 2004, are reflected in actuarial loss in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit expense.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{126633=Net periodic benefit expenses are actuarially determined using a January 1 measurement date. The weighted-average assumptions used in developing net periodic benefit expenses for the System Plan for the years at January 1 were as follows:, 177290=The Reserve Banks anticipate substantially completing their announced plans in 2008., 66100=The Board of Governors requires the Reserve Banks to maintain a surplus equal to the amount of capital paid-in as of December 31 of each year. This amount is intended to provide additional capital and reduce the possibility that the Reserve Banks would be required to call on member banks for additional capital., 64211=At December\u00a031, 2006, all Federal Reserve notes were fully collateralized. All gold certificates, all special drawing right certificates, and $769,782\u00a0million of domestic securities and securities purchased under agreements to resell were pledged as collateral. At December\u00a031, 2006, no loans or investments denominated in foreign currencies were pledged as collateral., 155498=The following is a summary of the components of net periodic postretirement benefit expense for the years ended December 31 (in millions):, 55715=Activity related to U.S. government securities, including the premiums, discounts, and realized and unrealized gains and losses, is allocated to each of the Reserve Banks on a percentage basis derived from an annual settlement of interdistrict clearings that occurs in April of each year. The settlement equalizes Reserve Bank gold certificate holdings to Federal Reserve notes outstanding in each District. Activity related to investments denominated in foreign currencies is allocated to each Reserve Bank based on the ratio of each Reserve Bank's capital and surplus to aggregate capital and surplus at the preceding December 31., 140730=Employees of the Reserve Banks may also participate in the defined contribution Thrift Plan for Employees of the Federal Reserve System (\"Thrift Plan\"). The Reserve Banks' Thrift Plan contributions totaled $66\u00a0million and $63\u00a0million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are reported as a component of \"Salaries and other benefits\" in the Statements of Income. The Reserve Banks match employee contributions based on a specified formula. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, the Reserve Banks matched 80\u00a0percent on the first 6\u00a0percent of employee contributions for employees with less than five years of service and 100\u00a0percent on the first 6\u00a0percent of employee contributions for employees with five or more years of service., 2736=We have audited the accompanying combined statements of condition of the Federal Reserve Banks (the \"Reserve Banks\") as of December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, and the related combined statements of income and changes in capital for the years then ended, which have been prepared in conformity with the accounting principles, policies, and practices established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. These combined financial statements are the responsibility of the Reserve Banks' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audits., 104868=Certain of the Reserve Banks lease space to outside tenants with remaining lease terms ranging from one to fourteen years. Rental income from such leases was $25\u00a0million and $23\u00a0million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is reported as a component of \"Other income.\" Future minimum lease payments that the Bank will receive under noncancelable lease agreements in existence at December\u00a031, 2006, are as follows (in millions):, 108202=At December\u00a031, 2006, the Reserve Banks were obligated under noncancelable leases for premises and equipment with remaining terms ranging from one to approximately seventeen years. These leases provide for increased rental payments based upon increases in real estate taxes, operating costs, or selected price indices., 41422=The twelve Federal Reserve Banks (\"Reserve Banks\") are part of the Federal Reserve System (\"System\") created by Congress under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (\"Federal Reserve Act\"), which established the central bank of the United States. The Reserve Banks are chartered by the federal government and possess a unique set of governmental, corporate, and central bank characteristics., 82585=The maturity distribution of U.S. government securities bought outright, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, that were held in the SOMA at December 31, 2006, was as follows (in millions):, 69185=The Reserve Banks are exempt from federal, state, and local taxes, except for taxes on real property and sales taxes on certain construction projects. Real property taxes were $33\u00a0million and $32\u00a0million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are reported as a component of \"Occupancy expense.\", 69595=In 2003, the Reserve Banks began the restructuring of several operations, primarily check, cash, and U.S. Treasury services. The restructuring included streamlining the management and support structures, reducing staff, decreasing the number of processing locations, and increasing processing capacity in some locations. These restructuring activities continued in 2004 through 2006., 97150=At December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, the warehousing facility was $5,000\u00a0million, with no balance outstanding., 4653=In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of the Reserve Banks as of December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, and the combined results of their operations for the years then ended, on the basis of accounting described in Note 3., 102797=Bank premises and equipment at December 31 include the following amounts for leases that have been capitalized (in millions):, 87387=At December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, the total contract amount of securities sold under agreements to repurchase was $29,615\u00a0million and $30,505\u00a0million, respectively. At December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, securities sold under agreements to repurchase with a par value of $29,676\u00a0million and $30,559\u00a0million, respectively, were outstanding. The contract amount for securities sold under agreements to repurchase approximates fair value., 92758=The maturity distribution of investments denominated in foreign currencies at December\u00a031, 2006, was as follows (in millions):, 52806=SDR certificates are issued by the International Monetary Fund (\"Fund\") to its members in proportion to each member's quota in the Fund at the time of issuance. SDR certificates serve as a supplement to international monetary reserves and may be transferred from one national monetary authority to another. Under the law providing for United States participation in the SDR system, the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury is authorized to issue SDR certificates, somewhat like gold certificates, to the Reserve Banks. When SDR certificates are issued to the Reserve Banks, equivalent amounts in dollars are credited to the account established for the U.S. Treasury, and the Reserve Banks' SDR certificate accounts are increased. The Reserve Banks are required to purchase SDR certificates, at the direction of the U.S. Treasury, for the purpose of financing SDR acquisitions or for financing exchange stabilization operations. At the time SDR transactions occur, the Board of Governors allocates SDR certificate transactions among Reserve Banks based upon each Reserve Bank's Federal Reserve notes outstanding at the end of the preceding year. There were no SDR transactions in 2006 or 2005., 2217=The combined financial statements of the Federal Reserve Banks were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent auditors, for the years ended December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005., 81828=At December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of the U.S. government securities held in the SOMA, excluding accrued interest, was $795,900\u00a0million and $767,472\u00a0million, respectively, as determined by reference to quoted prices for identical securities., 107554=Several of the Reserve Banks have impaired assets as a result of the System's restructuring plan, as discussed in Note 11. Impaired assets include software, buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, and equipment. Asset impairment losses related to the check and cash restructurings of $15\u00a0million and $50\u00a0million for the periods ending December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were determined using fair values based on quoted market values or other valuation techniques and are reported as a component of \"Other expenses.\", 128823=The components of net periodic pension benefit expense (credit) for the System Plan for the years ended December 31 are shown below (in millions):, 107074=The Reserve Banks have capitalized software assets, net of amortization, of $155\u00a0million and $162\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amortization expense was $66\u00a0million and $55\u00a0million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capitalized software assets are reported as a component of \"Other assets\" and the related amortization is reported as a component of \"Other expenses.\", 161437=The Reserve Banks account for the Medicare subsidies as a reduction to benefits payments. The Reserve Banks expect to receive approximately $4\u00a0million in subsidies in the year ending December\u00a031, 2007 that relate to benefit payments made in the year ended December\u00a031, 2006., 140261=Contributions to the System Plan may be determined using different assumptions than those required for financial reporting. The System does not expect to make a cash contribution to the System Plan during 2007., 164897=The Reserve Banks offer benefits to former or inactive employees. Postemployment benefit costs are actuarially determined using a December\u00a031, 2006 measurement date and include the cost of medical and dental insurance, survivor income, and disability benefits. The accrued postemployment benefit costs recognized by the Reserve Banks at December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005 were $126\u00a0million and $124\u00a0million, respectively. This cost is included as a component of \"Accrued benefit costs\" in the Statements of Condition. Net periodic postemployment benefit expense included in 2006 and 2005 operating expenses was $20\u00a0million and $14\u00a0million, respectively, and is recorded as a component of \"Salaries and other benefits\" in the Statements of Income., 97045=At December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, there were no material open foreign exchange contracts., 175943=Employee separation costs are primarily severance costs related to identified staff reductions of approximately 1,949, including 286 and 292 staff reductions related to restructuring announced in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Costs related to staff reductions for the years ended December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005 are reported as a component of \"Salaries and other benefits\" in the Statements of Income. Contract termination costs include the charges resulting from terminating existing lease and other contracts and are shown as a component of \"Other expenses.\" Other costs include the continuation of a noncancelable lease agreement and associated facility maintenance and are shown as a component of \"Occupancy expenses.\", 87206=At December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, U.S. government securities with par values of $6,855\u00a0million and $3,776\u00a0million, respectively, were loaned from the SOMA., 108538=Rental expense under operating leases for certain operating facilities, warehouses, and data processing and office equipment (including taxes, insurance and maintenance when included in rent), net of sublease rentals, was $31\u00a0million and $26\u00a0million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Certain of the Reserve Banks' leases have options to renew., 92028=At December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of the total System investments denominated in foreign currencies, including accrued interest, was $20,434\u00a0million and $18,965\u00a0million, respectively. The fair value of government debt instruments was determined by reference to quoted prices for identical securities. The cost basis of foreign currency deposits and securities purchased under agreements to resell, adjusted for accrued interest, approximates fair value. Similar to the U.S. government securities discussed in Note 4, unrealized gains or losses have no effect on the ability of a Reserve Bank, as a central bank, to meet its financial obligations and responsibilities., 152420=For measurement purposes, the assumed health care cost trend rates at December 31 are as follows:, 102177=The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (FRBKC) is constructing a new building to replace its head office. Approximately $29\u00a0million of costs associated with the acquisition of land and site preparation for the new building are included in the \"Land\" account, and approximately $114\u00a0million of costs associated with the construction of the new building are included in the \"Construction in progress\" account. In July 2005, the FRBKC completed the sale and leaseback of its head office, and will lease the space from the purchaser until the new building is completed in 2008., 125074=The accumulated benefit obligation for the System Plan, which differs from the estimated actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation because it is based on current rather than future compensation levels, was $4,522\u00a0million and $4,162\u00a0million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively., 70821=The Reserve Banks initially applied the provisions of FASB Statement No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, at December\u00a031, 2006. This accounting standard requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the Statements of Condition, and recognition of changes in the funded status in the years in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. The transition rules for implementing the standard require applying the provisions as of the end of the year of initial implementation with no retrospective application. The incremental effects on the line items in the Statement of Condition at December\u00a031, 2006, were as follows (in millions):, 68035=Due to the substantial increase in capital paid-in at one Reserve Bank, surplus was not equated to capital at December\u00a031, 2005. The amount of additional surplus required due to these events exceeded the Bank's earnings in 2005., 145812=At December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, the weighted-average discount rate assumptions used in developing the postretirement benefit obligation were 5.75\u00a0percent and 5.50\u00a0percent, respectively., 169403=In 2003, several Reserve Banks announced plans for restructuring to streamline operations and reduce costs, including consolidation of check operations and staff reductions in various functions of the Bank. In 2004 through 2006, additional consolidation and restructuring initiatives were announced in the check, cash, purchasing, and Treasury operations. These actions resulted in the following business restructuring charges (in millions):, 111165=At December\u00a031, 2006, the Reserve Banks had other commitments and long-term obligations extending through the year 2017 with a remaining amount of $336\u00a0million. As of December\u00a031, 2006, commitments of $219\u00a0million were recognized. Purchases of $92\u00a0million and $98\u00a0million were made against these commitments during 2006 and 2005, respectively. These commitments are for goods and services to maintain currency machines, for software licenses and maintenance, for services related to check processing equipment and transportation, and have variable and/or fixed components. The variable portion of the commitments is for additional services above fixed contractual service limits. The fixed payments for the next five years under these commitments are as follows (in millions):, 5128=March\u00a030, 2007 Washington, D.C., 160256=The 2005 service cost contains an adjustment by one Reserve Bank that resulted from a review of plan terms and assumptions. A plan amendment that modified the credited service period eligibility requirements created curtailment gains in 2005. A deferred curtailment gain, which was recorded in 2006 as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, is expected to be recognized in net income in 2008 when the related employees terminate employment., 140484=The Reserve Banks' projected benefit obligation, funded status, and net pension expenses for the BEP and the SERP at December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, and for the years then ended, are not material., 125455=The weighted-average assumptions used in developing the projected pension benefit obligation for the System Plan as of December 31 were as follows:, 159788=Net postretirement benefit expense is actuarially determined using a January 1 measurement date. At January\u00a01, 2006 and 2005, the weighted-average discount rate assumptions used to determine net periodic postretirement benefit expense were 5.50\u00a0percent and 5.75\u00a0percent, respectively., 60061=FX swap arrangements and warehousing agreements are revalued daily at current market exchange rates. Activity related to these agreements, with the exception of the unrealized gains and losses resulting from the daily revaluation, is allocated to each Reserve Bank based on the ratio of each Reserve Bank's capital and surplus to aggregate capital and surplus at the preceding December 31. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from the daily revaluation are allocated to the FRBNY and not allocated to the other Reserve Banks., 63893=\"Federal Reserve notes outstanding, net\" in the Statements of Condition represents Federal Reserve notes outstanding, reduced by the currency issued to the Reserve Banks but not in circulation, of $175,661\u00a0million and $148,152\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2006 and 2005, respectively., 67836=In the event of a decrease in capital paid-in, the excess surplus, after equating capital paid-in and surplus at December 31, is distributed to the U.S. Treasury in the following year., 108967=Future minimum rental payments under noncancelable operating leases, net of sublease rentals, with remaining terms of one year or more, at December\u00a031, 2006 are as follows (in millions):, 47237=During 2005, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (\"FRBA\") was assigned the overall responsibility for managing the Reserve Banks' provision of check services to depository institutions and, as a result, recognizes total System check revenue on its Statements of Income. Because the other eleven Reserve Banks incur costs to provide check services, a policy was adopted by the Reserve Banks in 2005 that required that the FRBA compensate the other Reserve Banks for costs incurred to provide check services. In 2006 this policy was extended to the ACH services, which are managed by the FRBA, as well as to Fedwire funds transfer and securities transfer services, which are managed by the FRBNY. The FRBA and the FRBNY compensate the other Reserve Banks for the costs incurred to provide these services., 153979=Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects for the year ended December\u00a031, 2006 (in millions):, 175726=Adjustments to the accrued liability due to changes in the estimated restructuring costs were offset against total charges. Without these offsets, total charges would have been $10\u00a0million in 2006., 68663=The Board of Governors assesses the Reserve Banks to fund its operations based on each Reserve Bank's capital and surplus balances as of December 31 of the previous year. The Board of Governors also assesses each Reserve Bank for the expenses incurred for the U.S. Treasury to issue and retire Federal Reserve notes based on each Reserve Bank's share of the number of notes comprising the System's net liability for Federal Reserve notes on December 31 of the previous year., 97366=A summary of bank premises and equipment at December 31 is as follows (in millions):}",
