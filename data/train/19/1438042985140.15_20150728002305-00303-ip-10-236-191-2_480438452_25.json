We plan to outsource independent consultant engineers\u00a0and geologists on a\u00a0part time\u00a0basis to conduct the work programs on our mineral properties in order to carry out our plan of operations.

To date we have had negative cash flows from operations and we have been dependent on sales of our equity securities and debt financing to meet our cash requirements and have incurred net losses from inception to July 31, 2012 of $1,419,218. Our net cash used in operations for the year ended July 31, 2012 was $408,872. As of July 31, 2012 and we had working capital deficit of $95,968. We do not expect positive cash flow from operations in the near term. There is no assurance that actual cash requirements will not exceed our estimates. In particular, additional capital may be required in the event that drilling and completion costs increase beyond our expectations; or we encounter greater costs associated with general and administrative expenses or offering costs. The occurrence of any of the aforementioned events could adversely affect our ability to meet our business plans. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to successfully execute our business plan. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

On June 1, 2012 the directors thought it to be in the best interest of our company to enter into an Amended Consulting Agreement with Ian Spowart to decrease the consulting fee to $3,500 from June 1, 2012., 602556=June 1, 2012., 413253=Stock Issued for cash on August 27, 2010, 651284=Our board of directors has determined that none of the members of our audit committee qualifies as an \"audit committee financial expert\" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and is \"independent\" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended., 665326=Our company has entered into Consulting Agreements with Daniel Martinez-Atkinson and Ian Spowart on an ongoing basis, dated the 12th day of February, 2010, and effective as of February 1, 2010, whereby our company has agreed to retain Daniel Martinez-Atkinson to the position of Chief Financial Officer and Ian Spowart to the position of Chief Executive Officer of our company. The agreements may be terminated with 30 days notice. As compensation, the agreements provide for monthly payments of US$5,000 to Daniel Martinez-Atkinson and US$6,500 to Ian Spowart.

The original value assigned these shares and the leaseholds was $3.3 million. It was determined that due to the relationship between Langold and Asia-Pacific this transaction was not arms length but rather was related party. The Company corrected the error and the shares issued and the leasehold costs recorded were valued at the price paid by Langold on their original 3 year lease acquisition from the land owners. That price paid was $20,000 cash plus 1,800,000 shares of restricted Liberty Energy stock which was valued at $243,932 for a total consideration of $263,932.Based on the above we are restating our April 30, 2012 financial statements file on form 10-Q to correct this error on the April 30, 2012 balance sheet., 398105=Net Loss, July 31, 2009, 632778=Ian Spowart has been President, CEO and Director of our company since September 8, 2009., 387923=Stock Issued for cash on December 4, 2006, 240001=July 31, 2012 \u00a0and 2011, 3714=Transition report pursuant Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 600599=On October 27, 2011, Management agreed to forgive debt outstanding to Ian A.

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. In addition, our accounting policies are described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2012., 667288=There were no unexercised options, stock that has not vested or equity incentive plan awards for our named executive officers as at July 31, 2012., 395383=Balance, July 31, 2008, 703638=Certification of Principal Executive Officer filed pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 697154=Assignment and Bill of Sale with Trius Operations LLC dated March 30, 2010.

If we issue any such additional shares, such issuances also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other shareholders. Further, any such issuance may result in a change in our control. \u00a0, 704149=Certification of Principal Financial Officer filed pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 163712=Transatlatic Petroleum have confirmed that petrophysical analysis of the Etropole formation indicates net pay of 114 meters, with an average porosity of 6% and water saturation of 48%.
