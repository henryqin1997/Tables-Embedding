            "I got a very safe vibe from the campus. I saw several campus police scattered about while I was there, and when I walked around on my own and eventually got lost, several people stopped to help me get where I needed to be.",
            "There's a gazebo they told us about that is right next to a small stream. Apparently, if you kiss someone under the gazebo, you have to get married (and quite a few have in the chapel on campus). If you get kissed and you don't want to get married, you have to push the person in the water and run around the gazebo three (or maybe more, I can't remember) times.",
            "It's a great learning space, and I believe they said no classes were taught by graduate students. The campus is beautiful with a great location, so I believe it's all worth it.",
            "You're in the middle of Richmond. Trust me, you'll find something.",
            "Their options seemed pretty nice while I was there, although I can only remember one or two dining halls.",
            "The dorm room I was shown was really spacey (the biggest I've seen on any campus) and they help you find the perfect room.",
            "This school from my understanding is supposed to be great academically. It's an honor if you were to be accepted.",
            "The campus is absolutely beautiful and the atmosphere is friendly. You're separated from the city but you can be in the heart of it in less than ten minutes. I really liked it, so it's one of my top choices."

UR is very accomodating to vegans and vegetarians, and I think the gluten-free population has an easy time eating in D Hall. I think the vegan and vegetarian station in D Hall is generally higher quality than some of the other stations. Tyler's and the Passport Cafe are great places to go if you need something quick and to-go. The Passport Cafe always has cool international-type cuisine, and the ambience is nice and relaxed. 8:15 is UR's on-campus Starbucks, and I don't know of anyone who doesn't go there. It's a great place to stop by on your way to class, because the library is basically in the middle of campus. They always have pastries and unique, hard to find Clif bars, too.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Campus Safety The campus has its own University Police officers who are very responsive to all calls made. There are also on-campus emergency telephones illuminated with blue lights that are linked directly to the police station if you pick up. Greek Life A large percentage of the student population decides to take part in Greek life. A large portion of social activities and parties are run by fraternities. However, you do not need to be in a Greek organization to participate and there are other social events unrelated to Greek organizations that even members of Greek organizations take part in. Clubs and Activities Richmond is very open-minded about clubs and encourages students to be creative in starting them. There are a huge amount of clubs and activities, and many students will often overlap and be a part of several different clubs Bang for the buck Richmond is very expensive. But you definitely get your money's worth when you come. Students have so many resources that are free because tuition is so expensive. Absolutely worth it, but you have to make sure to find and use the resources What to do for fun A lot",
