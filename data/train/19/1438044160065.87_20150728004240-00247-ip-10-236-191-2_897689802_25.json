            "USU is great for those who want to get away from home, but not too far. It is also great for those who want many social opportunities, and awesome academic opportunity. USU has a wide variety of very good academic programs, such as the Huntsman School of Business, which is a well-known and prestigious school in the Business world.",
            "Live on-campus your first year, and room with a few people you don't know. It's a great way to make friends. I live currently live on-campus, and everyone in my building leaves their doors open when they are home, so you can just walk in and say hello, and very often, people hang out in the lounge or in the halls.",
            "USU is very good about giving out scholarships and financial aid, and definitely has comparatively good tuition prices. Everything you pay in tuition and student fees comes back to you in the form of classes and school-provided services, such as a free Health Center (doctor's office), many gyms, and free bicycle rental.",
            "There are always things going on around the USU campus. There are tons of clubs to join, and lots of fun things to do (such as a Humans vs. Zombies nerf war every semester!) You'll never be bored, and make lots of friends.",
            "When you take a class at USU, you learn what you expected to learn from the class, and more. There are also many helpful services available, such as tutoring programs, group study rooms, computer labs, etc."

The average student spends about 8-12 grand a year for both semester on living here and that's if money is no option. That is about an average of 2000 on tuition each semester, 1600 on housing, 1000 on food, and about 500 for books and what not. The travel here by the way is completely free. All bus systems for city and campus are free for all to ride. Believe me this is really worth your money, 181862=Apply now! If you apply before the December 1st deadline, you automatically receive academic scholarships if you're eligible. I currently have half tuition because I applied early. Also, live on campus for at least your first year. There's a lot that you can get involved in with Housing and Residence Life, AND you're close to your classes. I could wake up five minutes before class any day of the week and still get to class on time - it's reassuring. Get involved and go to events, because they happen alllll the time and they're an absolute blast! Also, pay attention when anybody or anything says the words free Aggie Ice Cream, because they are said often, and they are beautiful. Aggie Ice Cream is like food for your soul. 26 flavors of goodness., 1118057=You can go hiking, ice skating indoors or outdoors in the winter, skiing (there is a fantastic ski resort in Logan Canyon about 45 minutes from campus), showshoeing, sledding, go to a show at the Ellen Eccles Theater, thrift shop, volunteer at numerous charitable organizations, attend free events and activities at the Logan Tabernacle (a community church/fine arts events center), shop at local businesses including antique book stores, organic markets, global trade gift shops, fashion boutiques, etc., you can take community classes, visit the local gardener's market from April to October, go yard-saleing, attend local religious services and events, get involved with the Deaf community, volunteer with our chapter of Special Olympics, spend time with the elderly, party at the White Owl (the only bar here that I know of), etc., 38363=Utah State University touts a friendly atmosphere, intimate campus, world-class research faculty and ready opportunities to work with them, and accessible professors. While the professors are readily available and glad to explain difficult courses during office hours, my professors explain concepts very poorly in class. Instruction seems to emphasize superficial examples and applications, and the deeper theory is rarely taught. My electrical engineering and statics lectures are 100% example, 0% theory, and the required textbooks only superficially explain things. The science professors are much better at explaining theory, but still emphasize sample problems instead of symbolic exploration. However, learning opportunities outside of class are much better. Though only a freshman, I\u2019ve been able to work with the university\u2019s Microgravity Research Team from day one, so I\u2019ve picked up a little heat transfer theory and have written ten pages of the team\u2019s proposal for a 2011 experiment. Almost any faculty member will set you up in a research project if you ask them, or at least tell you what to study so that you can contribute as soon as possible. They are happy to accept volunteer lab workers. The USU library is an excellent learning environment. It has quiet zones, group study rooms, several large open computer labs and conversational study areas, and an excellent collection. Besides, it boasts a flood of natural light in the daytime, so you don\u2019t feel locked up and confined inside. Overall, I\u2019d say USU is a pretty average learning environment. The facilities are good and the opportunities to learn outside of class are great, but these strengths are balanced by its remarkably poor lecturers., 917991=To become an Ultimate Aggie, one must run across the entire campus from the time first snow falls in November to February. The participant has to do so naked, evade campus police, and ride the huge metal bull statue. Oh yeah, and you have to be photographed for proof., 874751=They have movies held at the main building for student all through out the year which is nice because it gets cold in Logan. Sledding is an option through out the whole year. Utah State has The Howl every October and is way fun. Also the End of the Year Bash where they have bands and artist come perform. Can't forget about the football and basketball games that are a blast., 235153=the greek community has been steadily growing for the passed couple of years. fall of 2012 will welcome another fraternity and hopefully another sorority.}",

Although it is big here, you always feel like you are important and a part of the school. Tips for prospective students I live in some apartments down the street from the University campus and across the street from the Spectrum and the Stadium. It is the perfect location because you are still close to the school, and also all of the sporting events are right across the street. Bang for the buck I am getting every dollars worth that I have spent in going to Utah State. Am enjoying being here",
