            "I attend the Rosen College of Hospitality Management, which is off-campus. I like attending Rosen because you can take classes at main campus and participate in the big school atmosphere, or you can stay on Rosen campus and take part in a smaller, more intimate and focused atmosphere. I would say that it is great for students who actually take an active role in learning, but who also have a great sense of adventure.",
            "Orlando is an exciting place - make sure you get comfortable with your classes before you indulge in the glamour. I recommend getting into a good study schedule then adding in the fun. Also, be sure to get a really good bike lock.",
            "Classes are expensive, but I have found that if I attend all of my classes all of the time I get my money's worth. Skipping class regularly will not teach you anything, and it will waste your money. One thing I dislike is the extra expenses in some of the classes for things like the iClicker, Wall Street Journal subscription, computer programs, etc.",
            "I have genuinely enjoyed my classes. I have not made a lot of connections with other students, but that is starting to change.",
            "The professors I have had are VERY interested in helping their students succeed. They have all had extensive experience in their fields and use this experience to illustrate topics discussed in the classroom. They understand that the students have busy lives and reflect this on their syllabus. Few professors have assigned a lot of 'busy work', I have had relevant homework and assignments. I am impressed with how well they relate what they are teaching to the lives of the students."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{31485=With costs rising and funding dropping, UCF is starting to have trouble with the amount of aid it used to give. Still, the college is dedicated to finding solutions to the difficult financial times without putting too much burden on the students. Bright Futures is a huge help for in-state students, but most students with whom I have spoken on the subject also received varying degrees of financial aid, from partial tuition to full tuition AND room-and-board. As a hint, though, they LOVE national merit semi-finalists, finalists, and scholars. One semi-finalist I knew received around $8000 per year on TOP of a full tuition scholarship from the college AND full bright futures from the state! She is EARNING money by attending, as the extra defaults to her account. She can use it for books, school supplies, and sometimes just living expenses, which is fantastic. They also offer many kinds of grants and loans for financial need, even if your GPA has taken a hit from your financial situation. My neighbor has received several subsidized loans from the government and the school and is managing to keep his out-of-pocket expenses down to between $800 and $1500 per year even though he didn't qualify for too much merit-based scholarship money. There is a great opportunity for students here to save money and still get a great education from knowledgeable and enthusiastic professors and assistants., 345624=Scholarships, average 1227 SA.T. score, average 27 A.C.T score. average High school GPA 3.8, 797814=Lake Claire allows students to rent paddle boats/kayaks/canoes for free; it's located on campus at the end of Greek Park Drive. I go there on weekends sometimes. Every year in April UCF students are given 1 free ticket to Universal's Islands of Adventure. Athletic events are free, except for football games., 114166=Moderately active. Many different Greek organizations to choose from, if that's your thing. 100% no hazing policy and few legitimately concerning stories (that is, stories beyond that of a pillow fight gotten rough, harmless pranks, or of sending the pledge to buy 1000 condoms) ever really heard., 62538=Program SEPS (safety escort and patrol services) number into your phone if you have classes that let out after 7:00. They are wonderful people, and I'm really glad that I used their services. Carry a jacket with you. It might be hot outside, but the classrooms are generally way too cold. Watch out for longboarders. Not all of them know what they are doing. Avoid campus on game days, if at all possible. It's absolutely insane., 856021=nearly 1000 people run into a knee deep water fountain every year,, 19080=The University of Central Florida is a very large school. With over 50,000 students attending classes at the main campus or one of their satellite campuses, and almost 1500 acres of land on the main campus alone, it is safe to say that UCF is one of the larger universities in the nation. That being said, in most of your classes you will be one of the three or four hundred students sitting in your classroom. The easiest way for you to make the most of your learning experience at UCF is to always sit in the front five or six rows of the class and GET TO KNOW YOUR PROFFESSORS. Remember that you will probably only represent .003% of the student body sitting in that auditorium sized classroom. The teachers, for the most part, are very willing to help and they are very good at what they do. However, if you don\u2019t ask for help and get to know your professors you will soon find yourself barely scraping by and doing poorly in the majority of your classes. Other great resources to help you learn more is to take advantage of the free tutoring, especially those offered by SARC (Student Academic Resource Center). If you follow this advice you will do wonderfully in all your classes and will definitely learn a lot., 983115=I can't say much, here, other than I've never felt unsafe while on campus. There have been a few crime reports, but mostly off campus, in the apartments, when someone got robbed. UCF does a good job of alerting students when a crime occurs and giving safety tips. Also, starting Fall 2012, UCF will be a smoke-free campus., 1111995=On the Friday of homecoming week we have spirit splash. It was name best campus tradition in 2011. They have a Live DJ, special guest, and free stuff while students are allowed to go into the fountain located in front of the library. It is a crazy wet day., 987116=I was an English- Creative Writing major in the honors program, and most semesters were tough. During my first semester as a junior, I had an average of 300 pages to read a week! Of course, 1000 and 2000 level courses aren't as rigorous., 851587=UCF has a beautiful campus and most of the buildings are new. The gym is enormous and has a Subway restaurant inside, as well as an indoor track, basketball courts, an abundance of workout equipment, and several televisions to keep you entertained while you're sculpting yourself into shape. The dorm rooms for freshmen on campus are generally of good size and available for around $2000-$3000., 1048013=I can't really say anything about this one because I haven't started class at UCF yet, I start June 25th., 649548=the homecoming week. spirit spirit spirit. in 2011, for the homecoming concert, the sga booked lupe fiasco and panic at the disco. unbelievable concert.there is also something called spirit splash at ucf where everyone jumps into the reflection pond for one day. sports are a huge deal here especially football and basketball, be sure to go out to the games, lots of fun., 175600=Surprisingly, as an out-of-state student you would think that the cost would be prohibitive compared to staying in state. I was accepted at both Penn State University main campus and UCF. Penn State 2010/2011 tuition is $14,412 and UCF non-Florida resident tuition is $19,832. Penn State did not offer any scholarship tuition assistance, but UCF offered me a $30,000 Knights Achievement Award scholarship! It was an easy decision for me when you add in the Florida sunshine and the fact that major theme parks and beaches are all within an hour's drive. You are not only getting a good education for your buck, but an amazing college life to go with it., 159600=I cannot stress this enough, APPLY EARLY!!! I applied ridiculously early (October, I believe) and got my acceptance letter literally a week later. While some of my other friends waited to apply and either got wait-listed or ended up getting accepted so late that it was even too late to apply for on-campus housing, forcing her to live off-campus by herself. Another thing (for those high school juniors), start taking the ACT/SAT the beginning of your junior year. I took my 3rd ACT the beginning of summer before senior year, that way, I was able to start filling out applications right when senior year started. You'll be so glad to just get those out of the way!, 416182=Don't take online classes your first semester! And take school as seriously as you can. This is the time where everyone wants to go out and party, and that's one hundred percent OK, but don't let it interfere with attending class and getting your work done! And avoid Alafaya Trail around 5:45 pm on weekdays, the traffic is terrible! And don't try to park on Campus between 10:30 and 1:30, there are never any parking spots! Take advantage of all of the free resources available, the gym, the health center, tutors, etc!, 987547=If you want to contact UCF, I suggest using email instead of the phone whenever possible. Replies are always prompt and informative, and you don't have to go through the hassle of being redirected and put on hold. If you have to park on campus, take early classes. If you arrive by 8:30 AM, you'll pretty much have your pick of spots. Join the Burnett Honors College as an honors student, honors in the major student, or both. You'll have early access to classes, and the opportunity to take small honors classes. Watch what classes you take in the same semester. Try to balance more rigorous courses with easier ones, but watch out. Some classes that seem easy can actually be tough! Take online classes. They're amazingly flexible, and usually easier than lecture classes., 366641=I recommend living on campus. This is the best way to fully immerse yourself in UCF life. For freshmen students, the LINK program is an awesome way to meet new people and learn everything about the school. There are events every month where you earn LINK loot, redeemable at the end of semester auction for cool prizes like a $1300 scholarship and a year subscription of Netflix. I didn't take full advantage of this first semester but I certainly will in the spring., 263078=Fall 2013, the Neptune community will be built, brand new, very spacious and comfortable.}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 89 out of 102 people found this review useful. 2 of 736 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students who enjoy big campuses and classrooms with a lot of people will like it here because the class sizes are large. Also, they say there is always something to do and you will meet a lot of people. If you are shy, you wont be shy anymore probably. Tips for prospective students Don't think because you got into this school that you will survive. If you are going to this school just to make money, you will not survive. Go to college for fun but also because you want to learn. Login to rate or flag the reviews Ledesha from Orlando, FL 07/22/2009",
