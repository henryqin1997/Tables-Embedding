            "Public Security can be seen easily walking/driving around campus and checking up on situations.",
            "I am a member of Pi-Theta-Kappa.",
            "I am not associated with clubs or activities on campus, but the main student association provides food and drinks to students occasionally and they have monthly or weekly events.",
            "Great for those who want an inexpensive education in a midsized town and small class sizes. Almost all of my classes have 10 to 15 students. Very few classes have over 20 - those are classes in halls or large class rooms.",
            "I do not know of any, although, the parking lots were not designed for easy access to doors; one always has to walk a slight distance to get to a door.",
            "Classes are CHEAP. About 100$ per credit hour.",
            "Explore Belleville. Also, there is the Metro-Link train station on campus which links you to St. Louis instantly. Free train pass is included with classes.",
            "Fairly expensive on campus. There is a Starbucks and cafeteria.",
            "Liberal Arts classes are easy, while maths and especially sciences are more challenging.",
            "Be sure to apply for graduation on time, and do not wait till the last minuet for counseling for any issues at all. Double check and triple check to make sure your classes can/will transfer as you want them to.",
            "The classes are fairly easy and teachers are understanding of student needs. The facilities are very nice; they have a brand new edition to their Liberal Arts building which is impressive."
