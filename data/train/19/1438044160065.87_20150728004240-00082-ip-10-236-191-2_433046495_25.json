    "textBeforeTable": "The second week of \u201csummer\u201d saw a distinct belly flop for Poseidon. Launching against Mission: Impossible III, the disaster movie nearly lived up to its name, grabbing just $20.4 million in its opening weekend. But Tom Cruise and co will be happier \u2013 M:I:III won the US box office for a second week running, with a $24.5 million weekend. For those of you counting, that\u2019s a drop of just under 50%. Elsewhere, it was a terrible week for new releases. Lindsay Lohan will be hoping that Prairie Home Companion brings home the kudos, because her new teen comedy Just My Luck died on its feet. $5.5 million doesn\u2019t exactly feel very lucky. And if footie trilogy kick-off Goal! was hoping to find plenty of fans in the States, then that dream didn\u2019t so much begin as collapse, with the movie not even cracking the top 10. $2 million was just about enough for the movie to make it to 12th place. Hail to the charts! Tweet",
