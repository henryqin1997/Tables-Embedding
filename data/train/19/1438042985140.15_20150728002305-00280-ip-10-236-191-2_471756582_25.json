The polynucleotide or the vector according to the invention can also be in suspension in a buffer solution or be combined with liposomes., 153957=The vaccine compositions comprising nucleotide sequences or vectors into which are inserted said sequences are especially described in the international application No. WO 90/11092 and likewise in the international application No. WO 95/11307., 42667=On the epidemiological level, the first signs of this pathology appeared at the start of 1995 in the east of the C\ufffdtes d'Armor region in France, and the farms affected are especially confined to this area of the region. In December 1996, the number of farms concerned could not be evaluated with precision because of the absence of a specific laboratory diagnostic method or of an epidemiological surveillance system of the livestock. Based on the clinical facts as well as on results of postmortem examinations supplied by veterinarians, it is possible to estimate this number as several dozen (80-100). The contagiousness of the disease is weak to moderate. Cases are being reported outside the initial area and for the majority are following the transfer of animals coming from farms familiar with the problem. On the other hand, a characteristic of the condition is its strong remanence. Thus, farms which have been affected for a year are still affected in spite of the massive administration of therapeutics. Farms with clinical expression are drawn from various categories of specialization (breeders/fatteners, post-weaners/fatteners) and different economic structures are concerned. In addition, the disorders appear even in farms where the rules of animal husbandry are respected., 236109=The gene coding for this GM-CSF protein was cloned and sequenced by Inumaru et al. (Immunol. Cell Biol., 1995, 73 (5), 474-476). The pcDNA3-GMCSF+ plasmid was obtained by Dr. B. Charley of INRA of Jouy-en-Josas (78, France)., 131903=The polypeptides according to the invention allow monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to be prepared which are characterized in that they specifically recognize the polypeptides according to the invention. It will advantageously be possible to prepare the monoclonal antibodies from hybridomas according to the technique described by Kohler and Milstein in 1975. It will be possible to prepare the polyclonal antibodies, for example, by immunization of an animal, in particular a mouse, with a polypeptide or a DNA, according to the invention, associated with an adjuvant of the immune response, and then purification of the specific antibodies contained in the serum of the immunized animals on an affinity column on which the polypeptide which has served as an antigen has previously been immobilized. The polyclonal antibodies according to the invention can also be prepared by purification, on an affinity column on which a polypeptide according to the invention has previously been immobilized, of the antibodies contained in the serum of pigs infected by a PWD circovirus., 72264=Among said nucleotide sequences according to the invention, those corresponding to open reading frames, called ORF sequences, and coding for polypeptides, such as, for example, the sequences SEQ ID No. 9 (ORF1), SEQ ID No. 11 (ORF2) and SEQ ID No. 13 (ORF3) respectively corresponding to the nucleotide sequences between the positions 47 and 985 determined with respect to the position of the nucleotides on the sequence SEQ ID No. 1, the positions 1723 and 1022 and the positions 658 and 38 with respect to the position of the nucleotides on the sequence SEQ ID No. 5 (represented according to the orientation 3\u2032\u21925\u2032), the ends being included, or alternatively the sequences SEQ ID No. 23 (ORF\u20321), SEQ ID No. 25 (ORF\u20322) and SEQ ID No. 27 (ORF\u20323), respectively corresponding to the sequences between the positions 51 and 995 determined with respect to the position of the nucleotides on the sequence SEQ ID No. 15, the positions 1734 and 1033 and the positions 670 and 357, the positions being determined with respect to the position of the nucleotides on the sequence SEQ ID No. 19 (represented according to the orientation 3\u2032\u21925\u2032), the ends being included, are finally preferred., 117240=A more preferred host cell according to the invention is E. coli, such as deposited at the CNCM on 3 Jul. 1997, under the number I-1891., 121929=For example, recourse can be made to the technique of synthesis in homogeneous solution described by Houben-Weyl in 1974., 187601=The in-tandem constructs of the viral genome (dimers) such as the constructs used for the preparation of the pBS KS+ tandem PCV Kpn I vector, deposited at the CNCM under the number I-1891, 3 Jul. 1997 (E. coli transformed by said vector) are very interesting for their use in methods of production of sufficient quantity of an inoculum formed of DNA, intended for the virus production, this in the absence of a satisfactory virus production protocol in a cell system. These said methods of production using in-tandem constructs of the viral genome will allow the virulence factors to be studied by mutation and by way of consequence will be able to be used for the production of a collection of viruses carrying the mutations indicated in the construction of vectors which will have the appropriate tropism and virulence. These vectors with autoreplicative structure have the sought gene transfer properties, especially for their applications in gene therapy, and in vaccinology., 112399=Examples of nonradioactive labeling of nucleotide sequences are described, for example, in French Patent No. 78.10975 or by Urdea et al. or by Sanchez-Pescador et al. in 1988., 320857=The invention described herein may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The specific embodiments previously described are therefore to be considered as illustrative of, and not limiting, the scope of the invention. Additionally, the disclosure of all publications and patent applications cited above and below, including International Patent Application No. PCT/FR98/02634, filed Dec. 4, 1998, and published as International Publication No. WO 99/29871 on Jun. 17, 1999, are expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entireties to the same extent as if each were incorporated by reference individually., 124999=The procedures for synthesis of hybrid molecules encompass the methods used in genetic engineering for constructing hybrid nucleotide sequences coding for the polypeptide sequences sought. It will be possible, for example, to refer advantageously to the technique for obtainment of genes coding for fusion proteins described by Minton in 1984., 65638=Two amino-acids or nucleotidic sequences are said to be \u201cidentical\u201d if the sequence of amino-acids or nucleotidic residues, in the two sequences is the same when aligned for maximum correspondence as described below. Sequence comparisons between two (or more) peptides or polynucleotides are typically performed by comparing sequences of two optimally aligned sequences over a segment or \u201ccomparison window\u201d to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Ad. App. Math 2: 482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Neddleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 85: 2444 (1988), by computerized implementation of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by visual inspection., 39895=Piglet weight loss disease (PWD), alternatively called fatal piglet wasting (FPW) has been widely described in North America (Harding, J. C., 1997), and authors have reported the existence of a relationship between this pathology and the presence of porcine circovirus (Daft, B. et al., 1996; Clark, E. G., 1997; Harding, J. C., 1997; Harding, J. C. and Clark, E. G., 1997; Nayar, G. P. et al., 1997). A porcine circovirus has already been demonstrated in established lines of cell cultures derived from pigs and chronically infected (Tischer, I., 1986, 1988, 1995; Dulac, G. C., 1989; Edwards, S., 1994; Allan, G. M., 1995 and McNeilly, F., 1996). This virus, during experimental infection of piglets, does not prove pathogenic for pigs (Tischer, I., 1986, Horner, G. W., 1991) and its nucleotide sequence has been determined and characterized (Tischer, I., 1982; Meehan, B. M. et al., 1997; Mankertz., A., 1997). The porcine circovirus, called PCV virus, is part of the circovirus genus of the circoviridae family (Murphy, F. A. et al., 1995) whose virion has a circular DNA of size between 1.7 and 2.3 kb, which DNA comprises three open reading frames (ORF1 to ORF3), coding for a replication protein REP involved in the initiation and termination phase of rolling circular replication (RCR) (Heyraud-Nitschke, F., et al., 1995; Harding, M. R. et al., 1993; Hanson, S. F. et al., 1995; Fontes, E. P. B. et al., 1994), coding for a capsid protein (Boulton, L. H. et al., 1997; Hackland, A. F. et al., 1994; Chu, P. W. G. et al., 1993) and coding for a nonstructural protein called a dissemination protein (Lazarowitz., S. G. et al., 1989)., 160983=Among the methods of insertion of genes, such as, for example, microinjection, especially the injection of naked plasmid DNA (Derse, D. et al., 1995, and Zhao, T. M. et al., 1996), electroporation, homologous recombination, the use of viral particles, such as retroviruses, is widespread. However, applied in vivo, the gene transfer systems of recombinant retroviral type at the same time have a weak infectious power (insufficient concentration of viral particles) and a lack of specificity with regard to chosen target cells., 38274=This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/718,264, filed Nov. 21, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,179,472, issued on Feb. 20, 2007, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/514,245, filed Feb. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,023, issued on Mar. 9, 2004, which is a continuation-in-part of International Patent Application No. PCT/FR98/02634, filed Dec. 4, 1998, published in a non-English language, and now abandoned, which claims priority to French Application No. 97/15396, filed Dec. 5, 1997, the specifications of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for all purposes., 155615=Such a vaccine can likewise be prepared in the form of a composition containing a vector according to the invention, placed under the control of regulation elements allowing its expression in man or animal. It will be possible, for example, to use, by way of in vivo expression vector of the polypeptide antigen of interest, the plasmid pcDNA3 or the plasmid pcDNA1/neo, both marketed by Invitrogen (R&D Systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom). It is also possible to use the plasmid V1Jns.tPA, described by Shiver et al. in 1995. Such a vaccine will advantageously comprise, apart from the recombinant vector, a saline solution, for example a sodium chloride solution., 73476=The nucleotide sequence fragments according to the invention can be obtained, for example, by specific amplification, such as PCR, or after digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes of nucleotide sequences according to the invention, these methods in particular being described in the work of Sambrook et al., 1989. Said representative fragments can likewise be obtained by chemical synthesis when their size is not very large and according to methods well known to persons skilled in the art., 70824=The stringent hybridization conditions described above for a polynucleotide with a size of approximately 350 bases will be adapted by the person skilled in the art for oligonucleotides of greater or smaller size, according to the teaching of Sambrook et al., 1989., 161543=The production of cell-specific viral vectors, having a tissue-specific tropism, and whose gene of interest can be translated adequately by the target cells, is realizable, for example, by fusing a specific ligand of the target host cells to the N-terminal part of a surface protein of the envelope of PWD circovirus. It is possible to mention, for example, the construction of retroviral particles having the CD4 molecule on the surface of the envelope so as to target the human cells infected by the HIV virus (YOUNG, J. A. T. et al., Sciences 1990, 250, 1421-1423), viral particles having a peptide hormone fused to an envelope protein to specifically infect the cells expressing the corresponding receptor (KASAHARA, N. et al., Sciences 1994, 266, 1373-1376) or else alternatively viral particles having a fused polypeptide capable of immobilizing on the receptor of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) (COSSET, F. L. et al., J. of Virology 1995, 69, 10, 6314-6322). In another approach, single-chain fragments of antibodies directed against surface antigens of the target cells are inserted by fusion with the N-terminal part of the envelope protein (VALSESIA-WITTMAN, S. et al., J. of Virology 1996, 70, 3, 2059-2064; TEARINA CHU, T. H. et al., J. of Virology 1997, 71, 1, 720-725)., 155336=Advantageously, such a vaccine will be prepared according to the technique described by Tacson et al. or Huygen et al. in 1996 or alternatively according to the technique described by Davis et al. in the international application No. WO 95/11307.}",
