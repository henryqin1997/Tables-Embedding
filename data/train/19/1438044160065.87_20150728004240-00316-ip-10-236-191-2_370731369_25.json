In this scenario, the Key Server periodically sends a rekey to the Group Members every 2 hours (7200 seconds). In the below example, even though the Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) lifetime is set to 28800 seconds (8 hours), the rekey timer is still 2 hours.

Omit this subtask if rekey is not in use. Security threats, as well as the cryptographic technologies to help protect against them, are constantly changing. For more information about the latest Cisco cryptographic recommendations, see the Next Generation Encryption (NGE) white paper. Note Configuring RSA Keys to Sign Rekey Messages Before creating the GDOI group, you must first configure IKE and the IPsec transform set, and you must create an IPsec profile. For information about how to configure IKE and the IPsec transform set and to create an IPsec profile, see the \u201cRelated Documents\u201d subsection of the \u201cAdditional References\u201d section.

Configuring the Rekey This section includes the following optional tasks: Rekey is used in the control plane by the key server to periodically refresh the policy and IPsec SAs of the group. On the group-member side, instead of fully re-registering when timers expire for any other reasons, refreshing the registration with a rekey is more efficient. The initial registration is always a unicast registration. The key server can be configured to send rekeys in unicast or multicast mode. The rekey transport mode is determined by whether the key",
