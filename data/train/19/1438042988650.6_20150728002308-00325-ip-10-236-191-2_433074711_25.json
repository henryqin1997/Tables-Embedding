            "ORGANIC DEVICE AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING ORGANIC DEVICE - An organic device has a substrate made of polymer, and a polymer layer adhered on the substrate. A crystallization degree of an adhesive surface with the polymer layer in the substrate is smaller than a crystallization degree of an interior of the substrate. In a manufacturing method for manufacturing an organic device including a substrate made of polymer; and having a polymer layer adhered on the substrate, the manufacturing method includes performing a low crystallization process on an adhesive surface with the polymer layer in the substrate to have a crystallization degree lower than a crystallization degree of an interior of the substrate.",
            "OPTICAL WAVEGUIDE, OPTICAL TRANSMISSION MODULE, ELECTRONIC DEVICE AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING OPTICAL WAVEGUIDE - A light guide includes a core made of material having translucency and an optical path conversion mirror for reflecting the signal light from the optical element and converting the optical path of the signal light formed on at least the core. The signal light is transmitted through the core by the reflection at the optical path conversion mirror. The optical path conversion mirror surface has an inclination angle \u03b1 formed with a bottom surface of the core changing in the X-direction in a cross-sectional shape in which the core is cut at a YZ plane, the Y-direction being an optical axis direction of the optical element, the Z-direction being an advancing direction of the signal light of the light guide, and the X-direction being a direction perpendicular to both the Y-direction and the Z-direction.",
            "OPTICAL WIRING ARRANGEMENT AND OPTICAL TRANSMISSION MODULE - An optical wiring mounted on an electronic device has a light transmission path for transmitting an optical signal. A function layer that reduces friction generated when coming in contact with a structural body in the electronic device to lower than when the light transmission path comes in contact with the structural body, and that bends according to deformation of the light transmission path, is arranged."

A side surface of a fixed contact faces a side surface of a movable contact. The fixed contact has an insulating layer and a base layer stacked on a fixed contact substrate, and a first conductive layer formed thereon through electrolytic plating. The side surface of the first conductive layer that faces the movable contact becomes the fixed contact (contacting surface). The movable contact has an insulating layer and a base layer stacked on the movable contact substrate, and a movable contact formed thereon through electrolytic plating. A side surface of a second conductive layer that faces the fixed contact becomes the movable contact (contacting surface).
