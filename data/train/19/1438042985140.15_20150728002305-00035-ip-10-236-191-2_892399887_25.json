Upon starting the first few weeks of school my freshman year, I felt as though I had known some of my classmates for years.

Am learning a lot Each class offers its own, unique challenge for students. With a 10 to 1 student to professor ratio, the discussions are dynamic and intellectually stimulating. Faculty offer the best quality of education possible, and are determined to see you succeed.
