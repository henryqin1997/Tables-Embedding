            "Food is always good you get to choose your meal plan which is great. Breakfast is always good you get to see the early birds (students) who have morning classes.

            "The dorms are great you get your own privacy, its like living in a small apartment you have a living room two bedrooms, and two sinks and one bathroom.

            "Its pretty decent seeing that the professors are always willing to help you out in your classes.

            "Apply early and make sure that you visit the campus when you have time because that will be the best way for you to see how it really is. Don't just take my word for it also make sure that you don't become hung up with the idea of taking afternoon classes instead of morning trust me morning classes are better because it will free up your afternoons and give you time to get a job if you want to.",
