It not only is a good place to eat, it's also nice to study. There are several options available at lunch time., 63085=IUSB just re-did The Grille and I must say that the food is very good and worth the price ! The Grille closes at 2:30 p.m so most students go to the SAC cafe and enjoy snacks, if all else fails, they are plenty of vending machines., 207467=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

The Office of Admissions offers campus visits 4 days each week where you receive a guided tour of campus from a current student and have the chance to sit down with an admissions counselor one-on-one. There are also Showcase Days offered once each month where students can come for a visit and have the chance to speak with someone from the major they are interested in. Coming for a visit will help students",
