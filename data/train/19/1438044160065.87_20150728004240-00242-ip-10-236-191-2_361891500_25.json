    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{10835=In some instances, if a pure tone audiometric signal is sufficiently loud, it can \"cross over\" and be heard by the opposite ear via bone conduction. When this occurs, it is difficult to determine if the threshold obtained is truly the threshold of the test ear, or an artifact of the non-test ear (which may have better hearing). For the current study, a crossover retesting protocol was performed whenever the observed threshold at any given frequency was poorer in one ear than the other by 25 dB at 500 and 1000 Hz; or 40 dB at any higher frequency. Retesting was accomplished using insert earphones, which are smaller and have less direct contact with the bones of the head. Thus, a much louder stimulus is required before crossover occurs. Due to the complexity of the procedure, masking was not employed in this survey., 7905=An environmental noise survey was also conducted at the beginning of each stand using the Quest 1800 sound level meter. The survey was repeated weekly throughout the stand. The audiometric test room was required to meet or exceed the specifications of ANSI S3.1-1991 for ears covered testing. A Quest Model BA-201-25 Bioacoustic Simulator and Octave Band Monitor was used to continuously measure the background noise levels in the audiometric test room during audiometric examinations. Pure tone audiometric testing was not performed if ambient noise levels in the test booth exceeded maximum permissible levels. A comprehensive calibration (traceable to NIST) of the sound level meter and bioacoustic simulator were performed annually by the manufacturer. The physical volume calibration of the Micro Audiometric Earscan tympanometer was checked at the start and end of each stand and daily throughout the stand. Air pressure was calibrated automatically by the unit each time it was turned on. The tympanometer also received an exhaustive NIST-traceable calibration check annually., 12460=The NHANES 2009-2010 Audiometry Component tested full samples of U.S. adolescents ages 12\u201319 years of age and U.S. adults ages 70+ years. Subjects using hearing aids who were not able to remove them for testing and subjects who had sufficient ear pain at the time of the exam that they could not tolerate headphones were excluded from the Audiometry Component. There were no other precluding conditions for any part of the audiologic exam., 11920=All Audiometry Component sections were performed by a trained examiner on examinees in a dedicated, sound-isolating room in the mobile examination center (MEC). Hearing threshold testing was conducted on both ears of examinees at seven frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz). Testing was conducted according to a modified Hughson Westlake procedure using the automated testing mode of the audiometer, except as indicated below. The effective range for automated audiometric testing was from \u201310 to 100 decibels (dB) at 500 to 6000 Hz and \u201310 to 90 dB at 8000 Hz. Thresholds could be tested through 120 dB (110 dB at 8000 Hz) using manual audiometric mode. Observed values, therefore, varied between \u201310 and 120 dB. If an examinee did not respond to the signal tone at any level for one or more frequencies because of deafness or severe hearing loss, a code value of 666 was entered. Manual testing was also conducted when the examinee could not operate the response switch or responded too slowly for the audiometer to accurately record the response., 6810=As an additional quality measure, all audiograms, whether conducted in automated or manual mode, tested the 1000 Hz frequency twice in each ear as a measure of the reliability of the subject\u2019s responses. Pure tone audiograms were not accepted if there was more than a 10 dB difference between them. For further details regarding any of these procedures, analysts should consult the NHANES Audiometry/Tympanometry Procedures Manual., 8915=The audiometers used in this survey met the specifications of ANSI S3.6-1996 for Type 3 audiometers. An acoustic calibration check to measure the output and linearity of the audiometer (through both standard and insert earphones) was conducted before the examinations began at each MEC site using a Quest Model 1800 sound level meter kit; a complete acoustic calibration check was also conducted at the end of each stand. Throughout the stand, output of the audiometer was monitored daily using a Quest Model BA-201-25 bioacoustic simulator, and a daily listening check (tone quality, attenuator accuracy, headphone cords, crossover, etc.) was also performed. Standard and insert earphones were checked on an alternating basis. If a unit did not meet specifications, it was sent for servicing, and a fully calibrated backup unit was used for examinations. Manufacturer\u2019s calibration (traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST]) was performed annually on each audiometer., 14530=The NHANES 2009-2010 Audiometry Examination Component consists of four parts: 1) A pre-exam audiometric questionnaire: This is a series of questions to identify conditions that would affect how audiometric testing is conducted, or how results are interpreted. Questions include whether the subject has ear tubes, a current cold or ear problem, or recent loud noise exposure. Note that more extensive data relating to a study subject\u2019s hearing status including information regarding occupational noise exposure are contained in the audiometry questionnaire (AUQ) section of the NHANES Sample Person Interview Questionnaire. 2) A brief otoscopic screening (physical) exam of the ear canals and eardrums: This was performed by the Health Technician to identify abnormalities which would require alternate audiometric procedures or influence interpretation of test results, and to identify conditions which might require medical referral. The exam screened for excessive or impacted ear cerumen (wax), physical abnormalities, or collapsing external ear canals. 3) Tympanometry: This is an objective assessment of middle ear function by testing the mobility of the eardrum in response to changes in air pressure within the ear canal. It is used to identify middle ear pathologies that might contribute to hearing loss. Tympanometric data, included in the AUX_F Audiometry data file consists of quantitative measurement variables for middle ear volume, pressure, compliance, and gradient, and tympanogram data quality ratings. The raw data for the examinee's tympanometric curves is released separately (AUXTYM_F). 4) Pure tone air conduction audiometry: This measures hearing sensitivity by presenting pure tone signals to the ear through earphones and by varying the intensity of the signals until a subject\u2019s hearing threshold at that frequency is determined. Testing is performed at frequencies across the range of human hearing., 15267=Title: Audiometry (AUX_F ) Contact Number: 1-866-441-NCHS Years of Content: 2009 - 2010 First Published: June, 2012 Revised: NA Access Constraints: None Use Constraints: None Geographic Coverage: National Subject:Audiometry, Tympanometry, Hearing Record Source: NHANES 2009 - 2010 Survey Methodology: NHANES 2009 - 2010 is a stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the U.S. Medium: NHANES Web site; SAS transport files, 3529=NHANES Audiometry examination data has been previously published for older U.S. adults during the 2005-06 survey cycle (Dillon et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2011) and for adolescents 12-19 years of age in the NHANES 2005-06 and 2007-08 survey cycles (Flamme et al., 2011; Henderson et al., 2010; Shargorodsky et al., 2010)., 9864=Instrumentation for the Audiometry Component included an Interacoustics Model AD226 audiometer with standard TDH-39 headphones and Etymotic EarTone 3A insert earphones. Tympanometry was performed using a Micro Audiometrics Earscan Acoustic Impedance Tympanometer. Audiometric calibration and background noise levels were checked using a Quest Model 1800 Precision Integrating Sound Level Meter and Model OB-300 1/3-1/1 octave filter set. Daily monitoring of calibration and ambient noise levels was accomplished with a Quest Model BA-201-25 Bioacoustic Simulator and Octave Band Monitor. All data from each of the four sections of the Audiometry Component were entered directly into the computerized NHANES survey database system. Data from the Interacoustics Model AD226 audiometer and Micro Audiometrics Earscan Acoustic Impedance tympanometer were captured electronically and uploaded into the survey information system automatically.}",
