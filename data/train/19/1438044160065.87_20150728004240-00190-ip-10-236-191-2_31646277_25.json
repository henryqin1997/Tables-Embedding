As a result all of the nearly 28,000 tickets allocated to Lehigh from November through Monday, June 23 have been sold or allotted. There are no more tickets available for purchase through Lehigh. \u00a0 \"The response to this milestone game is a real tribute to the Lehigh and Lafayette communities,\" explained Lehigh Goodman Dean of Athletics\u00a0Joe Sterrett\u00a0'76. \"Both institutions graduate students who are passionate about their experiences and friendships and who appreciate the tradition of this annual game as a time to come together and celebrate the value of their education and the relationships they developed.\u00a0 We look forward to sharing the special character of this game, our schools and our scholar-athletes with the broader audience generated by playing the game in New York at an iconic sports site.\" \u00a0 As of Wednesday morning, Lehigh has sold or allotted 27,870 tickets to the game. Initial sales in November were so strong that Lehigh opened a waiting list, which resulted in online requests for nearly 15,000 tickets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 enough to fill the permanent seating in Lehigh's Goodman Stadium. \u00a0 After exhausting its initial allotment for season ticket holders, alumni, faculty and staff last November, Lehigh opened up sales to undergraduate and graduate students (including the incoming class of 2018) in the spring, with more than 4,000 students set to be in Yankee Stadium on game day. \u00a0 People who completed Lehigh's survey between November 22 and June 20 were placed on a waiting list and had an opportunity to purchase the remainder of Lehigh's allotment on June 23. The final 3,000 tickets were sold or allocated in a mere 24 minutes. \u00a0 The seating capacity for Yankee Stadium for football is projected to be 48,100. In addition to the ticket allocations for Lehigh and Lafayette, the Yankees organization has also allocated tickets to corporate affiliates and staff associated with the stadium and team operations. \u00a0 \u00a0 Lafayette also does not have any tickets available for public sale. \u00a0 Kickoff for the 150th Lehigh-Lafayette game is set for just after 3:30 p.m. on November 22.
