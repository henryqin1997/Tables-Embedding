            "I never saw any safety issues on campus. They are very vigilant when it comes to ensure students safety.",
            "Many clubs and actives to get involved in as a student. The student actives office offers many trips and discount on movie tickets and theater tickets. A very inclusive campus.",
            "Great food with many places to choice from in different buildings. Also many vending machines in almost every building. Near fast food places as well.",
            "No dorms but very social campus.",
            "It all depend on the classes your taking and the professors. They have honor programs and teachers who will give you so much academic challenges but be worth it in the end. I never came across a teacher who didn't seem to know what they were doing.",
            "Always go in person when you need to know something about anything on campus. The staff their want to help you, they enjoy helping you. Always go on rate my professor when picking classes to see how you might be professor ranks up according to past students.",
            "I loved this school. I've been their part time for four years and I don't regret going to STCC before my 4 year college. One of the easiest college campus to figure out."

Am learning a lot In the field I am currently in, Energy systems for HVAC, I am learning a lot and the professors actually know what they are talking about.
