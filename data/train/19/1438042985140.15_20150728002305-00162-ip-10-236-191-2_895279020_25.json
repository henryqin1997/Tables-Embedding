            "There is no reason for anyone to feel unsafe on the Wittenberg campus- we have an all night escort system if you don't feel safe walking anywhere at night, along with a very present campus security team.",
            "Greek life is a big thing here, but not the stereotypical types that you think about. All of the greek houses make a point to be very respectful and give back to the community- though don't get me wrong, they have some fun too!",
            "There is over 100 clubs on campus that you could be involved in- trust me you wont just find one!",
            "If your a little unique and a leadership type figure than Witt is perfect for you! Tiger up!",
            "Well I shouldn't be telling you about this, but there are a lot of of the books traditions around campus... oh and a few secret societies... but you will have to find out about them when you get here!",
            "Its not a cheap school to attend, but you feel that money working when you live in a dorm that feels like a 5 star hotel (with a bit more community) and your classrooms and teachers are shiny and well endowed!",
            "The student activities office is always making sure there is plenty to do on the weekends, from community service projects to a Halloween party in the middle of campus. The on-campus bar is open every weekend, and on Wednesdays if your old enough to drink, along with movie nights, trivia nights, and random game nights all over campus.",
            "There is the main dining hall, which serves pretty good food for a campus cafeteria, and varies the selection each day. Also there is a cafe named Post 95 that serves really yummy burgers, pasta, wraps, or salads for the price of some WittGold. There is a decent amount of food choices available in the student center.",
            "There are seven different dorms around campus with their own individual personalities. Each are homey in their own way. Public bathrooms, although not the best, are actually easy to get used to, since they are kept very clean in every dorm. Freshmen must live with a roommate their first year, then can either live in a single, double, triple, or quad their other years. Juniors and Seniors can live in on campus housing, or in their respective sorority or frat houses.",
            "The academic programs offered are well organized, and the professors are wonderful also. Class sizes are small and intimate. Also, it is extremely easy to get in touch with your teachers. Many classes are challenging, which is to be expected, but it is always easy to find extra help if you need it. The school is experiencing some financial difficulties at the moment, and the French department is taking some hits- which ironic since it is one of the most interesting and (in my opinion) the best program there. Also there is no longer enough teachers to support a European history major, so don't plan to attend if that is something essential to you. Otherwise, the university comes highly recommended.",
            "Just be yourselves. Wittenberg is a community interested in unique and openly friendly individuals. Show that you have a love for community service and leadership and they will welcome you with open arms.",
            "Wittenberg University is it's own little world, closed off on it inside of Springfield, Ohio. It always has many interesting activities for students to be involved in, and has a great sense of community, with some of the nicest people in the United States. Don't get me wrong, there are lots of things in the city of Springfield, outside campus, that students can do as well."
