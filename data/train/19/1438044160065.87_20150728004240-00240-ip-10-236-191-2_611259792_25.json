In addition to requesting written evidence from key stakeholders, the Committee agreed to use a signposting advertisement in the three daily papers (15th February 2012) in order to attract a wider public sector and public response to its 'Call for Evidence'. This directed interested parties to a dedicated webpage on the Committee's website with the Terms of Reference for the Review, as well as the 'Call for Evidence' paper.

The SDLP did not provide a written submission, but its Party representative stated its position at the Committee's meeting of 24th April 2012 as follows:, 98845=3. The Committee requested the Political Parties and the Independent Members of the Assembly for their priorities for the Committee's immediate review of the provisions of Parts III and IV of the Northern Ireland Act, within the available timescale set out by the Secretary of State for his proposed Northern Ireland Bill i.e. proposals with the Secretary of State in June 2012. Following consideration of the responses, the Committee agreed that its immediate review would be the area of the size of the Assembly and the number of Northern Ireland departments., 86412=31. At subsequent Committee meetings of 31st January 2012 and 7th and 14th February 2012, the Committee agreed the Terms of Reference for the Review, a timeline for the Review, a Stakeholder 'Call for Evidence' paper and a list of key stakeholders to which the Committee would write to request written evidence (see Appendix 3)., 81299=39. The Committee considered oral evidence from Professor Rick Wilford (Queen's University Belfast), the Northern Ireland Local Government Association (NILGA) and the Clerk/Director General of the Northern Ireland Assembly (Mr Trevor Reaney) at its meetings of 28th February, 13th and 20th March 2012 respectively. The Minutes of Evidence (Hansards) for these oral evidence sessions and all evidence session pertaining to the consideration of this Report on Part 1 of the Committee's Review (i.e. reducing the number of MLAs) are at Appendix 2., 93711=9. The proposed Bill may be the only opportunity to make institutional changes, where Westminster primary legislation would be required, prior to the next Assembly election. The Secretary of State is seeking Assembly agreed proposals for change prior to the summer recess of 2012., 86716=30. At its meeting on 17th January 2012, the Committee considered responses from the Political Parties. It appeared, from the responses, that there was some level of agreement that the Committee reviews the area of the size of the Assembly and the number of Northern Ireland departments., 79545=42. The fifth Issue in the Stakeholder 'Call for Evidence' Paper in relation to the number of NI Government departments is primarily the focus of the second part of this Review, which the Committee has agreed to report on in late October 2012., 88042=27. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 also makes provision for Standing Committees such as the Assembly and Executive Review Committee and the Audit Committee, with Standing Orders providing for a number of further committees to assist the Assembly in discharging its functions., 102087=[3] With effect from 23 April 2011 Mr John McCallister replaced Mrs Sandra Overend, 38508=85. The SDLP's position as stated at the Committee meeting of 24th April 2012 was as follows:, 125655=The Northern Ireland Assembly is in Recess. The Business Committee will meet on the 1st of September and the\u00a0First Plenary Sitting is the 7th of September., 80738=40. The Committee considered Stakeholder submissions (Appendix 4) at its meetings of 17th, 24th April 2012 and 8th, 15th and 29th May 2012. The Minutes of Proceedings relevant to this Part 1 of the Committee's Review are included at Appendix 1., 92516=14. The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 will reduce the number of Westminster Parliamentary constituencies from 650 to 600. As a result, the number of Parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland will be reduced from 18 to 16 for the purposes of the next UK Parliamentary election. Therefore, as a direct consequence, mandated by s33 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the number of MLAs will be reduced from 108 to 96., 52329='The Ulster Unionist Party is mindful of the fact that under the Parliamentary Voting Systems and Constituencies Act 2011, Northern Ireland's representation at Westminster is to be reduced from 18 to 16, and that each constituency should have an average number of electors of 76,641.', 64524='\u2026the Boundary Commission won't be reporting on the new constituencies until October 2013\u2026 From then on there will be two different sets of constituency - Parliamentary ones and Assembly ones.

At its meeting on 27th September 2011, the Committee considered a letter from the Secretary of State (see Appendix 5) regarding a Bill that he intends to put forward in the Third Session of Parliament. The primary purpose of the Bill provides an opportunity to make changes to the Northern Ireland institutions where there is broad support among the Political Parties and where Westminster primary legislation would be required, such as future amendments to the Northern Ireland Act 1998., 103478=Ordered by the Assembly and Executive Review Committee to be printed on 12 June 2012 Report: NIA 52/11-15 (Assembly and Executive Review Committee), 46306='\u2026in 2011, female representation in the Scottish Parliament was 35%, and in the Welsh Assembly stood at 41%. It is clear that these elected bodies are more reflective of the composition of the general population than is the NI Assembly, and one could argue, more legitimate in its decision-making as a result.', 98267=4. The Committee agreed the Terms of Reference for the Review, a Stakeholder 'Call for Evidence' Paper and a stakeholder list which included all Political Parties registered in NI. It was agreed that Part I of the Review would consider and report on the number of MLAs by early June 2012., 91462=17. Section 13 of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011(PVSC Act) amended that section to provide that the Welsh Assembly constituencies are the constituencies specified in the Parliamentary Constituencies and Assembly Electoral Regions (Wales) Order 2006, as amended. The effect is that any future changes to Parliamentary constituencies made under the new rules introduced by the PVSC Act 2011 will not change Welsh Assembly constituencies., 104692=Session:\u00a02011/2012, 94246='Make a report to the Secretary of State, the Assembly and the Executive Committee, by no later than 1 May 2015, on the operation of Parts III and IV of the Northern Ireland Act 1998', 35845='The Belfast Agreement in 1998 was about inclusive government and the reduction by 12 MLA's will make for more effective government.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland intends to bring forward a Northern Ireland Bill in the Third Session of Parliament. The primary purpose of the Bill is to effect changes relating to political donations in Northern Ireland.

This relates directly to the Assembly and Executive Review Committee's power to:, 94046=8. With the Secretary of State seeking to introduce this Bill in the Third Session of Parliament, the Assembly and Executive Review Committee agreed that it would take forward an immediate review of a key area in relation to the operation of Parts III and IV of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 much earlier than planned., 54956=In relation to direct implications, the PVSC Act 2011, \"moves us from 16 to 15 or up to 17, and that then creates a fluidity where you are never quite certain,\" and, \"\u2026if we say that we want the Westminster constituencies to continue to be our constituencies in the Assembly, then we are never in control as an Assembly of the number of people who are being elected to this place.

The committee system is recognised as being a crucial component of modern parliamentary systems and is particularly important in unicameral legislatures such as the Assembly. The current committee system is a product of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (as amended) and the Assembly's Standing Orders. As might be expected the Northern Ireland Act requires the Assembly's Standing Orders to make provision for establishing 'statutory committees'., 91639=16. Section 2 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 specifies that the National Assembly for Wales's constituencies are the parliamentary constituencies in Wales., 100113=[1] SDLP only made a verbal submission to the Review, through its Party representative on the Committee at the Committee meeting of 24th April 2012., 83867=The Assembly and Executive Review Committee will review the potential benefit of streamlining governing institutions, focusing on the number of MLAs elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as a result of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 and any further reductions for the next Assembly election; and on the reduction in the number of Northern Ireland departments and associated re-allocation of functions., 10403=122. The reality for Northern Ireland is that the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 (PVSC Act 2011) will affect the number of Westminster constituencies in Northern Ireland in time for the next NI Assembly election (2015). The current number of Westminster constituencies in Northern Ireland (18) will be reduced to 16. As the number of MLAs is directly linked to the number of Westminster constituencies (per Section 33 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998), the total number of MLAs elected in 2015 would automatically be 96 \u2013 compared to the current 108. For the purposes of Committee deliberations, this is known as the default position., 54012=SDLP stated that should the PVSC Act 2011 become law, \"it leaves the question of the size of the Assembly only partially in the hands of this Assembly because another part of the decision-making framework will remain (unless we take the decision to decouple), outside of our hands \u2013 something that we don't believe is necessarily in the best interest for this region\". Also highlighted the point that it is understood that, during the time of the negotiations of the Good Friday Agreement, that the purpose of coterminosity at the time was to avoid the inevitable delay of creating a boundaries commission in NI in order to establish a series of constituencies \u2013 a practical solution at the time., 67824=Furthermore, the current changes that are being undertaken in local government will result in a significant decrease in the number of local councillors \u2013 a major change in local government and local representation. To add to this impending change, there will also be an automatic change in the number of MLAs via the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 (16 Westminster constituencies rather than 18). With such upcoming changes to both local and national government, UUP would like to let the change to 96 MLAs stabilise before going any further. On using local government boundaries, UUP raised the point regarding the practicalities of an election returning a large number of candidates for big constituencies like Belfast.}",

The Deputy Chairperson: We move on to the review of Parts III and IV of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 in the context of reviewing the size of the Assembly and the number of Departments. The purpose of this agenda item is for the Committee to consider and agree the wording of the revised terms of reference for its review, a detailed stakeholder list and a revised timetable for the review.

Its report was published in July 2009 and identified savings of approximately \u20ac5b across government departments. It further recommended the closure of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, stated that the need for a Department of Arts, Sports & Tourism should be 'critically examined'. The report was met with substantial criticism from trade union and other representative groups. However, the Taoiseach said that no area could be immune from cuts[18]., 671540=In summary, the Bill provides for a referendum to be held on 5 May 2011 on the Parliamentary voting system and seeks to reduce the number of Parliamentary constituencies from 650 to 600.

The Chairperson: We will move on to the review of Parts III and IV of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 in the context of reviewing the size of the Assembly and the number of Departments.

The consultation was a result of a provision contained in the Scotland Act 1998 that any reduction in the number of Scottish constituencies at Westminster would automatically reduce the number of MSPs. In 2002 the Boundary Commission for Scotland published provisional recommendations that would have reduced the number of Scottish Westminster constituencies from 72 to 59. As a consequence, the number of MSPs would have been cut from 129 to 104. During the passage of the Scotland Act 1998, the Government gave a commitment that it would listen to any concerns individuals or organisations may have had about a reduction in the number of MSPs. In a statement on the consultation to the House of Commons, the then Secretary of State for Scotland commented:, 685835=[7] Third report of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee: 'Parliamentary Voting System Constituencies Bill', October 2010, 389258=4 House of Commons Reform Committee (2009) 'Rebuilding the House', 12 November 2009., 628456=2 April 2012, 643021=7.

Tabled 10/03/2011., 503842=1.15 Analysis of the most recent election results in 2011 shows that all five of the larger political parties in Northern Ireland would have continued to be represented if constituencies had only four members each.12 Beyond these parties, Mr Jim Allister of the TUV and Mr Steven Agnew of the Green Party both only won the sixth seat in their respective constituencies. Therefore, they would not have been elected in either a four member or five member per constituency assembly. The only likely difference in the 2011 results, then, would have been that Independent MLA Mr David McClarty would not have been elected under the four-member model, but may have retained his seat with five members.13,14, 984741=Paper 000/00 14 May 2012 NIAR 327-12, 930701=The Scottish Parliament, however, has no legislative competence in relation to the work of the Boundary Commission and it is the Secretary of State for Scotland who is required by the Scotland Act 1998 to lay before the UK Parliament, as soon as is practicable after receipt of the report, the draft of an Order in Council giving effect to the recommendations contained within it., 752023=These scenarios must be considered in the context of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and Standing Orders. The Agreement requires that statutory committee places are offered to all members, while Standing Orders require that a place is offered to Members who are not Ministers or junior Ministers. By convention, Ministers do not sit on committees, although there is no statutory bar to them doing so. The scenarios presented in the paper assume that this convention will remain in place. If Strand One of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement is interpreted all members who are available to take up committee places (i.e. excluding the Speaker and Executive Ministers/Junior Ministers) must be offered such a place, then scenarios where the ratio of committee places to available Members drops below 1.00 would seem to be problematic., 500075=1.8 Therefore, we favour moving toward a four-member per constituency model, which, if there were 16 parliamentary constituencies, would mean an assembly of 64 MLAs. This option has the advantage that, if the current boundary review for any reason does not meet with the approval of Parliament and 18 constituencies remain in Northern Ireland at the next Westminster election, there will still be a considerable reduction in Assembly size to 72 MLAs, which falls comfortably within the 57 to 80 range suggested by the analogues (see 1.12). Our suggestion is that the Assembly moves towards a 64 seat model over 3 elections, in order to enable MLAs to grow accustomed to the arrangement and to test the effects of a smaller number of representatives. I.e. 2015 96 MLAs. 2019 80 MLAs. 2023 64 MLAs., 982706=[14] Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 2008 (2008 c.7) http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2008/7/contents, 655585=The Commission on the Powers and Electoral Arrangements of the National Assembly for Wales (the Richard Commission) was appointed in July 2002. Its job was to examine the powers and electoral arrangements of the Assembly and to produce an independent report. One of its recommendations was that the Assembly should receive enhanced law-making powers and that the number of Assembly Members should therefore be increased from 60 to 80 to deal with the anticipated increase in workload. In the event, the Assembly did receive enhanced powers but there was no concurrent increase in the number of AMs., 14166=13th March 2012, 978825=[2] Scotland Act 1998 (1998 c.46) http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/contents, 557516=Date: 23 February 2012, 618809=27th September 2011 \u2013 Correspondence to the Secretary of State of Northern Ireland, 18504=The Committee noted correspondence from the Secretary of State of 24 October 2011 and a subsequent Committee request letter to Political Parties in relation to their priorities for the Committee's immediate work programme reviewing Parts III and IV of the NI Act., 792886=[21] http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/976/contents/made, 916669=The total number of people registered to vote at the May 2011 Assembly election, however, was 1,210,009, an increase of 94,038 from the 2007 Assembly election and an increase of 114,458 from the 2003 Assembly election.

We have draft terms of reference, which can be found at tab 6 of today's folder. That has been developed on the basis of the Committee's consideration of the subject area to date, taking into account the key points raised by members following briefings from the Assembly's Research and Information Service on the size of the Assembly and Assembly structures. In short, it is proposed that the purpose of the review is to consider the discrete subject of the size of the Assembly in terms of the number of MLAs. As proposed and agreed at the Committee's meeting on 17 January, the issue of coterminosity or decoupling from Westminster constituencies has been included in the draft terms of reference for consideration today., 909051=During the same periodic review (albeit reporting after the 2005 elections), the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland did not recommend any changes to the number of constituencies in Northern Ireland (18) and the Boundary Commission for Wales recommended the retention of the same number of constituencies in Wales (40). The Boundary Commission for England recommended an increase of 4 in the number of constituencies in England (533). The present size of the House of Commons following the 2010 general election, therefore, was 650., 236248=441. Finally, in the third scenario, we worked out what would happen if something between those two scenarios happened; for example, if there were a 5% drop in England. In theory, we would then drop down to 15 in 2015, but there probably would not be a boundary review report anyway at that date., 14230=17th April 2012, 634263=b. The deputy First Minister reiterated the view that F/dFM want to engage with party leaders on this matter and are eager to expedite their work on this in 2012., 498274=1.5 The Northern Ireland Assembly was given an anomalously large number of members when it came into being in 1998. Using the December 2010 electoral statistics that provide the basis for the boundary review under the 2011 Act, there are 38,372 electors per member of the Welsh Assembly, 30,893 electors per member of the Scottish Parliament, but only 11,131 electors per member of the Northern Ireland Assembly.1,2, 619936=9th May 2012 \u2013 Correspondence from Director General of the NI Assembly, 905942=The legal framework which determines the number and distribution of UK Parliamentary constituencies is contained within the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 (the 2011 Act). This Act significantly amended the previous framework contained within the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 (the 1986 Act), 671924=The Bill was introduced to Parliament on 22 July and received its Second Reading on 6 September. A Programme Motion[2] was published which allowed for five days in Committee of the Whole House and two days for Report and Third Reading. The Deputy Prime Minister rejected criticism of the use of a Programme Motion during the Bill's Second Reading:, 81198=46. The Committee Clerk: Thank you. A revised draft terms of reference can be found at tab 3. It has been developed based on the Committee's discussions and decisions at its meeting on 31 January 2012., 814697=[6] Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament (revised November 2011), 654389=With regards to the potential impact on the Committee system, respondents to the consultation had raised the issue that \"even given the present number of MSPs, they were under strain to scrutinise, research and legislate\"[9]. The Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004 removed the link between constituencies for the Scottish Parliament and those for Westminster, meaning that the reduction in Scottish Westminster constituencies to 59 did not affect Scottish Parliament constituencies. A similar decoupling between Westminster and Assembly seats in Northern Ireland would require a change to Section 33 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998., 223472=415. Mr Campbell: We are not going into closed session to discuss something that we would just prefer was not in the public domain. The nature of the discussion is such that, whatever perspective any of us take, either of our own proposal or, more importantly, those of others, it will become fodder for Twitter accounts and the subject of discussion in the public domain. It is an exchange of views to try to get to a common position. I do not know why we would want to create some form of media interest in an exchange of position papers and the analysis of each other's positions, which, as we all know \u2014 as Simon and I and others have outlined and made clear on other occasions \u2014 is going to be decided in another room anyway. Do we want to raise, today and next week and every other week, media interest in what some people might regard as navel-gazing? It would get to the point at which I cross-examine Conall on what he said about the nomenclature that requires change. Why did he not do that in 1998, when the agreement was set up? I just do not see the point in that. It would be creating an unhealthy appetite for the media personnel about something that has really no substance. Where is it going to end? It would be preferable to discuss and get into the meat of each other's proposals here, come out the other side and let whatever follows beyond that happen., 752907=The current committee structure in the Assembly is straightforward \u2013 there is one statutory committee for each Executive Department. However, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 does allow for the possibility of committees with cross-cutting remits. Both the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales have restructured their committee system to better reflect the requirements of those institutions., 619007=19th January 2012 \u2013 Correspondence to the First Minister (FM) and deputy First Minister (dFM), 745322=Section 29 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 legislates for the composition of committees in the National Assembly for Wales. Section 29(2) requires the provision in standing orders to secure that appointments to the places on each committee are, if possible, to be determined by a resolution of the Assembly which secures that the membership of that committee reflects, so far as is reasonably practical, the overall representation of political groups in the Assembly. The allocation of places on committees between different political groups[11] is determined by a resolution of the Assembly which secures that the membership of that committee reflects, so far as is reasonably practical, the overall representation of political groups in the Assembly. If this cannot be done by resolution, then places must be allocated using the d'Hondt method[12]. Provision must be made in the standing orders for securing, so far as is reasonably practicable having regard to the total number of committee places available, that a place on at least one committee is available for every Assembly member who does not belong to a political group, and that the total number of committee places allocated to each political group is at least equal to the number of Assembly members belonging to that group[13]., 816010=[11]http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmproced/writev/1370/1370.pdf, 756671=[9] Schedule 3 Scotland Act 1998 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/schedule/3, 14262=24th April 2012, 166154=264. In relation to the specific questions posed by the Committee, I am of the opinion that the main implication of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 and any further reduction in the number of MLAs will be a reduction in the amount of Member time available to undertake parliamentary functions. Unless changes are made to Assembly structures and processes that maximise the contributions that Members make to key parliamentary roles and enable Members' time to be used to the greatest effect, that is likely to reduce the capacity of the Assembly and its Members to deliver the full range of functions of the Assembly. That is likely to require significant reform of our current arrangements and careful consideration by Members of how they balance their various roles and prioritise the work that they undertake., 755565=[5] Gemma Rosenblatt, 'A Year in the Life: from member of public to Member of Parliament', Hansard Society, 2006., 789686=[6] Report of the Consultative Steering Group on the Scottish Parliament, The Scottish Office 1998, accessed November 2011, 642900=6.

The Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 established new Northern Ireland Departments and renamed some departments. The six departments at the time of the Belfast Agreement were agriculture, economic development, environment, education, health and social services, finance and personnel., 232233=436. However, in 2011, the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act came into force, which totally changed the way in which seats would be allocated to the different parts of the United Kingdom. The Act set the number of seats for the whole of the UK at 600. Four of those were historical seats, which left 596 to be distributed among the different parts of the UK. That legislation introduced a big change: it stated that those 596 seats would be distributed using a mathematical formula, which removed a lot of scope for the Boundary Commission to make arguments that it thought were more reasonable. One would apply what is known as \u2014 and I am sure that my pronunciation will be wrong \u2014 the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb formula. That sets out how 596 seats would be allocated to different parts of the United Kingdom., 700351=Paper 000/00 19 October 2011, 591437=3. The structures and process which embedded the Belfast Agreement into shaping post-conflict Northern Ireland make little attempt to ensure robust mechanisms for gender parity. In 2001 The Sex Discrimination (Election of Parliamentary Candidates) Act 2001 permits political parties to undertake positive action to reduce inequality in the number of women and men elected, but its provisions have been little used by the political parties.\u00a0, 480036=1.2 The motivation to review coterminosity presumably emanates from the reduction in constituencies that will come about in 2013 as a result of the 2011 Act. In Wales, where the 2011 Act will have the greatest impact, through reducing the number of Westminster seats from 40 to 30, it has been decided to end coterminosity., 72535=9. On the subject of timescales, a detailed \u2014 or not so detailed \u2014 proposed timescale has been tabled today. That takes into account the fact that, as members will recall, the Secretary of State wrote to the Committee on 24 October 2011, stating that there was the potential for legislative changes to be delivered by a Bill in the third session of the Westminster Parliament. That, in itself, presents a challenge in that the Secretary of State has asked this Committee to conclude its review and to report to the Assembly de facto in early June 2012. The proposed timetable has been tabled for members' consideration later in the meeting., 668472=[13] Statement from the Office of First Minister (Designate) and deputy First Minister (Designate) 18 December 1998, 714705=Section 29 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (as amended by the St. Andrew's Agreement Act 2006), gives effect to Paragraph Nine of Strand One of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement.

I remind members that the fifth issue in our stakeholder 'Call for Evidence' paper on the number of Northern Ireland Departments is primarily the focus of the second part of the review, which the Committee has agreed to report on in late October of this year.

There is an additional line at the end of paragraph 3.5, which brings out the direct consequence of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 as regards reducing the number of MLAs from 108 to 96., 722831=Although it is difficult to quantify the amount of time an MLA spends on constituency work compared to Assembly duties, the results of a survey undertaken by the Hansard Society in 2005 are useful in the absence of data for Northern Ireland., 684585=[1] 'The Coalition: our programme for Government' http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/409088/pfg_coalition.pdf May 2010, 915963=It is worth noting that the system of electoral registration in Northern Ireland is different to that elsewhere in the UK. In Northern Ireland, electors are required to register on an individual basis and provide certain personal identifiers including National Insurance Number and signature. GB operates the 'household' registration system, whereby one member of a household can register all other eligible residents living there. Northern Ireland operated this system until 2002, and individual registration will be implemented in GB in 2014. In Northern Ireland, the first register published under individual electoral registration (IER) in December 2002 showed a decline of around 10%., 711116=Section 2 provides background to why the Committee is undertaking this review. Section 3 outlines the background to the committee structure in the Assembly, referencing the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, Northern Ireland Act 1998 and Standing Orders. Section 4 details the scenarios listed above while section 5 provides comparisons with committee activity in the Scottish Parliament. Section 6 provides an overview of the committee structure in the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales and section 7 offers conclusions and issues for further consideration., 811903=Prior to the 2010 Parliamentary election, the Wright Committee recommended:, 912518=The 2011 Act provided for a 5-year cycle of reviews by each of the boundary commissions and the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland started its 6th review of parliamentary constituency boundaries on 4th March 2011. The review has to be completed before 1st October 2013 and the 2011 Act also prescribes the electorate to be used for the purposes of the review; the relevant electorate being that at the 1st December 2010 Parliamentary electorate. Application of the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb formula as prescribed by the 2011 Act results in the allocation of seats as set out in Table 1 below., 272179=3.18. Section 29 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 states that the Committees will 'advise and assist each Northern Ireland Minister in the formulation of policy with respect to matters within his responsibilities as a Minister'. It also confers on these committees the powers described in paragraph 9 of the Belfast Agreement., 917951=Furthermore, any potential drop in the number of people registered will not be evident until after the 2015 UK Parliamentary election, after which there would be time to rebuild the GB electoral register. However, the full impact of introducing IER in GB remains to be seen., 687863=This briefing paper looks at the key provisions relating to Northern Ireland in the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act (the Act) which received Royal Assent on 16 February 2011. The Act has two key components - it provides for a referendum to be held on 5 May 2011 on the voting system for UK Parliamentary elections and reduces the number of Parliamentary constituencies in the UK from 650 to 600., 13890=8th November 2011, 642738=4.

In relation to this matter, the Committee office received a letter dated 2nd April 2012 regarding the '2012 Review of the Institutions' from the Executive Party Leaders' Group, which identified a number of key themes, which the AERC might usefully consider within the context of its Review [Appendix 5] . Many of the key themes listed are included in the Committee's Call for Evidence and Terms of Reference of its current Review. The Committee may wish to consider the themes not included in the Review in future Reviews., 18784=The Chairperson highlighted that Parties have been asked to provide a response by 8 November 2011., 650465=2 Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body Annual Accounts 2008-09, 819373=[22] This is a result of provisions in the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, 619601=9th March 2012 \u2013 Correspondence from Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), 484741=1.13 Given our wish to retain coterminosity, the requirement to retain the STV system and assuming that the reduction in constituencies in the 2011 Act comes into being, our analogues thus suggest two options:, 659682=Consideration would also need to be given to the impact a reduction in the number of MLAs would have on the ability of smaller parties to secure representation. However, it could be argued that smaller parties have fared less successfully since the election of the first Assembly in 1998., 676908=Under the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 the four Boundary Commissions are required to carry out reviews every eight to 12 years. The Bill would increase the frequency of reviews to every five years, with the first report under the new rules due by 1 October 2013., 872402=This section provides a breakdown of plenary and committee business in the Northern Ireland Assembly and Scottish Parliament.

The previous Assembly and Executive Review Committee had recommended that its successor Committee undertake a review of this issue in the context of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 (PVSC Act 2011). The PVSC Act 2011 will reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 with the result that Northern Ireland will lose two constituencies. This means that the number of MLAs will be reduced from 108 to 96 because Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies are the same., 667507=[9] Responses to the 'size of the Scottish Parliament \u2013 a consultation', Scotland Office 1 December 2002, 80030=7 February 2012, 678119=Furthermore, the Bill contains provisions to decouple the constituencies for elections to the National Assembly for Wales from Westminster, as the new electoral quota is expected to significantly reduce the number of Parliamentary constituencies in Wales, and this would have potentially reduced the number of Assembly seats to 45. No similar provisions exist for Northern Ireland and the number of Northern Ireland Assembly seats will automatically drop to 90 for the purposes of the 2015 Assembly election if the Bill passes and Northern Ireland is reduced to 15 constituencies[8]., 679082=If the PVSC Bill receives Royal Assent, the referendum will take place on the same day as other elections to the Scottish parliament, National Assembly for Wales, Northern Ireland Assembly and local elections in England and Northern Ireland. This means that voters in Northern Ireland will be asked to vote in three separate polls on 5 May 2011. Minister of State Hugo Swire said that this will be more convenient for voters and his officials would work closely with the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland and the Electoral Commission to ensure \"the identification and early resolution of any potential problems\"[9]., 280045=2.3. With the Secretary of State seeking to introduce this Bill in the Third Session of Parliament, the Assembly and Executive Review Committee agreed that it would take forward an immediate review of a key area in relation to the operation of Parts III and IV of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 much earlier than planned. The proposed Bill may be the only opportunity to make institutional changes, where Westminster primary legislation would be required, prior to the next Assembly election. The Secretary of State is seeking Assembly agreed proposals for change prior to the summer recess of 2012., 669393=[17] E-mail from OFMDFM 17 August 2010, 985077=Following presentation to it of a paper entitled 'Electoral Constituencies', the Assembly and Executive Review Committee, at its meeting on the 8 May, agreed to commission further research seeking '\u2026any evidence to suggest that the electorate in Scotland and Wales finds the separate boundaries for local/regional/Westminster elections (a 'three-tiered system') confusing'., 788786=[2] Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament (revised November 2011) accessed 28 November 2011, 70252=2.

To date, I have had no substantive response to it., 13959=22nd November 2011, 926489=The Scotland Act 1998 as enacted provided that one member of the Scottish Parliament would be returned for each constituency (under the simple majority system) and that Members of the Parliament for each region would be returned under the additional member system of proportional representation. Schedule 1 of the Scotland Act 1998 contained provisions setting out the constituencies and regions for the purposes of the Act. These were (a) the Orkney Islands (b) the Shetland Islands and (c) the parliamentary constituencies in Scotland, except a parliamentary constituency including either of those islands. The Schedule also provided that there would be eight regions ( the European Parliamentary constituencies) and that seven regional members would be returned for each region., 22711=The Chairperson reminded the Members that the deadline for submissions from Political Parties in relation to this Review was 7 November 2011 and requested that Members should do all within their power to get Party responses to the Committee Secretariat as soon as possible., 756358=[8] Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Legacy paper 8th Report, 2011 (Session 3) SP Paper 633 ELLC/S3/11/R8 http://archive.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/committees/ellc/reports-11/edr11-08.htm, 633993=a.

Furthermore in 2008 the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) made recommendation regarding women and politics in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is important to note that the UK and the RoI have both accepted the Convention which therefore obligates the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly to fulfil their commitment to undertake a series of measures to promote women at all levels of decision-making. The Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2008 state:, 278859=2.1.

Table 1 in the research paper shows the impact of applying the formula to the population as at 2010. The legislation specified that you would take a period of two years and 10 months before the Boundary Commission was due to report. We know that the Boundary Commission is to report in October 2013. Therefore, going back to December 2010 and based on the electorate at that time, the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb formula gives you the number of seats. This is how we have come to the new allocation of seats, which gives Northern Ireland 16 constituencies. Sainte-Lagu\u00eb is a bit like d'Hondt. There are iterations. The first seat goes to England, and you then work through the rest. For Northern Ireland to get its sixteenth seat, the number was in the low 560s. It would be close to the end. It may not have got the sixteenth seat. Perhaps it would be close to 15 when you go through the iterations., 13994=17th January 2012, 686674=[10] BBC News online: 'Scottish government anger at vote reform disrespect' http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10484082 retrieved 21 October 2010, 238728=447. The Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004 decoupled the seats. In place of the link to the defined parliamentary constituencies, the new legislation stated that the number of constituencies would be 73. Of those constituencies, two were fixed and the rest were defined by using the existing Westminster boundaries. They took the boundaries as they were, and said, in the legislation, that those would be the Scottish parliamentary boundaries., 851834=In a 2002 report on the legislative process, the Committee on Procedures considered whether committees should be given the power to amend Bills. The Committee concluded that there would need to be an extensive period of consultation, particularly with the Executive, before any such change was introduced[21]., 786797=The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003 amended the minimum number of public meetings of the Board from 10 to 8[20]. The following table shows the number of meetings per year since 2008., 208140=373. On the second point, about the impact of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Alliance Party supports the reduction in the number of MLAs that will come about because of that Act from 108 to 96. Indeed, it would be supportive of a further decrease by reducing the number of MLAs per constituency from six to five to provide the Assembly with 80 Members. The Alliance Party cautions against going below five Members per constituency., 623119=At its meeting of 29 February 2012, the Committee for Education received a briefing from the Early Years Strategic Alliance regarding their Manifesto., 512853=3 From examination of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the Scotland Act 1998 and the Government of Wales Acts 1998 and 2006., 789936=[7] CONVENERS GROUP LEGACY PAPER - SESSION 3, accessed 28 November 2011, 731592=The following tables compare the number of meetings held by statutory committees in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the subject committees in the Scottish Parliament in the 2007-11 mandate. The Scottish Parliament was chosen as the National Assembly for Wales did not receive significant legislative power until late in the previous mandate. In total, there were 1,636 statutory committee meetings in the Assembly, compared to 1,077 in the Scottish Parliament. The figures raise interesting questions about the resource intensiveness of committee meetings in the Assembly. If the number of members is reduced but members are still expected to sit on more than one committee then consideration may need to be given to meeting less frequently, for example fortnightly. Furthermore, previous research has identified that committees in Northern Ireland have a relatively low recurrence rate for agenda items. This was specifically in relation to agenda item looking at matters relating to public bodies. The research stated: \"This reflects the fact that in the round Northern Ireland\u2026.covered more public body type items but in less depth (i.e. they were more likely to have them on the agenda once and only once)\"[7]., 642642=3.

The Committee system is recognised as being a crucial component of modern parliamentary systems and is particularly important in unicameral legislatures such as the Assembly. The current committee system is a product of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (as amended) and the Assembly's Standing Orders. As might be expected the Northern Ireland Act requires the Assembly's Standing Orders to make provision for establishing 'statutory committees.', 619749=2nd April 2012 \u2013 Correspondence from Executive Party Leaders' Group, 771761=7 December 2011, 710066=This research paper has been prepared to inform the Assembly and Executive Review Committee's review of Parts 3 and 4 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.

Reserved matters in Schedule 3 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, on which the Assembly may legislate if approved by the Secretary of State., 252890=472. There is a further section of the paper that I almost forgot. Members asked whether there was any indication that turnout had been affected by the change in boundaries. I probably almost forgot it because the answer is that there is no evidence of that whatsoever. The picture is also confused because significant changes took place in 2007, when the single transferable vote (STV) system was introduced for local authority elections in Scotland. The new ballot paper contained the regional and constituency members in Scotland. I think that everyone agreed that there was a lot of confusion around that 2007 election. It would be speculation to say whether that will feed into subsequent elections. Scotland has decoupled its Scottish Parliament and local government elections; they used to happen on the same day, but that has changed because it created a lot of confusion. With that, I will take questions., 97485=107. Mr McDevitt: Given what is in the research papers, under the heading of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, I see that you point out that that is what will happen. I think that we need to issue a disclaimer, which research validated for us, that if there were a change in the number of registered people in England, for example, the number of constituencies in the North of Ireland could go back up. Therefore, the size of Assembly size could increase if we were to stick with the coupled model. I think that the assumption out there is that it is one-way traffic \u2014 that it can only ever go down \u2014 which is not true, as we have established., 14062=7th February 2012, 869271=[15] Conan McKenna, Parliamentary scrutiny by committee: Ireland in context. A comparative study on issues and effectiveness in parliamentary committees, Queen's University Belfast, 2011, 125106=171. I am kind of conflicted about this issue, but the broad point is that, on balance, if you had 16 constituencies, you fixed on having 16 and were able to plan on the basis of having 16 with five Members in each constituency, you could think ahead. What you would not have to worry or be concerned about is whether there is going to be a further boundary redistribution in Northern Ireland in the wake of the next general election in 2015, because that might force us to think yet again. We might then have to seek to influence the Executive in becoming sensitive to the kind of concerns that this place would have about the effectiveness with which it then scrutinised the Executive. So, I think it would give you surety and continuity., 138272=203. First, we commend the review. It is timely. It forms part of the Programme for Government and is, indeed, a target within it. NILGA's political leaders \u2014 the representatives of the five political parties \u2014 came together specifically to look at this review of the Assembly and the Departments. We hope to gain further comment and corporate approval from our executive and full membership on 23 March., 647332=In terms of population, the number of MLAs is disproportionately higher when compared to the number of elected representatives in the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament. In response to an Assembly question asked in June 2010 regarding the number of Assembly members, the Office of the First and deputy First Minister gave the following response:, 899527=Please note that the following table provides information for the week beginning 23 April 2012., 622987=Date: 1 March 2012, 700608=The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 reduced the number of Parliamentary constituencies from 650 to 600.

Originally populated with between 9 and 11 Members, this has grown to around 14. During this period, the number of places to be filled on all temporary and statutory committees has doubled from 275 to 576[21]. There are currently 650 MPs but this number will reduce to 600 for the purposes of the 2015 UK Parliamentary election[22]. The number of committees has risen from 24 to approximately 39, requiring a number of Members to serve on two or more committees. The convention that Parliamentary Private Secretaries and Opposition front-benchers do not serve on committees has had to be breached to service the demands of the committee system., 272522=3.19. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 also makes provision for Standing Committees such as the Assembly and Executive Review Committee and the Audit Committee, with Standing Orders providing for a number of further committees to assist the Assembly in discharging its functions., 783916=This equates to an average of approximately 2 hours from 2006 to 2010., 109546=148.

Although the deadline for written submissions on the call for evidence paper is 28 March, we hope that some key stakeholders may make their submissions before that date. I seek Committee agreement that, if any written submissions are received from key stakeholders before the Committee's next meeting, Committee staff, in consultation with myself and the Deputy Chairman, write to members to advise them of the submissions and the stakeholders who might be invited to provide oral evidence at the next meeting or the following meeting., 285531=3.9. Section 13 of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011(PVSC Act) amended that section to provide that the Assembly constituencies are the constituencies specified in the Parliamentary Constituencies and Assembly Electoral Regions (Wales) Order 2006, as amended. The effect is that any future changes to Parliamentary constituencies made under the new rules introduced by the PVSC Act 2011 will not change Assembly constituencies., 904590=This briefing paper was requested by the Assembly and Executive Review Committee following its meeting on 17 April 2012. It provides information relevant to consideration of the following issues:, 689026=The legislation was the subject of considerable debate in Parliament. Concerns were raised that a Bill proposing major constitutional change was being rushed through Parliament at the expense of proper scrutiny and that the Government had failed to take into account the elections scheduled to the devolved institutions on 5 May. In the event, the Bill only just received Royal Assent in time for a referendum to be held on 5 May. The Conservatives had accused Labour peers in the House of Lords of filibustering the Bill in an attempt to delay its passage and had threatened to use the guillotine motion to move the debate forward. One of the last hurdles was cleared when the House of Lords voted against an amendment insisting on a voter turnout threshold of 40% for the result of the referendum on the voting system to be binding., 834650=Following the introduction of the Scotland Act 1998, the Consultative Steering Group (CSG) was established to determine how the Scottish Parliament would carry out its business.

As you may be aware, the Committee will produce two reports on this Review \u2013 one in relation to its consideration of the size of the Assembly and another in relation to the number of NI departments. Regarding the Committee for Education's point regarding consideration of a Department of Children and Young People, the latter report may be the most relevant. It is expected that AERC will report on this issue in October 2012., 933231=The local government boundaries might be considered more stable than the UK parliament boundaries which given the 2011 and Table 2 below allocates 108/96/80 Members to each district based on the electorate at 2009., 131627=183. I suggest that there is merit in thinking thematically. I know that it was looked at; in fact, Mark Durkan did so in 1998. At that stage, he was not persuaded, largely I think because of the uncertainties and the political difficulties that obtained at the time, rather than due to principled opposition. It may be that, now that they are bedded down in other devolved jurisdictions in the UK, we can draw lessons, positive and negative, from their experiences. I think that they have some merit.

The Constitution Unit, University College London, 2009, 114958=155. My last point in relation to section 4 of the stakeholder paper is that there is no perfect model for a Committee system. That is a particularly important point. I cannot point to an ideal type and say, \"This is the optimal type of Committee system that you should emulate\". There are a number of factors that influence Committee effectiveness and, indeed, efficiency, one of which is workload management and the way in which that is mustered in each of the Statutory Committees. There is a kind of symbiotic relationship between what goes on in this place and the decisions that are made in the devolved Departments, particularly in respect of the legislative agenda, and one of the concerns is about the need for better planning of Executive legislation and better sequencing and scheduling of legislative business. That is essential. The situation that emerged in the Assembly towards the latter part of the last mandate in 2011 was that those in the Bill Office were running around like headless chickens; they are not headless, because they are terribly efficient people, but you take my point. There was an immense amount of legislative work that had to be done towards the latter stages of the last mandate. I think that that made life very difficult not just for the Bill Office but for the Committees. I, therefore, think that better phasing of the Executive's legislative programme is important., 784049=115 committee meetings took place between May and the start of December 2011, lasting a total of 177 hours and 48 minutes.

The section substitutes a new Schedule 2. Rule 1 of the new Schedule 2 sets the number of constituencies in the UK at 600. Rule 2 provides for there to be less variation in the size of the electorate in each constituency than at present: the electorate of each constituency is required to be within 5% either side of the UK electoral quota. The UK electoral quota is the number of people in the UK on the electoral register published two years and ten months before the date by which the Commissions' reports are to be submitted less the electorate on that date of the protected constituencies named in Rule 6, divided by 596, i.e. the number of constituencies in the UK (600) less the four protected constituencies in rule 6., 588845=28 March 2012, 619473=13th March 2012 \u2013 Correspondence to NIPSA, 62527=The Committee discussed points raised in a letter that was issued to AERC Members from the Chairperson on 17th May 2012 regarding Political Parties' views on the number of MLAs and decoupling., 981004=[9]http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120123/text/120123w0001.htm, 279104=II. make a report to the Secretary of State, the Assembly and the Executive Committee, by no later than 1 May 2015, on the operation of Parts III and IV of the Northern Ireland Act 1998; and, 979112=[3]Parliamentary Constituencies (Scotland) Order 2005 (2005 No. 250 (S. 1)) http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/250/made, 649090=The following table compares salaries and other costs of elected representatives in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

The purpose of this agenda item is for the Committee to consider and agree the final wording of the revised terms of reference for its review, the revised stakeholder call for evidence paper and a signposting advertisement for the review. I propose to take each of those areas in turn. I will ask the Committee Clerk to speak to the memo at tab 2 of today's pack, starting with the revised terms of reference at tab 3. Are members agreed? If so, I ask the Committee Clerk to speak to the revised terms of reference., 741800=The Scotland Act 1998 does not provide the level of detail relating to committees as that found in the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Schedule 3 of the Scotland Act 1998, entitled 'Standing Orders \u2013 Further Provision', provides for Standing Orders to appoint committees and sub-committees of the Scottish Parliament[9]. The Scottish Parliament has two main types of committee \u2013 mandatory and subject committees. Standing Order 6.4.1 of the Scottish Parliament allows for the establishment of subject committees[10]. A committee established by the Scottish Parliament to deal with a particular subject, other than a mandatory committee or a committee (including a Committee of the Whole Parliament, a Consolidation Committee, a Statute Law Repeals Committee, a Statute Law Revision Committee or a Private Bill Committee) established only to take certain Stages of a particular Bill, is referred to as a subject committee., 633801=4.

Committee Stages of Bills 23rd April 2012, 645143=Section 33 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 states that six members shall be returned from each of the parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland. A 108 member Assembly is more than twice the size of the old Northern Ireland house of commons and 30 more than the 1974 Assembly[1]. The 1995 Framework Documents envisaged about 90 members being returned to a local Assembly, equating to five-seat constituencies. Senator George Mitchell and his co-chairmen who chaired the talks that led to the Belfast Agreement recommended increasing the number of seats per constituency from five to six or having a top-up of 10 to 20 seats. The intention behind this was to provide greater opportunities for smaller parties to be represented[2]., 514289=14 Commentary in this paragraph based on http://www.eoni.org.uk/index/elections/elections-2011-results-and-statistics/ni-assembly-election-2011-results-by-stage.htm, 668011=[11] 'Serving Scotland Better: Scotland and the United Kingdom in the 21st Century', June 2009, 980209=[6]http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/1/notes/division/5/2/2, 511365=2.15 Such a move would be consistent with changes in Whitehall.

I will talk members through the paper. The introduction includes the niceties that the Committee is well familiar with in terms of the powers, the proposal from the Secretary of State on the opportunity for a Bill that could change the Northern Ireland Act 1998 through Westminster, and the terms of reference for the review, subject to the amendment agreed earlier. It also highlights matters outside the scope of the review, as was mentioned earlier. Pages 4, 5, and 6 are background notes. Those are primarily to inform stakeholders of the factual position and the legislative position on the issues that are subject to the review. Many of them are drawn from research papers that have been presented to the Committee. That has been drafted as a factual document to inform stakeholders., 982034=[12] Government of Wales Act 2006 (2006 c.32) http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/contents, 629929=I understand that the First Minister and deputy First Minister are also due to meet with the Chair and vice Chair on 4 April which will provide an opportunity to discuss the issues in more detail., 931098=In relation to the National Assembly for Wales a similar decoupling has occurred. Section 13 of the 2011 Act made specific provision in relation to the National Assembly for Wales. This section amended section 2 (in addition to Schedule 1 and paragraph 1 of Schedule 11) of the Government of Wales Act 2006[12] to specify that the Assembly constituencies are the constituencies specified in the the Parliamentary Constituencies and Assembly Electoral Regions (Wales) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/1041), as amended.[13], 110460=150. The Chairperson: There is no other business. The next meeting will take place on 28 February at 11.00 am in this room. Thank you for your co-operation., 626809=At its meeting of the 7 March 2012, the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister considered the response from the First Minister and deputy First Minister to the Chairperson of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee (AERC) dated 27 February 2012., 689932=The Act sets the date for the referendum as 5 May but it may be held on any date before 3 October if an Order is made to that effect. Voters will be asked to vote 'Yes' or 'No' on the following question:, 687442=8th March 2011, 240444=450. As the paper points out, a broadly similar process took place in Wales, which has now decoupled. That happened under the 2011 Act. They also locked down the existing constituencies as their parliamentary seats. That may be an issue for the Committee to think about. When Scotland and Wales decoupled, they went with the existing Westminster seats. Part of the Committee's deliberations, I understand, has been about Northern Ireland going down to 16 seats, but the Boundary Commission is not due to report until October 2013, and those 16 seats do not exist. I am not sure whether there is a technical issue around that, but it may be something that the Clerk and the Committee may like to consider. If that were to become the preferred option, how would you go about drafting the legislation?, 683089=Rule 7 therefore provides that if the difference between the Northern Ireland electorate and the UK electoral quota multiplied by the number of seats in Northern Ireland exceeds one third of the UK electoral quota, and in the opinion of the BCNI it would unreasonably impair their ability to take into account the factors set out in rule 5, or would make the preparation of their report so complex that they would be unable to comply with the deadline for the submission of their report in section 3(2) of the 1986 Act, then the BCNI may propose constituencies that vary from the upper or lower limits imposed by rule 2 by a fixed amount, being the difference between the UK electoral quota and the electorate of Northern Ireland as it exists on the review date divided by the number of seats allocated to Northern Ireland under rules 3 and 8., 765942=In Scotland, the number of women elected in 2011 was 45, resulting in the second lowest number of women MSPs in four Scottish Parliament elections at 35%. The 2007 election produced the lowest number at 33%., 767568=Section 2 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 specifies that the National Assembly for Wales constituencies are the parliamentary constituencies in Wales. Section 13 of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011(PVSC Act) amended that section to provide that the Assembly constituencies are the constituencies specified in the Parliamentary Constituencies and Assembly Electoral Regions (Wales) Order 2006, as amended. The effect is that any future changes to Parliamentary constituencies made under the new rules introduced by the PVSC Act 2011 will not change Assembly constituencies., 643281=10. Further information on plenary and committee business in the NI Assembly and other legislatures 3rd May 2012, 246083=461. Scotland is different because the decoupling took place in 2004, so the 2005 Westminster elections in Scotland were held with the reduced number of constituencies. In 2010, they were also held with the reduced number of constituencies, whereas the Scottish Parliament elections in 2007 and 2011 were held within the old Westminster constituencies. Therefore, there is a difference there., 813175=[2] Standing Orders of the House of Commons Number 73 Printed December 2010 Accessed: 4th April 2012, 92806=95. The evidence gathering for phase 3 of the report would commence mid-February, but the consideration of that evidence as a discrete area \u2014 the number of Departments \u2014 would start immediately after summer recess in September and go through to report stage at the end of October. That is the revised timetable., 927967=Under Schedule 1 to the Scotland Act 1998, as amended by the Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004, the Boundary Commission for Scotland is responsible for reviewing the constituencies and regions of the Scottish Parliament, and making recommendations to the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Boundary Commission for Scotland, however, does not have the power to alter the total number of constituencies or to alter the fact that 2 of these constituencies will be the Orkney Islands constituency and the Shetland Islands constituency., 703737=[2] Assembly Motion, tabled 06/06/2011.

The project website states that 'The legislative process in the UK House of Commons has long been criticised, in particular with relation to its committee stage. Almost uniquely amongst established, developed parliamentary democracies this is taken in non-specialist and temporary ('public bill') committees, rather than specialist, permanent committees'. The research, therefore, is '\u2026seeking to contribute to the evidence base in support of reform of the way in which the House of Commons deals with legislation by investigating how legislative committees function in other jurisdictions'. The final report based on the research is planned for release in spring 2012., 262815=511. The Chairperson: We now move to the consideration of a draft motion for a debate of the report in an Assembly plenary sitting, which is included in members' packs. At this point, the Committee secretariat has received an indication that the day for the motion to be debated will be Monday 25 June. Are members content with the wording of the draft motion for debate in the Assembly plenary sitting?, 716112=The current structural relationship between the Northern Ireland Assembly's statutory (departmental) committees and Northern Ireland departments is therefore relatively straightforward - there is one committee for each Executive department. However section 29b of the 1998 Act would appear to allow for alternative arrangements in that it enables a \"committee to be so established either in relation to a single Northern Ireland Minister or in relation to more than one\". Therefore it appears to allow for the possibility of committees with cross-cutting remits., 686390=[9] BBC News Online: 'Swire goes ahead with plan for three polls on 5 May', http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-11547203 retrieved 20 October 2010, 867309=[7] Cabinet Office, Programming, retrieved 11 August 2010, 788059=The Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Devolution of Policing and Justice Functions) Order 2010[21] transferred certain functions in relation to the Board from the Secretary of State to the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice. However, responsibility for amending the legislation remains within the remit of the UK Government, including, for example, the number of political members and their method of appointment., 250923=469. So the commission was clear from its research, focus groups and consultations that there was no confusion among voters, and this was after the 2005 Westminster election, for which the boundaries had changed. However, the commission, as I said, saw the desirability of not having too many different boundaries, and its solution was to focus on alignment with local council boundaries. The commission recommended:, 24510=The Chairperson reminded the Members that the deadline for submissions from Political Parties in relation to this Review was 7 November 2011 and requested that Members should do all within their power to get outstanding Party responses to the Committee Secretariat as soon as possible., 284292=3.5. The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 reduced the number of Westminster Parliamentary constituencies from 650 to 600. As a result, the number of Parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland will be reduced from 18 to 16 for the purposes of the next UK Parliamentary election. Therefore, as a direct consequence mandated by s33 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the number of MLAs will be reduced from 108 to 96., 985467=This paper provides information relating to coterminosity of electoral boundaries in Scotland, where the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004 decoupled Scottish Parliament constituencies from Westminster constituencies. Westminster elections based on the number of constituencies being reduced from 72 to 59, following the Boundary Commission's Fifth Periodic Review, took place in 2005 and 2010. The paper also contains information on turn out at elections in Scotland., 913125=Section 33 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998[7] states that the members of the Assembly shall be returned for the parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland and that each constituency shall return six members. As it stands, therefore, the number of members of the Assembly will reduce from 108 to 96, as a result of losing two Westminster constituencies under the changes produced by the 2011 Act., 230520=434. I will take members through the paper. It is probably helpful to set out the legislative framework before the recent legislation, the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, came into force. The Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 set out the rules for the redistribution of seats across the United Kingdom. As enacted, there were certain constraints placed on the number of seats that there could be in any one part of the United Kingdom. In Great Britain, there should not be substantially greater or fewer than 613 seats; the number of constituencies in Scotland should not be fewer than 71; in Wales, that number should not be fewer than 35; and the number of constituencies in Northern Ireland should not be greater than 18 or fewer than 16, and should be 17. Of course, we have 18 seats currently. I think that that happened back in 1995, when West Tyrone became the new constituency. Perhaps a member of the Committee knows more about the reasoning behind that than I do., 904332=Paper 000/00 3rd May 2012 NIAR 327-12, 770106=[4] The Electoral Commission, Report on the National Assembly for Wales general election 5 May 2011, October 2011, 819962=Paper 000/00 23 April 2012 NIAR XXX-12, 765467=It has been suggested that under AMS fair representation for women and people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds is increased. At the 2011 National Assembly for Wales election 24 women were elected, equalling the 40% achieved in 1999. In 2003, the Assembly became the first legislature in the world to have equal representation for both men and women.[8], 805880=In 2008-09 the House of Commons Reform Committee (the Wright Committee) recognised the pressure faced by select committees:, 740839=The examples of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales are instructive as both institutions have restructured their committee systems since they were established. In the Scottish Parliament, there is no legislative requirement to ensure that all members must be offered a place on a committee. The situation in Wales more closely reflects Northern Ireland as the Government of Wales Act 2006 states that committees should reflect the political balance of the Assembly and that independents should, if possible be offered a committee place. However, it does not go so far as to state that all Members must be offered a place. Although operating under greater constraints, Section 29b of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 does allow for the possibility of cross-cutting committees. Therefore, it seems that changes to the committee system could be made within the existing legislative framework., 681257=Combined elections in Northern Ireland are not new with the UK Parliamentary elections in 2001 and 2005 both combined with local government elections. There is some evidence to suggest that combined elections can lead to increased voter confusion. For example, at the 2005 combined UK Parliamentary/local government elections approximately 20,000 votes were spoiled, compared to just over 6,000 at the 2007 Assembly election. It should be noted that at the previous combined elections in 2001 and 2005, voters had to use two voting systems (first-past-the-post for Westminster and single transferable vote (STV) for the Assembly). The proposed combined election in May 2011 would use STV for both Assembly and local government elections, with voters asked to place an 'X' against their preferred option in the referendum., 791259=[13] http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Annualreportsandaccounts/SP_Stats_2007-08.pdf, 272815=3.20. Section 17(4) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 allows for up to 10 Ministers with departmental responsibilities, although this can be amended [for example, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Amendment of Schedule 3) Order 2010 allowed for the transfer of policing and justice functions]. Under section 21(3) of the 1998 Act, a department under the First and deputy First Minister is not included in the 'up to 10' Ministers figure. The current number of government departments was arrived at following inter-party negotiations, primarily between the UUP and SDLP, which were concluded on 18 December 1998. The subsequent report from the First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate) stated:, 484269=1.12 From all of the above relevant analogues, therefore, it appears that the minimum efficient Assembly size is in the region of 55 to 60 members, with an absolute range for the appropriate size of 57 to 80 members. What is clear is that both the current Assembly of 108 members and the reduced Assembly of 96 members that will result from the application of the 2011 Act will be well above the suggested range and well in excess of any of our analogues., 701875=In terms of developments that have occurred in the past year surrounding the size of the Assembly, the following motion was tabled by the Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party on the 6th June 2011:, 92045=94. The Committee Clerk: The proposed timetable for the review has been revised to take into account the wider scope of the review's terms of reference that were agreed at last week's meeting, and the phased approach. It is set out at tab 5 in three phases. In mid-February, the plan is that the Committee will begin evidence gathering for the review. That would continue right up to Easter. After Easter, we would move into phase 2 of the review, the consideration of and preparation of a report on the number of MLAs in the Assembly. The plan is that the report would be ready to be signed off by the Committee and be presented to the Assembly towards the end of May or early June. There may be a plenary debate in June, before summer recess., 623867=Assembly and Executive Review Committee Room 242 Parliament Buildings Tel: 028 9052 1787 E-mail: john.simmons@niassembly.gov.uk, 700914=The Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland is currently engaged in the sixth review of Westminster Parliamentary constituency boundaries and the review has to be completed before 1st October 2013., 766917=Both the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales make it clear that Members must not describe themselves as regional Members if they are constituency members, and vice versa.

Variations in the size of the electorate, which itself will be determined by the size of the population eligible to vote and the level of registration within the eligible population, have the potential therefore to require a change in the number of seats in parts of the UK following each five year reviews., 619117=27th February 2012 \u2013 Correspondence from First Minister (FM) and deputy First Minister (dFM), 712786=The current statutory committee system in the Northern Ireland Assembly is set out in the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, Northern Ireland Act 1998 and Standing Orders.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland intends to bring forward a Northern Ireland Bill in the Third Session of Parliament. The primary purpose of the Bill is to effect changes relating to political donations in Northern Ireland. However, it also provides an opportunity to make changes to the Northern Ireland institutions where there is broad support among the parties and where Westminster primary legislation would be required, such as future amendments to the NI Act 1998. This relates directly to point II of the Committee's remit above., 194826=329. The First Minister and the deputy First Minister also said that they were taking that forward actively by meeting with Executive party leaders with the aim of reaching political agreement. They also referred to the Assembly and Executive Review Committee's (AERC) existing review, as well as previous reviews, when considering exploring options and presenting views to the Assembly and to that group. However, they emphasised in the end that it is a political matter for party leaders of the Executive to negotiate. They must agree a way forward for post-2015 structures and the review that the Committee is involved in., 866887=[5]Parliamentary stages of a Government Bill, House of Commons Information Office, August 2010, 236947=445. Mr Moore: I will try to pick up where I left off. I was briefing the Committee on the research paper, which looks at the impact of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011. It contains scenarios that we worked out by putting some projections into the formula that is in the Act. I will recap very briefly. Projecting forward on the basis of registration, as it is, we see the number of Westminster seats in Northern Ireland reducing to 15 and staying at 15. We then modelled figures on the basis that individual registration in England would reduce registration levels to those comparable with here when it was first introduced here. That sees the number of seats here rise to 17 and eventually reduce to 16. Scenario 1, which is method C, shows that if something between those two scenarios happens, the number of seats would stay at 16. Perhaps that is the best way to say it. In theory, the number would go down to 15, but there would be no Boundary Commission review in 2015, so, by the time of the next one, it would be at 16. Those figures, and our projections, are not what we are saying will happen; we are simply saying that this is what could happen under certain circumstances. We are showing that there is the possibility of variation in the number of seats. However, we are not saying that this will or will not happen., 138939=\"The instigation of integration, collaboration, co-operation, innovation, improvement, and efficiency practices embedded in the evolving Assembly, as deployed by councils informally for many years and formally since late 2011, in order to manage performance and continuously improve the institutions / services in question thus ensuring a value for money ethos at the core of all that is carried out (whether MLA, official, service provider or outsourced body).\", 192920=324. The Acting Chairperson: The purpose of this agenda item is threefold: first, for the Committee to consider the note on the meeting that the Deputy Chairperson and the Chairperson had with the First Minister and the deputy First Minister on 4 April 2012; secondly, for the Committee to consider the written submissions on the review that have been received to date; and, thirdly, to receive an Assembly research paper titled 'Scheduling Parliamentary time'.

If passed, the legislation will require the four Boundary Commissions in the UK to review the existing arrangements and submit their reports before 1 October 2013. The Bill does not allow for a separate determination of Assembly and Westminster constituencies, so any changes to the number of constituencies in Northern Ireland will automatically impact on the number of MLAs returned to the Assembly. The Bill contains technical arrangements to allow for more variation around the number of electors per constituency, given the relatively small the size of Northern Ireland., 631459=2.

On page 2, there is a list of sources that address the issue of decoupling in some form. It goes back to the consultation on the size of the Scottish Parliament in 2001. That consultation asked whether there would be problems if there were decoupling. The paper looks at the responses and at the further decision to reduce the size of the Scottish Parliament and decouple. The paper then looks at the Arbuthnott commission, which was set up to address, among other things, the potential for confusion. The consultation on the size of the Parliament looked at the relationships between MPs, MSPs, councillors and the electoral administrator role, and possible confusion or difficulties they might have, as well as confusion among the public., 557788=At its meeting of the 22 February, the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister considered correspondence from you regarding the Review of the Size of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Number of Government Departments., 201763=362. If members have no views on that, we will move on to the second issue. It relates to the implications of the forthcoming reduction in constituencies via the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 and any further reduction in the number of MLAs. Again, members, look at the second column in the summary analysis. Seven of the 21 respondents stated explicitly that the number of MLAs should be reduced. They gave suggestions for appropriate numbers, ranging from 96 to 60 and a few points in between: 80, 72 and 64 were suggested. The vast majority of remaining respondents either offered no views on the matter or offered views on ways in which to mitigate the impact of a smaller Assembly. If members have no views to express at this stage, I will move on., 926158=The Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales have 'de-coupled' their constituencies from Westminster constituencies.

The implications for Northern Ireland in the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 are self-evident: there will be an automatic reduction of the Assembly from 108 to 96 Members should the Act become law. The further implication is that it leaves the question about the size of the Assembly only partially in the hands of this Assembly, because another part of the decision-making framework will remain, unless we take a decision to decouple, outside of our hands \u2014 something that we do not believe is necessarily in the best interests of this region., 10560=135. For example, Professor Wilford stated, 'A more carefully planned and timed legislative programme would enable Committees to undertake a greater volume of draft legislative scrutiny'. Following its consideration on this area, the Committee agreed that it would be useful to share the various views with the Chairpersons' Liaison Group (CLG) of all Assembly Committee Chairpersons. Therefore, the Chairperson wrote to CLG on 15th May 2012 (see Appendix 5). The letter highlighted the Committee's discussion on some issues regarding the Committee System and the various opinions and views expressed by stakeholders, including the need for a fundamental review of the Committee System if there is to be a change in the size of the Assembly, as follows:, 193809=326. The Committee Clerk: I remind Committee members that the purpose of that meeting was to clarify what work is being done or is planned for 2012 on the reduction in the number of Departments post-2015 by the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) or the efficiency review panel., 792072=[17] Explanatory Note to the PVSC Act 2011, 619226=1st March 2012 \u2013 Correspondence from Education Committee, 982337=[13] The Parliamentary Constituencies and Assembly Electoral Regions (Wales) Order 2006 (SI 2006 No. 1041) http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1041/contents/made, 917335=We have learnt from the experience in Northern Ireland and are phasing in IER over two years.

This will be supported by an Electoral Commission publicity campaign[9]., 105850=134. The Committee Clerk: There have been a number of changes to that paper, and they reflect the points raised by Committee members at last week's meeting. As summarised in the note at tab 2, there is more specific reference to the current number of MLAs, the number of constituencies and the implications of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011. I am referring to the background notes. On page 5 of the call for evidence paper, there is more background information on decoupling. Paragraph 3.24 on page 8 contains more information on the position with the Department for Employment and Learning.

Joined-up government is not a panacea in itself. It kind of folded when it was attempted by the Blair Governments because of what we academics call the besetting sin of departmentalism. Officials and Ministers tend, one way or another, to become incredibly turf conscious, very introverted and defensive. I think that, now that we are in a much different place than we were between 1998, 1999 and 2002, that should be taken advantage of and a rethink should be undertaken about how we could better design our Executive and, consequentially, how the Assembly could be better designed. I think that is a symbiotic relationship. I do not think it is one whereby the Assembly or its Committees should just trot dutifully in the wake of what the efficiency review panel ends up recommending. However, the space and the time are short for you to do that job., 672698=The Bill had its fifth and final day in Committee on Monday 25 October before moving to Report Stage on 1 November. It had its First Reading in the Lords on 3 November., 593399=285. The Committee calls upon the State party to take measures, with benchmarks and concrete timetables, to increase the number of women in political and public life, at all levels and in all areas, in the light of its general recommendation No. 23 on women in political and public life. It also recommends that the State party introduce temporary special measures, in accordance with article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention and general recommendation No. 25, to strengthen its efforts to promote women to positions of leadership. To that end, the Committee urges the State party to increase the availability of training and capacity-building programmes for women wishing to enter or already in public office and to enhance its awareness-raising campaigns on the importance of women's participation in political and public life. The Committee also calls for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) in Northern Ireland.[1], 668718=[14] Michael Keating, The Government of Scotland: public policy making after devolution (2nd edition), Edinburgh University Press 2010, 655156=Furthermore, the findings of the Calman Commission, which was set up to review the workings of Scottish Devolution, reported in 2009 that \"although (the Commission) received some representations\u2026suggesting that there are too many MSPs, we have not seen anything to convince us of a case for change\"[10]., 5869=127.

However messy or not messy it might turn out to be, the issue of overlapping briefs, and how and by whom they are managed, is very important. For me, that means the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM). It should have a strategic role, and it should be hollowed out to assist it in that role. The business of recruiting functions to OFMDFM back in the late autumn and winter of 1998-99 was just a mess basically. Things happened that were largely official driven. A lot of functions ended up in OFMDFM that could find a better home elsewhere across the Executive. It is an untidy office that should not be laden with as many functions as it has. It needs to step back and operate on a more strategic basis and to think clearly across government. That is where the administrative reorganisation needs to start., 710598=It explores the scope for reducing the number of members on statutory committees in the context of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, Northern Ireland Act 1998 and Standing Orders of the Assembly. Where appropriate, it draws comparisons with the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales., 658367=The argument that reducing the number of MLAs would be a good idea is a popular and easy argument to make, especially in terms of the number of MLAs in relation to population size. However, less consideration has been given to the implications a reduction would have on the work of the Assembly. Some of the issues that might potentially arise can be found in responses to the 2001 Scotland Office consultation on the size of the Scottish Parliament, which reflect a number of concerns about a potential reduction in the number of MSPs:, 816336=[12] Welsh Assembly (2012), \"Assembly Timetable 19 September 2011 \u2013 20 July 2012\" See: http://www.assemblywales.org/bus-home/assembly_timetable.htm, 768949=The PVSC Act 2011 did not contain provision to amend Section 33 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998., 981326=[10] Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act (2004 c.13) http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/13/contents, 747462=In June 2011, the NAfW established the following five 'thematic' committees to carry out these functions:, 686097=[8] Section 33(1) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 states that the Members of the Assembly shall be returned for the parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland, 685272=[4] HC Deb 7 June 2010, c 137, 622661=Committee for Education Room 241 Parliament Buildings Tel: +44 (0)28 9052 21821 Fax: +44 (0)28 9052 1371, 644534=A potential reduction in the numbers of MLAs and government departments was considered by the Committee on the Preparation for Government which met between June and October 2006.

The Chairperson: We move on to the review of Parts III and IV of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 in the context of reviewing the size of the Assembly and the number of Departments. The purpose of this agenda item is for the Committee to consider and agree the approach to its review and the terms of reference for the immediate review work up to the end of June 2012., 778894=4 Percentage attendance figures at committee meetings in the Northern Ireland Assembly 2007-11, 813403=[3] Commons Select Committee Inquiry: Sittings of the House and Parliamentary Calendar http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/procedure-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/sittings-of-the-house-and-the-parliamentary-calendar/, 827477=The Committee Stage of Public Bills in the House of Commons has undergone significant transformation in recent years. In 2006 the Modernisation Committee produced a report which recommended that the system of standing committees should be replaced by Public Bill Committees. The \"old standing committee system, though vital to the legislative process, was deemed ineffective by numerous commentators on parliament and had long faced pressure for reform. Ad hoc and unspecialised, standing committees lacked many of the features characteristic of effective committees found in other parliaments around the world\"[2]. These reforms also empowered the new Public Bill Committees to take \"evidence and submissions in relation to Bills\"[3]., 14383=12th June 2012, 231539=435. So, that was the position as enacted. The Scotland Act 1998 removed the number of seats in Scotland in anticipation of a reduction in the number of Scottish MPs and changed the rules about the number of seats and how you would allocate them. The fifth boundary review reduced the number of seats in Scotland by 13, taking it from 72 to 59. The important point to make about that legislation is that it specified minimum numbers, but that there was scope for some variation above those numbers, or, in the case of Northern Ireland, between a lower and higher number. There was scope for the Boundary Commission to come up with numbers that it thought were most appropriate., 730978=It must also be noted that the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales are not subject to the provisions of the PVSC Act 2011. The Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004 removed the statutory link between the Scottish Parliamentary constituencies and those for the House of Commons. This ensured the number of MSPs remained at 129, even as the number of MPs was reduced. The PVSC Act 2011 contained provision to ensure that the number of members in the National Assembly for Wales will not be affected by changes to Westminster boundaries., 14353=29th May 2012, 480376=1.3 However, there are two reasons why Wales's circumstances differ from those in Northern Ireland. Firstly, the change in the number of Westminster constituencies is very much larger, even when considered on a proportionate basis (a 25% reduction versus an 11% reduction). Secondly, the Additional Member Voting System employed for Welsh Assembly elections made it extremely difficult to retain coterminosity. It would probably have entailed either a consequential large reduction of 10 seats in the Welsh Assembly (which only has 60 members at the moment) or a compensating increase in the number of members elected by regional list. It was decided that neither of these were desirable and so coterminosity was ended. This is not the case under the STV system in Northern Ireland, as there is no distinction between constituency and list members, and, although coterminosity does imply a reduction in the number of MLAs, changing the number of MLAs elected per constituency can be used to effectively offset this, if desired. Thus, although the 2011 Act implies a reduction in MLAs from 108 to 96, if this was considered to result in too small an Assembly, the number of MLAs per constituency could be increased to seven (thus creating an Assembly of 112, close to the current numbers)., 28132=Agreed: The Committee agree to write to the First Minister and deputy First Minister to clarify what work is being done or planned for 2012 in relation to a reduction in the number of Government departments post-2015 by OFMDFM and/or the Efficiency Review Panel., 241259=451. Another issue that we were asked to look at was what would happen if we looked at the new local council areas as the constituencies and allocated Assembly Members across those. We have tried to do that. The Local Government (Boundaries) Order (Northern Ireland) 2012 was laid last month. We conducted a simple exercise, which was to use data from 2009 to look at the historical electorate, work out the percentage of the overall electorate for each of the new areas and allocate the number of Members based on that percentage. It is a straightforward process, and, in the paper, you can see how the numbers divide up. You can see that, because the size of the electorate differs significantly in each areas, so would the number of Members in each district, if you were to say that each district would have Members allocated in relation to the size of the electorate. In a 108-Member Assembly, the district with the highest number of Members would be Belfast, with 18, and the lowest, in an 80-Member Assembly, would be the district of Fermanagh and Omagh with five Members. That is not to say what should happen but to show what could happen almost as a starting point. It shows that how you then subdivide some electoral areas is an issue, because Belfast appears to be extremely large., 663826=On 9 April 2009 OFMDFM released a statement saying that after Easter of that year it was their intention to bring forward proposals for the creation of an Efficiency Review Panel for approval. It went on to say that the Panel would report later in 2009., 285364=3.8. Section 2 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 specifies that the National Assembly for Wales constituencies are the parliamentary constituencies in Wales., 660038=Section 17(4) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 allows for up to 10 Ministers with Departmental responsibilities, although this can be amended. For example, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Amendment of Schedule 3) Order 2010 allowed for the transfer of policing and justice functions. Under section 21(3) of the 1998 Act a department under the First and deputy First Minister is not included in the 'up to 10 Ministers' figure. The current number of government departments was arrived at following inter-party negotiations, primarily between the UUP and SDLP, which were concluded on 18 December 1998[13]. The Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 established new Northern Ireland Departments and renamed some existing departments. The six departments at the time of the Belfast Agreement were agriculture, economic development, environment (Northern Ireland), education, health and social services, finance and personnel., 756877=[10] Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament, April 2011 http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/so/so_final.pdf, 76570=22.

The other 22 Bills progressed by Accelerated Passage (no Committee Stage)[22]., 907520=Section 86 of the Scotland Act 1998[2] made a number of significant changes to the rules contained in Schedule 2 of the 1986 Act. These changes included the removal of Rule 1(2) which meant that there was no longer a guaranteed minimum number of Scottish seats at Westminster. In addition, further rules were altered with the effect that for the first Boundary Commission review of Parliamentary Constituencies undertaken following the enactment of the Scotland Act 1998 the electoral quota for England rather than a quota based on existing Scottish constituencies would be used to determine the appropriate number of Scottish seats at Westminster., 979434=[4] Parliamentary constituency boundaries: the Fifth Periodical Review House of Commons Library (July 2010) Standard Note: SN/PC/03222 http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03222.pdf, 870694=[21] Committee on Procedures: Review of the Legislative Process in the Northern Ireland Assembly, January 2002}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Regional government in the South of Ireland is organised on a different basis, for example, the 8 Regional Authorities, established in 1994, to promote the co-ordination of public service provision and to monitor the delivery of EU Structural Fund assistance in the regions, draw members from groups of county councils, The members of the Regional Authorities are not directly elected, but nominated from among the elected members of the local authorities in the region. Each local authority has a certain number of seats on a Regional Authority, based loosely on the population of the local authority area. The size of the Regional Authorities varies from 22 members in the Mid-East region to 38 members in the Border region, with an average of 17,888 people per member. 16657 108 1,799,000 Northern Ireland 50107 60 3,006,400 Wales 40481 129 5,222,100 Scotland No of devolved govt reps per head of popn Number of devolved government representatives Population (30 June 2010) \u00a0 NILGA is of the view that, whatever the final decision, it must be easily understood by, and well communicated to, the public. The current co-terminosity with Westminster boundaries is clear and easy to understand. An additional system of boundaries specific to the Assembly would add a layer of complexity to existing arrangements. Continued alignment with the Westminster boundaries will have the effect of reducing the number",
    "textAfterTable": "The final decision on the number of constituencies and MLAs will require a detailed political discussion and agreement between the NI Executive and the political parties. NILGA is of the view that it would rather see an arrangement which fosters very clear and productive communication and partnership decision-making between separate tiers of government in Northern Ireland \u2013 regional and local - rather than concentrate primarily on a preferred number of MLAs per se. If this Review was holistic and \"whole system\" driven, that is, inclusive of the representation and devolution within the UK and inclusive of the role of local government, it would move away from a sterile \"less is better\" debate. There is a direct and necessary case to populate each tier of government based on what it has to do, for example, in Wales there are fewer AMs because local government fulfils more functions. NILGA believes that there is sufficient political capacity at local level (benchmarked against Scotland and Wales) which is not being utilised. It is important that the consultation is not engulfed into a very mechanical debate based on the political structure being assessed on an almost managerial basis. The Assembly is a political institution. Consequently the representational role of the politician needs to be pivotal. Nothing is gained by having a small political institution that can run itself functionally, but where members",
