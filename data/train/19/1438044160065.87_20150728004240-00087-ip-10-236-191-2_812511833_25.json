    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6023=The W3C's XML 1.0 Recommendation was first issued in 1998, and despite the issuance of many errata culminating in a Third Edition of 2004, has remained (by intention) unchanged with respect to what is well-formed XML and what is not. This stability has been extremely useful for interoperability. However, the Unicode Standard on which XML 1.0 relies for character specifications has not remained static, evolving from version 2.0 to version 4.0 and beyond. Characters not present in Unicode 2.0 may already be used in XML 1.0 character data. However, they are not allowed in XML names such as element type names, attribute names, enumerated attribute values, processing instruction targets, and so on. In addition, some characters that should have been permitted in XML names were not, due to oversights and inconsistencies in Unicode 2.0., 14438=XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the SGML Editorial Review Board) formed under the auspices of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996. It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special Interest Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also organized by the W3C. The membership of the XML Working Group is given in an appendix. Dan Connolly served as the Working Group's contact with the W3C., 24273=An implementation report is available at http://www.w3.org/XML/2006/06/xml11-2e-implementation.html. A Test Suite is maintained to help assessing conformance to this specification., 23499=This document is governed by the 24 January 2002 CPP as amended by the W3C Patent Policy Transition Procedure. W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy., 26339=On 29 September 2006 this document was edited in place to remove a number of spurious and potentially misleading spaces., 4714=In addition, XML 1.0 attempts to adapt to the line-end conventions of various modern operating systems, but discriminates against the conventions used on IBM and IBM-compatible mainframes. As a result, XML documents on mainframes are not plain text files according to the local conventions. XML 1.0 documents generated on mainframes must either violate the local line-end conventions, or employ otherwise unnecessary translation phases before parsing and after generation. Allowing straightforward interoperability is particularly important when data stores are shared between mainframe and non-mainframe systems (as opposed to being copied from one to the other). Therefore XML 1.1 adds NEL (#x85) to the list of line-end characters. For completeness, the Unicode line separator character, #x2028, is also supported., 26208=The English version of this specification is the only normative version. However, for translations of this document, see http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byTechnology?technology=xml11., 25925=This document is a W3C Recommendation. This second edition is not a new version of XML. As a convenience to readers, it incorporates the changes dictated by the accumulated errata (available at http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V11-1e-errata) to the First Edition of XML 1.1, dated 4 February 2004. In addition, the markup introduced to clarify when prescriptive keywords are used in the formal sense defined in [IETF RFC 2119], has been modified to better match the intent of [IETF RFC 2119]. This edition supersedes the previous W3C Recommendation of 4 February 2004.}",

However, portions of the contents of the external subset or of these external parameter entities may conditionally be ignored by using the conditional section construct; this is not allowed in the internal subset but is allowed in external parameter entities referenced in the internal subset., 141737=In an encoding declaration, the values \"UTF-8\", \"UTF-16\", \"ISO-10646-UCS-2\", and \"ISO-10646-UCS-4\" SHOULD be used for the various encodings and transformations of Unicode / ISO/IEC 10646, the values \"ISO-8859-1\", \"ISO-8859-2\", ... \"ISO-8859-n\" (where n is the part number) SHOULD be used for the parts of ISO 8859, and the values \"ISO-2022-JP\", \"Shift_JIS\", and \"EUC-JP\" SHOULD be used for the various encoded forms of JIS X-0208-1997. It is RECOMMENDED that character encodings registered (as charsets) with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority [IANA-CHARSETS], other than those just listed, be referred to using their registered names; other encodings SHOULD use names starting with an \"x-\" prefix. XML processors SHOULD match character encoding names in a case-insensitive way and SHOULD either interpret an IANA-registered name as the encoding registered at IANA for that name or treat it as unknown (processors are, of course, not required to support all IANA-registered encodings)., 5484=This section defines some symbols used widely in the grammar., 85443=XML attribute types are of three kinds: a string type, a set of tokenized types, and enumerated types. The string type may take any literal string as a value; the tokenized types are more constrained.

This grammar is known as a document type definition, or DTD. The document type declaration can point to an external subset (a special kind of external entity) containing markup declarations, or can contain the markup declarations directly in an internal subset, or can do both. The DTD for a document consists of both subsets taken together.], 36761=The replacement text of a parameter entity reference in a DeclSep MUST match the production extSubsetDecl., 20672=Note that the grammar does not allow a comment ending in --->. The following example is not well-formed., 173811=The formal grammar of XML is given in this specification using a simple Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation. Each rule in the grammar defines one symbol, in the form, 48833=the single character #x2028, 19092=[Definition: Comments may appear anywhere in a document outside other markup; in addition, they may appear within the document type declaration at places allowed by the grammar. They are not part of the document's character data; an XML processor MAY, but need not, make it possible for an application to retrieve the text of comments. For compatibility, the string \"--\" (double-hyphen) MUST NOT occur within comments.] Parameter entity references MUST NOT be recognized within comments., 198213=Algorithms exist which allow many but not all non-deterministic content models to be reduced automatically to equivalent deterministic models; see Br\u00fcggemann-Klein 1991 [Br\u00fcggemann-Klein]., 48975=The characters #x85 and #x2028 cannot be reliably recognized and translated until an entity's encoding declaration (if present) has been read.

Given the following declarations: It is an error if an attribute value contains a reference to an entity for which no declaration has been read. All attributes for which no declaration has been read SHOULD be treated by a non-validating processor as if declared CDATA. Note that if the unnormalized attribute value contains a character reference to a white space character other than space (#x20), the normalized value contains the referenced character itself (#xD, #xA or #x9). This contrasts with the case where the unnormalized value contains a white space character (not a reference), which is replaced with a space character (#x20) in the normalized value and also contrasts with the case where the unnormalized value contains an entity reference whose replacement text contains a white space character; being recursively processed, the white space character is replaced with a space character (#x20) in the normalized value.
