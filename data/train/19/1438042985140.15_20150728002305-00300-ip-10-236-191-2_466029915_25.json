There were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012 or 2011.\u00a0 Additional mandatory principal repayments totaling $1.8 million and $10.0\u00a0million will be due in 2012 and 2013 respectively with the remaining principal repayments due in 2014. The final mandatory term loan principal repayment will be due on November\u00a016, 2014, which is the maturity date for the term loan., 351675=The Company\u0092s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012 was 86.5% and 80.5% based on pretax income of $1.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively.\u00a0 Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012 is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of deferred tax assets associated with vested restricted stock units of $0.2 million and an increase to the valuation allowance of $0.6 million related to foreign tax credits.\u00a0 This compared to 425% and (19.1)% for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2011, respectively., 276538=The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September\u00a030, 2012 and for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u0093GAAP\u0094) for interim financial statements and pursuant to Form\u00a010-Q and Article\u00a010 of Regulation S-X.\u00a0 In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) have been made that are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of the Company as of September\u00a030, 2012, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011 and the cash flows for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011.\u00a0 The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December\u00a031, 2011 has been derived from the Company\u0092s audited consolidated financial statements.\u00a0 Operating results for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December\u00a031, 2012., 589089=Our 20 largest clients accounted for approximately 33% and 45% of revenues for the years ended December\u00a031, 2011 and 2010, respectively.\u00a0 In addition, our large clients generally maintain sizable receivable balances at any given time and our ability to collect such receivables could be jeopardized if such client fails to remain a viable business., 85868=Common stock, $.001 par value, 100,000 shares authorized; 36,675 shares issued and 36,103 shares outstanding at September\u00a030, 2012 and 36,675 shares issued and 36,276 outstanding at December\u00a031, 2011, 434958=The net decrease in revenues of $2.4 million in 2012 was attributable principally to a 22% decrease in Europe to $14.2 million and an 18% decrease in Asia Pacific revenues to $5.4 million.\u00a0 The decrease in revenues is primarily due to lower volumes in sourcing related engagements in Europe and Asia Pacific regions.\u00a0 These decreases were offset by a 12% increase in Americas primarily due to an increase in managed services revenue.\u00a0 The translation of foreign currency into US dollars also had a negative impact on performance compared to the prior year., 271572=Information Services Group,\u00a0Inc. (the \u0093Company\u0094) was incorporated in Delaware on July\u00a020, 2006. The Company was formed to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset or stock acquisition or other similar business combination one or more domestic or international operating businesses., 557079=Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012 was 80.5% compared to (19.1)% for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2011.\u00a0 Our effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of deferred tax assets associated with vested restricted stock units of $0.2 million and an increase in the valuation allowance of $0.6 million related to the foreign tax credits.\u00a0 Our\u00a0operations resulted in\u00a0a pre-tax\u00a0income of $2.3 million and a tax provision of $1.9 million at the 80.5% effective tax rate for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012., 487553=425% for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2011.\u00a0 Our effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of deferred tax assets associated with vested restricted stock units of $0.1 million and an increase in the valuation allowance of $0.6 million related to the foreign tax credits.\u00a0 Our\u00a0operations resulted in\u00a0pre-tax\u00a0income of $1.6 million and a tax provision of $1.4 million at the 86.5% effective tax rate for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012., 273478=On January\u00a04, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of Compass.\u00a0 Compass is an independent global provider of business and information technology benchmarking, performance improvement, data and analytics services.\u00a0 It was founded in 1980 and headquartered in the United Kingdom and has 180 employees in 16 countries serving nearly 250 clients worldwide.\u00a0 Compass uses benchmarking to support fact-based decision making, analysis to optimize cost reduction, and tools and techniques to manage business performance.\u00a0 For accounting purposes, the acquisition of Compass has been treated as a business combination., 28332=December\u00a031, 2011, 396805=As of September\u00a030, 2012, the total principal outstanding under the term loan facility was $58.6 million.

The final mandatory term loan principal repayment will be due on November\u00a016, 2014, which is the maturity date for the term loan., 532939=Total operating expenses decreased $2.3 million or 2% for the first nine months of 2012 with decreases in SG&A expenses (10%) offset by increases in direct expenses (6%).\u00a0 Lower costs were driven by lower travel, occupancy, conference, bad debt and marketing expenses.\u00a0 We did not record any restructuring or deal costs during the first nine months of 2012 compared to $3.1 million recorded in the first nine months of 2011.\u00a0 These cost decreases were partially offset by higher outside professional services, compensation and benefits, contract labor, and computer expenses.\u00a0 Lower SG&A levels were mostly driven by a $1.9 million reduction in the contingent liability related to the STA Consulting earn out based on latest estimates of future profit levels.\u00a0 The impact of foreign currency translation into US dollars also drove costs lower compared to the same prior 2011 period., 488694=The results for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2011 discussed below include the operations of Compass from January\u00a04, 2011 to September\u00a030, 2011 and STA Consulting from February\u00a010, 2011 to September\u00a030, 2011., 510570=The net increase in revenues of $3.4 million or 2% in 2012 was attributable principally to an 18% increase in Americas revenues to $77.9 million and a 10% increase in Asia Pacific revenues to $19.3 million.\u00a0 The increase in revenues is primarily due to higher levels of sourcing activity in Americas and Asia Pacific region, attributable to increases in managed services revenue.\u00a0 These increases were offset by an 18% reduction in Europe primarily due to lower volumes in sourcing related engagements.\u00a0 The translation of foreign currency into US dollars also negatively impacted performance compared to prior year., 488331=RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2011, 411570=On February\u00a010, 2011 ISG completed the acquisition of STA Consulting (Salvaggio, Teal\u00a0& Associates) an independent information technology advisor serving the public sector. STA Consulting advises clients on information technology strategic planning and the acquisition and implementation of new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and other enterprise administration and management systems., 596379=The risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for the fiscal year ended December\u00a031, 2011 have not materially changed., 9251=20-5261587, 27702=September\u00a030, \u00a02012, 629143=Date: \u00a0November\u00a0 9, 2012, 104589=2012, 563469=We incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness to finance the acquisition of TPI, including transaction costs and deferred underwriting fees. On November\u00a016, 2007, our wholly-owned subsidiary International Consulting Acquisition Corp. (\u0093ICAC\u0094) entered into a senior secured credit facility comprised of a $95.0 million term loan facility and a $10.0 million revolving credit facility. On November\u00a016, 2007,\u00a0ICAC borrowed $95.0\u00a0million under the term loan facility to finance the purchase price for our acquisition of TPI and to pay transaction costs. As a result of the substantial fixed costs associated with the debt obligations, we expect that:, 463916=We amortize our intangible assets (e.g. client relationships and databases) over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill related to acquisitions is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing. As of November\u00a01, 2011, trademark and trade names acquired in our acquisitions were reclassified from indefinite to definite lived assets and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives., 393672=On January\u00a04, 2011, as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Compass, we issued an aggregate of $6.3 million in convertible notes to Compass (the \u0093Notes\u0094).\u00a0 The Notes mature on January\u00a04, 2018 and interest is payable on the outstanding principal amount, computed daily, at the rate of 3.875%\u00a0 per annum on January\u00a031 of each calendar year and on the seventh anniversary of the date of the Notes.\u00a0 The Notes are subject to transfer restrictions until January\u00a031, 2013.\u00a0 If the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market exceeds $4 per share for 60 consecutive trading days (the \u0093Trigger Event\u0094), the holder of the Notes may convert all (but not less than all) of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes into shares of our common stock at the rate of 1 share for every $4 in principal amount outstanding.\u00a0 After the Trigger event, we may prepay all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes by giving the holder 30 days written notice., 486182=Our quarterly effective tax rate varies from period to period based on the mix of earnings among the various state and foreign tax jurisdictions in which business is conducted and the level of non-deductible expenses projected to be incurred during the current fiscal year.\u00a0 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012 was 86.5% compared to, 559278=As of September\u00a030, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents were $15.0\u00a0million, a net decrease of $9.5\u00a0million from December\u00a031, 2011, which was primarily attributable to the following:, 410893=On January\u00a04, 2011,\u00a0ISG completed the acquisition of Compass.\u00a0 Compass is an independent global provider of business and information technology benchmarking, performance improvement, data and analytics services.\u00a0 Compass uses benchmarking to support fact-based decision making, analysis to optimize cost reduction, and tools and techniques to manage business performance., 597999=The following table details the repurchases that were made during the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012., 277980=Certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted from these interim financial statements pursuant to the rules\u00a0and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u0093SEC\u0094).\u00a0 Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the fiscal year ended December\u00a031, 2011, which are included in the Company\u0092s 2011 Form\u00a010-K filed with the SEC., 570931=We are required to comply with a total leverage ratio as defined in the 2007 Credit Agreement. The total leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, subject to certain exclusions.\u00a0 The 2007 Credit Agreement includes quarterly financial covenants that require us to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in the 2007 Credit Agreement). As of September\u00a030, 2012, our maximum total leverage ratio was 3.00 to 1.00 and we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the 2007 Credit Agreement. The maximum total leverage ratio will continue to decline over the life of the 2007 Credit Agreement. The maximum total leverage ratio is 3.00 for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2012 and through the period ending December\u00a031, 2012 and will continue to decline thereafter. We currently expect to be in compliance with the covenants contained within the 2007 Credit Agreement. In the event we are unable to remain in compliance with the debt covenants associated with the 2007 Credit Agreement we have alternative options available to us including, but not limited to, the ability to make a prepayment on our debt without penalty to bring the actual leverage ratio into compliance. Our available cash balances and liquidity will be negatively impacted should such prepayment be necessary.\u00a0 In addition, should our revenues not meet our forecast, we have the ability to reduce various expenditures to minimize the impact to the leverage ratio. Such actions may include reductions to headcount, variable compensation, marketing expenses, conferences and non-billable travel., 354511=As of September\u00a030, 2012, the Company has recorded a liability of $2.8\u00a0million representing the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of STA Consulting, of which all is classified as noncurrent and included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. In the third quarter of 2012, the Company reduced the contingent consideration liability by $1.9 million based on the latest estimates of future profit levels due to increased competition in the public sector and increased pricing pressures.\u00a0 This reduction decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by $1.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss).\u00a0 The Company paid $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2012 and expects to pay the remaining contingent liability in the first quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.\u00a0 No payments are currently anticipated in 2013 or 2014 related to 2012 and 2013 performance., 292759=In September\u00a02011, the FASB amended the Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Topic of the ASC that allows us to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If, after assessing the relevant information, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than the carrying amount, no additional analysis is necessary. If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, then we are required to proceed to the quantitative approach. The amended guidance is effective for us in our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2012, and adoption is not expected to impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations., 622811=The following materials from ISG\u0092s Quarterly Report on Form\u00a010-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2012 formatted in XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language): (i)\u00a0Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, (ii)\u00a0the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets at September\u00a030, 2012 and December\u00a031, 2011, (iii)\u00a0Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, and (iv)\u00a0Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012. In accordance with Rule\u00a0406T of Regulation S-T, the XBRL related information in Exhibit\u00a0101 to this Quarterly Report on Form\u00a010-Q shall not be deemed to be \u0093filed\u0094 for purposes of Section\u00a018 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be part of any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing., 352578=As of September\u00a030, 2012, the Company had total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $2.3 million of which approximately $2.3 million of this benefit would impact the Company\u0092s effective tax rate if recognized.\u00a0 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax provision in its condensed consolidated statement of operations. \u00a0As of September\u00a030, 2012, the Company\u0092s accrual of interest and penalties were $0.4\u00a0 million., 388772=The 2007 Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, place restrictions on matters customarily restricted in senior secured credit facilities, including restrictions on indebtedness (including guarantee obligations), liens, fundamental changes, sales or disposition of property or assets, investments (including loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions), transaction with affiliates, dividends and other payments in respect of capital stock, optional payments and modifications of other material debt instruments, negative pledges and agreements restricting subsidiary distributions and changes in line of business. The 2007 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including cross-default to other material agreements, judgment default and change of control., 291675=In July\u00a02012, the FASB amended the Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Topic of the ASC that allows us to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the relevant information, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than the carrying amount, no additional analysis is necessary. If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, then we are required to proceed to the quantitative approach. The amended guidance is effective for us in our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2013, and adoption is not expected to impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations., 534122=Depreciation and amortization expense in the first nine months of 2012 and 2011 was $6.6 million and $8.4 million, respectively.\u00a0 The decrease of $1.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to decrease in amortization as a result of intangible assets that were fully amortized in 2011., 288022=The fair value of the Company\u0092s contingent consideration liability related to the STA acquisition was $2.8 million and $6.8 million at September\u00a030, 2012 and December\u00a031, 2011, respectively.\u00a0 In the third quarter of 2012, the Company reduced the contingent consideration liability by $1.9 million based on the latest estimates of future profit levels due to increased competition in the public sector and increased pricing pressures.\u00a0 The Company paid $2.0 million related to the contingent consideration during the second quarter of 2012 related to 2011 performance.\u00a0 The fair value measurement of this contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the Company\u0092s own assumptions in measuring fair values using the income approach.\u00a0 In developing these estimates, the Company considered certain performance projections, historical results, and industry trends.\u00a0 This amount was estimated through a valuation model that incorporated industry-based, probability-weighted assumptions related to the achievement of these milestones and thus the likelihood of us making payments. These cash outflow projections have been discounted using a rate of 2.3%, which is the after-tax cost of debt financing for market participants., 353681=The Company is subject to contingencies which arise through the ordinary course of business. \u00a0All liabilities of which management is aware are properly reflected in the financial statements at September\u00a030, 2012 and December\u00a031, 2011., 105291=2011, 3358=QUARTERLY REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION\u00a013 OR 15(d)\u00a0OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 286204=The Company held investments in cash equivalent money market funds of approximately $20 thousand and $1.1 million at September\u00a030, 2012 and December\u00a031, 2011, respectively. The Company considers the fair value of cash equivalent money market funds to be classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy., 402960=You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Except for historical information, the discussion in this report contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology, such as \u0093may,\u0094 \u0093should,\u0094 \u0093could,\u0094 \u0093predict,\u0094 \u0093potential,\u0094 \u0093continue,\u0094 \u0093expect,\u0094 \u0093anticipate,\u0094 \u0093future,\u0094 \u0093intend,\u0094 \u0093plan,\u0094 \u0093believe,\u0094 \u0093estimate,\u0094 \u0093forecast\u0094 and similar expressions (or the negative of such expressions.) Forward-looking statements include statements concerning 2012 revenue growth rates and capital expenditures. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions based on information currently available to us, including financial and operational information, the volatility of our stock price, and current competitive conditions. As a result, these statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of material risks and uncertainties that the Company faces, see the discussion in our 2011 Form\u00a010-K titled \u0093Risk Factors.\u0094, 383163=The Company has incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness to finance the acquisition of TPI, including transaction costs and deferred underwriting fees. On November\u00a016, 2007, our wholly-owned subsidiary International Consulting Acquisition Corp. (\u0093ICAC\u0094) entered into a senior secured credit facility comprised of a $95.0 million term loan facility and a $10.0 million revolving credit facility. On November\u00a016, 2007,\u00a0ICAC borrowed $95.0\u00a0million under the term loan facility to finance the purchase price for our acquisition of TPI and to pay transaction costs. As a result of the substantial fixed costs associated with the debt obligations, we expect that:, 579465=Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements. We prepare these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience, available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes or developments in our evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies that we believe to be Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates as disclosed in our Form\u00a010-K, for the year ended December\u00a031, 2011., 275646=During the fourth quarter of 2011, we merged our individual corporate brands into one globally integrated business under the ISG brand.\u00a0 We have retained our legacy brands to identify specific products and services we are known for including \u0093The TPI Index\u0094, \u0093TPI Sourcing\u0094 and \u0093Compass Benchmarks\u0094., 272165=On November\u00a016, 2007, we consummated the acquisition of TPI Advisory Services Americas,\u00a0Inc., a Texas corporation (\u0093TPI\u0094), pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated April\u00a024, 2007, as amended on September\u00a030, 2007, by and between MCP-TPI Holdings, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (\u0093MCP-TPI\u0094), and the Company.\u00a0 For accounting purposes, the TPI acquisition has been treated as a business combination.\u00a0 TPI operate as a fact-based sourcing advisory firm specializing in the assessment, evaluation, negotiation and management of service contracts between our clients and those clients\u0092 outside service providers and their internal shared service organizations. These service contracts typically involve the clients\u0092 information technology (\u0093IT\u0094) infrastructure or software applications development, data and voice communications, or IT-enabled business processes such as the clients\u0092 internal finance and accounting functions, human resources, call center operations, or supply chain procurement., 286808=The Company\u0092s financial instruments include outstanding borrowings of $64.8 million at September\u00a030, 2012 and $70.1 million at December\u00a031, 2011, which are carried at amortized cost.\u00a0 The fair values of these instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Company\u0092s outstanding borrowings is approximately $64.6 million and $67.1 million at September\u00a030, 2012 and December\u00a031, 2011, respectively.\u00a0 The fair values of these instruments have been estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company\u0092s incremental borrowing rate for similar borrowing arrangements.\u00a0 The incremental borrowing rate used to discount future cash flows ranged from 3.69% to 4.00%.\u00a0 The Company also considered recent transactions of peer group companies for similar instruments with comparable terms and maturities as well as an analysis of current market conditions., 590905=Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\u00a0 as amended (the \u0093Exchange Act\u0094) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules\u00a0and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September\u00a030, 2012, as required by the Rule\u00a013a-15(b)\u00a0under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company\u0092s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September\u00a030, 2012., 462843=Depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter of 2012 and 2011 was $2.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively.\u00a0 The decrease of $0.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to decrease in amortization as a result of intangible assets that were fully amortized in 2011. Our fixed assets consist of furniture, fixtures, equipment (mainly personal computers) and leasehold improvements. Depreciation expense is generally computed by applying the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets. We also capitalize some costs associated with the purchase and development of internal-use software, system conversions and website development costs. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software or system., 398439=During the third quarter of 2012, management determined that a triggering event had occurred due to a revision in forecasted earnings as a result of macro-economic environment in Europe and continued unfavorable currency translation.\u00a0 Accordingly, the Company evaluated the carrying value of goodwill., 394986=On March\u00a013, 2012, our lenders agreed to allow ICAC to include the results of operations of Compass in the calculation of our leverage ratio.\u00a0 ICAC also received approval to increase the annual cash dividend payable to ISG to $2.0 million., 6486=TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION\u00a013 OR 15(d)\u00a0OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 12122=Indicate by check mark whether the Registrant (1)\u00a0has filed all reports required to be filed by Section\u00a013 or 15(d)\u00a0of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the Registrant was required to file such reports), and (2)\u00a0has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days.\u00a0 Yes x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No o, 621236=Certification Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section\u00a01350, as Adopted Pursuant to Section\u00a0906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002., 389865=The Company is required to comply with a total leverage ratio as defined in the 2007 Credit Agreement. The total leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, subject to certain exclusions.\u00a0 The 2007 Credit Agreement includes quarterly financial covenants that require us to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in the 2007 Credit Agreement). As of September\u00a030, 2012, our maximum total leverage ratio was 3.00 to 1.00 and we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the 2007 Credit Agreement. The maximum total leverage ratio will continue to decline over the life of the 2007 Credit Agreement. The maximum total leverage ratio is 3.00 for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2012 and through the period ending December\u00a031, 2012 and will continue to decline thereafter. We currently expect to be in compliance with the covenants contained within the 2007 Credit Agreement. In the event we are unable to remain in compliance with the debt covenants associated with the 2007 Credit Agreement we have alternative options available to us including, but not limited to, the ability to make a prepayment on our debt without penalty to bring the actual leverage ratio into compliance. Our available cash balances and liquidity will be negatively impacted should such prepayment be necessary.\u00a0 In addition, should the Company\u0092s revenues not meet our forecast, the Company has the ability to reduce various expenditures to minimize the impact to the leverage ratio. Such actions may include reductions to headcount, variable compensation, marketing expenses, conferences and non-billable travel., 294163=Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The 250,000 STA shares were excluded from basic and diluted earnings per share since the contingency has not been met as of the reporting period.\u00a0 Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would share in the net income of the Company.\u00a0 For the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012, the effect of 5.0 million warrants, 0.3 million stock appreciation rights (\u0093SARs\u0094) have not been considered in the diluted earnings per share, since the market price of the stock was less than the exercise price during the period in the computation.\u00a0 In addition, 1.2 million restricted shares have not been considered in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012, as the effect would be anti-dilutive.\u00a0 For the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2011, the effect of 1.6 million shares related to the Company\u0092s convertible debt, 5.0 million warrants, 0.4 million SARs and 3.2 million restricted shares have not been considered in the diluted earnings per share calculation, as the effect would be anti-dilutive., 4546=For the quarterly period ended September\u00a030, 2012, 410529=RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2011, 586115=We operate in a number of international areas which exposes us to significant foreign currency exchange rate risk.\u00a0 We have significant international revenue, which is generally collected in local currency.\u00a0 As of September\u00a030, 2012, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for hedging or speculative purposes.\u00a0 The percentage of total revenues generated outside the Americas increased from 22% in 2004 to 53% in 2011.\u00a0 It is expected that our international revenues will continue to grow in the longer term as European, Asian and other markets adopt sourcing solutions.\u00a0 We recorded a foreign exchange transaction loss of $0.1 million for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2012.\u00a0 The translation of our revenues into U.S. dollars, as well as our costs of operating internationally, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition., 350238=On April\u00a01, 2012, the Company executed an agreement for the purchase of the entire business and assets of Compass Consulting Oy, previously a franchise incorporated in Finland which the Company had no ownership interest for approximately $0.1 million plus deferred consideration of $0.01 million plus 50% of the amount by which the relevant profit exceeds targeted profit for the twelve month period ended March\u00a031, 2012. The targeted profit for the twelve month period ended March\u00a031, 2012 was not achieved.\u00a0 This transaction has been accounted for as a business combination and the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.\u00a0 There was no goodwill recorded as a part of this business combination.}",
