    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6019=After acquiring the correct motion prediction block from the down-sampled image, upsampling is used to get the corresponding prediction block in the high resolution picture. Consequently, subpixel accuracy in motion block prediction is desirable in the down sampled picture. For example, using 3:1 decimation, it is desirable to have 1/3 (or 1/6) subpixel accuracy in the down-converted picture for proper motion prediction. The subpixel which is a first pixel required by the motion vector, in addition to the down-sampled motion block, is determined. Then, subsequent subpixel positions are determined using modulo arithmetic as described in the following. The subpixel positions are denoted as xs as given in equation (3): X s = ( XH 2 ) \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e % \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e ( Dx ) ( 3 )}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{53888=FIG. 6B is a pixel block diagram which shows the input and decimated output pixels for 4:2:0 video signal using 2:1 decimation., 292976=FIGS. 11B through 11D relate the output modes provided by Display section 173 shown in FIG. 11A of the Video Decoder 121 to the active blocks of FIG. 1A. FIG. 11B illustrates a 27 MHz Dual output mode which, for which the video data is 525P or 525I, first processor 1101 (shown in FIG. 1A) provides 525P video data to 27 MHz DAC 143 as well as 525I data (601 Data Out) to NTSC Encoder 152. FIG. 11C illustrates that in 27 MHz single output mode, only 525I data (601 Data Out) is provided to NTSC encoder 152. FIG. 11D illustrates a 74 MHz/27 MHz mode in which the output mode matches the input format and the video data is provided to either the 27 MHz DAC 143 or 74 MHz DAC 141 depending on the output format. The 74 MHz DAC is used for 1920\ufffd1088 and 1280\ufffd720 pictures; the 27 MHz DAC is used for all other output formats., 232285=1. 1920H by 1080V interlace to 640 by 1080 interlace conversion (Horizontal 3:1 decimation)., 292362=Raster Generation and Control processor 1130 also receives the pixel clock and includes counters (not shown) which generate the raster space, allowing control commands to be sent on a line by line basis to Display Control Processor 1140. Display Control processor 1140 coordinates timing with the external memory 130 and starts the processing for each processing chain 1101 and 1102 on a line by line basis synchronized with the raster lines. Processor 1130 also generates the horizontal, vertical and field synchronization signals (H, V and F)., 291255=For the first set of processing elements 1101, MUX 1120 may select from mixed output video data, HD data provided on HD bypass 1122, or data from background insertion block 1110. The selected data is provided to output control processor 1126 which also receives the pixel clock. Output control processor 1126 then changes the data clock rate from the internal processing domain to the pixel clock rate according to the output mode desired., 107549=For example, the ranges of xs are 0, 1, 2 for 3:1 upsampling and 0, 1 for 2:1 upsampling. FIG. 3A shows subpixel positions and corresponding 17 predicted pixels for the 3:1 and 2:1 examples, and Table 3 gives the legend for FIG. 3A., 103107=The reference image data is added to output data provided by the IDCT processor 218. Since the output values of the summing network 230 correspond to an image having a number of pixels consistent with a high resolution format, these values may be downsampled for display on a display having a lower resolution. Downsampling in the Down Sampling processor 232 is substantially equivalent to subsampling of an image frame, but adjustments may be made based upon the conversion ratio. For example, in the case of 3:1 downsampling, the number of horizontally downsampled pixels are 6 or 5 for each input macroblock, and the first downsampled pixels are not always first pixel in the input macroblock., 132873=Filter coefficients are desirably reversed because the multiplication ordering is opposite to the normal ordering of filter coefficients, and it may be desirable to zero some coefficients. Table 7B gives exemplary coefficients for the 3:1 upsampling filter, and Table 7C gives exemplary coefficients for the 2:1 upsampling filter:, 279702=Down sampling is accomplished by the Down Sampling process 232 of FIG. 2B to reduce the number of pixels in the downconverted image. FIG. 6A shows the input and decimated output pixels for a 4:2:0 signal format for 3:1 decimation. FIG. 6B shows the input and decimated output pixels for 4:2:0 chrominance type 2:1 decimation. Table 11 gives the legend identification for the Luminance and Chrominance pixels of FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B. The pixel positions before and after the down conversion of FIGS. 6A and 6B are the interlaced (3:1 decimation) and progressive (2:1 decimation) cases respectively., 145880=For chrominance values of the exemplary implementation, XH is scaled by two and equations (1),(2) and (3\u2032) are applied. In one embodiment, phase and half pixel information (coded as two bits and one bit, respectively) is used by motion compensation processor 220 and half-pixel generator 228 of FIG. 2B. For example, reference block pixels are provided as U pixels first, V pixels next, and finally Y pixels. U and V pixels are clocked in for 40 cycles and Y pixels are clocked in for 144 cycles. Reference blocks may be provided for 3:1 decimation by providing the first five pixels, repeating twice, shifting the data by one, and repeating until a row is finished. The same method may be used for 2:1 decimation except that it is repeated once rather than twice. Input pixels are repeated since decimation follows addition of the output from motion compensation and half-pixel generation with the residual value. Consequently, for 3:1 decimation, two of three pixels are deleted, and dummy pixels for these pixel values do not matter., 55393=FIG. 9C is a graph which shows a second ratio profile for mapping a 4:3 picture onto a 16:9 display., 232397=2. 1280H by 720V progressive to 640 by 720 progressive conversion (Horizontal 2:1 Decimation), 123760=In a fixed point representation, the numbers in parenthesis of Table 5 and Table 6 are 2's complement representations in 9 bits with the corresponding double precision numbers are on the left. Depending upon the subpixel position of the motion prediction block in the downsampled reference image frame, one corresponding phase of the polyphase interpolation filter is used. Also, for the exemplary embodiment additional pixels on the left and right are used to interpolate 17 horizontal pixels in the original image frame. For example, in the case of 3:1 decimation, a maximum of 6 horizontally downsampled pixels are produced for each input macroblock. However, when upsampling, 9 horizontal pixels are used to produce the corresponding motion prediction block values because an upsampling filter requires more left and right pixels outside of the boundary for the filter to operate. Since the exemplary embodiment employs half pixel motion estimation, 17 pixels are needed to get 16 half pixels which are the average values of nearest two pixel samples. A half pixel interpolator performs the interpolation operation which provides the block of pixels with half-pixel resolution. Table 7A illustrates an exemplary mapping between subpixel positions and polyphase filter elements, and shows a number of left pixels which are needed in addition to the pixels in the upsampled block for the upsampling process., 53742=FIG. 6A is a macroblock diagram which shows the input and decimated output pixels for 4:2:0 video signal using 3:1 decimation., 256832=As described with reference to equation (12\u2032), only coefficients in the transform domain are provided to the processing algorithms; and the operations are linear which allows mathematical operations on these coefficients only. The operations for the IDCT, as is readily apparent from equation (12\u2032), form a sum of products. Consequently, a hardware implementation requires known coefficients to be stored in memory, such as a ROM (not shown), and a group of multiply and add circuits (not shown) which receives these coefficients from the ROM as well as selected coefficients from the matrix of input transform coordinates. For more advanced systems, a ROM-accumulator method may be used if the order of mathematical operations is modified according to distributed arithmetic to convert from a sum of products implementation to a bit-serial implementation. Such techniques are described in, for example, Stanley A. White, Applications of Distributed Arithmetic to Digital Signal Processing: A Tutorial Review, IEEE ASSP Magazine, July, 1989, which take advantage of symmetries in the computations to reduce a total gate count of the sum of products implementation., 129799=FIG. 3B summarizes the upsampling process which is performed for each row of an input macroblock. First, in step 310, the motion vector for the block of the input image frame being processed is received. At step 312, the motion vector is translated to correspond to the downsampled reference frame in memory. At step 314, the scaled motion vector is used to calculate the coordinates of the desired reference image half macroblock stored in memory 130. At step 316 the subpixel point for the half macroblock is determined and the initial polyphase filter values for upsampling are then determined at step 318. The identified pixels for the reference half macroblock of the stored downsampled reference frame are then retrieved from memory 130 at step 320. Before the first pass at the filtering step 324, the registers of the filter may be initialized at step 322, which, for the exemplary embodiment includes the step of loading the registers with the initial 3 or 5 pixel values. Then, after the filtering step 324, the process determines, at step 326, whether all pixels have been processed, which for the exemplary embodiment is 17 pixels. If all pixels have been processed, the upsampled block is complete. For an exemplary embodiment, a 17 by 9 pixel half macroblock is returned. The system returns upper or lower half macroblocks to allow for motion prediction decoding of both progressive scan and interlaced scan images. If all pixels have not been processed, the phase is updated at step 328, and the phase is checked, for the 0 value. If the phase is zero, the registers are updated for the next set of pixel values. Updating the phase at step 328 updates the phase value to 0, 1, and 2 for the filter loop period for exemplary 3:1 upsampling and to 0, and 1 for the filter loop period for 2:1 upsampling. Where the left-most pixel is outside of a boundary of the image picture, the first pixel value in the image picture may be repeated., 282486=For down sampling of the interlaced image, which may be the conversion from a 1920 by 1080 pixel image to a 640 by 1080 pixel horizontally compressed image, two out of every three pixels are decimated on the horizontal axis. For the exemplary 3:1 decimation, there are three different macroblock types after the down conversion process. In FIG. 6A, original macroblocks were denoted by MB0, MB1, MB2. The down sampled luminance pixels in MB0 start at the first pixel in the original macroblock, but in MB1 and MB2 the down-sampled pixels start at the third and the second pixels. Also the number of down-sampled pixels in each macroblock are not the same. In MB0, there are 6 down-sampled pixels horizontally, but 5 pixels in MB1 and MB2. These three MB types are repeating, therefore Modulo 3 arithmetic is to be applied. Table 12 summarizes the number of downsampling pixels and offsets for each input macroblock MB0, MB1,, 231163=The cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter is determined by the decimation ratio. For one exemplary embodiment, the cutoff frequency is \u03c0/3 for a 3:1 decimation and \u03c0/2 for a 2:1 decimation, where \u03c0 corresponds to one-half of sampling frequency., 295350=FIG. 7A is a high level block diagram illustrating an exemplary filter suitable for use as the VPF 282 of one embodiment of the present invention. In the following, the VPF 282 is described as processing pairs of input pixels (each pair includes two luminance pixels, Y, pixel and a chrominance CR or CB, pixel) to produce a pair of output pixels. This facilitates processing of the 4:2:0 format because color pixels may be easily associated with their corresponding luminance pixels. One skilled in the art, however, would realize that only luminance pixels or only chrominance pixels may be so processed. In addition, the VPF 282 as described produces lines in progressive format. In another embodiment employing a dual output and supporting both a main output channel and a secondary output channel, a second VPF 282 may be added., 340735=FIGS. 9B and 9C show ratio profiles for mapping a 4:3 picture onto a 16:9 display. The ratios are defined in terms of input value to output value, so 4/3 is downsampling by 4 to 3 and 1/3 is up sampling 1 to 3. The ratio profiles shown in FIGS. 9B and 9C map an input picture image having 720 active pixels to a display having 720 active pixels. For example, in FIG. 9B mapping a 4:3 aspect ratio display to a 16\ufffd9 aspect ratio display uses a 4/3 downsampling, but to fill all the samples of the display requires a 1/1 average across the horizontal line. Consequently, the profile of FIG. 9B has the correct aspect ratio in the center between display pixels 240 and 480, while the values at the sides are upsampled to fill the display. FIGS. 9D and 9E illustrate the profiles used for resizing from a 16\ufffd9 display image to a 4:3 display which is the inverse of the profiles shown in FIGS. 9B and 9C., 97477=FIG. 2C illustrates the operation of the system in DC mode, converting an 1125I signal to 525P/525I format. In this scenario, after low pass filtering by DCT filter 216 as described above with reference to FIG. 2B, the system down samples the high resolution signal by a factor of 3, and stores the pictures in the 48 Mb memory as 640H and 1080 V, interlaced. For this system, the motion compensation process upsamples the stored pictures by a factor of 3 (as well as translation of the received motion vectors) before motion-predictive decoding is accomplished. Also, the picture is filtered horizontally and vertically for display conversion., 55513=FIG. 9D is a graph which shows a first ratio profile for mapping a 16:9 picture onto a 4:3 display., 302770=Horizontal resampling is accomplished by employing an 8 tap, 8 phase polyphase filter. Generation of display pixels is coordinated by the HZPF Controller 802 by tracking the integer and fractional parts of the horizontal position in the decoded and downsampled picture. The integer part indicates which pixels are to be accessed and the fractional part indicates which filter phase should be used. Using modulo N arithmetic when calculating the fractional part may allow for less than 8 phases to be used. For example, this may be useful if an exact downsampling ratio such as 9 to 5 is used. If the down-sampling ratio cannot be expressed as a simple fraction, the fractional part is truncated to one of the N phases. The HZPF 284 of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention filters pixel pairs, and uses alignment on even pixel boundaries to facilitate processing of the 4:2:0 formatted picture and to keep the CR and CB pixels (the color pixels) together with the corresponding Y pixels., 267737=For DC mode, 1920\ufffd1080 pictures are reduced by a factor of 3 horizontally, yielding a 640\ufffd1080 picture; 1280\ufffd720 pictures are reduced by a factor of 2 horizontally yielding a 640\ufffd720 picture. The 704\ufffd480 and 640\ufffd480 pictures are not required to be reduced in DC mode., 287847=Referring to FIG. 11A, two output video signals are supported, a first output signal VIDout1 which supports any selected video format, and a second output signal VIDout2 which supports 525I (CCIR-601) only. Each output signal is processed by separate sets of display processing elements 1101 and 1102, respectively, which perform horizontal and vertical upsampling/downsampling. This configuration may be preferred when the display aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of the input picture. An optional On Screen Display (OSD) section 1104 may be included to provide on screen display information to one of the supported output signals VIDout1 and VIDout2 to form display signals Vout1 or Vout2. All processing is performed at the internal clock rate except for control of the output signals Vout1 or Vout2 at Output Controllers 1126 and 1128, which is done at the pixel clock rate. For the preferred embodiment, the pixel clock rate may be at the luminance pixel rate or at twice the luminance pixel rate., 290284=As would be known to one skilled in the art, the elements of the display section 173 are controlled by a controller 1150, which is set up by parameters read from and written to the microprocessor interface. The controller generates signal CNTRL, and such control is necessary to coordinate and to effect proper circuit operation, loading and transfer of pixels, and signal processing., 290702=Data from the horizontal processing block 284, data from a second horizontal processing block 284 a, and HD (non processed) Video data on HD Bypass 1122 are provided to Multiplexer 118 which selects, under processor control (not shown), one video data stream which is provided to mixer 116 to combine the video data stream and optional OSD data from OSD processor 1104 into mixed output video data. The mixed video output data is then provided to MUXs 1120 and 1124., 289004=Because the display sets of processing elements 1101 and 1102 operate similarly, only the operation of the display processing set 1101 is described. Referring to the display processing set 1101, four lines of pixel data are provided from the memory 130 (shown in FIG. 1A) to the vertical processing block 282 (shown in FIG. 2B) in raster order. Each line supplies CR,Y,CB,Y data 32 bits at a time. Vertical Processing block 282 then filters the four lines down to one line and provides the filtered data in 32 bit CRYCBY format to horizontal processing block 284 (also shown in FIG. 2B). The horizontal processing block 284 provides the correct number of pixels for the selected raster format as formatted pixel data. Consequently, the filtered data rate entering the horizontal processing block 284 is not necessarily equal to the output data rate. In an upsampling case, the input data rate will be lower than the output data rate. In a down sampling case, the input data rate will be higher than the output data rate. The formatted pixel data may have background information inserted by optional background processing block 1110., 291756=For the second processing elements 1102, MUX 1124 may select from mixed output video data or data from background insertion block 1110 a. The selected data is provided to output control processor 1128 which also receives the pixel clock. Output control processor 1128 then changes the data clock rate from the internal processing domain to the pixel clock rate according to the output mode desired. MUX 1132 provides either the received selected data (601 Data Out) of MUX 1124 or optional OSD data from OSD processor 1104., 276619=Referring to FIG. 1B, the Memory Subsystem 174 may provide internal picture data interfaces to the Macroblock decoder 172 and display section 173. A decoded macroblock interface accepts decoded macroblock data and stores it in correct memory address locations of Memory 130 according to a memory map defined for the given format. Memory addresses may be derived from the macroblock number and picture number. The macroblocks may be received as a macroblock row on three channels, one channel per 16 Mb memory device (131-136 of FIG. 1A) at the system clock rate. Each memory device may have two partitions for each picture, each partition using an upper and lower address. For interlaced pictures, the one partition carries Field 0 data and the other partition carries Field 1 data, and for progressive pictures, both upper and lower partitions are treated as a single partition and carry data for the entire frame. Every macroblock is decoded and stored for every picture, except for 3:2 pull down mode where decoding is paused for an entire field time period. In 3:2 pulldown mode, a signal having a frame rate of 24 frames per second is displayed at 60 frames (or fields) per second by displaying one frame twice and the next frame three times., 55274=FIG. 9B is a graph which shows a first ratio profile for mapping a 4:3 picture onto a 16:9 display., 113759=Next two tables, Table 5 and Table 6, show polyphase filter coefficients for the exemplary 3:1 and 2:1 upsampling polyphase filters., 64307=The optional computer interface 110 transmits and receives computer image signals which conform, for example, to the IEEE 1394 standard. The computer interface 110 includes a physical layer processor 111 and link layer processor 112. The physical layer processor 111 converts electrical signals from output port 113 into received computer generated image information and control signals, and provides these signals, for decoding by the link layer processor 112 into IEEE 1394 formatted data. The physical layer processor 111 also converts received control signals encoded by the link layer processor 112 originating from the transport decoder 102 into electrical output signals according to the IEEE 1394 standard., 55632=FIG. 9E is a graph which shows a second ratio profile for mapping a 16:9 picture onto a 4:3 display., 52928=FIG. 3A is a pixel chart which illustrates subpixel positions and corresponding predicted pixels for the 3:1 and 2:1 exemplary embodiments of the present invention., 42640=This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/040,517 filed Mar. 12, 1997 and is a continuation-in-part of prior application Ser. No. 593,672, filed Jan. 29, 1996, U.S. Pat. No. 5,737,019., 268024=Accommodating multiple DC pictures in Memory 130 also requires supporting respective decoding operations according to corresponding picture display timing. For example, progressive pictures occur at twice the rate of interlaced pictures (60 or 59.94 Hz progressive vs. 30 or 29.97 Hz interlace) and, as a result, progressive pictures are decoded faster than interlaced pictures (60 or 59.94 Frames per second progressive vs. 30 or 29.97 Frames per second interlace). Consequently, the decoding rate is constrained by the display rate for the format, and if the less stringent 59.97 or 29.97 frames per second decoding rates are used rather than the 60 or 30 frames per second, one frame out of every 1001 frames may be dropped from the conversion. For convenience, decoding operations for a format may be measured in units of \u201cMacroblock Time\u201d (MblkT) defined as the period during which all decoding operations for a macroblock may be completed (clock cycles per macroblock decoding). Using this period as a measure, as defined in equation 14, control signals and memory access operations can be defined during the regularly occurring MblkT period., 60319=Referring to FIG. 1A, the exemplary system includes a front end interface 100, having a transport decoder and processor 102 with associated memory 103. Also included may be an optional multiplexer 101 for selecting received control information and computer generated images from the computer interface 110 at, for example, the IEEE 1394 link layer protocol or for recovering an encoded transport stream from a digital television tuner (not shown). The transport decoder 102 converts the received compressed data bit stream from the communication channel bit stream into compressed video data, which may be, for example, packetized elementary streams (PES) packets according to MPEG-2 standard. The transport decoder may provide either the PES packets directly, or may further convert the PES packets into one or more elementary streams.}",

Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the appended claims cover all such variations as fall within the scope of the invention. It is contemplated that a multi-sync monitor, which is capable of displaying video signals having several different display formats may be connected to the primary output port of the video decoder. In this instance, the video resolution component of the display type information recovered by the control processor 207 desirably includes an indication that the display is a multi-sync device so that the only format conversion that occurs is the aspect ratio adaptation shown in FIGS. 9A through 9E and FIG. 10, when the aspect ratio of the received video signal does not match that of the display device. As a final alternative, the system may be configured to sense information provided by the display device in order to determine the display format. For example, a two-way data path may be provided via one of the output signal lines (Y, CR, CB) of the decoder system by which data in a digital register in the display device may be read. The data in this register may indicate a manufacturer",
