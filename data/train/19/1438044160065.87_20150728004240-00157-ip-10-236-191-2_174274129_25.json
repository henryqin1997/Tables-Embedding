Jonathan Marks take away the New Trial and Judgment of Acquittal Motions and they both didn't state way these 2 Motions should be withdrawn a blatant sabotage from Judge Royal to clean the errors of the court and the prosecution read this court transcript on page 22 you will see defense attorney Jonathan Marks say when the judge asked do he have anything further an Mr. Marks said NO \u00a0now here comes the cleaning up the errors of the judges and the prosecution with the sabotage of the Judgment For Acquittal, we want you to pay close attention to judge Royal introducing this sabotage of this motion, for one he acts like he didn't know who filed the motion and what was the status of the motion, then the prosecutor Mr. Moultrie cleared it up and said the motion was filed by Adrian Patrick, if the judge didn't know the status of the motion which is right in front of him and he didn't hear no arguments on the motion why play the mind game he knew, that's why he introduce it on the record. Let's continue on page 23 the prosecutor Mr. Moultrie add in on the sabotage when he said that he BELIEVE that both of the motions that attorney Adrian Patrick filed which were ( Motion for new Trial and Motion for judgment of Acquittal) were withdrawn by Mr. Marks again Mr. Moultrie say I BELIEVE what is this courtroom setup for? with all these I think so-s where is the facts, we will tell you in one word (suppressed) by the judges. This hearing was suppose to be about a New Trial Motion that Mr. Marks filed because of New Evidence ( a recanting witness Ms. Abigail Washington lead witness for the government came forth to tell the truth and that was she lied at trial and so did the other alleged victims) not to withdraw Trial Error Motions this hearing had nothing to do with the errors the court and prosecution made at the trial. Judge Royal introduced this sabotage in this post-trial hearing to help keep the Chief of the Yamassee locked up with these lies, we want you to notice that Mr. Marks didn't officially take back the motion for judgment of acquittal he just answered the judge on line 7 is a typo or it was done deliberately by court stenographer after the Yes Sir, the judge ask Mr. Marks ( did you hear what I said?) There's a motion for judgment of acquittal that apparently was filed by Mr. Patrick. I know you withdraw his motion for new trial. I ASS U Me (QUES: WHY IS THE JUDGE ASSUMING A MAN LIFE IS ON THE LINE HERE?) that you're withdrawing that one too, but I mean I'm--. Mr. Marks then answer the judge yes Sir, what for? (did you hear what I said? or withdrawing the judgment of acquittal motion) this is not the proper way to withdraw a motion on the record (yes Sir) the judge withdrew the motion himself. A judge suppose to be there to help protect the Constitutional Rights of the accused not aid in illegally withdrawing motions so the accused can't win on appeal we see your action C.

This indigenous tribal leader was sentence to 135 years on only hearsay allegations of sexual abuse. Started by the hate filled and racist sheriff Sills, who aligned himself with over 300 to 400 hundred heavily armed federal and state agents and deputies.
