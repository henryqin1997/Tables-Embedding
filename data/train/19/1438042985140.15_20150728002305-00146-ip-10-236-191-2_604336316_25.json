            "Sanborn Map Company performed: 1. Pre and post-flight sensor calibration tests 2. Data collection 3. Data accuracy validation 4. Final Lidar processing For detailed information regarding Sanborn's lidar processing steps please see the Lidar Report in the Supplemental_Information section above for a detailed accuracy report.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received topographic files in .las V1.1 format. The files contained lidar elevation measurments, intensity measurements, classification information, flightline information and return information. The data were received in Massachusetts State Plane Mainland Zone 2001, NAD83 coordinates and were vertically referenced to NAVD88 using the Geoid03 model. The vertical units of the data were feet. CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The topographic las files were converted from las V1.1 to las V1.2. 2. The topographic las files' GPS Week Time was converted to Adjusted Standard GPS Time. 3. The topographic las files were converted from orthometric (NAVD88) heights to ellipsoidal heights using Geoid03. 4. The topographic las files were converted from a Projected Coordinate System (MA SP Mainland) to a Geographic Coordinate System (NAD83). 5. The topographic las files' vertical units were converted from feet to meters. 6. The topographic las files' horizontal units were converted from feet to decimal degrees. 7. The data were converted to LAZ format.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
