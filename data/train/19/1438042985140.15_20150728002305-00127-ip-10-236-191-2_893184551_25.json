The food I have had is about the same as fast food quality; not so nutritious but pleasant to the tastebuds. Along with the longer wait during 1130-130 the lunch room is also more crowded. The chairs are regular plastic chairs unless you are lucky enough to catch a seat in the few sofas that surround a T.V. Some chairs sit higher up so the view outside into the campus's pond and wildlife (squirrels, geese, etc.) is visible., 59742=I have not gone to school there yet. i start in august., 60773=I have not gone to school there yet. i start in august., 61260=I have not gone to school there yet. i start in august., 60088=I have not gone to school there yet. i start in august., 61022=I have not gone to school there yet. i start in august., 60428=I have not gone to school there yet. i start in august., 59394=I have not gone to school there yet. i start in august., 59044=I have not gone to school there yet. i start in august., 22689=Living on campus is pricey, but worth it!! The book are expensive (but that is everywhere! Unless you know how to work the system), but I'm only spending about $12000 a year, including all other expenses. It may seem like a ton of money, but compared to surrounding colleges this is nothing!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck I am from Hillview (Bullitt County, KY) and I still pay the in-state tuition charge for IN! It's a great value and a whole lot cheaper than the Louisville schools. It takes about 25 minutes to get to class, and parking isn't too bad if you hit it just right. Am enjoying being here I have been generally accepted by all - teachers, classmates, school staff. I am a 42 yr old returning student and fit in just like I was 22. Am learning a lot I have been challenged by the teachers and professors. The classes are very interesting and a lot more fun than 15 yrs ago!!
