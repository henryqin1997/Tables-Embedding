The technologies included are Electroluminescent (EL) lighting, LEDs, Fiber Optic, Array LEDs with Edge lit LED Lightguides, and Cold Cathode Fluorescent (CCFL) backlights. For each technology Circut Ideas: LED driver lights three LED strings and provides constant voltage supply Typical uses today include backlighting for LCD TVs, projectors, computer displays, camera flashes, and vehicle brake lights. All need constant-current LED drivers that are economical and offer high dimming ratio, high efficiency, and precise adjustable current. To save space, some LED drivers Medical Device Link . Why Choose Color Displays? Michael Wiklund and William Dolan extended the functionality of these devices over the past decade, enabling physicians to develop entirely new therapy regimes.
