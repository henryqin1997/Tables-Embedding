    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{115733=On July 2, 2013, the FAA published a final rule (78 FR 39576) amending the airplane operating regulations to include certain provisions of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 that affect jet airplanes with a maximum weight of 75,000 pounds or less operating in the United States. We solicited public comment on the final rule even though the FAA is not authorized to change the statutorily mandated prohibition. This action responds to the public comment the FAA received., 68957=This action provides interested persons with the opportunity to comment on the FAA's interpretation of the special rule for model aircraft established by Congress in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. In this interpretation, the FAA clarifies that: Model aircraft must satisfy the criteria in the Act to qualify as model aircraft and to be exempt from future FAA rulemaking action; and consistent with the Act, if a model aircraft operator endangers the safety of the National Airspace System, the FAA has the authority to take enforcement action against those operators for those safety violations., 110954=On February 22, 2013 the FAA published and requested public comment on the proposed privacy requirements (the \u201cDraft Privacy Requirements\u201d) for UAS test sites (the \u201cTest Sites\u201d) that the FAA will establish pursuant to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (\u201cFMRA\u201d). This document responds to the public comments received and publishes the FAA's final privacy requirements for the Test Sites (the \u201cFinal Privacy Requirements\u201d)., 151522=61 Stat. 1180, 151924=Title 14 published on 2015-01-01, 106271=On December 31, 2012, the FAA published a final rule with a request for comments amending the operating regulations for flight data recorders by correcting errors in recording rates in three different appendices. These errors created requirements that could not be met by certain airplanes without extensive modification, which was not intended when the requirements were adopted. The corrected recording rates are as intended when the applicable flight data recorder parameter requirements were adopted, but which had been omitted from the then current publication of the regulatory text., 89592=The FAA is correcting a final rule published on March 21, 2014. In that final rule, the FAA amended its regulations to extend the prohibition against certain flights within the Tripoli Flight Information Region from March 21, 2014 to March 21, 2015. The FAA inadvertently cited an incorrect RIN number. This document corrects that error and also corrects an inadvertent amendment., 60088=The FAA is extending the comment period on its Interpretation of the Special Rule for Model Aircraft that was published on June 25, 2014., 24709=The FAA is correcting a final rule technical amendment published on February 9, 2015 (80 FR 6899). In that final rule, which became effective on the date of publication, the FAA corrected errors in regulatory provisions addressing Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out equipment and use. The FAA inadvertently listed an incorrect Amendment Number for that final rule. This document corrects that error., 19004=This action extends the prohibition of flight operations within the Tripoli (HLLL) Flight Information Region (FIR) by all: U.S. air carriers; U.S. commercial operators; persons exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, except when such persons are operating a U.S.-registered aircraft for a foreign air carrier; and operators of U.S.-registered civil aircraft, except operators of such aircraft that are foreign air carriers. The extension of the expiration date is necessary to address a potential hazard to persons and aircraft engaged in such flight operations. Additionally, the FAA is amending the prohibition to make clear that operations by sub-contractors under a U.S. Government department, agency, or instrumentality's contract, grant, or cooperative agreement may be included in an approval request and to remove an obsolete reference to paragraph 8 of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1973. The FAA is also revising the approval conditions that will apply to operations authorized by other U.S. Government departments, agencies, and instrumentalities that are approved by the FAA, and the information about requests for exemption, to reflect the termination of statutory authorization for the FAA premium war risk insurance program., 147776=\u00a7 1155 - Aviation penalties, 130271=This rulemaking amends the airplane operating regulations to include certain provisions of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 that affect jet airplanes with a maximum weight of 75,000 pounds or less operating in the United States. The law provides that after December 31, 2015, such airplanes will not be allowed to operate in the contiguous United States unless they meet Stage 3 noise levels. This final rule incorporates that prohibition and describes the circumstances under which an otherwise prohibited airplane may be operated., 64581=The FAA is correcting a final rule published on February 21, 2014. In that rule, the FAA amended its regulations to revise the helicopter air ambulance, commercial helicopter, and general aviation helicopter operating requirements. This document corrects errors in the codified text of that document., 8286=This action amends Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 77, \u201cProhibition Against Certain Flights Within the Territory and Airspace of Iraq,\u201d which prohibits certain flight operations in the territory and airspace of Iraq by all United States (U.S.) air carriers; U.S. commercial operators; persons exercising the privileges of a U.S. airman certificate, except when such persons are operating a U.S.-registered civil aircraft for a foreign air carrier; and operators of U.S.-registered civil aircraft, except when such operators are foreign air carriers. On August 8, 2014, the FAA issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) prohibiting flight operations in the ORBB FIR at all altitudes, subject to certain limited exceptions, due to the armed conflict in Iraq. This amendment to SFAR No. 77 incorporates the flight prohibition set forth in the August 8, 2014, NOTAM into the rule. The FAA is also revising the approval process for this SFAR for other U.S. Government departments, agencies, and instrumentalities, to align with the approval process established for other recently published flight prohibition SFARs. This final rule will remain in effect for two years., 44589=This action prohibits certain flight operations in the Damascus (OSTT) Flight Information Region (FIR) by all U.S. air carriers; U.S. commercial operators; persons exercising the privileges of a U.S. airman certificate, except when such persons are operating a U.S.-registered aircraft for a foreign air carrier; and operators of U.S.-registered civil aircraft, except when such operators are foreign air carriers. The FAA previously prohibited such flight operations in a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) 4/4936, which was issued on August 18, 2014, and absent this rule, would have remained in effect until December 31, 2014. This Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) adopts the prohibitions currently in effect via the NOTAM, and requires compliance with the prohibitions for 2 years from the date of publication of this final rule, unless the FAA determines that it is necessary to amend or rescind this rule based on the situation in the region. The FAA finds that this action is necessary to address a potential hazard to persons and aircraft engaged in such flight operations., 84089=The FAA is delaying the effective date of the Helicopter Air Ambulance, Commercial Helicopter, and Part 91 Helicopter Operations final rule published on February 21, 2014. In that rule, the FAA amended its regulations to revise the helicopter air ambulance, commercial helicopter, and general aviation helicopter operating requirements. The April 22, 2014 effective date does not provide an adequate amount of time for the affected certificate holders to implement the new requirements. By extending the effective date to April 22, 2015, the affected certificate holders will have sufficient time to implement the new requirements. This action will only affect the effective date of the provisions of the rule scheduled to take effect April 22, 2014. Other provisions in the rule with specified compliance dates will not be affected., 33942=The FAA is correcting a final rule published on May 28, 2010. In that rule, the FAA amended its regulations by adding equipage requirements and performance standards for Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2014Broadcast (ADS-B) Out avionics on aircraft operating in Classes A, B, and C airspace, as well as other specified classes of airspace within the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). This document corrects errors in regulatory provisions addressing ADS-B Out equipment and use.}",
