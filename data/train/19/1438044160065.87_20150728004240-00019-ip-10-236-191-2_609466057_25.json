            "Applanix software was used in the post processing of the airborne GPS and inertial data that is critical to the positioning and orientation of the sensor during all flights. POSPac MMS provides the smoothed best estimate of trajectory (SBET) that is necessary for Optech's post processor to develop the point cloud from the LiDAR missions. The point cloud is the mathematical three dimensional collection of all returns from all laser pulses as determined from the aerial mission. At this point this data is ready for analysis, classification, and filtering to generate a bare earth surface model in which the above ground features are removed from the data set. The point cloud was manipulated within the Optech or Leica software; GeoCue, TerraScan, and TerraModeler software was used for the automated data classification, manual cleanup, and bare earth generation from this data. Project specific macros were used to classify the ground and to remove the side overlap between parallel flight lines. All data was manually reviewed and any remaining artifacts removed using functionality provided by TerraScan and TerraModeler. Class 2 LIDAR was used to create a bare earth surface model. The surface model was then used to heads-up digitize 2D breaklines of inland streams and rivers with a 30 foot nominal width and Inland Ponds and Lakes of 0.25 acres or greater. Elevation values were assigned to all Inland Ponds and Lakes using TerraModeler functionality. Elevation values were assigned to all Inland streams and rivers using Photo Science proprietary software. All Class 2 LIDAR data inside of the collected breaklines were then classified to Class 9 using TerraScan macro functionality. The breakline files were then translated to ESRI Shapefile and ARC Generate format using ESRI conversion tools. Breaklines were used to reclassify lakes, ponds, and inland drains. Data was then run through additional macros to ensure deliverable classification levels matching LAS ASPRS Classification structure. GeoCue functionality was then used to ensure correct LAS Version. In house software was used as a final QA/QC check to provide LAS Analysis of the delivered tiles. Buffered LAS files were created in GeoCue to provide overedge to the DEM creation. These tiles were then run through automated scripting within ArcMap and were combined with the Hydro Flattened Breaklines to create the 5' DEM. Final DEM tiles were clipped to the tile boundary in order to provide a seamless dataset. A manual QA review of the tiles was completed in ArcMap to ensure full coverage with no gaps or slivers within the project area.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received the files in laz format. The files contained LiDAR elevation and intensity measurements. The data were in Mississippi State Plane West (2301, feet) coordinates and NAVD88 (Geoid03) vertical datum (feet). CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The data were converted from State Plane (2301) coordinates to geographic coordinates. 2. The data were converted from NAVD88 (orthometric) heights to GRS80 (ellipsoid) heights using Geoid03. 3. The data were cleaned of bad elevations above 150 m and below 0 m, assumed to be errors points/noise. 4. The data were sorted by time.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
