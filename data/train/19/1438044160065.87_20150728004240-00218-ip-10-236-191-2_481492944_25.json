(1-1); an isotactic polypropylene with stereoerrors along the polymer chain as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,555,643 (1-2); a high-performance blend typically used in diaper stretch components comprising a styrenic block copolymer available from Kuraray Co. Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan as Septon 4033 (1-3); an elastomeric polypropylene as is available from Exxon Mobil Chemical of Huston, Tex. as VISTAMAXX 1100 (1-4); and two blends of a very low density polyethylene (EXACT 4049 from Exxon Mobil of Huston, Tex.) and a linear low density polyethylene (LL6201 from Exxon Mobile Chemical of Huston, Tex.) where ID 1-5 is 85% VLDPE/15% LLDPE and 1-6 is 70% VLDPE/30% LLDPE. Tables 1 and 2 list film properties., 20036=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/557,225 filed Mar. 29, 2004., 241376=A small web was produced using the 4-hole fiber spinning line described above. Bicomponent fibers (core=25% a random polypropylene copolymer (VISTAMAXX 2100 from Exxon Mobil Chemical of Huston, Tex.) and shell=75% of the plasto-elastic formulation 5-7) were spun using an attenuating air pressure of 40 psi. Spun fibers were first gathered on a small-scale moving table and bonded ultrasonically using a bonding device assembled by Machinetek of Fairfield, Ohio that incorporates a Branson 900 BCA Ultrasonic Probe (Branson Ultrasonic Corporation of Danbury, Conn.). The webs were bonded at a pressure of 276 KPa. The amplitude of the signal (dial position 50) and the speed of the web (dial position 8) defined ultrasonic energy and residence time respectively. Increased amplitude, higher pressure and smaller web speed all contribute to higher bonding The resulting nonwoven web had a basis weight of about 49.2 g/m2., 63139=The amount of first polymeric component and second polymeric component present in the bicomponent fiber will depend upon many factors, such as but not limited to, polymers present, desired use of bicomponent fiber, desired properties of the bicomponent fiber, etc. In one optional embodiment the weight ratio of the first polymeric component to the second polymeric component is from about 1:20 to about 20:1.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention. All documents cited in the Detailed Description of the Invention are, in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference; the citation of any document is not to be construed as an admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention. 7) Report the results for three samples. 6) Calculate the change in both dimensions as a percentage of the original dimension. A value above 100% is indicative of an expansion of the material in that particular direction as a result of exposure to heat (annealing). A value lower than 100% is indicative of a contraction of the specimen. 5) Measure both dimensions after the exposure to 60\ufffd C. 4) Remove the sample after two minutes. 3) Place the sample on a sand bed (replaces paper and talc of the ASTM method) and into a controlled thermal chamber at a temperature of 60\ufffd C. 2) Carefully measure the length and width dimensions of the sample and",
