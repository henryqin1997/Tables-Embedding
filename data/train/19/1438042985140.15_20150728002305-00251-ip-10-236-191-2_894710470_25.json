            "I would say Cedarville is relatively competitive among other private institutions; however it's still ridiculously expensive. I don't honestly want to be here any longer, but still feel God calling me here so I'm still here, and I would say it has benefits. I don't think I would have survived in my program at any other school. It is a direct result of a professor who came to me to figure out why I was stuck that I've made it this far. I froze up, but he made it a point to talk to me and now I'm doing quite well in my major classes. So I will say you won't get that elsewhere. Again I don't know other departments as well, but I know the engineering program is one of the best out there, and we really learn a lot. As well I do feel like most professors genuinely care about you which is really a great thing. Even so make sure you are where God wants you, and know he will provide if you are following him, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be easy to keep strong in that faith as the pressure of owing so much start to overwhelm you.",
            "Anymore I don't really do much for fun. I'm not even taking that many credits but I still feel like I'm always busy (Junior this year). However I do remember Freshmen year hanging out with friends a lot. We actually did Bible studies sometimes (no unfortunately doesn't seem to common here but you can find if you look), as well as movies and studying that consisted of a lot of talking and little homework at times. Long lunches and dinners at chucks were also pretty common back then. They are always doing things on campus, plays, movies, random games and events you can join in with. And of course Walmart is a common hang out place, not sure why, but my friends at least are always taking trips. They probably like just getting off campus which can be fun.",
            "People constantly complain about Chucks the local dining hall. It does have its fault. But it is a school cafeteria, and I honestly think they do really well. No it's not home cooking but there are a lot of options. Pizza and pasta bar is normally open, as well as taco bar, sandwich lines and breakfast foods including bagels, waffles cereal. My favorite part is the ability to cook. There are fruits and vegetables every day, granted not much rotation, so you have to get creative, but there are a number including tomatoes, lettuce, onions, green peppers, mushrooms, apples and others. You can make a salad, or use them to add to your taco, or sandwich, including different kinds of tortilla wraps and pita bread. One thing I like to do is make stir fry like dishes using varies veggies and seasonings and then cooking on one of the grills we have open to us putting it on top of pasta or rice. And they also rotate main dishes along with other things that are out regularly. It can get old, and the quality isn\u2019t always the best, but overall I would say food options at chucks are pretty good.",
            "I've enjoyed my dorm living having ended up in a good dorm freshmen year. However friends haven't had as good of an experience as I have, so you might end up in a negative environment still. Sometimes that includes personalty clashes, but it could also be due to differing values. You'll find not everyone at Cedarville is Christian, despite the proclamations they make to get in. Sometimes this can even include breaking rules such as drinking, even underage and drugs.",
            "At least in the engineering field I would say that Cedarville is academically rigorous. If you aren't motivated to do well, it may not be the best environment. While I don't think students try to be competitive, I would say generally on campus students have a higher level of expectation of what doing well in classes are than average. Although that could be due to a desire to keep scholarships that rely on academic standing as well.",
            "Make sure to pray talking to God about the decision, don't just go with it. Try to transfer classes from back home or other schools online. You can save a lot of money that way, and honestly I didn't gain anything better from taking the gen eds at Cedarville that I wouldn't have elsewhere. Try to find all your books on classifieds or online, the bookstore is more expensive than necessary. Consider getting an older version of the textbook. You can email your professor as soon as they give you your schedule and ask if an older text book will work, sometimes they can be a pain if you do homework problems a lot, but if you are just reading the book, it really doesn't make a difference. Get enough sleep, hardly anyone does here, but it's critical, and 7 hours is not a good nights sleep, try 8. If you have an 8 o'clock class, it's probably better to switch until 9 unless you are really disciplined about getting to sleep early. An hour might not seem a big deal, but it adds up pretty quickly when it's an hour less than you need every night. I personally need closer to 9 to be rested."

Also, once you are accepted, email or Facebook people that go to the university to get a head start with making friends there. Finally, don't worry about the classes, the professors do a great job of making sure that you learn, no matter your previous experience with the topic. Bang for the buck Cedarville is an expensive school. I am going to be in major debt when I have graduated. I tend to think that the education is worth the money, but sometimes it feels like I might be getting screwed. Am enjoying being here",
