            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IDENTIFYING SIMILAR SUB-GRAPHS IN A NETWORK - A method and an apparatus for identifying sub-graphs similar to a sample sub-graph from a network, in particular for identifying similar community structures from a network, are disclosed. Specifically, when a sample sub-graph is a community structure, it usually contains a plurality of nodes densely associated with each other. The method proposes first screening the network via key nodes of community structures so as to find sub-graph candidates that are potentially similar to the sample sub-graph, then strictly comparing the sub-graph candidates with the sample sub-graph to find similar sub-graphs of the sample sub-graph.",
            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ANIMATING TRANSITION AMONG DYNAMIC GRAPH SERIES - A method and an apparatus for animating transition among a dynamic graph series including a preceding graph and a succeeding graph which are temporally sequentially displayed. The method includes: selecting an unchanged node which is the nearest to a removed node and merging through animation the removed node with the unchanged node, thereby animating removal of the removed node; and selecting an unchanged node which is the nearest to an added node and splitting through animation the added node from the unchanged node, thereby animating addition of the added node. During the animation, the moving distances of the nodes can be shortened, and the crossing of movement paths and the crossing of graph edges can be prevented during the movement of the nodes, thereby visualizing smoothly and clearly transition among dynamic graph series.",

            "METHOD AND APPARATUS OF ANIMATION PLANNING FOR A DYNAMIC GRAPH - A method and apparatus of animation planning for a dynamic graph is provided. A first method includes grouping changed nodes into atomic partitions according to the relationships between the changed nodes and existing nodes. The next step is clustering the atomic partitions according to clustering distances between the atomic partitions to generate a running list for planning animation of node changes in the dynamic graph. The running list includes elements selected from the group consisting of clusters of atomic partitions and atomic partitions. The present invention is able to plan a multi-stage animation demonstration of changes of a dynamic graph and has a improved readability and animation speed."
