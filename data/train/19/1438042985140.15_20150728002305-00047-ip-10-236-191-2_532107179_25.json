            "Re: Liberty CRD One of the Most Disappointing? I went to check on the availabilty of a diesel Liberty in the fall of 2004. I wanted better mileage than the 16-18 I was getting from my Scrambler. I drive 800-1000 miles a week for work here in Vermont. The diesels were not available yet, and I don't think they will be sold in this Blue State because they are \"too dirty\", anyway I bought a left over Liberty Renegade with the 5 speed, I have 55000 miles on it now and get 22-24 mpg constantly. I am very happy with the mileage and the vehicle. I've had over a dozen CJs, a YJ and currently have a TJ over the last 33 years.",

Will be happier when biodiesel prices come down and its more readily available, also the low sulphur diesel will be available mid-next year, even further reducing emissions. Take care all. Drop me a line if you have any other questions about my CRD!
