Fast qualifier, Bud Perry was buried in the pack at the start while, Easey, Bill Butler, and Steve Curry jumped out in front followed by Nyle Weiler and Brian Heeney. From 6th on back, it was every man for himself as they raced side by side for position. Easey led all of the laps from the start, with intense battles for position back in the field. It appeared that the mod squad wanted to run that outside groove, starting with Chris Ozanich who worked his way up from ninth, into the fifth position. Dick Maurer and Jason Parish also took the high line and by lap 29, Maurer was up to third from his 14th starting position. Easey, Weiler, and Maurer pulled away from the pack after a caution erased Easey\u2019s huge lead. Parish went to work again on the outside and moved into the top five ahead of Butler on Lap 34. At the line, it was Easey, Weiler, Maurer, Parish, and Butler. Heat wins went to Troy Tucker, Dick Maurer, and Brian Heeney. The Performance Automotive Northwest Street Stocks lined up for their 25-lap feature with fast qualifier, Dane Long, starting 12th in",
