Porous objects such as plaster, concrete or wood should first be sealed to create a smooth surface from which to apply the mold release., 59656=This fast setting casting resin creates a hard yet strong plastic for many uses. It can be tinted with any of our colored pigments, however color will be offset by the natural white color of the product. Extremely fluid for all types of casting. Favorable strength and low-brittleness. No Mold release is necessary for casting into silicone molds. Pol-Ease 2300 should be used as a release from polyurethane molds., 54314=DESCRIPTION: Hydrogel\u00ae is a dry white powder which when mixed with water at a 3 parts water to 1 part Hydrogel\u00ae weight ratio (approximately 1 water to 1 1/4 Hydrogel\u00ae by volume) yields a creamy mix with a 5 minute working time. Demolding can be done, with care, several minutes after mix can no longer be worked. Mold Release: Use petroleum jelly for skin contact or Poly-2300 aerosol spray for industrial parts.}",

All TinSil 70 Series mold rubbers are tin-catalyzed, condensation-cure systems. They are ideal for molds where easy release or high temperature resistance is needed. They are recommended for evaluation as mold materials for polyester, epoxy and polyurethane resins and waxes. Mold release is not required for casting parts in silicone molds.

Demold Time:\u00a024 Hours Cured Color:\u00a0Red This mold rubber is well suited for casting low-temperature melting metals such as pewter. This rubber has a lower tear strength compared to the 70-25 but can withstand higher temperatures upto 400 degrees. Info: A more rigid silicone rubber similar to the hardness of a pencil eraser.
