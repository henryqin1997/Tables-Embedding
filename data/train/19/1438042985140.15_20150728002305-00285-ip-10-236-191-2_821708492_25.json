If aria-atomic is explicitly set to true, assistive technologies will present the entire contents of the element. If aria-atomic is explicitly set to false, assistive technologies will stop searching up the ancestor chain and present only the changed node to the user. If none of the ancestors have explicitly set aria-atomic, the default is that aria-atomic is false, and assistive technologies will only present the changed node to the user. When the content of a live region changes, user agents SHOULD examine the changed element and traverse the ancestors to find the first element with aria-atomic set, and apply the appropriate behavior for the cases below.
