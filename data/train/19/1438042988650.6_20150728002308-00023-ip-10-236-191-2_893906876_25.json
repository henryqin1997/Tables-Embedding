    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Brown University really emphasizes the learning experience for undergraduate students. With no core curriculum, students have the opportunity to explore courses in fields they would not have the opportunity to at other colleges. As a result, a student can obtain as specific or as broad an education as he or she chooses. Additionally, with the option to take courses for a grade, or pass/fail, Brown takes off the competitive pressure and simply encourages its students to try different things and put themselves out of their comfort zone without running the risk of damaging one's transcript and resume for graduate school education. But learning at Brown goes well beyond the classroom - almost all of which are taught directly by professors as opposed to teaching assistants, and which vary in size to accommodate all modes of learning. The extracurricular opportunities at Brown are incredible. There are a lot of service programs through the Swearer Center or other organizations, as well as many opportunities to learn about new subjects - whether that be through attending a guest lecture or debate, or just walking through the main green to see the displays.
