Carbidopa and levodopa tablets are available in a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa (25 mg/100 mg) as well as 1:10 ratio (25 mg/250 mg and 10 mg/100 mg). Tablets of the two ratios may be given separately or combined as needed to provide the optimum dosage., 6587=How To Transfer Patients From Levodopa: Levodopa must be discontinued at least twelve hours before starting this combination product. A daily dosage of carbidopa and levodopa should be chosen that will provide approximately 25% of the previous levodopa dosage. Patients who are taking less than 1500 mg of levodopa a day should be started on one tablet of carbidopa and levodopa 25 mg/100 mg three or four times a day. The suggested starting dosage for most patients taking more than 1500 mg of levodopa is one tablet of carbidopa and levodopa 25 mg/250 mg three or four times a day., 2249=25 mg/250 mg \u2014 Each light blue, mottled, round tablet imprinted with on one side and 540 and bisect on the other contains 25 mg of Carbidopa and 250 mg of Levodopa and is supplied in bottles of 100 (NDC 0228-2540-10), 500 (NDC 0228-2540-50) and 1000 (NDC 0228-2540-96)., 51938=0228-2540-10, 2714=25 mg/100 mg \u2014 Each yellow, mottled, round tablet imprinted with on one side and 539 and bisect on the other contains 25 mg of Carbidopa and 100 mg of Levodopa and is supplied in bottles of 100 (NDC 0228-2539-10), 500 (NDC 0228-2539-50) and 1000 (NDC 0228-2539-96)., 3157=10 mg/100 mg \u2014 Each dark blue, mottled, round tablet imprinted with on one side and 538 and bisect on the other contains 10 mg of Carbidopa and 100 mg of Levodopa and is supplied in bottles of 100 (NDC 0228-2538-10) and 500 (NDC 0228-2538-50)., 44534=Revised \u2014 September 2011, 51105=0228-2539-50, 8932=Based on studies in which high doses of levodopa and/or carbidopa were administered, a significant proportion of rats and mice given single oral doses of levodopa of approximately 1500-2000 mg/kg are expected to die. A significant proportion of infant rats of both sexes are expected to die at a dose of 800 mg/kg. A significant proportion of rats are expected to die after treatment with similar doses of carbidopa. The addition of carbidopa in a 1:10 ratio with levodopa increases the dose at which a significant proportion of mice are expected to die to 3360 mg/kg.}",
