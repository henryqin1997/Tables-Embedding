The NHANES 2003\u20132004 Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights . Certain sensitive data on respondents under 18 years of age (e.g. HPV typing results, sexual behavior variables) are not included in the public use files. These data may be requested as described in the NHANES guidelines. The phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such as the conditions precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and phlebotomy files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN., 6573=While HC2 is approved for clinical testing, the self-collected vaginal sample does not meet clinical guidelines. The HPV PCR tests are research tests. The HPV laboratory followed strict research QC/QA and was CLIA certified August 2008. Detailed quality control and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed QA/QC protocols. The analytical methods are described in the Description of the Laboratory Methodology section., 5121=HPV DNA detection and typing results from two assays are provided: the Roche prototype line blot assay (previously released, Data set name: l37SWA_C) and the Roche research use only Linear Array (LA) HPV Genotyping kit (Data set name: l37SWR_C). The Roche prototype reagents were discontinued when the LA assay was released and will not be available for further use in future NHANES cycles. While based on identical principles, the LA was refined for commercialization as a research use only kit. The two assays were comparable, although LA was found to be more sensitive and detected more types per sample (3, 4, 5). To assure comparability of results in the ongoing NHANES sampling, residual extracts from 2003-2004 were retested with LA., 12591=Reducing the prevalence of HPV infection is a Healthy People 2010 objective: \u201cReducing the number of new HPV cases can help minimize the overall number of cases of high risk subtypes associated with cervical cancer in females...\u201d Detection and typing of HPV DNA in vaginal swabs (in conjunction with testing of NHANES sera for HPV antibody) will allow evaluation of trends in prevalence of type-specific HPV infection by age, sexual behavior, and race/ethnicity. Two HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix) are licensed and recommended for use in girls and women. Routine vaccination is recommended for girls 11 or 12 years of age, and catch-up vaccination through 26 years. One vaccine (Gardasil) is licensed and available for boys and men. As vaccine becomes more widely used, the national prevalence of HPV infection will be critical for planning vaccination strategies in the United States., 14182=Title: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA Results from Vaginal Swab Samples: Digene Hybrid Capture, and Roche Linear Array, Ages 14-17 (swr_c_r ) Contact Number: 1-866-441-NCHS Years of Content: 2003 - 2004 First Published: November, 2010 Revised: NA Access Constraints: RDC Only Use Constraints: RDC Only Geographic Coverage: National Subject:Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA Results from Vaginal Swab Samples: Digene Hybrid Capture, Prototype Line Blot Assay, and Roche Linear Array Record Source: NHANES 2003 - 2004 Survey Methodology: NHANES 2003 - 2004 is a stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the U.S. Medium: NHANES Web site; SAS transport files}",
