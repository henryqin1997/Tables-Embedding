            "I've been fortunate to be raised around mission minded people. I've been to at least a dozen different countries on mission trips lasting from 2 wks to about 11 months! When I graduate from college I hope to devote a large part of my time to mission work!",
            "I'm an officer in the cooking club! My friends and I love going hiking & camping and this summer I'm working at a youth camp where I am helping with adventure camp. We'll be repelling, white water rafting and caving to just name a few things.",
            "Excellent food if you're a vegetarian! I love the food here - it's delicious and affordable!",
            "Love it! Now I'm an RA in a campus condo! Everyone is great here.",
            "You definitely need to study but that would be at any school! Whatever your goals are - go out there an get here!",
            "Plug into resources! Attend your worship services! Attend your classes! Study hard and get your assignments done quickly. Take advantage of the extracurricular activiities - they're fun and you get to know lots of people! I took a year off to be a student missionary in Africa! What an incredible experience!",
            "If you are looking for a small town college in a park-like setting; this is the place for you. Small class sizes lend to getting to know the students and the instructors! Emphasis on a personal relationship with Jesus is a plus for students who want to make Him a part of their life."
