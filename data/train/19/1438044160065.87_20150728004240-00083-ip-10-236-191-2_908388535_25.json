            "The food is not that great as well as the times the dining hall is open to eat. We recently just went tray less that would save money, etc.",
            "I do not live on campus due to the fact that it costs so much. The freshman dorms are too small is what I have heard and you can even end up in quads.",
            "The standards for students to maintain is very high. The professors require you to spend large amounts of time outside of the class room.",
            "Think about what program you want to do as well as how much you are willing to pay. Cannot exceed $1,000 in school balance which can lead into not being able to schedule classes.",
            "It is a beautiful campus with plenty of available intramurals and varsity sports. The costs is high and the school food is not that great. There are plenty of things to do on campus that help pass time."

They have now opened the grill until later and allowed students to use their swipes for meals instead of their cash., 33949=It is quite expensive to go here. For the fall 2012 semester, it is about $17,000. During the spring of 2012, it was about $16,000, so tuition is rising, but so is everything else in the economy.
