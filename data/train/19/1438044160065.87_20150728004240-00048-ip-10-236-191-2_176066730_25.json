Hart, William VanderWerff, Woody Rickerl | 5 Comments \u00bb, 112541=(7:13 PM): A slew of Youth Associates have been sworn in., 77489=Brett Barbre notes the recall is October 7 and general election is November 4. He notes the recall costs $300,000. He says Lindsey is a good Republican., 117308=(7:59 PM): Mr. White asks why Wyland doesn\u2019t want an endorsement made tonight., 286001=Here in Orange County, however, the Republican Central Committee is gathering to swear in its 2013-2014 membership, elect its 2013-2014 officers, and hear from Jim Brulte., 123354=(8:33 PM): Deborah Pauly says this is not about Harkey or Wyland: it\u2019s about process. (She does note Wyland has spent 20 years dealing with the BOE as a businessman.) Pauly says the grassroots is sick of the party jamming decisions down the voters\u2019 throats. Pauly points out that this is a five-county race; if different counties endorse differently, it could be used by the Democrats against whichever Republican advances to November. She says she originally supported waiting until after filing closes, but after listening to the debate, she thinks the Central Committee should wait until the voters have decided in the Primary Election., 113725=(7:36 PM): OCGOP Chairman Scott Baugh speaks about the successful Republican effort in the San Diego Mayor\u2019s race., 19798=Posted by Chris Nguyen on June 18, 2015, 113967=(7:39 PM): Irvine Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Lalloway announces that Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait has been named one of the two 2013 OCGOP Local Elected Official of the Year (alongside Supervisor Janet Nguyen who was also announced as the other winner of the award previously)., 116330=(7:53 PM): Wyland thanks the Central Committee for its work. He talks about how he owned his own 100-200 employee business and how he had to deal with the BOE dozens of times as a business owner. He says he knows how to reform the BOE. He says there were three efforts to unionize his employees, but he defeated those three efforts, so he knows how to fight unions. He notes his electoral background and how he\u2019s given over $1,000,000 to help conservative campaigns. He speaks about how he gave $100,000 to Tony Strickland\u2019s 2008 Senate race when Strickland defeated Democrat Hannah-Beth Jackson by less than one vote per precinct. Wyland urges the Central Committee to delay an endorsement vote until after filing closes., 29695=Posted in State Assembly, State Senate | Tagged: AB 2109, California Department of Public Health, Deborah Pauly, Jerry Brown, National Conference of State Legislatures, Richard Pan, SB 277 | 16 Comments \u00bb, 84753=Round 1 of endorsements are complete. Round 2 will be considered in September., 24424=Putting aside the legality of the Governor\u2019s direction to the Department of Public Health regarding AB 2109, this could be an\u00a0opening for opponents of SB 277 to persuade Governor Brown to veto SB 277., 124437=(8:41 PM): The vote count is underway., 21979=While Governor Jerry Brown signed AB 2109 into law, he issued a\u00a0signing message. \u00a0(Signing messages are an infrequent occurrence with just a handful of bills getting a signing message each year; the vast majority of\u00a0bills are signed without such messages.) \u00a0The full text of the signing message follows:, 306901=Posted by Chris Emami on November 14, 2012, 85363=CENTRAL COMMITTEE ADJOURNS AT 9:23 PM., 121650=(8:24 PM): Assemblyman Allan Mansoor urges no early endorsement because a lot of questions still need to be responded to. He notes he\u2019s worked with both Harkey and Wyland in the Legislature. He says he\u2019s endorsed Harkey. Mansoor says there are multiple Republicans in good standing running for a Republican seat. He says endorsements should only be made if a RINO is running or if there\u2019s risk of a Democrat winning., 76974=Desare Ferraro objects to the endorsement of Tom Lindsey for the November General Election. She says it would be divisive with the recall going on., 287360=At 7:33 PM, Mary Young nominated and Tim Whitacre seconded John Warner for re-election as First Vice Chair., 19950=So my post on\u00a0Tuesday about the\u00a0OC GOP opposing SB 277\u00a0has already cracked the top 10 posts of all time on OC Political, and it appears to be on pace to overtake #9 sometime this morning. \u00a0(For those of you wondering, #9 is\u00a0Live from OCGOP Central Committee: Efforts to Remove Deborah Pauly as 1st Vice Chair\u00a0from June 18, 2012.\u00a0Note to self: June Central Committee meetings equal\u00a0high\u00a0readership.), 115597=(7:50 PM): Harkey opens by describing the BOE\u2019s function. She speaks about her private sector career dealing with corporations and taxation. She speaks about the importance of limiting the field, so that campaign funds can be focused instead of divided. Harkey says it\u2019s critical to get the third vote on actions on the BOE. She speaks about her successful efforts to gain Democrats\u2019 votes to kill legislation. She speaks about how the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office credited Harkey with getting more oversight against cap and trade. Harkey says she could have walked into Supervisor or Senate, but BOE is the job she wants. She says both she and Wyland are also asking for San Diego GOP Central Committee\u2019s endorsement., 114735=(7:43 PM): Robert Hammond moves and Charlotte Christiana seconds the endorsement of Treasurer-Tax Collector Shari Freidenrich. She is endorsed unanimously., 114365=(7:41 PM): Chairman Scott Baugh brings up early endorsement consideration for District Attorney Tony Rackauckas., 287018=Long Pham announced he is running for the 34th Senate District in 2014. Anna Bryson confirmed she has filed paperwork to run for the 73rd Assembly District in 2014. Baron Night announced he was running for Buena Park City Council in 2014., 118925=(8:07 PM): Kermit Marsh asks what other counties the two have requested., 288233=At 7:38 PM, Orange County Central Committee Chairman Scott Baugh introduced former Senator Jim Brulte, who is running unopposed for California Republican Party Chairman., 22538=Current state law requires children to be vaccinated prior to enrollment in school or a child care facility, but allows a parent or guardian to opt out of this requirement based on a personal belief. This bill doesn\u2019t change that. \u00a0Consistent with current law, AB 2109 allows parents with a personal belief to reject vaccination for their child., 112857=(7:27 PM): Announcement of the passing of Jack Christiana., 23614=In signing AB 2109, Brown spent half the second and fourth paragraphs\u00a0discussing personal belief exemptions. \u00a0The fourth paragraph, the Governor, a former seminarian, issued his direction to the Department of Public Health to create a religious exemption on the form where they would not need to get a health care practitioner\u2019s signature. \u00a0In other words, a religious exemption went around AB 2109., 124225=(8:39 PM): The voice vote is unclear. Baugh calls for a standing vote. It requires 2/3 of those present and voting to endorse (i.e. abstentions simply lower the vote threshold required to endorse)., 70124=We\u2019re live from OC GOP Central Committee for the first round of endorsements for the November General Election., 119148=(8:08 PM): Robert Hammond asks how each voted on an Assembly bill funding Common Core., 136865=Tom Tait, when he recently appeared before the Committee, had argued that the city was not making money on the current deal with the Angels, and that the Angels were in essence being provided \u201cfree rent\u201d. The Orange County register in September reported that over the past 16years that the current agreement has been in place, the city made money in nine of those years, and lost money in the past seven, for a net loss of $52,000.00. A sports/business expert interviewed by the Register called it an \u201cirrelevant\u201d loss. Tom Tait\u2019s demeanor on that evening, was emotional, self serving, and desperate to convey to us that he was fighting the good fight and holding the line as a fiscal conservative. From that initial perspective to the message of last night, it is clear to see the emotionality in this divided Council. If Council Members Kring and Murray accomplished anything last night, it was to explain the emotionality and bolster the credibility of Mayor Tom Tait., 122511=(8:28 PM): Mark Bucher says neither should be endorsed. He is very concerned that both have taken union money. Bucher says money is taken from members coercively and spent against their beliefs. Bucher says union money is corrupting. Bucher points to what public safety unions have tried to do to Jim Righeimer in Costa Mesa. Bucher says the OCGOP should not abandon the no-union pledge by endorsing one of them., 133371=The OCGOP held it\u2019s monthly meeting last night at the (newly renamed) Hotel Irvine (Fka the Irvine Hyatt). The speakers for the evening were Lucille Kring and Kris Murray. These council members have been under attack for their vote on permitting hotel developers to have a rebate on the Transient Occupancy Tax, (TOT) once and if the hotels are built by the developers. This issue came before the council in 2012 and the council was split 2-3. More important is the May 2013 vote, when the issue was again considered and the vote was 4-1, Mayor Tom Tait being the only vote against the rebate., 21342=One of the most interesting items was\u00a0AB 2109 of 2012\u00a0by then-Assemblyman Richard Pan (D-Sacramento). \u00a0AB 2109 required a health care practitioner to sign an attestation that they provided information\u00a0regarding the benefits and risks of the immunization and the health risks of specified communicable diseases to a\u00a0parent of the student in question. \u00a0AB 2109 also required a\u00a0parent of the student to sign a statement that they received the information., 70843=The endorsements agenda consists of: 1.

Mike Posey \u2013 Huntington Beach, 112810=(7:26 PM): Minutes are approved., 77136=Brenda McCune notes she ran against Tom Lindsey in 2010, but she supports his endorsement now. She calls the recall a power grab. She calls Lindsey an independent mind and listener. She calls him a good Republican and family man., 119984=(8:13 PM): Mark Bucher asks if Diane Harkey\u2019s exception for public safety unions on her no-union pledge (required on the Central Committee endorsement form) applies to the past or prospectively., 119493=(8:10 PM): Mike Munzing talks about his own efforts to fight AB 32 and SB 375 at SCAG and on the City Council. He asks Wyland about his $1500 contribution to Al Gore in the 1980s., 117067=(7:56 PM): Pat Shuff asks the two candidates what was their CRA score. Harkey says 100%. Wyland is unsure what his CRA score was, but got 100% from both Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and California Taxpayers Association., 133220=Posted by Brenda McCune on January 21, 2014, 287482=At 7:34 PM, Bill Brough nominated Mary Young for re-election as Second Vice Chair., 121553=(8:23 PM): David Shawver says candidates should have formed committees months ago., 290737=At 7:57 PM, Jon Fleischman moved and Mary Young seconded for the OC GOP to endorse Jim Brulte for CRP Chair. The motion passed by acclimation., 147052=Posted by Chris Emami on December 3, 2013, 112930=(7:29 PM): The candidates and elected officials present are introducing themselves: Lucille Kring, Ceci Iglesias, Michelle Steel, Diane Harkey, Baron Night, David Shawver, Robert Hammond, Scott Voigts, Tony Beall, Mike Munzing, Robert Ming, Jim Righeimer, Steven Choi, Phillip Chen, Helen Hayden, Paul Glaab, Tom Tait, Julia Ross, Michael Glen, Tim Shaw, Brett Barbre, Travis Allen, Deborah Pauly, Mark Wyland, Jeff Lalloway, Fred Whitaker, Michael Gates, Steve Nagel, Mark McCurdy, Janet Nguyen, Matt Harper, Lee Ramos, Hugh Nguyen, Dean Grose, Lynn Schott, Jeff Ferguson, Allan Mansoor, Kevin Haskin, Shari Freidenrich, Keith Curry, Ray Grangoff, Eric Woolery, Carlos Vazquez, Claude Parrish, Anna Bryson, Tony Rackauckas, Long Pham, Emanuel Patrascu, Don Wagner, and Young Kim., 31513=Posted by Chris Nguyen on March 23, 2015, 285590=Posted by Chris Nguyen on January 21, 2013, 121453=(8:22 PM): Tim Whitacre moves and Mary Young seconds the endorsement of Diane Harkey., 106154=A letter I received from Mark Wyland dated February 13, 2014, stated, \u201cMy view has always been that the best role for the party is to stay out of Republican on Republican races,\u00a0and to help unify everyone after the June vote. \u00a0\u2026\u2026With that in mind, I would ask the Orange County Republican Party not pick favorites between three Republicans. \u00a0Speaking for myself,\u00a0I can\u2019t think of anything I have done over the years to deserve having my party endorse against me. \u00a0\u2026. I do not request my party\u2019s endorsement and would deeply appreciate it if my party would not endorse against me.\u201d, 121300=(8:21 PM): Baugh states that no further questions can be asked directly of the candidates due to the Central Committee\u2019s time limit rules., 122938=(8:30 PM): Tony Beall urges the Central Committee to take a leadership role to influence the electorate. Beall says he\u2019s been Mayor of Rancho Santa Margarita, which is represented by both Harkey and Wyland. He says Harkey is regularly in his city, and he\u2019s never met Wyland. Beall acknowledges that Wyland has assisted California campaigns but not OC campaigns. He says Harkey has helped OC campaigns., 74875=8:02 PM: Chairman Scott Baugh reveals more than $10,000 in union contributions for Lucille Kring despite her signing the nonunion pledge. He makes a scathing speech blasting Kring for breaking her word. If she disagrees with the pledge, she shouldn\u2019t have signed it, Baugh says. Kring attempts to protest, but cannot speak as a nonmember of the Central Committee. Baugh entertains a motion from Tim Whitacre to endorse Tom Tait for Mayor of Anaheim., 124145=Baugh says it would violate a 2010 resolution but not the bylaws., 290894=Baugh then outlined the top lessons of 2012. 1. GOTV and grassroots matter. He cited numerous instances of close races and noted that a shift in just 500,000 votes in four states out of well over 100,000,000 votes in fifty states could have made Mitt Romney president. 2. Messengers matter. Baugh noted Orange County\u2019s population is like few other metropolitan areas, with 34% Latino and 18.5% Asian. Republicans has lost 7% registration in the last decade, so Baugh says the GOP must work to fight this trend by better engaging Latinos and Asians. 3. Message and tone matter. Baugh said thoughts and ideas are more important than feelings, but properly framing thoughts and ideas are key. Baugh called the Republican Party the party of hope, opportunity, and prosperity for all. Baugh expressed disapproval of Romney\u2019s 47% remark. Baugh pointed to Ted Cruz\u2019s language of opportunity conservatism. He said the term of \u201climited government\u201d is meaningless to the unemployed or the parents with children in poor schools but \u201cremoving barriers and regulations impeding job creation\u201d and \u201cgiving parents choices\u201d are the language of opportunity conservatism. He said conservative ideas must be described in how they can help advance opportunity. Baugh said immigration policies are out of date, unenforced, or unenforceable. He said there is a labor supply in Mexico and a labor demand in the US, and people in Mexico are seeking a better life. He said America allows people to seek a better life and asked \u201cwho among us\u201d would not come to America from Mexico to seek a better life. Baugh said neither amnesty nor deportation is the answer; it lies somewhere in the middle of those two extremes, a solution that respects dignity and the human spirit. He said Republican policies must offer opportunity to all., 120736=Wyland notes they vote on 2,000-3,000 bills. He doesn\u2019t remember them all, but doubts he voted for that one in 2012. Wyland says he abhors naming a ship after Harvey Milk but it\u2019s possible he may have missed the vote. Wyland says the Assembly allows its members to add their votes after missing them, but the Senate does not allow such a thing. Wyland says he has introduced more legislation on illegal immigration than any other legislator, including requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote and redirecting DREAM Act funding to veterans., 118280=(8:04 PM): Jeff Matthews asks the two candidates if they\u2019re Republicans in good standing., 287579=At 7:35 PM, Mary Young nominated and John Warner seconded Peggy Huang for Secretary., 120502=(8:17 PM): Tim Whitacre asks if Wyland voted to increase property taxes in 2012 and if he walked out on certain bills, like naming a ship after Harvey Milk and illegal immigration restrictions, to avoid voting for them., 288053=At 7:37 PM, the entire slate of executive committee officers was elected unanimously., 112613=(7:18 PM): Sergio Picchio, former Field Representative to Assemblyman Don Wagner, is receiving the Donald Award for Legislative Staffer of the Year on the occasion of his retirement., 114940=(7:45 PM): Michelle Steel moves and Tim Whitacre seconds the endorsement of Diane Harkey for Board of Equalization., 75339=TJ Fuentes speaks in favor of Tait. He speaks of Tait\u2019s servant leadership, Tait\u2019s grassroots activism and efforts to support the Republican Party. Fuentes speaks of Tait standing by his principles of lower taxes, limited government, kindness, and transparency. Fuentes notes Tait is the OCGOP\u2019s 2013 Local Elected Official of the Year., 115398=(7:49 PM): Baugh says three BOE candidates were notified: Assemblywoman Diane Harkey, Senator Mark Wyland, and former Assemblyman Van Tran.
