            "There are options for food in multiple places on campus and many quick and student friendly off campus dining options in the near vicinity.",
            "There is a new dorm in the central part of campus and it is pretty well laid out.",
            "I would say that you should make sure to keep up on assignments because they require work. The classes here are to prepare you for the future, not be something you sleep through and pass anyway.",
            "Make sure to work with an adviser to line up your classes and make a long term plan for getting your degree. This will prepare you for the level of coursework you will be taking and give you some confidence in knowing what your future holds.",
            "It is a great campus to tour. Students are friendly and nice. Professors are really helpful."

African American Museum show-cases first successful restaurant sit-in of the Civil Rights Movement in 1958 in downtown Wichita, Sedgwick Co. Historical Museum., 55674=WSU is pretty good but i gave it an average 3. The reasoning is because it is WAY better than going to KU or KState and getting a TON of study loans, WSU is an affordable (2010-2011) $176 in state and this next year i think just south of $200, the reason for the 3 is there are still cheapter colleges (BCCC) but WSU is definately way better... unless you are out of state, i know many out of state students via living in dorm; they pay over $500 per credit, however, they say this is still worth it., 26370=Tuition is EXTREMELY low, even for a public 4-year. A full 4 years will cost you about $51,000, which is less than a lot of school's charge for a single year of tuition. Room and board are more expensive ($2000-4000 per semester), though local apartments can be cheap ($300 per month)., 27971=Pretty average. Dorms are very close to campus and host ~1000 students. Cost is pretty high in comparison to tuition though., 240590=The dorm life here at Wichita State is simple. It's very old, and out of style, but in 2014 the college is set to build brand new dorms., 130502=October fest occurs every year., 369173=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students Work on your general education requirements in the fall and your major in the spring, take any other classes that you failed/dropped/need in the summer! Bang for the buck Wichita State University is NOT cheap, but neither is their services or what they offer. It is good money well spent for good outcome so long as you apply yourself. Am enjoying being here I love the atmosphere, the campus is huge and beautiful, the students are amazing and the organizations are absolutely wonderful if you get involved with them. Am learning a lot",
