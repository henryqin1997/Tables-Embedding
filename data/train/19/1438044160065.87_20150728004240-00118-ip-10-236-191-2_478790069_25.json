For example, those of skill in the art will recognize that the elements of the illustrated embodiment shown in software may be implemented in hardware and vice versa or that the illustrated embodiment can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from the spirit of the invention. Therefore, the invention as described herein contemplates all such embodiments as may come within the scope of the following claims and equivalents thereof. #define KRB5_PADATA_PAC_REQUEST 128. The pre-authentication ID is: If the PAC is not present in the ticket, the computer may make a request directly to the directory service to get the required user account information. In an alternative embodiment, the computer can use local configuration information to fill in the required pieces of information and leave the optional pieces blank. This is because in this embodiment the local configuration information is a set of local user accounts onto which Kerberos accounts have been mapped. Thus, the computer can find the appropriate local account and get the information therefrom. The field include-pac is defined as follows: include-pac\u2014this field indicates whether a PAC should be included or not.",
