            "GAIN CALIBRATION DEVICE AND METHOD OF GAIN CALIBRATION - A gain calibration device includes an integrator, a first register, a controller, and a second register. When an optical image stabilizer is activated, the controller determines whether a current magnification of an image processing equipment is the same as a previous magnification. When the current magnification is not the same as the previous magnification, the controller reads the current magnification. Then the first registers stores a reference magnification, which is corresponding to a reference gain value of the optical image stabilizer. The second register temporarily stores a current gain value. Based on the reference magnification, the reference gain value and the current magnification, the controller calculates the current gain value corresponding to the current magnification for compensating the optical image stabilizer.",
            "Gain-Adjusting Apparatus For Optical Image Stabilizer And Method Thereof - A gain-adjusting apparatus and method thereof are described. The gain-adjusting apparatus includes an integrator, a first register, a control unit, and a second register. The integrator integrates the gyro signal data to generate the integral data. The control unit is coupled to the first register and the second register, respectively. The control unit determines whether the gyro signal data is either greater than an upper gyro threshold or less than a lower gyro threshold to detect the gyro signal data and decrease the gain value stored in the second register."

By pressing the shutter button, a first operation and a second operation are provided to trigger an auto-focus enable signal and an image exposure control signal, respectively. The anti-shake enable signal is enabled when the auto-focus enable signal has been triggered and the image exposure control signal is disabled or has just been triggered. The photo sensor array performs image exposure according to the image exposure control signal. The mechanical shutter is disabled and closed after the image exposure control signal is triggered for exposure period. 12-17-2009 20100067888 CONTROL SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR COMPENSATING FOR IMAGE SHAKE OF IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICE - A control system for compensating for image shake of an image capture device is provided, including a shake compensating module, a shake compensating switch, a control unit, and a",
