    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I am currently working at the Financial Aid office here,so the biggest advice I can give you is to keep up with your Financial Aid and scholarships make sure everything is set. Another thing is to have a good attitude, people are more willing to help you if you are kind to them. Bang for the buck Although it is not a University, there are programs here where you can earn a Bachelor's degree, and of course it's much cheaper. There is a food bank that gives food out every Wed. there is also a vegetable garden where they provide the products for you all you have to do is take care of your garden. Every so often there are events where they have free food and all you have to do is fill out a small survey. So there are MANY opportunites where you can save on food. Am enjoying being here I love the atmosphere here. There are many clubs that you can join. People are very nice, there are places that have couches and I've seen many people sleeping and no one bothers them, I've even sat on one of the couches and slept before my class starts. It's great!! If you're not one of those people that",
