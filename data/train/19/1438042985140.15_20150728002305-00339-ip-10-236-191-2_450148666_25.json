The system includes a Door Monitoring & Controlling Device (DMCD) and a web based Advanced Door Management System. The DMCD contains a NFC module, and one or more NFC close/open status tags which work together to monitor the status of the garage door. The NFC tag in this system not only provides status signal but also provides network configure data that eliminates the need to make standalone device configurable for network connectability. The use of NFC technology here will reduce manufacturing cost significantly, and make the configuration easy. The method and system also enable users to remotely open and close the garage door via the internet. 20140171032 01-31-2013 SYSTEMS, METHODS, AND APPARATUS FOR UTILITY METER CONFIGURATION - Systems, methods, and apparatus for configuring utility meters are provided. A meter configuration application may be executed by a device that includes one or more computers and that facilitates utility meter configuration. A plug-in module associated with a utility meter type may be received by the device. Based at least in part upon providing the plug-in module to the meter configuration application, a configuration",
