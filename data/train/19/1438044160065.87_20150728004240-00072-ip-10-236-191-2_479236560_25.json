The divided VCO and divided reference signals are then fed into the phase comparator which produces an error signal whose magnitude is proportional to the phase difference between the two signals. The error signal is then passed through a loop filter to produce M2076: Programming Guide Integer N PLL Synthesizer 35 - 1100 MHz to the same phase comparison frequency. The divided VCO and divided reference signals are then fed into the phase comparator which produces an error signal whose magnitude is proportional to the phase difference between the two signals.
