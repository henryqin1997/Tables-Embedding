In particular, SVR system 102 includes a processor arrangement 108, data store 104 as an integral component system thereof, and an I/O system 110 which supports network communications. In FIG. 1B, data store 104 is shown as being part of SVR system 102, but the present invention is not so restricted as illustrated in FIG. 1A. SVR system 102 may be implemented using a network server computing system such as one manufactured and marketed by SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. (e.g., the SUN SPARC 1000 computing system). Any computing system that facilitates service of web related documents (e.g., HTML documents, javascript files, etc.) via a network connection such as via the Internet and World Wide Web may be used in implementing the present invention., 24491=This application is a Continuation of patent application Ser.

Processing ends at step S5-9. Next, at step S5-8, window content streams may be updated so that dynamic content may be displayed within window modules provided by the present invention. At step S5-7, the user is permitted to alter window module states (e.g., size of a window, position of a window, minimization, maximization, etc.) within a CME of a WWW browser client without necessarily requiring screen refresh (e.g., is permitted to affect window module minimization, maximization, movement, resizing, etc.). Processing proceeds at the top of FIG. 5B. Next, at step S5-6, the WWW browser client manifests and causes display of received window content, HTML etc such as via dynamic (changing) display within a particular window module. Alternatively, depending on the implementation of a windows based CME that is actually developed and implemented in accordance with the present invention, content such as that received via a content stream may be displayed in an FSR, a layer, etc. within a CME. Next, at step S5-5, the WWW browser client accesses a network connection and the specified web",
