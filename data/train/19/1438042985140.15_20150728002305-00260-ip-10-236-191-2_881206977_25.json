            "At Berklee, most of the students get very little sleep. There is not as much homework is the sense of typing essays and reports, but there's a very high expectation for practicing new materials daily and regularly. The homework that is given is always extremely time consuming, but very useful.",

I hear the curriculum is rigorous but definitely worth the effort., 126940=The Berklee Beach is the area right in front of the 150 Mass Ave building where everybody who smokes, smokes. We call all of our buildings by their street address numbers like 150, 7, 1140, except for the building with the administration offices in it, that's the Uchida Building., 97566=Berklee doesn't really have any weird traditions and the campus is comprised of a handful of buildings within the Boston Back Bay area, so there aren't any particular locations of interest really. Although the 1140 Boylston St. building is the oldest and first Berklee building that existed., 275482=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 114094=Berklee College is a great place, but always remember to stay focus. May get really easy to get side track from your art form. Everyone is wonderful though, never a dull moment., 129531=I never lived in the dorms, and they are building new ones that will be ready in Fall 2013 I believe but the dorms aren't horrible. You get a mini fridge and you can bring in a microwave and they have practice rooms in the dorms and the ones in the 150 Mass Ave building don't have community bathrooms, they're all private ones in the rooms which is a plus!, 37392=i haven't experienced the dorm life yet but will in september., 7124=Don't decide to come to Berklee in April. You must decide well before that for several reasons. Take time to get the money you will need to attend. Also, spend much time getting ready for your audition. It's worth it.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students It's great for those that love music and know that their profession is going to be in music. It'll increase your all around musicianship and teach you more about the business side of music as well. Berklee offers everything a musician needs in the real world today! Tips for prospective students Practice hard and really impress them at your audition. That way you can get some money from them. It's really a lot of work, if you choose to do what you're given. But time management is key! Bang for the buck It's totally worth every penny, even though it's extremely expensive. Am enjoying being here I do like is here. There is just so much music everywhere and so many people into the same styles as you. It's great meeting people and have awesome jam sessions. Am learning a lot There is so much to offer here and all the faculty is there for you. They are so kind and helpful in whatever you need. All the classes you take really seem to mesh with each other. Which is really helpful",
