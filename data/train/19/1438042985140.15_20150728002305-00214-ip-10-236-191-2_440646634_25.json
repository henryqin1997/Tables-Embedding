Reinhart (1999) \"When Capital Inflows Come to a Sudden Stop: Consequences and Policy Options\" in Emerging Capital Markets in Turmoil: Bad Luck or Bad Policy?, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press 2005., 41984=As indicated earlier, investment declined the most during the crisis and the postcrisis drag was more pronounced for the firms in the top quartile of the 1996 debt-to-capital ratio distribution. Tobin's Q has improved somewhat since the crisis, notably for firms in the lower-debt group, but less so for firms in the high-debt category. Nonetheless, Tobin's Q remains below the standard benchmark of \"1\", above which, theory suggests that firms should resume investment spending. Profitability and cash flow have improved significantly for all firms including those in the high-debt group. External financing has also declined substantially for this group, turning negative since 1998, suggesting that they have been using generated cash flows to repay debt accumulated during the runup to the crisis. Consistent with this observation, debt-to-capital and debt-to-equity ratios have fallen significantly to levels comparable to those of other firms. For firms with lower debt, part of the cash flow has been allocated to dividend payments, and investment has improved a bit for these firms in the recent years., 69749=Bordo, Michael D. (2005), \"Historical Perspective on Global Imbalances,\" NBER Working Paper #11383., 36707=Table 4 examines whether the unexplained portion of the aggregate drag on investment over the postcrisis period has been accentuated by cross-sectional differences in firms' balance sheets on the eve of the crisis. For this purpose, we interact our postcrisis dummy with readings for selected firm-specific variables in 1996--the year that immediately preceded the crisis. We consider precrisis values of Tobin's Q, external financing, cash flow, debt-to-equity, and debt-to-capital. Columns (1) through (4) indicate that variations across firms' Tobin's Q, external financing, cash flow, and the debt-to-equity ratio on the eve of the crisis do not help explain the postcrisis drag. However, when we condition the postcrisis effect on the include the control for the debt-to-capital ratio at the eve of the crisis, we find--quite stunningly--that this interaction term essentially explains the remainder of the drop in the postcrisis investment rate. For this case, the postcrisis investment drag is reduced to about 2 percent, but it is not statistically significant from zero. This suggests that the precrisis debt level affected the magnitude of the postcrisis investment drag above and beyond what can be justified by firms' investment fundamentals., 89887=Figure 3:\u00a0\u00a0Aggregate private and public investment as percent of Gross Domestic Product for the Asia-8 region, 1991-2005., 21667=We use panel regressions to estimate decompositions in (1). For each variable we normalize the year effect to be zero in our base year of 1996- the year that immediately preceded the crisis.7 The estimated year effects in all other years capture the total effect of latent aggregate factors relative to their effect in this base year. Figure 4 shows the time path of our estimated year effects for the investment rate, along with aggregate effects for three commonly cited fundamentals: Tobin's Q, internal cash flow, and the rate of return on assets (ROA). The estimated time path for the firm-level investment rate-depicted in the top left panel of Figure 4-shows a distinct pattern that closely resembles the trajectory of aggregate investment shown in Figure 2. At the time of the crisis, the investment rate fell noticeably and then remained persistently low through the remainder of our sample period. The postcrisis investment rate is about 12 percentage points below the precrisis average, though the drag appears to attenuate late in the sample. The aggregate component of Q follows a pattern over our sample that broadly resembles that of investment, including a large decline during the crisis years and little sign of postcrisis recovery. This hints that less-favorable investment prospects may have played some role in the postcrisis investment slump. Return on assets (ROA) and cash flow deteriorated consistently in the years prior to crisis through 1998. Since then, both ROA and cash flow have improved steadily, peaking in 2004 at levels only somewhat below their precrisis norms., 113161=Figure 5:\u00a0\u00a0Estimated year effects for selected firm-level variables from a regression using data from our full sample of Asian firms, 1991-2005, with 95 percent confidence interval. Regressions control for fixed effects and firm size, 13483=As indicated in Figure 1, the current account of the emerging Asia-8 economies switched from slight deficits prior to the crisis to sustained surpluses averaging over 5 percent of GDP since 1998- around the time when the U.S. current account began to deteriorate. Figure 2 shows the current account surpluses for the Asia-8 economies in terms of the excess of national saving over investment. Saving rates on average have declined only slightly on balance, but investment rates dropped sharply from an average of about 33 percent between 1990 and 1997 to 25 percent in 1998, and have stayed at around this level ever since.4, 286734=To maintain consistency, the current account for the Euro area in 1996 was calculated using data from the same set of countries as in 2000. \"n.a.\" denoted not applicable. Source: International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook September 2006., 46578=For both of these cases, the results show no evidence that investment in the aftermath of the crisis was more sensitive to cash flow, even when we restrict our regression sample to firms in the top quartile of the 1996 debt distribution-column (8). In column (9), we test the second conjecture by interacting three variables: the postcrisis dummy, cash flow, and the 1996 debt-to-capital variable. This interaction term captures differences in the sensitivity of the postcrisis investment to cash flow for firms with greater debt holdings on the eve of the crisis. If high debt inherited from the crisis is restraining investment by raising the cost of external funds, we would expect the postcrisis investment by firms with higher precrisis debt holdings to be more sensitive to cash flow than firms with lower precrisis debt. The coefficient on this interaction term is negative and statistically significant. At best, the result suggests that the postcrisis investment was less (not more) sensitive to cash flow for firms with high precrisis debt levels., 45707=Due to data limitations, we are unable to analyze whether the drop in capital spending since the crisis has been associated with higher costs of external funding. Instead, we test whether the level of debt in 1996 affected firms' postcrisis investment response to changes in the cash flow. The rationale behind this test is that firms that have more access to internal funds should be less affected by funding limitations imposed from external sources. As such, the postcrisis investment drag for these firms should be less intense for firms with higher cash flows and/or more ample liquid asset holdings.18 Similarly, investment should be more sensitive to cash flow for firms that have accumulated more debt. We test both of these conjectures and report the results in columns (7) and (8)., 3873=In the aftermath of the East Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, the ratio of aggregate investment to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in emerging Asia excluding China fell from an average of around 33 percent to about 25 percent, and has remained at about this level in subsequent years. At the same time, aggregate savings as percent of GDP in these countries have declined only slightly, leading to a swing in the current account balances from slight deficits in the period leading up to the crisis to substantial surpluses in the postcrisis era. These surpluses enabled the region to become an exporter capital in defiance of theory suggesting that capital should flow from capital-abundant to capital-scarce countries where returns on capital are higher. Indeed, data on the patterns of global current account imbalances indicate that the wider saving-investment gap for the region has been a significant counterpart to the large current account deficits in the United States since 1997, suggesting a possible role of the Asian financial crisis in the emergence of global imbalances., 10102=The results from the study confirm the predominant role of the financial crisis in generating the current account surpluses in the region since 1998. We find that the shortfall in the region's aggregate investment that generated the current account surpluses owes to a marked and broad-based decline in corporate spending on fixed investment in the aftermath of the crisis that cuts across a wide spectrum of countries, industries, and firms. We then consider the factors behind the postcrisis lower investment. The analysis indicates that weaker postcrisis fundamentals (valuation, profitability etc.) account for part of the lower corporate investment spending, but more importantly, ongoing re-structuring owing to large debts accumulated and the excess investment undertaken in the period leading up to the crisis appear to be the main factors weighing down the postcrisis investment. These findings support the hypothesis that the region's current account surpluses are a direct result of the financial crisis, and suggest that as restructuring completes its course and excess capacity wanes, investment rates could rise to reduce the current account surpluses., 257729=Figure 11:\u00a0\u00a0Median firm characteristics by debt-to-capital distribution in 1996, 76865=Whited, T. (1992), \"Liquidity Constraints and Corporate Investment: Evidence from Panel Data,\" Journal of Finance, 47(4), 1425-1460., 93321=Figure 4:\u00a0\u00a0Estimated year effects for selected firm-level variables from a regression using data from our full sample of Asian firms, 1991-2005, with 95 percent confidence interval. Regressions control for fixed effects and firm size, 238001=Figure 10:\u00a0\u00a0Median firm characteristics by debt-to-capital distribution in 1996, 48299=Though it seems hard to believe that the adverse effects of the Asian financial crisis can still affect investment decisions after a decade, the results from this study indicate that the effect of the 1997 financial crisis continues to be a drag on firm investment. This drag in investment has played a big role in generating the current account surpluses in emerging Asia, and has enabled the region to export capital as the anemic domestic investment is unable to absorb the region's savings. The most important factor weighing on investment is the effect of excessive debt and excess investment that occurred in the years leading up to the crisis. As restructuring completes its course and excess capacity wanes, it is conceivable that corporate investment will continue to improve. We believe, however, that investment rates would likely not rise back up to the highs seen in the period leading up to the crisis. Since roughly one-third of the postcrisis investment drag can be attributed to fundamentals, it seems reasonable to expect investment rates to recoup only one-third of their declines after the effect of the crisis dissipates. For aggregate investment rates, this would imply increases in the vicinity of 3 percentage points, contributing to an equivalent reduction in current account surpluses all else equal., 218047=Figure 8:\u00a0\u00a0Top Panel: Estimated aggregate time effects on investment rate of small, medium and large firms from a regression using our panel of firms in Asia-8 countries, 1991-2005.

The firm-level data were constructed using information from the Worldscope Database and include data from 3,750 publicly listed companies in eight countries that were more affected by the financial crisis. Although data are available for some firms prior to 1991, the coverage is generally quite thin prior to 1991 so we limit our sample to the period from 1991 to 2005. The number of firms available in the Worldscope dataset grows substantially over the course of the sample period, which suggests that changes in sample composition may be an important issue. For this reason, we focus exclusively on regression estimates in the within dimension and control for identifiable firm characteristics in order to limit the effect on our estimates of changing sample composition., 74511=Mendoza, E.G., Quadrini, V., and Rios-Rull, J.S. (2007), \"Financial Integration, Financial Deepness, and Global Imbalances\" NBER Working Paper 12909., 39540=To further understand the apparent debt hangover effect identified in the previous section, we plot in Figures 10 and 11 some characteristics of firms grouped by their debt-to-capital distribution in 1996 (top quartile, mid quartiles, and bottom quartile). Firms in the top quartile of the 1996 debt-to-capital distribution accumulated sizeable debt obligations in the years leading up to the crisis. This is consistent with the substantial amount of capital that flowed into the region over this period, which--it is widely believed-reflected the abundant credit availability for many firms in this region.15 In particular, the bulk of this debt build up appears to have been concentrated in firms in the top quartile, whose debt levels exceeded both their total capital holding and the value of their equity. Indeed, for the rest of the firms in our sample, debt levels remained relatively steady throughout the sample period. This debt accumulation by these high-debt firms appears to have gone hand in hand with very high levels of capital spending: investment rates for these firms rose to roughly 20 percent in 1996. This suggests that the debt-to-equity effect identified in the previous section might also be described as a capital overhang. To assess this conjecture, for excess precrisis investment by constructing a binary dummy variable that takes a value of one for firms whose average investment rate in 1995 and 1996 was at least two standard deviations above the yearly cross-sectional mean. Interestingly, when we reestimate our regression with the debt-overhang variable replaced with an interaction between this crude proxy for overinvestment and the postcrisis dummy, the postcrisis investment drag also becomes insignificant (Column (6)). This suggests that these two variables largely capture the same effect, which supporting the argument that firms borrowed heavily to invest excessively.16 On balance, this high investment occurred amid a backdrop of weakening fundamentals. For example, firms in the high-debt group had lower values of Tobin's Q prior to the crisis than other firms, and these values were dropping rapidly in 1995 and 1996. At the eve of the crisis, returns-on-assets and cash flow had also declined sharply for the median firm in this high-debt group., 37972=Figure 9 shows estimates of how each of these four factors (list the four factors here) contributed to the total drop in capital spending over time. These results are obtained by estimating year effects after controlling for various factors. The bottom solid line shows the entire set of aggregate effects (relative to their 1996 value) without conditioning for any fundamentals. The area between each chart and the bottom solid line captures the portion of the postcrisis investment drag that is explained away by each of the variables shown. For example, controlling for Tobin's Q, reduces the postcrisis investment drag by about 3 percentage points on average. Cash flow and external financing, taken together, explain an even smaller fraction of the postcrisis investment drag- around 1 percentage point. However, when we allow the year effects to interact with the eve-of-the-crisis debt-to-capital ratio, the postcrisis investment drag is almost entirely accounted for. Taken at face value, these estimates suggest that while poorer fundamentals contributed to the drop in capital spending after the crisis-cross-sectional, variations in the debt-to-capital ratio on the eve of the crisis appear to be the single most important factor behind the postcrisis investment drag. According to the estimates in this figure, this debt hangover effect has been attenuating in recent years. In the following section, we further explore this finding in more detail., 303033=Current account balances excluding oil are calculated by extracting net trade in oil from the overall balance.

Nearly all of the decline in the aggregate investment rate can be attributed to private investment behavior, as the public sector's investment rate held steady at about 5 percent of GDP since 1991. The private investment rate on the other hand dropped significantly during the crisis period, from over 27 percent of GDP in 1996 to below 20 percent in 1999. The drop in the private sector investment rate (even as the saving rates remained high) accounts for the swing in the current account from deficits to surpluses among the Asia-8 economies since 1998, and appears to have played a large role in the emergence of current account surpluses., 93721=Note: For all variables, the time effect for 1996 is set to zero., 71122=Erickson, Timothy and Whited, Toni M. (2000), \"Measurement Error and the Relationship between Investment and q,\" Journal of Political Economy, 108(2000), 1027-1057., 49636=The results from this study have implications that present challenges for some alternative explanations for emerging Asia's current account surpluses. Recent papers by Dooley, Folkerts-Landau and Garber argue that the current account surpluses in emerging market economies are the result of deliberate government policies to promote export led-growth. According to this explanation, investment from domestic sources is inefficient for fostering growth and emerging market economies require foreign direct investment to reach their development objectives. This argument suggests that current account surpluses are necessary to accumulate assets that are in turn invested in developed economies as potential collateral to induce inward foreign direct investment (FDI) from those developed countries (see Dooley, Folkerts-Landau and Garber, 2003, 2004). A similar line of argument by Mann [2004] suggests that the current account surpluses in Asia are the result of a shift in policy to promote export-led growth after domestic-led growth in the early 1990s resulted in the Asian financial crisis. Yet another popular explanation attributes emerging Asia's surpluses to underdeveloped financial systems that are unable to intermediate domestic saving (Prasad, Rajan, and Subramanian [2006]) or to fulfill local residents' needs for high quality foreign financial assets (Mendoza, Quadrini, and Rios-Rull [2007])., 230944=Figure 9:\u00a0\u00a0Investment year effects after controlling for fundamentals and precrisis conditions shown. Effects are estimated using our full sample of Asian firms from 1991 to 2005, and control for fixed effects and firm size., 173273=Figure 7:\u00a0\u00a0Top Panel: Estimated aggregate time effects on investment rate for each one-digit industry level from a regression using our panel of firms in Asia-8 countries, 1991-2005. Bottom Panel: Estimated mean postcrisis drag on investment rate for each one-digit industry level, with 95 percent confidence interval. Both regressions also control for fixed effects, 43115=All told, the evidence suggests the postcrisis investment drag is indeed a direct effect of the financial crisis, rather than a consequence of deliberate government policies to boost the current account. Since the crisis, however, investment rates have remained low despite significant improvements in fundamentals such as profitability and cash flow, consistent with a scenario where excess capacity inherited from the precrisis period reduced the need for additional investment spending in the postcrisis period as indicated by lower values of Tobin's Q. The financial crisis effect is most pronounced for high-debt firms that, taken together, accounted for about 25 percent of total investment in 1996. These firms apparently used high levels of debt financing to maintain excessive levels of capital spending during the runup to the crisis., 76305=Roubini, Nouriel and Setser, Brad (2004), \"The US as Net Debtor: The Sustainability of the US External Imbalances,\" New York University (mimeo), November 2004., 11916=Table 1 presents the patterns of the global current account balances and highlights the importance of emerging Asia. The growing deficit in the United States (U.S.), particularly since the Asian financial crisis, mirrors the growing surplus in emerging Asia. Adjusting the current accounts to exclude oil imports and exports paints a clear picture of U.S. deficits almost totally offset by emerging Asia's surpluses as indicated in Table 2.3 At the eve of the crisis in 1996, emerging Asia excluding China registered a $6 billion current account deficit. The deficit reversed to a $110 billion surplus in 1998 that widened further to over $200 billion in 2005. During the same period, China's current account surplus rose from $11 billion in 1996 to $214 billion in 2005. Emerging Asia as a whole remains the single largest counterpart to the U.S. current account balance, tallying a $416 billion surplus to the U.S. $556 billion deficit, excluding oil, in 2005. This surplus is split nearly down the middle between China and the combined surplus in the Asia-8 region: Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. These patterns of global current account balances popularized the conundrum that developing economies have turned into net exporters of capital, which contradicts theory suggesting that capital should flow from capital-abundant advanced countries to capital-scarce developing countries where returns on capital are higher., 348780=5.\u00a0\u00a0The firm-level fixed effect also controls for a number of effects that cannot be separately identified, including fixed firm characteristics, country effects, industry effects, and an aggregate effect for our baseline year of 1996.\u00a0Return to text}",
