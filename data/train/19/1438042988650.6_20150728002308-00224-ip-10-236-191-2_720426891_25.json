That does not include\u00a0the '09 Twins-Tigers AL Central tiebreaker. The net's first season of telecasts in '08 averaged 0.5 U.S. rating and 624,000 viewers, excluding that season's White Sox-Twins AL Central tiebreaker. None of the net's telecasts this season topped the 1 million viewer mark despite the net airing 12 Yankees games. Just one regular-season, non-tiebreaker telecast on TBS has topped 1 million viewers in the three years -- an Indians-Yankees game from April 19, 2009., 27708=STRASMAS PRESENT: Nationals P Stephen Strasburg's MLB debut on June 8 marked MLB Network's highest-rated and most-viewed game this season, the first year that the net was rated by Nielsen. MLB Network from April to September saw a 51% increase in average primetime viewers, with August marking the best two months in the net's history with an average of 150,000 viewers. Weeknight games from August 2-6 also marked the net's most-viewed week ever with 220,000 primetime viewers per night. MLB Network\u00a0saw spikes in its audience when it cut to major performances, including 300% bumps for the finishes of perfect games by A's P Dallas Braden on May 9 and Phillies P Roy Halladay on May 30. The net also saw a 330% increase in audience when it cut to Tigers P Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game on June 2., 62182=I WANT THE TRUTH! In L.A., Kenneth Turan writes \"Secretariat\" is \"hardly the place to look for a thoroughly factual account of the events in William Nack's book of the same name.\" The film's credits note \"Secretariat\" is \"suggested by\" Nack's book, not the customary \"based on\" (L.A. TIMES, 10/8). The THOROUGHBRED TIMES' Frank Angst wrote while the movie \"takes plenty of liberties with the facts, it seems to have little interest in adding to Secretariat's legend.\" As a character, the horse is \"portrayed more as an underdog than a once-in-a-lifetime freak of nature\" (THOROUGHBREDTIMES.com, 10/4). In L.A., Kevin Modesti writes on one hand, \"Secretariat\" is a \"sweet celebration of the horse, his owner and his time.\" On the other hand, \"in a weird way it ends up diminishing Secretariat.\" The film \"misleads newcomers to the topic by taking the story of the utter domination of the 1973 Triple Crown by a freakish talent and shrink-wrapping it into an underdog package\" (L.A.

Ad Choices., 53531=The Islanders are on the verge of \"forming one of the odder media partnerships in professional sports,\" reportedly teaming with Hofstra Univ.'s WRHU-FM for radio broadcasts of the team's games, according to Ken Belson of the N.Y. TIMES. Former Islanders VP/Media Relations Chris Botta reported\u00a0on his blog the team is \"close to a deal\" with the on-campus WRHU ahead of Saturday's season-opener against the Stars. WRHU is a 470-watt station; by contrast, Rangers games are broadcast on ESPN Radio 1050 N.Y., a 50,000-watt station. The agreement with WRHU would \"give the Islanders a chance to save money because Hofstra students would serve as intermission hosts, sideline reporters and perhaps color commentators.\" They also reportedly would \"handle some of the engineering and production.\" It is unclear, however, \"how closely the students would work with Chris King, the Islanders\u2019 main radio broadcaster.\" Belson notes \"most teams pay radio stations to carry their games,\" though it is \"unclear how much the Islanders might pay Hofstra.\" For the past two seasons, Islanders games were carried by the Long Island Radio Group, which broadcast night games on WMJC-FM and day games on WHLI-AM (N.Y. TIMES, 10/8). On Long Island, Neil Best notes the Islanders last season \"frustrated many fans by eliminating their radio announcers and simulcasting audio of the television account on radio,\" but the WRHU deal would \"end that arrangement\" (NEWSDAY, 10/8)., 13554=Fox averaged a 1.8 final Nielsen rating and 2.7 million viewers for its Saturday MLB telecasts this season, flat with last year's record-low figures. Ratings and viewership had declined the previous five seasons for\u00a0Fox' regular-season package. The net\u00a0finished on a high note last Saturday, earning a 2.2 rating and 3.4 million viewers, up 83% from a 1.2 rating and 1.7 million viewers for last year's finale. Fox' primetime telecast on May 22 was the net's highest-rated and most-viewed coverage of the season with a 2.7 rating and 4.3 million viewers. Among afternoon telecasts, coverage on May 8 featuring Yankees-Red Sox was tops with a 2.5 rating and 3.7 million viewers., 34277=PENNANT FEVER: CSN Bay Area averaged an 11.83 local rating and over 300,710 HHs for its telecast of the Oct. 3 Padres-Giants game, during which the Giants clinched the NL West. The game is the net's highest-rated Giants game ever, besting the Oct. 1 game against the Padres, which averaged a 10.55 rating. Twenty of the 24 Giants games that aired on the net beginning on September\u00a01 were the highest-rated program for the day (CSN)....In California, John Maffei notes Channel 4 San Diego averaged a 5.4 local rating for its Padres telecasts this season, up 42% from last year, and averaged a 6.6 for its primetime Padres broadcasts, up 57%. Each ratings point \"represents about 11,000 viewers.\" Channel 4 averaged a 9.4 rating for the Oct. 1 Padres-Giants game, with the postgame show \"posting a solid 2.5.\" KSWB-Fox averaged a 7.7 for the Oct. 2 Padres-Giants game, while the Oct. 3 game, which aired on Channel 4 -- \"without the conflict of a blacked-out Chargers game -- did a 10.3 rating\" (NORTH COUNTY TIMES, 10/8)., 19919=BRISTOL BALL: ESPN averaged a 1.4 U.S. rating and 2.2 million viewers for its 24 \"Sunday Night Baseball\" telecasts this season, down 13% and 12%, respectively, from a 1.6 rating and 2.5 million viewers for the net's 23 telecasts last season. The net's Red Sox-Yankees telecast on August 8 was the highest-rated and most-viewed \"SNB\" with a 2.3 U.S. rating and 3.5 million viewers. ESPN averaged a 1.0 U.S. rating and 1.4 million viewer for 66 MLB telecasts this season, including non-exclusive Monday and Wednesday telecasts. That is down from a 1.1 rating and 1.6 million viewers last season., 56774=NASCAR during the first three races of the Chase for the Sprint Cup on ESPN \"has lost an average of a fourth of its viewing audience from one year ago at the start of the Chase\" on ABC, and the ratings drop is \"developing into a very disturbing pattern,\" according to\u00a0Jim Utter of the CHARLOTTE OBSERVER. Ratings for the Oct. 3 Price Chopper 400 were down 28%, while the Sept. 26 AAA 400 was down 23% and the Sept. 19 Sylvania 300 was down 28%. Utter wonders, \"What's going on with NASCAR's TV audience?\" There is something \"going on here when such a precipitous drop coincides with what is supposed to be the biggest part of your season.\" Utter: \"I can tell you this: Everyone in NASCAR -- not just executives -- but everyone who has a stake in stock car racing had best hope someone can find out why this is going on and attempt to fix it fast\" (CHARLOTTE OBSERVER, 10/8). In Las Vegas, Jeff Wolf offers solutions to the declining ratings, including ending the Cup season \"in mid-October by eliminating six races so the series doesn't have to contend with the NFL juggernaut.\" Also, beginning in October, NASCAR should \"move races from Sundays to Saturday nights\" (LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL, 10/8). However, driver Greg Biffle believes the Nielsen ratings system \"is out of date and does not accurately reflect the popularity of the sport.\" Biffle: \"We're going to continue to fight with this TV rating until we have a way to measure another way of finding out how people keep up with the race.\u00a0You can get it on your computer, you can get it on your phone, and everybody is tweeting lap-by-lap. So today you don't have to sit in front of the TV, you don't have to watch it to still be an avid NASCAR fan\" (Wilmington NEWS JOURNAL, 10/7).}",

We have a new deal with the NFL negotiated a year ago, and we are going to look to expand the franchise (HOLLYWOOD REPORTER, 10/8). Q: Is Sunday Ticket a profitable business? White: Sports is fundamental to our identity at DirecTV, and certainly the NFL is one of the most popular sports in America. For us, our partnership, which we have had for over 15 years, is really important. This year we expanded our service with the addition of the iPad application. It continues to be an important part of DirecTV. Q: How key is your NFL Sunday Ticket contract in the digital age? White: When you get out there, you realize how complex and sophisticated the technology we have is, and that every home is different. Trying to activate that technology in the home means you bump up against all kinds of unique things. I was struck by how physically demanding the technician job is and how complex the call-agent job is. We take 127 million calls a year, and you would like to think every",
