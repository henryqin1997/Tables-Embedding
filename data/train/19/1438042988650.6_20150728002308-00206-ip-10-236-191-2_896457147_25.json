            "When considering the price, I do not think I could attend a better college. There are many different degree's offered and with every class you take you receive the education expected. Many academic scholarships are awarded at this institution. With the increase in admissions, I think this is becoming apparent to students.",
            "Every month a calender is posted with the daily events for that month. Very seldom is there a day where an event is not taking place. They do a great job of offering on campus activities and clubs/organizations for current students. There are also three dances held during the academic school year, which attracts many students. Along with these activities, they also encourage students to attend Shawnee sporting events to support our student athletes.",
            "Recently, Shawnee just opened a new dining area referred to as the Bear's Den. In my opinion they have lots of options to offer to the students. The meal plan prices are a little high, but I'm sure you'll find this at every college you go to. In addition to the great food they have, they are always holding special events for the students. For example, every month they have international food day where they pick a different country and make food from this origin. For on campus events, they are also available to cater.",
            "Shawnee State University has some of the best dorms I have ever visited. Although there are four different types, all have the layout similar to an apartment. In my opinion this makes life easier for students when it comes to studying and doing school work. There are always activities for students living on campus. They make living in a dorm a great experience you'll never forget.",
            "This college is very hands on and interactive with the students. I have not had a professor yet who does not go above and beyond to meet the requirements each student deserves. The classes are geared towards introducing and teaching material with modern technology, making it easy for students to obtain the information online.",
            "Shawnee State University is a great college to attend. The professors are very interactive with each student. This college has many degree's to offer students."
