While Tenuta cannot get on the field, he can instruct his 6 returning starters to blitz, and blitz, and blitz some more. Anchoring the line will be senior Joe Anoai. The linebacking corp returns two starters and a key backup from last season. OLB KaMichael Hall and MLB Phillip Wheeler will give QB's nightmares with their side to side speed. The secondary is the question mark of this defense only returning one starter. Tech fans better hope the front seven can pressure the QB because the experience is not in the secondary to let a QB have time in the pocket.

However, those wins will come a little tougher this year because the Bulldogs do not have a proven QB to start the season. After a heated spring and fall practice, Richt has decided to start with senior Joe Tereshinski who played last season for the injured DJ Schockley in the Florida (L) and Kentucky(W) games. A name to keep an eye on though is true freshman Matt Stafford; don't be surprised to see him starting by the end of the year. The Dawgs have a trio of tailbacks that would be the envy of any coach in the SEC - Thomas Brown (736 yards, 4 TD) is the headliner of the group. Mo Massaquoi (13.3 ypc) returns for his sophmore season and will be the first look for whomever the QB is. The o-line will have some new faces and will be especially tested early in the season with the suspenstion to returning starter Daniel Inman.
