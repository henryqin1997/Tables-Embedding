Former Pakistan bowler Aaqib Javed noticed his talent and enrolled him to the NCA in Lahore. It wasn't long before he was called up as a replacement for Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amer. His ODI debut was cut short due to rain and then while bowling he suffered cramps. He was considered to be one of the tallest fast bowlers of his generation. In 2011, he was selected by the Kolkata Knight Riders for the IPL but couldn't participate.

But it was Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) and Pakistan batsman Azhar Ali who recommended his name to his head coach after Irfan impressed in a game against Pakistan A.
