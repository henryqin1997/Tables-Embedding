The call and slide presentation may be accessed at http://www.vimpelcom.com, 266611=BANGLADESH (\"BANGLALINK\") banglalink's subscriber base increased 21% YoY in 3Q12, reaching 26.8 million customers. Revenues achieved a significant growth of 23% YoY in local currency terms, driven by a larger subscriber base, in addition to a higher level of VAS and data adoption, and targeted start-up and reactivation promotions. EBITDA increased 9% YoY in local currency terms. EBITDA growth in local currency was slowed by higher subscriber acquisition costs YoY, as well as a market dynamic of increased activations in September, in anticipation of lower future sales due to regulatory requirements on registration of sim cards prior to activation, which was implemented in mid-October., 406726=ABOUT VIMPELCOM LTD VimpelCom is one of the world's largest integrated telecommunications services operators providing voice and data services through a range of traditional and broadband mobile and fixed technologies in Russia, Italy, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Cambodia, Laos, Algeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Burundi, Zimbabwe, Central African Republic and Canada.

For more information visit: http://www.vimpelcom.com, 76813=In 3Q12 VimpelCom continued to deliver on its strategic priorities as defined by the Company's Value Agenda for 2012-2014, with profitable organic growth in almost all business units. Without the reduction of MTRs in Italy, Revenue growth would have been close to 5% organically YoY and EBITDA organic growth would have been approximately 9% YoY. In Russia, the Company continued to deliver on its turnaround strategy., 985940=Copyright \u00a9 2007 PR Newswire. All rights reserved.

VimpelCom aims to launch its LTE services in Moscow and in 6 other Russian regions in 2013. The roll-out of the LTE network will need to occur with a phased approach based on a predefined schedule and must be fully completed by the end of 2019. A further condition of the license award is that VimpelCom will invest at least RUB 15 billion annually until its federal LTE network is built., 81401=VimpelCom announces today that it will hold its second Analyst & Investor Day on January 16, 2013 in London. An update of the Group strategy, the Value Agenda, will be presented both for the Group and for Business Units., 76033=On January 16th, 2013 VimpelCom will be hosting its Analyst & Investor Day. Updates will follow on VimpelCom.com, 165929=Net cash from operating activities of USD 2.0 billion at the Group level was positively impacted by the receipt of USD 190 million related to the monetization of an interest swap and working capital movement, partially offset by higher interest and tax payments compared to the same period last year. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities compared to 2Q12 was mainly impacted by lower investments in property, equipment and intangible assets in 2012. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 3Q12 compared to 2Q12 was mainly the result of the net repayment of debt. Net cash from operating activities in the first 9 months of 2012 is USD 5.0 billion, or 17% higher than in 9M11., 268160=SOUTH EAST ASIA Subscribers in the South East Asia cluster increased 4% YoY after the exclusion of Vietnam subscribers from comparative figures for 2011. In Laos, new promotional guidelines for new sales and a customer registration decree had a negative impact on subscriber acquisition, which was mitigated by successful data uptake and a growing contribution to revenues. In Cambodia, the hosting of the ASEAN summit boosted roaming revenues for 3Q12., 417174=For more information on financial and operating data for specific countries, please refer to the supplementary file Factbook3Q2012.xls on our website at http://vimpelcom.com/ir/financials/results.wbp, 404249=The conference calls replay and the slide presentation webcasts will be available until November 21, 2012. The slide presentations will also be available for download on the Company's website., 74957=The pro forma information presented in this earnings release reflects what the Company's results of operations would have looked like had the Company's transaction with Wind Telecom occurred on January 1, 2011. For further details about the adjustments and assumptions of the pro forma results, please refer to VimpelCom's press releases issued on August 18, 2011 and May 14, 2012 both of which are available on the Company's website., 218589=From a commercial perspective the third quarter was impressive with WIND achieving its highest ever number of gross additions in mobile in July and recording a strong performance in August and September. In the quarter WIND secured over 63% of MNO net additions driven by a solid inflow of MNP customers; market churn in the period however remained high at levels in excess of 30% driven by intense promotional activity on MNP. WIND's customers continued to increase their voice usage. Mobile broadband revenue grew 40% over the previous year, traditional messaging revenues were up 9% and fixed broadband revenues were up 3%., 217755=Total revenues declined by 5% mainly driven by the reduction in service revenues, as a result of the 53% cut in mobile termination rates which came into effect on July 1, partially offset by other revenues and by a solid increase in handset sales. Excluding the impact from MTRs total revenues were flat YoY. Mobile service revenues declined 8% over the previous year but, excluding the MTR impact, were flat over 3Q11 driven by a strong performance in mobile data revenues. In fixed line the strategic shift towards higher margin LLU led to an expected slower total subscriber growth and a 4% decline in service revenues, but yielded a significant improvement in margin. In the core LLU segment the voice customer base grew a solid 6% while the LLU broadband customer base grew 9%., 14660=\"We have made further good progress in the execution of our strategy, with strong organic growth in Group revenue and EBITDA. The EBITDA margin of 44% is the highest reported since completion of the Wind Telecom acquisition in April 2011. In our emerging markets (excluding Italy) we delivered 7% organic revenue growth and a 14% increase in EBITDA.\u00a0 In Russia, the positive trend seen in the first half continued, with year-on-year revenue growth of 7%, in part driven by strong mobile data revenue growth of 38%. EBITDA in Russia increased 16% year-on-year, with an improvement in the EBITDA margin to 43.2%. Our business in Italy has continued to outperform competition also showing strong mobile data revenue growth and CIS, Asia & Africa and Ukraine each delivered a solid set of figures in their respective markets., 126125=EBITDA decreased 2% YoY, impacted by unfavorable currency movements. Excluding these forex effects, EBITDA increased 8% compared to the same period last year. Double digit organic EBITDA growth YoY was seen in the Russia and CIS business units, up 16%, and 28%, respectively. EBITDA in CIS was supported by one-off adjustments totaling USD 12.5 million in Kazakhstan. Italy showed a YoY organic EBITDA decline of 5% in Italy mainly due to the MTR cut in July 2012 and Ukraine a 1% decline due to the ongoing transition to bundled tariff plans., 404510=Investor and analyst call replay US Replay number: +1 (855) 859-2056 Confirmation code : 44474823, 219236=On October 10, 2012 WIND signed an agreement with the trade unions and employees of the company to adopt an innovative cost efficiency plan aimed at reducing network maintenance opex by approximately EUR 40-45 million per year from January 1, 2013 onwards \u00a0through increased productivity of network maintenance personnel and a general reduction of HR costs. The project is expected to deliver the same savings as the previously announced managed services outsourcing plan, without outsourcing approximately 1,700 employees., 78282=The Company has announced that its Supervisory Board has set the date for the Company's 2012 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (the \"Shareholders Meeting\") for December 21, 2012. The record date for the Shareholders Meeting has been set for November 20, 2012. In light of the injunctions issued by the Moscow Arbitration Court in relation to the claims by the Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (\"FAS\") against Telenor and Weather II, the Supervisory Board has determined that if the injunctions are not lifted prior to November 27, 2012 it would be prudent to postpone the Shareholders Meeting. In case the Shareholders Meeting is postponed, an announcement in that respect will be issued on or around November 27, 2012. Further details on the agenda, the slate of nominees to the Supervisory Board and procedural matters related to the Shareholders Meeting will be made available through an official notice to be distributed by VimpelCom to its shareholders prior to the Shareholders Meeting., 265509=PAKISTAN (\"MOBILINK\") During 3Q12, Mobilink maintained its focus on voice, data, VAS and customer acquisition offers along with brand building activities, all of which led to an 8% increase in subscribers YoY. Total subscribers were 36.1 million as at the end of 3Q12. Revenues for the quarter increased by 4% YoY in local currency terms. Revenue growth is attributable to the focus on customer acquisition, as well as increased data and VAS uptake. This quarter all cellular networks were closed in major cities on Government instructions on August 20th (Feast day) and September 21st, resulting in revenue loss for all cellular operators. Furthermore, revenues were impacted by monsoon and floods in the southern and central regions. Mobilink's EBITDA grew by 10% YoY in local currency terms, mostly on account of growing revenue and ongoing cost control measures, including lower customer acquisition and retention costs., 77318=As previously announced, in April and May, a Russian court issued injunctions in relation to the claims by the Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (\"FAS\") against Telenor East Holding II AS (\"Telenor\") and Weather Investments II S.a.r.l. (\"Weather II\"). The injunctions prohibited, among other things, the payment of dividends by VimpelCom's wholly owned Russian subsidiary OJSC \"Vimpel-Communications\". In May, VimpelCom announced that in light of these injunctions the Supervisory Board of the Company considered it prudent and in the best interests of VimpelCom to postpone the payment and cancel the June 1, 2012 record date of the previously announced final dividend relating to the Company's 2011 results. The Supervisory Board of the Company will make a decision whether to pay the final 2011 dividend at a later date and will set a new record date as appropriate., 13319=AMSTERDAM, Nov.\u00a014, 2012 /PRNewswire/ --, 984329=Published November 14, 2012 \u0096 Reads 904 Copyright \u00a9 2012 SYS-CON Media, Inc. \u2014 All Rights Reserved. Syndicated stories and blog feeds, all rights reserved by the author., 264915=ALGERIA (\"DJEZZY\") Djezzy grew its subscriber base by 9% YoY to reach 17.7 million customers by the end of 3Q12. Revenues increased by 2% YoY in local currency terms and was affected by the shift in Ramadan seasonality impacting the peak summer period of July. EBITDA increased 1% YoY in local currency terms. Despite the extremely challenging conditions with the on-going restrictions imposed on Orascom Telecom Algeria, Djezzy maintained its leadership position with a 56% market share., 127596=Net income nearly tripled as a result of higher Profit before tax and a lower effective tax rate this year compared to 3Q 2011 when certain net operating losses incurred were not recognized for tax purposes., 79465=The Company has also taken several important steps with respect to Orascom Telecom Holding (OTH). VimpelCom and OTH, of which VimpelCom is 51.9% shareholder, have entered into mutual service level agreements to create synergies and operational efficiencies. Additionally, in light of an agreement between VimpelCom and Weather II that required the cessation of the use of the \"Orascom\" name and brand by OTH and its subsidiaries by the end of 2012, Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E. will be renamed to Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. Furthermore, following the change in Canada's foreign ownership laws earlier this year OTH will convert its non-voting shares into voting shares of Globalive Investment Holding Corp. (GIHC), the parent company of Wind Mobile Canada and Globalive Canada. As a result, the indirect voting stake of OTH in GIHC will increase from 32.02% to 65.08%. The required approval for the conversion from the Canadian investment authorities is expected by early 2013. Finally, OTH's shareholder loans to GIHC group will be restructured., 14247=\"VimpelCom Ltd\" (\"VimpelCom\", \"Company\" or \"Group\") (NYSE: VIP), a leading global provider of telecommunications services, today announces operating and financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2012., 256999=CANADA In 3Q12 Wind Mobile continued executing on its \"Value Plus\" strategy, adding primarily postpaid subscribers while carefully managing prepaid economics for both voice and mobile broadband customers. Wind Mobile crossed the 500,000 customer milestone in September 2012 becoming the fastest growing new entrant wireless operator in the Canadian market. The Company added over 53.6 thousand subscribers during the quarter increasing its active subscriber base to 510 thousand, with over 90% of the net additions during the quarter being postpaid subscribers.

Wind Mobile also continued to expand its network and launched in Barrie and Woodstock in 3Q12, increasing population coverage to over 13.6 million. The Company continues to focus on improving network quality and increased sites on air to 1,270 sites., 404883=This press release contains \"forward-looking statements\", as the phrase is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
