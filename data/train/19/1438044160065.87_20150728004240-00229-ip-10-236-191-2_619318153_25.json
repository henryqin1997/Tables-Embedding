These elements are useful in determining the types of natural vegetation or crops that grow or can grow in an area and in planning management systems for vegetation. Climatic data are observed nationally by the National Weather Service Cooperative Network, which consists of approximately 10,000 climate stations. The records are available from the Climatic Data Access Facility (CDAF) at Portland, Oregon. Climatic data are delivered to the field through the Climatic Data Access Network. The Climatic Data Access Network consists of climatic data liaisons established in each State and at National Headquarters. Climatic data that are input into NASIS are obtained from the respective climatic data liaison. Climatic data may also be obtained from project weather stations or from the State climatologist. NRCS has selected the current standard \u201cnormal\u201d period of 1971 to 2000 for climate database entries. Existing entries in the NASIS database may reflect the prior period of 1961 to 1990. Always check with your State\u2019s climatic data liaison before using a climate station that has less than 30 years of records or that is located outside a county. Footnote the source of the data, the station, and the starting and ending year of record. Means are given as a range to represent the change of the climate over the geographic extent of the assigned soil.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Flooding Frequency Class.\u2014Flooding frequency class indicates the number of times flooding occurs over a period of time. The classes of flooding are defined as follows: \u00a0 Classes.\u2014Estimates of flooding class are based on the interpretation of soil properties and other evidence gathered during soil survey fieldwork. Flooding hazard is expressed by flooding frequency class, flooding duration class, and time of year that flooding occurs. Not considered here, but nevertheless important, are velocity and depth of floodwater. Frequencies used to define classes are generally estimated from evidence related to the soil and vegetation. They are expressed in wide ranges that do not indicate a high degree of accuracy. Flooding frequencies that are more precise can be calculated by performing complex analyses used by engineers. The class \u201cvery frequent\u201d is used for areas subject to daily and monthly high tides. Definition.\u2014\u201cFlooding\u201d is the temporary covering of the soil surface by flowing water from any source, such as streams overflowing their banks, runoff from adjacent or surrounding slopes, inflow from high tides, or any combination of sources. Shallow water standing or flowing that is not concentrated as local runoff during or shortly after rain or snowmelt is excluded from the definition of flooding. Chapter 3 of the Soil Survey Manual provides additional information. Standing water (ponding) or water that forms a permanent covering is also excluded from the definition. \u00a0 618.30\u00a0 Flooding Frequency Class, Duration Class, and Month",
