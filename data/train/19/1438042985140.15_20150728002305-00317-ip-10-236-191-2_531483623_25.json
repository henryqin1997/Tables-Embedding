(a) Track laying standards in respect of gauge, joints, expansion gaps and spacing of sleepers for the track as specified in Para 316 of IRPWM may be followed. (b) The pre-tamping and post tamping operations as specified in Chapter 3 of IRTMM should be followed. (c) A minimum cushion of 150 mm of clean ballast alongwith adequate ballast on shoulders and cribs should be ensured before deploying the tamping machines. (d) The track geometry prior to deployment of track machines for new works of new line, doubling, gauge conversion etc. should be as under: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peak value of Unevenness : 15 mm on 3.6m Chord \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peak value of Twist \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0: 15 mm on 3.6m Chord \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peak value of Alignment \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0: 15 mm on 7.2m Chord The above track geometry standards are not safety/slow down tolerances but are only a prerequisite for deployment of track tamping for better machine productivity and their optimum utilization. (e) For achieving the track geometry parameters as above, suitable small track machines such as off-track tampers etc. may be used. (f) Dy.CE(Construction)/DEN(Construction) should certify the track geometry as mentioned above before deploying the track machines., 187593=The Manual for Ultrasonic testing of Rails and Welds( 1998) was circulated to all Zonal Railways vide this office D.O. letter referred above. Correction slip no.14 of May 2004 to the above manual is enclosed herewith for information and further necessary action. This has approval of Railway Board. This correction slip covers the following aspects. i) Defining size/shape of probes ( Para 8.1 (vi)): The issue of use of large size probes has been re-examined in the light of various probe characteristics required for rail flaw detection and the following has been observed: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a) The maximum dimension of the web is not beyond 20mm and therefore use of larger size probe is not advantageous. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0b) Large sized probes have less divergence and therefore there is no distinct advantage by their usage. 20mm diameter probes are expected to provide increased divergence. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0c) Higher diameter probes are also associated with acoustic coupling difficulties since the rail surfaces are not excepted to be even through out. Therefore reduction in the crystal size of probes has been prescribed. (ii) Change in the frequency of 700 probe for flange testing of welds from 1.25 MHz to 2 MHz: The considerations behind use of higher frequency probes are as under: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a) Higher frequency probes are considered to be more sensitive since the wavelength is smaller. Therefore, possibility of detecting finer crack is more with 2MHz probes. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0b) Higher frequency probes provide narrow pulse width resulting in sharper signals received from the flaws. Therefore, usage of higher frequency probes is considered superior. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0c) Higher frequency probes have superior resolution and therefore recommended for finer flaw detection. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0d) Higher frequency probes are associated with higher attenuation which is not desirable. However, considering the smaller zone of the weldment, no appreciable attenuation is expected. Therefore, considering all aspects mentioned above, use of 2 MHz probes has been prescribed for examination of foot portion of AT welds. iii) Corrections in Annexure-VI para2(I) regarding test free period of rails. iv) Revision to para 4.4: Modification has been prescribed in para4.4 to include spares for 450, 2 MHz probe and 700 ,2 MHz probe ( 8mm x 8mm ) for detection of half moon crack defect in web foot junction. Further, in order to ensure compatibility of spares with machine to achieve consistent and assured quality of testing , it has been prescribed that the spares of the USFD machines shall be procured from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) only along with the stipulation that trolley spares and battery can be procured from open market also. v) Corrections in the Annexure VII: Correction in the following have been made \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a) Description of oscillograph pattern of Normal probe 4 MHz within fishplated area and out side fishplated area for rail defects. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) Description of nature of defects of 700 probe for rail defect. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c) Description of oscillograph pattern of 700 probe for rail defect. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d) Description of oscillograph pattern of Normal probe 4 MHz within fishplated area and out side fishplated area for weld defect ( AT + FBW ) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e) Description of nature of defects of 700 probe for Weld defect ( AT+ FBW ) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(f) Description of oscillograph pattern of 700 probe for Weld defect (AT + FBW )., 166949=The requirement of a cook for BRM and DTS shall be met with out of the provision made for the machine to which these machines are attached.
