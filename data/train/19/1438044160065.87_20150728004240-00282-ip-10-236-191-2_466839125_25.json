    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, the present invention provides lotions useful as external medicines wherein chemical stability and percutaneous absorption of maxacalcitol as an active ingredient can be controlled by regulating the composition of components. As a result of mainly controlling percutaneous absorption by changing the amounts of components, optimal formulations required in the respects of pharmaceutical efficacy or side-effects can be proposed; therefore formulations for different purposes such as external medicines for topical or systemic application can potentially be proposed. Recently, some classes of activated vitamin D3 derivatives, particularly maxacalcitol, are expected to bring about topical pharmacological effects against psoriasis based on their skin epidermal cell growth-inhibiting and differentiation-inducing effects; they are also expected to achieve systemic pharmacological effects such as PTH secretion/production-inhibiting effects and differentiation-inducing effects and immunoregulation effects. This suggests that absorption control in external application is very important for attaining pharmaceutical efficacy of medicines having both systemic and topical pharmacological effects. The present invention also proposes a solution to this technical issue. According to the present invention, thermal stability and percutaneous absorption can be efficiently controlled by regulating the amounts of common base materials; furthermore, formulations based on the control can also be proposed. This control of pharmaceutical properties proved to lead to efficient proposal of desired optimal formulations in accordance with the purpose and method of use. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITIES Dramatic improvements in thermal stability were observed in the heat acceleration test as compared",
