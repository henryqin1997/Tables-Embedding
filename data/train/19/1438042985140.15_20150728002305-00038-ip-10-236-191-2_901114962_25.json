In the rule, the FAA amended certain airworthiness regulations for transport category airplanes to eliminate regulatory differences between the airworthiness standards of the FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). It does not add new requirements beyond what manufacturers currently meet for EASA certification and does not affect current industry design practices. This final rule revises the pitch maneuver design loads criteria; revises the gust and turbulence design loads criteria; revises the application of gust loads to engine mounts, high lift devices, and other control surfaces; adds a \u201cround-the-clock\u201d discrete gust criterion and a multi-axis discrete gust criterion for airplanes equipped with wing-mounted engines; revises the engine torque loads criteria; adds an engine failure dynamic load condition; revises the ground gust design loads criteria; revises the criteria used to establish the rough air design speed; and requires the establishment of a rough air Mach number. This document corrects errors in the rule by ensuring that certain letters in the included equations have the right formatting and therefore the correct meaning., 62853=Title 14 published on 2015-01-01, 61728=\u00a7 2473 - Repealed.}",

We must receive your comments by June 26, 2015. 14 CFR Part 25 Summary These special conditions are issued for the Bombardier Aerospace Models BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 series airplanes. These airplanes will have novel or unusual design features when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. These design features are electrical and electronic systems that perform critical functions, the loss of which could be catastrophic to the airplane. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for these design features. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards. 80 FR 30134 - Special Conditions: Bombardier Aerospace, Models BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11; Electronic Flight Control System: Lateral-Directional and Longitudinal Stability and Low-Energy Awareness GPO FDSys XML |",
