            "WINDOW REGULATOR SYSTEM FOR A VEHICLE DOOR ASSEMBLY - A window regulator system for a vehicle door module includes at least one guide rib integrally formed with the vehicle door module. A slider is at least partially received on the guide rib.",
            "FLUSH TYPE WINDOW DRIVE MECHANISM - A window drive mechanism is used to cover and uncover an opening formed in a first window panel. A second window panel is mounted for movement relative to the first window panel. The second window panel is moved by the window drive mechanism between an open position where the opening is uncovered and a closed position where the second window panel covers the opening. When the second window panel is in the closed position, the second window panel is flush with the first window panel. A guide member is mounted for movement with the second window panel and has a notch that defines a first path of movement where the second window panel is moved inwardly of the first window panel. When activated, the drive mechanism moves the second window panel inwardly to a non-flush position via the notch, and then moves the second window panel axially to uncover the opening."

Hernandez, Shelby Township, MI US 01-26-2012 LIGHT BOXES WITH UNIFORM LIGHT DISTRIBUTION - Light boxes for uniformly illuminating panels include a frame that supports one or more translucent panels. The light boxes further include a light source positioned within the light box. Example light sources can include fluorescent bulbs, incandescent lights, and/or light-emitting-diodes. In at least one implementation, a manufacturer positions a relatively limited number of light sources aimed and/or positioned in a particular way to uniformly distribute light throughout the light box and evenly across the translucent panels such that there are no shadows, hot spots or other non-uniform light patterns on the translucent panels. 20120020112 Published Description Patent application number Esteban D.
