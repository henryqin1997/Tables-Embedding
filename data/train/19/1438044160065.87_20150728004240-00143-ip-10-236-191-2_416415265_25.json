They should NOT be used to determine local water systems compliance with drinking water standards, nor should they be used to make personal judgements about individual health risks. Units: Sample measurements are taken in micrograms per Liter (ug/L) and are regulated in milligrams per Liter (mg/L). A microgram per Liter is equivalent to one contaminant part per billion (ppb). A ppb can be thought of as one grain of salt in a swimming pool. Data for Total Trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids 5, and bromate are presented in ppb. 1 mg/L = 1000 ug/L, or 0.080 mg/L = 80 ug/L = 80 ppb, which happens to be the TTHM standard in the Stage 1 DBP Rule. Results of Zero: A result of zero may indicate that a sample was analyzed, but that the result was less than the lowest value that the analytical method can reliably report.
