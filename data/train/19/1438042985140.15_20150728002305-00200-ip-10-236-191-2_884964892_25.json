            "Security is always riding around on bicycles or golf carts. There are blue light phones everywhere on campus and if you feel there is an area that needs one all you have to do is request one. Most of campus is very well light.",
            "Incoming students walk through into the arch out in front of Old Main the first weekend they are here and outgoing graduate students walk out of the arch after graduating. You are not to walk through the arch any other time or it is said you will fail out of school. There are red brick circles randomly throughout campus and it is said if you step on one you will fail your next test.",
            "There is one bowling alley off campus that every now will have a free bowling night. There is a movie theater in Findlay. Try to keep an eye out for campus events because they usually are entertaining.",
            "Although not terrible, there is definitely room for improvement. There is only one dining hall on campus so if they don't have something you like you don't have much of an option. The highlight of each month though is steak night.",
            "Being a small campus where you dorm will greatly affect your experience. Both years at Findlay so far I have lived in the all girls building. I have had few problems with anyone. Most people are considerate. All you have to watch out for is the cleaning ladies, they tend to like to talk and talk and talk.",
            "How hard your classes are will depend on your major. As a Pharmacy major myself almost all of my classes are hard. The Equestrian majors have a hard major more in the fact of the physical work they have to put into their barn work. However, there are also majors like Art and English that sure have to spend a bit of time on their work, do not have what I consider to be a hard course load.",
            "Do not buy books from the campus bookstore. Make sure to tour the campus because if you are looking for somewhere big with a lot of variety, Findlay is not the place for you. Don't worry about getting lost on campus, all you have to do is ask someone around you. Everyone is super nice and you shouldn't have a hard time making friends.",
            "The University of Findlay has everything you could want out of the college experience with the advantage of a small town. We have every kind of major from Equestrian to Pharmacy to Theater. Although it has it's downfalls I wouldn't want to go anywhere else."

Tips for prospective students Study hard in high school and do the ACTs and/or SATs. Make sure you are ready to be in college. Check into the size of school you want. Findlay is a small private school. Bang for the buck Tuition is expensive but if you want the best education....you got to be willing to pay. Am enjoying being here There are TONS of clubs to be apart of and there is always something to do on campus. There are intramural sports you and friends can be apart of...there's broom hockey, soccer, football, volleyball, and a bunch more I can't think of right now. Am learning a lot The classes are really small for the most part. I am a Pre-vet student, it's a popular major here so the classes get filled up quickly and are really full. They almost always open up another class to choose. The professors care about the students and usually have one-on-one sessions to help the students out to make sure they're getting the",
