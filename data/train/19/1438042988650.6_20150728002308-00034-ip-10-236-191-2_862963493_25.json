This compares to the higher end Conroe core which features 4 MB L2 Cache natively. Intel has shifted its product lines having the Core 2 line as Mainstream/Performance, Pentium Dual-Core as Mainstream, and the new Celeron (based on the Conroe-L core) as Budget/Value., 34638=The E5000 series and E6000 series use the same 45\u00a0nm Wolfdale-3M core as the E7000 series Core 2s, which has 3 MB L2 cache natively. 1 MB of L2 cache is disabled, for a total of 2 MB L2 cache, or twice the amount in the original Allendale Pentiums. The Wolfdale core is capable of SSE4, but it is disabled in these Pentiums. Pentium E2210 is an OEM processor based on Wolfdale-3M with only 1 MB L2 cache enabled out of the total 3 MB.}",
