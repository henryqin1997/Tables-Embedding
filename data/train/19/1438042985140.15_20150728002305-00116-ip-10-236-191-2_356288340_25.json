There are two stations in Guilin by now. They are South Railway Station and Guilin Railway Station. The railway stations are more like a mid route stop rather than terminus because tickets reserved in mid route stop are not as many as tickets in terminus. So, booking tickets in advance is necessary. During golden travel season, it is advisable to book some even earlier.
