I have had the pleasure of visiting the campus and it is very pretty. The dorms are nice and they have a lot for you to do on campus. The campus itself is easy to get around and is convenient for those like me, who don't have a car. So far, the faculty that I came in contact with are very friendly and helpful. I am satisfied with VSU so far and I look forward to attending., 226831=Relay for Life, March of Dimes, Car washes, Community service and soooo much more., 231751=YOU GO TO SCHOOL 5:30 TO 10:15 AND YOU GET YOUR CLASSES DONE IN 8 WEEKS. ITS A GREAT WAY TO GET AHEAD!!, 563444=I love the campus! Really small city though, not much to do. Weather is okay, it can get real hot in august/september.. I mean REAL hot., 336934=A big tradition here at Valdosta State is Breast Cancer Awareness, as well as No-Shave November. Join in on the many activities and become a part of a wonderful community., 437968=Wild Adventures is a theme park that is located about 15 minutes from campus. We even get to go one day during Homecoming week in October., 93016=We call November No shave November you can infer from that what you can, 257019=I don' t know much about the dining halls, but the food in the student union is great! Currently there is Nathan's and Starbucks to choose from, but we're suppose to be getting a Chick Fil A come August of 2012., 551269=There are a variety of food options. The dining halls, however, seem very repetitive. It always the same things in different forms everyday. Also, not too many healthy options except for the salad bar and fruits. Though, in January 2014, there will be renovations done in the hall to include more healthy eating options that seems promising.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here If you want the perfect college experience, VSU is for you! It is the best place to go if you want to get far away from home and still keep the HOPE Scholarship. While at VSU, you will enjoy all of the campus activities. VSU has organizations that hosts campus activities such as laser tag, flag football and Build-a-Bear workshops (which were free). I enjoy being here because of the warm weather (takes a while to get used to), the scenery (palm trees) and the size of the campus. Everything is in walking distance so you will not be stressed for time if you are running late for a class. You will enjoy your time being here! Am learning a lot VSU is a great institute to further your education. I must say that I am learning a lot. My teachers are great and if I need further assistance they are willing to meet with me during office hours, or e-mail. If this is not enough, VSU has a tutoring center called The Student Success Center. This is very beneficial and convenient. You can set appointments for any subject and based on when you are available. Just make sure you study and work hard, and you will be fine. I promise. Login",
