If you suspect user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for assistance. The location keyword is used so that active and standby TCP instances are independently queried. The active and standby instances of some NSR-capable applications communicate through two queues, and these applications are multiplexed onto these queues. NSR consumer demuxer (NCD) is a process that provides the demuxing services on the receiver side. You can use the clear nsr ncd client command to troubleshoot traffic issues. If you clear the existing counters, it can help you to monitor the delta changes. Task ID Task ID Operations transport execute Examples The following example shows how to clear",
