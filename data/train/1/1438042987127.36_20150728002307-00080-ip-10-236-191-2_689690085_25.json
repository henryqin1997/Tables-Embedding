He broke into the first team squad in 2011 following injuries and made his selection a foregone conclusion for the rest of the season. His partnership with Lee Gaskell - dubbed #lomaskell - was debuted for the first team against Leeds in March and neither looked back guiding Saints to the 2011 Grand Final.
