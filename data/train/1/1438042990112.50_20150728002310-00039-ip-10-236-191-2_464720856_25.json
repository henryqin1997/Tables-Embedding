These are: the Handshake Protocol, the Alert Protocol, the Change Cipher Spec Protocol (CCS), and Application Protocol Data. Another type of record that provides compatibility with initial handshaking for SSL/TLS version 2.0-enabled browsers is also supported. The SSL specification also defines \u2018control messages\u2019 and \u2018data messages.\u2019 Control messages consist of handshake messages, alert messages and CCS messages. Data messages are application protocol data messages. The SSL standard is described in more detail in the \u201cThe SSL Protocol SSL,\u201d Version 3.0, by Alan O. Freier et al., dated Nov. 18, 1996, which is herein incorporated by reference and is presented in the accompanying Information Disclosure Statement., 329567=[0255] TCP has a mechanism of providing what it calls urgent mode data, which many implementations incorrectly refer to as out-of-band data. The standards say that TCP must inform the application when an urgent pointer is received and one was not pending, or if the urgent pointer advances in the data stream. The TTE 20 will support this protocol by passing a message to the OASP 16 whenever it encounters urgent data, and pass a pointer to the last byte of urgent data as specified in RFC1122. Similarly a mechanism will be provided in the SendStream utility to set urgent mode and indicate the urgent mode offset as data is transmitted. The urgent mode offset is always computed to be the last byte of urgent data and is not necessarily contained within the segment that broadcasts the URG control bit. A segment is said to be in urgent mode until the last byte of urgent data is processed by the application responsible for interfacing to the TCP connection in question. The urgent pointer is broadcasted as an offset from the starting sequence number in which it was calculated., 307921=[0225] If the TTE 20 is to be used in insecure network environments, care must be taken to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in implementing the TCP state machine. This can be accomplished by surveying security information dissemination sources that track recently developed attacks. For example, sequence number attacks can be dealt with according to the recommendations made in RFC1948, entitled \u201cDefending Against Sequence Number Attacks,\u201d which is herein incorporated by reference. The state of a connection is maintained in its TCB entry, which is described in more detail below., 355237=[0289] The data structures used by the DLE will now be described in more detail, beginning with session, subscriber and transient structures. The DLE uses Session Context Blocks (SCBs) that each have control handles and the starting sequence number for the current entity to be parsed on the TCP session's (current) receive stream. Controls include the session's subscriber ID, stream ID, and where DLE should send the parsing results. For each of 251 subscriber-IDs (0 to at least 250), the DLE has base and limit pointers for the subscriber's writeable segment of DLE memory, a 10-bit count of GETOBJECTCMD messages, each being a permission to send an unsolicited parsing result for any of the subscriber's receive streams, and the head index of a \u201creceive buffer\u201d ring to hold command-\u201ctag\u201d values from the GETOBJECTCMD messages. For commands from the OASP, the tag is an index to the flight table in the CMP, which stores the PCI address for each receive buffer. For each subscriber number, the DLE statically allocates 4 k bytes of memory to hold a 1024-entry ring-type fifo of GetObject buffer tags. After a complete message (i.e., headers) arrives in stream memory, the DLE allocates a context block and a message buffer so the message can be processed. The DLE frees a context after storing the results in an OASP bulk-data buffer., 323540=[0252] The TIME_WAIT state is entered when the TTE is asked to perform an ACTIVE_CLOSE on a connection and sends the final ACK of the four-way handshake. The primary purpose of this state is to ensure that the other endpoint receives the ACK and does not retransmit its final FIN packet. It is undesirable for connections in the TCB to be maintained in that state by the TTE and consuming a TCB buffer, since a simple analysis shows that it would not be possible for the TTE to meet its performance target of 100,000 objects per second. The TIME_WAIT state has therefore been moved to the network processor. When a connection needs to transition to the TIME_WAIT state the TTE passes a message a TTE_UPDATE message to the network processor, and can then recover the TCB buffer for re-use. The network processor then becomes responsible for implanting the 2MSL counter. When a connection is in the TIME_WAIT state it ignores all incoming traffic on that connection by dropping it on the floor. This is critical to avoid Time-Wait Assassination (TWA) hazards, documented in RFC1337. There is one exception to the rule that all segments received by a connection in the TIME_WAIT state be dropped. Since acknowledgements are not guaranteed to be delivered in TCP, then a connection can receive a re-transmitted FIN in the TIME_WAIT state. This results when one end of a connection fails to get an ACK for its FIN, and retransmits the original FIN. In the above scenario the TCP protocol (RFC 793) states that the connection must ACK the retransmitted FIN and re-start its 2MSL counter. The responsibility to retransmit the ACK is a collaborative effort between the TTE and the network processor. The following steps are performed to ensure this functionality:, 150030=[0127] The virtual service command specifies a name for the virtual service (e-commerceNet), a virtual IP address (10.10.50.11) for the load balancer, a type of load balancing (HTTP), and a optional forwarding policy list (forwardingPolicyList). The VIP is the address to which DNS resolves URIs. Essentially, it is the address of the load balancer, and masks the individual addresses of the servers behind it. Network address translation (NAT) converts, on the outbound transmission, the server's IP address in response headers to the VIP when responding to the client., 321202=[0242] The main purpose of the TCP cache controller 56 is to provide the TTE with fast on-chip access to recently or soon-to-be-referenced pieces of state information necessary to process TCP flows. Another important function of the TCC is to insolate the DRAM Memory Controller (DMC) from seeing random sub-word read/write accesses. Since the DMC is optimized for block transfers with an 8-byte ECC code, sub-word writes can become very inefficient operations for it to service. The TCC accelerates operations to different types of data structures used by the TTE including TCB entries, TCB descriptors, and PQ descriptors. The TCC can support a fully associative 8 Kbyte write-back cache organized as 64-128 byte entries with an address space of 1024 Mbytes., 149884=[0126] VirtualService e-commerceNet 10.10.50.11 HTTP forwardingPolicyList \u201cimageForward defaultForward\u201d}",
