However, developments in Binding Theory since 1981 have presented significant challenges to the PRO Theorem.[6] For example, if PRO is ungoverned, then it must not be case-marked. However, in Icelandic, PRO appears to be case-marked, and is thus governed.[6] More recent research attempts to characterize PRO without reference to the PRO theorem.[3]}",

Since non-obligatory control occurs when movement is not permitted, it may be treated as an elsewhere case: little pro inserted as a last resort measure to rescue the derivation if an overt subject is missing.[10] (adapted from Hornstein 1999: 92) b. *Bill is impossible to win at roulette.
