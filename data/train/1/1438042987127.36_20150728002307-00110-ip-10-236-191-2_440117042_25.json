The Thomson Reuters/Michigan curve starts around 110 in early 2000, and the Conference Board curve starts slightly above 140. In late 2000, both curves begin a sharp decline, which generally continues, with moderate fluctuations, until early 2003, when the Conference Board curve temporarily drops to about 60, and the Thomson Reuters/Michigan curve reaches about 80. From mid-2003 through mid-2007, the Conference Board curve generally trends up and reaches about 110 in mid-2007, while the Thomson Reuters/Michigan curve generally fluctuates within a range of about 85 to 95. From mid-2007 through early 2009, the curves decline sharply, on net, with Conference Board reaching near 20 and Thomson Reuters/Michigan a bit below 60. The curves then increase through mid-2009 and level out, with some moderate fluctuation, a bit above 50 for Conference Board and around 70 for Thomson Reuters/Michigan. The last observation for the Conference Board curve (June) is about 53, while the last observation for the Thomson Reuters/Michigan curve (preliminary July) is about 67., 403705=Note: The data are drawn from a survey conducted monthly and are seasonally adjusted; the last observation is from the July 2010 survey, which covers June 2010.

For 2010, receipts and expenditures are for the 12 months ending in June, and GDP is the average of 2009:Q4 and 2010:Q1. Receipts and expenditures are on a unified-budget basis., 421262=Note: The data for debt are as of year-end; the observation for 2010 is an estimate.
