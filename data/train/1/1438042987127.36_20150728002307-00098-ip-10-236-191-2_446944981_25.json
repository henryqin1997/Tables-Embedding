            "PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER CHANGING SYSTEM AND METHOD - Systems and methods are provided for enabling a cardholder to authenticate and change a current PIN associated with a chip card using a chip card interface device (CCID) having a chip card input/output device configured for interacting with the chip card. A PIN entry device receives from the cardholder a current PIN, which is communicated to the chip card along with a verify command. The chip card compares the current PIN input by the cardholder with the PIN stored on the chip card. If the cardholder input is verified, the cardholder can input a desired new PIN. The CCID then communicates a locked PIN through a host to the issuing bank's backend system, which unlocks the PIN and stores the desired PIN. The backend system then creates a PIN change script including the new PIN and communicates the script to the chip card over the network. The chip card runs the script, which instructs the chip card to store the new PIN in place of the previous PIN.",
            "AUTHENTICATING A CHIP CARD INTERFACE DEVICE - A system is configured for authenticating a chip card interface device (CCID) during a transaction with the CCID. The system has a communication device configured for communicating with the CCID over a network and a processing device coupled with the communication device. The processing device is configured for receiving a transaction initiation communication from the CCID and instructing the communication device to communicate a request for authentication information including a random number to the CCID. The CCID encrypts the random number with a unique chip key (UCK) previously created with a master chip key (MCK). Then, the CCID communicates the encrypted random number to the system along with a serial number. The system recalculates the UCK using the serial number, encrypts a copy of the random number using the recalculated UCK and compares the encrypted copy with the encrypted random number received from the CCID to authenticate the CCID.",
            "PROTECTING DATA STORED IN A CHIP CARD INTERFACE DEVICE IN THE EVENT OF COMPROMISE - A chip card interface device (CCID) is configured for protecting data stored at the CCID in the event of a compromise. The CCID has a housing and a compromise detection system including one or more detection devices configured for detecting a compromise of the housing. The compromise detection system is configured for generating a detection signal indicating the detected compromise. A data protection system is coupled with the compromise detection system and includes a memory device and a processing device coupled with the compromise detection system. The processing device is for receiving the detection signal and erasing data stored on the memory device based on the detection signal in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the processing device also activates a locking function for rendering itself inoperable based on the detection signal.",
            "PERSONAL ENCRYPTION DEVICE - A method and system for securing a handheld computing device is described. A personal encryption device may be physically connected to a handheld computing device. Responsive to the connection, a main screen user interface may be displayed on a display of the handheld computing device. The main screen user interface may include at least one cryptography option for a user of the handheld computing device. A user-defined input representative of selection of a first cryptography option of the at least one cryptography option may be received, and at least one cryptography process associated with the selected first cryptography option may be implemented by the handheld computing device and personal encryption device. The cryptography options may include encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and digital signature verification."

A system and method may be used where the runtime processing is split between a host system and a target system. At the target device a test program uses a symbol not defined on the target device. A query is sent from the target device to a symbolic information source. The symbolic information source then provides the target device with information about the undefined symbol. The target device uses the information from the symbolic information source to complete the test program. 11-27-2014 Website \u00a9 2015 Advameg, Inc.",
