Palmer found Myers for a 15-yard strike on a 3rd-and-10 to move the ball to midfield before Derek Hagan reeled off a 17-yard gain on a short pass over the middle to get in field-goal range., 78625=After a couple of runs up the middle ran the clock down, Janikowski connected on the game-winner for Oakland, which avoided its first 0-3 start since starting 0-5 in 2006., 80071=The Steelers were held to just one first down and had to punt the ball back to Oakland after a 22-yard catch by Miller on a 3rd-and-9 was overturned on a review as he did not maintain control of the ball while hitting the ground, keeping it a 14-7 game with 10:25 left in the second quarter., 77721=Brown again had the ball punched out of his hands during a 20-yard catch-and- run on Pittsburgh's ensuing drive, but he was unable to regain possession this time and Oakland's Philip Wheeler recovered at the Raiders' 36-yard line, resulting in Janikowski's 32-yard field goal to tie the game at 31-31 with 6:30 left in the game.}",
