The Commission seeks to develop a flexible and streamlined regulatory framework that will encourage efficient, innovative uses of the spectrum and to allow various services to operate on an interference-protected basis. In doing so, it further seeks to adopt service rules that will allow for the deployment of the various radar applications in this band, both within and outside the U.S. The Commission takes this action in response to a petition for rulemaking filed by Robert Bosch, LLC (Bosch) and two petitions for reconsideration of the 2012 Vehicular Radar R&O., 43956=In this document the Commission implements certain changes to the rules governing the 700 MHz public safety narrowband spectrum (769-775/799-805 MHz). We eliminate the requirement for licensees to narrowband to 6.25 kHz technology by December 2016, thereby enabling licensees to extend the life of existing systems and providing public safety with greater flexibility in determining the optimal future use of the band. In addition, we revise and update the technical rules for the band to enhance interoperability and open up certain channels to new uses, and we release reserve spectrum to provide additional capacity, particularly for public safety licensees relocating to the 700 MHz band from the T-Band (470-512 MHz). These rule changes enhance the ability of public safety licensees to use this spectrum to protect the safety of life and property., 52759=Title 47 published on 2014-10-01, 52015=48 Stat. 1066, 52357=48 Stat. 1082, 52186=48 Stat. 1068, 23653=In this document, the Commission announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved, for a period of three years a non-substantive change to a currently approved information collection requirements contained in the regulations in the \u201cCommercial Operations in the 1695-1710 MHz, 1755-1780 MHz, and 2155-2180 MHz.\u201d The information collection requirement was approved on December 23, 2014 by OMB., 132726=The Federal Communications Commission published a document in the Federal Register of October 27, 2014 (79 FR 63883), regarding Petitions for Reconsideration filed of Action in a rulemaking proceeding.
