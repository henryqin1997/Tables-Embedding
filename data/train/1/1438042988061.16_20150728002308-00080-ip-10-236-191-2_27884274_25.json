    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{206696=Byron Buxton enters the 2014 season at the top prospect in all of baseball, according to\u00a0Baseball America, and he is the face of talented farm system in Minnesota that could make the Twins a dangerous team a few years from now. He's a legitimate five-tool talent and should be an All-Star for years to come once he arrives., 143703=The Yankees spent nearly $500 million this offseason to retool a roster that missed the playoffs for just the second time since 1994 last season. With that kind of spending comes some lofty expectations. and while they do look like an improved team, there are still a number of question marks and a loaded AL East to contend with., 169267=As the Cubs continue to rebuild, they have a big decision to make come July regarding ace right-hander Jeff Samardzija. He looked like a core piece of the rebuilding efforts with a breakout season in 2012, but he took a step back last year and is set to hit free agency at the end of 2014., 257127=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Bleacher Report, Inc.

Any commercial use or distribution without the express written consent of Getty Images is strictly prohibited., 169880=This survey was anonymous, but I'd be curious to know who thinks Jose Fernandez has a real chance of being traded come July and what type of return that person thinks the Marlins would get for him. I don't think there are enough prospects in the world for the Marlins to pull the trigger on dealing him right now., 169575=Chase Headley made a name for himself with a monster second half in 2012, but he regressed last season, and the San Diego Padres may have missed their chance to get a king's ransom for him. He's still a productive third baseman in a contract year, though, and should net a solid return., 138970=The Royals took a big step forward last year and made things interesting with a late-season push, and they look to have the best chance to be the surprise playoff team of 2014., 164114=Others Receiving One Vote (2.5%):\u00a0Jose Abreu, John Axford, Marlon Byrd, Shin-Soo Choo, Dan Haren, Tim Hudson, Omar Infante, Ubaldo Jimenez, Jhonny Peralta, Brian Roberts, Jose Valverde, 207248=Alongside him in the voting was the Cubs' top prospect, Javier Baez, who has serious power potential and perhaps the best bat speed in all of minor league baseball. He should make his debut at some point in 2014, and after he hit five home runs in spring training, an immediate impact is not out of the question., 148654=After a relatively disappointing first full season in 2012, Brandon Belt finally turned a corner in the second half last season, posting a .915 OPS after the All-Star break on his way to a 4.3 WAR for the season. He's carried that over to this season as well, as he currently leads the league with five home runs and looks poised for a huge season., 121350=With the additions of Prince Fielder and Shin-Soo Choo this offseason and a full season of August addition Alex Rios, the Rangers offense looked loaded once again entering this season, so it's not surprising to see them take the top spot here., 165359=Cruz got $750,000 more and he ranks 17th in all of baseball since the start of 2009 with 135 home runs. Sure, there were concerns with him coming off of a PED suspension, but the potential is still there for 30-plus home runs. He would be an absolute steal at $8 million if he puts up his pre-suspension numbers., 117005=The National League as a whole was the overwhelming favorite here, with 29 of the 40 voters selecting an NL team to win it all in 2014. Only four people selected the Red Sox to win the AL pennant, and three of those four have the defending champs repeating., 218694=It was Tampa Bay Rays ace David Price who first dubbed Giancarlo Stanton as \"Create-A-Player\" with a tweet prior to the 2013 season., 138757=There has been no shortage of surprise teams in the MLB recently, with the Orioles and Oakland Athletics making the playoffs in 2012 and the Cleveland Indians earning a wild-card spot last year., 178053=He's settled in at second base over the past couple years but remains one of the most versatile players in all of baseball. He provides some pop and some speed and hits for a decent average, and his 32.3 WAR since the start of 2009 is good for third in all of baseball., 139592=Only four people in the poll agreed with me on this one. After winning 83 games and leading the NL in runs scored in 2012, the Brewers took a big step back last season and lost 88 games., 159801=That earned him a four-year, $50 million contract from the pitching-starved Baltimore Orioles, who also had to cough up draft pick compensation in the deal. He's in his age-30 season and was no doubt one of the top arms on the market, but there is certainly a good chance he regresses to his 2012 form., 170323=The Padres held extension talks with Headley briefly this offseason, but nothing ever came of it, and it seems fairly certain that he'll be playing elsewhere in 2015. It's just a matter of whether they will be able to get a good enough return come July or if they'll opt to hold onto him and make a qualifying offer.}",

I opted not to vote in the poll, because I did not want to influence the results and 40 was a nice, round number. However, included on each slide is an explanation of what my choice would've been. What follows is a look at how the voting shook out on everything from Favorite Player to Watch to Best Facial Hair, as well as some analysis on the top vote-getters. With that in mind, we decided to do the same thing here at Bleacher Report, but with a pool of 40 of our MLB writers instead.\u00a0I crafted a 25-question poll with a mixture of team- and player-specific questions. Each year, a number of different media outlets publish an MLB player survey in which they ask current players for their",
    "textAfterTable": "It is somewhat surprising to see the Washington Nationals so close behind in the voting, though, after the disappointing season they turned in last year. That said, they still look as good as any team in baseball on paper and have no doubt improved over last year with the addition of Doug Fister. The Atlanta Braves and San Francisco Giants are certainly in the mix to contend as well, though it would be something of an upset if they were to come away with the NL pennant. \u00a0 My Choice:\u00a0St. Louis Cardinals The Cardinals bested the Dodgers in the NLCS last year, and with the addition of Jhonny Peralta and another year of experience for their young players, they look like the better team once again. The biggest chip in their favor is their incredible depth, as there may be no team better positioned to deal with the inevitable injuries that pop up over the course of a season than the Cardinals. \u00ab Prev 3 of 28 Next \u00bb AL Pennant Winner Carlos Osorio",
