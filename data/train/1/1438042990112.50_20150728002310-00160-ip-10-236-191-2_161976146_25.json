Majority of questions from general studies and a few question from maths+reasoning. Topicwise breakup is somewhat similar to UPSC prelims of early 2000 -in the sense that major emphasis used to be on History and Geography. Question difficulty level bit easier than SSC CGL. But there is a sharp difference: SSC-CGL gives special focus on science, this one doesn\u2019t. Economy is entirely current affairs based. History is GK based. Maths-reasoning is very basic level. (Walk in the park compared to CGL/IBPS). Anyways, let\u2019s see how to approach individual topics: History Can be further classified into: Ancient Buddhism, Jainism, Harappa, Asoka, Maurya etc Medieval Delhi sultanate, Mughals etc. Modern British raj, freedom struggle. Culture Various religion, caves, paintings, classical music, dance In the review officer, the History MCQs are Mostly GK type. In",
