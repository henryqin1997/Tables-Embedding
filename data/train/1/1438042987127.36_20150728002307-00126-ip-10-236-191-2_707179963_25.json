To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, management made estimates and judgments about future cash flows, as well as revenue, cost of sales, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and net working capital based on assumptions that are consistent with the long-range plans used to manage the business. Based on the results of the impairment analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit was determined to exceed the respective carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result, no goodwill impairment existed in any of its reporting units at June\u00a030, 2004 and no events have occurred or circumstances changed that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of its reporting units below the carrying amounts as of December\u00a031, 2004., 130080=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The UTOS system transmits natural gas from offshore platforms to other pipelines onshore for further delivery.

The, 470247=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several major oil sands projects are scheduled for completion over the next few years, including expansions of existing oil sands projects, as well as new projects. The two original oil sands producers, Suncor and Syncrude, are both constructing projects to increase production by the end of 2005 by approximately 150,000 Bpd of additional supply. In addition to the Alberta oil sands, Canada has substantial conventional crude oil resources. Conventional crude oil production will remain sensitive to the price of crude oil and the level of crude oil drilling activity. For a complete discussion of supply and demand for crude oil, please see \"Items 1.\u00a0& 2. Business and Properties.\", 149194=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In December\u00a02002, Canada ratified the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 6% below 1990 levels. The Partnership and Enbridge are assessing and evaluating the Canadian federal government's approach to implementation. Until these plans become certain, we will not be able to quantify the impact, if any, of the Kyoto Protocol on our operations. We are encouraged by reactions by western Canadian crude oil producers to Kyoto, particularly their commitment to oil sands development, which supports the outlook for the sustainability of crude oil supplies for the Lakehead system., 375438=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0High natural gas prices positively impacted volumes on our gathering and processing systems. This positive impact was compounded by favorable processing economics in 2004. The majority of our operating income is derived from fee-based contracts, percentage of index or percentage of proceeds contracts. However, a portion of our operating income is derived from keep-whole processing of natural gas. This contract structure requires us to process natural gas at times when it may not be economical to do so. This can happen when natural gas prices are unusually high or natural gas liquids prices are unusually low. During 2004, natural gas prices were high but were more than offset by favorable NGL prices., 200981=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The OPA was enacted in 1990 and amends parts of the CWA and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to oil spills. Under the OPA, we could be subject to strict, joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill from our facilities into navigable waters, along shorelines or in an exclusive economic zone of the United States. The OPA also imposes certain spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements for many of our non-pipeline facilities, such as the preparation of detailed oil spill emergency response plans and the construction of dikes or other containment structures to prevent contamination of navigable or other waters in the event of an oil overflow, rupture or leak. For our liquid pipeline facilities, the OPA imposes requirements for emergency plans to be prepared, submitted and approved by the DOT. For our non-transportation facilities, such as storage tanks that are not integral to pipeline transportation system, the OPA regulations are promulgated by the EPA. We believe we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations., 558531=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Partnership has adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our senior financial officers, including the principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer of Enbridge Management. A copy of the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers is available on our website at www.enbridgepartners.com and is included herein as Exhibit\u00a014.1. We intend to post on our website any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers. Additionally, this material is available in print, free of charge, to any person who requests the information. Persons wishing to obtain this printed material should submit a request to Corporate Secretary, c/o Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P., 1100 Louisiana, Suite 3300, Houston, TX 77002., 399836=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On June\u00a030, 2003, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC. Under this shelf, we may offer and sell debt securities or Class\u00a0A common units up to a total of $1.5\u00a0billion, with the amount, price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale. We expect to use the net proceeds from any future sales of securities under the universal shelf registration statement for operations and for other general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions of businesses or assets. We have effected the following financing transactions using our registration statement:, 384530=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Marketing segment was established upon our acquisition of the Midcoast system on October\u00a017, 2002, and its results of operations are included in our results since that date. The, 420966=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net cash provided by operating activities was $245.4\u00a0million in 2004 compared with $148.2\u00a0million in 2003. Improved operating cash flow was the result of net income contributions from the North Texas and Mid-Continent assets, as well as improved results from our existing assets. The remaining changes in cash from operating activities were due to changes in the operating assets and liabilities from increased natural gas prices in 2004, an increase in natural gas and liquids inventory and general timing differences in the collection on and payment of our current accounts., 925884=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The primary strategy of the Partnership is to grow cash distributions through the profitable expansion of existing assets and through development and acquisition of complementary businesses with similar risk profiles to the Partnership's current business. During 2004, 2003 and 2002 the Partnership completed acquisitions, each of which were accounted for using the purchase method, and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair market values as of the date of purchase. The results of operations from these acquisitions are included in earnings from the effective date of the acquisition., 935453=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On December\u00a031, 2003, the Partnership acquired natural gas gathering and processing assets in north Texas. The gathering system, referred to as the North Texas system, primarily serves the Fort Worth Basin, including the Barnett Shale producing zone, and is complementary to the Partnership's existing natural gas systems in the area. The assets were purchased for cash of $249.6\u00a0million, which includes the buyout of a capital lease of $1.9\u00a0million and transaction costs of $1.7\u00a0million. The purchase was funded with borrowings under the Partnership's 364-day revolving credit facility and Three-year term credit facility. The value allocated to the assets was determined by an independent appraisal. Goodwill associated with the acquisition was $23.8\u00a0million, and is allocated entirely to the Natural Gas segment. Intangible assets acquired of $48.1\u00a0million represent the fair value associated with the natural gas supply opportunities present in the Barnett Shale producing zone that will be shipped through the North Texas system and is recorded in the Natural Gas segment. Of the $2.7\u00a0million of environmental liabilities assumed, $0.5\u00a0million are included in Accounts payable and other and $2.2\u00a0million are included in environmental liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December\u00a031, 2003., 934000=Other 2004 Acquisitions, 555516=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enbridge Management has an Audit, Finance\u00a0& Risk Committee (the \"Audit Committee\") comprised of four board members who are independent as the term is used in Section\u00a010A of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. None of these members are relying upon any exemptions from the foregoing independence requirements. The members of the Audit Committee are M.O. Hesse, E.C. Hambrook, G.K. Petty and J.A. Connelly. The Audit Committee provides independent oversight with respect to our internal controls, accounting policies, financial reporting, internal audit function and the report of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also reviews the scope and quality, including the independence and objectivity of the independent and internal auditors and the fees paid for both audit and non-audit work and makes recommendations concerning audit matters, including the engagement of the independent auditors, to the Board of Directors., 223357=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On February\u00a015, 2005, the last reported sales price of our Class\u00a0A common units on the NYSE was $54.40. At February\u00a015, 2005, there were approximately 90,000 Class\u00a0A common unitholders, of which there were approximately 2,000 registered Class\u00a0A common unitholders of record. There is no established public trading market for our Class\u00a0B common units, all of which are held by the General Partner, or our i-units, all of which are held by Enbridge Management., 426330=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During 2004, working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, improved by $249.3\u00a0million to $69.5\u00a0million, compared with a deficit of $179.8\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2003. This improvement was primarily due to a reduction in current maturities and short-term debt related to our Senior Credit Facilities. We amended our multi-year revolving credit facility and terminated our 364-day revolving credit facility on April\u00a026, 2004. The amended facility consists of a $600.0\u00a0million Three-year term credit facility which matures in 2007., 344316=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Liquids segment accounted for $139.1\u00a0million of operating income, or 59% of our consolidated operating income in 2004. This was an increase of $14.6\u00a0million (12%) over 2003 Liquids operating income. The primary driver of the increase in 2004 was our newly acquired Mid-Continent system, which contributed $13.7\u00a0million of operating income to the Liquids segment., 354007=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depreciation expense was lower in 2003 by $5.3\u00a0million compared with 2002. The decrease was due to revised depreciation rates effective January\u00a01, 2003 on the Lakehead system of $13.4\u00a0million, offset by depreciation on new facilities placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2002 and throughout 2003 of $8.1\u00a0million. The reduction in depreciation rates pursuant to a third party study, better represents the expected remaining service life of the Lakehead system., 53058=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beginning in 2001, we have diversified geographically and operationally through acquisitions of a crude oil gathering and transportation system and of natural gas gathering, treating, processing and transmission systems. These acquisitions materially increased the size and diversity of our business. On, 1032515=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scheduled maturities of outstanding external third party debt, excluding the market value of interest rate swaps, at December\u00a031, 2004, are summarized as follows:, 344784=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Segment operating revenues increased by $65.1\u00a0million (19%) in 2004 compared with 2003, largely due to a $36.7\u00a0million contribution from our Mid-Continent system. Operating revenues from our Lakehead system increased $22.9 (7%), mostly due to increased deliveries. Deliveries on our Lakehead system increased 5% during 2004, primarily from increased production of western Canadian crude oil transported on that system. Overall, production of western Canadian crude oil increased in the last two years mainly due to the start up of new oil sands projects in the province of Alberta. These latest oil sands projects differ from conventional oil production in two ways. First, oil sands deposits are a mixture of bitumen, water, sand and clay. As a result, oil production takes the form of either mining the oil sands from subsurface deposits and separating out the water, sand and clay components, or, if the deposits are deeper, heating the reservoir sufficiently to flow the pure bitumen to the surface. Second, the bitumen requires either upgrading or blending prior to being sent to market. The upgrading process partially refines the bitumen into a crude stream, which can be readily refined by most conventional refineries. This product is known as synthetic crude oil. During 2004, crude oil production increased in western Canada, primarily due to the start up of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (\"AOSP\") in June\u00a02003. The AOSP is owned by Shell Canada Limited, Chevron Canada Limited and Western Oil Sands L.P., and consists of oil sands mining and bitumen extraction operations with a current capacity of 155,000 Bpd. 2004 deliveries on our Lakehead system reflect a full year's impact from this new source of supply. Operating revenues on our North Dakota system also increased in 2004 by $5.5\u00a0million (37%), primarily due to an increase in transportation of longer-haul, higher margin barrels resulting from improved production in Montana., 1242533=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On January\u00a024, 2005, the Partnership's Board of Directors declared a distribution payable on February\u00a014, 2005, to unitholders of record as of February\u00a03, 2005, of our available cash of $61.0\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2004, or $0.925 per common unit. Of this distribution, $50.7\u00a0million was paid in cash, $10.1\u00a0million was distributed in i-units to i-unit holders and $0.2\u00a0million was retained from the General Partner in respect of this i-unit distribution., 478758=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October\u00a08, 2004, the FERC issued an Order on Remand (\"Remand Order\") relating to initial rates on our Kansas Pipeline System (\"KPC\") for the period of time between December\u00a01997 and November\u00a02002. We acquired KPC on October\u00a017, 2002. The Remand Order was issued in response to a United States Court of Appeals ruling in August\u00a02003 requiring the FERC to address the issue of appropriate rate refunds, if any, with respect to KPC's initial rates. In the Remand Order, the FERC found that the proper initial rates are lower than the rates previously charged to customers pending resolution of this contested rate case. In accordance with the FERC's findings, any difference between what was collected and these revised initial Section\u00a07 rates for the period of time between December\u00a01997 and November\u00a02002, plus interest compounded quarterly, is subject to refund., 560986=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table sets forth the annual, long-term and other compensation for all services provided in all capacities to Enbridge Management and the Partnership for the fiscal years ended December\u00a031, 2004, 2003 and 2002, of the Chief Executive Officer and four of our other executive officers with the highest salary and bonus compensation in the 2004 fiscal year (the \"Named Executive Officers\"). The Partnership bears an allocable portion of these officers' total compensation that is based on the approximate percentage of time each of these officers devote to Enbridge Management and the Partnership. The other affiliates of Enbridge, to whom these officers also render services, bear the remainder of the compensation expenses of these officers., 73698=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remaining established conventional oil reserves in Western Canada were estimated to be approximately 5\u00a0billion barrels at the end of 2003. During 2003, approximately 50% of conventional production was replaced with reserve additions. Remaining established reserves from oil sands currently stand at approximately 174\u00a0billion barrels. Combined conventional and oil sands established reserves of approximately 179\u00a0billion barrels compares with Saudi Arabia's proved reserves of approximately 260\u00a0billion barrels., 353506=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Operating and administrative expenses decreased by $0.6\u00a0million to $104.1\u00a0million in 2003 from $104.7\u00a0million in 2002. We experienced higher leak clean-up and remediation costs related to two leaks in Minnesota during 2003, as well as higher workforce costs related to benefits. These increases were offset by lower oil measurement expenses and more labor costs capitalized to construction projects., 74315=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Alberta government, an estimated $23\u00a0billion has been spent on oil sands development from 1996 through 2003. The Alberta government further estimates that approximately $60\u00a0billion may be spent by 2013, including approximately $11\u00a0billion in maintenance capital on existing projects. This estimate includes all announced and planned projects in the oil sands. While it is unlikely that all projects will proceed as planned, the magnitude of the potential is noteworthy. Separately, the Alberta government's utility board estimates future production from the oil sands will increase by, 729833=Houston, Texas February\u00a025, 2005, 349171=During 2004, oil measurement losses increased due to the impact of higher crude oil prices and increased volumes on the system, which contributed to the physical losses. Also included in oil measurement losses was an adjustment to the degradation loss of approximately $3.4\u00a0million. This was the result of refinements in the oil measurement loss estimation process in valuing different types of crude on station lines. The refinements were the result of engineering studies completed in the fourth quarter of 2004., 944268=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following summarized unaudited Pro Forma Financial information for each of the years ended December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003 assumes the North Texas and Mid-Continent acquisitions described above occurred as of January\u00a01, 2003. These unaudited Pro Forma financial results have been prepared for comparative purposes only. These unaudited Pro Forma financial results may not be indicative of the results that would have occurred if the Partnership had completed the acquisitions as of January\u00a01, 2003 or the results that will be attained in the future., 544450=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0J.A. Connelly was elected a director of the General Partner in January\u00a02003 and serves as the Chairman of its Audit, Finance\u00a0& Risk Committee.

In 2004, PADD II imported 2.9\u00a0million barrels per day from outside of the PADD II region. The Enbridge system supplied roughly 1\u00a0million barrels per day of crude from Canada leaving 1.9\u00a0million barrels per day imported from PADD III and offshore sources. We expect the gap between local supply and demand for crude oil in PADD II to continue to widen, encouraging imports of crude oil from Canada, PADD III and foreign sources., 124908=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Anadarko system is located within the Anadarko Basin. Within that basin, recent growth is occurring in the Granite Wash play, particularly in Hemphill and Wheeler Counties, Texas. We are in the process of constructing our Zybach Processing Plant and related facilities to accommodate volume growth from this new drilling. Completion is anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2005 with initial capacity of 100 MMcf/d, with an additional expansion of 50 MMcf/d planned for startup late in the third quarter of 2005., 112215=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Mid-Continent system is comprised of: the Ozark Pipeline, the West Tulsa pipeline and storage terminals at Cushing and El Dorado, Kansas. These assets were acquired in the first quarter of 2004. The Ozark pipeline transports crude oil from Cushing to Wood River where Ozark delivers to ConocoPhillips' Wood River refinery and interconnects with the WoodPat Pipeline, owned by Marathon Ashland Pipeline L.L.C., and the Wood River Pipeline, operated by Koch Pipeline L.P. The West Tulsa pipeline moves crude oil from Cushing to Tulsa, Oklahoma where it delivers to Sinclair Oil Corporation's Tulsa refinery., 1093922=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the year ended December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003 we converted interest payable related to loans from the General Partner and affiliates in the amount of $9.0\u00a0million and $16.1\u00a0million, respectively, into long-term debt to the General Partner and affiliates., 452020=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In January\u00a02004, we issued $200.0\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.0% Senior Notes due 2009 in a public offering, from which we received net proceeds of $198.3\u00a0million. We used the proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding debt under bank credit facilities., 161247=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since 1995, FERC regulated liquid petroleum pipelines have been generally subject to an indexed ceiling rate methodology under which the annual change in the ceiling rate is the annual change in the, 451551=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In December\u00a02004, we issued $200.0\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.35% Senior Notes due 2014 and $100.0\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.30% Senior Notes due 2034 in a public offering, from which we received net proceeds of $297.1\u00a0million. We used the proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding debt under bank credit facilities., 1093351=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Partnership has a note payable with an affiliate of Enbridge that totaled $142.1\u00a0million and $133.1\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, which matures in 2007. The interest rate is 6.60% as of December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003., 467547=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the first quarter of 2005, we plan to establish a $600\u00a0million commercial paper program to be backstopped by our $600\u00a0million Three-year term credit facility. We expect to reduce our short-term borrowing costs by borrowing in the commercial paper market and repaying all outstanding balances under our $600\u00a0million Three-year term credit facility. Our Three-year term credit facility will remain undrawn and available to backstop our commercial paper program. The commercial paper program will not contain any clauses or ratings triggers that would restrict borrowing under the facility. The covenants include a 5.25x maximum Debt/EBITDA (5.00x after September\u00a02005) leverage test and 2.75x EBITDA/Interest coverage test. We have received credit ratings of A-2 and P-2 by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively, on our commercial paper program., 78125=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The AOSP, owned by Shell Canada Limited (60%), Chevron Canada Limited (20%) and Western Oil Sands L.P. (20%), is another oil sands project that reached full production capacity in 2004. Over the next three years, AOSP is planning on a number of de-bottlenecking programs to increase production from 155,000 Bpd to between 180,000 and 200,000 Bpd. On October\u00a019, 2004, a pump failure occurred at AOSP's Scotford upgrader site causing a partial shutdown of the project. Subsequent to the pump failure, during the restart of the affected facilities, a leak from the cooling apparatus was detected resulting in a further delay to the restart of the facilities. AOSP expects production to be restored during the first quarter of 2005., 75383=nearly 1.1\u00a0million barrels per day by 2013 based on a subset of currently approved applications and announced expansions., 186987=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under a tariff agreement approved by the FERC in 1998, we implemented a tariff surcharge for the Terrace expansion program of approximately $0.013 per barrel for light crude oil from the Canadian border to Chicago. On April\u00a01, 2001, pursuant to an agreement between the Partnership and Enbridge Pipelines, our share of the surcharge was increased to $0.026 per barrel. This surcharge was in effect until April\u00a01, 2004, when the surcharge to us changed to $0.007 per barrel. The new tariff is expected to be in effect for the next six years, after which time our tariff will return to $0.013 per barrel through 2013, the term of the agreement., 373321=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compared with 2003, average daily volumes on our major Natural Gas systems increased 26% in 2004, mostly due to the contribution of our North Texas system from the acquisition date of December\u00a031, 2003. Our North Texas system contributed $22.9\u00a0million to operating income in 2004, which was consistent with our expectations for the first year of ownership., 422342=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net cash used in our investing activities was $419.1\u00a0million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2004, compared with $431.0\u00a0million for the prior year. The $11.9\u00a0million decrease in funds utilized in investing activities was primarily attributable to two items:, 559452=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We also have a Statement of Business Conduct applicable to all of our employees, officers and directors. A copy of the Statement of Business Conduct is available on our website at www.enbridgepartners.com. We intend to post on our website any amendments to or waivers of our Statement of Business Conduct. Additionally, this material is available in print, free of charge, to any person who requests the information.

In 2004, Enbridge began allocating to us the compensation expense it recognized in connection with recording the fair value of its outstanding stock options granted to certain of our officers, including the Named Executive Officers. Prior to 2004, we were not allocated any expense associated with stock option grants. The stock options are granted to the Named Executive Officers pursuant to the Enbridge Incentive Stock Option Plan, which is a long-term incentive plan administered by the Human Resources\u00a0& Compensation Committee of Enbridge. The stock option grants are denominated in Canadian dollars. The following three tables set forth information concerning options granted and exercised during 2004 by the Named Executive Officers under the Enbridge stock option plans:, 1092822=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Partnership also purchases natural gas from Enbridge and its affiliates for sale to third parties at market prices on the date of purchase. Included in the results for the twelve months ending December\u00a031, 2004, 2003 and 2002, are cost of natural gas expenses of $6.9\u00a0million, $1.2\u00a0million and $0.1\u00a0million, respectively, relating to these purchases., 380236=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Natural Gas segment accounted for $63.6\u00a0million, or 33% of consolidated operating income in 2003. This was an increase of $39.5 (164%) over 2002 Natural Gas operating income. Our Natural Gas segment results of operations improved in 2003 due to the full year impact of the Midcoast assets and increased volume of natural gas on the East Texas system., 466922=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In February\u00a02005, we issued 2,506,500\u00a0million Class\u00a0A common units at $49.875 per unit, which generated proceeds, net of offering expenses, of approximately $124.9\u00a0million. In addition, the General Partner contributed $2.7\u00a0million to the Partnership to maintain its 2% general partner interest in the Partnership. Proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under our Three-year term credit facility., 204210=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Site Remediation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We own and operate a number of pipelines, gathering systems, storage facilities and processing facilities that have been used to transport, distribute, store and process crude oil, natural gas and other petroleum products. We or our predecessors have operated certain facilities, including the Lakehead system since 1950. Many of our other facilities were previously owned and operated by third parties whose handling, disposal and release of petroleum and waste materials were not under our control. The age of the facilities, combined with the past operating and waste disposal practices, which were standard for the industry and regulatory regime at the time, have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination at some facilities due to historical spills and releases. Such contamination is not unusual within the natural gas and petroleum industry. Historical contamination found on, under or originating from our properties may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws as described above. Under these laws, we could incur substantial expense to remediate such contamination, including contamination caused by prior owners and operators. In addition, Enbridge Management, as the entity with managerial responsibility for us, could also be liable for such costs to the extent that we are unable to fulfill our obligations. We have conducted site investigations at some of our facilities to assess historical environmental issues, and we are currently addressing soil and, 598679=outstanding stock units attributable to our executive officers that participate in the PSU Plan are allocated to us and expensed in our consolidated statements of income. The following table sets forth the grants made to the Named Executive Officers during 2004 pursuant to the PSU Plan:, 553790=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section\u00a016(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and 10% beneficial owners to file with the SEC, reports of ownership and changes in ownership of our equity securities and to furnish us with copies of all reports filed. Based solely on the review of the reports furnished to us, we believe that, during fiscal year 2004, all Section\u00a016(a) filing requirements applicable to Enbridge Management's directors, officers, and greater than 10% beneficial owners were met., 548903=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0L.A. Zupan was elected Vice President, Liquids Transportation Operations of the General Partner in July\u00a02004. Prior to that he has served as Vice President, Development\u00a0& Services for Enbridge Pipelines since 2000 and prior to that as Director, Information Technology., 300653=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the year ended December\u00a031, 2004, we recognized losses of $3.5\u00a0million in the Consolidated Statement of Income, as part of the Cost of Natural Gas balance of the Marketing and Natural Gas segments. The fair value of the basis swaps at December\u00a031, 2004, is a payable of $3.5\u00a0million, and is included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as part of the Deferred Credits balance. These losses resulted from the negative change in market value of these basis swap hedging portfolio activities. At that date, we had a limited number of basis swap transactions that extend beyond December\u00a031, 2005., 50615=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The General Partner receives quarterly cash distributions from its limited partner interests. In addition, it also receives an incentive distribution from us for being our general partner. This incentive distribution is calculated in increments based on the amount by which quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed specified target levels as set forth in our Partnership Agreement. These incentive distributions can reach a maximum of 50% of all quarterly distributions to unitholders for target levels greater than $0.99 per Class\u00a0A and B common units and i-units. Including both its general and limited partner interests in us, at the 2004 distribution level, the General Partner received approximately 19% of all quarterly distributions paid during 2004, of which 12% was attributable to its general partner interest and 7% was attributable to its limited partner interest., 514562=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We enter into natural gas derivative transactions in order to hedge the forecasted purchases or sales of natural gas. The following table details the outstanding derivatives at December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003:, 1159447=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At December\u00a031, 2004, no material credit risk exposure existed as the Partnership enters into financial instruments only with credit worthy institutions that possess investment grade ratings., 648549=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For purposes of computing the total retirement benefit of the Named Executive Officers, the following table sets forth the service accrued prior to January\u00a01, 2000, (\"Pre 2000 Service\") and service accrued after December\u00a031, 1999 (\"Post 1999 Service\") by the Named Executive Officers at December\u00a031, 2004. These figures include the additional service mentioned in the previous paragraph., 383521=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As anticipated, certain customer contracts on the AlaTenn system representing approximately 20% of its capacity terminated during 2003 and were not renewed by the customers. We are exploring alternative customer connections to increase the utilization of this system. High natural gas prices have impacted the anticipated development of increased natural gas demand expected in the Tennessee River Valley area and are a factor in lower utilization of our Bamagas system. This system connects to two new natural gas fueled power plants owned by third parties. Bamagas earns a base return whether the system is used or not because a significant portion of its capacity is contracted on a take-or-pay basis. Nonetheless, increased earnings cannot be realized until the power plants or other facilities transport more natural gas than their contracted take-or-pay levels., 898720=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Partnership extinguishes liabilities when a creditor has relieved the Partnership of the obligation, which occurs when the Partnership's financial institution honors a check that the creditor has presented for payment. As such, included in Accounts Payable and Other are obligations for which the Partnership has issued check payments that have not yet been presented to the financial institution of approximately $25.3\u00a0million and $11.9\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, respectively., 717950=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Copies of Exhibits may be obtained upon written request of any Unitholder to Investor Relations, Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P., 1100 Louisiana, Suite\u00a03300, Houston, Texas 77002., 6618=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The aggregate market value of the Registrant's Class\u00a0A Common Units held by non-affiliates computed by reference to the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average bid and asked price of such common equity, as of June\u00a030, 2004, was $1,880,527,004., 552175=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0J.L.

Prior to that time, she served as Chief Accountant of the General Partner from October\u00a01999 to April\u00a02003., 550008=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A.D. Meyer was elected Vice President, Liquids Transportation Technology, of the General Partner in July\u00a02003. He also continues to serve as Vice President, Technology, Enbridge Pipelines since his appointment in July\u00a01999. Prior to that time he served as President, Enbridge Pipelines (Athabasca)\u00a0Inc. from October\u00a01997 to July\u00a01999 and as Vice President, Liquids Marketing with Enbridge for the same period., 373774=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our East Texas system includes the combined results of the systems previously referred to as East Texas and Northeast Texas. Early in 2004, we completed projects that allowed for the operation of these assets as one integrated system, now referred to as the \"East Texas system.\" Comparative results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation., 382992=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Volumes on the UTOS system decreased 12% in 2003, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. This decrease is attributable to both general decline associated with volumes received into the UTOS system and stricter enforcement of gas quality specifications by pipelines downstream of the UTOS Pipeline. The full year impact to revenue in 2003 was less than $0.2\u00a0million if these 2003 volumes had remained consistent with the 2002 volumes., 192393=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The DOT has issued recent rules on requirements to submit maps, additional reports and enhance operator personnel qualification programs. We anticipate new rules regulating pipeline security, contractor drug testing, inspection, public awareness programs and annual information reporting. The 2002 amendments of the Act also called for expanded regulations for qualification of workers performing safety-related tasks on pipelines, which management expects to be enacted by incorporation of an industry consensus standard currently under development. Management has incorporated many of the anticipated new requirements into procedures and budgets and, while we expect to incur higher regulatory compliance costs, the increase is not expected to be material. Additionally, revised regulations are anticipated that may impose new federal mandates on certain non-DOT jurisdictional pipelines currently classified as \"rural gathering lines.\" Pending specific proposed regulations, we are not certain of the effect or costs that the new requirements may have on our operations., 51588=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enbridge Management is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on May\u00a014, 2002. On October\u00a017, 2002, Enbridge Management issued 7,450,000 Listed Shares to the public and 1,550,000 Listed Shares to the General Partner for cash. It used the net proceeds of the offering of approximately $330.8\u00a0million, based on the public offering price of $39.00 per share, to purchase 9,000,000 i-units from the Partnership, compensate Enbridge for agreeing to certain purchase provisions and a tax indemnification agreement and pay costs of the offering. Enbridge Management's shares represent limited liability company interests and are traded on the NYSE under the symbol \"EEQ.\" Enbridge Management does not receive quarterly distributions of cash on these i-units from the Partnership; instead, the number of i-units owned by Enbridge Management increases automatically under the Partnership's partnership agreement. Enbridge Management's principal activity is managing the business and affairs of the Partnership and our subsidiaries. Under a Delegation of Control Agreement, the General Partner delegated substantially all of its power and authority to manage our business and affairs to Enbridge Management. The General Partner, through its direct ownership of the voting shares of Enbridge Management, elects all of the directors of Enbridge Management., 186514=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rates at December\u00a031, 2004 for medium and heavy crude oils are higher, and those for NGLs are lower than the rates set forth in the table to compensate us for differences in the costs of shipping different types and grades of liquid hydrocarbons. We periodically adjust our tariff rates as allowed under the FERC's indexing methodology and the tariff agreement described below., 95042=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table sets forth Lakehead system average deliveries per day and barrel miles for each of the five-year periods ended December\u00a031, 2004., 346850=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Operating and administrative expenses for the Liquids segment increased by $24.8\u00a0million (24%) in 2004 compared with 2003, mostly due to our new Mid-Continent system, which had operating and administrative expenses of $13.4\u00a0million. Operating and administrative expenses on our Lakehead system increased by $10.7\u00a0million (11%). This increase was attributable primarily to three factors:, 87393=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Competition.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Lakehead system, along with the Enbridge system, is the main crude oil export route from the WCSB. WCSB production in excess of western Canadian demand moves on existing pipelines into the Midwest area of the United States (PADD II), the Rocky Mountain states (PADD IV), and the Anacortes area of Washington State (PADD V). In each of these areas, WCSB crude competes with local and imported crude oil to feed refineries to produce refined products (mainly gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel). As local crude production declines and refineries demand more imported crude in each PADD, imports from the WCSB increase. The latest data available for 2004 shows that, PADD II demanded 3.3\u00a0million Bpd while producing 435,000 Bpd, thus importing 2.9\u00a0million Bpd. For the first nine months of 2004, PADD II imported approximately 1\u00a0million Bpd of crude from Canada. The remaining 1.9\u00a0million Bpd was imported from PADD III and offshore sources through the U.S. Gulf Coast. Of the crude oil imported from Canada, actual volumes transported on the Lakehead system averaged 965,000 Bpd. Deliveries on the Lakehead system to PADD II increased by approximately 60,000 Bpd in 2004, a 6% increase over 2003 volumes. In 2004, the Lakehead system delivered 1.42\u00a0million Bpd, meeting approximately 83\u00a0percent of Minnesota refinery needs; 57\u00a0percent of the demand in the greater Chicago area; and 61\u00a0percent of Ontario's refinery demand., 113707=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Customers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Mid-Continent system operates under month-to-month transportation arrangements and both long-term and spot storage arrangements with its shippers. During 2004, 20 shippers tendered crude oil for service by the Mid-Continent system. These customers include integrated oil companies, independent oil producers, refiners and marketers. Following our acquisition of the Mid-Continent system, average daily deliveries on the system were 241,000 Bpd for 2004. For 2005, we expect deliveries to be approximately 230,000 Bpd., 424864=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net cash provided by financing activities was $187.6\u00a0million in 2004, compared with $286.9\u00a0million in 2003. The decrease of $99.3\u00a0million from 2003 is primarily due to fewer unit offerings during 2004 and an increase in our distributions to partners in 2004.

As a result, many expansions and extensions have been made on three of our main gathering and processing systems in Texas, including well connects, processing plant re-activations, new plant construction, added compression and new pipelines. We further enhanced several of our systems during 2004 with purchases of connected gathering lines and a small processing plant. In addition, during January\u00a02005 we purchased additional natural gas gathering and processing assets in North Texas from Devon Energy Corporation, which will integrate well with our existing North Texas assets., 550997=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0D.V.

Over the next two years, synthetic production capacity is expected to increase by nearly 200,000 Bpd at the existing plants. Syncrude, one of the original oil sands producers in northern Alberta, is expected to complete their Stage 3 expansion later in 2005, increasing production capacity to 350,000 Bpd from current capacity of 240,000 Bpd. Suncor, the other original oil sands producer in northern Alberta, is undertaking an expansion of their existing plant both at their upgrader and their SAGD production facility. Production capacity is expected to grow from 225,000 Bpd to 260,000 Bpd by the end of 2005. On January\u00a04, 2005, Suncor experienced a fire at their upgrader site reducing production by almost half to approximately 110,000 Bpd. The impact of this incident on the in-service date of their expansion is not known, although Suncor has stated that this incident will not impact the expansion, and that capital spending and work plans will proceed as planned., 549617=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T.L.

The i-units are a separate class of our limited partner interests. All of our i-units are owned by Enbridge Management and are not publicly traded. Enbridge Management's limited liability company agreement provides that the number of all of its outstanding shares, including the voting shares owned by the General Partner, at all times will equal the number of i-units that it owns. Through the combined effect of the provisions in the Partnership Agreement and the provisions of Enbridge Management's limited liability company agreement, the number of outstanding Enbridge Management shares and the number of our i-units will at all times be equal., 193563=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Various states in which we operate have authority to issue additional regulations affecting intrastate or gathering pipeline design, safety and operational requirements.

Business,\u0097Business Strategy,\u0097Liquids,\" Enbridge and the Partnership have proposed a multi-phase expansion project of the Lakehead system to CAPP, to provide additional capacity to the PADD II markets and other new markets. There are currently two other proposed projects that compete with our Lakehead system expansion. During 2004, Koch approached CAPP to indicate their interest in expanding capacity from our Lakehead system's Clearbrook, Minnesota terminal to Flint Hills refinery in Rosemount, Minnesota. Flint Hills owns an interest in the existing pipeline, known as the Minnesota Pipeline, along this corridor. The expansion will be initially designed to transport additional WCSB crude via Clearbrook to fill the 50,000 Bpd announced expansion at the Rosemount facility. Koch also owns an existing pipeline serving the Rosemount refinery from the Wood River area, known as Wood River Pipe Line. As part of their proposal, Koch indicated a willingness to consider a reversal of the Wood River Pipe Line if sufficient demand materializes in the Wood River area and sufficient capacity into Rosemount from Clearbrook is constructed as part of the expansion plans of Koch. Throughput on our Lakehead system to Clearbrook is expected to benefit from the Koch/Flint Hills expansion; however, volumes moving on a reversed Wood River Pipe Line would detract from our Lakehead system throughput downstream of Clearbrook. We are not aware of any recent developments concerning the potential to expand the Minnesota Pipe Line or to reverse the Wood River Pipe Line., 92877=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To meet demand for WCSB crude in PADD IV and the Puget Sound Area of PADD V, several pipeline systems are available. The Trans Mountain pipeline, owned by Terasen\u00a0Inc., transports crude oil from Alberta to British Columbia and Washington State. The Express Pipeline, owned equally by Terasen, Borealis Infrastructure Management\u00a0Inc., and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, transports crude from Alberta to the PADD IV region of the U.S. In addition to the Express system, three smaller pipeline systems transport crude into northern PADD IV. The Bow River pipeline, owned by Inter Pipeline Fund, connects with the Milk River pipeline, owned by Plains Marketing Canada, L.P. to transport WCSB crude into Montana. The Rangeland and Mid Alberta Pipelines, both purchased by Pacific Energy Partners, L.P in 2004, collectively transport crude oil from Alberta to Montana. Lastly, Plains Marketing Canada L.P.'s Wascana system transports crude oil from Saskatchewan to eastern Montana. Of the pipelines transporting western Canadian crude oil out of Canada, the Enbridge system provides approximately 76% of the total pipeline design capacity., 351636=Year ended December\u00a031, 2003 compared with year ended December\u00a031, 2002, 136090=and chemical facilities. In addition, the trucking operations market these products. We provide these services using 105 trucks and trailers and 100 rail cars, product treating and handling equipment and over 9,500 bbls of NGL storage facilities. In addition, our CO2 plant with 250 tons per day of capacity takes excess CO2 from hydrogen producers and we sell it to a variety of customers. At the end of 2004, we took 50% ownership of an underground propane storage facility in Petal, Mississippi, which will augment the services we provide to our customers in the region. The total capacity of this facility is 5.6\u00a0million bbls which increases our storage capabilities., 920316=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective January\u00a01, 2003, the Partnership adopted SFAS No.\u00a0143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (\"SFAS No.\u00a0143\"), which addresses accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived tangible assets. SFAS No.\u00a0143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for the retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the asset, which is subsequently depreciated over its useful life. For offshore pipeline systems, a legal obligation exists for decommissioning requirements. However, the fair value of the asset retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated, as settlement dates and the scope of decommissioning work are indeterminate. For a minority of onshore rights-of-way agreements, a legal obligation may be construed to exist due to the requirement to remove the pipe at final abandonment. However, the fair value of the asset retirement obligation cannot be reasonably estimated, as the settlement dates are indeterminate. In certain rate jurisdictions, the Partnership is permitted to include annual charges for removal costs in its regulated cost of service rates charged to customers. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, the Partnership recorded long-term liabilities of $0.1\u00a0million and $0.8\u00a0million, respectively, with a resulting increase in the related Property, Plant and Equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and a corresponding accretion expense of $0.1\u00a0million and $0.1\u00a0million in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income., 1167063=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table presents certain financial information relating to the Partnership's business segments as of and for the years ended December\u00a031, 2004, 2003 and 2002., 550529=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0R.L.

The System also transported all of the NGL mix produced in western Canada. At the same time, western Canadian refineries processed approximately 25\u00a0percent of WCSB production. The remaining production was transported by systems serving the British Columbia, PADD IV and PADD V markets., 72481=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Supply and Demand.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Lakehead system is well positioned as the primary transporter of western Canadian crude oil and continues to benefit from the growing production of crude oil from the Alberta oil sands. Similar to U.S. domestic conventional crude oil production, western Canada's conventional crude oil production is in decline. More than offsetting this decline is the substantial growth in crude oil production from Canada's prolific oil sands resource. Supply of crude oil from the WCSB has grown consistently since 1999, particularly in the last two years when production from the WCSB has grown by 170,000 Bpd. This growth came at a time when production from western Canada's conventional resources declined by 66,000 Bpd. Production from Canada's oil sands resource has more than replaced the declining conventional production by growing 235,000 Bpd over the last two years. Canada's National Energy Board estimates 2004 production from the WCSB exceeded 2.2\u00a0million Bpd placing it on a comparable level with production from key OPEC members Kuwait and Nigeria., 130736=FERC has approved our negotiated settlement with UTOS shippers, keeping the current rates in effect through 2006., 551983=President, Corporate Development of Enbridge from 2000 to 2003 and Vice President, Corporate Development of Utilicorp United\u00a0Inc. from 1996 to 1999., 380998=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While high natural gas prices positively impacted volumes on our gathering and processing systems, this positive impact was largely offset by poor processing economics in 2003. The majority of our operating income is derived from fee-based contracts, percentage of index or percentage of proceeds contracts. However, a portion of our operating income is derived from keep-whole processing of natural gas. This contract structure requires us to process natural gas at times on limited volumes, when it may not be economical to do so. This can happen when natural gas prices are unusually high or natural gas liquids prices are unusually low., 474399=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results of our natural gas gathering and processing business depend upon the drilling activities of natural gas producers in the areas we serve. During 2004, increased drilling in the areas where our gathering systems are located has generally exceeded the national trend. One of the prominent areas in which this occurred was the Barnett Shale formation in north Texas, where natural gas production increased from 180 MMcf/d in 1999 to 1,021 MMcf/d in late 2004. The Barnett Shale formation is a prominent new natural gas development within the Fort Worth Basin, not previously accessed by our system. To address this opportunity, we acquired the North Texas system in a transaction that closed on December\u00a031, 2003. The acquired facilities provide approximately 220 MMcf/d of processing capacity. The Barnett Shale is being actively developed, and we anticipate that throughput on the North Texas system will increase modestly in each of the next several years., 607931=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For service prior to January\u00a01, 2000, the Plan provides a yearly pension payable after age 60 in the normal form (60\u00a0percent joint and last survivor) equal to: (a)\u00a01.6\u00a0percent of the sum of (i)\u00a0the average of the participant's highest annual salary during three consecutive years out of the last ten years of credited service and (ii)\u00a0the average of the participant's three highest annual performance bonus periods, represented in each period by the greater of 50\u00a0percent of the actual bonus paid or the lesser of the target bonus and actual bonus, in respect of the last five years of credited service, multiplied by (b)\u00a0the number of credited years of service. The pension is offset, after age 65, by 50\u00a0percent of the participant's Social Security benefit, prorated by years in which the participant has both credited service and Social Security coverage. An unreduced pension is payable if retirement is after age 55 with 30 or more years of service, or after age 60. Early retirement reductions apply if a participant retires and does not meet these requirements., 934533=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March\u00a01, 2004, the Partnership purchased natural gas transmission and gathering pipeline assets for $13.1\u00a0million. The assets, referred to as the \"Palo Duro\" system, are located in Texas between the Partnership's existing Anadarko and North Texas systems, and are expected to increase natural gas delivery flexibility to the Partnership's customers. The assets purchased include approximately 400 miles of natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines, together with 5,200 horsepower of compression. The purchase price for this acquisition was applied to property, plant and equipment and no goodwill was recorded. The Palo Duro system's results of operations are included in the Partnership's Natural Gas segment from the date of acquisition., 1014104=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The First Mortgage Notes (\"Notes\") are collateralized by a first mortgage on substantially all of the property, plant and equipment of the Lakehead Partnership and are due and payable in equal annual installments of $31.0\u00a0million until their maturity in 2011. Property, plant and equipment attributable to the Lakehead Partnership is $1,408.9\u00a0million and $1,400.5\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Notes contain various restrictive covenants applicable to the Partnership, and restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, including compliance with certain debt issuance tests. The Partnership believes these restrictions will not negatively impact its ability to finance future expansion projects. Under the Note Agreements, the Partnership cannot make cash distributions more frequently than quarterly in an amount not to exceed Available Cash (see Note\u00a010) for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. If the notes were to be paid prior to their stated maturities, the Note agreements provide for the payment of a redemption premium by the Partnership., 6981=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of February\u00a015, 2005, the Registrant has 46,802,634 Class\u00a0A common units outstanding., 1036986=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In September\u00a02004, the Partnership issued 3.68\u00a0million Class\u00a0A common units at $47.90 per unit, which generated proceeds, net of underwriters' discounts, commissions and issuance expenses, of approximately $168.6\u00a0million. Proceeds from this offering were used to reduce borrowings under the Partnership's Senior Credit Facility by approximately $165.0\u00a0million. In addition, the General Partner contributed $3.6\u00a0million to the Partnership to maintain its 2% general partner interest in the Partnership., 377642=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Volumes on our Anadarko system increased by approximately 32% in 2004, compared with the same period in 2003. The growth is a result of increased drilling activity in the Texas panhandle and western Oklahoma regions. The higher volumes contributed to an increase of $11.0\u00a0million in operating revenue less cost of natural gas., 53824=March\u00a01, 2004, we acquired our Mid-Continent system, which transports crude oil from the Cushing, Oklahoma hub to refineries in the U.S. Mid-continent region and further diversifies our Liquids segment.

Subsequent appeals of this ruling were resolved by settlement and were not adjudicated. In another FERC proceeding involving SFPP, L.P., an unrelated pipeline limited partnership, the FERC held that the limited partnership may not claim an income tax allowance for income attributable to non-corporate partners, both individuals and other entities. SFPP and other parties to the proceeding appealed the FERC's orders to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On July\u00a020, 2004, in a case styled BP West Coast Products LLC v. FERC (No.\u00a099-1020), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision upholding certain aspects of the FERC's orders regarding the SFPP case, but reversing the FERC's ruling regarding the proper tax allowance for SFPP. Based on its earlier Lakehead decisions, the FERC had included a tax allowance in the SFPP cost of service representing the percentage interest in the SFPP limited partnership held by SFPP,\u00a0Inc., a subchapter C corporation. The Court of Appeals rejected the FERC's rationale for its Lakehead policy and instead determined that there should be no tax allowance in the SFPP cost of service because the SFPP limited partnership itself had no tax liability., 934069=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During 2004, the Partnership completed five separate acquisitions of natural gas assets for a total of $10.9\u00a0million.

The decrease is attributable to the early January\u00a02005 fire at the Suncor oil sands plant in Alberta. Suncor estimates a full recovery by third quarter 2005, resulting in a substantial increase in deliveries on our Lakehead system occurring in late 2005., 916482=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Partnership's earnings are also affected by use of the mark-to-market method of accounting required under GAAP for certain basis swap financial instruments. Short-term, highly liquid financial instruments such as basis swaps and other contracts are used to economically hedge market price risks associated with inventories, firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions, primarily within the Marketing segment. As of December\u00a031, 2004, certain basis swap financial instruments, however, did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No.\u00a0133, and thus the changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet and through earnings (i.e., using the \"mark-to-market\" method) rather than being deferred until the firm commitment or anticipated transaction affects earnings. The use of mark-to-market accounting for financial instruments may cause non-cash earnings to fluctuate based upon changes in the underlying indexes, primarily commodity prices. The fair value of these financial instruments is determined using price data from highly liquid markets such as the NYMEX commodity exchange or from OTC market makers., 454757=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In October\u00a02004, Standard and Poors lowered our corporate rating from BBB+ (negative outlook) to BBB (stable outlook) and the corporate credit rating of Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership, our wholly-owned subsidiary, from BBB+ (negative outlook) to BBB (stable outlook).

The North Texas system was purchased on December\u00a031, 2003, and the Mid-Continent system was purchased on March\u00a01, 2004. The primary reason for the overall increase in 2003 performance, compared with 2002, is the full year contribution from the Midcoast assets which were acquired in October\u00a02002., 1245133=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In February\u00a02005, we issued 2,506,500\u00a0million Class\u00a0A common units at $49.875 per unit, which generated proceeds, net of offering expenses, of approximately $124.9\u00a0million. Proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under our Three-year term credit facility. In addition, the General Partner contributed $2.7\u00a0million to the Partnership to maintain its 2% general partner interest in the Partnership., 123197=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The East Texas system is primarily located in the East Texas Basin. While production from most regions within this basin has remained flat for several years, the Bossier trend within the East Texas Basin has experienced substantial growth. The Bossier trend is located on the western side of the East Texas system. Bossier production has grown from under 200 MMcf/d in 1997 to over 800 MMcf/d in 2004. In 2004, we initiated construction of our 107-mile expansion of our East Texas system to provide customers with access to the Carthage Hub, an important outlet to major markets in the Midwest and Northeast U.S. We expect the construction to be completed in mid-2005 at a cost of approximately $150\u00a0million. Once the pipeline is completed we expect to flow approximately 300 MMcf/d from our existing contracts., 1038865=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In January\u00a02004, the Partnership issued an additional 450,000 Class\u00a0A common units pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of the over-allotment option as part of the December\u00a02003 Class\u00a0A common unit issuance, resulting in additional proceeds to the Partnership, net of underwriters' fees and discounts, commissions and issuance expense, of approximately $21.6\u00a0million. The proceeds from the over-allotment were used to reduce the 364-day credit facility. In addition to the proceeds generated from the unit issuance, the General Partner contributed $0.4\u00a0million to the Partnership to maintain its 2% general partner interest in the Partnership., 49993=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At December\u00a031, 2004, our ownership is comprised of a 2% general partner interest and a 98% limited partner interest. The General Partner owns the 2% general partner interest and a 6.5% limited partner interest, in the form of 3,912,750 Class\u00a0B common units in the Partnership. The remaining 91.5% limited partner interest is represented by a 73.4% ownership interest of 44,296,134 publicly traded Class\u00a0A common units and an 18.1% ownership interest of 10,902,409 i-units, which are wholly-owned by Enbridge Management., 452398=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In May\u00a02003, we issued $200.0\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% Senior Notes due 2013 and $200.0\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.95% Senior Notes due 2033 in a private placement. We used the proceeds of approximately $396.3\u00a0million, net of expenses of approximately $3.0\u00a0million, to repay loans from our affiliates and other bank debt. We recorded a discount of $0.7\u00a0million in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes., 657610=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table sets forth information as of February\u00a015, 2005, with respect to each class of our units beneficially owned by the Named Executive Officers, directors and nominees for director of the General Partner and all executive officers, directors and nominees for director of the Partnership as a group:, 1032060=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2004, 2003, and 2002, interest expense is net of amounts capitalized of $2.1\u00a0million, $2.2\u00a0million, and $7.9\u00a0million, respectively. In 2004, 2003, and 2002, total interest paid was $73.9\u00a0million, $69.1\u00a0million, and $58.8\u00a0million, respectively., 548091=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0J.R. Bird served as a director of the General Partner from September\u00a02000 to January\u00a02003 and was reelected as a Director in October\u00a02003. He was elected Vice President, Liquids Transportation of the General Partner in January\u00a02003. He served as President from September\u00a02000 until June\u00a02001. He has also served as Group Vice President, Transportation North of Enbridge since May\u00a02001 and President of Enbridge Pipelines since September\u00a02000. Prior to that time he served as Group Vice President, Transportation from September\u00a02000 through April\u00a02001 and as Senior Vice President, Corporate Planning and Development of Enbridge from August\u00a01997 through August\u00a02000., 472152=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two tangible steps have already been announced under this initiative. First, Enbridge acquired a 90% stake in a pipeline that runs from Cushing, Oklahoma to Chicago and intends to reverse its flow. The pipeline will be renamed the Spearhead Pipeline and will provide capacity to deliver 125,000 Bpd into the major oil hub at Cushing by 2006. This line could subsequently be expanded to accommodate up to 160,000 Bpd. We expect to benefit following the reversal, as western Canadian crude oil will be carried on the Lakehead system as far as Chicago, and then transferred to the Spearhead pipeline. The second step was our proposal to CAPP of a multi-phase expansion of the Lakehead system. The first two phases would expand capacities between Superior, Wisconsin and Chicago, Illinois. In total, these first two phases would provide an additional 215,000 Bpd of capacity at an estimated cost of $400\u00a0million. The last two phases would continue to expand our Lakehead system to Chicago, but would also reach new markets. The third phase would cost about $300\u00a0million and would provide incremental capacity of 130,000 Bpd into the Chicago area. The final phase would then extend this pipeline further south to either Wood River or Patoka, Illinois to provide capacity for further Canadian crude movements to the new markets being served from these hubs., 1243209=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On November\u00a018, 2004, the Partnership entered into a definitive agreement to acquire natural gas gathering and processing assets in north Texas for approximately $165.0\u00a0million in cash, excluding normal closing adjustments. The asset purchase closed with an effective date of January\u00a01, 2005. We funded the acquisition with borrowings under our existing credit facilities., 1100056=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, the Partnership has recorded $3.6\u00a0million and $2.6\u00a0million in current liabilities and $5.3\u00a0million and $7.9\u00a0million, respectively, in long-term liabilities primarily to address remediation of asbestos containing materials, management of hazardous waste material disposal, and outstanding air quality measures for certain of its liquids and natural gas assets., 118371=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Natural gas treating involves the removal of hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, water and other substances from raw natural gas so that it will meet the standards for transportation on transmission pipelines. Natural gas processing involves the separation of raw natural gas into residue gas and NGLs. Residue gas is the processed natural gas that ultimately is consumed by end users. NGLs separated from the raw natural gas are either sold and transported as NGL raw mix or further separated through a process known as fractionation, and sold as their individual components, including ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline. At December\u00a031, 2004, we have over 9,200 miles of gathering and transmission pipelines, 14 treating plants and 22 processing plants. The treating and processing capacities are currently over 800 MMcf/d and 700 MMcf/d respectively., 1040442=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, the Partnership had 3,912,750 Class\u00a0B common units outstanding, which are held entirely by the General Partner. The Class\u00a0B common units have rights similar to the Class\u00a0A common units except that they are not eligible for trading on the NYSE., 374605=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Volumes on our East Texas system increased by 17% in 2004, compared with the same period in 2003, as a result of increased drilling by producers of gas wells in the areas served by the system. These volume increases resulted in higher operating revenue less cost of natural gas of $7.9\u00a0million compared with 2003. Unit margins realized on natural gas volumes vary by location. Natural gas producers have concentrated their development efforts on regions that have a smaller incremental benefit to us than some of the natural gas volumes that the new volumes replace. Lower unit margins are attributable to various factors including the quality of the natural gas being connected to our systems and the presence of competing pipeline systems., 907767=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective January\u00a01, 2002, the Partnership adopted SFAS No.\u00a0142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (\"SFAS No.\u00a0142\"). Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually as of the end of the second quarter, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may not be recovered. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. At the time the Partnership determines that impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the goodwill is written down to its fair value. There have been no impairments recorded in 2004, 2003 or 2002., 209938=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2004, we made capital expenditures of $288.8\u00a0million, of which $257.2\u00a0million was for pipeline system enhancements, and $31.6\u00a0million for core maintenance.

The General Partner will not be required to indemnify the Partnership until the aggregate liabilities, including environmental liabilities, exceed $20.0\u00a0million, and the General Partner's aggregate liability, including environmental liabilities, may not exceed, with certain exceptions, $150.0\u00a0million. The Partnership will be liable for any environmental conditions related to the acquired systems that were not known to the General Partner or were disclosed., 187726=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On July\u00a01, 2004, the FERC approved a Facilities Surcharge, which allows for the recovery of costs for enhancements or modifications to the system at shipper request and approved by CAPP. On an aggregate basis, these enhancements or modifications result in significant incremental costs to the pipeline. The basic concept of the Facilities Surcharge as negotiated by Enbridge and CAPP permits us to recover the costs associated with particular shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge layered on top of the existing base rates and other FERC-approved surcharges already in effect. The Facilities Surcharge is a transparent, cost-of-service-based tariff mechanism that will be trued-up each year for actual costs and throughput and will therefore, not be subject to adjustment either upwards or downwards under indexing. The incremental impact of the Facilities Surcharge is minimal, up to approximately three-tenths of a cent per barrel, depending upon the length of haul and the viscosity of the crude transported. The particular projects to be included in the Facilities Surcharge will be determined as the result of a negotiating process between us and CAPP. Initially four projects have been identified and agreed to with CAPP during 2004 for inclusion in the computation of the Facilities Surcharge that was effective on July\u00a01, 2004., 476122=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acquisitions are expected to play a role in the achievement of our goals in 2005.

Depreciation on the Mid-Continent system accounted for $4.4\u00a0million and the balance relates to new facilities placed into service in the Liquids segment during 2003 and 2004., 126519=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The table below indicates the capacity in million cubic feet per day of the transmission and wholesale customer pipelines with firm transportation contracts as of December\u00a031, 2004 and the amount of capacity that is reserved under those contracts as of that date., 1159093=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Partnership estimates that approximately $36.5\u00a0million of the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, which represents unrecognized net losses on derivative activities at December\u00a031, 2004, will be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months., 458076=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Capital Spending.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At December\u00a031, 2004, we had $49.6\u00a0million in estimated outstanding purchase commitments attributable to capital projects for the construction of assets that will be recorded as property, plant and equipment during 2005., 351763=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Liquids segment accounted for $124.5\u00a0million of operating income, or 64% of consolidated Partnership operating income in 2003. This was an increase of $12.4\u00a0million (11%) over 2002 Liquids operating income. Operating revenue was $9.9\u00a0million higher in 2003 compared with 2002 due to higher deliveries on our Lakehead and North Dakota systems, partially offset by slightly lower tariffs. Overall, production of western Canadian crude oil increased in 2003 over 2002 mainly due to the start up of new oil sands projects in the province of Alberta. The new AOSP project contributed incremental supply beginning in July\u00a02003, which had a positive impact on Lakehead system volumes., 397894=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interest expense was $88.4\u00a0million in 2004 compared with $85.0\u00a0million in 2003 and $59.2\u00a0million in 2002. The $3.4\u00a0million (4%) increase in 2004 compared with 2003 reflects higher average borrowings, partially offset by decreases in our average borrowing rates. The increase of $25.8\u00a0million (44%) in 2003 compared with 2002 reflects higher average borrowings during 2003 due to the full year impact on interest expense of the debt assumed upon the acquisition of the Midcoast system in October\u00a02002. The increase was partially offset by lower average borrowing rates from the end of 2001., 464408=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On January\u00a024, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a distribution payable on February\u00a014, 2005, to our unitholders of record as of February\u00a03, 2005, of our available cash of $61.0\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2004, or $0.925 per common unit. Of this distribution, $50.7\u00a0million was paid in cash, $10.1\u00a0million was distributed in i-units to holders of our i-units and $0.2\u00a0million was retained from the General Partner in respect of this i-unit distribution., 373007=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Natural Gas segment accounted for $98.1\u00a0million of operating income, or 41% of consolidated Partnership operating income in 2004.

During the time that these assets have been owned by the Partnership, since October\u00a02002, Management has completed a review of the affected sites and determined that suspected contamination is less significant than originally estimated. This assessment was based upon information gathered during the ownership period, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediating contaminated sites for similar assets., 1037604=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In December\u00a02003, the Partnership issued 5.0\u00a0million Class\u00a0A common units at $50.30 per unit, which generated proceeds, net of underwriters' discounts, commissions and issuance expenses, of approximately $240.3\u00a0million. Proceeds from this offering were used to reduce borrowings under the Partnership's 364-day credit facility by approximately $105.0\u00a0million, to reduce borrowings under the Three-year term credit facility of approximately $100.0\u00a0million and to pay the December\u00a015, 2003 sinking fund payment of $31.0\u00a0million on the First Mortgage Notes. In addition to the proceeds generated from the unit issuance, the General Partner contributed $5.1\u00a0million to the Partnership to maintain its 2% general partner interest in the Partnership., 75548=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enbridge and the Partnership annually conduct a survey of producers, refiners and government agencies to assess the future supply and demand for WCSB production. The latest survey was conducted at the end of 2004 and reflects both public and confidential information regarding production, refining and pipeline projects. Contrasting with previous surveys, this survey indicates a significantly larger growth in the demand for oil sands production in the traditional PADD II market area, which is the U.S. Government's designation for the area that includes the Great Lakes and Midwest regions of the United States. The recent announcement by Encana Corporation and Premcor\u00a0Inc. to examine the conversion of Premcor's Lima, Ohio refinery to run 200,000 Bpd of blended heavy oil is indicative of the kind of increases in demand in PADD II identified by the survey. Matching the supply and demand responses from the survey indicates that WCSB production could grow from 2.2\u00a0million Bpd in 2004 to between 2.8\u00a0-\u00a03.0\u00a0million Bpd by 2010. This data is part of a preliminary forecast representing forward-looking information prepared by Management and is subject to change., 191493=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On December\u00a017, 2002 the \"Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002\" was enacted reauthorizing and amending the PSA in several important respects. Following requirements of mandates in the PSA, the DOT has issued regulations requiring operators of hazardous liquid and natural gas transmission pipelines subject to the regulations to assess, evaluate, repair and validate, through a comprehensive analysis, the integrity of pipeline segments that, in the event of a leak or failure, could affect a high consequence area. HCA's for liquid pipelines have been defined as: populated areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. For natural gas pipelines, HCA's are defined as segments in proximity to population density or places of public congregation., 171992=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to its jurisdiction over our UTOS system under the NGA and the NGPA, the FERC also has jurisdiction over our UTOS system and our offshore gathering systems under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The OCSLA requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf, referred to as the \"OCS,\" provide open-access, non-discriminatory transportation service on their systems. In 2000, the FERC issued Order Nos. 639 and 639-A, referred to collectively as \"Order No.\u00a0639,\" which required gas service providers operating on the OCS to make public their rates, terms and conditions of service.

Core maintenance activities, such as the replacement of equipment and planned major maintenance activities, are performed to enable our systems to operate at their maximum operating capacity. Enhancements to the systems are expected to extend the life of the systems, reduce costs or enhance revenues, and permit us to respond to developing industry and government standards and the changing service expectations of our customers. Our core maintenance capital expenditures increased to $31.6\u00a0million for 2004 compared with $28.9\u00a0million for 2003, due to the expansion and growth of our existing assets., 81053=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on Enbridge and the Partnership's most recent industry survey, we estimate that deliveries on the Lakehead system will average 1.40\u00a0million Bpd in 2005, a slight decrease of approximately 20,000 Bpd compared with 2004. The decrease is attributable to the early January\u00a02005 fire at the Suncor oil sands plant. Suncor estimates a full recovery by the third quarter of 2005, resulting in a substantial increase in Lakehead deliveries occurring in late 2005. We expect the Lakehead system deliveries to reach 1.55\u00a0million Bpd in 2006, increasing to a range of 1.8 to 1.9\u00a0million Bpd by 2010. These estimated deliveries are part of a preliminary forecast representing forward-looking information and are subject to change., 1121228=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of the First Mortgage Notes approximates $256.8\u00a0million and $303.0\u00a0million and the fair value of the Senior Notes approximates $1,260.7\u00a0million and $739.0\u00a0million, respectively. Due to defined contractual make-whole arrangements, refinancing of the First Mortgage Notes and Senior Notes would not result in a material financial benefit to the Partnership., 354642=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our North Texas system was purchased effective December\u00a031, 2003, and therefore, we did not record any results of operations from this system in 2003.

The Partnership acquired KPC on October\u00a017, 2002. The Remand Order was issued in response to a United States Court of Appeals ruling in August\u00a02003 requiring the FERC to address the issue of appropriate rate refunds, if any, with respect to KPC's initial rates. In the Remand Order, the FERC found that the proper initial rates are lower than the rates previously charged to customers pending resolution of this contested rate case. In accordance with the FERC's findings, any difference between what was collected and these revised initial Section\u00a07 rates for the period of time between December\u00a01997 and November\u00a02002, plus interest compounded quarterly, is subject to refund., 1094783=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, the General Partner also owned 3,912,750 Class\u00a0B common units, representing 6.5% and 7.1% ownership, respectively in the Partnership. The General Partner received cash distributions related to its ownership of Class\u00a0B common units for the years ended December\u00a031, 2004, 2003 and 2002 of $14.4\u00a0million, $14.5\u00a0million and $14.1\u00a0million, respectively., 421639=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At December\u00a031, 2004, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $78.3\u00a0million, an increase of $13.9\u00a0million from December\u00a031, 2003. Of this amount, $61.0\u00a0million was available for cash distributions to our unitholders. Of our cash available for distribution, we retained for use in our business $10.1\u00a0million from i-unit holders and $0.2\u00a0million from the General Partner.

Earnings Per Share (\"EITF\u00a003-06\"), which addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when, and if, it declares dividends on its common stock. The issue also provides further guidance in applying the two-class method of calculating earnings per share, clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two-class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating, including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security. EITF 03-06 was effective for fiscal periods beginning after March\u00a031, 2004. The adoption of EITF\u00a003-06 did not result in a change in the Partnership's calculation of earnings per unit for any of the periods presented because the Partnership had no undistributed net earnings., 529573=information required in our annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management of the Partnership has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December\u00a031, 2004. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to accomplish their purpose. In conducting this assessment, management of the Partnership relied on similar evaluations conducted by employees of Enbridge affiliates who provide certain treasury, accounting and other services on our behalf. No significant changes were made to our internal controls or other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, nor were any corrective actions with respect to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses necessary subsequent to that date., 1093684=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interest expense related to affiliate notes totaled $9.0\u00a0million, $16.1\u00a0million, and $4.6\u00a0million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively., 86251=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The previously announced closure of Petro-Canada's Oakville, Ontario refinery has been delayed into the first quarter of 2005. A portion of the facility was closed in the fall of 2004, resulting in a modest decline in the volume of crude oil delivered by the Lakehead system to the province of Ontario. Future Lakehead system deliveries into Ontario are expected to remain relatively constant at this reduced level., 378060=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similar to our East Texas system, processing results improved on our Anadarko system during 2004 due to a more favorable natural gas and NGL pricing environment. On our Anadarko system, we processed 111,007 MMbtu/d of natural gas in 2004, which was an increase of 35% compared with volumes processed in 2003. Processing activities contributed $7.2\u00a0million of operating income in 2004. This compares with $0.2\u00a0million of operating income for processing activities in 2003. These improvements to operating income were partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses mostly related to variable costs associated with the increased volumes on the system. As a result, operating income on the Anadarko system increased by $16.0\u00a0million (175%) in 2004 compared with 2003., 59133=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enbridge and the Partnership have been working with our customers to develop market solutions that will enable crude oil shippers to have access to new markets in a timely, cost-effective manner. Our transportation development strategy is to provide Canadian producers with continued access to the premier markets we currently serve, and to move crude oil beyond existing delivery points to reach new markets. We have currently proposed a multi-phase expansion project to CAPP. The first two phases would expand our Lakehead system between Superior, Wisconsin and Chicago, Illinois. The first phase would provide an additional 125,000 Bpd of capacity at a cost of $250\u00a0million. We anticipate this additional capacity would be required by 2007. A second phase would provide another 90,000 Bpd at a cost of $150\u00a0million, and would be completed in 2008. The last two phases would continue to expand our Lakehead system to Chicago, but would also reach new markets. The third phase would cost about $300\u00a0million and would provide incremental capacity of 130,000 Bpd into the Chicago area and south of Chicago. The final phase would then extend this pipeline further south to either Wood River, or Patoka, Illinois, to provide capacity for further Canadian crude movements to the new markets being served from these hubs., 922291=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' reported amounts to conform to the classifications used in the 2004 consolidated financial statements.

An impairment loss will be recognized when the sum of estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. If an impairment loss were to be recognized, the amount of the impairment would be calculated as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the assets either through reference to similar asset sales, or by using a discounted cash flow approach. There have been no impairments recorded in 2004, 2003 or 2002., 158490=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October\u00a024, 1992, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act, which deemed petroleum pipeline rates that were in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of enactment and had not been subject to complaint, protest or investigation, to be just and reasonable under the ICA (i.e., \"grandfathered\"). The Energy Policy Act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates. In order to challenge grandfathered rates, a party would have to show, i)\u00a0that it was previously contractually barred from challenging the rates; ii)\u00a0that the economic circumstances, or the nature of service underlying the rate had substantially changed; or iii)\u00a0that the rate was unduly discriminatory or preferential. These grandfathering provisions and the circumstances under which they may be challenged have received only limited attention from the FERC, causing a degree of uncertainty as to their application and scope. The North Dakota and Ozark systems are largely covered by the grandfathering provisions of the Energy Policy Act. The Lakehead system is not covered by the grandfathering provisions of the Energy Policy Act., 484311=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The table below summarizes, as of December\u00a031, 2004, our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps and debt obligations. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest paid rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract., 876245=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Partnership was formed in 1991 by Enbridge Energy Company,\u00a0Inc. (the \"General Partner\"), which is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Enbridge\u00a0Inc. (\"Enbridge\") of Calgary, Canada. The Partnership was formed to acquire, own and operate the crude oil and liquid petroleum transportation assets of Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership (the \"Lakehead Partnership\"). Since 2001, the Partnership has diversified its operations both geographically and by business segments. This has occurred through acquisitions of liquid pipelines and storage assets and natural gas gathering, processing and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast and mid-continent areas of the United States of America. The assets acquired are held in a series of limited liability companies and limited partnerships owned, directly or indirectly, by the Partnership., 1015969=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On January\u00a09, 2004, the Partnership issued $200.0\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.00% Senior Notes due 2009. The Partnership used the proceeds of approximately $198.3\u00a0million, net of expenses of approximately $1.6\u00a0million, to repay a portion of its outstanding debt under bank credit facilities., 926666=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March\u00a01, 2004, the Partnership acquired crude oil pipeline and storage assets, known as the Mid-Continent system, for $117.0\u00a0million, including transaction costs of $2.0\u00a0million. The assets acquired serve refineries in the U.S. Mid-Continent from Cushing, Oklahoma and include:, 130888=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Midla, AlaTenn and Bamagas systems primarily serve industrial corridors and power plants in Louisiana, Alabama and Tennessee. Industries in the area include energy intensive segments of the petrochemical and pulp and paper industries. The Bamagas system in northern Alabama serves two power plants and is contiguous with the AlaTenn system. We market the unused capacity on these systems under both short-term firm and interruptible transportation contracts and long-term firm transportation contracts. These systems are located in areas where opportunities exist to serve new industrial facilities and to make delivery interconnects to alleviate capacity constraints on other third-party pipeline systems. As of December\u00a031, 2004, approximately 74% of the capacity of the Midla system is under contract to affiliated entities., 84840=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During 2004, ExxonMobil Pipeline Company approached CAPP and prospective shippers with a proposal to reverse the direction of flow on their Beaumont, Texas to Corsicana, Texas and their Corsicana, Texas to Patoka pipelines. The combined reversed pipeline will be linked to the Lakehead system at Chicago via the Mustang Pipe Line Partners system to Patoka. Mustang Pipe Line Partners system is 30% owned by an affiliate of Enbridge. Following successful completion of their open season and with financial support from CAPP and Enbridge, the reversed pipeline is expected to transport between 50,000 and 80,000 Bpd of WCSB crude to the refinery market located in Beaumont on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The connection of the Lakehead system with this new market should also support increased throughput on the Lakehead system; however, the reversed system will also be capable of transporting WCSB crude moved via other competing pipelines into Patoka., 78946=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Over the next two years, unblended bitumen production is expected to start or increase from nearly 20 individual SAGD projects. These projects include the expansions at Canadian Natural Resources Limited's Wolf Lake/Primrose area, Encana Corporation's Foster Creek, Suncor's Firebag and Blackrock Ventures' Seal project. Unblended bitumen production is expected to increase by roughly 140,000 Bpd by the end of 2006, more than offsetting the decline in conventional crude production., 124100=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A substantial portion of natural gas on the North Texas system is produced in the Barnett Shale area within the Fort Worth Basin Conglomerate. The Fort Worth Basin Conglomerate is a mature zone that is experiencing slow decline. In contrast, the Barnett Shale area is one of the most active natural gas plays in North America. While abundant natural gas reserves have been known to exist in the Barnett Shale area since the early 1980s, recent technological development in fracturing the shale formation allows commercial production of this gas. Barnett Shale production has risen from 180 MMcf/d to 1,021 MMcf/d since 1999, with the drilling of over 3,000 wells. Growth in this region is expected for at least ten years., 289600=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We record property, plant and equipment at its original cost and depreciate our assets over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the estimated remaining life of crude oil or natural gas production in the basins served by the pipelines. Depreciation is recorded utilizing the group method of depreciation which is commonly used by pipelines, utilities and similar entities. Determining useful life requires various assumptions to be made, including the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served by our assets, normal wear and tear of the facilities, and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs. Changes in any of these assumptions may impact the rate at which depreciation is recognized in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, if we determine that an asset's undepreciated cost may not be recoverable due to economic obsolescence, the business climate, legal and other factors, we evaluate the asset for impairment and record any necessary reduction in its value as a charge against earnings. If there are changes to any of the estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ. For example, if an average remaining service life of 20\u00a0years had been used (compared to the average remaining service life of approximately 27\u00a0years in the 2004 results), depreciation expense would be $158.7\u00a0million or $41.4\u00a0million higher and net income per unit would have been $1.34 or $0.72 lower than 2004 levels. If an average remaining service life of 30\u00a0years had been used, depreciation expense would be $105.8\u00a0million or $11.5\u00a0million lower and net income per unit would have been $2.26 or $0.20 higher than 2004 levels., 676430=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During 2004, incentive distributions paid to the General Partner were approximately $22.9\u00a0million., 363752=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The table below indicates the average daily volumes for each of the major systems in our Natural Gas segment during each of the years ended December\u00a031, 2004, 2003 and 2002, in million British thermal units per day.

Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Partnership maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2004., 446068=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Credit Facilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April\u00a026, 2004, we amended our unsecured multi-year revolving credit facility and terminated our existing 364-day revolving credit facility, each of which was originally entered into in January\u00a02003. The amended facility consists of a $600.0\u00a0million Three-year term credit facility, which matures in 2007. Interest is charged on amounts drawn under this facility at a variable rate equal to the Base Rate or a Eurodollar rate as defined in the facility agreement. In the case of Eurodollar rate loans, an additional margin is charged which varies depending on our credit rating and the amounts drawn under our credit rating. As of December\u00a031, 2004, the facility fee was 0.175%. The Three-year term credit facility contains restrictive covenants that required us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75 times and a maximum leverage ratio of 5.25 times for eighteen months until September\u00a02005, decreasing to 5.00 times thereafter, as described in the Three-year term credit facility. At December\u00a031, 2004, the interest coverage ratio was approximately 4.3 and the leverage ratio was approximately 4.2. The Three-year term credit facility also places limitations on the amount of debt that may be incurred directly by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, it is expected that we will provide debt financing to our subsidiaries as required. As of December\u00a031, 2004, $175.0\u00a0million was drawn on our Three-year term credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 2.05%., 91626=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another proposal that could compete with our planned expansions to PADD II and other markets, was put forward on February\u00a09, 2005, by TransCanada Corporation, in which they proposed a crude oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta to Patoka, called the Keystone project. The Keystone project includes converting one of TransCanada's existing natural gas pipelines located in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as well as new pipeline construction in Alberta and the states of North and South Dakota, Iowa and Missouri. TransCanada Corporation estimates the cost of new pipeline construction at $1.7\u00a0billion. Subject to receiving sufficient producer and refiner support, TransCanada will be seeking regulatory approval for an estimated 400,000 barrel per day system with an estimated in-service date of 2008 or 2009. CAPP is in the process of evaluating the proposed projects by us and our competitors. Enbridge and the Partnership believe a multi-stage expansion of our system for approximately $700\u00a0million, provides a more cost effective solution to future transportation requirements of western Canadian crude oil producers., 457537=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Distributions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the years ended December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, the declared annual distribution rate was $3.70 per unit. We expect that all cash distributions will be paid out of operating cash flows over the long-term; however, from time to time, we may temporarily borrow under our credit facilities for the purpose of paying cash distributions until the full impact of operations is realized., 83854=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On December\u00a010, 2004, Enbridge announced that its Spearhead project had received sufficient commitments to proceed with plans to reverse the direction of flow on the pipeline from a northerly flow to a southerly flow. The Spearhead Pipeline is a 650 mile pipeline currently running from Cushing to Chicago. Enbridge purchased the pipeline from BP Pipelines North America\u00a0Inc. in 2003. The recent open season resulted in 10-year shipping commitments of an initial 60,000 Bpd, increasing to 75,000 Bpd by 2009. Enbridge expects to have the line in service during the first quarter of 2006, with initial capacity of 125,000 Bpd. The line could subsequently be expanded to accommodate up to 160,000 Bpd. The reversed line will originate from the Griffith, Indiana terminal on our Lakehead system and the connection to this new market should support increased throughput on the Lakehead system., 552960=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0B.A. Stevenson was elected Corporate Secretary of the General Partner in July\u00a02004. Between 2000 and 2004 Mr.\u00a0Stevenson held management positions with Reliant Energy,\u00a0Inc. and Arthur Andersen LLP. Prior to that Mr.\u00a0Stevenson was General Counsel\u00a0& Corporate Secretary of Alberta Natural Gas Company\u00a0Ltd, a Canadian gas processing and transmission company, until 1998 as well as an Associate General Counsel of TransCanada Pipelines from 1998 until 2000., 1029559=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April\u00a026, 2004, the Partnership amended its unsecured multi-year revolving credit facility and terminated its existing 364-day revolving credit facility, each of which was originally entered into in January\u00a02003. The amended facility consists of a $600.0\u00a0million Three-year term credit facility, which matures in 2007. Interest is charged on amounts drawn under this facility at a variable rate equal to the Base Rate or a Eurodollar rate as defined in the facility agreement. In the case of Eurodollar rate loans, an additional margin is charged which varies depending on the Partnership's credit rating and the amounts drawn under the facility. A facility fee is payable on the entire amount of the facility whether or not drawn. The facility fee varies depending on the Partnership's credit rating. As of December\u00a031, 2004, the facility fee was 0.175%. The Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants that require the Partnership to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75 times and a maximum leverage ratio of 5.25 times for eighteen months until September\u00a02005, decreasing to 5.00 times thereafter, as described in the Credit Facility. At December\u00a031, 2004, the interest coverage ratio was approximately 4.3 and the leverage ratio was approximately 4.2. The Credit Facility also places limitations on the amount of debt that may be incurred directly by the Partnership's subsidiaries. Accordingly, it is expected that the Partnership will provide debt financing to its subsidiaries as required and as of December\u00a031, 2004 the Partnership's subsidiaries had no amounts outstanding under this facility. As of December\u00a031, 2004, the Partnership has drawn $175.0\u00a0million on the Credit Facility at a weighted average interest rate of 2.1%. Additionally, the Partnership has outstanding letters of credit totaling $39.6\u00a0million that primarily serve to support the Partnership's derivative transactions., 119798=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective January\u00a01, 2005, we acquired natural gas gathering and processing assets in North Texas. Facilities acquired include approximately 2,200 miles of gas gathering pipelines and four processing plants with aggregate processing capacity of 121 MMcf/d of natural gas. This system predominantly gathers gas produced from the Forth Worth Basin Conglomerate formation and is located in an area where future drilling is expected from producers extending the Barnett Shale play's western flank. Most of the gas is purchased at the wellhead and must be processed in order to meet downstream pipeline transportation specifications., 353242=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Power costs increased by $3.4\u00a0million (6%) in 2003 to $56.1\u00a0million from $52.7\u00a0million in 2002 primarily due to the increase in deliveries on the Lakehead system., 1000790=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The aggregate amortization expense for the years ended December\u00a031, 2004, 2003 and 2002, were $3.2\u00a0million, $1.3\u00a0million, and $0.7\u00a0million, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for each year through December\u00a031, 2009 is $3.2\u00a0million., 463364=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We anticipate funding the expenditures temporarily through our bank credit facilities, the commercial paper program we expect to establish during the first quarter of 2005, or with permanent debt and equity funding being provided when appropriate. Core maintenance expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flows., 691203=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this Report has been signed below on February\u00a025, 2005 by the following persons on behalf of the Registrant and in the capacities indicated., 86753=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In anticipation of improving supply and demand fundamentals, a major expansion of the System was commenced in 1999. This expansion, referred to as the Terrace expansion program, was contractually agreed with CAPP and consists of a multi-phase expansion of both the Canadian and U.S. portions of the System. With the completion of the Terrace expansion program, approximately 350,000 Bpd of incremental capacity has been added to the System. In 2004, we completed construction of additional facilities to expand pipeline capacity into the Chicago market., 546364=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M.O.

The asset purchase closed with an effective date of January\u00a01, 2005. We funded the acquisition with borrowings under our existing credit facilities., 350922=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Power costs increased $16.7\u00a0million (30%) in 2004 compared with 2003, mostly due to the growth in volumes on the Lakehead system and higher mill-rates attributable to higher demand and fuel costs. Power costs associated with the Mid-Continent system were $5.2\u00a0million in 2004., 723382=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have completed an integrated audit of Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P.'s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below., 544929=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0P.D. Daniel was elected a director of the General Partner in July\u00a01996 and served as its President from July\u00a01996 through October\u00a01997. Mr.\u00a0Daniel has served as President of Enbridge since September\u00a02000 and as Chief Executive Officer of Enbridge since January\u00a02001. Prior to that time Mr.\u00a0Daniel also served as President\u00a0& Chief Operating Officer\u0097Energy Delivery of Enbridge from June\u00a01998 to December\u00a02000., 629169=Service After December\u00a031, 1999, 278878=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Mid-Continent system was purchased in March\u00a02004. These assets consist of approximately 480 miles of crude oil pipelines and 9.5\u00a0million barrels of storage capacity, which serve refineries in the U.S. Mid-continent region from Cushing, Oklahoma. This system's revenues are primarily toll or fee-based from a combination of regulated assets and contracted unregulated assets., 1097985=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Partnership is subject to federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental risk is inherent to liquid and gas pipeline operations and the Partnership could, at times, be subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions. The Partnership manages this environmental risk through appropriate environmental policies and practices to minimize any impact. To the extent that the Partnership is unable to recover environmental liabilities associated with the Lakehead system assets, to the extent not recovered through insurance, the General Partner has agreed to indemnify the Partnership from and against any costs relating to environmental liabilities associated with the Lakehead system assets prior to the transfer to the Partnership in 1991. This excludes any liabilities resulting from a change in laws after such transfer. The Partnership continues to voluntarily investigate past leak sites on its systems for the purpose of assessing whether any remediation is required in light of current regulations, and to date, no material environmental risks have been identified., 145496=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This agreement also expressly permitted the reversal by Enbridge in 1999 of one of its pipelines that extends from Sarnia, Ontario to Montreal, Quebec. As a result of this reversal, Enbridge competes with us to supply crude oil to the Ontario, Canada market. This competition from Enbridge has reduced our deliveries of crude oil to Ontario., 376664=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On our East Texas system, we processed 191,420 MMbtu/d of natural gas in 2004, which was an increase of 28% compared with volumes processed in 2003. Due to more favorable NGL pricing conditions in 2004, processing activities contributed $10.0\u00a0million of operating income. This compares with $1.7\u00a0million of operating income for processing activities in 2003. The increase in business activity on our East Texas system has resulted in higher operating and administrative expenses of $7.8\u00a0million (17%) in 2004 compared with 2003. These costs are mostly variable in nature and relate to higher workforce related costs associated with an increase in our operations staff, as well as higher overall benefit costs and an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses. As a result, operating income on our East Texas system increased $2.9\u00a0million (10%) in 2004 compared to 2003., 1039627=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In May\u00a02003, the Partnership issued 3.85\u00a0million Class\u00a0A common units at $44.79 per unit, which generated proceeds, net of underwriters' discounts, commissions and issuance expenses, of approximately $165.5\u00a0million. Proceeds from this offering were used to reduce borrowings under the Partnership's 364-day credit facility of approximately $102.4\u00a0million and an affiliate loan from Enbridge (U.S.)\u00a0Inc. by $63.1\u00a0million. In addition to the proceeds generated from the unit issuance, the General Partner contributed $3.5\u00a0million to the Partnership to maintain its 2% general partner interest in the Partnership., 58931=Canadian oil sands, new production is expected to grow steadily during the next 5\u00a0years, with an additional 600,000\u00a0-\u00a0800,000 Bpd available by 2010., 447749=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First Mortgage Notes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The First Mortgage Notes are collateralized by a first mortgage on substantially all of the property, plant and equipment of the Lakehead Partnership and are due and payable in equal annual installments of $31.0\u00a0million until their maturity in 2011. The Notes contain various restrictive covenants applicable to us, and restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, including compliance with certain debt issuance tests. We believe these issuance tests will not negatively impact our ability to finance future expansion projects. Under the First Mortgage Note Agreements, we cannot make cash distributions more frequently than quarterly in an amount not to, 1016386=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On December\u00a03, 2004, the Partnership issued $200.0\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.35% Senior Notes due 2014 and $100.0\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.30% Senior Notes due 2034. The Partnership used the proceeds of approximately $297.1\u00a0million, net of expenses of approximately $2.6\u00a0million, to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under bank credit facilities., 909066=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Partnership evaluates the carrying value of the intangible assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of intangibles, the Partnership compares the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the intangibles are expected to generate. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangibles, the intangibles are written down to their fair value. There have been no impairments recorded in 2004, 2003, or 2002., 654628=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table sets forth information as of February\u00a015, 2005, with respect to persons known to us to be the beneficial owners of more than 5% of either class of the Partnership's Units:, 1091906=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Partnership purchases natural gas from third parties, which subsequently generates operating revenues from sales to Enbridge and its affiliates. These transactions are entered into at the market price on the date of sale. Included in the results for the twelve months ending December\u00a031, 2004, 2003 and 2002, are operating revenues of $23.6\u00a0million, $30.6\u00a0million, and $4.6\u00a0million, respectively, related to these sales., 520974=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some of our natural gas derivative transactions, which mitigate economic exposures arising from underlying natural gas purchases and sales, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No.\u00a0133. As such, the change in fair market value of these derivative instruments is booked to the income statement. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, we recorded losses of $3.5\u00a0million and $0.3\u00a0million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as part of the cost of natural gas expense, to account for changes in the fair value., 450444=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conduct substantially all of our business through our subsidiaries. The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, of our subsidiaries. As of December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, our subsidiaries had approximately $517\u00a0million and $548\u00a0million, respectively, of indebtedness to unaffiliated third parties. The borrowings under these Notes are non-recourse to our General Partner and Enbridge Management. We have guaranteed repayment of amounts due under these notes through an unsecured and unsubordinated guarantee. These notes are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants. These covenants restrict our ability, with certain exceptions, to sell, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to any Person, except in accordance with our agreement. We were in compliance with these covenants at December\u00a031, 2004., 288600=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In general, we recognize revenue when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For our natural gas businesses, we record an estimate each month for our operating revenues and cost of natural gas based on quantities delivered, along with a true-up of the prior month's estimate to equal the prior month's actual data. As a result, there is one month of estimated data recorded in our operating revenues and cost of natural gas for each of the years ended December\u00a031, 2004, 2003 and 2002. These estimates are based on the best available volume and price data. We believe that the assumptions underlying these estimates will not be significantly different from actual amounts due to the routine nature of these estimates and the stability of our processes., 453301=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loans from General Partner and affiliates.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, we had $142.1 and $133.1\u00a0million, respectively, in debt outstanding under a note to an affiliate of the General Partner. This note relates to debt we assumed in connection with the acquisition of the Midcoast system in October\u00a02002. The note matures in 2007 and has cross-default provisions that are triggered by events of default under our First Mortgage Notes or defaults under our Three-year term credit facility. The note is subordinate to our Three-year term credit facility and other senior indebtedness. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, we converted interest payable related to the loans from the General Partner and affiliates in the amount of $9.0\u00a0million and $16.1\u00a0million, respectively, into long-term debt to the General Partner and affiliates., 352551=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On a full year basis, tariffs were lower during 2003 due to negative indexing adjustments calculated under FERC regulations and tariff reductions related to existing agreements with customers. In February\u00a02003, the FERC issued an Order on Remand, which replaced the annual index of PPIFG-1 with an index of Producers Price Index for Finished Goods (\"PPIFG\") without the minus one percent. The FERC allowed the indexed levels to increase for a short period of time in 2003 to reflect the change in the index during 2002. However, effective July\u00a02003, the PPIFG adjustment was negative., 460162=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2005, we anticipate our capital expenditures to approximate:, 393695=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Marketing segment accounted for $3.6\u00a0million of operating income, or 2% of consolidated Partnership operating income in 2004. This was a decrease of $5.8\u00a0million (62%) compared with 2003 Marketing operating income. Operating income in 2004 for our Marketing segment included a loss of $2.1\u00a0million associated with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No.\u00a0133. We enter into financial natural gas basis swap transactions to mitigate the risk on index pricing differentials between our physical gas purchases and corresponding gas sales. When the gas sales pricing index is different from the gas purchase pricing index, we are exposed to relative changes in those two index levels. By entering into a basis swap between those two indices, we can effectively lock in the margin on the combined natural gas purchase and the natural gas sale, removing any market price risk on the physical transactions. Although this is a sound economic hedging strategy, these types of financial transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under the SFAS No.\u00a0133 guidelines. As such, the unqualified hedges are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis, and the periodic change in their market value will impact the income statement. In 2003, the loss associated with unqualified derivatives was $0.3\u00a0million., 214884=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Class\u00a0A common units are listed and traded on the NYSE, the principal market for the Class\u00a0A common units, under the symbol \"EEP.\" The quarterly price ranges per Class\u00a0A common unit and cash distributions paid per unit for 2004 and 2003 are summarized as follows:, 94108=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Terasen\u00a0Inc. has undertaken an expansion of their Express pipeline system, which is expected to add 108,000 Bpd of capacity. The expansion project is expected to be complete at the start of the second quarter of 2005, offering 280,000 Bpd of capacity into PADD IV.

This was an increase of $7.6\u00a0million (422%) over 2002 Marketing operating income. Colder weather during the first four months of 2003 created greater demand for natural gas, increasing the ability to optimize firm transportation contracts in competitive markets. During 2003, the volume of gas marketed by the Marketing segment was 1,068,000 MMBtu/d. Results for the Marketing segment for the year ended December\u00a031, 2003, also include the positive impact of approximately $1.9\u00a0million resulting from the settlement of disputed amounts, which is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income as a reduction of the cost of natural gas., 884336=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective June\u00a030, 2004, as a result of recent acquisitions and changes in management structure, the Partnership changed its reporting segments. The Natural Gas Transportation segment was combined with the Gathering and Processing segment to form one new segment called \"Natural Gas\". The Liquids Transportation segment was renamed \"Liquids\" and there were no changes to the Marketing segment. These changes were a result of stated internal performance measures for the Partnership. The new segments are consistent with how management makes resource allocation decisions, evaluates performance, and furthers the achievement of the Partnership's long-term objectives. Financial information for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect the change in reporting segments., 1094370=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to our partnership agreement, the General Partner owns an effective 2% general partner ownership interest in the Partnership.

Accordingly, this certification was provided as required to the NYSE on December\u00a014, 2004., 195545=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following a leak that occurred on our Lakehead system in July\u00a02002, the federal Office of Pipeline Safety imposed pressure restrictions on the entire line that was affected. We then proposed a return-to-service plan, which included implementing certain internal inspections and other strategies to verify the integrity of the pipeline in the affected area. During 2003, the OPS removed a majority of the restrictions, while directing that a small restriction remain in place in one area of the line in Minnesota. OPS has indicated that this restriction is expected to be removed following another internal inspection and associated pipeline rehabilitation expenditures in 2005, evaluation of the interim performance of the line and assessment of our progress in implementing our risk management plan. Based on our forecast of deliveries for 2005, the remaining ten percent pressure restriction is not expected to negatively impact our earnings., 943544=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective October\u00a017, 2002, the Partnership acquired assets from the General Partner for approximately $875.5\u00a0million, including transaction costs of $4.9\u00a0million and post-closing adjustments of approximately $50.6\u00a0million. In December\u00a02003, the Partnership paid $43.8\u00a0million, which includes $2.0\u00a0million of interest, in full settlement of post-closing adjustments from the acquisition of acquired assets. The purchase price was therefore reduced by $8.8\u00a0million, which is reflected as a decrease to Goodwill in 2003., 429171=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During 2004, we distributed a total of 840,239 i-units through quarterly distributions to Enbridge Management, compared with 833,515 in 2003. We retained $38.3\u00a0million in 2004 related to the i-unit distributions compared with $35.4\u00a0million in 2003., 545478=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0E.C. Hambrook was elected a director of the General Partner in January\u00a01992 and serves on its Audit, Finance\u00a0& Risk Committee. Mr.\u00a0Hambrook serves as Chairman of the board of directors of the General Partner. Mr.\u00a0Hambrook has served as President of Hambrook Resources,\u00a0Inc. since its inception in 1991. Hambrook Resources,\u00a0Inc. is a real estate investment, marketing and sales company., 560277=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The non-management directors of Enbridge Management meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management. J.A. Connelly or E.C. Hambrook serve as the presiding director at those executive sessions. Persons wishing to communicate with the Company's non-management directors may do so by writing in care of Chairman, Board of Directors, Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P., 1100 Louisiana, Suite 3300, Houston, TX 77002., 670934=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At December\u00a031, 2004, the General Partner owned 3,912,750 Class\u00a0B Common Units representing a 6.5% limited partner interest in the Partnership. In addition, the General Partner also owns 1,877,638 Listed shares or 17.2% of Enbridge Management's outstanding Listed shares, constituting an effective 3.1% limited partner interest in the Partnership. Together with the 2% general partner interest, the General Partner effectively owns a total of 11.6% of the Partnership and received $37.3\u00a0million in cash and incentive distributions., 173763=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On November\u00a025, 2003 the FERC issued Order No.\u00a02004 governing the Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers (interstate pipelines). The new standards provide that (1)\u00a0a Transmission Providers' employees engaged in transmission system operations must function independently from the Transmission Providers' sales or marketing employees and from any employees of their Energy Affiliates; and (2)\u00a0a Transmission Provider must treat all transmission customers, affiliated and non-affiliated, on a non-discriminatory basis, and cannot operate its transmission system to benefit preferentially, an Energy Affiliate. The rule defined an \"Energy Affiliate\" as any affiliated company that engages in or is involved in transmission transactions in U.S. energy or transmission markets, or one that manages the capacity of a Transmission Provider, or buys, sales, trades or administers natural gas in U.S. markets, or engages in financial transactions relating to the sale or transmission of natural gas in U.S. markets. Affiliated interstate pipelines are not considered Energy Affiliates. However, gatherers, processors, intrastate and Hinshaw pipelines are considered Energy Affiliates, in addition to marketing affiliates. The new rule will result in additional costs and increased difficulty in our operations, although we do not believe that these regulations will affect it any differently than any other interstate pipelines with which we compete., 549272=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M.A. Maki was elected Vice President, Finance of the General Partner in July\u00a02002. Prior to that time, he served as Controller of the General Partner since June\u00a02001, and prior to that, as Controller of Enbridge Pipelines since September\u00a01999., 381725=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep-whole processing is mostly attributable to the Anadarko and East Texas systems. Our keep-whole processing is a variable element of the Natural Gas segment's operating income. During 2003, operating income associated with keep-whole processing was approximately $1.9\u00a0million. This compares to operating income of $63.6\u00a0million for the Natural Gas segment as a whole. During 2003, high natural gas prices, particularly at the beginning of the year, adversely affected processing results. In the second half of 2003, processing economics improved marginally as a result of lower natural gas prices. As levels of natural gas in storage increased through the year, natural gas prices decreased., 609131=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For service after December\u00a031, 1999, the Plan provides for senior management employees, including the Named Executive Officers, a yearly pension payable after age 60 in the normal form (60\u00a0percent joint and last survivor) equal to: (a)\u00a02\u00a0percent of the sum of (i)\u00a0the average of the participant's highest annual base salary during three consecutive years out of the last ten years of credited service and (ii)\u00a0the average of the participant's three highest annual performance bonus periods, represented in each period by 50\u00a0percent of the actual bonus paid, in respect of the last five years of credited services, multiplied by (b)\u00a0the number of credited years of service. An unreduced pension is payable if retirement is after age 55 with 30 or more years of service, or after age 60. Early, 480324=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In March\u00a02004, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on issue No.\u00a003-06, Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.\u00a0128. Earnings Per Share (\"EITF 03-06\"), which addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when, and if, it declares dividends on its common stock. The issue also provides further guidance in applying the two-class method of calculating earnings per share, clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two-class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating, including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security. EITF 03-06 was effective for fiscal periods beginning after March\u00a031, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03-06 did not result in a change in our calculation of earnings per unit for any of the periods presented because we had no undistributed net earnings., 475454=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are constructing a new 500 MMcf/d intrastate transmission pipeline to carry increased volumes of natural gas to the pipeline hub at Carthage, Texas. Carthage access is important to natural gas shippers because it offers a number of connections to interstate pipelines, which tend to support more favorable margins to producers. We expect to bring the system on line in mid 2005 and are evaluating other projects that further integrate all our major Texas-centered pipeline systems., 159768=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Energy Policy Act required the FERC to issue rules establishing a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for petroleum pipelines, and to streamline procedures in petroleum pipeline proceedings. The FERC responded to this mandate by issuing Order No.\u00a0561, which, among other things, adopted an indexing rate methodology for petroleum pipelines. Under the regulations, which became effective January\u00a01, 1995, petroleum pipelines are able to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index. Rate increases made within the ceiling levels may be protested, but such protests must show that the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline's increase in costs. If the indexing methodology results in a reduced ceiling level that is lower than a pipeline's filed rate, Order No.\u00a0561 requires the pipeline to reduce its rate to comply with the lower ceiling. A pipeline may not be required to reduce its rate below the level grandfathered under the Energy Policy Act. Under Order No.\u00a0561, a pipeline must, as a general rule, utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates. The FERC, however, retained cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement as alternatives to the indexing approach, which may be used in certain specified circumstances., 5251=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indicate by check mark whether the Registrant (1)\u00a0has filed all reports required to be filed by Section\u00a013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12\u00a0months (or for such shorter period that the Registrant was required to file such reports), and (2)\u00a0has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90\u00a0days.\u00a0Yes\u00a0\u00fd\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No\u00a0o, 82767=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We forecast the demand for WCSB production will continue to increase in PADD II. PADD II refinery configurations and crude oil requirements continue to be an attractive market for western Canadian supply. According to the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, demand for crude oil in PADD II increased from approximately 3.2\u00a0million Bpd in 2002 to approximately 3.3\u00a0million Bpd in 2004. At the same time, production of crude oil within PADD II decreased by 15,000 Bpd. This gap is expected to widen, contributing to increased demand for imports of crude oil into PADD II. With the proximity of the WCSB to PADD II, the availability of capacity on the Lakehead system and limited alternative markets for WCSB production, we expect deliveries on the system to increase along with increases in WCSB supply. Based on our industry survey, we expect refineries in the PADD II market to compete aggressively with new markets for access to the growing supply from the WCSB., 723963=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of cash flows and of partners' capital present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. and its subsidiaries (the \"Partnership\") at December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\u00a031, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion., 1104074=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Refunds to our customers were made in January\u00a02005 pursuant to a refund plan agreed upon with customers and approved by the FERC. Our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December\u00a031, 2004, includes a charge of approximately $13.6\u00a0million for the rate refunds and interest. The rate refunds relate almost entirely to a time period prior to the Partnership's ownership of KPC., 183444=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under published tariffs at December\u00a031, 2004 (including the tariff surcharges related to our Lakehead system expansions) for transportation on the Lakehead system, the rates for transportation of light crude oil from Neche, North Dakota, where the System enters the U.S. (unless otherwise stated), to principal delivery points are set forth below., 479770=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Refunds to our customers were made in January\u00a02005 pursuant to a refund plan agreed upon with customers and approved by the FERC.

Furthermore, in our opinion, the Partnership maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u0097Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Partnership's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions., 199958=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An operating permit excursion occurred at our Bryans' Mill Treating Plant in 2003 where a significant amount (approximately 7000 tons) of sulphur-dioxide (SO2) was released above permit limits. We self-reported the incident to the applicable state agency. We found a plant catalyst bed to be deficient and corrected the problem. We have augmented our administrative reporting systems and, 299396=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our earnings are also affected by use of the mark-to-market method of accounting required under GAAP for certain basis swap financial instruments. We use short-term, highly liquid financial instruments such as basis swaps and other contracts to economically hedge market price risks associated with inventories, firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions, primarily within our Marketing segment. As of December\u00a031, 2004, certain basis swap financial instruments, however, did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No.\u00a0133, and thus the changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet and through earnings (i.e., using the \"mark-to-market\" method) rather than being deferred until the firm commitment or anticipated transaction affects earnings. The use of mark-to-market accounting for financial instruments may cause our non-cash earnings to fluctuate based upon changes in the underlying indexes, primarily commodity prices. The fair value of these financial instruments is determined using price data from highly liquid markets such as the NYMEX commodity exchange or from OTC market makers., 112911=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The storage terminals have a nominal storage capacity of 9.5\u00a0million barrels of oil consisting of 91 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 55,000 to 308,000 barrels of nominal storage space. We expect to add four new tanks in 2005 to our existing storage facilities in Cushing which will increase our crude oil storage capacity by 2.3\u00a0million barrels. In addition to being used for operational purposes, we have contracted with various oil market participants for storage capacity within the storage terminals. Contract fees include fixed monthly capacity fees as well as utilization fees, which are charged for injecting crude oil into and withdrawing crude oil from the storage facilities., 1086184=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Partnership incurred the following costs related to these services, which are included in operating and administrative expenses., 57874=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Western Canadian crude oil is an important source of supply serving U.S. requirements. In 2004, Canada supplied approximately 1.6\u00a0million Bpd of crude oil to the U.S., the largest source of U.S. imports. Of the Canadian crude oil moving into the U.S., about 60% was transported on the System, which is the primary pipeline from western Canada to the U.S. We are well positioned to develop additional infrastructure to deliver growing volumes of crude oil that are expected from the western Canadian oil sands. With an estimated $60\u00a0billion of active or planned projects in the western, 1106230=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2004, the future minimum commitments having remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows:, 1104632=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Partnership, as part of its pipeline construction process, must obtain certain right-of-way agreements from landowners whose property the pipeline will cross. Right-of-way agreements that the Partnership buys are capitalized as part of Property, Plant and Equipment. Right-of-way agreements that are leased from a third party are expensed. The Partnership recorded expenses for the leased right-of-way agreements of $1.8\u00a0million, $1.4\u00a0million, and $1.2\u00a0million during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively., 978465=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the years ended December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:, 1015323=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the terms of the First Mortgage Notes, the Partnership is required to establish, at the end of each quarter, a debt service reserve amount. This reserve includes an amount equal to 50% of the prospective First Mortgage Note interest payments for the immediately following quarter and an amount for First Mortgage Note sinking fund repayments. At December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, there was no required debt service reserve, as all required interest and sinking fund payments had been made.}",
