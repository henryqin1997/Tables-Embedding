            "Very safe. They take very good care of us. We have emails from the police, weather company, and anything else that might put us in danger. I got an email one time about a rubbery that happened out side the campus it was like a couple of miles down the road but they wanted us to be aware of it.",
            "If you like walking to class everyday and seeing a new face, this is the place for you.",
            "Well we have this thing at the beginning of the year, every year. Its called Wolfpack Welcome Week. Theres everything, games, prizes, food, free stuff, and tons of booths to get yourself into those clubs I was telling you about. I think its and interesting way to start school, normally you would have to party at the end of the year .",
            "I think I am paying for the education that I would get at a place like Duke but I'm only paying a fraction of the cost.",
            "There are clubs in down town but i know this is for on campus. For that there are so many clubs you wont know what to do with yourself. Then always something happening in your dorm. Lots of programs in Talley Center. Then the movies theatre on campus, yes I said on campus.",
            "Food! Its pretty good. They are building a new area thats going to be full of more food places. But the things that are open now are good. If you mix it up you should be good, lots of variety.",
            "The dorm I live in is kinda small but there are better and bigger rooms because of rebuilding things and such. There are more than even places on campus to live and for the most part they are good. Then there are so many places off campus that you could live for actually less than you would pay to stay in a dorm.",
            "I have a boyfriend who goes to another college and he never has any homework or anything, mean while I am over here working so hard. In high school I had the better SAT and GPA. I have to say its harder but I believe that this is a good thing. They challenge you.",
            "There has only been one problem for me and its the cold. We had snow here today and the school canceled classes after 12 but I had a class at 10:15 all the way across campus that was a very interesting walk.",
            "Its great here. The teachers and staff work as hard as they can to get you to where you have always dreamed and sometime farther. The school makes it easy for you to find help any where: tutor center, tutors for almost every class, SI students to hold extra periods for you to get help, programs the help you find people around you that are in the same classes so you always have someone to ask questions to."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{476881=When I began school in August, I didn't know anyone here. I was an out-of-state student from Virginia. My roomate was from California and I had 2 suitemates. One of them was from NY and the other from Rocky Mount, NC. We have become best friends. I love living in the dorm because you get to meet so many new people. My RA made me feel comfortable and helped me out when I didn't know what to do or where I was supposed to be. The showers are kind of gross, but other than that, it's great., 475399=We have a tradition at North Carolina State called the Krispy Kreme Challenge. I was so psyched when I heard about this because I love donuts....You run from the Belltower 2 miles to the Krispy Kreme downtown store, eat a dozen donuts, and run back. Your goal is to do this in under an hour without throwing up. It happens in January and I think that I might give it a try!, 307242=I stayed in the Sullivan Residence Hall for the 2011 - 2012 school year and I enjoyed the on-campus experience. Although, the morals and values of various students get tested and you may not agree with the things other students do in their spare time, you gain an incredible amount of independence as far as being away from home, deciding (for yourself) when you need to get out of bed, how long it takes for you to get yourself ready in the morning and go to your class. I absolutely LOVED the dorm life. I can't wait to be back. It's almost like living in an apartment with a roommate :-), 442068=Some unusual traditions on NC State is the Target Run which is basically a HUGE group of students get together and go to Target at 2 o'clock in the morning and run to get what they need and out before anyone else does. There is also the doughnut run, where you eat as many Krispy Kreme doughnuts that you possibly can and then run like 5 miles. There is one unusual location on campus and that is the free expression tunnel. It is this tunnel that connects the two parts of northern campus that is split by the rail road. In this tunnel anyone can grab a can of spray paint and paint on the walls. Just nothing with profanity or racist. You have to be nice., 846929=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 653531=The krispy kreme challenge, I never participated but Im told its amazing to watch. 4 miles, 12 dounuts, 2400 calories..... what could go wrong., 189463=After having a tour of the campus and dorms, it looks like there will never be a dull moment. It has one of the best engineering programs and the cost is moderate. I am definitely looking forward to going on another tour this October., 749074=1) Be sure to visit their Open House day in November each year while in high school as each time you learn more and more and will really feel at home as they are sooooo welcoming. 2) Numerous opportunities on campus to work or involvement/participation - something for everyone regardless of financial situation or interests. 3) May not be an ACC giant, but definitely a giant in the engineering and science fields., 110372=Keep at least a 4.0 GPA and a 1800 on the SAT., 275437=Make sure you make the priority deadline! I missed it by two days, and had to wait until the end of March to hear back. By making the priority deadline, you also are applying for all of their university based scholarships. So, APPLY EARLY!, 107137=North Carolina State University is number nine on the Princeton Review Best Overall Public University Value for 2011. That alone proves NCSU is good for your wallet. With NCSU being a top notch public North Carolina Public University, it's economical and a good education., 542144=There has only been one problem for me and its the cold. We had snow here today and the school canceled classes after 12 but I had a class at 10:15 all the way across campus that was a very interesting walk., 833729=My father attended NC State as an engineering student. Growing up, I wanted to follow in his footsteps and always assumed I would go here. After moving to Florida, my plans changed and I never entertained the thought of going back to NC, especially for college. I applied for the heck of it my senior year and was extremely shocked to be deferred to a later decision as a legacy student, top 10 of my class, 5.06 GPA, AA degree upon graduation, and 1800 SAT. Later on, I was accepted. I went back to NC to visit family and thought we could just stop by the campus and see how it has changed. Seeing NC State as a senior in high school was so different from seeing it as a child. After touring the best schools in Florida, I wish I could go to THIS school. I loved the vibe, layout, and tradition on the campus. I felt like I was welcome. I had mostly committed to University of Florida, but after visiting NC State I tried everything in my power to get aid and make the out-of-state tuition affordable. I just didn't happen for me., 754130=There are plenty of things to do throughout the school year for fun. In October, the North Carolina State Fair comes to Raleigh and the state fairgrounds are less than two miles away from campus. Individual housing halls throw parties for various key events during the year. From promoting stress-free exams before midterms and finals, to having competitions between different dorm rooms, there will always be an even around the corner. Parties are optional, however be careful that you don't party too hard. Because Raleigh is the capital of North Carolina, there are tons and tons of historical locations and artifacts located in the city. You can tour the capital and legislature buildings, or tour the museums of Natural Sciences and History., 596804=The state fair comes to Raleigh around October, which is always supposed to be fun. You can also go downtown for First Friday every month, which features free entry to galleries, free food, and giveaways. The museums are all downtown and my favorite, the museum of natural sciences, features a daily cafe on Thursday nights with guest speakers and trivia. Also, Hillsborough street has a lot of small businesses such as the bowling alley, coffee shops, and and other fun places to hang out.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck You definitely get your money's worth when you attend NC State. There are so many activities and sports you can do that are all included in the tuition cost. You can attend the gym, play intramural sports, or even hang out in the library. There is something for everyone. Am enjoying being here I enjoy living in Raleigh. I live 10 minutes off campus, so I have to drive or ride the bus on to campus everyday. However, I enjoy the scenery, the people, the campus, and the learning experiences that have achieved at NC State. There are a lot of clubs, activities, sports, and community service activities to get into as well. Am learning a lot I am pre-vet at NC State. Being involved in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), I tend to take many science and math classes. NC State is a great science and math school and I have learned so much already, even though I have just completed my first year! Login to rate or flag the reviews Riley Carl from Clayton, NC",
