The run-time behaviour when PAM is built in varies with the version of Portable OpenSSH, and on later versions it must also be enabled by setting ./configure --with-pam [options] PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) interface. 3.15 - OpenSSH versions and PAM behaviour. Portable OpenSSH has a configure-time option to enable sshd's use of the If this is not possible for some reason, an alternative is to set StrictModes no in sshd_config, however this is not recommended. $ chmod go-w $HOME $HOME/.ssh $ chmod 600 $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys $ chown `whoami` $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys In this case, it can be solved by executing the following on the server. Typically this is caused by the file permissions on $HOME, $HOME/.ssh or $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys being more permissive than sshd allows by default. 3.14 - I copied my public key to authorized_keys but public-key authentication still doesn't work. Possible symptoms include: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied) X Error of failed request: BadAtom (invalid Atom parameter) Major opcode of",
    "textAfterTable": "[1] Some vendors, notably Redhat/Fedora, have backported the PasswordAuthentication from 3.9p1 to their 3.8x based packages. If you're using a vendor-supplied package then consult their documentation. OpenSSH Portable's PAM interface still has problems with a few modules, however we hope that this number will reduce in the future. As at the 3.9p1 release, the known problems are: Modules relying on module-private data (eg pam_dhkeys, pam_krb5, AFS) may fail to correctly establish credentials (bug #688) when authenticating via ChallengeResponseAuthentication. PasswordAuthentication with 3.9p1 and above should work. You can also check bugzilla for current PAM issues. 3.16 - Why doesn't \"w\" or \"who\" on AIX 5.x show users logged in via ssh? Between AIX 4.3.3 and AIX 5.x, the format of the wtmp struct changed. This means that sshd binaries built on AIX 4.x will not correctly write wtmp entries when run on AIX 5.x. This can be fixed by simply recompiling sshd on an AIX 5.x system and using that.",
