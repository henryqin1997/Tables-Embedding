    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{26738=In particular, the difficulty resided in centering a golf ball core in an amount of polyurethane that was sufficiently cured to keep the core centered while at the same time being insufficiently cured so that the cover material could be molded around the core. Resolution of this problem thus enabled production of the aforesaid Professional polyurethane covered golf ball to commence in 1993., 55353=The polyurethane composition can be formed with a blend or mixture of curing agents. Saturated curatives for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to, hydroxy terminated curing agents, amine-terminated curing agents, and mixtures thereof. If desired, however, the polyurethane composition may be formed with a single curing agent. As discussed, the polyurethanes prepolymers cured with a diol or secondary diamine with 1:1 stoichiometry are thermoplastic in nature. Thermoset polyurethanes, on the other hand, are generally produced from a prepolymer cured with a primary diamine or polyfunctional glycol., 57248=Suitable amine-terminated curing agents include, but are not limited to, ethylene diamine; hexamethylene diamine; 1-methyl-2,6-cyclohexyl diamine; tetrahydroxypropylene ethylene diamine; 2,2,4- and 2,4,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexanediamine; 4,4\u2032-bis-(sec-butylamino)-dicyclohexylmethane; 1,4-bis-(sec-butylamino)-cyclohexane; 1,2-bis-(sec-butylamino)-cyclohexane; derivatives of 4,4\u2032-bis-(sec-butylamino)-dicyclohexylmethane; 4,4\u2032-dicyclohexylmethane diamine; 1,4-cyclohexane-bis-(methylamine); 1,3-cyclohexane-bis-(methylamine); diethylene glycol di-(aminopropyl)ether; 2-methylpentamethylene-diamine; diaminocyclohexane; diethylene triamine; triethylene tetramine; tetraethylene pentamine; propylene diamine; 1,3-diaminopropane; dimethylamino propylamine; diethylamino propylamine; imido-bis-propylamine; monoethanolamine, diethanolamine; triethanolamine; monoisopropanolamine, diisopropanolamine; triisopropanolamine; isophoronediamine; and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the amine-curing agent has molecular weights of about 64 or greater. In another embodiment, the molecular weight of the amine-curing agent is about 2000 or less., 56014=Suitable hydroxy-terminated curing agents include, but are not limited to, ethylene glycol; diethylene glycol; polyethylene glycol; propylene glycol; 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol; 2-methyl-1,4-butanediol; dipropylene glycol; polypropylene glycol; 1,2-butanediol; 1,3-butanediol; 1,4-butanediol; 2,3-butanediol; 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol; trimethylolpropane; cyclohexyldimethylol; triisopropanolamine; tetra-(2-hydroxypropyl)-ethylene diamine; diethylene glycol di-(aminopropyl)ether; 1,5-pentanediol; 1,6-hexanediol; 1,3-bis-(2-hydroxyethoxy)cyclohexane; 1,4-cyclohexyldimethylol; 1,3-bis-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy]cyclohexane; 1,3-bis-{2-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}cyclohexane; trimethylolpropane; polytetramethylene ether glycol having molecular weight ranging from about 250 to about 3900; and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the hydroxy-terminated curing agent has a molecular weight of at least 50. In another embodiment, the molecular weight of the hydroxy-terminated curing agent is about 2000 or less. It should be understood that molecular weight, as used herein, is the absolute weight average molecular weight and would be understood as such by one of ordinary skill in the art., 25639=Since 1960, various companies have investigated the usefulness of polyurethane as a golf ball cover material. U.S. Pat. No. 4,123,061 teaches a golf ball made from a polyurethane prepolymer of polyether and a curing agent, such as a trifunctional polyol, a tetrafunctional polyol, or a diamine. U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,673 discloses the use of two categories of polyurethane available on the market, i.e., thermoset and thermoplastic polyurethanes, for forming golf ball covers and, in particular, thermoset polyurethane covered golf balls made from a composition of polyurethane prepolymer and a slow-reacting amine curing agent, and/or a difunctional glycol., 22521=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/466,434, filed Dec. 17, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,476,176, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein., 25238=Polyurethanes have also been recognized as useful materials for golf ball covers since about 1960. U.S. Pat. No. 3,147,324 is directed to a method of making a golf ball having a polyurethane cover. The curing agents disclosed are diamines, polyols, or air moisture. The resulting golf balls are durable, while at the same time maintaining the \u201cfeel\u201d of a balata ball., 62731=As discussed, polyurethane prepolymers are produced by combining at least one polyol, such as a polyether, polycaprolactone, polycarbonate or a polyester, and at least one isocyanate. Castable thermosetting polyurethanes are obtained by curing at least one polyurethane prepolymer with a curing agent selected from a primary diamine, triol or tetraol. Castable thermoplastic polyurethanes are obtained by curing at least one polyurethane prepolymer with a diol or secondary diamine curing agent at 1:1 stoichiometry., 26329=The first commercially successful polyurethane covered golf ball was the Titleist's Professional golf ball in 1993. The principal reason for the delay in bringing polurethane composition golf ball covers on the market was that it was a daunting engineering task to apply a covering of polyurethane compositon to a golf cire to form a golf ball cover having uniform thickness.}",
