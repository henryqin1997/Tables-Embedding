First that a good guess at the exact formula by continuing the calculating the pattern for a few more terms: F 1 = ? F 1 + F 2 = ? F 1 + F 2 + F 3 = ? ... What is the formula? The sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers is F(n+2) \u2013 1 Now try the same pattern as in the previous question, but using Lucas numbers to sum instead of Fibonaccis. Start from L(0)=2. What is the formula this time? The sum of the first n Lucas numbers L(n+2) \u2013 1 It is perhaps surprising that almost always when when we try to find a formula derived from Fibonacci numbers we find the Lucas numbers are there too!
