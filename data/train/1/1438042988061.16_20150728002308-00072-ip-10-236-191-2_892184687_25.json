            "Many different clubs, sports and fraternities/sororities to keep you busy if you like to be involved in organized activities. Being located in Worcester there are always many things to do and it is an exciting place to live.",
            "Many freshman frequent Morgan Commons for all their meals due to its proximity. They serve many different types of foods and accommodate to any dietary needs. The food is usually pretty decent but some can get bored with it easily so they will go to Goat's Head or Outtakes.",
            "Dorm life at WPI is very nice and has helped me make many friendships. The rooms are decently sized and very clean. Bathrooms are large enough that I rarely have to wait to shower and they are cleaned twice a day.",
            "As a freshman I can say that my classes so far have been manageable. I haven't seen a large difference in the amount of effort I put into my high school work versus college work. As I get further into my field I expect that the classes will get harder but by that time I will have the skills needed to succeed. It is really nice that you only have 3 classes per term because you can really focus on those classes and they are classes that you actually want to take.",
            "The biggest mistake I made was listening to all the stereotypes about this school. People said it was a big nerd school and that I wouldn't be happy if I went there. But they couldn't be more wrong. Yes this is a school where people value academics, but it is filled with many different types of people. Visiting campus is the best thing to do to get a feel for the school. If you do decide to atttend here know that you will find your place on campus in no time.",
            "I am so glad that I choose to go to WPI for my secondary education. I have only attended for 1 semester and I could not be happier. It offers rigorous academics, interesting activities and friendships that I hope last a lifetime."

Although do as many AP courses as you can !, 45577=Personally, I'm in the Pep Band (we march half-time shows as well as play pep music), and it's absolutely wonderful--the entire group is full of energy! I am also a part of Engineers Without Borders, a club that is currently working to bring clean water to a small community in Guatemala., 53477=WPI has the zip cars. You can check them out for the day or for a few hours. Personally I like this because I love the city of Boston and think it would be so fun to drive the 45 to spend a weekend there. Also, even though I visited in February there were still students out on the quad playing frisbee. Seems like a fun community., 13397=I personally hate living in a dorm at WPI. The first one I lived in, Daniels Hall, was extremely noisy past 2:00 AM every night and I barely got any sleep. Studying in my room was also impossible.}",

We are a fast-paced engineering school so you have to want to succeed to do well here, but you will not be on your own if you struggle. Professors and other students want to see everyone succeed so there will be plenty of people to help you along the way. However, the desire to learn and create better products for a better world is a pretty common theme at WPI. Tips for prospective students My only advice is that you master time management skills, which regardless of where you attend, its a good skill to have. As long as you plan out your time well, you should have time to do everything you could possibly want to on campus. Also, take as many math and science classes as you can in high school. Even if you retake the material once you arrive here at WPI, having seen the material",
