On the basis of his school performances he was selected for the Under-19 tour to India in 1997, the Under-19 World Cup in South Africa, and the Sri Lanka A tour to England in 1999. In between, he made his Test debut against New Zealand in 1998-99 but looked all at sea in a disappointing display and did not come into consideration after that. But a match haul of 11 for 126 against England A in March 2005 confirmed his growing confidence and also helped attract the attention of Gloucestershire as they looked for a replacement for Upul Chandana. Bandara, like Chandana, is also a useful lower order batsman. He hasn't been able to nail a permanent place in the one-day set-up but has provided valuable support for Muttiah Muralitharan. It is his all-round versatility which won him a World Cup place for the Caribbean ahead of Chandana. He played just one game and has since struggled to find a place in the line-up. He was, however, named in the probables for the Champions Trophy., 86780=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 90858=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 68818=Mar 28, 2010, 34635=Born December 31, 1979, Nagoda, 83710=The Cricket Monthly: The IPL lasts two months, but through the year talent hunters are scouring India (and the internet) for the next big thing.
