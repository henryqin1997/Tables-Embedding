    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{165273=Dorm life is fine. I live in 1940 our dorm is clean and the other dorms that i've been to are kept very clean as well. The only downside to living in a dorm is abiding by the rules., 679236=Like I said, 1940 is absolutely the best, and I honestly spent most of my time there. As far as unusual, the Jewish center is really cool and has delicious food that you can put on your meal plan! It's a bit off campus, but it is worth it., 962935=Spring Fling every year the week of April 20th, big block party. That's about it., 592251=Depending on the dorm, your experience will obviously vary. Some dorms separate boys and girls by floor, while others have co-ed floors. Some dorms are communal floors, while others are suite-style and have different wings that become a students community. If you prefer more privacy, then the suite style dorms(1940, 1300, The Edge, White Hall) Might be more for you!, 619197=It's okay, KDR, PKT, and Kappa Sig are the party frats. So is AEPi but they are obviously racist/sexist, they do not let guys in rarely and never without a 2:1 girl to guy ratio., 320646=You must have a SAT score above a 1300 in order to get in without the Summer Bridge Program. If you are chosen to participate in the Summer Bridge program do not be discourage. I went through that program and I made it. I passed. The program gives you a head start that the other incoming students won't know anything about., 622275=I couldn't have asked for a better living setting than at 1300, a freshman dorm at Temple U. But its one of the newer higher end dorms, so my experience might have been slightly better than others., 699366=The best dorms on campus are 1940 and 1300. However, other dorms such as Peabody and The Edge fall short went it comes to space and safety. During my orientation the bathrooms on my particular floor were not cleaned and remained uncleaned for the two days we stayed there., 681117=If you live in 1940 you will have an amazing year. I love that residence hall and I highly recommend it to anyone considering Temple., 81498=The academic aspect of Temple was fair-meaning it wasn't extremely strict nor was it easy peasy (Oh Temple help me with the spelling of that word. Is it a word?). The breakdown of large lecture halls into smaller workshops/laboratories helped strengthen students' knowledge and gave them an opportunity to ask questions without feeling self conscious in front of a large audience. Temple also provided various computer labs within the buildings to give students an opportunity to do research and homework. However, the labs were often overcrowded which resulted in wait time. There weren't any time limits on how long a student can use a computer-just time spent waiting for one. Towards the end of 2007 or so, Temple expanded to include a huge computer lab within the Student Center to decrease computer wait time. The printers were laser printers unlike the Paley Library dot matrix printers (which I believe are updated now) and the computers were in superb condition. There were staff members available within the labs to offer assistance at any time. The workload at Temple was somewhat heavy at times (which of course depended upon the number of credits you took). But, the professors were usually very understanding when a deadline could not be met. Office hours were readily available and there were many resources offered within the three floors of the library. No doubt there were nights during midterms where students stayed at the library until midnight during its extended hours for studying. But isn't that the routine no matter where you enroll? However, the professors were very good at preparing and providing students with all of the materials needed for exams. As a number rating, Id rate Temple at 3.75 for academic rigor. I mean I've seen my friend's statistics homework from his University and I could have been fooled into thinking he was going for his doctrine-not a bachelors. That's how difficult it looked. The only thing I could understand on his paper was the numbers used to distinguish the problems. Although Temple is a large University there is always help should you come across such a homework assignment. As a rating of 3.75 the assignments were academically fair and stimulating. For a student looking for a fair challenge, Temple will most certainly fulfill that need without the hidden formulas behind the equations., 489587=There are many options when it comes to food. Along with the Student Center and Dining Hall in Johnson and Hardwick, there are secret places in The Tuttleman Center and one of the dorms, 1300. It all depends what you want to eat, like buffet style (at Johnson and Hardwick). We also have a plethora of food trucks on the street and little booths in a strip by the Tech Center., 352907=The food at Temple University is terrible. Make sure to select a dorm that does not require a meal plan. 1300 and Temple Towers are great for Freshman and Sophomores, and upperclassmen live off campus. Make sure you know safety tips for a large city because you really need to take care of yourself since Temple's Main Campus is in North Philly. Check out Rate my professor to get the best teachers., 482120=Live in the Temple Towers, White Hall, or Johnson & Hardwick. You will make the most friends there. If you need to study, 1300 is best., 638107=Temple University is a great University. I came here in the Fall 2011 as a Transfer Student, and I loved It. The Instructors are great, and the different resources that the University has to help students learn is great also., 754759=Best dorms in the city (1940, Temple Towers, White Hall, Morgan Hall). The Dept of Res. Life is on their game., 1049495=Dorms are great and offer many different room styles. Each Living-Learning Community can live with their own community in one dorm. For example, the Honors LLC all live on the third floor of 1300. Great community., 796220=The dorm life at Temple is where most students will meet their friends. The dorm halls are filled with people so socializing will never be a problem. All buildings are conditioned and generally new. There are suite-styled and luxury dorms available. In fact, there is a sky-scraper, luxury dorm building being built at the moment and will be finished by Fall 2013 for the incoming class of 2017., 888476=Go for 1940. I lived there my freshman year and it was great. It is in the heart of campus on beautiful Liacouras Walk within a short walking distance of food. It is suite-style, which means there are 2 rooms with 2 people each and the 4 of you share a toilet and shower that are in separate rooms. 1300 is also suite-style and just as nice, but it is on the edge of campus. Johnson and Hardwick are your average 2-person dorms with a shared bathroom per hallway. DO NOT get Peabody. It is the oldest dorm option available. If you like the idea of having an apartment-style place with a TV, microwave, oven, and refrigerator, check out The Edge., 824991=The food is really good here. We have two places to eat but there will be a third in 2013. The one is a buffet style, the other one you pay for everything you buy. The Student Center, which is the non buffet style is the better choice, they have anything from sushi to cheesesteaks. They have many many options.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Will enjoy being here Philadelphia is my favorite American city. I know this school has a reputation among parents of being in a dangerous location, but the school has invested lot of time and money into providing activities on campus as well as ensuring the safety of its students (night club, movie theatre, the Temple police force, etc.). Most of the neighborhoods have also come a long way. As if Temple itself weren't already a great place to be for four years, Philadelphia has a lot to offer as well. There's delicious food, great shopping, a lot of culture, and one of the most impressive concert scenes around. Will learn a lot Temple offers a myriad of degree programs. This allows everyone to find the perfect combination of majors and minors. I would like to become a teacher, so I learned a lot about what there was to choose from between browsing their website and taking a tour. They also have a really impressive tech center with a large amount of computers. So you will, literally, learn a lot.
