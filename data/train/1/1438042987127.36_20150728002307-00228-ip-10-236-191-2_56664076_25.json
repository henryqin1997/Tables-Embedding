Felix Jones led the rushing attack with 51 yards on 10 carries, while Marion Barber had 47 yards on the ground on 14 carries., 44538=Arlington, TX (Sports Network) - Philip Rivers improved to a perfect 16-0 in December games with 272 passing yards and a touchdown, and the San Diego Chargers continued Dallas' December woes with a 20-17 win at Cowboys Stadium., 45358=The 16-game December win streak by the Chargers is the longest in league history. Their last December loss came in Drew Brees' final game as the San Diego starter in 2005., 47530=Dallas followed with a meager three-and-out on its next series, and San Diego took over at its own 11 with a little over nine minutes remaining. The Chargers proceeded to drain 7:13 off the clock and add a Kaeding 34-yard field goal on a 15-play series, making it 20-10 with just 1:56 to play., 47201=The Chargers, though, responded by going back in front on the ensuing possession. Facing a 3rd-and-12 from his own 47, Rivers found Jackson down the right sideline for a 39-yard gain and a first down. On the next play, Rivers hit Gates near the left pylon for a 14-yard touchdown and a 17-10 lead with 10:56 to play., 48696=The Chargers responded by doing what Dallas couldn't, driving 84 yards in seven plays for a touchdown. Tomlinson capped the series with a one-yard score, which gives him 136 this decade -- tying him for most ever in a decade with Cowboys great Emmitt Smith, who accomplished the feat from 1990-99.}",
