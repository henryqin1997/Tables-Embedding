            "Mask adhesion unit and deposition apparatus using the same - A mask adhesion unit for a deposition apparatus includes a magnetic assembly, a cap plate spaced apart from the magnetic assembly, and a magnetic control unit between edges of the magnetic assembly, and the cap plate. A deposition apparatus using the same is capable of adhering a substrate and a mask assembly together using the mask adhesion unit to improve deposition precision, while preventing deformation of a slit of the mask assembly.",
            "MASTER GLASS HAVING STRUCTURE CAPABLE OF PREVENTING DAMAGE CAUSED BY STATIC ELECTRICITY - There is provided a master glass having a structure capable of preventing damage caused by static electricity. The master glass is a substrate on which a deposition process is experimentally performed by being experimentally loaded loading the master glass into a deposition apparatus before starting the deposition process of the substrate for electronic devices. In one embodiment, a master glass includes first conductive patterns and a second conductive pattern. The first conductive patterns are formed to correspond to a deposition pattern required in a substrate for electronic devices. The second conductive pattern electrically connects all the first conductive patterns to one another.",
            "ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING DISPLAY PANEL AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME - An organic light emitting display panel includes a first pixel and a second pixel respectively disposed in first and second light emitting areas. A portion of a first hole transport layer and a portion of a first light emitting layer of the first pixel are disposed in the second light emitting area. The portions of the first hole transport layer and the first light emitting layer overlap a second hole transport layer and a second light emitting layer, which are successively stacked. The second hole transport layer and the second light emitting layer block holes and electrons from moving to the portion of the first light emitting layer."
