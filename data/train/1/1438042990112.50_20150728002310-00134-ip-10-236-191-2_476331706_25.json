When a user selects to search using \u201cANY LOCATION\u201d 1804, the search criteria identified at step 2020 includes a further field by which the media browser server may respond with one or more of the following options:}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{360401=These alternatives may be used in the performance of step 2022. Experience has indicated that option (1) does not scale well and results in much unnecessary searching because users typically do not look at the last ranked results when significant numbers of results are returned. Also users are typically overwhelmed by large result lists Option (2) alone has the disadvantage that new sites have trouble becoming known because such would typically be low in the ranking. Option (3) alleviates the problem encountered by option (2) by randomly introducing the lower ranked locations into the top \u201cn\u201d locations to be searched for the user. In this regard, \u201cm\u201d lower ranked locations may be inserted into the search set, with \u201cm\u201d being (usually substantially) less than \u201cn\u201d. A potential problem with Option (3) is that, due the randomness, any particular search is unlikely to be repeated identically without a special option to do so. The frequency at which the random mutations are performed in Option (3) may be determined by an \u201cexplore parameter\u201d that may be tuned or varied by the user. The tuning or variation therefore indicates how much the user wants to explore the less used locations., 327251=The content provider 1212 will only have total usage statistics from their own metadata server 1214. There may be commercial value in obtaining usage information from individual media browser services. This information could be used to influence how the content provider 1212 advertises their metadata server (ie. whether to pay to have their link included in a default TOC of a particular service)., 306634=In the case of unencrypted delivery, an access key 1230 is sent 1222 from the media browser service 1206 to the metadata server 1214 in response to the request 1226. The metadata server 1214 validates the access key 1230 before delivering/streaming 1220 the stored content 1216. The content 1216 is preferably delivered to the media browser service 1206 and from there to the user 1202 in a device sensitive manner 1228, which in this case is not encrypted. The access key 1230 is preferably formed of two parts. The first part comprises a key part 1210 which is stored with the user's metadata 1208 as part of the media browser service 1206 and operates to identify the user and the item of content that the user has a right to access. The key part 1210, which may possibly be a key value entered by the user at the time of purchase of the content 1216, represents an equivalent to a personal identification number enabling access to that content, and may relate to the specific purchase of content and thus incorporates information regarding the user and the content being purchased. Alternatively, the key part 1210 may be automatically generated by the metadata server 1214. Another part 1224 of the access key 1230 may be unique to the media browser service 1206. As a consequence, the access key 1230 is formed by an authenticated two-part key pair arrangement which, upon receipt by the metadata server 1214, provides for the delivery of the content 1216 to the user's device 1202 whereupon it may be reproduced using a player 1204 forming part of the device 1202. It is noted that the composite key 1230 is formed as a result of certain pre-defined processing, not restricted to concatenation, involving the two key parts 1210 and 1224., 158965=This function can be included in a location path and can be used to request that the metadata server 212 pass the unstructured query on to a search engine associated with the database 210. For example, the location path /Lifestyles/images[query(\u201csurfing\u201d)] would therefore be interpreted by a metadata server 212 as finding all those images that are children of the Lifestyles node that satisfy the unstructured query \u201csurfing\u201d. The query function makes imprecise queries possible. Note that the expression unstructuredQuery must be encoded appropriately for inclusion in the URI. Appropriate encoding is specified by the Network Working Group's Request for Comments (RFC) 2396 available from http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html., 312997=The first user 1310 has a table of contents 1360 stored within the repository 1308 and similarly the second user 1312 has a table of contents 1362. The table of contents 1360 of the first user 1310 includes a metadata item 1318. Upon logon to the service 1302 by the first user 1310, the TOC 1360 is reproduced 1314 at the user device and is seen to include an image thumbnail corresponding to the item 1318. The metadata item 1318 provides for content 1330 to be delivered to the first user 1310, with the content 1330 as received being associated with the one year use period as seen at 1320., 346581=The advanced search requires that schema definitions exist for the locations that have been selected for search (such as 1951). If a schema definition does not exist for a location, then no entries will appear in the table 1952., 327704=Although web servers can effectively already provide these statistics for downloads, having this information for streaming content gives more accurate statistics because it measures \u201cuses\u201d rather than downloads. When a user downloads some digital content, no information is obtained about the number of times the content is actually used since the content is stored by the user. With the described arrangements, the content is not stored by the user but streamed or otherwise supplied on each occasion an access is made via the media browser service 1206. Also, obtaining statistics on the usage per device type can assist content providers target their support/research into playing platforms., 297660=In such a situation, the table of contents as supplied to the user at the desktop computer 1112 may appear as the table of contents 1114 which includes metadata relating to video, audio and the image content items. Each of these items are able to be presented in the table of contents 1114 since the desktop computer 1112 has the capacity to reproduce each of those data formats- As a consequence, such may represent the entirety of the user's table of contents as stored within the database 1104 of the media browser server 1102., 332499=Navigation through a user's information landscape, or TOC, can be achieved by the user interacting with a hierarchical \u201cbreadcrumb\u201d, which is formed from locations 1602 and 1606 both located above the viewing window 1604. The term \u201clocation\u201d is used to refer to non-leaf node TOC descriptors. Within each level of the breadcrumb a user can select to pull down a menu of other contained location options at that level of the breadcrumb., 306243=The arrangement 1200 may be operated using either one of the unencrypted or encrypted content being delivered to the user's device 1202. In either case, after purchase, a request 1226 to either view or play the stored content 1216 is issued from the user's device 1212 and received by the media browser service 1206., 330122=A content provider 1212 may wish to be able to identify, possibly all, media browser services (such as 1206) available over the computer network (Internet, Web, etc). Such may be desired so that the content provider may advertise their content to these services. The content provider 1212 may therefore conduct a search of the network to identify servers that offer the particular (media browser) service and to which the advertising material may be distributed., 340069=A shopping trolley icon 1620 at the bottom right of the interface 1600 is just a specialised stack for items for purchase, A \u201cpurchase wizard\u201d may be invoked from this icon to facilitate shopping and payment where required. The wizard preferably is able to purchase the content associated with the metadata in the shopping trolley using the user's account with the media browser. In other words, if the content was owned by different content providers, it would not be necessary for the user to have to visit each vendor to purchase those items provided by that vendor., 300155=Typically, the content requested by the user is stored at the site of the content provider (eg. metadata server 1108). Alternatively, the content may be stored in a secure fashion together with the media browser service 1102. With such a configuration, the media browser server 1102 can customise the streaming of the content to the device, be it the computer 1112 or telephone 1116, depending upon the destination device in use at the time. Such customisation may involve modifications of bandwidth, coding and any forms of encryption., 311315=Secondly, the encrypted content cannot be intercepted between the media browser server 1206 and the user's device 1202 because it will not play for another session or user. Thirdly, the content cannot be stored at the client because the player 1204 conditionally decrypts the content., 300759=Such an arrangement also permits the user to browse content in the form of previews prior to that content being purchased. Once satisfied with a preview, the user may then select to buy a right to access the content. This right may allow the user a single play/view of the digital item, play/view rights for a predetermined period of time, or an unlimited copy of the digital contents (CD or electronic). When purchasing the right to use the content, the user can also specify the quality of the service (QOS) desired for the purchased content (eg. the number of channels, associated movie clips, etc). Once a purchase is made, the QOS will represent the maximum QOS available to the user irrespective of the device being used. This is because if the user logs onto the media browser server 1102 from a device that cannot utilise the purchased QOS, a lower QOS will result. An example of this is where the user purchases the right for reproduction of CD quality audio using the desktop computer 1112. At some later time, whilst in possession of the telephone handset 1116, the user may select reproduction of the previously purchased CD audio which, by virtue of the lower quality output of the telephone handset, may be reproduced at a lower quality of service (eg. telephone quality)., 302459=In each instance of the examples noted above, the TOC provided to the user is one derived from the user's data within the repository 1104, but modified by the media browser server 1102 depending on the particular device being used at the time, With such an arrangement, the media browser server 1102 has the capacity to detect the type of 10 device connected to the server 1102 at any time and ensure delivery of content to that device in an appropriate format without delivery of superfluous information. Such an arrangement is desirable through automatically limiting user selections to content that is able to be reproduced, and also in the reduction of bandwidth being consumed by data transfers across the system 1100., 308642=It is to be noted that this (unencrypted) method described only ensures that the user is a valid receiver of the content purchased. Once the metadata server 1214 delivers the content, the metadata server 1214 has no control over the user storing the content or the content being intercepted by other potential users., 309005=In the case of encrypted content being sent to the user, when the metadata server 1214 receives a valid access key 1230, the metadata server 1214 responds by sending 1220 the content 1216 to the media browser service 1206. Tis delivery need not be encrypted since, in most implementations, the link between the media browser service 1206 and the metadata server 1214 may be a permanent or otherwise trusted connection. Encryption however may be applied for additional protection. The media browser service 1206 then encrypts the streamed content 1220 using key information that identifies the user's current session and sends the encrypted content to the user's device. In this regard, the key information may be made of or generated from an identification (ID) provided by the user's client device during the request 1226., 328511=With the various arrangements described, an allowable rating may be associated with a user account with the media browser service 1206, or a particular device. The former requires that there be a range of media browser accounts. Such may be implemented for example by a parent (controller) and child (controlled) accounts. The ratings control could be used for:, 323452=The car equipment 1412 then operates to renegotiate the session with the media browser service 1402, performing the same step that the telephone 1404 performed to commence the session. This may involve negotiating extra payment, for example where the quality of service able to be reproduced by the equipment 1412 is greater than that of the telephone 1404 and such is desired by the user. A specific handover time is also negotiated, thereby permitting seamless transfer between the players. It will be appreciated in this connection that the car equipment 1412 will include some form of RF transceiver apparatus to permit appropriate communications with the media browser service 1402, via a cellular telephone network for example., 316340=A further implementation may be obtained through wired or wireless communication of metadata to a person who is not a registered user of the media browser service 1302. In such an instance, the metadata may be wrapped in a voucher which contains the URI of the sender's 1310 media browser service 1302, together with an anonymous user login for the service 1302. The recipient of the voucher may then select the voucher (eg. via a mouse click) to access the media browser service 1302 and view the metadata via the anonymous login. The recipient can then play the content, dependent upon the right-to-use information in the metadata being sufficiently permissive., 309938=The player 1204 at the user's device 1202 then conditionally decrypts the content if it has a valid decryption key. This key may be the key information used to encrypt the content. Alternatively it may be a private key of a public/private key encryption pair. The session ID can form part or whole of a decryption key for the content. The requested time of streaming from the server 1206 may additionally or alternatively be used., 321502=In an exemplary operation, the user in possession of the mobile telephone 1404 may request streaming media from a provider accessible via the media browser service 1402. Such may involve payment or may be free of charge. Upon making the request, the telephone 1404 may also transmit to the media browser service 1402 a public key to enable the provider to authenticate the use of the media. The provider can then send to the telephone 1404, via the media browser service 1402 if such are not one and the same, metadata relating to the session. This includes a session identifier and may include a key that is used to unlock the media. The key is encoded with the public key of the telephone 1404 so that only the specific destination telephone 1404 can decode the media using a complementary private key stored within the telephone 1404. The private key is typically secured within memory of the telephone 1404 and is not intended for export from that device, thereby preventing some other device masquerading as the telephone 1404., 302099=Such a change in the QOS can be detected by the media browser server 1102 depending upon the device connected at the time, thereby providing for the media browser server 1102 to extract the appropriate content via the metadata server 1108 at the reproduction QOS applicable to the device in use at the time, 310422=This (encrypted) method of content delivery provides protection at three separate levels. Firstly, at the metadata server 1214, content is only delivered to the media browser server 1206 if a valid access key is received. Preferably, the media browser server 1206 checks whether a request is valid with respect to the set time in the right of use conditions. That is, the media browser server 1206 checks on expiry date before sending the access key 1230 to the metadata server 1214 of the content provider 1212. The media browser service can do this by checking the link to usage information. This requires the usage information to be structured according to a predetermined schema. Alternatively, and preferably, the media browser may just send the request and the metadata server will check the usage rights., 83434=The existence of a link, using XLink, is asserted by an XLink linking element. These elements need to be recognised by applications in order to provide appropriate display or behaviour. XLink uses a namespace to accomplish link recognition. The XLink namespace used by the preferred arrangement has the URI, http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink, and is associated with the xlink prefix. This association is achieved using the xmlns attribute of XML (eg. xmlns:xlink=\u2018http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\u2019). XLink's namespace provides definitions of global attributes that can be used on elements that are in any arbitrary namespace. These global attributes (xlink:type, xlink:href, xlink:role, xlink:title, xlink:show, xlink:actuate, xlink:from and xlink:to) can be used to make elements recognisable as linking elements. For example, if the value of the xlink:type attribute is set to \u201csimple\u201d for a particular element, then that element is treated as a simple linking element and the value of the attribute, xlink:href, contains the target of that link. For the purposes of this description, definitions of the linking attributes using XML schema are included below in Example B., 324267=When the handover time is reached, the media browser service 1402 stops sending session media to the telephone 1404 and commences sending the media to the car equipment 1412. The metadata used by the telephone 1404 is now invalid and no more media can be obtained using that particular metadata. The switchover may involve obtaining estimates of the path delays of the telephone 1404 and the car equipment 1412. Methods of estimating path delay in network connections between two participants are known per se in the networking arts., 338565=A panel 1614 on the bottom left displays a set of commonly used properties (index descriptors) for the currently selected item in the viewing window. The properties viewed in this panel are predetermined. If the selected descriptor does not contain index descriptors with these descriptor names, and these properties can not be identified by examining the available index descriptors (detecting, for example, other index descriptors which might also have a type date or a similar descriptor name), then no values are displayed., 234449=In Example H above, the URI targets of the return links to the metadata server 212 contains the \u2018[\u2019 and \u2018]\u2019 characters. In general, according to RFC 2396, it is unwise to leave these characters unencoded in a URI because they can be excluded by some gateways and transport agents. The characters have been left unencoded in this and the following Examples for ease of reading., 139098=The source description 1580 is an XML document seen in Appendix 1, The media browser 101 does not attempt to transform any relevant schema, if one exists. Consequently, the transformed description does not conform to a schema and therefore the description cannot be annotated. This is emphasised in the transformed description by setting the updateable attribute of the media browser 101 to false in the root element 1532 of the transformed description 1590. The XSLT stylesheet used to achieve the transform 1528 is seen in Appendix 2., 337006=The user can define the number of items to display in the viewing window. Often it is desirable to be able to visually present as many items as possible (eg. search results). However if too many items are displayed the content of the items becomes difficult to understand. If a location contains more items than can be viewed in a single window 1606 then a viewing window control 1610 below this window can be used to page through the content. Paging was selected in preference to scrolling because trial users expressed this preference in early useability studies., 311653=Alternatively, the key information used to encrypt the content may include other information such as the access key and expiry date obtained from the right to use metadata, or by a biometric information that can be checked by the player 1204. For example, the biometric information may include a fingerprint, or a voice key identification, to name but a few., 159741=Both Nmtoken and Digit mentioned above are defined in the XML Version 1.0 Recommendation (see http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210)., 305190=At the time of purchase, a rich link to metadata from the repository 1218 relating to the stored content 1216 is forwarded to the user. This rich link, which can also be described as metadata, includes a link to the content, the metadata also including information regarding the stored content 1216 (eg. the listing of the program material) and is used for searching the content, access and usage information giving the user the right to use the content. The access information is required for the user to enable the digital content to be delivered/streamed to the user as and when required. In this fashion, the user does not store the content but, whenever the content is required to be reproduced, the user merely accesses the content via the media browser service 1206. As with the previous arrangement, the content may alternatively be stored with the media browser service 1206 in which case the service 1206 acts as a trusted service for the content provider 1212., 299160=In this case however, the mobile telephone handset 1116 is provided with capacity to reproduce only text on a display thereof and to reproduce sound by means of the loud speaker integrally contained therein or using headset device known in the art and connectable to the handset 1106. As a consequence, text browsing (using, for example, the textual identifiers rather than the visual identifiers in the metadata) may be performed using the telephone handset to display a table of contents 1120 limited only to audio items that are able to be reproduced using the loud speaker of the handset 1116. For example, where the handset 1116 incorporates an MP3 player module, audio components within the table of contents 1120 that include MP3 compressed data may be reproduced. Further, audio encoded in other formats, such as 8 or 14-bit PCM may be reproduced band limited to the \u201ctelephone\u201d waveband of 300 Hz -3 kHz.}",
