If that's not your cup of tea, Harvard Square is the ideal college town, with lots of quality, affordable food (especially pizza), a movie theater, great places to walk and stuff open until 2:00 a.m. I'm told the party scene isn'\u00c2?t what it is other places, but if you want to dance you can find somewhere to do it. Granted, I'm not the type for partying, but the environment and the people around me were so stimulating that I never found myself with a lack of things to do., 138015=There is a huge gate called Johnston Gate that students supposedly never enter or exit through except for twice their whole lives: once when you first arrive on campus in August, and once after you graduate as a senior.

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I absolutely enjoy being there. Wonderful students, wonderful staff. People actually care about you at Harvard. People always ask me, Do they party at Harvard? Yes! Maybe not as crazy as some schools, but we definitely have some great parties. The Cambridge/Boston location is very exciting. The only con I've noticed is a lack of school spirit sometimes. Am learning a lot YES, YES, YES. You will learn tons and only from the best and the brightest. The professors are amazing and the TFs, likewise. The courses are generally designed to push you towards the limit of learning. IMO, the clubs and the student community alone make Harvard a great place to pickup knowledge, skills, and new friends.
