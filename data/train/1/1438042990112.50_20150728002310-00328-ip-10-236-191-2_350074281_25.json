The HPV PCR tests are research tests. The HPV laboratory followed strict research QC/QA and\u00a0has been \u00a0CLIA certified since August 2008. Detailed quality control and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed QA/QC protocols. The analytical methods are described in the Description of the Laboratory Methodology section., 9761=Reducing the prevalence of HPV infection is a Developmental Healthy People 2010 objective: \u201cReducing the number of new HPV cases can help minimize the overall number of cases of high risk subtypes associated with cervical cancer in females...\u201d Detection and typing of HPV DNA in vaginal swabs (in conjunction with testing of NHANES sera for HPV antibody) will allow evaluation of trends in prevalence of type-specific HPV infection by age, sexual behavior, and race/ethnicity. Two HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix) are licensed and recommended for use in girls and women. One vaccine is licensed and recommended for use in males (Gardasil). In mid 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunizations (ACIP), recommended routine vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years and for those 13-26 years not previously vaccinated. In December, 2011 ACIP recommended routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and for those aged 13 through 21 years not previously vaccinated.}",
