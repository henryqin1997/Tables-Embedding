It is an HBCU founded in 1890 and it is one of the cheapest hbcu's to attend. The campus is nice and transportation is available., 66590=I matriculated to Savannah State University in August 2008. Since being here I feel it has been one of the right decisions I've made in my life. Not only did coming here get me away from home, but it opened my eyes to who I am more, introduced me to brand new possibilities and desires, and helped me to mature properly. There are those moments where I can not stand things that may go on here, but thinking on where I have come from, I realize that the things I consider minor annoyances are pushing me to be a better person. My understanding of the situation enables me to grow. It's the college by the sea. SSU I hold dear to thee., 9322=a lot of new construction is being done. freshman will have ALL new dorms. also, because of the $1.00 transportation fee increase we will have off campus shuttle bus this upcoming fall 2011 semester that will take students with no car to local stores, 110475=Dorm Life here at Savannah State is awesome. We have two new freshmen dorms called Tiger Point and Tiger Place. This past year(fall 2011-Spring 2012) was the first year they was in use. They are very comfortable and spacious. And all the dorms are Co-Ed., 470830=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 193986=Is a one of the nations oldest National Historic College and University. Established in 1890 this university by the sea offers over 40 undergraduate degrees and five graduate degrees. Savannah State University also ranked #1 in the MEAC for boys basketball in 2012., 49138=The student to teacher ration is 25:1 meaning each student is given the indivdual attention they deserve., 8812=even though you only have to have a 2.3 try to aim higher. study for your SAT *1350 and ACT*26 so you can score high enough to be exempt from regents exam. bring a fan for your room ! bring shower shoes bring bug spray, 25702=To me suprisingly Savannah State has good safety. Although there have been shootings about 3 or 4 times in the past year, Savannah State is safe for the most part. If you don't have an SSU ID after 8 o'clock you cannot enter campus. Police stay on patrol. They have Emergency Post located consistently throughout campus. and Campus security is on point. I don't ever feel like I am in danger, even if I'm walking around campus at 3 am., 26312=In 2011 I didn't really hear much about greek life. I wanted to pledge before I got there but when I got there I didn't want to anymore because they seemed lame (not alot of members). But since 2012 SSU has had many probates and greek life has became interesting and life has been added to basically all of them. Greek Life for 2012-2013 should be live and in full throttle for the future. The greek life is also of quality.}",
