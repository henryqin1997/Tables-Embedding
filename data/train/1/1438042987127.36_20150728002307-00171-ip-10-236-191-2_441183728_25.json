Table 5-49 summarizes the recommended values for mi in the 1993 AASHTO Guide as functions of qualitative descriptions of drainage quality and climate conditions., 3482=These empirical properties in the 1993 Guide often mix material property and climate factors.

For flexible pavements, the benefits of drainage are incorporated into the structural number via empirical drainage coefficients:, 4025=The empirical 1993 AASHTO Design Guide and the mechanistic-empirical NCHRP 1-37A design procedure have drastically different input requirements for thermo-hydraulic properties. The thermo-hydraulic design inputs in the 1993 AASHTO Guide are largely empirical coefficients grouped in the following categories:, 2198=The environment-related aspects in the 1993 AASHTO Design Guide are grouped into two general categories: drainage and subgrade swelling/frost heave. As described in Section 3.5.2 in Chapter 3, drainage is incorporated via adjustment to the unbound structural layer coefficients for flexible pavements or via a drainage factor in the design equation for rigid pavements. Swelling and/or frost heave, on the other hand, is incorporated via a partitioning of the total allowable serviceability loss \u0394PSI; part of \u0394PSI is allocated to environment-induced deterioration due to swelling and/or frost heave, and the remainder of \u0394PSI is allocated to traffic-induced deterioration.}",

For testing of fine grained low permeability soils, the use of flexible wall permeameters is recommended, which are essentially very similar to the triaxial test apparatus. When rigid wall units are used, the permeant may find a route at the sample permeameter interface. This will produce erroneous results. It should be emphasized that permeability is sensitive to viscosity. In computing permeability, correction factors for viscosity and temperatures must be applied. The temperature of the permeant and the laboratory should be kept constant during testing., 38110=cf = 0.1772 ln( D60 ) + 0.7734, 4016=The swell rate constant \u03b8 is used to estimate the rate at which swelling will take place. It varies between 0.04 and 0.20, with higher values appropriate for soils exposed to a large moisture supply either due to high rainfall, poor drainage, or some other source. Figure 5-33 provides a nomograph for subjectively estimating the rate of subgrade soil swelling based upon qualitative descriptions of moisture supply and soil fabric.

Thermal Conductivity Thermal conductivity K is defined as the ability of a material to conduct heat. Typical units are BTU/ft-hr-\u00b0F or W/m-\u00b0K. Thermal conductivity is used in the EICM algorithms for the computation of temperature distributions with depth and time in the NCHRP 1-37A analysis methodology. Table 5-58 outlines the NCHRP 1-37A recommended approach for characterizing the dry thermal conductivity K for unbound materials. Note that thermal conductivity is not commonly measured for unbound pavement materials, and consequently the level 3 inputs will be used for nearly all designs. The EICM automatically adjusts the dry thermal conductivity for the influence of moisture during the calculations. Heat Capacity Heat capacity Q is defined as the amount of heat required to raise by one degree the temperature of a unit mass of soil. Typical units are BTU/lb-\u00b0F or J/kg-\u00b0K. Heat capacity is used in the EICM algorithms for the computation of temperature distributions with depth and time in the NCHRP 1-37A analysis methodology.
