            "CABLE EQUALIZATION LOCKING - Provided herein are methods and systems that provide automatic compensation for frequency attenuation of a video signal transmitted over a cable. In accordance with an embodiment, a system includes an equalizer and a compensation controller. The equalizer receives a video signal that was transmitted over a cable, provides compensation for frequency attenuation that occurred during the transmission over the cable, and outputs a compensated video signal. The compensation controller automatically adjusts the compensation provided by the equalizer based on comparisons of one or more portions of the compensated video signal to one or more reference voltage levels. The compensating is selectively locked and reset in response to specific conditions being detected, e.g., a locking condition and a reset condition.",

The serial chain reduces the power needed for the motion detection system, allowing implementation of the motion detection system on a low-power computing device, such as a microcontroller. The serial chain can provide automatic address assignment without dedicated pins. The serial chain can also provide automatic sequencing of access to a shared LED. The serial chain can also provide automatic time correlation of data from multiple sensors in the motion detection system. 07-28-2011 20110182519 GESTURE RECOGNITION WITH PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANAYSIS - A system and method for identifying a position of a moving object, utilizing sensors arranged in any arbitrary configuration, is provided. A pre-processing method is applied to permit implementation on a low power computing device, such as a microcontroller. The preprocessing creates a set of training data corresponding to different gestures, based on different positions of moving objects. Accordingly, utilizing the training data, different types of gestures can be",
