            "STRUCTURE FOR OPENING GRIP COVER OF TOY GUN - A structure for opening a grip cover of a toy gun includes a bottom cover assembly and a rear cover assembly. The bottom cover assembly has a bottom cover covering a bottom surface of the grip and a pivot penetrating the grip and the bottom cover. One end of the bottom cover adjacent to the pivot is formed with a first hook. The rear cover assembly has a rear cover covering a rear surface of the grip. The rear cover has a protrusion connected to the grip. One end of the rear cover away from the protrusion is formed with a second hook to be engaged with the first hook. With this structure, the first hook is separated from the second hook when the bottom cover rotates downwards, thereby driving the rear cover to open rearwards by using the protrusion as a center of rotation. In this way, by only opening the bottom cover, the user can open the rear cover assembly simultaneously, thereby exchanging a pressurized gas cylinder in the grip more rapidly. Further, the problem that members may get lost or suffer damage can be prevented.",
            "MULTI-FUNCTIONAL LAMP - A multi-functional lamp includes a carrier module, a rotating element, a light emitting module, a compressing mechanism and an elastic clamp mechanism. The carrier module includes a base and a curved arm coupled to the base. The base includes a shaft protruded thereon, and the rotating element is pivotally coupled to the shaft, and the light emitting module is coupled to the rotating element, and the compressing mechanism is pivotally coupled to the curved arm and enclosed with the curved arm to form a containing groove, and the elastic clamp mechanism includes an elastic element, such that the lamp can be installed on a bicycle or worn on a user's body to provide active illumination for a dark place with insufficient light and an illumination angle of the lamp can be adjusted to illuminate a target area."

The laser sight is selectively located in a first position or a second position. The laser sight includes a light-emitting element for aiming a beam toward the front of the gun body and an activating element for controlling the ON/OFF state of the light-emitting element. The trigger assembly includes a trigger and a connecting rod driven by the trigger to bias the activating element. When the laser sight is in the first position, the trigger is pressed to drive the connecting rod to move forwards, thereby biasing the activating element to turn on the light-emitting element. When the laser sight is in the second position, the activating element is located farther away from the connecting rod and unable to be biased by the connecting rod, thereby turning off the light-emitting element. 20120085015 10-27-2011 PROJECTILE-LOADING ASSEMBLY FOR AIR-POWERED GUN - A projectile-loading assembly ( 20110259312 Published Description Patent application number Ho-Sheng Wei, Taishan Shiang TW 12-18-2008 Hanger of Overhead Projector - A hanger of an overhead projector as described. The hanger comprises a top pedestal, a suspension shaft disposed between first side plates of the top pedestal, a rotation pedestal connected to a lower end of the suspension shaft, a rotation pillar",

The organic material has a thermosetting plastic and an organic additive. The terminal is formed on at low temperature, so the terminal maintains its ductility and mechanical cushioning property. Furthermore, a cost of the terminal composition, especially the thermosetting plastic is inexpensive, so a cost of the electrical component will be reduced. 09-11-2008 Hsiao-Fen Wei, Banqiao City TW Patent application number Description Published 20100267203 METHOD FOR ISOLATING FLEXIBLE FILM FROM SUPPORT SUBSTRATE - Method for isolating a flexible film from a support substrate and method for fabricating an electronic device are provided. The method for isolating a flexible film from a support substrate includes providing a substrate with a top surface. A surface treatment is subjected to the top surface of the substrate, forming a top surface with detachment characteristics. A flexible film is formed on the top surface with detachment characteristics. The flexible film within the top surface with detachment characteristics is cut and isolated. 10-21-2010 Hsien-Hong Wei, Chupei City TW Patent application number Description Published 20100330937 FM SIGNAL TRANSMITTER AND AUDIO FILTERING METHOD - An FM signal transmitter has a processing module, a connecting",
