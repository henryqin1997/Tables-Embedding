This special model was a Trans Am which featured yellow paint, black wheels, and special graphics. Not really much of a send off for one of only two vehicles that survived from the muscle car days to the modern era without interruption. 2002 Pontiac Firebird 0 7073 0 2596 849 TTop (CC1) 516 3241 141 692 507 3.23 Rear Axle (GU5) 214 3257 57 605 225 Hurst shifter (BBS) TA WS6 Conv TA WS6 Coupe TA Conv TA Coupe Formula OPTION",
