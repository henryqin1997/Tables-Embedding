Other income can be primarily attributed to an unrealized gain of $1,764,345 on reconciling to fair value our 34% equity interest in MesoCoat prior to consolidation., 850365=January 1, 15, and February 1, 2012, 899032=Number Outstanding at February 29,\u00a0 2012, 752324=August 29, 2011, 18390=nine months ended February 29, 2012 and 2011, and cumulative amounts from development stage activities (June 27, 2006 (inception) through February 29, 2012), 1075781=As of February 29, 2012, Abakan had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to stockholders., 786321=Balance at June 1, 2010, 1065150=As of February 29, 2012 Abakan had current liabilities of $1,723,015, consisting of accounts payable of $550,365, accounts payable to related parties of $92,707, capital leases of $13,904, loans payable of $527,088, accrued interest of $214,836, loan payable to related parties of $19,500 accrued interest to a related party of $378 and accrued liabilities of $304,237. Abakan had total liabilities of $5,536,324 consisting of current liabilities, loans payable of $3,765,015 and capital leases of $48,294., 610263=March 21, 2011, initial investment, 1066716=For the period from inception until February 29, 2012, cash flow used in operating activities was $2,294,791. \u00a0Cash flow used in operating activities for the nine month period ended February 29, 2012, was $654,941 compared to cash flow used in operating activities of $730,411 for the nine month period ending February 29, 2011. Cash flow used in operating activities during the current period can be primarily attributed to the unrealized gain on the consolidation with MesoCoat of $1,764,345, equity in investee profit of $69,745 and pre-paid expenses of $114,886 offset by depreciation and amortization of $213,021, the amortization of a discount on debt of $451,003, a stock option expense of $1,142,192, stock issued for services of $119,600, equity in an investee loss of $44,408, accounts receivable of $147,964, accounts payable of $139,318, accrued interest on loans payable of $137,007 and accrued liabilities of $99,003., 837121=For the nine months February 29, 2012, we entered into two uncollateralized demand notes with Prosper Financial, an entity controlled by our Chief Executive Officer\u0092s spouse, bearing 8% interest per annum for an aggregate total of $9,000. We also owed $315 in accrued interest for the above notes as of February 29, 2012., 969885=2012, 959140=2013, 541461=The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Abakan will continue as a going concern.\u00a0 Abakan has net losses for the period of June 27, 2006 (inception) to the period ended February 29, 2012, of $6,458,332, and a working capital deficit of $1,099,433.\u00a0 These conditions raise substantial doubt about Abakan\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern. Abakan\u0092s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to develop additional sources of capital, and/or achieve profitable operations and positive cash flows. Management\u0092s plan is to aggressively pursue its present business plan. Since inception we have funded our operations through the issuance of common stock, debt financing, and related party loans and advances, and we will seek additional debt or equity financing as required. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty., 522206=Certain amounts in the nine months ended February 29, 2011 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current nine months ended February 29, 2012 presentation., 562638=Amortization expense was $182,021 for the nine months ended February 29, 2012. In the nine months ended February 29, 2012, we have capitalized an additional $90,327 on patents and licenses, and have begun amortizing those according to our policy., 1050803=For the period from June 27, 2006 (inception) until February 29, 2012, Abakan incurred net losses of $6,458,332. Net losses for the three month period ending February 29, 2012 were $742,695 compared to a net loss of $1,066,280 for the three month period ending February 28, 2011, a decrease of 30%. Net losses for the nine month period ended February 29, 2012 were $1,255,216 compared to a net loss of $2,701,210 for the nine month period ended February 28, 2011, a decrease of 53%., 769315=On February 20, 2012, we issued 20,000 shares of our common stock for services performed valued at $20,000., 137861=February 29,, 578885=Investment balance, July 12, 2011, 6392=2665 S.

We had no commitments or arrangements for such financing at February 29, 2012 though we are pursuing a number of prospective sources that include shareholder loans, the sale of equity, the procurement of long term debt or the settlement of additional debt for equity. We face certain financial obstacles to attracting new financing due to our historical and current record of net losses and working capital deficits. Therefore, despite our efforts we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing required to meet our stated objectives or even to continue as a going concern., 1094156=Abakan incurred net losses of $6,458,332 for the period from June 27, 2006 (inception) to February 29, 2012. Since we have been without significant revenue since inception and have only recently transitioned to producing limited revenue, as a result of the business combination with MesoCoat, historical losses may continue into the future., 556264=y February 29, 2012, 769900=In connection with the above private placements we valued the common stock warrants granted during the nine months ended February 29, 2012, using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions:\u00a0, 887349=Balance at February 29, 2012, 1064419=As of February 29, 2012 Abakan had a working capital deficit of $1,099,433, current assets of $623,582 consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $464,504, accounts receivable of $23,492, a note receivable from a related party of $4,500, and prepaid expenses of $131,086. Abakan had total assets of $11,496,371 consisting of current assets, property, plant and equipment of $2,596,600, patents and licenses of $1,896,703, an assignment agreement of $250,000, an investment in Powdermet of $1,791,401, goodwill of $4,335,646, and finance fees of $2,439., 1054490=We expect revenue growth over the next twelve months as MesoCoat\u0092s new commercial and government sponsored contracts that commenced in the last part of 2011 are completed and new products under development are brought on line for commercial sales., 512954=On December 10, 2009 Abakan purchased a thirty-four percent (34%) interest in MesoCoat, Inc. (\"MesoCoat\"), and on July 13, 2011 purchased an additional seventeen percent (17%), for an aggregate total of fifty-one percent (51%) of the outstanding stock of MesoCoat., 875160=Exercisable at May 31, 2011, 734939=Capital leases payable to various vendors expiring in various years through September 2016; collateralized by certain equipment with a cost of $109,659., 657341=2011, 791754=Balance at February 29, 2012, 581541=For the period June 1 -, 510501=Abakan Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 27, 2006 as Your Digital Memories, Inc. \u00a0, 971066=2013, 511595=Abakan Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Waste to Energy Group Inc., was incorporated in the state of Nevada on November 6, 2009. Abakan Inc. and Waste to Energy Group Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger on November 6, 2009. The board of directors of Abakan Inc. and Waste to Energy Group Inc. deemed it advisable and in the best interest of their respective companies and shareholders that Abakan Inc. be merged with and into Waste to Energy Group Inc. with Waste to Energy Group Inc. remaining as the surviving corporation under the name \u0093Abakan Inc.\u0094, 514835=Powdermet was formed in 1996 as an Ohio corporation and has since developed a product platform of advanced materials solutions derived from nano-engineered particle agglomerate technology and derived hierarchically structured materials., 767476=On February 20, 2012, we converted several debt obligations for $418,798, or 406,600 units consisting of one share of our restricted common stock and one common stock warrant to purchase shares of our common stock, with a purchase price of $1.25 per share and an expiration date of two years from the closing. In connection with this placement we incurred stock expense on conversion of $12,198., 1131701=On March 20, 2012 Abakan authorized the issuance of 37,500 restricted common shares for services rendered pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective agreements in reliance upon the exemptions from registration provided by Section 4(2), and Regulation D of the Securities Act as follows:, 573552=December 10, 2009, initial investment, 576207=Equity in loss for year ended May 31, 2011, 41022=May 31,, 526217=Accounts receivable are stated at face value, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. Abakan provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management's periodic review of accounts, including the delinquency of account balances. Accounts are considered delinquent when payments have not been received within the agreed upon terms, and are written off when management determines that collection is not probable. As of February 29, 2012 management has determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts is required., 635283=On December 10, 2009, Abakan acquired 34% of the outstanding common shares of Mesocoat. On July 13, 2011, Abakan acquired 17% of the outstanding common shares of Mesocoat for an aggregate total of 51% of the outstanding common shares. The goodwill of $4,335,646 arising from the acquisition of a non-controlling interest consists largely of the excess fair value paid due to the added values associated with progress associated with ongoing research and development completed, values credited to the product and intellectual property portfolio owned by MesoCoat and scientific recognition over and above that recorded in relation to the credibility attached to government and university grants. Abakan believes that the MesoCoat acquisition is in line with its business plan and the amount paid will be supported on completion of independent valuations. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes., 986989=This Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other parts of this quarterly report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Cash flow used in investing activities for the nine month period ending February 29, 2012, was $467,516 compared to $1,761,018 for the nine month period ending February 28, 2011. Cash flow used in investing activities during the current period can be primarily attributed to the purchase of property, plant, and equipment in the amount of $84,839 and the capitalization of patents and licenses in the amount of $90,327 offset by cash assumed on consolidation with MesoCoat in the amount of $307,650., 1070932=For the period from inception until February 29, 2012, cash flow provided by financing activities was $8,640,697. Cash flow provided by financing activities for the nine month period ending February 29, 2012 was $1,586,961 as compared to $2,454,529 for the nine month period ending February 29, 2011. Cash flow provided by financing activities in the current period is attributable to proceeds from the sale of common stock of $545,465, proceeds from loans payable of $1,158,106 and proceeds from a related party loan of $39,626 offset by payments on loans payable of $136,995., 3959=Commission file number: 000-52784, 957424=For years ended May 31,, 836302=On June 1, 2011, we entered into a consulting agreement commencing June 1, 2011, with a related individual to provide business consulting.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of Abakan\u0092s financial position as of February 29, 2012, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended February 29, 2012, have been made.\u00a0 Operating results for the nine months ended February 29, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended May 31, 2012., 521592=These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes for the year ended May 31, 2011, thereto contained in Abakan\u0092s Form 10-K/A., 1069410=Specifically, MesoCoat expects to continue to use cash flow in investing activities in connection with financing the construction of a new 11,000 sq. ft. manufacturing plant in Euclid, Ohio together with the purchase of machinery and equipment that will be needed to put the plant into operation. We estimate that $6.8 million will be required to fund the construction and equipment required of which $2,270,901 had been allocated to construction in progress including $ 80,915 in accruals as of February 29, 2012.\u00a0 MesoCoat will require approximately an additional $4.6 million to complete the project which funding is yet to be committed to the facility. Should MesoCoat be unable to secure sufficient funds to complete the project in Euclid, Ohio on a timely basis, the commercialization timetable for certain of its products and certain contracts that it expects to be fulfilled at the new plant will be delayed until such time as sufficient funds are obtained and the project completed. Smaller contracts and grant work being carried out at MesoCoat\u0092s existing facilities and at third party locations will not be impacted by the delay though its operating results will be negatively affected on a prospective basis by a delay or abandonment of the project., 1113324=Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal controls over financial reporting. Such report must contain, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of the year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal controls over financial reporting are effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting identified by management. Since we are unable to assert that our internal controls are effective, our investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline., 864854=Balance at June 1, 2010, 1024122=Founded in 2006 Powderment is nationally recognized as a nanotechnology and advanced materials R&D organization with a history of successfully funding innovation by winning over 80 governmental and Small Business Innovation\u00a0Research\u00a0Grants. All of the products being produced or developed at Powdermet are based on value-creation gained through nano-scale distribution of metal and/or ceramic phases in a structure. Since 2009 Powdermet has deemphasized exploratory research and development placing more emphasis on engineered solutions and product commercialization., 960004=2014, 763478=On June 10, 2011, we closed a private placement for $30,000, or 30,000 units consisting of one share of our restricted common stock and one-half share common stock warrant to purchase shares of our common stock, with a purchase price of $1.50 per share and an expiration date of two years from the closing. In connection with this placement we had no offering costs for a net of $30,000., 519836=The accompanying February 29, 2012 financial statements include Abakan\u0092s accounts and the accounts of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation., 525570=At February 29, 2012, Abakan\u0092s business operations had not fully developed and Abakan is highly dependent upon funding and therefore is considered a development stage enterprise., 837635=On February 2, 2012, we entered into an uncollateralized demand note to a related individual, bearing 8% interest per annum for an aggregate total of $10,500. We also owed $63 in accrued interest for the above note as of February 29, 2012., 1110049=We incur significant expenses as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which expenses may continue to negatively impact our financial performance., 764085=On July 6, 2011, we closed a private placement for $30,000, or 30,000 units consisting of one share of our restricted common stock and one-half share common stock warrant to purchase shares of our common stock, with a purchase price of $1.50 per share and an expiration date of two years from the closing. In connection with this placement we had no offering costs for a net of $30,000., 850784=February 15, 2012, 582281=For the nine months ended February 28, 2011, 1016372=Each of the four CermaClad\u0099 product lines targets different industry segments. Abakan has targeted the oil and gas (CermaClad\u0099-CRA) and oil sands (CermaClad\u0099-WR) industry sectors as two primary sectors on which to focus our sales efforts. MesoCoat signed a $1.7M phased collaborative agreement with Petrobras\u00a0on January 7, 2011\u00a0to develop new process specifications for cladding the interior diameter of seamless pipe with corrosion resistant alloys. In July, MesoCoat successfully passed Phase 1 qualification for Petrobras and is now awaiting notification to start Phase 2. Given the success of this first joint development agreement (JDA), MesoCoat is currently engaged in discussions with several offshore parties that have expressed interest in signing JDA\u0092s for two of the other three CermaClad\u0099 product lines. Although the CermaClad\u0099 process is still considered late-stage R&D, an estimated six months away from market, business development efforts have focused on relationship building with other leading OEM\u0092s, including Exxon-Mobil Corporation, Chevron, Shell, Saudi Aramco and others, to understand both their buying process and the extensive network of EPIC firms they use to install pipeline for conventional oil & gas exploration and production. The oil sands industry, a part of the unconventional oil & gas exploration and production business, presents another great opportunity as pipes are replaced every six months due to extreme wear. Maintenance of existing pipelines is another huge market that might benefit from MesoCoat\u0092s products., 771217=June 6, 2011, 616759=May 31, 2011, 841180=Our board of directors adopted and approved our 2009 Stock option Plan (\u0093Plan\u0094) on December 14, 2009, which provides for the granting and issuance of up to 10 million shares of our common stock. On August 15, 2011, we granted 25,000 stock options to a consultant at an exercise price of $1.25 per share, and these options will expire ten years from the grant date, and will vest in equal one third parts on the anniversary of the option grant date. On October 24, 2011, we granted 100,000 stock options to our former Chief Financial Officer in connection with his Separation Agreement at an exercise price of $1.20 per share, and these options will expire five years from the grant date, and will vest immediately. On January 2, 2012, we granted 100,000 stock options to a consultant at an exercise price of $1.00 per share, and these options will expire ten years from the grant date, and will vest in equal one third parts on the anniversary of the option grant date.

Total research and development costs were $521,740 and none for the nine months ended February 29, 2012 and 2011, respectively., 2896=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transition report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the transition period from \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0., 762402=For the nine months ended February 29, 2012, we issued the following shares:, 965595=MesoCoat subleases its research and development and laboratory space, in Ohio, from Powdermet, a related party. The cost of the sub-lease to MesoCoat is $6,700 per month that expires on May 31, 2020., 972269=2014, 565787=2014, 990455=MesoCoat, founded in 2007 as a spin out of Powdermet, has positioned itself to become a world leader in metal protection and repair through its high speed metallurgical cladding technologies and long-life cermets intended to address specific industry needs related to conventional oil and gas, oil sands, mining, aerospace, defense, infrastructure, and shipbuilding.
