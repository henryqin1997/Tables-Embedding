Bard, Inc. on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2004, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the \"Report\"), I, Todd C. Schermerhorn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of C. R. Bard, Inc., certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:, 431109=EXHIBIT 32.2 SECTION 1350 CERTIFICATIONS, 411269=This Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be effective on the 28th day of May, 2004., 7412=Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income For The Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, 85887=2003, 162840=Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost components include material, labor and manufacturing overhead. For most domestic divisions, cost is determined using the last-in-first-out (\"LIFO\") method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first-in-first-out (\"FIFO\") method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. The following is a summary of inventories at June 30, 2004 and December, 31, 2003:, 315891=Other (income) expense, net - The table below presents the components of other (income) expense, net for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2004 and 2003., 306396=2004, 104261=For the six months ended June 30,, 130364=June 30, 2004, 8142=Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For The Six Months Ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, 65565=Balance at June 30, 2004, 357009=Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe\" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions and contracts that are more complex and have longer terms; competitive factors, including competitors' attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs, the development of new products or technologies by competitors and technological obsolescence; reduction in medical procedures performed in a cost-conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements for procedures using the company's medical devices; delays or denials of, or grants of low levels of reimbursement for procedures using, newly developed devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including but not limited to environmental litigation, litigation regarding product liability such as claims of alleged personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex gloves distributed by the company as well as other product liability matters, and intellectual property matters and disputes on agreements which arise in the ordinary course of business; government actions or investigations affecting the industry in general or the company in particular; future difficulties obtaining product liability insurance on reasonable terms; efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product recalls, withdrawals, litigation or declining sales including reported incidents of migration of the company's vena cava filters; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; future difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the company's products and/or price increases from the company's suppliers of critical components; economic factors over which the company has no control, including changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; other factors over which the company has no control, including catastrophes, both natural and man made, fires or explosions; risks associated with maintaining and expanding international operations; the risk that the company may not successfully implement its new ERP information system; and the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the company's restructuring, the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements as circumstances change. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports., 272796=The growth in consolidated net sales in the second quarter of 2004 was partially offset by price reductions resulting in a 0.6% decrease in net sales as compared to the same period in the prior year. The growth in consolidated net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 were partially offset by price reductions resulting in a 0.6% decrease in net sales as compared to the same period in the prior year. Consolidated net sales were also affected by the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing consolidated net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 by 2.5% as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2003. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing consolidated net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 by 3.2% as compared to first six months of 2003. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the United States dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the company's hedging activities., 299371=Oncology Products - The company's oncology products include specialty access products and gastrointestinal products. Consolidated net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of oncology products grew 25% on a reported basis (23% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's second quarter. United States net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of oncology products grew 23% compared to the prior year's second quarter. International net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of oncology products grew 34% on a reported basis (23% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's second quarter. Consolidated net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 of oncology products grew 23% on a reported basis (20% on a constant currency basis) compared to prior year's first six months. United States net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 of oncology products grew 20% compared to the prior year's first six months. International net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 of oncology products grew 34% on a reported basis (22% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's first six months., 174306=Onux, Inc. - On June 30, 2004, the company acquired substantially all of the assets from Onux, Inc., a manufacturer of a hernia repair fixation system. The company recorded approximately $47.1 million in patents which will be amortized over their useful lives, approximately 15 years. In addition, the company recorded approximately $2.7 million in tax deductible goodwill and approximately $6.0 million in in-process research and development. The company has not finalized the purchase price allocation for the Onux acquisition; however, the company does not expect any change in the Onux purchase price allocation to have a material impact on its financial statements., 429983=CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. SECTION 1350, AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 906 OF THE, 83418=Balance at June 30, 2003, 323178=Investment gain - On April 23, 2004, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (\"Zimmer\") announced that it had completed its acquisition of privately-held Implex Corp. (\"Implex\") for $98.6 million in cash. Bard held Implex shares at a zero basis and accordingly recorded a $6.2 million pretax gain arising from the company's cash proceeds associated with this transaction during the second quarter of 2004., 107803=Nature of Operations - C. R. Bard, Inc. (the \"company\" or \"Bard\") is engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sales of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company markets its products worldwide to hospitals, individual health care professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities. Bard holds strong market positions in vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements as filed by the company in its 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K., 220487=A roll forward of the company's derivative financial instruments for the first six months ended June 30, 2004 is as follows:, 221403=December 31, 2003 notional amount, 430186=In connection with the quarterly report of C. R. Bard, Inc. on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2004, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the \"Report\"), I, Timothy M. Ring, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of C. R. Bard, Inc., certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:, 204759=On April 14, 2004, the company announced that in connection with its brachytherapy business and the commercial litigation entitled Nelson N. Stone, M.D., et al. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et ano., filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, it had agreed with the plaintiffs to settle the litigation for $23.0 million. Under the terms of this agreement, the company also paid $19.0 million to terminate its ongoing commercial arrangements under an asset purchase agreement with the plaintiffs that otherwise would have expired in 2008. In connection with the settlement, in the first quarter of 2004 the company reversed $16.0 million of the $58.0 million charge previously recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 in connection with the litigation., 11921=June 30, 2004, 198499=2007, 236775=Quarter Ended June 30,, 197716=Annual estimated amortization expense for the years 2004 through 2009 is as follows:, 214782=Derivative Instruments - Bard's objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities and anticipated commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The company does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculation purposes. No derivative instruments extend beyond December 2005. The company has formally documented the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives. All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair market value. Hedge accounting is followed for derivatives that have been designated and qualify as fair market value and cash flow hedges. For derivatives that have been designated and qualify as fair market value hedges, the changes in the fair market value of highly effective derivatives, along with changes in the fair market value of the hedged assets that are attributable to the hedged risks, are recorded in current period earnings. For derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair market value of the effective portion of the derivatives' gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income. The company believes that all derivative instruments utilized are highly effective hedging instruments because they are denominated in the same currency as the hedged item and because the maturities of the derivative instruments match the timing of the hedged items. It is the company's policy that when a derivative instrument settles, the associated amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reversed to cost of goods sold or other (income) expense, net as appropriate. It is the company's policy that in the event that (1) an anticipated hedged transaction is determined to be not likely to occur or (2) it is determined that a derivative instrument is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the hedged item, the company would reverse the associated amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net., 374637=April 1 - April 30, 2004, 793=For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, 380697=Date: July 30, 2004, 167908=Software Capitalization - Internally used software, whether purchased or developed, is capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five to seven years. Capitalized software costs are included in machinery and equipment. In accordance with Statement of Position\u00a098-1, \"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,\" the company capitalizes certain costs associated with internal-use software such as the payroll costs of employees devoting time to the projects and external direct costs for materials and services. Costs associated with internal-use software are expensed until the point at which the project has reached the development stage. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The capitalization of software requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the development stage and the period over which the company expects to benefit from the use of that software. The company capitalized $17.6 million and $9.5\u00a0million of internal-use software for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively., 223581=The fair market value of financial instruments was estimated by discounting expected cash flows using quoted foreign exchange rates as of June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Judgment was employed in developing estimates of fair market value; accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies could have an effect on the estimated fair market value amounts. At June 30, 2004, the net fair market value of option-based contracts and the incremental market-to-market value of forward currency agreements are recorded in either other current assets or accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the company reclassified a loss of approximately $0.8 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other (income) expense, net or cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statement of Income as hedged intercompany balances were settled and as anticipated currency needs arose. This reclassification was net of approximately $0.3 million of associated tax effects., 262982=The company's margins and net income are driven by the company's ability to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. The company's ability to improve sales over time depends in part upon its ability to successfully develop and market new products. In this regard, the company has strategically increased funding of research and development activities, with a focus on products and markets that are growing faster than 8%. For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, the company spent approximately $31.6 million on research and development, an increase of approximately 45% from research and development spending of approximately $21.8 million in the second quarter ended June 30, 2003. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the company spent approximately $54.8 million on research and development, an increase of approximately 33% from research and development spending of approximately $41.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. In light of the complexity of the process of developing and bringing new products to market, the company expects a lag of as much as several years before the results of the increased research and development spending are reflected in increased net sales. In addition, there can be no assurance that research and development activities will successfully generate new products at all or that new products will be successful., 329228=During 2003, the company applied for a Malaysian high-technology pioneer grant that would provide for a full tax exemption by Malaysian Inland Revenue for five years. On February 11, 2004, the company was notified by the Malaysian Ministry of International Trade and Industry that the company's application was accepted and would be effective retroactive to July 1, 2003. The company recorded a tax credit of approximately $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2004 related to the retroactive effective date of this grant., 103227=Balance at January 1, 196373=Goodwill as of June 30, 2004, 198241=2005, 376018=June 1 - June 30, 2004, 238448=2004, 143963=Other Postretirement Benefit Plans - The company does not provide subsidized postretirement health care benefits and life insurance coverage except to a limited number of former employees. Approximately thirty of those former employees receive a limited prescription drug plan. The components of net periodic benefit expense for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 are as follows., 413218=1999, 296273=Consolidated net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of basic drainage products increased 6% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's second quarter. Consolidated net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of infection control products grew 15% on a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year's second quarter. Consolidated net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 of basic drainage products increased 7% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's first six months. Consolidated net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 of infection control products grew 13% on a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year's first six months., 7113=- June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, 48618=Six Months Ended June 30, 2004, 413034=2000, 338397=The following table provides cash flow data for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003., 315559=Interest expense - Interest expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 decreased slightly to $3.0 million from $3.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2004 increased slightly to $6.4 million from $6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003., 363175=In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. These notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming these notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes approximates $157.2 million at June 30, 2004., 199847=Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt - The company maintains a commercial paper program and a committed credit facility that supports the company's commercial paper program. The committed facility may also be used for other corporate purposes. In the second quarter, the company replaced its $200.0 million five-year committed credit facility that would have matured in May of 2005 and its $100.00 million 364-day committed credit facility that matured in May of 2004 with a new $400.0 million committed credit facility that matures in May of 2009. A pricing grid based on the company's long-term credit ratings determines interest rates and facility fees for the new facility. The new facility does not require compensating balances. Total commercial paper borrowings were approximately $60.8 million at June 30, 2004. At December 31, 2003 there were commercial paper borrowings of $15.7 million. Certain of the company's debt agreements contain customary representations, warranties and default provisions as well as restrictions that, among other things, require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense and limit the amount of debt that the company may have outstanding. As of June 30, 2004, the company was in compliance with all such financial covenants., 153928=Employer Contribution to Defined Benefit and Other Postretirement Plans - The company's objective in funding its domestic tax-qualified plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of ERISA. Outside the United States, the company's objective is to fund the international retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions. The company's annual funding decisions also consider the relationship between each tax-qualified plan's asset returns compared to the plan's corresponding expense and consider the relationship between each tax-qualified plan's ABO and its corresponding funded status. From time to time, the company contributes additional amounts as it deems appropriate. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, the company made no contributions to its U.S. tax qualified plan. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, the company made voluntary contributions of $0.8 million and $0.8 million to the company's U.K. tax-qualified plans, respectively. The nonqualified plans and the other postretirement plans are generally not funded., 378609=Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized., 322584=Legal settlements - In the second quarter of 2004, the company paid $10.5 million to settle an intellectual property dispute related to certain of the company's laparoscopic irrigators. In the first quarter of 2004, the company settled certain commercial litigation related to the company's brachytheraphy business and, accordingly, reversed $16.0 million of a $58.0 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 related to this litigation. In addition, during the first quarter of 2004, the company recorded $3.9 million related to an unrelated legal settlement., 294183=Consolidated net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of graft products increased 19% on a reported basis (16% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's second quarter. United States net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of graft products grew 20% compared to the prior year's second quarter. Consolidated net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 of graft products increased 19% on a reported basis (14% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's first six months. United States net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 of graft products grew 17% compared to the prior year's first six months., 174998=Bridger, Inc. - On June 30, 2004, the company acquired the stock of Bridger, Inc., a supplier of components for the company's soft tissue repair franchise. The acquisition agreement called for a cash payment of $8.1 million plus two anniversary payments of $8.1 million each payable in eighteen and thirty-six months and the assumption of certain liabilities. The company recorded the anniversary payments in \"other long-term liabilities\". The company recorded approximately $21.2 million in patents which will be amortized over their useful lives, approximately 15 years. In addition, the company recorded approximately $9.3 million in non-tax deductible goodwill, approximately $0.7 million in in-process research and development and miscellaneous assets and liabilities, primarily consisting of a deferred tax liability. The company has not finalized the purchase price allocation for the Bridger acquisition; however, the company does not expect any change in the Bridger purchase price allocation to have a material impact on its financial statements., 157154=2004, 412776=2002, 430104=SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, 330658=The company believes that certain items recorded in other (income) expense, net, one of which was a legal settlement that resulted in a charge of $10.5 million pretax and an investment gain that resulted in a gain of $6.2 million pretax in the quarter ended June 30, 2004, impact the comparability of the company's results of operations between the periods presented in that table. The company believes that the legal settlements recorded in other (income) expense, net, one of which resulted in a gain of $16.0 million pretax and one of which resulted in a charge of $3.9 million pretax in the quarter ended March 31, 2004, also impact the comparability of the company's results of operations between the periods presented in that table., 369951=On March 16, 2004, Rochester Medical Corporation, Inc. filed a complaint against the company, another manufacturer and two group purchasing organizations under the caption Rochester Medical Corporation, Inc. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 304 CV 060, United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas). The plaintiff alleges that the company and the other defendants conspired to exclude it from the market and to maintain the company's market share by engaging in a variety of conduct in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The plaintiff also has asserted claims for business disparagement, common law conspiracy and tortious interference with business relationships. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and money damages in an unspecified amount. The company intends to vigorously defend this matter. Because the litigation is in a preliminary stage, the company cannot assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential damages. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations in a future period or the company's financial condition., 28531=2004, 176086=Source Tech Medical, L.L.C. - In June 2003, Bard acquired the assets of Source Tech Medical, L.L.C. (\"Source Tech\"), a manufacturer and distributor of radioactive iodine seeds, for approximately $35.0 million in cash and assumed liabilities. The acquisition expanded and integrated the company's presence in the brachytherapy market. The company allocated approximately $7.0 million to tangible assets (primarily equipment and inventory), $17.0 million to technology-related intangible assets, $10 million to tax-deductible goodwill and $1.0 million to in-process research and development. In addition, $2.0 million of pre-existing Source Tech licenses were reclassified to tax-deductible goodwill. Intangible assets will be amortized over a 10-15 year period. The company took into consideration its pre-existing distribution agreement with Source Tech when determining the purchase price allocation and residual goodwill., 341027=Operating activities - For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the company generated $108.3 million cash flow from operations, $12.2 million more than the cash flow from operations reported for the six months ended June 30, 2003. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, net income of $130.6 million increased $34.2 million over net income reported for the six months ended June 30, 2003. Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were $47.1 million and $30.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Depreciation expense was approximately $18.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and $14.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. Amortization expense was approximately $8.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and $6.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003., 331456=The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, investments in businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided from operations continues to be the company's primary source of funds. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms.

To date the company has paid $6.5 million to this entity in connection with this arrangement.

Compensation costs that have been charged against income related to certain of the company's plans would not be materially different under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\"FAS\") No. 123 \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation\" (\"FAS 123\"). No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for employee option grants, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Additionally, in accordance with APB 25 and related interpretations, the company recognizes no compensation expense for the discount associated with the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan of C. R.

The company was required to apply FIN 46R to variable interests in variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") commencing with the quarter ended March 31, 2004. For any VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that were created before January 1, 2004, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the VIE initially would be measured at their fair values with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. If determining the initial fair values is not practicable, fair market value at the date FIN 46R first applies may be used to measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the VIE. The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating a VIE do not represent additional claims on Bard's general assets, rather, they represent claims against the specific assets of the VIE. Conversely, assets recognized as a result of consolidating aVIE do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against Bard's general assets., 274024=For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, Bard's United States net sales of $290.6 million increased 16% over United States net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 of $250.4 million.

Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In particular, in accordance with FIN 46R, the company consolidates financial information related to a variable interest entity. See \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Variable Interest Entities\". While the company's disclosure controls and procedures encompass the company's consolidation of the financial information related to the variable interest entity, the company does not have oversight over the entity's internal control processes. The company's management, with the participation of the company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company's disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2004. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of the company's disclosure controls and procedures provided reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to accomplish their objectives., 28736=2003, 198628=2008, 266433=Bard reported consolidated net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of $416.3 million, an increase of 18% on a reported basis (15% on a constant currency basis) over consolidated net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 of $354.2 million.

Results of operations from these transactions are included in the company's consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition. Several of the company's recent acquisitions and investments involve milestone payments associated with the achievement of certain targets associated either with research and development, regulatory approval or the transfer of manufacturing capabilities. A summary of contingent milestone payments associated with these acquisitions is included below., 304000=For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, the company's soft tissue repair product offerings comprised 72% of consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products.

C. R. Bard, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 304 CV 060, United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas). The plaintiff alleges that the company and the other defendants conspired to exclude it from the market and to maintain the company's market share by engaging in a variety of conduct in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The plaintiff also has asserted claims for business disparagement, common law conspiracy and tortious interference with business relationships. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and money damages in an unspecified amount. The company intends to vigorously defend this matter. Because the litigation is in a preliminary stage, the company cannot assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential damages. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations in a future period or the company's financial condition., 223035=June 30, 2004 notional amount, 103630=Balance at June 30, 5570=Outstanding at July 26, 2004, 85712=2004, 12059=December 31, 2003, 297069=Consolidated net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of urological specialties, which includes brachytherapy products and services, grew 2% on a reported basis (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's second quarter.

FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation as originally provided by FAS 123. Additionally, FAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transitional requirements of FAS\u00a0148 are effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The company adopted the disclosure portion of this statement beginning in the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2003. The application of the disclosure portion of this standard had no impact on the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. On April 22, 2003, the FASB determined that stock-based compensation should be recognized as a cost in the financial statements and that such cost should be measured according to the fair value of stock options. The FASB issued an exposure draft, \"Share-Based Payment, an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and 95\" on June 30, 2004.

Consolidated net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of endovascular products increased 52% on a reported basis (46% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's second quarter. Consolidated net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 of endovascular products increased 55% on a reported basis (46% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's first six months.

The company saw strong performance in the quarter ended June 30, 2004 from net sales of PTA catheter products, which grew over 54% on a reported basis (49% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's second quarter. For the first six months ended June 30, 2004, net sales of PTA catheter products grew 57% on a reported basis (50% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's first six months.

For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, peripherally inserted central catheters (\"PICCs\") continued their strong performance with growth of approximately 42% on a reported basis (41% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's second quarter.

The company continues to see the PICC market expand as these products are being used more frequently in place of intravenous catheters. In 2003, the company introduced its new Hemosplit\u00ae dialysis access catheter with its proprietary split tip design. This catheter entered the market in June of 2003 and has met with strong demand. Consolidated net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of dialysis catheters grew 43% on a reported basis (42% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's second quarter. For the first six months ended June 30, 2004, consolidated net sales of specialty access products were $144.8 million and comprised 74% of the oncology product group. Consolidated net sales of specialty access products for the first six months ended June 30, 2004 increased 26% on a reported basis (23% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's first six months. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, PICCs grew approximately 36% on a reported basis (35% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's first six months., 312117=Cost of goods sold - The company's cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was 40.6%, a reduction of 2.5% from the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 of 43.1%. The company's cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was 40.8%, a reduction of 2.5% from the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2003 of 43.3%. The primary reason for this lower cost of goods sold was manufacturing efficiencies driven by higher production volumes and continued manufacturing cost improvement projects. Due to continuing manufacturing efficiencies, the company expects its cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to modestly decline in 2004., 343072=Financing activities - For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the company generated $23.9 million in cash from financing activities, $23.6 million more than the $0.3 million generated from financing activities reported for the six months ended June 30, 2003.

Total debt was $212.5 million and $184.4 million at June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Total debt to total capitalization was 15.1% and 15.5% at June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of most foreign subsidiaries are consolidated as of and for the three and six months ended May 31, 2004 and as of November 30, 2003. No events occurred related to these foreign subsidiaries during the months of June 2004, December 2003 or June 2003 that materially affected the financial position or results of operations of the company as of the date, or for the periods for which financial information is presented in these financial statements. See below for the impact of the company's adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (\"ARB\") No. 51 (revised December 2003)., 127490=For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the per share fair market value of stock options granted was $17.31, reflecting the company's stock split. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the per share fair market value of stock options granted, without reflecting the company's stock split, was $16.54. The pro forma after-tax adjustment for options assumes vesting periods between two to four years. The fair market value of the ESPP discount is based upon the difference between the market price at the time of purchase and the participant's purchase price. The ESPP pro forma adjustment assumes immediate expense recognition at the time of purchase. All pro forma adjustments have been tax-affected at 35%. No other pro forma adjustments are required because the company records compensation expense for all other stock awards., 69412=Balance at December 31, 2002, 123699=For the Six Months Ended June 30,, 312952=Marketing, selling and administrative expense - The company's marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was 31.3%, an increase of 0.3% over the marketing, selling and administrative costs for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 of 31.0%. The company's marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was 31.0%, consistent with the marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2003 of 31.0%., 341916=Investing activities - For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the company used $111.1 million in cash for investing activities, $17.9 million more than the $93.2 million used for investing activities reported for the six months ended June 30, 2003. Capital expenditures amounted to $35.9 million and $30.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2004 in capital expenditures was principally for the ongoing implementation of the company's enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") information system. The company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $80.0 million in 2004 as additional investments will be made in information technology systems and facilities. The company spent approximately $83.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and $62.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 for the acquisition of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items to augment its existing product lines. These cash expenditures were financed primarily with cash from operations and short-term borrowings., 373246=February 1 - February 29, 2004, 412905=2001, 429914=EXHIBIT 32.1 SECTION 1350 CERTIFICATIONS, 157294=2003, 426390=Date: July 30, 2004, 378209=Exhibit 32.2 - Section 1350 Certification of Chief Financial Officer, 177042=Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets - In July 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 142, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" (\"FAS 142\"). FAS 142 was effective for the company as of January 1, 2002. FAS 142 specifies the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are no longer required to be amortized but rather are to be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets have been recorded at either incurred or allocated cost. Allocated costs were based on respective fair market values at the date of acquisition., 253366=The company adopted the provisions of FIN 46R as of March 31, 2004. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the company recorded approximately $0.5 million in research and development expense and a credit of approximately $0.5 million in other (income) expense, net for noncontrolling interest related to the variable interest entity discussed above. The company recorded the following adjustments to its consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2004 in connection with this variable interest entity:, 345444=The company has $150.0 million of unsecured notes outstanding at June 30, 2004. The notes mature in 2026 and pay a semi-annual coupon of 6.70%. The coupon interest closely approximates the effective annual cost of the notes. The 6.70% notes due 2026 may be redeemed at the option of the note holder on December 1, 2006, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. Assuming these notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes approximates $157.2 million at June 30, 2004., 315091=For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the company made three milestone payments for third-party research and development milestones. The company paid $3.0 million in connection with a milestone related to its urethral bulking project in the second quarter of 2003. In the first quarter of 2003, the company paid $3.0 million in connection with its PTA catheter development project and $1.6 million in connection with its pain management pump program., 213624=Financial Instruments - The fair market value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and short-term debt approximate their carrying value due to their short-term maturities. Short-term investments that have original maturities of ninety days or less are considered cash equivalents and amounted to $404.8 million and $388.4 million as of June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. Short-term investments that are not cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates their market value., 258337=In addition to the variable interest entity discussed above, the company believes it has potential variable interest with one supplier. The long-standing agreement the company has with this supplier did not contemplate or require the exchange of financial or operational data, and the company, after exhaustive efforts, has been unable to obtain sufficient information to determine whether Bard, in fact, has a variable interest in the supplier. The company presently believes it has no exposure to losses resulting from its involvement with this entity. The company has purchased $3.7 million of raw materials from this supplier during the six months ended June 30, 2004., 710=SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 24226=600,000,000 shares at June 30, 2004 and 300,000,000 shares at December 31, 2003; issued and outstanding 104,722,668 shares at June 30, 2004 and 51,754,871 shares at December 31, 2003, 128336=Defined Benefit Pension Plans - The company has both tax qualified and nonqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans (\"nonqualified plans\") that together cover substantially all domestic and certain foreign employees. These plans provide benefits based upon a participant's compensation and years of service. The nonqualified plans are made up of the following arrangements: a nonqualified supplemental deferred compensation arrangement and a nonqualified excess pension deferred compensation arrangement. The nonqualified supplemental deferred compensation arrangement is noncontributory and provides supplemental income to key executives of the company. The benefit is determined by the accumulation of an account balance that results from a percentage of pay credit and interest. No deferrals of pay are required from participants. The balance is paid to a participant after retirement over a 15-year period. The nonqualified excess pension deferred compensation arrangement provides benefits to key employees that cannot be provided by the qualified plan due to IRS limitations. The company uses a September 30 measurement date for all of its defined benefit pension plans. The components of net periodic benefit expense for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 are as follows., 345944=At June 30, 2004, the company's long-term debt was rated \"BBB+\" by Standard and Poor's and \"Baa2\" by Moody's and the company's commercial paper ratings were \"A-2\" by Standard and Poor's and \"P-2\" by Moody's. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility., 366317=There was no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting (other than the ongoing implementation of its new ERP information system discussed above) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting., 212328=Concentration Risks - Financial instruments, which potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash investments and trade accounts receivable. The company maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments and certain other financial instruments with various major financial institutions. The company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. Concentrations of risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. However, a significant amount of trade receivables are with national health care systems in several countries. Although the company does not currently foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables, repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of those countries' national economies. Sales to distributors, which supply the company's products to many end-users, accounted for approximately 35% of the company's net sales in 2003, and sales to the five largest distributors, including the company's Medicon joint venture, combined accounted for approximately 71% of such sales., 314600=For the quarter ended June 30, 2004 the company recorded in-process research and development expense of $6.7 million related to the acquisition of the assets of Onux, Inc. and the stock of Bridger, Inc. For the quarter ended June 30, 2003 the company recorded in-process research and development expense of $1.0 million related to the acquisition of the assets of Sourcetech, Inc. See the discussion in Acquisitions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements., 50477=Balance at December 31, 2003, 289966=Vascular Products - Bard markets a wide range of products for the peripheral vascular market, including endovascular products, electrophysiology products and graft products. Consolidated net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of vascular products increased 32% on a reported basis (27% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's second quarter. United States net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of vascular products grew 43% compared to the prior year's second quarter. International net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 increased 22% on a reported basis (13% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's second quarter. Consolidated net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 of vascular products increased 34% on a reported basis (27% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's first six months.

International net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 increased 28% on a reported basis (16% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year's first six months. The vascular group is the company's most global business, with international net sales comprising 47% of consolidated net sales of vascular products for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2004.}",
