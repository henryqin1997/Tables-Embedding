    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6687=In a further embodiment of the invention at least one of the field mirrors of the field lens group is shaped as an inclined aspheric mirror. This allows the design of the field mirrors, which control the uniformity of the scan energy as well as the telecentricity in the object plane and the illumination of the exit pupil of the illumination system. Especially the imaging of the secondary light sources to the exit pupil of the illumination system and especially the problem of \u03c3-variations can be improved by the present embodiment, which will be described in detail based on the following example of an inventive illumination system. The illumination system as shown in FIG. 13 comprises a nested collector 503 with eight cups. The first optical element 502 comprises 122 first raster elements with an extension of 54 mm\ufffd2.75 mm each. Each raster element produces a secondary light source. The second optical element 504 comprises at least 122 second raster elements which are associated with the first raster elements having a diameter of 10 mm each and being located in the vicinity of the secondary light sources. The second raster elements of the second optical element 504 are projected through the mirrors 506, 508 and 510, which form the field lens group, into the entrance pupil E of the downstream projection lens 526. The projection lens 526 comprises six mirrors 528.1, 528.2, 528.3, 528.4, 528.5, 528.6. According to the present embodiment of the invention, at least one of the field mirrors of the field lens group (506, 508 and 510) is shaped as an inclined aspheric mirror. The projection lens 526 projects the ring field in the object plane 514 into an image field in an image plane 524 in which the object to be illuminated is situated. The structure-bearing mask is arranged in the object plane 514. The system as shown in FIG. 13 is designed for a field radius of R=130 mm at an illumination aperture of NA=0.03125 in the object plane 514, i.e. on the reticle, according to a filling ratio of \u03c3=0.5 in the entrance pupil E of a downstream 4:1 projection lens with an aperture of NA=0.25 in the image plane 524 of the object to be illuminated. As stated above, since at least one of the field mirrors of the field lens group, preferably field mirror 510, is shaped as an inclined aspheric mirror, it is possible to fulfill requirements being at cross-purposes, namely a highly uniform scan energy of the illuminated field in the object plane 514, a high telecentricity in the image plane 524 and a preferred illumination of the exit pupil of the illumination system, which coincidences with the entrance pupil E of the downstream projection lens 526. The uniformity requirement has been explained in detail in the foregoing. The telecentricity requirements shall be understood as being the requirements placed on the principal ray of the illumination at each field point in the illuminated region of the field plane 514. The principal ray is the energetic mean over all illumination beams, which pass through a field point. Generally, a telecentric beam path in the plane of the substrate to be illuminated is desirable for projection lithography, i.e. in the image plane 524, so that no distortion errors are obtained in the defocusing of the substrate to be illuminated. This means that in the image plane the principal rays of a light bundle, which penetrate an image point should extend substantially parallel to the optical axis, with the deviation being less than 10 mrad for example. To ensure that the principal rays extend in a telecentric fashion in the image plane 524 they must be set in the object plane 514 to respective angles which can be found easily by reverse beam tracing of the beam bundles through the projection lens 526. A specific progress of the angles of the principal rays in the field plane 514 is thus obtained which must be produced by the illumination system. The imaging of the secondary light sources in the entrance pupil E of the projection lens 526, which coincides with the exit pupil of the illumination system, must be corrected very well. In particular, coma errors must not occur. If the imaging scale would not be constant over the angle of radiation, i.e. the pupil would appear differently large for different field points in the field to be illuminated. This would correspond to a \u03c3-variation. A \u03c3-variation is a variation of the divergence angle of the illumination beams on the reticle over the field, with a usually stating in the case of conventional circular illumination the ratio from the sine of the maximum angle \u2202bel of the illumination beams with respect to the optical axis and the sine of the maximum acceptance angle An of the projection lens 526. The maximum aperture angle of the projection lens 526 can also be described by the input-side numerical aperture of the projection lens NAEIN=sin \u2202in. The sine of the maximum angle of the illumination beams concerning the optical axis is described by the numerical aperture NAbel=sin \u2202bel, so that the following applies: \u03c3=NAbel/NAEIN. For EUV systems it typically applies that \u03c3=0.5\u20130.8, with the \u03c3-value being changeable by a variable or exchangeable diaphragm for example and with a \u03c3-variation over the field of over 10% for example. In order to obtain increasingly smaller structure widths at low variation of the structure widths over the image field it is necessary that the \u03c3-variation is substantially lower, e.g. less than 2%. It has to be noted that for state of the art systems the homogeneity in the field plane to be illuminated is impaired with a sine-corrected field lens or field mirror system because such a sine-corrected field group will lead to a homogeneous field illumination only with Lambert's reflection characteristics of the secondary light source. Although it is possible in the case of any other reflection characteristics to control the homogeneity of the illumination in a plane by means of a purposeful deviation from the sine correction and thus to optimize the same, as is disclosed for example by DE 10138 313 A1 or the U.S. application Ser. No. 10/216,547, as filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on 9 Aug. 2002, the scope of disclosure of which is hereby fully included in the present application. This homogenization of the illumination generally leads to the \u03c3-variation over the field as described above. The condition that a homogenized illumination occurs in a condenser lens system only in connection with a Lambert radiator applies in the strict sense only by neglecting reflection and transmission losses. In reality, the ideally desired reflection characteristics of the first optical element 502 can be numerically calculated by reverse beam tracing from the image plane 524. Such numerical calculations are within the field of the expert knowledge of a person skilled in the art.}",
