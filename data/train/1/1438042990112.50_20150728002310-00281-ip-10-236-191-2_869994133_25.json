New Surroundings: LIU-Brooklyn has played at Maryland this season (the Blackbirds lost 91-74), but playing at Kentucky will be a step up in competition - one that LIU's players never have experienced. LIU hasn't faced a Top 10 opponent in the regular season since 1997, when it opened the season at No. 6 Purdue and lost 115-95. That said, the Blackbirds - despite this season's slow start - are accustomed to winning. LIU is one of 21 Division I teams with 25 or more wins in both of the past two seasons., 51738=Last meeting: Kentucky 66, LIU 62, March 17, 1947 (Madison Square Garden, New York City; NIT quarterfinal) Wallace \"Wah Wah\" Jones scored 20 points and Ralph Beard added 16 to help the Wildcats hold off a furious rally by Long Island. The Cats led 49-30 with 5:30 to play, but the Blackbirds - even without benefit of a three-point shot - chipped away by turning UK turnovers into baskets. Dick Houlb led LIU with 21 points. The Blackbirds' lone win against Kentucky came on Jan. 4, 1938, when LIU - playing at home - romped Adolph Rupp's Cats 52-34., 60504=Top 10 upsets: A November to remember}",

And while UK will be the favorite Friday, the Cats learned they can't take any team lightly after a scare from Morehead State. UK takes on an 0-3 LIU Brooklyn team, whose three losses came to the three teams UK has beaten this year, Maryland, Lafayette and Morehead State. It's the final game for both teams in the Barclays Center Classic.",
