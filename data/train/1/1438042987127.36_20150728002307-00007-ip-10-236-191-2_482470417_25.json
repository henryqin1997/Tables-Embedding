    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{49070=A role for PARP-1 has also been demonstrated in certain vascular diseases, septic shock, ischaemic injury and neurotoxicity (Cantoni, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1014, 1-7 (1989); Szabo, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100, 723-735 (1997)). Oxygen radical DNA damage that leads to strand breaks in DNA, which are subsequently recognised by PARP-1, is a major contributing factor to such disease states as shown by PARP-1 inhibitor studies (Cosi, et al., J. Neurosci. Res., 39, 38-46 (1994); Said, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 93, 4688-4692 (1996)). More recently, PARP has been demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of haemorrhagic shock (Liaudet, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 97(3), 10203-10208 (2000))., 95820=The HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway repairs double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA via homologous mechanisms to reform a continuous DNA helix (K. K. Khanna and S. P. Jackson, Nat. Genet. 27(3): 247-254 (2001)). The components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway include, but are not limited to, ATM (NM\u2014000051), RAD51 (NM\u2014002875), RAD51L1 (NM\u2014002877), RAD51C (NM\u2014002876), RAD51L3 (NM\u2014002878), DMC1 (NM\u2014007068), XRCC2 (NM\u2014005431), XRCC3 (NM\u2014005432), RAD52 (NM\u2014002879), RAD54L (NM\u2014003579), RAD54B (NM\u2014012415), BRCA1 (NM\u2014007295), BRCA2 (NM\u2014000059), RAD50 (NM\u2014005732), MRE11A (NM\u2014005590) and NBS1 (NM\u2014002485). Other proteins involved in the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway include regulatory factors such as EMSY (Hughes-Davies, et al., Cell, 115, pp 523-535). HR components are also described in Wood, et al., Science, 291, 1284-1289 (2001)., 162147=Suitable carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts. See, for example, \u201cHandbook of Pharmaceutical Additives\u201d, 2nd Edition (eds. M. Ash and I. Ash), 2001 (Synapse Information Resources, Inc., Endicott, New York, USA), \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d, 20th edition, pub. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; and \u201cHandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients\u201d, 2nd edition, 1994., 50707=PARP inhibitors are also thought to be relevant to the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (Szabo C., Role of Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Activation in the Pathogenesis of Shock and Inflammation, In PARP as a Therapeutic Target; Ed J. Zhang, 2002 by CRC Press; 169-204), ulcerative colitis (Zingarelli, B, et al., Immunology, 113(4), 509-517 (2004)) and Crohn's disease (Jijon, H. B., et al., Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol., 279, G641-G651 (2000)., 251833=To a solution of tert-butyl chloroacetate (31)(4.5 g, 29.7 mmol) in dry DMF (50 ml) was added Hunig's base (6.28 mL, 36.0 mmol) followed by potassium carbonate (5.24g, 38.0 mmol). The mixture was heated to 90\ufffd C. before DL-alanine methyl ester (32A)(4.55 g, 37.2 mmol) dissolved in DMF (10 ml) was added dropwise over 1 hour. The heating was continued for a further 1 hour and the reaction cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was then diluted with water (70 ml) and extracted with DCM (3\ufffd50 ml). The combined organics were then dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to dryness in vacuo. The resultant oil was purified by flash chromatography eluent 5:1 hexane/ethyl acetate, Rf of 0.19, staining blue with \u2018Anisaldehyde stain\u2019. 3.5 g of colourless oil was obtained. Assumed to be 100% pure and taken on to next step without any further analysis., 338075=The Potentiation Factor (PF50) for compounds is calculated as a ratio of the IC50 of control cell growth divided by the IC50 of cell growth+PARP inhibitor. Growth inhibition curves for both control and compound treated cells are in the presence of the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The test compounds were used at a fixed concentration of 0.2 or 0.5 micromolar. The concentrations of MMS were over a range from 0 to 10 \u03bcg/ml. Cell growth was assessed using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (Skehan, P., et al., (1990) New colorimetric cytotoxicity assay for anticancer-drug screening. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82, 1107-1112). 2,000 HeLa cells were seeded into each well of a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate in a volume of 100 \u03bcl and incubated for 6 hours at 37\ufffd C. Cells were either replaced with media alone or with media containing PARP inhibitor at a final concentration of 0.5, 1 or 5 \u03bcM. Cells were allowed to grow for a further 1 hour before the addition of MMS at a range of concentrations (typically 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 \u03bcg/ml) to either untreated cells or PARP inhibitor treated cells. Cells treated with PARP inhibitor alone were used to assess the growth inhibition by the PARP inhibitor., 93801=In particular, compounds as defined in the first aspect of the invention can be used in anti-cancer combination therapies (or as adjuncts) along with alkylating agents, such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), temozolomide and dacarbazine (DTIC), also with topoisomerase-1 inhibitors like Topotecan, Irinotecan, Rubitecan, Exatecan, Lurtotecan, Gimetecan, Diflomotecan (homocamptothecins); as well as 7-substituted non-silatecans; the 7-silyl camptothecins, BNP 1350; and non-camptothecin topoisomerase-I inhibitors such as indolocarbazoles also dual topoisomerase-I and II inhibitors like the benzophenazines, XR 11576/MLN 576 and benzopyridoindoles. Such combinations could be given, for example, as intravenous preparations or by oral administration as dependent on the preferred method of administration for the particular agent., 46555=Poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation has also been associated with malignant transformation. For example, PARP-1 activity is higher in the isolated nuclei of SV40-transformed fibroblasts, while both leukemic cells and colon cancer cells show higher enzyme activity than the equivalent normal leukocytes and colon mucosa (Miwa, et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 181, 313-321 (1977); Burzio, et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Bioi. Med., 149, 933-938 (1975); and Hirai, et al., Cancer Res., 43, 3441-3446 (1983)). More recently in malignant prostate tumours compared to begnine prostate cells significantly increased levels of active PARP (predominantly PARP-1) have been identified associated with higher levels of genetic instability (Mcnealy, et al., Anticancer Res., 23, 1473-1478 (2003)), 44146=This application claims the priority benefits to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. Nos. 60/728,050 filed on Oct. 19, 2005 and 60/822,663 filed on Aug. 17, 2006, and claims the foreign priority benefits to United Kingdom Patent Application No. 0521373.1 filed on Oct. 20, 2005., 329057=To a suspension of 4-(3-isocyanato-benzyl)-2H-phthalazin-1-one (2)(1.4 g, 4.7 mmol) in dry DCM (40 ml) was added D-aspartic acid (0.455 g, 5.0 mmol), followed by triethylamine (1.4 ml, 1.0 mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 4 days. The reaction mixture was then filtered. The filtrate was then diluted with water (20 ml) and washed twice with DCM (2\ufffd20 ml). The combined DCM layers were dried over sodium sulfate and then concentrated in vacuo to afford a crude oil which was subjected to flash chromatography eluent neat ethyl acetate to remove impurity and the then 1:1 ethyl acetate/methanol to remove the desired component. (Rf of 0.2 in 1:1 ethyl acetate methanol). Single peak in LC-MS analysis, (0.79 g) requiring no further purification; m/z (LC-MS, ESP), RT=2.70 (M+H) 384;, 239510=To conc nitric acid (15 mL) was added conc sulphuric acid (15 mL) the mixture was cooled to \u221210\ufffd C. and 2-thiophencarboxyaldehyde (24)(10.0 g, 89.2 mmol) was added dropwise over 15 minutes maintaining the reaction temperature between \u22125\ufffd C. and 0\ufffd C. The mixture was stirred for a further 1 hour before being poured into water (200 mL) and extracted with DCM (3\ufffd100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The crude oil was subjected to flash chromatography, eluent hexane:ether 10:1. The desired isomer (rf 0.32 in 2:1 hexane:ether) was collected. Single peak in LC-MS analysis, (11.5 g, 82% yield) requiring no further purification; m/z (LC-MS, ESP), RT=3.55 mins no ionisation observed in ms; 1H NMR (300 MHz, D6-DMSO) 10.0 (1H, s), 9.2 (1H, s), 8.6 (1H s)., 253215=To a suspension of 4-(3-isocyanato-benzyl)-2H-phthalazin-1-one (2)(3.12 mmol) in dry DCM (80 ml) in the presence of activated 4 \u212b molecular sieves (ca 5 g) was added 2-(tert-butoxycarbonylmethyl-amino)-propionic acid methyl ester (33A)(1.07 g, 4.7 mmol). The reaction was then stirred for 48 hours at ambient temperature. HPLC analysis showed there to a mixture of cyclised and uncyclised ureas 1:1 ratio. The mixture was filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude oil was then subjected to flash chromatography eluent: 1:1 hexane ethyl acetate, Rf=0.09. Single peak in LC-MS analysis, (1.3 g, 95% purity) and required no further purification; m/z (LC-MS, ESP), RT=3.66 mins (M+H) 481\u2014compound cyclised on column, 48517=Furthermore, PARP-1 knockout (PARP -/-) animals exhibit genomic instability in response to alkylating agents and \u03b3-irradiation (Wang, et al., Genes Dev., 9, 509-520 (1995); Menissier de Murcia, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94, 7303-7307 (1997)). More recent data indicates that PARP-1 and PARP-2 possess both overlapping and non-redundant functions in the maintenance of genomic stability, making them both interesting targets (Menissier de Murcia, et al., EMBO. J., 22(9), 2255-2263 (2003))., 97265=The activity of one or more components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway may be abolished in the one or more cancer cells of an individual having a cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair. Components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway are well characterised in the art (see for example, Wood, et al., Science, 291, 1284-1289 (2001)) and include the components listed above.}",
