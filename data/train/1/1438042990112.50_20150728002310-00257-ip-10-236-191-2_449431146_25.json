            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ESTIMATING VANISH POINTS FROM AN IMAGE, COMPUTER PROGRAM AND STORAGE MEDIUM THEREOF - The present invention discloses a method and apparatus for estimating vanish points from an image, computer program and storage medium thereof. One of the method for detecting the vanishing points from an image according to the present invention comprising a dividing step for dividing the image into small patches; a first detecting step for detecting each patch's local orientations; a composing step for composing lines of pencils based on the local orientations detected in the first detecting step; and a first computing step for computing at least one vanishing point based on the lines of pencils composed in said composing step. On the basis of the vanishing points found by the present invention, the perspective rectification on a document image can be executed accurately and fastly.",
            "MEDICAL IMAGE DISPLAY APPARATUS AND METHOD - The present invention discloses a medical image fusion apparatus and method. The medical image fusion apparatus comprises: a display unit configured to display a plurality of medical images in layers in one window on a screen, wherein the arrangement direction of the plurality of medical images is different from the extension direction of the plane on which each medical image exists; an operation detection unit configured to detect an operation of selecting the medical images to be fused from the plurality of medical images; and a fused image generation unit configured to generate a fused image of the medical images to be fused according to the selection operation, wherein the display unit is further configured to display the fused image in a predetermined region in the window."

The pulverized coal boiler comprises a hearth of which the bottom is provided with a slag hole and a tail downward flue of which the lower part is provided with a flue gas outlet. The pulverized coal boiler further comprises a middle flue communicated between the hearth and the tail downward flue, wherein the middle flue comprises an upward flue and a hearth outlet downward flue of which the bottoms are mutually communicated and the upper ends are respectively communicated with the upper end of the hearth and the upper end of the tail downward flue to form a U-shaped circulation channel. In the pulverized coal boiler provided by the disclosure, the middle flue which extends downwards and can make flue gas flow along the U-shaped circulation channel is arranged between the outlet of the hearth and the tail downward flue, so that high-temperature flue gas from the hearth can be introduced into a position with low elevation through the downward flue, and final-stage convection heating surfaces (such as a high-temperature superheater and a high-temperature reheater) can be arranged at positions with low height, and the length of ultrahigh-temperature steam pipelines between the high-temperature superheater and a steam turbine, and between the high-temperature reheater and the steam turbine can be greatly reduced. Therefore, the manufacturing cost of a",
