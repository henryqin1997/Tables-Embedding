It is only connected to option packs that use the A_OUTR and A_OUTL signals and should route directly to the analog audio section of the option pack 12. A_OUTR and A_OUTL are line out signals from the right and left channels of the main unit's audio codec. These signals correspond directly to the audio signals used for the speaker and headphone outputs of the main unit 10. If an option pack 12 uses these signals, it must amplify them for an option pack audio out function and connect the A_GND signal to the analog ground of the option pack.}",
