    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{78010=Given how abruptly his career ended, Brandon Webb is an overlooked ace of the mid-2000s. The BA Rookie of the Year in 2003, he won the \u201906 NL Cy Young Award and finished runner-up the following two seasons. However, he made only one major league appearance after 2008, when he was 29 years old. In a strange bit of synchronicity, the Diamondbacks selected both Webb and star first baseman Paul Goldschmidt in the eighth round of the draft., 109569=See Also: Rangers Top 10 Prospects Chat with Ben Badler ($) Want More? Complete 2015 Top 10 Prospects Rankings Get it all: Subscribe to Baseball America Go 30 deep: Order [\u2026], 41579=Craig Biggio, Lance Berkman and Roy Oswalt starred for the Astros\u2019 lone NL pennant winner in 2005, though the franchise\u2019s late-\u201990s and early-2000s division winners also received contributions from homegrown closer Billy Wagner (16.0 WAR, 1993, 12th overall) and righthander Shane Reynolds (19.2, 1989, third round)., 52074=The Dodgers\u2019 storied 1968 draft haul includes not only Ron Cey and Steve Garvey, but also second baseman Davey Lopes (32.0 WAR, January secondary, second round). All three teamed up on Los Angels NL pennant winners in 1977-78 and \u201981. Orel Hershiser almost single-handedly guided the light-hitting 1988 Dodgers to a World Series victory, overturning the powerful offenses of the Mets and Athletics to get there. One of the more remarkable draft stories ever, Mike Piazza went from 62nd-round afterthought in 1988 to the all-time leader for home runs by a catcher. He contributed 31.9 WAR to the Dodgers and 27.4 for the Mets and three other teams., 57229=Hall of Famer Greg Maddux produced twice as much WAR for the Braves (66.0) than he did the Cubs, but he did spend the first seven seasons of his storied career with Chicago, leading the club to the 1989 NL East division title (along with Mark Grace). A different pair of young starters\u2014Mark Prior and Kerry Wood\u2014propelled the 2003 Cubs to within a game of the World Series., 43872=The White Sox hit on four straight first-rounders from 1987 to 1990 in Jack McDowell, Robin Ventura, Frank Thomas and righty Alex Fernandez (20.5 WAR, 1990, fourth overall), and that quartet powered Chicago to an AL West division title in 1993. (They led the newly-formed Central at the time of the \u201994 strike, too.) Mark Buehrle was one of the few homegrown stars to grace the postseason roster of the 2005 World Series champs., 59785=No team has made more No. 1 overall draft selections than the Padres (five), and they hit on only one of them when Andy Benes enjoyed his best years in San Diego in the early \u201990s. Finding two of the best right fielders of the Draft Era in Tony Gwynn and Dave Winfield helps mitigate that a bit. Still, the Padres have fared nowhere near as well as the Royals, Expos or Brewers, their 1969 expansion cousins., 73075=This top five is a fine cross-section of the key players for the 2007 NL pennant winners. All they\u2019re missing are lefthander Jeff Francis (10.2 WAR, 2002, ninth overall) and international signee Ubaldo Jimenez. The next position player on the list is center fielder Dexter Fowler (9.6, 2004, 14th round), who won\u2019t be building on his total following his trade to the Astros., 70141=With the exception of Ian Kinsler, much of the talent on the 2010-11 AL pennant winners was acquired by the Rangers in trades. Even the successful late-\u201990s Texas clubs\u2014except for Rusty Greer and righthander Rick Helling (14.0 WAR, 1992, 22nd overall)\u2014were built by means other than the draft, particularly the international free agent market, where the Rangers signed right fielder Juan Gonzalez and catcher Ivan Rodriguez out of Puerto Rico., 54864=Dave Parker and John Candelaria starred on the 1979 World Series champs, while five-tool outfielders (and MVPs) Barry Bonds in 1992 and Andrew McCutchen in 2013 represented end points between the 20-season gap between winning Pirates clubs., 20013=The Tigers acquired much of the core of 1984 World Series champions in the 1974-76 drafts, finding bargains outside the first round with Jack Morris, Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker. In other drafts, Detroit used first-round picks to nab Lance Parrish in 1974 and right fielder Kirk Gibson (27.6 WAR) with the 12th overall pick in 1978. Justin Verlander has pitched in two World Series, owns a Cy Young Award trophy, has all sorts of black ink on his Baseball-Reference page and already is, at age 31, the best pitcher the Tigers have ever drafted., 38861=The Brewers\u2019 track record with first-round position players is not a new phenomenon. In the decades since Paul Molitor and Robin Yount led Milwaukee to the 1982 World Series, the Brewers identified stars such as B.J. Surhoff and Gary Sheffield in the 1980s, Geoff Jenkins in the 1990s and Ryan Braun, Prince Fielder and Rickie Weeks in the 2000s., 4877=Developing an ace the caliber of Cole Hamels and a double-play duo of Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley in the span of seven drafts helps explain how the Phillies won pennants in 2008 and \u201909 in the midst of five straight NL East division titles. (All three remained Phillies five years after the final World Series appearance, too.) Those clubs received contributions from other homegrown stars, most notably left fielder Pat Burrell (16.7 WAR, 1998, first overall) and first baseman Ryan Howard (18.8, 2001, fifth round). For good measure, Philadelphia also drafted two of the best third basemen of the past 50 years, finding both Mike Schmidt and Scott Rolen in the second round. Rolen produced an additional 40.8 WAR for the Cardinals, Reds and Blue Jays after leaving Philadelphia., 16713=The Athletics signed righthander Catfish Hunter, left fielder Joe Rudi and closer Rollie Fingers as amateur free agents in 1964, one year before the first draft, then supplemented the eventual 1972-74 World Series champions with the 1965-67 drafts, taking Sal Bando, Reggie Jackson, lefty Vida Blue (29.1 WAR, 1967, second round) and first baseman Gene Tenace (23.5, 1965, 20th round). Oakland owes much of its early-2000s success to draft picks such as Eric Chavez, first baseman Jason Giambi (28.8, 1992, second round) and back-to-back-to-back hits Tim Hudson (31.0, 1997, sixth round), Mark Mulder (19.7, 1998, second overall) and Barry Zito (30.9, 1999, ninth overall). With three waves of pennant-contending teams in the early \u201970s, late \u201980s and early 2000s, the A\u2019s have perhaps the deepest list of homegrown talent of any organization during the Draft Era., 82479=Draft | #2014 draft #Arizona Diamondbacks #Atlanta Braves #Baltimore Orioles #Boston Red Sox #Chicago Cubs #Chicago White Sox #Cincinnati Reds #Cleveland Indians #Detroit Tigers #Houston Astros #Kansas City Royals #Los Angeles Angels #Los Angeles Dodgers #Miami Marlins #Milwaukee Brewers #Minnesota Twins #Montreal Expos #New York Mets #New York Yankees #Oakland Athletics #Philadelphia Phillies #Pittsburgh Pirates #San Diego Padres #San Francisco Giants #Seattle Mariners #Tampa Bay Rays #Texas Rangers #Toronto Blue Jays #Washington Nationals, 1723=The Red Sox struck gold with a first-round pick once each decade with Jim Rice in the 1970s, Roger Clemens in the 1980s and Nomar Garciaparra in the 1990s. Each would go on to star for some of the most memorable AL pennant winners in franchise history in 1975, 1986 and 2004\u2014though Boston traded Garciaparra before it reached the \u201904 World Series, of course. More remarkably, the Red Sox unearthed premium high school talent outside the top few rounds with fifth-rounder Dwight Evans in 1969 and seventh-rounder Wade Boggs in 1976. So prodigious has been the club\u2019s player-development machine that Hall of Fame catcher Carlton Fisk (39.5 WAR, 1967, fourth overall) could not crack the top five. Same goes (at the moment) for second baseman Dustin Pedroia (39.6, 2004, second round) and lefthander Jon Lester (28.9, 2002, second round), both stalwarts for the 2007 and 2013 World Series champions., 10983=In the span of three years from 1990-92 the Yankees signed Mariano Rivera out of Panama and drafted Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte and Jorge Posada, signing the last two as draft-and-follows taken after the 20th round of the 1990 draft. As a quartet they drove the success of six AL pennant winners from 1998 to 2009. Ron Guidry and Thurman Munson served as homegrown jewels of the 1977-78 World Series winners. First baseman Don Mattingly (42.2 WAR, 1979, 19th round) narrowly missed making the list, though Yankees fans who came of age between the late-\u201970s and late-\u201990s dynasties can continue to carry a torch for the current Dodgers skipper., 64893=The Mariners, expansion cousins of the Blue Jays in 1977, nailed three of the four No. 1 overall picks in franchise history, taking Mike Moore (1981), Ken Griffey Jr. (1987) and Alex Rodriguez (1993), benefiting, of course, from once-a-decade talents like Griffey and A-Rod being available. Seattle signed DH Edgar Martinez and shortstop Omar Vizquel as international free agents and traded for lefty Randy Johnson, making the late-\u201990s teams some of the most talented ever., 22608=The Braves dominated the NL in the 1990s with three stars produced by their scouting and player-development machine\u2014Tom Glavine, Chipper Jones and David Justice\u2014along with shrewd pickups such as righthanders Greg Maddux and John Smoltz and international signings such as center fielder Andruw Jones and catcher Javy Lopez. Atlanta also converted a handful of other draft picks into successful big league regulars, such as lefty Steve Avery (13.5 WAR, 1988, third overall), shortstop Jeff Blauser (20.6, 1984, fifth overall in June secondary), left fielder Ryan Klesko (10.7, 1989, fifth round) and righty Kevin Millwood (13.2, 1993, 11th round)., 30936=Many of the principals for the Cardinals\u2019 three NL pennant winners of the 1980s were imported from other teams, but exceptions include 1982 co-MVP Keith Hernandez and assorted others such as left fielder Vince Coleman (12.0 WAR, 1982, 10th round), righty Bob Forsch (21.5, 1968, 26th round) and third baseman Terry Pendleton (15.0, 1982, seventh round). While Ted Simmons (1968-80) and Ray Lankford (1990-2001, \u201904) played for comparatively fallow periods in franchise history, the same is not true for Albert Pujols and Yadier Molina, who helped drive St. Louis to World Series titles in 2006 and 2011., 27705=Expansion cousins of the Royals in 1969, the Expos experienced similar player-development success, if not the same on-field success as Kansas City. (They never won a playoff series, much less a World Series.) Montreal from 1982-84 featured all five players listed above in regular roles, but still they won no more than 86 games during those three seasons. Gary Carter and Andre Dawson are enshrined in Cooperstown, and Tim Raines has hovered near 50 percent of the vote in each of the past three elections. The top Nationals player on the list is third baseman Ryan Zimmerman (34.2 WAR, 2005, fourth overall), the first player ever drafted by Washington. Other young Nationals stars like shortstop Ian Desmond, left fielder Bryce Harper and righthanders Stephen Strasburg and Jordan Zimmermann are building their cases., 8044=All the stars from the AL pennant-winning Orioles of 1969-71 signed prior to the Draft Era, though 1967 first-rounder Bobby Grich received cups of coffee during the final two years. He didn\u2019t earn regular play until 1972, however, and had moved on to the Angels by the time Baltimore made the 1979 World Series. Eddie Murray starred for the \u201979 Orioles and again for the 1983 World Series winners, alongside Cal Ripken and lefty Mike Flanagan (21.8 WAR, 1973, seventh round). Baltimore came by Mike Mussina by more conventional means, taking him in the first round of the 1990 draft and watching him take flight in the majors the next year. During his seven-year peak from 2003-09, Brian Roberts hit .288/.362/.430 and averaged 34 stolen bases., 25289=Notable members of the Big Red Machine of the 1970s whom the Reds drafted include Johnny Bench, the 36th player ever drafted and the best position player from baseball\u2019s inaugural draft, Gary Nolan, right fielder Ken Griffey Sr. (25.3 WAR, 1969, 29th round) and lefthander Don Gullet (14.1, 1969, 14th overall). Barry Larkin and Eric Davis struck fear in opponents as power/speed players who starred up the middle for the Reds\u2019 World Series winner in 1990. Like Bench (1970, \u201972) and Larkin (1995), Joey Votto (2010) has an MVP award to his credit., 49062=The Angels built their 2002 World Series winners in large part through shrewd drafting, the fruits of their effort including Darin Erstad and Tim Salmon as well as left fielder Garret Anderson (28.0 WAR, 1990, fourth round), third baseman Troy Glaus (22.5, 1997, third overall), righty John Lackey (25.0, 1999, second round) and closer Troy Percival (16.9, 1990, sixth round). In case you\u2019re wondering, center fielder Mike Trout needs another 10 WAR to dislodge Erstad on the list., 13922=The Royals\u2019 appearance here is doubly impressive because as a 1969 expansion team, they (1) did not participate in the first three drafts\u2014and began drafting in the fourth round in 1968\u2014and (2) they traded two of the most talented players they ever drafted to preempt their departures via free agency. Those players would be center fielder Carlos Beltran (24.7 WAR, 1995, second round) and righthander Zack Greinke (26.2, 2002, sixth overall). Elsewhere, George Brett, Mark Gubicza, Bret Saberhagen and Willie Wilson are recognizable as stars of the 1985 World Series champions, along with second baseman Frank White (34.7 WAR), who signed as an amateur free agent in 1970., 36442=Drafted by the Dodgers (did not sign) and Braves (selection voided) in 1965 and \u201966, Tom Seaver joined the organization only after the commissioner conducted a three-team lottery for the USC ace\u2019s services. The three-time Cy Young Award winner still is the only Mets player in the Hall of Fame. First-round picks Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry appeared headed down that path as superstars for the Mets dynasty-that-wasn\u2019t of the 1980s, but late nights and early declines undermined their productivity., 62187=The Giants built three-quarters of an infield using first-round picks from 1983-86, taking in order Robby Thompson, Will Clark and Matt Williams, but fans probably will view the run of first-rounders from 2000-08 more favorably. In that time, San Francisco drafted Matt Cain (2002), righthander Tim Lincecum (2006), lefty Madison Bumgarner (2007) and catcher Buster Posey (2008), the core of the 2010 and 2012 World Series winners., 33689=Bert Blyleven, Kent Hrbek and Kirby Puckett starred for the 1987 World Series champs, along with homegrown lefthander Frank Viola (27.2 WAR, 1981, second round) and third baseman Gary Gaetti (27.1, 1979 June secondary, 11th overall). Rookie of the Year second baseman Chuck Knoblauch (37.9, 1989, 25th overall) and righty Scott Erickson (12.7, 1989, fourth round) chipped in for the 1991 champs. No. 1 overall draft pick, six-time all-star and three-time AL batting champ Joe Mauer could shoot near the top of this list before he\u2019s through., 46472=Just off the list we find homegrown contributors\u2014in addition to Jimmy Key\u2014to the 1992-93 World Series champs: righty Pat Hentgen (26.7 WAR, 1986, fifth round) and first baseman John Olerud (22.5, 1989, third round). Toronto also hit on numerous first-round position players in addition to Vernon Wells, including right fielder Shawn Green (1991), second baseman Aaron Hill (2003), center fielder Lloyd Moseby (1978), right fielder Alex Rios (1999) and left fielder Shannon Stewart (1992). Not bad for a club that didn\u2019t begin drafting until 1977., 67634=The Indians did well to extend the contracts of their mid-\u201990s lineup stalwarts like Albert Belle, Manny Ramirez and Jim Thome before they hit free agency, but they didn\u2019t keep any of them in Cleveland much past the age of 30, and that\u2019s reflected in the relatively low WAR totals. Ace of the 1995 and \u201997 AL pennant winners, Charles Nagy stuck around until age 35, but injuries undercut his final three years with the Indians., 75614=Much as is the case with the Rockies, the Rays\u2019 2008 AL pennant winners are well represented here, especially with top-of-the-draft stars Evan Longoria, David Price and B.J. Upton.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "1. Red Sox Teams are ranked by strength of homegrown hauls during the 1965-to-present Draft Era. A key to the symbols: An asterisk (*) denotes a member of the Hall of Fame; a carrot (^) represents an active player in 2014; a (D/F) designation means the player signed the following year as a draft-and-follow; and to denote the various secondary phases of the draft that existed prior to 1987, we use one cross (\u2020) for the June secondary phase and two crosses (\u2020\u2020) for one of the two January phases. While WAR can only estimate a player\u2019s overall value, you\u2019ll find the results presented here make intuitive sense, and that groups of players with high WAR totals tend to translate into winning seasons, playoff appearances and World Series titles for their teams. So as the 50th draft approaches, let\u2019s take stock of how the 30 teams have fared in this regard, assessing each club\u2019s best-ever homegrown stars who were eligible for the draft. For this exercise we rank players by Wins Above Replacement (Baseball-Reference version) accumulated with the original signing club only. To achieve that outcome, an organization\u2019s amateur scouting department, player-development staff and front office must strike a rare balance. They must find the player, refine him, then keep him around to reap the reward. You can\u2019t have one leg without the other two. Few outcomes in baseball are more aesthetically pleasing than when a club drafts a player, develops him and has him star",
