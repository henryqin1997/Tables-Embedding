The young Kentish Man took 7 for 50 against Hampshire and averaged a respectable 27 with the ball in Championship cricket. He was a regular in both the FL T20 and YB40 sides, claiming 16 wickets altogether in the short forms of the game., 68959=The Cricket Monthly: The IPL lasts two months, but through the year talent hunters are scouring India (and the internet) for the next big thing.

His return of 48 wickets at 32.58 was a solid enough return as he became a key part of Kent's increasingly youthful side. His presence was enough for Tredwell to accept a loan spell at Sussex in mid-season search of one-day cricket, although he returned to the Kent fold at the end of the season.

They settled on Moeen Ali as a spin-bowling allrounder, but as they gazed around the counties for promising young talent many eyes settled on Adam Riley. Peter Such, England's spin bowling coach, was among those who held him in high regard and there was hint of Such, too, in the flight he sought from an upright action., 35034=Education Beths Grammar School, Bexley, 76107=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average}",
