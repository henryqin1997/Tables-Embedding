Pursuant to the terms of the SSP, SSUs share amounts granted on December\u00a031, 2010, and later were determined based on the average of the high and low trading price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on each grant date., 422110=Repurchased 200\u00a0million shares of Common Stock from the UST for $5.5 billion, representing 40 percent of the government\u0092s stake on December\u00a021, 2012, and announced the UST\u0092s plan to sell down its remaining equity over a period of 12 to 15 months; and, 966951=As of December\u00a031, 2012, Mr.\u00a0Lee was eligible to retire pursuant to the provisions of both the qualified SRP and the non-qualified ERP., 417112=Achieved 2012 fiscal year revenue totaling $152.3 billion and Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (\u0093EBIT\u0094)\u0097Adjusted of $7.9 billion on sales of 9.3\u00a0million vehicles;, 97883=Pursuant to the Board\u0092s retirement age policy, Philip A.

This is because we replaced companies with very high or low relative revenues with appropriate companies whose revenues are closer to the group median, while maintaining the core companies in the prior group. The companies which were removed from our peer group were Alcoa Inc., Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Abbott Laboratories, Dell, Inc., and Exxon-Mobil Corporation. Two new companies in the Industrials sector were added to the group, 3M Company and Deere\u00a0& Company., 472339=In 2012, we used a comparator group of 20 companies whose selection was based on the following criteria:, 874924=There were no options granted or exercised or stock awards vested for NEOs during 2012 (table omitted intentionally)., 581896=2012 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE, 1019714=The following Audit Committee Report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this proxy statement or any portion hereof into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed thereunder., 877581=For service rendered January\u00a01, 2007 through September\u00a030, 2012, non-qualified retirement benefits for executive employees were determined under one of two methods (a DB formula or a DC formula), depending on an executive\u0092s length of service date. For executives with a length of service date prior to January\u00a01, 2001 a total benefit accrued (SRP plus ERP) equal to 1.25 percent of monthly base salary and annual General Motors Company Short Term Incentive Plan (the \u0093STIP\u0094). For executives with a length of service date on or after January\u00a01, 2001, total contributions (RSP plus ERP) accrued equal to four percent of monthly base salary and STIP.

Our Board may also establish from time to time any other committees that it deems necessary or desirable. Each member of the Audit, Corporate Governance, and Compensation Committees has been determined by the Board to be independent for purposes of the NYSE Corporate Governance listing standards. The composition of each Committee also complies with the listing requirements and other rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange. The following table shows for each of our standing Committees the current membership and the number of meetings held in 2012., 966671=As of December\u00a031, 2012, Ms.\u00a0Barra was eligible to retire pursuant to the provisions of the qualified SRP, but not the non-qualified ERP., 977642=March\u00a028, 2013, 915677=The General Motors Defined Contribution portion of the Executive Retirement Plan (the \u0093DC ERP\u0094), formerly known as the Benefit Equalization Plan, allows for the equalization of benefits for highly compensated salaried employees under the SRP and the RSP when such employees\u0092 contribution and benefit levels exceed the maximum limitations on contributions and benefits imposed by Section\u00a02004 of ERISA, as amended, and Section\u00a0401(a)(17) and 415 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the \u0093IRC\u0094).

Mullen joined the Board on February\u00a01, 2013 and has not yet been named to any Committees of the Board., 491271=How We Use Comparator Data to Plan Compensation. The benchmarking process we used to assist us in planning NEO compensation for 2012 was derived from the 2011 fiscal year proxy disclosures by our peer companies. Since the 2011 proxy disclosures reflected 2010 total earned compensation, we adjusted this data appropriately for known compensation growth in 2011. It should be noted that, in using this process, the data thus utilized to determine compensation structures for 2012 may not entirely reflect current compensation competitiveness., 967229=Benefits Payable at Death. Upon death of an active employee, we provide a special death payment equal to one month of base salary to certain dependents, including surviving spouses, members of the employee\u0092s family, or other individuals who are to be responsible for payment of funeral expenses. This benefit is provided generally for all salaried employees in active status at the time of death. In addition, pursuant to SRP plan terms we provide eligible surviving spouses a monthly pension benefit based on a percentage of the monthly retirement benefit payable to the employee. Under the terms of the ERP, survivor benefits, if applicable, are payable as a lump sum. Only Mr.\u00a0Lee was vested in the ERP on December\u00a031, 2012, and the lump sum benefit payable to a survivor upon his death on that date was $3,768,164., 124982=Robert D.

Accordingly, during 2012 the compensation structure for these executives continued to include only the following elements:, 1113724=2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ratification of the Selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as GM\u0092s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2013, 91853=The deadline for stockholders to submit a proposal under Rule 14a-8 of the SEC\u0092s proxy rules for inclusion in the Company\u0092s proxy statement for the 2014 annual meeting is December\u00a026, 2013.

Stephens was employed by General Motors LLC until his death in November 2012. Mr.\u00a0Stephens\u0092 family members each received less than $320,000 in total compensation in 2012, and their respective salary and benefits were comparable to those provided to other GM employees in similar positions. Their employment on these terms was approved pursuant to the Company\u0092s Related Party Transactions Policy., 969648=As of December\u00a031, 2012, Mr. Akerson, Mr. Ammann, and Mr. Girsky, had no vested notional contributions in the DC ERP.

This policy requires that during its first meeting of the year, the Audit Committee will be presented, for consideration, a description of the Audit-Related, Tax, and All Other Services expected to be performed by Deloitte during the fiscal year. Any requests for such services for $1\u00a0million or more not contemplated and approved during the first meeting must thereafter be submitted to the Audit Committee (or the Chair of the Audit Committee in an urgent case) for specific pre-approval. Requests for services less than $1\u00a0million individually must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee Chair and reported to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The independent registered public accounting firm selected for the following year presents the proposed annual Audit services and their related fees to the Audit Committee for approval on an audit-year basis., 47467=GM Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be Held on Thursday, June\u00a06, 2013, 423257=Although 2012 was a year marked by areas of significant accomplishment and continued profitability, it was tempered by continuing weakness in Europe.

In this context, management represented to the Committee that the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed by the standards of the PCAOB., 388292=Canada GEN Investment Corporation 1240 Bay Street, Suite 302 Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5R 2A7, 524561=As discussed in the \u00932012 Grants of Plan Based Awards\u0094 table on page 47, two-thirds of the RSUs granted in 2012 to the NEOs will become non-forfeitable on the second anniversary date of the grant and one-third will become non-forfeitable on the third anniversary of the grant date provided that the executive remains continuously employed with GM through that date and the other requirements of the LTIP plan are satisfied. Retiring executives are eligible to receive a prorated portion of their RSU grants after two years of active service. RSUs will be settled when they become non-forfeitable, subject to applicable UST rules. Each RSU represents one share of Common Stock upon settlement. RSUs granted under the plan are subject to recovery or clawback if payments are later found to be based on materially inaccurate financial statements or other materially inaccurate performance metrics, or if the executive is terminated due to any misconduct that occurred during the period in which the incentive was earned., 92628=You may download a copy of GM\u0092s corporate governance documents by visiting our website at www.gm.com/investor, under \u0093Corporate Governance.\u0094 To request a printed copy of any of these documents, write to the Corporate Secretary at General Motors Company, Mail Code 482-C25-A36, 300 Renaissance Center, P.O.

If any non-management directors are not independent, then the independent directors schedule an executive session of independent directors at least once per year. Executive sessions are chaired by the Board\u0092s Lead Director, Ms.\u00a0Russo. During these sessions, the non-management directors review CEO performance, compensation, and succession planning; future Board agendas and flow of information to directors; the Board\u0092s corporate governance matters; and any other matters of importance to the Company or other issues raised by the non-management directors. The non-management directors of the Board met in executive session five times in 2012, including at least one time with only independent directors present., 566296=The 2012 plan reviews were conducted on October\u00a010, 2012 and March\u00a018, 2013. Based on the reviews, the Compensation Committee determined that the 2012 compensation structure appropriately mitigates risk, and we certified to the U.S. Treasury that the design of the compensation structure for our NEOs does not encourage these individuals to take unnecessary or excessive risks that threaten the value of the Company., 1066057=As discussed in the CD&A, the Compensation Committee periodically reviews the NEO\u0092s stock holdings and does not believe that implementing a stock ownership or stock retention requirement is appropriate at this time, based on the compensation structure in place for the NEOs since 2009 and the limited opportunity it provided to accumulate shares of stock in the Company. Under TARP regulations, the annual compensation, 558175=Under its charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to engage outside consultants and advisors at the Company\u0092s expense. During 2012, the Compensation Committee continued to retain the services of CAP to advise the Compensation Committee regarding compensation for the NEOs and certain other compensation related matters. A representative of CAP attends all Compensation Committee meetings, either in person or via telephone conference, consults with and advises Compensation Committee members on executive compensation matters\u0097including the form and amount of various pay elements\u0097as needed, and develops and, 497593=2012 NEO Annual Target Compensation Structure (1), 453249=Currently, annual and long-term incentives are strictly limited by the rules that the UST has promulgated. During 2012 and through today, we increasingly recognized that our need to offer competitive pay, particularly a more appropriate mix of annual cash and non-cash compensation is a growing concern. Such constraints on our ability to compensate critical personnel in a competitive manner inhibits our ability to align incentives and rewards with our business plan, which is fundamental to any successful commercial enterprise, and creates potential recruitment and retention risks at key management levels within the Company. We continue to rely heavily on the loyalty and dedication of our critical personnel and their commitment to optimal execution of the elements of our business plan, notwithstanding the lack of focused incentives. We are concerned, however, that certain key employees, seeing no prospect of change this year, will lose patience and accept opportunities elsewhere., 48438=This proxy statement is provided in connection with the solicitation of proxies, by order of the Board of Directors (the \u0093Board\u0094 or the \u0093Board of Directors\u0094) of General Motors Company, to be used at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders of the Company.

The assessments are intended to assure that, within the limits imposed by the UST rules and the Special Master\u0092s determinations, an appropriate balance has been established between focus on short-term and long-term business performance and between cash and non-cash incentives, to provide adequate current compensation for personal financial security, and to provide incentives to strive for greater team and individual contributions to the continued overall growth of the enterprise., 916555=Aggregate account balances disclosed below include both vested and unvested contributions by GM. Contributions made prior to 2007 were vested immediately. Notional contributions made between January 2007 and September\u00a031, 2012 vest when the participant attains age 55 with ten years of service. Notional contributions made on October\u00a01, 2012 and later vest when the participant attains three years of service, regardless of age. Pursuant to UST regulations, no accruals or contributions to the DC ERP were permitted during 2012 for NEOs who were also SEOs in 2012., 1060156=Indeed, GM\u0092s current policy regarding the separation of the offices of chairman and CEO is consistent with that of most large, publicly traded companies in the United States. According to a 2012 survey of the 100 largest U.S. public, non-controlled companies listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ conducted by Shearman\u00a0& Sterling LLP,, 34298=2012 Summary Compensation Table, 1041317=In 2012, more than 97 percent of the votes cast at the annual meeting were \u0093favorable\u0094 to our Say-on-Pay proposal. With this result in mind and recognizing the continued impact of UST requirements, the Compensation Committee has approved the compensation arrangements described in our CD&A beginning on page\u00a033 for our Named Executive Officers. We urge you to read the CD&A section of this proxy statement for a more complete understanding of our executive compensation plans, including our compensation philosophy and objectives and the 2012 compensation of Named Executive Officers., 973167=The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the CD&A and, based on that review and discussion, has recommended to the Board of Directors that the CD&A be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference in the GM 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K., 296848=Totals for amounts reported as \u0093All Other Compensation\u0094 in the preceding \u00932012 Non-Employee Director Compensation\u0094 table are described below:, 875800=Pension benefits for most of our U.S. executives may be from both tax-qualified plans that are subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u0093ERISA\u0094) and from a non-qualified plan that provides supplemental benefits. We assumed both types of plans from General Motors Corporation in connection with the 363 Sale. Tax-qualified benefits are pre-funded and paid out of either the trust assets of the General Motors Salaried Retirement Program (the \u0093SRP\u0094), the General Motors Retirement Savings Plan for Salaried Employees in the United States (the \u0093RSP\u0094), or both. Non-qualified benefits under the General Motors Executive Retirement Plan (the \u0093ERP\u0094) are not pre-funded and are paid out of our general assets. The ERP provides benefits under both Defined Contribution (\u0093DC\u0094) and Defined Benefit (\u0093DB\u0094) formulas. Benefit accruals and company contributions under GM\u0092s non-qualified pension plan and deferred compensation plans have been suspended for SEOs and certain most highly compensated employees since December\u00a011, 2009., 496104=Our leadership team was selected for their strategic vision and ability to ensure that decisions are implemented quickly and effectively. Based on the compensation objectives and elements described above and the constraints imposed by UST rules and the Special Master, 2012 compensation was established for our NEOs as described below and in the tables that follow this section. Although we reviewed competitive data in developing our total annual compensation recommendations for our NEOs, as a result of the constraints imposed by UST rules and the Special Master, the total target compensation for our CEO in 2012 was unchanged from 2011 and his total target compensation was below the 10th percentile of our comparator group in 2012., 423008=Ended 2012 with total liquidity of $37.2 billion, including $26.1 billion of cash and marketable securities., 525902=Mr.\u00a0Akerson has been our CEO since September 2010 and Chairman of our Board since January 2011. His total compensation has not increased since joining the Company in September 2010 and remains below the 10th percentile for executives in comparable positions due to the restrictions imposed by the Special Master, despite his significant contributions to operating performance and outstanding leadership. However, recognizing the long-term vesting schedule for the RSU portion of compensation, the mix of pay elements was adjusted (while maintaining his total annual compensation at $9 million) to allocate a greater portion of his annual remuneration to SSUs, in acknowledgement of the possibility of his retirement during the three-year vesting period for RSUs. As shown below, his pay as disclosed in the 2012 Summary Compensation Table on page\u00a045 appears to have \u0093increased\u0094 during 2012. Because he will receive no RSU grant for achievement of the 2012 Adjusted FCF performance objective, however, his total compensation for 2012 has not changed from 2011. Additional information regarding Mr.\u00a0Akerson\u0092s realized pay is included on page\u00a034., 450190=Mr.\u00a0Ammann\u0092s SSU grant and RSU grant were increased to bring his total compensation closer to the median pay level for our 2012 compensation comparator group., 423754=2012 Compensation Programs, 246047=In August 2012, the Board approved amendments to the charter of the Finance and Risk Committee, and the Committee was renamed the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight of our financial policies and strategies, including our capital structure. In addition, the Finance Committee periodically receives reports regarding our U.S. employee benefit plans for the purpose of reviewing the administration, financing, investment performance, risk and liability profile, and funding of such plans, in each case including with respect to regulatory compliance. Before the amendments to the charter, the Finance and Risk Committee had responsibility for assisting the Board in its oversight of our risk management strategies and policies, including overseeing management of market, credit, liquidity, and funding risks. These responsibilities have been assumed by the Audit Committee., 825132=On January\u00a011, 2012, the Compensation Committee took action to approve RSU awards to be granted on March\u00a015, 2012 in recognition of 2011 Adjusted FCF performance. The awards were made at the target amount, which is also the maximum amount payable. Pursuant to the terms of the LTIP, the value used to determine the number of RSUs granted on March\u00a015, 2012 was $26.23 based on the average of the high and low trading price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on the grant date. However, the grant date fair, 970283=As of December\u00a031, 2012, Mr.\u00a0Lee had vested notional contributions in the amount of $19,973 in the DC ERP. He had no unvested contributions subject to forfeiture., 16918=At the meeting, stockholders will be asked to vote on the election of directors, the ratification of the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for 2013, an advisory proposal to approve executive compensation, and two stockholder proposals, and to transact any other business that is properly brought before the meeting or any adjournment.

If you plan to attend the meeting, you must request an admission ticket in advance. Please refer to page 5 for further instructions concerning admission tickets. A map and directions are on the back cover of this proxy statement., 337614=No executive officer of GM served on any board of directors or compensation committee of any other company for which any of our directors served as an executive officer at any time during the year ended December\u00a031, 2012., 1037480=All Other Fees: The Company did not engage Deloitte for any significant services for the year ended December\u00a031, 2012., 459495=During 2012, our NEOs were:, 876990=U.S. executive employees must be at least age 55 with a minimum of ten years of eligibility service to be vested in benefits accrued prior to October\u00a01, 2012 in the ERP, and must have been an executive employee on the active payroll of General Motors Corporation as of December\u00a031, 2006 to be eligible for any frozen accrued non-qualified ERP benefit. Benefits accrued in the ERP on and after October\u00a01, 2012 are subject to three-year vesting., 461132=In 2012, the compensation provided to our senior executives was designed to adhere to the six general principles mandated by UST regulations:, 529499=2012 Realized Compensation, 630405=2012 All Other Compensation, 828003=Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 2012, 121060=(\u0093Centerbridge\u0094), an affiliate of Centerbridge Partners, L.P., a private investment firm from 2006 to 2009. From November 2008 to June 2009, Mr.\u00a0Girsky provided advisory services to the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (the \u0093UAW\u0094). Prior to joining Centerbridge, Mr.\u00a0Girsky was a special advisor to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of General Motors Corporation from 2005 to 2006. From 1995 to 2005, he served as Managing Director at Morgan Stanley and a Senior Analyst of the Morgan Stanley Global Automotive and Auto Parts Research Team. Mr.\u00a0Girsky also served as lead director of Dana Holding Corporation (2008 to 2009)., 429419=Mr.\u00a0Akerson\u0092s mix of pay elements was adjusted to allocate a greater portion of his total target remuneration to SSUs (while maintaining his total annual compensation at $9 million), in acknowledgement of the possibility of his retirement before the completion of the three-year vesting period for RSUs. His realized compensation for 2012 (i. e., earned during the fiscal year performance period) is shown in the table below and his compensation structure in 2013 will remain the same as in 2012., 1140050=Thursday, June 6, 2013, 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, 93384=You may download a copy of our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K by visiting our website at www.gm.com/investor, under \u0093Contacts.\u0094 Alternatively, you may request a printed copy by writing to GM Stockholder Services at General Motors Company, Mail Code 482-C25-A36, 300 Renaissance Center, P.O.\u00a0Box\u00a0300, Detroit, Michigan 48265-3000., 16460=You are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of General Motors Company (\u0093GM\u0094 or \u0093General Motors\u0094 or the \u0093Company\u0094 or \u0093we,\u0094 or \u0093our\u0094). It will be held at 9:30\u00a0a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, June\u00a06, 2013, at General Motors Global Headquarters, 300 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243., 89528=If one set of these documents was sent to your household for the use of all GM stockholders in your household and one or more of you would prefer to receive additional sets, or if multiple copies of these documents were sent to your household and you want to receive one set, please contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., by calling toll-free at 800-542-1061, or by writing to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Householding Department, 51\u00a0Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717., 556873=Pursuant to UST regulations, we may deduct 2012 base salaries for NEOs up to an individual maximum of $500,000. We may not take a tax deduction for any other form of compensation for NEOs., 1046442=When our CEO is our board chairman, this arrangement can hinder our board\u0092s ability to monitor our CEO\u0092s performance. Many companies already have an independent Chairman. An independent Chairman is the prevailing practice in the United Kingdom and many international markets. This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at three major U.S. companies in 2012 including 55%-support at Sempra Energy., 1048096=Theodore Solso joined our board in 2012 and brings experience from the D-rated board (by GMI) of Ball Corporation which is aggressive in attempting to avoid shareholder proposals seeking improvement. James Mulva also joined our board in 2012 and brings experience from the D-rated board of General Electric. Thomas Schoewe joined our board in 2011 and brings experience from the D-rated board of Northrop Grumman., 579680=At the 2012 annual meeting, GM stockholders approved the 2011 compensation for our NEOs by a 97.4 percent favorable vote. Noting this level of support and remaining consistent with the UST rules, the Compensation Committee made no material changes to the compensation structures for NEOs for 2012. At the 2013 annual meeting, the Board will again submit a proposal (Item No.\u00a03 \u0096 Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation) enabling stockholders to provide feedback on our compensation policies and practices for our NEOs. The non-binding Say-on-Pay proposal may be found on page\u00a060 of this proxy statement. Our Board and the Compensation Committee intends to review the feedback provided by this stockholder vote and evaluate any significant stockholder concerns as it considers future compensation planning proposals., 1038321=Ratification of the Selection of Deloitte\u00a0& Touche LLP for 2013, 580652=2013 Compensation for Named Executive Officers, 186561=In 2012, our Board held a total of 11 meetings, and average attendance at Board and Committee meetings was 96 percent. Each director attended at least 75 percent of the total meetings of the Board and Committees on which he or she served during 2012, except Mr.\u00a0Bonderman who attended 74 percent (91 percent of Board meetings and 63 percent of Committee meetings). Directors are expected to attend our annual meeting of stockholders, which is held in conjunction with a regularly scheduled Board meeting. All of GM\u0092s directors attended the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders., 917262=SSP\u0097NEOs receive a portion of their total annual compensation in the form of SSUs. The SSUs are granted to NEOs each quarter as described in the \u00932012 Grants of Plan Based Awards\u0094 table on page 47. SSUs are non-forfeitable and become deliverable in three equal installments at each of the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date., 966311=As of December\u00a031, 2012, Mr. Akerson, Mr. Ammann, and Mr. Girsky were not eligible to retire under any qualified or non-qualified retirement plan. Upon termination of employment, their unvested benefits would be forfeited., 874188=The 2010 and 2011 awards are subject to forfeiture for three years. On the third anniversary date of the grant, awards will vest and settle pursuant to the terms of the LTIP., 476751=2012 Comparator Companies, 970588=Incentive Plans. RSUs granted in 2012 vest two-thirds on the second anniversary date of the grant and one-third on the third anniversary of their grant date. Unvested RSUs are forfeited upon termination of employment, except in cases of retirement., 549010=The Special Master determined that no more than $25,000 in perquisites and \u0093Other Compensation\u0094 may be provided to any NEO, absent independent justification and good cause shown. Payments related to expatriate assignments are not included in this total. Detailed disclosure of these items for the NEOs appears in footnote\u00a06 of the \u00932012 Summary Compensation Table\u0094 on page 45., 254748=2012 Non-Employee Director Compensation, 391662=Motors Liquidation Company GUC Trust c/o Wilmington Trust Company, as Trust Administrator Wilmington Trust Company Rodney Square North 1110 North Market Street Wilmington, DE 19890, 1067767=Our NEOs are not allowed to participate in other typical types of incentive plans, which usually include significant grants of Company equity, and we may grant only a limited number of RSUs (no more than one-third of total compensation) that are designed to comply with TARP regulations. Thus, the RSUs granted prior to 2012 are subject to a three-year vesting period and can only be delivered (paid) in accordance with applicable TARP guidelines regarding the repayment of TARP obligations., 384961=The U.S. Department of the Treasury 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, D.C. 20220, 250890=In December 2012, our Board determined to maintain the same level of director compensation (i.e., annual Board and Committee retainers) as originally established on July\u00a010,\u00a02009. Each member of the Board who is not an employee receives an annual retainer of $200,000 for service on the Board and, if applicable, one or both of the following annual retainers: (1)\u00a0$10,000 for service as Chair of any Board Committee; and (2)\u00a0$20,000 for service on the Audit Committee. The fee paid for service as Lead Director is $30,000 per year., 1143327=The undersigned authorizes Daniel F. Akerson, Stephen J. Girsky, and Daniel Ammann, and each of them as the Proxy Committee, to vote the Common Stock of the undersigned upon the nominees for directors; upon the other Items shown on the reverse side, which are described on the pages identified in the Table of Contents of the Proxy Statement; and upon all other matters which may come before the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of General Motors Company, or any adjournment thereof., 547694=Ms.\u00a0Barra was named Senior Vice President, Global Product Development in February 2011. Although her base salary remained unchanged from 2011 to 2012, her RSU grant and her SSU grant were increased in 2012 to bring her total compensation closer to median level., 548099=Mr.\u00a0Lee was named Vice President, Global Manufacturing\u00a0& President, International Operations in September 2012. He had been President, International Operations since December 2009. His compensation was increased in 2012 to bring his total compensation closer to median level and, recognizing the long-term vesting schedule for the RSU compensation, the mix of pay elements was adjusted to allocate a greater portion of his annual remuneration to SSUs in acknowledgement of the possibility of his retirement before the completion of the three-year vesting period for RSUs., 520554=Salary Stock Units. In addition to base salary, the Special Master prescribed the amount of SSUs. Pursuant to the Special Master\u0092s directives, during 2012 SSUs were granted to NEOs as part of their total annual compensation under the provisions of the General Motors Company Salary Stock Plan (the \u0093SSP\u0094). SSUs are determined as a dollar amount through the date they are earned, accrued at the same time as salary would otherwise be paid, and vested immediately upon accrual, with the number of SSUs granted based on the average of the high and low trading prices of our Common Stock on the date of each quarterly grant. Each grant is delivered in three annual installments, and the value of each installment depends upon the price of our Common Stock at the time of delivery. Compensation structures utilized by our comparator companies consist of both annual and long-term incentives based on achievement of significant business measures over varying time horizons. Annual and long-term performance-based awards with specific performance targets are key components in competitive pay structures at comparator companies. However, these types of awards are not permitted for our NEOs under the UST regulations. Our determination of the amount of SSUs which are a part of each NEO\u0092s structure were based on a combination of UST regulations and individual circumstances rather than competitive benchmarking, as there is no competitive benchmarking for salary stock. SSUs are not an effective form of compensation from a pay-for-performance perspective as the size of the award cannot vary with the performance of the company or the NEO. SSUs are also of limited value as a retention vehicle, since they are immediately vested upon accrual and paid in cash over a three year period., 138540=Theodore M. Solso has been a member of our Board of Directors since June 2012. Mr.\u00a0Solso served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cummins, Inc. (\u0093Cummins\u0094), a global company that manufactures diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, from 2000 until his retirement in December 2011. He is a director of Ball Corporation, a manufacturer of metal packing products and aerospace systems and technologies. Mr.\u00a0Solso also served as a director of Ashland Inc. (1999 to 2012)., 530226=2012 Summary Compensation Table, 410694=On December\u00a021, 2012, GM repurchased 200\u00a0million shares of our Common Stock from the UST, a Significant Stockholder, at a cash price of $27.50 per share for a total consideration of $5.5 billion (\u0093the Sale\u0094). The price paid in the Sale represented a 7.9 percent premium over the closing price of our Common Stock on December\u00a018, 2012, the day before the Sale was announced. In connection with the Sale, the UST publicly announced its intention to sell the remainder of its holdings of our Common Stock within 12 to 15 months after the Sale, subject to market conditions. GM incurred a special charge of approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of the Sale. The transaction was approved pursuant to the Company\u0092s Related Party Transactions Policy., 522479=Restricted Stock Units and Performance Metric. As described above, compliance with UST regulations means that our NEOs are not allowed to participate in typical types of incentive plans, and we may grant only a limited number of RSUs. Under such limitations, while consistent with rules and determinations promulgated by the UST, the RSU awards are not supportive of our pay-for-performance philosophy. RSUs were awarded to NEOs on March\u00a015, 2012 under the General Motors Company 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \u0093LTIP\u0094). The awards were granted in recognition of the achievement of 2011 Adjusted FCF performance and individual performance metrics., 684680=2012 Grants of Plan Based Awards, 94472=A list of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the annual meeting will be available for examination for a purpose that is germane to the meeting at General Motors Global Headquarters, 300 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan, 48243, for ten business days before the annual meeting between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, and also during the annual meeting., 133449=Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As Chief Executive Officer of Phillips and later ConocoPhillips, Mr.\u00a0Mulva oversaw mergers and acquisitions, business restructurings, and negotiated joint ventures, positioning the company to compete in an increasingly challenging and highly competitive industry. Prior to his retirement from ConocoPhillips in May 2012, Mr.\u00a0Mulva oversaw the strategic repositioning of the company to split its fuel production and refining businesses. Mr.\u00a0Mulva\u0092s expertise in the energy industry will provide valuable insight to our Board in developing GM\u0092s long-term energy diversity strategy, as will his in-depth background in finance. Mr.\u00a0Mulva also brings to our Board his experience in serving as a director of other large, complex companies., 1029892=2011, 549523=UST regulations impose additional limitations that exclude certain benefit practices that market-based surveys indicate are competitive. We did not make accruals in 2012 for non-qualified executive retirement restoration and deferred compensation plans for our NEOs as described in footnote\u00a06(ii) of the \u00932012 Summary Compensation Table\u0094 on page 45. In addition, severance payments to which a NEO becomes entitled in the future may not take into account any salary increase or grant of SSUs during 2012; and no NEO may receive a severance payment of any kind for termination of employment under the UST rules. These benefit plan restrictions, taken together with the restrictions on payment of cash compensation and appropriate incentives, have created an increasingly non-competitive structure., 523688=An Adjusted FCF target of $1.5 billion was set for these purposes in early 2011. Actual Adjusted FCF for 2011 was $3.0 billion, computed by cash flows generated from operating activities less capital expenditures and adjusted for the termination of an in-transit wholesale advance agreement in GMNA resulting in an increase to accounts receivable of $1.1 billion and OPEB payments of $0.8 billion relating to the health care trust settlement (as described in our discussion titled \u0093Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\u0094 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February\u00a015, 2013). Consistent with the UST regulations and award maximums, the RSU grants were made at the target level to the NEOs on March\u00a015, 2012., 579491=2012 Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation (Say-On-Pay), 57279=Holders of our Common Stock as of the close of business on April\u00a08, 2013 are entitled to vote at the annual meeting. On that date, the Company had 1,374,615,979 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of our Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote., 122923=E. Neville Isdell has been a member of our Board of Directors since July\u00a02009. He was also a member of the Board of General Motors Corporation from 2008 to 2009. Mr.\u00a0Isdell served as Chairman of The Coca-Cola Company from 2004 to 2009 and Chief Executive Officer from 2004 to 2008. From 2002 to 2004, he was an International Consultant to The Coca-Cola Company and headed his investment company, Collines Investments. Mr.\u00a0Isdell served as Chief Executive Officer of Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company from 2000 to May 2001 and Vice Chairman from May 2001 to December 2001. He was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coca-Cola Beverages plc from 1998 to September 2000. Mr.\u00a0Isdell also served as a director of SunTrust Banks, Inc. (2004 to 2008)., 874495=The awards are valued in this column based on the closing price of our Common Stock on December\u00a031, 2012 ($28.83)., 559604=The Compensation Committee annually reviews the performance and independence of CAP and the consultant and CAP\u0092s policy on consultant independence. During the most recent review, which occurred in October 2012, the Compensation Committee found that the work of the consultant posed no areas of concern or any conflict of interest. In reaching such determination, the Company considered the following factors, all of which were attested to or affirmed by CAP:, 428849=Individual Recommendations. The following changes were made to the NEOs\u0092 compensation to recognize their contributions in returning the business to profitability and motivating the leadership team to achieve key business initiatives. Additional information regarding these compensation decisions is provided in \u00932012 Compensation for Named Executive Officers\u0094 on page 38. No adjustments were made to base salaries for NEOs., 49271=In addition to this proxy statement and the proxy card or voting instruction form, the GM 2012 Annual Report to stockholders (\u0093Annual Report\u0094) is provided in this package and is available through the Internet., 98281=GM has received notice pursuant to Section\u00a01.11 of our Bylaws that a stockholder, who owns two shares of our Common Stock, intends to nominate candidates for election to the Board at the 2013 annual meeting. Under Section\u00a02.2(d) of our Bylaws, the Board has determined in its reasonable judgment that this is not considered a contested election. The Board recommends that you vote your shares for the candidates nominated by the Board.}",
