            "It seems that the lighting at night is pretty sparse and when you have a night class, you want to try to park as close as possible; however, you WILL have a distance to walk more than likely. It was nice to know that after 5pm, you are allowed to park in the faculty parking. That was always a help.",
            "Be sure to ask about any extra work that may be needed to be initiated into something! This was something I wish I had done--assuming there was just the fee to pay and the induction. This is not always the case, plus there are also some groups that require yearly dues to be paid. Look at all of it!",
            "Go to the financial aid office and ask them to review your case even after the financial awards have gone through! Sometimes something may have slipped through the cracks. Yes, I do think that you get what you pay for here. I have made many friends and also have a list of those to use as references (professors, teachers, etc.). Get your money's worth and do the same!",
            "For fun?! I have learned to make study groups fun. My core group gets together at least once a week and we will either go out to eat or meet up at one of our houses. We have learned to mix pleasure with work and it also helps to strengthen our bond as friends.",
            "I typically never eat on campus, but they do have a small variety of fast food areas to choose from--I love the Chick-fil-a area because it is very student friendly and inviting, yet off to the side so if you need to go there to study that's an option.",
            "Luckily, I was not a dorm student this time around...",
            "On the academic side of things, I have learned to always put my class schedule at the forefront of each notebook and follow it rigorously. I have also learned to make the teachers know my name--if you stand out to them and have a problem and need to send them an email, they can put a face to a name. Always keep good communication with the prof and things should go well.",
            "Build a core group around you that you know have your back when you need it--and you have theirs when they need you. Pop in and just say hi or bring a snack to the faculty that you know you will need to utilize often--they get to know you and will give you their very best even on a bad day.",
            "I have very much enjoyed the last year (more so than previous year) at UT--meeting great friends that will stick, learning from professors that care, building a collection for the future as far as my career. Although, at times, I feel that some of the profs/faculty are there for just the dollar, overall, I have found a core group that have helped to pull me through! I am grateful for this experience!"

They break the material down so that it is easier for the students to understand and SI sessions help a lot as well.

Am enjoying being here The campus itself is beautiful, especially in the late summer months and early fall. The campus housing is close to wherever you need to go, and is quite convenient.
