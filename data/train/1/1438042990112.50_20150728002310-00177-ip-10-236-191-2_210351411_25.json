I was in the student section near mid court for that Wake game. After Julius got up off the floor and started walking back to the State bench, he turned to Chris Paul, pointed at him, and said, \"I will fuck you up.\" Never gonna forget that. college hoops closer over at Deadspin reminisces about the Hodge/Paul incident and lists some of his best quotations.

They made a dramatic change to their approach that you don't see very often, upping their pace from 66 possessions per game a year ago to nearly 75 this season. While their offensive rebounding is down thanks to a lack of height and an increased reliance on three-pointers, they've made that irrelevant by shooting and protecting the basketball extremely well.  eFG% TO% 2007 52.5 22.7 2008 55.7 18.4 Starters: Greg Paulus (6-1, 185) -- As Ken Pomeroy noted, Paulus has become a smaller part of the offense this season; he's taking a little over 16% of Duke's shots while he's on the court, down from 20.3% a year ago. He's also become more of a three-point specialist, devoting about 69% of his attempts to threes. To his credit, he has decreased his turnover rate to the point where he can no longer be considered a liability here, though how much of that is just a function of his decreased role I do not know (the assist rate is down, too). Paulus is one of four Blue Devils who shoot threes regularly and hit over 40% of them. DeMarcus Nelson (6-4, 200) -- Shooting 42.3% from",
