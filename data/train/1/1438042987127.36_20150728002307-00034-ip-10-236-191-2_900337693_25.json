            "Security guards are always present on campus. for being a pretty small school, we usually have about 3 guards keeping an eye on things both inside and outside the school. if you are having a problem with another student, they will continuously walk by your class room to peak in and make sure everything is going ok and walk you out to your car if you dont feel safe.",

            "Very helpful with financial aid. Known as the cheapest college in the state of Indiana. You can receive the same diploma you would receive somewhere else, and receive it for much less money here.",
            "Most of the teachers are great people who understand the reason why we are attending school. They tend to try their best to make sure that the students are learning what needs to be learned but they also try to make the learning experiment as fun as possible.",
            "The downstairs lounge is usually very quiet. Contains a microwave and some vending machines. However, that's about all you will find here.",
            "No dorms.",
            "This campus is very helpful with trying to make sure that you succeed. However, at times it may be difficult to get a hold of your student adviser.",
            "Ivy Tech is known to be the cheapest school to attend in Indiana. Its a great place to simply just do what you need to do to get your degree. The teachers and staff are all very helpful on helping you to succeed.",
            "I attend Ivy Tech in Michigan City. This campus is in a very convenient location. Pricing is reasonable."

Greek Life None. Clubs and Activities There is a variety of clubs located at the school. Great for these types of students Automotive Tech, Carpentry, Mortuary Science, and welding.
