Cost of service and other revenues increased 30.2% to $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 from $1.7 million in the same period in 2003. Cost of service and other revenues increased 22.8% to $4.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 from $3.4 million in the same period in 2003.\u00a0 For the three months ended June 30, 2004, gross margin on service and other revenues was $3.6\u00a0million, or 62.5% of service and other revenues as compared to $3.0\u00a0million, or 64.3% of service and other revenues in the same period in 2003. The decrease in gross margin on services and other revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2004 was a result of increased costs as a result of a change to the service call center model which provides extended hours of coverage to customers. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, gross margin on service and other revenues was $7.2\u00a0million, or 63.2% of service and other revenues as compared to $5.8\u00a0million, or 62.8% of service and other revenues in the same period in 2003.\u00a0 The increase in gross margin on service and other revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2004 reflect a reduction in cost from the transition from an outsourced model to an internal service organization, partially offset by increased costs due to the change to the service call center model\u00a0 which provides extended hours of coverage to customers. We expect the cost of services and other revenues will continue to fluctuate based on our ability to improve cost efficiencies from our internal service organization., 653068=Provisions for income taxes were recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. These provisions were attributable to federal and state alternative minimum taxes and other state taxes.\u00a0 The amounts provided were at rates less than the combined U.S. federal and state statutory rates due to the recognition of federal and state net operating loss carryfowards., 94015=2004, 435577=2007, 662616=We have net operating lease commitments of $6.8 million payable when due through 2009 as follows (in thousands):, 316358=The Company reports segments in accordance with SFAS No. 131, \u0093Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.\u0094 SFAS 131 requires the use of a management approach in identifying segments of an enterprise. The Company has two operating segments: the medication and supply dispensing systems and the e-commerce business. The Company\u0092s chief operating decision-maker reviews information pertaining to reportable segments to the operating income level. There are no significant inter-segment sales or transfers. Assets of the operating segments are not segregated and substantially all of the Company\u0092s long-lived assets are located in the United States.\u00a0 For the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, substantially all of the Company\u0092s total revenues and gross profits were generated by the medication and supply dispensing systems operating segment. The Web-based e-commerce business operating segment generated less than one and a half percent (1.5%) of consolidated revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. The Web-based e-commerce segment generated operating income of approximately $0.1\u00a0million for the three months ended June 30, 2004, compared to incurring an operating loss of approximately $0.1\u00a0million for the three months ended June 30, 2003.\u00a0\u00a0 The Web-based e-commerce segment broke even for the six months ended June 30, 2004, compared to incurring an operating loss of approximately $0.2\u00a0million for the six months ended June 30, 2003., 800809=Certifications required by Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. \u00a71350)., 658801=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We used $11.4 million of cash in investing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2004 compared to $2.5\u00a0million used in the same period in 2003.\u00a0 The increase in cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2004 compared to June 30, 2003 resulted from net $7.2 million purchases of short-term investments, the payment of $0.6 million for the acquisition of the SecureVault product line from Ariel Distributing, the payment of $0.7 million for a product development agreement with Integra Group, Inc., $1.0 million paid as part of the BCX acquisition, including $0.5 million paid as part of the purchase price and $0.5 million paid relating to the achievement of performance milestones in 2003. Additionally, capital expenditures were $1.9 million and $0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 respectively., 673965=Factors That May Affect Future Operating Results, 273062=Development costs related to software implemented in the Company\u0092s medication and supply dispensing systems and incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the related products ranging from 3 to 5 years. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model, which is a matter of judgment using the guidelines of SFAS No. 86, \u0093Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.\u0094 All such development costs incurred prior to the completion of a working model are recognized as research and development expense. As of June 30, 2004 and December\u00a031, 2003, the balance of capitalized software development costs was approximately $1.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively. These costs are reported as a component of other assets. Amortization of capitalized software development costs was $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amortization of capitalized software development costs for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 was $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively., 4370=For the quarterly period ended June 30, 2004, 790274=Date: August 9, 2004, 569819=Year over year comparison for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 (in thousands):, 253306=The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared by management, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States pursuant to instructions to Form\u00a010-Q and Article\u00a010 of Regulation\u00a0S-X related to interim financial information.\u00a0 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u0092s rules and regulations. The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, APRS, Inc., Omnicell HealthCare Canada,\u00a0Inc., and BCX Technology, Inc.\u00a0 All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which would include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position as of June 30, 2004 and the results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented have been made. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December\u00a031, 2003 has been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date., 431416=Estimated future amortization expense of the purchased intangible assets at June 30, 2004 is as follows (in thousands):, 639274=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Restructuring and Severance charges.\u00a0 In fiscal 2004 and 2003, we restructured our organization to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies.\u00a0 As part of this restructuring, we reduced headcount by 3 employees in 2004 and by 14 employees in 2003.\u00a0\u00a0 As a result, we recorded restructuring and severance charges of $0.2 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2003, primarily related to employee severance and benefits., 12375=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicate by check mark whether the registrant (1)\u00a0has filed all reports required to be filed by Section\u00a013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12\u00a0months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2)\u00a0has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90\u00a0days.\u00a0Yes\u00a0\u00fd\u00a0No\u00a0o, 760340=Our Annual Meeting of Stockholders was held on May\u00a020, 2004. Proxies for the meeting were solicited pursuant to Regulation\u00a014A. At the meeting, management\u0092s nominees for three new Class III directors to serve until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2007 were submitted to our stockholders for election, and a proposal to ratify the selection of Ernst\u00a0& Young LLP as independent auditors of Omnicell for the fiscal year ending December\u00a031, 2004 was submitted to our stockholders for election., 715224=U.S. government customers sign five-year non-cancelable payment terms but are subject to one-year government budget funding cycles. In our judgment and based on our history with these accounts, we believe these receivables are collectible. However, in the future, the failure of any of our U.S. government customers to receive their annual funding could impair our ability to sell to these customers or to sell our U.S. government receivables to third-party leasing companies.\u00a0 In addition, the ability to collect payments on unsold receivables could be impaired and may result in a write down of our unsold receivables to U.S. government customers. As of June 30, 2004 the balance of our unsold leases to U.S. government customers was $3.4 million., 756517=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On June 30, 2004, ePlus Government Inc., a leasing company, which has purchased some of the Company\u0092s receivables with recourse, filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Commonwealth of Virginia, seeking payment of approximately $1.7 million in connection with a customer\u0092s failure to pay ePlus amounts owed under a\u00a0contract with such customer\u00a0that have been\u00a0 assigned to ePlus. The Company recorded the transaction as receivable subject to a sales agreement in compliance with SFAS 140 requirements as discussed in \u0093Sales of Accounts Receivable\u0094 under Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements., 743606=confidentiality of health information and to establish a schedule\u00a0for implementing national health data privacy legislation or regulations. In August\u00a02002, HHS published final modifications to its privacy regulations that took effect on April\u00a014, 2003. These regulations restrict the use and disclosure of personally identifiable health information by our customers who are \u0091\u0091covered entities\u0092\u0092 under HIPAA. Because Omnicell may be considered a \u0091\u0091business associate\u0092\u0092 under HIPAA, many of our customers have required that we enter into written agreements governing the way we handle any patient information we may encounter in providing our products and services. In February\u00a02003, HHS issued final security rules requiring covered entities to implement appropriate technical and physical safeguards of electronically transmitted personal health information by April\u00a02005. We cannot predict the potential impact of these rules, rules that have not yet been proposed or any other rules that might be finally adopted on our customers or on Omnicell. In addition, other federal and/or state privacy legislation may be enacted at any time. These laws and regulations could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information.\u00a0 This could reduce the demand for our products or force us to redesign our products in order to meet regulatory requirements., 3580=QUARTERLY REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 93000=Six Months Ended June 30,, 510478=Three Months Ended June 30,, 268955=Revenues from the Company\u0092s Web-based procurement application are recognized ratably over the subscription period. Web-based procurement application revenues were not significant (less than 1.5% of total revenues) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, and are included in product and service and other revenue., 509183=The following table sets forth certain items included in our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, expressed as a percentage of total revenues for these periods:, 94635=2003, 745764=In February\u00a02003, our Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that is beneficial to our stockholders. Pursuant to the terms of the plan, when a person or group, except under certain circumstances, acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock (other than two current stockholders and their affiliated entities, which will not trigger the rights plan unless they acquire beneficial ownership of 17.5% and 22.5% or more, respectively, of our outstanding common stock) or ten business days after commencement or announcement of a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, the rights (except those rights held by the person or group who has acquired or announced an offer to acquire 15% or more of our outstanding common stock) would generally become exercisable for shares of our common stock at a discount. Because the potential acquiror\u0092s rights would not become exercisable for our shares of common stock at a discount, the potential acquiror would suffer substantial dilution and may lose its ability to acquire us. In addition, the existence of the plan itself may deter a potential acquiror from acquiring us. As a result, either by operation of the plan or by its potential deterrent effect, a change in control of our company that our stockholders may consider in their best interests may not occur., 36775=June 30, 2004, 457334=In December 2003, the Company recorded facility costs of $0.4 million related to the move of its corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility to its current location in Mountain View, California.\u00a0 This move was initiated to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies.\u00a0 The facility costs consisted of remaining rent expense and the write-off of the remaining leasehold improvements related to the Company\u0092s former facilities in Palo Alto, California. The lease related to Omnicell\u0092s former manufacturing facility expired in February 2004.\u00a0 The lease related to Omnicell\u0092s former corporate headquarters expired in June 2004., 769089=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Section\u00a010A(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the \u0093Act\u0094), we are required to disclose the non-audit services approved by our Audit Committee to be performed by our external auditor. During the three months ended June 30, 2004.,our Audit Committee approved the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP to perform services related to tax matter consultations concerning foreign taxes and compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which constitute in part non-audit services within the meaning of Section 10A(i) of the Act., 440540=The Company offers customers multi-year, non-cancelable payment terms.\u00a0 For the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, sales of medication and supply dispensing systems sold with multi-year payment terms totaled approximately $9.6 million and $16.3 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2003, sales of medication and supply dispensing systems sold with multi-year payment terms totaled approximately $5.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively.\u00a0 The Company typically sells the customers\u0092 multi-year payment agreements to a third-party leasing company.\u00a0 For the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, customer multi-year payment term agreements sold to third-party leasing companies totaled approximately $9.5 million and $15.1\u00a0million, respectively.\u00a0 For the three and six months ended June 30, 2003, customer multi-year payment term agreements sold to third-party leasing companies totaled approximately $5.0 million and $14.8\u00a0million, respectively.\u00a0 The Company has no obligation under a multi-year payment agreement once it is sold to the finance company. Revenue is recognized upon completion of the Company\u0092s installation obligation, if any, and commencement of the noncancelable multi-year payment term. At June 30, 2004 and December\u00a031, 2003, accounts receivable included $4.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, from the finance companies for multi-year payment term agreements sold., 736051=We acquired two new products in the second half of 2002 and one new product in the third quarter of 2003, Omnicell PharmacyCentral, SafetyMed and ScanREQ, all of which we believe are competitive in their respective markets and will meet the demands of our customers for central pharmacy storage and retrieval, bedside automation and open supply management. Our current business goals are dependent in part on customer acceptance of these new products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful, 458277=The following table sets forth the facility costs reserve activity for the first and second quarter of 2004 (in thousands):, 262405=Purchased intangible assets with finite lives include acquired developed software technology, service contracts, customer relationships and backlog acquired in a business combination. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of three to six years. Additionally, purchased intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. No impairment of purchased intangible assets with finite lives was recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003., 663348=2004, 387002=On December\u00a06, 2002, Omnicell purchased substantially all of the intellectual property assets of Medisafe, a provider of point-of-care patient safety solutions. As part of the transaction, Omnicell acquired technology for a new bedside medication management solution called SafetyMed. This solution automates the nursing workflow process associated with medication administration and uses bar code technology to help ensure patient safety. The total purchase price was $3.0 million, which included $1.5 million paid at the date of purchase, $1.0 million paid in June\u00a02003 after completion of certain obligations by Medisafe, and $0.5 million in guaranteed minimum royalties due in equal annual installments of $0.1 million beginning in January\u00a02005. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $20,000 of acquisition related costs.\u00a0 The Company allocated the purchase price to the acquired intangible assets and purchased in-process research and development based on the income approach to valuation.\u00a0 Under the income approach, the Company assumed a cash flow period of five years, revenue growth rates of 33% to 210% on an annual basis and discount rates of 25% to 35%.\u00a0 The purchase price allocation was as follows (in thousands):, 788216=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed in its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized., 370906=On March 31, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued its Exposure Draft, \u0093Share-Based Payment\u0094 (the \u0093Exposure Draft\u0094) which is a proposed amendment to FASB Statement No. 123, \u0093Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.\u0094 Generally, the approach in the Exposure Draft is similar to the approach described in FASB Statement 123. \u00a0However, the Exposure Draft would require all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. The FASB expects to issue a final standard late in 2004 that would be effective for the Company\u0092s 2005 fiscal year. \u00a0The pro forma impact of the adoption of FASB Statement 123 on our historical financial statements is included in the footnotes to the financial statements. The Company expects to continue to grant stock options to employees and the impact of the adoption of the new standard, when and if issued, is likely to have a material impact on its future results of operations., 254880=The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company\u0092s December\u00a031, 2003 audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company\u0092s Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Net income was $4.7 million during the first six months of 2004 compared to $1.7 million in the same period in 2003.\u00a0 The decrease in cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from the reduction in accrued liabilities, increased inventories, accounts payable, deferred services and other assets which included an increase of $1.8 million for internally-billed receivables with multi-year sales agreements.\u00a0 Inventories increased by $4.2 million for the period ended June 30, 2004 as a result of inventory build up for expected customer orders that were not shipped during the period.\u00a0 We expect that most of the orders will be shipped during the third and fourth quarters of 2004., 511043=Six Months Ended June 30,, 673042=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There were no significant changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures in market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices from the Company\u0092s Form\u00a010-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ended December\u00a031, 2003., 92465=June 30,, 434515=2006, 785915=(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On April 5, 2004, we filed a current report on Form 8-K relating to the issuance of a press release announcing Omnicell\u0092s financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2004., 460959=Balance at December 31, 2003, 444427=December 31, 2003, 660176=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We generated $4.9 million from financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2004 compared to $1.6 million generated in the first six months of 2003.

Cost of product revenues increased 12.2% to $18.5\u00a0million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 from $16.5\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. The increase in cost of product revenues was attributable to the increase in headcount and temporary labor.\u00a0 Gross profit on product revenue was $14.0\u00a0million, or 60.1% of product revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2004, as compared to $11.6\u00a0million, or 56.9% of product revenues in the same period in 2003. Gross profit on product revenue was $27.0\u00a0million, or 59.4% of product revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2004, as compared to $21.5\u00a0million, or 56.5% of product revenues in the same period in 2003. The increase in the gross profit on product revenues is a result of increased efficiencies in operations, manufacturing and installation services. We expect the cost of product revenues to increase consistently with product revenue growth, maintaining approximately the same level of gross profit margin throughout the rest of 2004., 655673=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our principal sources of liquidity, which include cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, totaled approximately $36.3 million as of June 30, 2004 compared to $36.2 million as of March 31, 2004 and $33.5 million as of December\u00a031, 2003.

Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of shares and, if dilutive, common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents include the effect of outstanding dilutive stock options and warrants, computed using the treasury stock method. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, options to purchase 416,654 and 1,640,177 shares, respectively, with an exercise price greater than $16.84 and $6.72, the average fair market value per share for the period, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share as their affect was antidilutive., 612054=Service and Other Revenues. Service and other revenues include revenues from service and maintenance contracts, rentals of automation systems, and amortization of up-front fees received from distributors.\u00a0 Service and other revenues increased 24.1% to $5.8\u00a0million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 from $4.7\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. Service and other revenues increased 24.1% to $11.4\u00a0million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 from $9.2\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. The increase in service and other revenues was primarily due to the increase in our installed base of automation systems and an increase in support service contracts.\u00a0 We expect a slight increase in service and other revenues for the remainder of 2004., 5630=TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 637418=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Selling, General and Administrative.\u00a0 Selling, general and administrative costs increased 25.3% to $13.2\u00a0million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 from $10.6\u00a0million in the same period in 2003.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is a result of increased headcount to support the targeted increases in revenue and bookings and continued business growth. We increased headcount in our selling, general and administrative areas by approximately 29% from June 30, 2003 to June 30 2004, with half of the growth concentrated in direct sales support and field operations.\u00a0 Marketing costs also increased in 2004 as a result of an increase in product advertising.\u00a0 Selling, general and administrative costs increased as a percentage of total revenues to 48.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2004 compared to 41.9% in the same period in 2003.

Our automation solutions often involve a significant financial commitment by our customers, and, as a result, our ability to grow our business is largely dependent on our customers\u0092 information technology budgets.
