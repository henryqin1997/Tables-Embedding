None has so painstakingly chiselled his way to greatness TCM August issue, 51685=When both Shane Warne and Shaun Udal left Hampshire in 2007, Dawson gained his chance but it was as a batsmen he most impressed and he scored a maiden first-class century at Trent Bridge in September 2008 - the youngest player to score a hundred for the county - and grew into an opening batsman, taking his chance when Michael Carberry was absent from the 2011 season, scoring two centuries. After a lean 2012 - a struggle for all batsman - Dawson put up over 1000 first-class runs in 2013. But a year later he regressed; disappointing in 10 matches of Hampshire's promotion-winning season and playing little part in T20 cricket., 51243=Liam Dawson is a former England Under-19s captain who recorded the best figures for the side with 6 for 9 against Malaysia in 2007. He has since steadily developed into a top order batsman who bowls some useful left-arm spin. He has grown into an integral part of Hampshire's side in all formats and is contracted until the end of 2017., 34391=Born March 1, 1990, Swindon, Wiltshire, 58792=NBC Denis Compton Award 2008, 55899=Apr 21, 2015, 58731=NBC Denis Compton Award 2007, 52358=His bowling has come along nicely. He took 7 for 51 on debut for Moutaineers in Zimbabwe before the 2012 season and that summer hit the headlines by dismissing Kevin Pietersen for two golden ducks in a 40-over and T20 match. He found himself a role opening the bowling in T20, taking nine wickets at 24.22 as Hampshire won the T20 competition and a year later, 13 at 21.30 as they reached finals day for the fourth consecutive year.
