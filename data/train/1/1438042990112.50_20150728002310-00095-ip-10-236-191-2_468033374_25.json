For example, buffering communications data, creating large volatile tables and arrays. One interesting application is voice storage and playback. Some applications require relatively Using External RAM with PIC17CXX Devices This Technical Brief shows how to connect a PIC17CXX device to external memory. It also provides instructions and calculations to help determine which speeds of SRAM work with which frequency crystal.
