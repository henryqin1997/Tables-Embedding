Preferably, UV-radiation is employed up to the intensity of 100 J/cm2. The irradiation source can be any UV-light generator operating in a range of about 50 watts to about 25000 watts with a power output capable of supplying the desired dosage. The wattage can be adjusted to appropriate levels which may be, for example, 1000 watts or 4800 watts or 6000 watts or higher or lower. Many other apparati for UV-irradiating polymeric materials are known in the art. The irradiation is usually carried out at a dosage between about 3 J/cm2 to about 500 J/scm2, preferably between about 5 J/cm2 to about 100 J/cm2. Further, the irradiation can be carried out conveniently at room temperature, although higher and lower temperatures, for example 0\ufffd C. to about 60\ufffd C., may also be employed. The photocrosslinking process is faster at higher temperatures. Preferably, the irradiation is carried out after shaping or fabrication of the article. In a preferred embodiment, the copolymer which has been incorporated with a photoadditive is irradiated with UV-radiation at about 10 J/cm2 to about 50 J/cm2., 364837=Fabricated articles which can be made using the fibers and fabrics according to embodiments of the invention include elastic composite articles (e.g., diapers) that have elastic portions. For example, elastic portions are typically constructed into diaper waist band portions to prevent the diaper from falling and leg band portions to prevent leakage (as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,381,781, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). Often, the elastic portions promote better form fitting and/or fastening systems for a good combination of comfort and reliability. The inventive fibers and fabrics can also produce structures which combine elasticity with breathability. For example, the inventive fibers, fabrics and/or films may be incorporated into the structures disclosed in U.S. provisional patent application 60/083,784, filed May 1, 1998. Laminates of non-wovens comprising fibers of the invention can also be formed and can be used in various articles, including consumer goods, such as durables and disposable consumers goods, like apparel, diapers, hospital gowns, hygiene applications, upholstery fabrics, etc., 392717=Antioxidants, e.g., Irgafos 168, Irganox 1010, Irganox 3790, and chimassorb 944 made by Ciba Geigy Corp., may be added to the ethylene polymer to protect against undo degradation during shaping or fabrication operation and/or to better control the extent of grafting or crosslinking (i.e., inhibit excessive gelation). In-process additives, e.g. calcium stearate, water, fluoropolymers, etc., may also be used for purposes such as for the deactivation of residual catalyst and/or improved processability. Tinuvin 770 (from Ciba-Geigy) can be used as a light stabilizer., 44300=(a) having a Mw/Mn from about 1.7 to about 3.5, at least one melting point, Tm, in degrees Celsius, and a density, d, in grams/cubic centimeter, wherein the numerical values of Tm and d correspond to the relationship: T m>\u22122002.9+4538.5(d)\u22122422.2(d)2; or, 90497=The \u201ccomposition mode\u201d of the detector is equipped with a measurement sensor (CH2) and composition sensor (CH3) that are fixed narrow band infra-red filters in the region of 2800-3000 cm\u22121. The measurement sensor detects the methylene (CH2) carbons on the polymer (which directly relates to the polymer concentration in solution) while the composition sensor detects the methyl (CH3) groups of the polymer. The mathematical ratio of the composition signal (CH3) divided by the measurement signal (CH2) is sensitive to the comonomer content of the measured polymer in solution and its response is calibrated with known ethylene alpha-olefin copolymer standards., 384794=In addition to electron-beam irradiation, crosslinking can also be effected by UV irradiation. U.S. Pat. No. 6,709,742 discloses a cross-linking method by UV irradiation which can be used in embodiments of the invention. The method comprises mixing a photoinitiator, with or without a photocrosslinker, with a polymer before, during, or after a fiber is formed and then exposing the fiber with the photoinitiator to sufficient UV radiation to crosslink the polymer to the desired level. The photoinitiators used in the practice of the invention are aromatic ketones, e.g., benzophenones or monoacetals of 1,2-diketones. The primary photoreaction of the monacetals is the homolytic cleavage of the \u03b1-bond to give acyl and dialkoxyalkyl radicals. This type of \u03b1-cleavage is known as a Norrish Type I reaction which is more fully described in W. Horspool and D. Armesto, Organic Photochemistry: A Comprehensive Treatment, Ellis Horwood Limited, Chichester, England, 1992; J. Kopecky, Organic Photochemistry: A Visual Approach, VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, N.Y. 1992; N. J. Turro, et al., Acc. Chem. Res., 1972, 5, 92; and J. T. Banks, et al., J. Am. Chem.

Flexural and 2 percent secant moduli are measured according to ASTM D-790. Storage modulus is measured according to ASTM D 5026-01 or equivalent technique., 141195=Differential Scanning Calorimetry results are determined using a TAI model Q1000 DSC equipped with an RCS cooling accessory and an autosampler. A nitrogen purge gas flow of 50 ml/min is used. The sample is pressed into a thin film and melted in the press at about 175\ufffd C. and then air-cooled to room temperature (25\ufffd C.). 3-10 mg of material is then cut into a 6 mm diameter disk, accurately weighed, placed in a light aluminum pan (ca 50 mg), and then crimped shut. The thermal behavior of the sample is investigated with the following temperature profile. The sample is rapidly heated to 180\ufffd C. and held isothermal for 3 minutes in order to remove any previous thermal history. The sample is then cooled to \u221240\ufffd C. at 10\ufffd C./min cooling rate and held at \u221240\ufffd C. for 3 minutes. The sample is then heated to 150\ufffd C. at 10\ufffd C./min. heating rate. The cooling and second heating curves are recorded., 154438=Melt index, or I2, is measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190\ufffd C./2.16 kg. Melt index, or I10 is also measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190\ufffd C./10 kg., 135020=In some embodiments, the inventive interpolymers made with two catalysts incorporating differing quantities of comonomer have a weight ratio of blocks formed thereby from 95:5 to 5:95. The elastomeric polymers desirably have an ethylene content of from 20 to 90 percent, a diene content of from 0.1 to 10 percent, and an \u03b1-olefin content of from 10 to 80 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer.

Conversely, the hard segments can be present in similar ranges. The soft segment weight percentage and the hard segment weight percentage can be calculated based on data obtained from DSC or NMR. Such methods and calculations are disclosed in a concurrently filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/376,835 (insert when known), entitled \u201cEthylene/\u03b1-Olefin Block Interpolymers\u201d, filed on Mar. 15, 2006, in the name of Colin L. P. Shan, Lonnie Hazlitt, et. al. and assigned to Dow Global Technologies Inc., the disclose of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 140492=The CRYSTAF peak temperature and area are identified by the peak analysis module included in the CRYSTAF Software (Version 2001.b, PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain). The CRYSTAF peak finding routine identifies a peak temperature as a maximum in the dW/dT curve and the area between the largest positive inflections on either side of the identified peak in the derivative curve. To calculate the CRYSTAF curve, the preferred processing parameters are with a temperature limit of 70\ufffd C. and with smoothing parameters above the temperature limit of 0.1, and below the temperature limit of 0.3., 146548=Stress-strain behavior in uniaxial tension is measured using ASTM D 1708 microtensile specimens. Samples are stretched with an Instron at 500% min\u22121 at 21\ufffd C. Tensile strength and elongation at break are reported from an average of 5 specimens., 413298=The tensile behaviors of fibers spun from Ex. 19A, Ex. 19B, and Ex. 19K. are measured based on BISFA Test Methods for Bare Elastic Yams, Chapter 6: Tensile Properties Option A. F Fibers are tested at 500 mm/min with 100 mm gauge length. Pneumatic clamps are used (Model 2712-001, Instron Corp.). Tenacity, elongation at break, and load at 300% elongation are reported from an average of 5 replicates., 411786=Monofilament fibers of 40 denier are melt spun into 100 to 300 g bobbins using inventive Ex. 19A and Ex. 19B, and comparative Ex. 19K (Dow AFFINITY\ufffd EG8100) with a 2.7\ufffd0.9 mm round spinneret. With density and melt index similar to Ex. 19A and Ex. 19B, Ex. 19K is an ethylene-octene copolymer with 0.870 g/cc density as determined by ASTM D-792 and 1 MI as determined according to ASTM D-1238, Condition 190\ufffd C./2.16 kg. Spinning temperatures range from 280\ufffd C. to 290\ufffd C. for Ex. 19A and Ex. 19B. Ex. 19K is spun at 290\ufffd C. and 300\ufffd C. only due to excessive fiber breakage when spun at a lower temperature. Between the spinneret and the takeup roller, there is a cold air quench chamber with 2 m in length for solidifying the fiber. A silicone based spin finish of Lurol 8517 (Goulston Technologies) is applied at 2 wt % to the surface of the fiber via a spin finish applicator after the fiber had solidified from the melt. Afterwards, the fiber is wound into a bobbin with speeds ranged from 400 to 600 m/min. The spinning temperature and winding speeds are processing variables used to tailor the tensile response of the resulting fiber. Prior to spinning, resins from each of the examples are compounded with 3000 ppm of Cyanox 1790 (Cytec Industries) and 3000 ppm of Chimasorb 944 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals) as antioxidants., 279127=Table 5 also shows that the polymers of the invention have better retractive stress at 150 percent strain (demonstrated by higher retractive stress values) than some of the comparative samples. Comparative Examples F, G and H have retractive stress value at 150 percent strain of 400 kPa or less, while the inventive polymers have retractive stress values at 150 percent strain of 500 kPa (Ex. 11) to as high as about 1100 kPa (Ex. 17). Polymers having higher than 150 percent retractive stress values would be quite useful for elastic applications, such as elastic fibers and fabrics, especially nonwoven fabrics. Other applications include diaper, hygiene, and medical garment waistband applications, such as tabs and elastic bands., 144991=Samples for density measurement are prepared according to ASTM D 1928. Measurements are made within one hour of sample pressing using ASTM D792, Method B., 450037=\u201cStickpoint\u201d is defined as the point in the spinline at which the fiber is solid enough not to stick to an object. Stick points are usually measured by stringing up the fiber at fixed speeds (e.g., 1000, 2000, 3000 m/min), and then pressing a glass rod against the front of the fiber bundle at the bottom of the quench cabinet. The glass rod is slowly raised until the fiber sticks to the rod. The distance from the spinneret to the point in the cabinet where the glass rod stuck to the fibers is recorded as the stickpoint. This measurement is repeated 3 times at each spinning speed and the stick points are averaged. When measuring the stick point or collecting the monocomponent elastic fibers, only the A-side extruder was used for extruding fibers, 394151=To reduced the friction coefficient of the fibers, various spin finish formulations can be used, such as metallic soaps dispersed in textile oils (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,039,895 or 6,652,599), surfactants in a base oil (see for example US publication 2003/0024052) and polyalkylsiolxanes (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,296,063 or 4,999,120).

No. 10/933,721 (published as US20050142360) discloses spin finish compositions that can also be used., 46348=(e) having a storage modulus at 25\ufffd C., G\u2032(25\ufffd C.), and a storage modulus at 100\ufffd C., G\u2032(100\ufffd C.), wherein the ratio of G\u2032(25\ufffd C.) to G\u2032(100\ufffd C.) is from about 1:1 to about 10:1;, 110868=Catalyst (A2) is [N-(2,6-di(1-methylethyl)phenyl)amido)(2-methylphenyl)(1,2-phenylene-(6-pyridin-2-diyl)methane)]hafnium dimethyl, prepared according to the teachings of WO 03/40195, 2003US0204017, U.S. Ser. No. 10/429,024, filed May 2, 2003, and WO 04/24740., 138685=A Symyx Rapid GPC system is used to determine the molecular weight data for each sample. A Gilson 350 pump set at 2.0 ml/min flow rate is used to pump helium-purged 1,2-dichlorobenzene stabilized with 300 ppm Ionol as the mobile phase through three Plgel 10 micrometer (\u03bcm) Mixed B 300 mm\ufffd7.5 mm columns placed in series and heated to 160\ufffd C. A Polymer Labs ELS 1000 Detector is used with the Evaporator set to 250\ufffd C., the Nebulizer set to 165\ufffd C., and the nitrogen flow rate set to 1.8 SLM at a pressure of 60-80 psi (400\u2212600 kPa) N2. The polymer samples are heated to 160\ufffd C. and each sample injected into a 250 \u03bcl loop using the liquid-handling robot and a heated needle. Serial analysis of the polymer samples using two switched loops and overlapping injections are used. The sample data is collected and analyzed using Symyx Epoch\u2122 software. Peaks are manually integrated and the molecular weight information reported uncorrected against a polystyrene standard calibration curve., 157706=Approximately 2000 ml portions of eluant from the preparative TREF column are collected in a 16 station, heated fraction collector. The polymer is concentrated in each fraction using a rotary evaporator until about 50 to 100 ml of the polymer solution remains. The concentrated solutions are allowed to stand overnight before adding excess methanol, filtering, and rinsing (approx. 300-500 ml of methanol including the final rinse). The filtration step is performed on a 3 position vacuum assisted filtering station using 5.0 \u03bcm polytetrafluoroethylene coated filter paper (available from Osmonics Inc., Cat# Z50WP04750). The filtrated fractions are dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60\ufffd C. and weighed on an analytical balance before further testing., 235084=Polymer samples are evaluated for physical properties such as high temperature resistance properties, as evidenced by TMA temperature testing, pellet blocking strength, high temperature recovery, high temperature compression set and storage modulus ratio, G\u2032(25\ufffd C.)/G\u2032(100\ufffd C.). Several commercially available polymers are included in the tests: Comparative G* is a substantially linear ethylene/1-octene copolymer (AFFINITY\ufffd, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative H* is an elastomeric, substantially linear ethylene/1-octene copolymer (AFFINITY\ufffdEG8100, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative I is a substantially linear ethylene/1-octene copolymer (AFFINITY\ufffdPL1840, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative J is a hydrogenated styrene/butadiene/styrene triblock copolymer (Kraton\u2122 G1652, available from KRATON Polymers), Comparative K is a thermoplastic vulanizate (TPV, a polyolefin blend containing dispersed therein a crosslinked elastomer).
