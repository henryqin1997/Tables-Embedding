            "24/7 service, always a phone call away. Always willing to help, campus security is top-notch.",
            "One sorority is Phi Mu, very service oriented. as well as Alpha Delta Gamma fraternity for men looking to help out in the community and have fun with friends while doing so.",
            "Always something for everyone, whether it be the Ultimate Frisbee Club, or SGA (student government association) there is something for everyone.",
            "Students looking for a small campus, but with big involvement on campus and in the community.",
            "On campus, the St. Ursuline statue brings good luck. On the night before big tests, students will put either flowers or money into her awaiting palms and these students do very well on the tests after.",
            "Bellarmine does a lot to give each undergraduate some form of scholarship or grant so that paying for college is easier. And through the Bursar's office, they always have someone willing to help find additional scholarships. Worth every penny.",
            "There is Cherokee Park within walking distance, and Joe Creason Park as well. the Louisville Zoo is also within walking distance, and so is Bardstown road. Everything is close enough that even with a drive, downtown is only 5 minutes away. So much to do, weather it be running a marathon, or night life on Bardstown, there is a great local area that has so much to offer.",
            "The Palio is close to the residence halls and has a more homey feel to it. The University Dining Hall, is big, and allows for everyone on campus to see each other while looking out onto the campus itself. A downside is the hours at when each are open. It varies, and you have to schedule around this sometimes.",
            "All of the residence halls on campus are beautiful. The only downside is registering for them in enough time to get into the hall you want.",
            "Not only is the coursework challenging, it is also interesting and able to be applied to other classes on campus. Working on an assignment for one class you can learn so much about how you study, and how gaining knowledge is fun.",
            "Take advantage of getting to know the professors here. Not only are they active in their field of work, but they truly care about giving you the best education possible. Study hard, and get involved in Knights Nation or another club on campus. Staying connected is key to success, not only here, but for life in general.",
            "The small, beautiful rolling hills the campus rests on is coupled by the wonderful professors that know students by name. Close to downtown, there is plenty opportunities to connect to the community and be welcomed by Louisville and all it has to offer. From wonderful sporting events, to fantastic medical and business programs, Bellarmine has the uniqueness of a small school with the character of Louisville to match."

The school is perfect for students who want the big city experience without an overwhelmingly large university, but is not ideal for those looking for a lot of diversity.

    "textAfterTable": "I am an Honors student at Bellarmine and even in the courses that are not specifically Honors, there is much to be learned. The professors are eager to help answer any questions you might have, especially because of the small student population! Sure, the gen. eds. can be a little bit tedious since they're not in your major per-say, but those are a standard collegiate institution so better to just forge through them.
