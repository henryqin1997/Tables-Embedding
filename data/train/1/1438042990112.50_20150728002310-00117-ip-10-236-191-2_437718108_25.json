            "Description",
            "Wellbore Collection System - A system, apparatus and method are useful for lifting reservoir fluid in a gas-producing wellbore through the application of a differential between pressure of the gas in the wellbore's gas-production conduit a lower end of which is disposed in reservoir fluid accumulated at a bottom of the wellbore and pressure of the wellbore annulus. The apparatus comprises a collection module disposed in the gas-producing wellbore for collecting by condensation reservoir fluid being lifted as vapor with produced gas in a gas-production conduit disposed in the wellbore, and one or more lift modules for applying the pressure differential to lift the reservoir fluid collected by condensation, and optionally reservoir fluid accumulated at the bottom of the wellbore, within the wellbore.",
            "SYSTEM, METHOD AND ASSEMBLY FOR WELLBORE MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS - Methods for performing a wellbore maintenance operation on a system of wellbores used for improved oil recovery are disclosed. A plurality of wellbores are drilled and perforated to receive production fluids from a reservoir. The wellbores are fluidly connected to a production well that is drilled to a depth below the perforations of the wellbores. The production fluids drain and collect in the production well for delivery to the surface. A pump can be used for delivering the production fluids from the production well. During repair and maintenance operations, a fluid is injected into the production well for safely removing the pump components. The fluid is counterbalanced by the pressures in the connected wellbores such that the fluid does not rise above the perforations in the connected wellbores."

Looney, Houston, TX US 06-27-2013 PREPARATION AND USE OF NANO-CATALYSTS FOR IN-SITU REACTION WITH KEROGEN - Disclosed herein are methods for extracting a kerogen-based product from subsurface shale formations. The methods utilize in-situ reaction of kerogen involving liquid phase chemistry at ambient temperatures at pressures for the subsurface shale formation. These methods rely on chemically modifying the shale-bound kerogen to render it mobile using metal particulate catalysts. In the methods disclosed herein a fluid comprising metal is provided to the subsurface shale formation comprising kerogen in an inorganic matrix. A reducing agent is provided to the subsurface shale formation. The kerogen is converted by contacting the kerogen with a metal particulate catalyst formed from the metal; and a mobile kerogen-based product is formed. At least a portion of the mobile kerogen-based product is recovered. The kerogen-derived product can be upgraded to provide commercial products. 20130161008 Published Description Patent application number Mark D. Looney, San Ramon, CA US 07-30-2009 COAXIAL CABLE ALIGNMENT ENHANCER FOR USE WITHIN COAXIAL CABLE ASSEMBLIES SO AS TO ENSURE THE PROPER COAXIAL DISPOSITION OF THE COAXIAL CABLE CONTACT MEMBERS OF COAXIAL CABLE ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS - A coaxial cable assembly comprises a coaxial cable alignment enhancer which has a plurality of axially oriented recesses defined within its outer peripheral surface portion for accommodating a plurality of electrical cables. A securing member is disposed around the alignment enhancer so as to in",

The present invention is also directed at systems for implementing at least some of the foregoing methods. Additionally, the present invention is also directed to methods of fracturing and/or rubblizing subsurface shale formations and to methods of chemically modifying kerogen in situ so as to render it mobile. 05-21-2009 20100032171 Supercritical Pentane as an Extractant for Oil Shale - The present invention is directed to methods of extracting a hydrocarbon-based product from subsurface (oil) shale formations, wherein such methods rely on the use of an extraction fluid comprising pentane for facilitating the production of a mobile hydrocarbon-based product when the pentane contacts hydrocarbons in subsurface shale. The contacting process, and the subsequent process of recovering the mobile hydrocarbon-based product, is further enhanced by the methods of fracturing and/or rubblizing portions of the shale formation, so as to enhance their fluid permeability. 02-11-2010 20100270038 Kerogen Extraction from Subterranean Oil Shale Resources - The present invention is directed to methods for extracting",
