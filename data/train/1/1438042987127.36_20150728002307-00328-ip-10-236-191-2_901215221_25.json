Just because you want to go to a university doesn't mean you going to get a better education. You can get the same education in the same field in a community college. Plus it wont coast you that much. Will enjoy being here Yes i would like to be here. Will learn a lot I can learn allot from this school it has allot of courses and classes that i am interested in.
