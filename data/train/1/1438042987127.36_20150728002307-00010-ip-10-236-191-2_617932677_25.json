    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{7739=The AMD A10-4600M is a mobile quad-core processor based on the Trinity architecture. Officially introduced in Q2 2012, it is the direct successor to the Llano A-series of APUs (Accelerated Processing Unit) and is currently the fastest mobile Trinity APU on the market. The processing unit is manufactured in 32nm SOI and integrates a 2.3 GHz CPU (up to 3.2 GHz w/ Turbo Core) with a relatively fast Radeon HD 7660G GPU alongside a dual-channel memory controller, video de- and encoders and a northbridge. The CPU cores are based on a reworked Bulldozer architecture, called Piledriver. Although marketed as a quad-core processor, the A10-4600M includes only two modules with four integer-cores and two floating-point cores total. As a result, the CPU is not a\u00a0true quad-core processor. When compared to previous Bulldozer cores, AMD has managed to improve upon the IPC (instructions per clock) performance of Trinity cores while allowing for higher clock frequencies. However, when compared to its Llano predecessor, the multithreaded performance of Trinity has only been slightly improved. The enhanced Turbo Core 3.0 feature functions well in speeding up single threaded performance, although it is still not on the same level as Intel\u2019s Turbo Boost equivalent. Regardless, AMD has managed to include other features as well, such as the AVX extension (including FMA) and support for AES encryption. In terms of raw general performance, the A10-4600M can perform anywhere from 0 to 25% faster than the Llano-based A8-3520M. Single-threaded workloads can especially benefit from the new architecture and the updated Turbo Core functionality. If compared to Intel, a Sandy Bridge Core i3-2310M is roughly on a similar level to the A10-4600M, but results can still differ greatly from benchmark to benchmark. Nonetheless, CPU performance from\u00a0the AMD processor should be sufficient for all daily workloads like Office, Internet browsing and even light video editing or gaming. The integrated DirectX 11-compatible Radeon HD 7660G offers all 384 shader cores of the Trinity chip and, thanks to Turbo Core, will operate anywhere between 497 to 686 MHz\u00a0depending on the current application demand. On average, the performance of the\u00a0HD 7660G GPU is comparable to a dedicated Radeon HD 6650M and is even noticeably\u00a0faster than the HD Graphics 4000 as found in Intel\u2019s Ivy Bridge. The power consumption of the A10-4600M APU is rated at 35 Watt TDP and is therefore comparable to mid-range dual-core Ivy Bridge processors. Consequently, the A10-4600M is best suited for 14-inch notebooks or larger.}",
