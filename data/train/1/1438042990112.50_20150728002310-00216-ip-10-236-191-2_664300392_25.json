In 1987 the Brundtland Report stated that: \"sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d. This definition, according the report, contained within it two key concepts, one was concerned with essential needs of the world's poor; the other with technological limitations. (...) If a strictly anthropocentric view of sustainability is \u201cmeaningless\u201d then what of an ecocentric perspective that sees humans as just one element in a shared universe? (...) If we accept the definition of sustainable development as caring for the needs of the world\u2019s poor as a priority, then we can\u2019t ask the poor, in the same breath, to ignore their own needs and accept that we care more about the survival of rainforests or threatened species than we care",
