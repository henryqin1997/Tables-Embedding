The aspect ratio of the particles should be less than 1:1.5 and should reflect a substantially circular cross section or spherical particle. The circularity, roundness or roughness of the particle can be measured by a microscopic inspection of the particles in which an automated or manual measurement of roughness can be calculated. In such a measurement, the perimeter of a representative selection of the particulate is selected and the area of the particle cross section is also measured. The roundness of the particle is calculated by the following formula: Circularity=(perimeter)2/area. An ideal spherical particle has a roundness characteristic of about 12.6. This roundness characteristic is unitless parameter of less than about 20, often about 13 to 18. Metal and finely divided metal compositions that can be used in the composites of the invention include, but are not limited to, titanium, chromium, iron, nickel, molybdenum, tin tungsten, cobalt, copper, zinc, cadmium, bismuth, uranium, osmium, iridium, platinum, rhenium, gold, neptunium, plutonium and tantalum. An advantage is that non-toxic or non-radioactive materials can be used as a substitute for lead and depleted uranium where needed. Another advantage of the invention is the ability to create bimetallic or higher composites that use two or more metal materials that cannot naturally form an alloy. A variety of properties can be tailored through a careful selection of metal or a combination of metals and polymer and the toxicity or radioactivity of the materials can be designed into the materials as desired., 105611=Rhenium (Re) has an atomic weight of 186.207; an atomic number of 75 and is in Group VIIB(7). Naturally occurring isotopes are 185 (37.07%); 187 (62.93%), the latter is radioactive, T1/2\u02dc1011 years; artificial radioactive isotopes are 177-184; 186; 188-192. Rhenium comprises about 0.001 ppm of the earth's crust. It occurs in gadolinite, molybdenite, columbite, rare earth minerals, and some sulfide ores. Rhenium was discovered by Nodack et al, Naturwiss. 13, 567, 571 (1925). Preparation of metallic rhenium by reduction of potassium perrhenate or ammonium perrhenate is found in Hurd, Brim, Inorg. Syn 1, 175 (1939) and preparation of high purity rhenium is found in Rosenbaum et al., J. Electrochem. Soc. 103, 18 (1956). Reviews: Mealaven in rare Metals Handbook, C. A. Hampel, Ed. (Reinhold, New York, 1954) pp 347-364; Peacock in Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry Vol. 3, J. C. Bailar, Jr. et al., Eds. (Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1973) pp 905-978; P. M. Treichel in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology Vol. 20 (Wiley-Interscience, New York, 3rd ed., 1982) pp 249-258. Rhenium has hexagonal close-packed crystals, black to silver-gray; has a density of d 21.02; melting point of 3180\ufffd C.; boiling point of 5900\ufffd C. (estimated); specific heat of 0-20\ufffd C. 0.03263 cal/g/\ufffd C.; specific electrical resistance of 0.21\ufffd10\u22124 ohm/cm at 20\ufffd C.; Brinell hardness of 250; latent heat of vaporization of 152 kcal/mol and reacts with oxidizing acids, nitric and concentrated sulfuric acid, but not with HCl. In summary, Rhenium has a melting point of 3180\ufffd C., boiling point of 5900\ufffd C. (estimated) and density of 21.02., 69855=We have further found tat a bimetallic blend or a blend of three or more metal particulates can, obtain important composite properties from the blended metals in a polymer composite structure. For example, a tungsten composite or other high density metal can be blended with a second metal that provides to the relatively stable, non-toxic tungsten material, additional properties including a low degree of radiation in the form of alpha, beta or gamma particles, a low degree of desired cytotoxicity, a change in appearance or other beneficial properties. One advantage of a bimetallic composite is obtained by careful selection of proportions resulting in a tailored density for a particular end use. For example. a copper/tungsten composite can be produced having a theoretical density, for example, with a fluoropolyrmer or fluorocarbon that can range from 7 gm-cm\u22123 through 11.4 gm-cm\u22123. For example, a tantalum/tungsten composite can be produced having a theoretical density, for example, with a (fluoropolymer that can range from 11 gm-cm\u22123 through 12.2 gm-cm\u22123. Alternatively, for other applications, an iridium/tungsten composite can be manufactured that, with a fluoropolymer or fluoropolymer elastomer, can have a density that ranges front about 12 to about 13.2 gm-cm\u22123. Such composites each can have unique or special properties. The extrudable material having high density that can be extruded into useful shapes include a material having a composite density of about 4 to 17 gm-cm\u22123, preferably about 6 to 16 gm-cm\u22123, at an extruded shear rate, in common processing equipment that ranges from about 1 sec\u22121 to about 500 sec\u22121, preferably about 10 to about 250 sec\u22121 at a temperature of greater than about 100\ufffd C., and preferably 150 to 180\ufffd C., although for some materials it may be more preferable to process at temperatures above 180\ufffd C. The tensile strength can be about 0.2 to 60 MPa, the storage modulus of the composite (G1) ranges from about 300 to about 14,000 MPa, preferably from about 1200 to 14,000 MPa, and most preferably from about 3000 to about 7000 MPa and a tensile modulus of at least 0.2 to 200 MPa. One important characteristic of the extrudable material of the invention relates to the existence of an elastic-plastic deformation and its Poisson ratio. The extruded materials of the invention display an elastic plastic deformation. Under a stress that causes the extruded to elongate, the structure deforms in an elastic mode until it reaches a limit after which it deforms in a plastic mode until it reaches its limit and fails structurally. This property is shown as the elongation at break in which the material elongates under stress by at least 10% before reaching a limit and breaking under continued stress. The preferred material has a Poisson ratio typically less than 0.5 and preferably about 0.1 to about 0.5. Such a Poisson ratio indicates that it can be extruded with little elastic relaxation during processing., 119119=Polyphenylene oxide materials are engineering thermoplastics that are useful at temperature ranges as high as 330\ufffd C. Polyphenylene oxide has excellent mechanical properties, dimensional stability, and dielectric characteristics. Commonly, phenylene oxides are manufactured and sold as polymer alloys or blends when combined with other polymers or fiber. Polyphenylene oxide typically comprises a homopolymer of 2,6-dimethyl-1-phenol. The polymer commonly known as poly(oxy-(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene)). Polyphenylene is often used as an alloy or blend with a polyamide, typically nylon 6-6, alloys with polystyrene or high impact styrene and others. A preferred melt index (ASTM 1238) for the polyphenylene oxide material useful in the invention typically ranges from about 1 to 20, preferably about 5 to 10 gm/10 min. The melt viscosity is about 1000 at 265\ufffd C., 84036=The following are examples of useful metals. Titanium has a symbol Ti, an atomic weight of 47.867 and common valence of 2, 3, 4 (mostly tetravalent). The metal is in Group IVB (4) It is the ninth most abundant element in earth's crust; 0.63% by wt.

The metal forms alloys with aluminum, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, nickel, tin. The metal can be used as an alloy with copper and iron in titanium bronze, as addition to steel to impart great tensile strength and to aluminum to impart resistance to attack by aqueous salt and by organic acids., 133579=Fluorinated poly(meth)acrylates can generally be prepared by free radical polymerization either neat or in solvent, using radical initiators well known to those skilled in the art. Other monomers which can be copolymerized with these fluorinated (meth)acrylate monomers include alkyl (meth)acrylates, substituted alkyl (meth)acrylates, (meth)acrylic acid, (meth)acrylamides, styrenes, vinyl halides, and vinyl esters. The fluoropolymers can comprise polar constituents. Such polar groups or polar group containing monomers may be anionic, nonionic, cationic, or amphoteric. In general, the more commonly employed polar groups or polar group-containing organic radicals include organic acids, particularly carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid and phosphonic acid; carboxylate salts, sulfonates, phosphonates, phosphate esters, ammonium salts, amines, amides, alkyl amides, alkyl aryl amides, imides, sulfonamides, hydroxymethyl, thiols, esters, silanes, and polyoxyalkylenes, as well as other organic radicals such as alkylene or arylene substituted with one or more of such polar groups. The latex fluoropolymers described herein are typically aqueous dispersed solids but solvent materials can be used. The fluoropolymer can be combined with various solvents to form emulsion, solution or dispersion in a liquid form. Dispersions of fluoropolymers can be prepared using conventional emulsion polymerization techniques, such as described in U.S. Pat.

Tantalum was discovered by Edeberg in 1802; first obtained pure by Bolton in Z. Elektrochem. 11, 45 (1905). Preparation is found in Schoeller, Powell, J. Chem. Soc. 119, 1927 (1921). Reviews: G. L. Miller, Tantalum and Niobium (Academic Press, New York, 1959) 767 pp; Brown, \u201cThe Chemistry of Niobium and Tantalum\u201d in Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry Vol. 3, J. C. Bailar, Jr. et al., Eds. (Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1973) pp 553-622. Tantalum is a gray, very hard, malleable, ductile metal that can be readily drawn in fine wires; has a melting point of 2996\ufffd C.; a boiling point of 5429\ufffd C., a density of d 16.69; specific heat 0\ufffd C.: 0.036 cal/g/\ufffd C.; electrical resistivity (18\ufffd C.): 12.4 \u03bcohm-cm; insoluble in water; very resistant to chemical attack; not attacked by acids other than hydrofluoric and not attacked by aqueous alkalis; slowly attacked by fused alkalis. It reacts with fluorine, chlorine and oxygen only on heating and at high temperatures absorbs several hundred times its volume of hydrogen; combines with nitrogen, with carbon. In summary, Tantalum has a melting point of 2996\ufffd C., boiling point of 5429\ufffd C. and a density of d 16.69., 117811=A variety of polyester condensation polymer materials including polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polybutylene naphthalate, etc. can be useful in the composites of the invention. Polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate are high performance condensation polymer materials. Such polymers often made by a copolymerization between a diol (ethylene glycol, 1,4-butane diol) with dimethyl terephthalate. In the polymerization of the material, the polymerization mixture is heated to high temperature resulting in the transesterification reaction releasing methanol and resulting in the formation of the engineering plastic. Similarly, polyethylene naphthalate and polybutylene naphthalate materials can be made by copolymerizing as above using as an acid source, a naphthalene dicarboxylic acid. The naphthalate thermoplastics have a higher Tg and higher stability at high temperature compared to the terephthalate materials. However, all these polyester materials are useful in the composite materials of the invention. Such materials have a preferred molecular weight characterized by melt flow properties. Useful polyester materials have a viscosity at 265\ufffd C. of about 500-2000 cP, preferably about 800-1300 cP., 87565=Nickel has a symbol Ni, an atomic weight of 58.6934, a common valence 2 and is in Group VIII(10).

With a density of d4 20 22.61, it has been long believed to be the densest element. X-ray data has shown it to be slightly less dense than iridium with a melting point of about 2700\ufffd C., boiling point of about 5500\ufffd C., a density of d4 20 22.61, specific heat (0\ufffd C.) 0.0309 cal/g/\ufffd C. and hardness 7.0 on Mohs' scale. Osmium is stable in cold air and, when finely divided, is slowly oxidized by air even at ordinary temperature to form tetroxide. Osmium is attacked by fluorine above 100\ufffd C., by dry chlorine on heating, but not attacked by bromine or iodine. Osmium is attacked by aqua regia, by oxidizing acids over a long period of time, but barely affected by HCl, H2SO4. Osmium burns in vapor of phosphorus to form a phosphide, in vapor of sulfur to form a sulfide. Osmium is also attacked by molten alkali hydrosulfates, by potassium hydroxide and oxidizing agents. Finely divided osmium absorbs a considerable amount of hydrogen.
