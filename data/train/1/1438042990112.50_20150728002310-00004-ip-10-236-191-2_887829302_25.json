    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{6830=I took a variety of classes and enjoyed each and everyone of them. My favorite class of my 2008 fall semester was intro to sociology with Dr. George Sanders. We covered a wide range of topics, and Dr. Sanders employed a wide range of teaching techniques. Although I am a music major, and do not necessarily need to know the inns and outs of sociology, I will carry the knowledge I gained from this course with me forever, and I will continue to take sociology classes as electives., 417254=From what I have seen from my two campus visits, the dorms are great. Oak View Hall, the new dorm built in 2014, is extremely high-quality, and even the normal freshman dorms are better than they were expected to be. Hygiene is emphasized, especially during the winter months when flu viruses start going around, and students have free access to things like laundry facilities, toilet paper, bathrooms, tutoring centers and study halls, kitchen appliances/essentials, and more. The relationships with peers built in the dorms is also a great experience., 23056=Heard and Seen great things at this school of choice. I attended Project Upward Bound in the summer of 2006 an loved the campus an environment., 159051=I'm guessing the food isn't great because OU isn't a residence school. There is one cafeteria in Vandenberg Hall and one food court in the Oakland Center. The hours are good for commuters but the food places close by 6:30 or 7 on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The food quality is great when there's an orientation group or a tour coming through but otherwise it's nothing desirable. They offer very limited vegetarian and vegan options., 317011=Oakland University offers many trips throughout the school year at extremely discounted prices. For example, I traveled to Boston with a group of about 80-90 OU students in 2011. A modest price of approximately $325 covered the mega bus expenses, a 3 night stay in a ritzy hotel, and a 3 day subway pass. It is really awesome that OU has these types of opportunities available to students on a budget., 438935=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 38880=We have Homecoming in Winter... That may sound strange, but it is because we only started a football team this year. But no worries! They're changing it to Fall this 2014., 158543=There is a Bike Share program where the school funds bikes for students to ride around campus. There are lots of events sponsored by the Residence Hall Association such as sibling weekend and a haunted house in October., 419445=Oakland University is everything I have looked for in a school. Its campus is beautiful, the staff is very welcoming and friendly, and I feel like it will become a second home to me when I begin attending in the fall 2015 semester. With a variety of academic programs, helpful on-campus resources, and great academic advisers, any student with initiative can succeed here.}",

    "textAfterTable": "This school is very affordable because it doesn't require it's students to live on campus. However, things can get quite frustrating when the financial aid office doesn't complete things in a timely manner which can cause scrambling close to the start of the new semester. The quality of the classes are definitely worth the price. Am enjoying being here I love this campus! It is an absolutely gorgeous campus that is not too big and not too small. The students here are also of a good quality and they try their best to help you to feel at home on campus. Am learning a lot Throughout high school I was never challenged but as soon as I came to OU that all changed. The professors have been pretty good for the most part and they have challenged me to think critically which is a lost art in our society today.
