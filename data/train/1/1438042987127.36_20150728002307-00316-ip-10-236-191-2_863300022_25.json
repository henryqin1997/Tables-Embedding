How did you get involved with Linux and Open Source, and what was the path that lead to you to Gentoo? I started using Linux at the end of 1996. Originally I switched to Linux because with the slow Internet connections of the times, web pages would take a long time to load. I would often open dozens of windows so I could be reading on site while others were loading. After a certain number of open browsers, Windows 95 would start to bog down then just crash, while when I did the same thing on Linux it would just happily chug along. Around 2001, when Gnome 2 came out, I wanted to try out, and I don\u2019t like installing software outside of the package manager, so I attempted to get the rpms from the rawhide repository. This experience made me decide to look for a different distro, and I ended up liking Gentoo the most., 69477=No GLSAs have been released on January 2015.

Since November 7th, if a package is only compatible with a single\u00a0supported Python version (say, python-2.7), then it no longer uses\u00a0python_single_target_* use flags and relies instead on that implementation being enabled in PYTHON_TARGETS., 439651=The following tables and charts summarize the activity on Bugzilla between 31 May 2014 and 30 June 2014.
