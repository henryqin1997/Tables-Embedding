            "The cafeteria provides a wonderful diverse selection of food for three meals a day. There is always a fruit bar, a salad bar, and pizza as well as three options for a main course and dozens of side dishes. The food is almost always delicious. The cafeteria also provides to go boxes and drinks for students that don't have time to sit down to eat. However, there isn't always enough seating.",
            "Because of the small student body, students are given the opportunity to possibly meet and get to know the entire school. Instead of conventional dorms, the school bought an apartment complex which provides more of a home feel than a summer camp feel. There are lots of activities and intramurals available for everyone, and the Resident Assistants are extremely helpful.",
            "The basic general education courses are in some ways more simple than highschool. Many professors can be easily manipulated by students, or tricked into giving less work or more extra credit assignments. The academic bar is set very low.",
            "Take advantage of your professors as a resource. They are always available for questions and tutoring. Take advantage of the free student life events. Appreciate the small college aspect.",
            "San Diego Christian College is the perfect place for those looking for an intimate education experience. The professors will take a genuine interest in your academic success, and do everything they can to help you succeed. The overall student body provides a welcoming and accepting campus for everyone."
