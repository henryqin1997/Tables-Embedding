Each syllable has an appended form, which kill the previous syllable sound. The appended form appears below the syllable that precedes it.

The appended form of SA and YA appear below and after the syllable that precede them. In Balinese, the basic syllable is called Ak\u015bara Wre\u015f\u0101stra. The appended form of the syllable in general is called Pangangge Ak\u015bara. The one that is hanging below is called Gantungan while the one that appears after the syllable is called Gempelan.
