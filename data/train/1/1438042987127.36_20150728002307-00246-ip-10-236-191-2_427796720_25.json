In 2005 he made his Kent second XI debut against Durham and scored 96, as well as playing for England Under-15s. In 2006 he was included in a strong Getty XI against the touring Sri Lankans, scoring 62., 51441=Northeast's 2014 season felt like a watershed. Despite his vice captaincy, he was briefly dropped to the 2nd XI following a dismal start to the Championship campaign which saw him score just 178 runs in his first 12 innings at an average of 15. But he was recalled against Leicestershire in July and responded with four hundreds - the first of them ending a two-year drought. Previously tried as opener and No 3, he seemed more at home at No 5. Runs were also plentiful in the limited-overs formats., 57474=May 29, 2015, 52850=He enjoyed an excellent tri-series in Sri Lanka in 2007 - putting on 152 with Billy Godleman in one of the matches - and was part of England's Under-19 World Cup squad in 2008. He travelled with the Under-19 squad to South Africa in January 2009, and was also part of the group that played Bangladesh at home in July. His county career began to develop promisingly too, and he scored his maiden first-class century, against Gloucestershire, at the end of the 2009 season. He solidified his place in 2010 despite struggling in the Championship, scoring 688 runs at 24.57, though he was hardly the only Kent batsman to suffer a lean season, and by the following year was an established member of their line-up., 60220=NBC Denis Compton Award 2009,2010, 70671=The Cricket Monthly: The IPL lasts two months, but through the year talent hunters are scouring India (and the internet) for the next big thing. By Niyantha Shekar TCM July issue, 51001=Sam Northeast has been marked out as a cricketer with leadership potential from an early age, and Kent put their faith in him by naming the 24 year old the county's vice-captain for 2014. His name was being murmured around the county while he was still a schoolboy and he appears set to become a key figure in the squad in the future., 77819=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 53601=It was the 2012 season that appeared to be Northeast's coming-of-age campaign, however. Still only 22, he first had to fight his way back into the Championship side, after being dropped to the seconds, and responded with a string of good scores. Come the end of the season he had accumulated 880 second division runs at an average of 55, with three hundreds and five half-centuries. In all competitions his run tally finished just short of 1,400 and he was rewarded with Kent's batsman of the year award. 2013 was more of a struggle with the bat for Northeast who averaged just 26 in the County Championship, but he scored a maiden one-day century against Sussex in a successful run chase in the YB40 competition., 59108=Sep 4, 2014, 58313=Apr 20, 2015, 73741=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 34519=Born October 16, 1989, Ashford, Kent}",
