Vicat Softening Point is the temperature at which a flat-nosed needle of 1 mm2 circular cross section penetrates a thermoplastic specimen to a depth of 1 mm under a specified load using a uniform rate of temperature rise (ASTM D 1525, hereby incorporated by reference thereto, in its entirety). Preferably the first component has a Vicat Softening Point of from 1\ufffd C. to 100\ufffd C. higher than the Vicat Softening Point of the second component; more preferably 10\ufffd C. to 75\ufffd C. higher; still more preferably, 20\ufffd C. to 50\ufffd C. higher. However, the greater the difference in Vicat Softening Point, the greater the potential for enhancing the advantages provided by the present invention., 212660=Corona treatment of polymeric materials is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,120,716, to BONET, issued Oct. 17, 1978, herein incorporated in its entirety by reference thereto, discloses improved adherence characteristics of the surface of polyethylene by corona treatment, to oxidize the polyethylene surface.

Layer #9 was ESCORENE PD 3445 \u2122 (heterogeneous) polypropylene homopolymer, also obtained from Exxon Chemical Company., 90783=As used herein, the phrase \u201cfree shrink\u201d refers to the percent dimensional change in a 10 cm\ufffd10 cm specimen of film, when subjected to selected heat, as measured by ASTM D 2732, as known to those of skill in the art., 231845=Table VII, above, describes the seven-layer blown, coextruded film produced according to this Example. This seven-layer film is useful in substantially the same applications as described for the films of Examples 1 and 2. In the film of Table VII, produced according to this Example, the following is the identity of the various resins used in each of the seven layers. Layer #1 is a blend of: (a) 65 weight percent EXACT 3027 \u2122 homogeneous ethylene/alpha-olefin 0.900 g/cc resin, obtained from the Exxon Chemical Company, of Baytown, Tex., and (b) 35 weight percent Vistalon\u2122 ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer resin (\u201cEPDM\u201d, also known as ethylene-propylene rubber), also obtainable from the Exxon Chemical Company.

Layer #4 is EVAL E101 \u2122 ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer resin, i.e., a 38 mole percent ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, which is produced and distributed by the Eval Co. of America, of Lisle, Ill. Layer #6 is PLEXAR 107 \u2122 anhydride modified EVA resin, obtainable from Quantum Chemical Company, of Pittsburgh, Penn. Layer #7 is CAPRON 8207 \u2122 polyamide resin, also obtainable from the Allied Signal Inc., 224818=The film of Table VI, i.e., according to Example 2, had a total thickness of about 2 to 4 mils. The various resins in the layers were as follows: Layer #1 was SURLYN 1650 \u2122 ethylene methacrylic acid copolymer resin, wherein the acid had been partially neutralized with a zinc base, such as zinc acetate. The SURLYN 1650 \u2122 ethylene methacrylic acid copolymer resin was obtained from E.I. DuPont de Nemours, of Wilmington, Del. Layers #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7 had the same chemical composition as the same-numbered layers of the nine-layer film of Example 1.

Layer #9 was ULTRAMID B35 polyamide resin, obtained from BASF Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., 220963=In a corona treated state of from about 36 to 60 dyne/cm sec, the oxidized surface of the film increases the compatibility of the surface sealant layer, so as to provide even greater seal strength between the surface layer blend and sealants which are generally recognized as being incompatible with ionomer resins, such as SURLYN 1601 \u2122 ionomer resin, SURLYN 1705 \u2122 ionomer resin, and SURLYN 1650 \u2122 ionomer resin. Because the outer heat-resistant forming layer is composed of polypropylene homopolymer, the treated outer sealant layer does not cause excessive blocking to occur., 56351=The outer sealant layer, in film according to the present invention, can further comprise an anhydride functionality. The presence of the anhydride functionality is especially advantageous if the film is to be used in a cook-in application, and the outer sealant layer is to be in direct contact with a product comprising meat. The anhydride functionality increases the degree of meat adhesion obtained, thereby preventing purge during cook-in.
