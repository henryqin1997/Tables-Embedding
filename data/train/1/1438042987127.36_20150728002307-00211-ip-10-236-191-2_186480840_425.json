It featured articles, humor (including the monthly Kitchen Table International satire/parody column), letters and reviews about the TRS-80 microcomputer built by Tandy Corporation and sold through Radio Shack. Another major feature was program listings for the machine, primarily written in BASIC and Z80 assembly language. These programs were printed in the magazine, but could be purchased on cassette tape and diskette media under the name Load 80 to save some typing. Starting out under the name \"80 Microcomputing\", the magazine was renamed to \"80 Micro\" on its 30th issue.
