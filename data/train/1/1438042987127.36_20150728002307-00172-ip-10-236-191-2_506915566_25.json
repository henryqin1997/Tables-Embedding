The expenditures have been circumscribed; and the recommendation to encroach still further on the fund, by erecting other dwellings at other stations, has not been complied with. The fund should be sacredly reserved for the immediate and personal benefit of those from whose earnings it has accrued.

The three first will return in 1846, and will he relieved by the Congress, the Portsmouth, and the Cyane. The difficulty of communicating with our ships in the Pacific makes it proper to suggest the advantage of a public mail through our own territory to a convenient port on the straits of Juan de Fuca. Arrangements should also be made at the earliest day that is proper, for getting supplies for our Pacific squadron from our own soil and our own citizens in that region., 12283=August, 1845, 28600=The law of January 31, 1823, requires that disbursing officers who fail to render their accounts for settlement in due time, shall be promptly reported to the President of the United States, and dismissed from the public service.

The law of August 26, 1842, gives them \"on leave, or waiting orders, the same pay as surgeons;\" that is, large and increasing pay, according to the number of years they have been in the service, without reference to their sea duty or present merit. Under the operation of this law, the old purser doing nothing on shore is frequently paid more than the faithful young purser whom duty carries round the world. The consequence is, naturally, a great love of the shore. Will not Congress remedy this, and make it for the pecuniary interest of pursers to perform their duty at sea? If this can be accomplished, their number needs no increase., 169=List of resignations in the navy, since December 1, 1844., 59753=The African squadron was organized by Commodore Perry, by whom good sanitary regulations were established.

The Marion and the Dolphin followed as a reinforcement. The Boxer is destined for the same station, and will sail immediately.

It is advancing as rapidly as a due regard to its proper construction, and the means applied to it, will allow. Order and regularity are observable in the arrangement of its details, and it is believed that an economical and steady employment of the mechanics will in a short time produce an appearance and result that will be gratifying to the department. It was begun originally under Mr. Courtenay, on the 1st of October, 1841; was continued to 1st August, 1842, when the works were suspended. During that period, the sum of $35,264 75 was expended for every purpose. The works were again resumed on the 10th of October, 1844, under General McNeill. Between that time and the 1st of April, when he was succeeded by the present engineer, Mr. Sanger, the sum of $114,671 83 was expended. Since the first of April, of the present year, up to the first of October, to which time the engineer's report is made up, the sum of $51,236 75 has been expended. The, sums of these three expenditures form an aggregate of $201,168 50; which has been expended on the dock for all purposes connected therewith, from its commencement in October, 1841, to the 30th September last. To continue the work through the succeeding fiscal year, the engineer thinks the sum of 2250,400 may be profitably appropriated, and that sum, less $400, has therefore been inserted, for that purpose, under the proper head. I forward with this the report of W. P. S. Sanger, esq., the chief engineer, which gives a specific, clear, and concise view of the whole subject, and will enable you to ascertain with precision the progress and condition of the whole work. The little time which has elapsed since its receipt has prevented the making of a copy; I have therefore to request that it may be returned at your convenience, that it may be preserved for reference., 490648=This fund, on the first of October, 1845, amounted to one hundred and seventy-five thousand seven hundred and twenty-three dollars and thirty cents. The hospital fund has considerably diminished during the last year, in consequence of the expenditure for improvements, authorized in 1844, as well as the increased number of pensioners in the naval asylum. The improvements made by Commodore Morgan during the last year on the naval asylum grounds have been extensive. Houses for the governor and surgeon, walls for the southern and eastern part of the grounds, a cemetery, and stables, have all been erected during the last year., 429161=The amount which will be required for objects under the direction of this bureau, payable from the appropriation for increase, repair, armament, and equipment of the navy, and for wear and tear of vessels in commission, for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1847, is estimated as follows, viz:, 35155=Estimated for 1845-'6., 5785=July 1, 1845., 576512=Bounty for re-enlistments, per act of March 2, 1833, two months' rations, 734801=We Aymar & Co., 455713=Statement of the cost or estimated value of stores on hand at the several navy yards, July 1, 1844; of articles received and expended from June 30, 1844, to June 30, 1845; and of those remaining on hand July 1, 1845, which are under the direction of the Bureau of Construction Equipment, and Repairs., 457184=On hand July 1, 1815., 406218=Washington, October 20, 1845,, 453056=Statement of the vessels belonging to the navy, which were in ordinary on the 1st of October, 1845., 5107=April 27, 1845., 471523=Estimate of provisions required for the United States navy for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1846, and ending June 30, 1847., 478686=Estimate of the expense of the Bureau of \"Provisions and Clothing\" for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1846, and ending June 30, 1847., 646015=The contractor is to deliver these supplies at the navy yard into the custody of the naval store-keeper, in appropriate packages, free of all expenses and charges for transportation.

This discrepancy is explained by the recent settlements in the Fourth Auditor's office, by which settlements sums that were credited to different navy agents have reverted to the special appropriations from which they were drawn. The monthly statement, dated November 1, is as follows:, 746690=April 11, 1845., 564212=Estimate of the expenses of the Quartermaster's department of the marine corps for one year from July 1, 1846., 760049=Proposals, sealed and endorsed, will be received at this bureau until 3 o'clock p. m., of the 16th June next, for furnishing and delivering the following quantities of flax and cotton canvass, hammock and bag stuff, and flax and cotton twine, viz:, 27059=General estimate of the sums required for the support of the office of the Secretary of the Navy, and the several bureaus of the Navy Department, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1847., 489233=There has been expended for surgeons' necessaries and appliances, including what remains in the hands of navy agents to meet approved bills on the first of October, 1845}",
