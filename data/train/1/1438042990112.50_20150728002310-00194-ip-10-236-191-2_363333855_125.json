Cisco IOS XE Release 3.3S This command was integrated into Cisco IOS XE Release 3.3S. 15.2(4)S This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S. Usage Guidelines Use the aaa accounting command to enable and specify the method list for AAA accounting for IPsec sessions. The aaa accounting command can be specific to an authentication method or common to all authentication methods, but not both at the same time. If no method list is specified, the list is common across authentication methods. Examples The following example defines an AAA accounting configuration common to all authentication methods:  Router(config-ikev2-profile)# aaa accounting common-list1 The following example configures an AAA accounting for each authentication method:  Router(config-ikev2-profile)# aaa",
