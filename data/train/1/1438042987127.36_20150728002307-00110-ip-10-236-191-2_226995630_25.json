    "textBeforeTable": "Andrews Chevrolet Superlate Models Qualifying Results By: Michelle Sprague Trei Deubel was not only the Q106 Pony Stock fast qualifier, but also scored a heat win and another feature win. Deubel started 10th in the field, and led by lap four to set sail for another easy victory. Julie Dailey marched through the field to sit in fourth by lap 13, and second three laps later. Bryan Passick II had a stellar run, ending the night in third in a borrowed pony. Brent McCort and John Conroy made a charge for the front with laps winding down, and finished fourth and fifth, respectively. Jason Brunn also scored a heat win. The Andrews Chevrolet Super Late Models saw the veteran, Stan Perry tally another win on Andrews Chevrolet Night at Spartan Speedway. Bill Heeney Jr. and Perry both wanted the top spot after start of the 40-lap feature, with Heeney Jr. grabbing it from lap one leader, Evan Barrett, on lap two. From then on, until lap 35, Perry had to be content staring at Heeney Jr\u2019s rear bumper, trying to find a way around him. Lee Taylor sat in third, while Jon McNett and Jimmy Gallagher went at it for fourth position. The outside groove worked for Perry on lap 34, when he and Heeney Jr. battled door handle to door handle,",
