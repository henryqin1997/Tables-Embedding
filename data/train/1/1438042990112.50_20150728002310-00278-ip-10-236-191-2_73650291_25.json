    "textBeforeTable": "Initial runtime behavior corresponds to the row for the attribute value being created in the entity table. If the default value is read only, it cannot subsequently be changed through the user interface. If the default value is not read only, users can modify it. However, if the segment value is a derived value, a user-modified segment value is overwritten when the derivation value changes. Different combinations of making the segments read only or editable in combination with the default or derivation value or both, have different effects. When defaulting or deriving a default value from a parameter, only those attributes designated by development as parameters are available to be chosen. To synchronize a segment's value with another field's value whenever it changes, specify the derivation value to be the flexfield parameter from which to derive the attribute's value. Whenever the parameter value changes, the attribute's value is changed to match. If you derive an attribute from a parameter, consider making the attribute read-only, as values entered by users are lost whenever the parameter value changes. To populate a flexfield segment with a default value when a row is created, specify a default type of constant or parameter and a default value. Defaulting and Deriving Segment Values: Explained When you deploy a flexfield, the value sets assigned to the segments of the flexfield provide end users with the valid values for the attributes represented by the segments.

Deployment generates or refreshes the Application Development Framework (ADF) business component objects that render the flexfield in a user interface. Flexfields are deployed for the first time during the application provisioning process. You can deploy a flexfield to a sandbox for testing or to the mainline for use. Deployment Status Every flexfield has a deployment status. A flexfield can have the following deployment statuses. Deployment Status Meaning Edited The flexfield metadata definition has not been deployed yet. Updates of the metadata definition are not applied in the runtime environment yet. Patched The flexfield metadata definition has been modified through a patch or through a data migration action, but the flexfield has not yet been deployed so the updated definition is not reflected in the runtime environment. Deployed to Sandbox The current metadata for the flexfield is deployed in ADF artifacts and available as a flexfield-enabled sandbox. The status of the sandbox is managed by the Manage Sandboxes task available to the Administrator menu of the Setup and Maintenance work area.",
