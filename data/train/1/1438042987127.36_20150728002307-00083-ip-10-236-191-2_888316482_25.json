            "Regarding the school specifically, I cannot answer this because I do not participate in school activities (I'm over 25 with a family). Spartanburg in general, however, has several downtown restaurants; one mall; a couple nearby zoos...it is pretty small, but neighboring Greenville has a lot to do.",

            "The nursing program is highly rated, but a little bit disorganized. The tuition is reasonable. Most of the professors are challenging, helpful, and want their students to succeed."

All of the dorms are suite style, but I had a single. So I had my own room but shared a common room and bathroom with four other people., 141624=USC Upstate is great for students who don't exactly want or are ready for a larger size campus but don't want a campus too small. Upstate is right in the middle. Class sizes are usually no more than 30-40 students and the student-to-teacher ratio is 18:1. Any student looking for a larger college experience without the cost and size would definitely be a great match for USC Upstate.}",

Coming to school 10 minutes early, if you commute, isn't a bad idea at all since parking is always an issue at Upstate. Bang for the buck I believe when you're a student at Upstate you get the bang for your buck because there is a small ratio of student to teachers. You are able to know your teacher on a personal level and they are able to help you while getting to know you. Our teachers care so much about our goals and they want to help you unlike other colleges with 300 students in each classroom. Am enjoying being here Even though, I commute I love USC Upstate because it's",
