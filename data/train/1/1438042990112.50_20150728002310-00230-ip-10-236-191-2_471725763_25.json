    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{44339=In response to these problems, much effort has focused on creation of compositions and methods to reduce or eliminate shrinkage-related stresses and marginal gaps in dental restorations. Reported approaches have included reliance on the \u201cflow\u201d of the composite during chemical self-curing, which proceeds slowly, (See, Davidson et al., \u201cThe Relaxation of Polymerization Stresses by Flow in Dental Composites\u201d, J.Dent.Res. 63(2): 146-148 (February, 1984)) or by incremental insertion of the composite in the restorative site (See Davidson, \u201cResisting the Curing Contraction with Adhesive Composites\u201d, J.Prosth.Dent. 55(1): 446-447 (April 1986.) The first \u201cflow\u201d study did not, however, investigate composite-dentin bonding and whether \u201cflow\u201d would obviate gap creation. Flow dissipation of shrinkage is also believed to be limited to self-cure chemical polymerization, which occurs over a period of at least several minutes, as opposed to light or heat induced polymerization, which is often completed in a matter of 12 minutes or less., 66281=Presently preferred comonomer portions include the admixture of two or more of such monomers. For example, Ethoxylated Bisphenol A Dimethacrylate and Hexa-function methacrylate ester in a ratio of from about 1:1 to about 4:1 have been found to have utility in the present invention., 42473=Although filled polymerizable composite resin compositions are in widespread use, certain problems are recognized to exist due to the nature of the compositions. For example, because such composites typically depend on polymerization reactions to effect hardening of the resin in place on the tooth surface, they exert stresses on the adjacent tooth structure due to shrinkage which occurs during polymerization as the monomers move from their free liquid state into their more dense, cross-linked polymerized state. Such shrinkage and resultant stresses are often considerable, particularly in a so-called \u201cClass V\u201d type restoration, wherein the restoration is being effected at the dentin-enamel junction at the cervical region of the tooth, and also in so-called \u201cClass I\u201d restorations such as deep cavities involving restorations contacting opposing walls of the tooth. See e.g., Feilzer et al., \u201cSetting Stress in Composite Resins in Relation to Configuration of the Restoration\u201d, J.Dent.Res. 66(11): 1636-1639 (November, 1987) and Davidson et al. \u201cThe Competition between the Composite-Dentin Bond Strength and the Polymerization Contraction Stress, J.Dent.Res. 63(12): 13961399 (December 1984), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Such shrinkage and related stresses have been reported as causing separation of the restoration from at least the dentin surface of the tooth, leading to the creation of marginal gaps at the interface between the restorative and the adjacent tooth surface and causing microleakage. Id. See also, Bausch et al., \u201cClinical significance of polymerization shrinkage of composite resins\u201d, J.Pros. Dent. 480): 59-67 (July, 1982), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Current commercial universal hybrid composites shrink from 2.2 to about 3.5% by volume fraction., 56290=One or more of the aforementioned fillers comprising the filler portion may also include caries inhibiting agents such as slow releasing fluoride agents to help inhibit caries from forming in the adjacent tooth structure. For example, glass ionomer IX 1944 from Ferro Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio, which contains a slow release fluoride agent, is expected to have utility in the present invention., 94648=Wear resistance was determined by Oral Wear Simulator 2000 (Proto-tech) and analyzed by Surfanalyzer (Sahr Federal Inc.). The composite was cured in a Teflon Mold (\u02dc15 mm diameter\ufffd3 mm thick) following by polishing with 1500 grit abrasive paper. The stylus was prepared by mounting a ceramic ball on the screw denture based acrylic resin. Using impression material, draw a bead around the top perimeter of the acrylic tube in which the specimen is mounted. The stylus travel distance was about 1 mm. The wear test was set as following conditions, 48674=It is an additional object of the present invention to include a polyurethane dimethacrylate oligomer with a soft segment and that has a relatively high average molecular weight (number average) from at least about 1500 or higher in dental composite compositions and restorative compositions to reduce the polymerization shrinkage and lower the contraction stress., 170592=An indirect technique to measure contraction stress built up in dental composite was constructed. A microstrain gauge was applied onto an acrylic ring to obtain the strain data as a representation of the contraction stress caused by the composite shrinkage as follows. A 3800 Strain Indicator with Model 2000 A/D Converter (Measurements Group, Raleigh, N.C.), and a strain gages (EA-13-062AP-120 or EA-06-062AP-120) were employed. The acrylic ring (9.6 mm OD and 6.3 mm ID) is cut into a 2.0 mm thick ring using the Isomet diamond saw. After briefly roughening the inner wall with 300 grit sand paper, Bisco One-Step adhesive is applied on to it twice following by 10 s light cure at 500 mW/cm2. The strain gage is attached to outside wall of acrylic ring using adhesive. A small amount (less than \ufffd) of composite is added into the ring to fill the bottom, and the composite is cured for 40 s at 500 mW/cm2. After 20 min, the microstrain data is read from the Strain Indicator. The following results were observed., 55811=Conventional fillers may also be used in combination with the spherical fillers and/or sub-micron fillers. For example, SR Glass RGW EG 2993 may be used in combination with either or both other types of fillers. Such conventional fillers are well-known in the art, and may be present in amount of from about 5 to about 75% of the composite, it being understood that its amount being dependent in part on the amount of spherical filler present in the composite, 56707=The filler or fillers are present at about 75 to about 95 weight percent of the contemplated compositions of the present invention, and are more preferably present at about 80 to about 92 or from about 84 to about 92 weight percent of the composition. The amount of the filler component is adjusted in view of the other components of the composition and in view of the intended use of the composition, it being well known in the art that higher filler amounts generally impart higher compressive strengths to a composition, but also tend to increase viscosity and decrease flowablity of the composition. Presently preferred fillers include silica particles from Suzuki Oil & Fat Corporation, Hyogo, Japan; silanated submicron glasses such as OX-50 or Aerosil R972 from DeGussa, Richfield Park, N.J.; and porcelain ground strontium glass such as EG2933 RWG from Ferro Electronic Glass, Cleveland, Ohio. Optionally, the filler portion is formulated to include appropriate coloring agents in varying amounts to provide the dental professional with a range of colors in the composition, which may be selected for compatibility with the shade of the patient's tooth undergoing restoration. Such coloring or tint agents are well known in the art, and may be included in small amount of about 1 weight percent or less of the total composition. Such fillers can also be selected to be radio opaque. For example, appropriate amounts of radio opaque barium, strontium or zirconium glass may be used as all or part of the filler portion, which can assist the dental professional in his or her post-treatment examination of the patient., 45394=Others have proposed multi-step application procedures using low viscosity, unfilled resins to seal the marginal gaps directly after initial curing of the composite, (See, Kemp-Scholte et al., \u201cMarginal Sealing of Curing Contraction Gaps in Class V Composite Resin Restorations\u201d, J.Dent.Res. 67(5): 841-845 (May, 1988)), or use of so-called \u201cflexible\u201d intermediate layers of unfilled resins or light-cured glass ionomer layers applied as a thin liner layer between the tooth surface and the composite. See, Kemp-Scholte et al., \u201cComplete Marginal Seal of Class V Resin Composite Restorations Effected by Increased Flexibility\u201d, J.Dent.Res. 69(6); 1240-1243 (June 1990). The later study reported that certain stress release liners, the traditional glass ionomers (Ioline), actually cracked and exhibited cohesive failures. Certain unfilled resins are also known to exhibit significant shrinkage and, generally become brittle upon curing. These multi-step, multi-material approaches also introduce complexity into the dental restoration process in terms of number of steps, materials, and increase the time spent and cost incurred by the dental professional and patient in the treatment process. In addition to exhibiting good adhesion and bonding, composites and other polymerizable dental restorative material must also withstand the compressive, tensile and other forces experienced by the tooth surface in the mouth. For example, considerable compressive forces are generated by contact from other teeth during chewing and other mouth movements. The restorative may also experience tensile and abrasive forces in the mouth depending on its location on or within the tooth's surfaces. In, for example, Class V restorations, shear forces are also experienced in the restoration during mastication. Such shear forces must also be absorbed and/or dissipated or the restoration may fail. See \u201cClinical Status of Praesens of Dentine Adhesives\u201d pp. 113-115, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference., 51187=The unique polyurethane dimethacrylate ester (PUDMA) oligomer, which is used in the composition and methods of the present invention, is a polyurethane oligomeric resin with dimethacrylate and which incorporates phenyl groups as a hard segment and ethylene glycol or polymethylene as a soft segment. The PUDMA oligomer of the present invention may be manufactured in the laboratory by well-known methods or may be purchased from commercial sources such as Methacrylate Ester IRR456) from UCB Chemicals Corporation, Drogenbos, Belgium. Such commercial monomers are available in average molecular weights (number average) of from about 1500 to about 5000. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that higher molecular weight oligomers of about 1500 or higher may require dissolution in a suitable diluent monomer before formulation in composition according to the present invention. At present, oligomers having an average molecular weight of less than 10,000 and greater than 1000, i.e. from about 1000 to about 2000 are more preferred in the present invention for reasons such as ease of formulation. PUDMA having an average molecular weight of about 1500 is presently a preferred oligomer. Presently preferred amounts of oligomer in compositions of the present invention are from about 1 to about 15 weight percent of the total composition. Presently more preferred amounts are in the range of about 7 to about 12 weight percent of the composition.}",
