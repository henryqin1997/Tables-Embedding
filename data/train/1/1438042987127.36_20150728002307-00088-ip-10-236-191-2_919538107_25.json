    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{53670=The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) is correcting final rules that appeared in the Federal Register of 78 FR 66288, November 5, 2013. The document issued final rules that establish a single protection scheme for tower construction and modification near AM tower arrays and designate \u201cmoment method\u201d computer modeling as the principal means of determining whether a nearby tower affects an AM radiation pattern. This correction makes no change to the substance of the rules., 83802=Title 47 published on 2014-10-01, 13357=In this document, the Commission announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved on December 5, 2014, for a period for three years, a revision to an information collection for the FCC Application for Radio Service Authorization for the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, FCC Form 601. With this document, the Commission is announcing OMB approval and the effective date of the revised requirements for FCC Form 601., 18128=This document contains corrections to the final regulations to the Commission's rules which were published in the Federal Register on Thursday, November 6, 2014 (79 FR 65906). The Commission published a clarification in the Declaratory Ruling, which clarifies how the Commission intends to preserve the \u201ccoverage area\u201d of eligible broadcasters in the repacking process associated with the broadcast television spectrum incentive auctions. This document contains corrections to the adopted date., 3002=In this document, the Media Bureau of the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) announced that, effective May 15, 2015, the September 1, 2015 digital transition date for low power television (LPTV) and TV translator stations is hereby suspended. The Commission will decide on a new transition date in the rulemaking proceeding in MB Docket No. 03-185. Until a decision is reached in the rulemaking and the Commission can determine the effect of the future incentive auction and repacking, LPTV and TV translator stations may delay completing construction of their digital facilities., 142143=The Federal Communications Commission published a document in the Federal Register of October 27, 2014 (79 FR 63883), regarding Petitions for Reconsideration filed of Action in a rulemaking proceeding. The document contained the incorrect deadline for filing replies to an opposition to the Petition. This document revises the deadline for replies to an opposition to the Petition., 69875=This document corrects an error that appears in the summary of Implementation of Competitive Bidding for Commercial Broadcast and Instructional Television Fixed Service Licenses, published in the Federal Register of Friday, September 11, 1998, 63 FR 48615. Paragraph 17 of the Federal Register summary erroneously omitted a requirement that winning bidders in broadcast service auctions pay an application fee when filing their long form applications., 80023=In this document, the Commission adopts LPFM and translator licensing policies that conform to the Local Community Radio Act (\u201cLCRA\u201d). The LCRA requires the FCC to balance the competing demands of LPFM and translator applicants when making licensing decisions. Section 5 of the Act requires the Commission to ensure that: licenses are available for both LPFM and translator stations; licensing decisions are based on community needs; and translator and LPFM stations remain equal in status. The item finds that a previously adopted cap on translator applications pending from Auction No. 83 is inconsistent with the LCRA's directives, and adopts a market-specific processing policy. The item finds that this approach most faithfully implements Section 5's directives, and will allow the Commission to resume the processing of approximately 6,500 translator applications that have been pending since 2003, while also ensuring that the upcoming LPFM window will provide a real opportunity for significant community radio licensing in major metropolitan areas. The item also adopts national and market caps to prevent the trafficking of translator construction permits. Finally, the item relaxes the May 1, 2009, date restriction to allow pending translator applications from Auction No. 83 that are subsequently granted to rebroadcast the signals of AM stations at night.}",
