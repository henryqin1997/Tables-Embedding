            "CENTRALLY CONTROLLED ROUTING WITH TAGGED PACKET FORWARDING IN A WIRELESS MESH NETWORK - Embodiments of the present invention include a method, an apparatus, and logic encoded in one or more computer-readable tangible medium to carry out a method. One method includes tagging packets and forwarding packets in a wireless mesh network using stored forwarding information for the tag, wherein the forwarding information is according to a centrally determined routing method and tag distribution method.",
            "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SECURING MESH ACCESS POINTS IN A WIRELESS MESH NETWORK, INCLUDING RAPID ROAMING - Authentication in a mesh network controlled by a central controller, including using standard IEEE 802.11i mechanisms between a potential child mesh access point (AP) as supplicant and the controller as authenticator. Each mesh AP in the mesh network has a secure tunnel to a controller using a protocol for controlling the mesh AP, including AP capabilities, and a fast roaming method for re-establishing a secure layer-2 link with a new parent mesh AP including, while the mesh AP is a child mesh AP to the first parent mesh AP and has a secure layer-2 link to the first parent mesh AP, caching key information and wireless mesh network identity information in the controller.",
            "ACCESS POINT PROFILE FOR A MESH ACCESS POINT IN A WIRELESS MESH NETWORK - A mesh access point that includes an access point profile storing one ore more parameters in non-volatile memory, and a method of using the mesh access point having the access point profile to select and carry out mutual authentication on a wireless mesh network to establish itself to the mesh network using information in the access point profile, and further to provide services to wireless clients according to information in the access point profile. Access point profiles can be pre-configured/configured/updated suitably in order to adapt the mesh access point in a mesh network according to its capabilities and requirements."

One method includes maintaining a mesh topology data structure containing information on the tree topology of a wireless mesh network. The method further includes using a tree-walking method to send an upgrade message to the root access point and to each other mesh point in the wireless mesh network until each mesh point has received the upgrade message. Receiving the upgrade message enables the receiving mesh point to upgrade according to the contents of the upgrade message without necessarily disrupting the mesh network.</td> <td>20140044016</td> <tr> </tr> <td>01-24-2013</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20130021906\">Dynamic Management of Network Flows</a> - A plurality of flow network elements monitors network flows at the subscriber level for a plurality of subscribers.

Rahman, Morgan Hill, CA US Shariar Rahman, San Jose, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20110242994 FLOW SAMPLING WITH TOP TALKERS - An improved network flow sampling apparatus and corresponding method more intelligently selects flows to be reported beyond random flow or packet sampling intervals. Evaluation of flows selects top talkers or heavy hitters as important flows that most impact traffic and therefore should be reported. Top talkers are flows defined based on a customized definition according to, for example, number of packets in a flow, number of bytes in a flow, or bandwidth consumed by a flow. An external collector can thus proceed with traffic profiling or other flow monitoring purposes with a more intelligently determined network flow sample. 10-06-2011 Sharif Mustafizur Rahman, Fremont, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20130311356 Secure File Transfer with Electronic Payment Integration - A system for securely transferring an electronic package from one user to another includes a mechanism for requiring payment from the recipient of an electronic package before the recipient is permitted to receive the package.
