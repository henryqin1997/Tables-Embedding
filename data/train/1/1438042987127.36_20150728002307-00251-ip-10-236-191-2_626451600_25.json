    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{85395=Despite the multiple video outputs, the outdated\u00a0VGA-output\u00a0is often used at the office. We test it by attaching an external display and the picture quality is good, though close observation reveals a\u00a0slight blur. We also connect the notebook via HDMI: In this case we get a very sharp picture and can choose every resolution from 800x600 up to 1920x1080., 77565=If the numerous ports of the Asus Pro B43V are not sufficient, you can buy a\u00a0docking station: Asus sells the\u00a0Power Station II\u00a0with the part number 90N0LDK1001Y; it is connected to the device via the docking port at the bottom and is available on the Internet\u00a0for around 130 Euros (~$170). A detailed test of the Power Station II can be found in the review of the\u00a0Asus B43E. For around 180 Euros (~$222) you can also find a genuine spare battery\u00a0on the Internet with the part number 07G016H01875., 65731=The measured values support the good first impression: Even if the brightness distribution is slightly more uneven than the competition, none of the other panels can reach the average brightness of 270.9 nits. The black value is also excellent by comparison and results in a comparatively good contrast of 335:1. If you come closer you can recognize a distinct screen-door effect, unfortunately it is hard to capture this effect on a picture.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{165225=The high-energy consumption of the Asus Pro B43V under load is clearly noticeable in the battery runtimes: Even with the\u00a0large 61 Wh battery,\u00a0our review unit fails to stand out from the competition: Only 1:36 hours\u00a0under maximum load. In the more realistic WLAN scenario and DVD playback, the larger battery shows its advantages: Compared to the\u00a0Lenovo ThinkPad T430s\u00a0with similar components but smaller battery our review unit achieves\u00a0considerably longer runtimes. The maximum runtime for the Asus Pro B43V is determined by the Battery Eater Reader\u2019s Test (minimal brightness, wireless connections deactivated, energy-saving mode and activated Intel HD Graphics 4000). In this scenario the review unit achieves 6:36 hours independence from the grid.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Even though the graphics card is not really intended for gaming,\u00a0it is quite capable, at least as long as details and resolution are not too high. The native display resolution of 1600x900 seems to be too much for the graphics card, otherwise most of the games are\u00a0playable in principle. Casual and browser gamers will have no problems with the Asus Pro B43V; a small test of \"The Settlers Online\" was smooth even in an advanced colony.

    "textAfterTable": "Emissions System Noise You can hardly hear the Asus B43V due to the quiet fan and the hard drive that produces no loud noises. The fan is even completely deactivated from time to time, with the energy profile \"Quiet Office\" in particular. In this scenario the Asus B43V is\u00a0pretty much silent. Under load it is only slightly louder with an\u00a0average of 35.8 dB (A)\u00a0produced by the fan. The notebook is only really noticeable when you insert a DVD: If data is read from the DVD it is very audible with\u00a046.3 dB (A), however this is just temporary noise, for the long-term the DVD drive produces 41 dB (A). This is audible but still okay. Noise Level Idle 29.8 / 31.2 / 31.2 dB(A)",
