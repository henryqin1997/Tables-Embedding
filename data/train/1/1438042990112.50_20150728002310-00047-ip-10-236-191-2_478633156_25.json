The cell cycle inhibitor-loaded film containing the radioactive source is then placed in the resection cavity as required., 126091=[0066] Within one preferred embodiment of the invention, the cell cycle inhibitor is paclitaxel, a compound which disrupts mitosis (M-phase) by binding to tubulin to form abnormal mitotic spindles or an analogue or derivative thereof. Briefly, paclitaxel is a highly derivatized diterpenoid (Wani et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93:2325, 1971) which has been obtained from the harvested and dried bark of Taxus brevifolia (Pacific Yew) and Taxomyces Andreanae and Endophytic Fungus of the Pacific Yew (Stierle et al., Science 60:214-216, 1993). \u201cPaclitaxel\u201d (which should be understood herein to include formulations, prodrugs, analogues and derivatives such as, for example, TAXOL\ufffd, TAXOTERE\ufffd, docetaxel, 10-desacetyl analogues of paclitaxel and 3\u2032N-desbenzoyl-3\u2032N-t-butoxy carbonyl analogues of paclitaxel) may be readily prepared utilizing techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., Schiff et al., Nature 277:665-667, 1979; Long and Fairchild, Cancer Research 54:4355-4361, 1994; Ringel and Horwitz, J.

Twenty-five grams of PVA was weighed directly into a 600 ml glass beaker and 500 ml of distilled water was added, along with a 3 inch Teflon coated stir bar. The beaker was covered with glass to decrease evaporation losses, and placed into a 2000 ml glass beaker containing 300 ml of water. The PVA was stirred at 300 rpm at 85\ufffd C. (Coming hot plate/stirrer) for 2 hours or until fully dissolved. Dissolution of the PVA was determined by a visual check of solution clarity. The solution was then transferred to a glass screw top storage container and stored at 4\ufffd C. for a maximum of two months. The solution, however, must be warmed to room temperature before use or dilution., 581579=[0532] For example, 0.1-30% w/w paclitaxel, 0.1-30% w/w docetaxel, 0.1-30% w/w etoposide, 0.1-30% w/w topotecan, 0.1-30% w/w irinotecan, 0.1-30% w/w vinblastine, 0.1-30% w/w vincristine, 0.1-30% w/w vinorelbine, 0.1-30% w/w carboplatin, 0.1-30% w/w cisplatin, 0.1-30% w/w cyclophosphamide, 0.1-30% w/w doxorubicin, 0.1-30% w/w ifosfamide, 0.1-30% w/w methotrexate, 0.1-30% w/w lomustine, 0.1-30% w/w mitomycin, and/or 0.1-30% w/w gemcitabine can be incorporated into silicone, polyurethane and EVA, which is applied as a coating to the radioactive stent. Alternatively, 100 \u03bcg -50 mg paclitaxel, 100 \u03bcg-50mg docetaxel, 100 \u03bcg-50mg etoposide, 100 \u03bcg-50 mg topotecan, 100 \u03bcg-50mg irinotecan, 1 OOpg- 50mg vinblastine, 100 \u03bcg-50 mg vincristine, 100 \u03bcg-50 mg vinorelbine, 100 \u03bcg-50mg carboplatin, 100 \u03bcg-50 mg cisplatin, 100 \u03bcg-50 mg cyclophosphamide, 100 \u03bcg-50 mg doxorubicin, 100 \u03bcg-50 mgifosfamide, 100 \u03bcg-50 mgmethotrexate, 100 \u03bcg-50 mg lomustine, 100 \u03bcg-50 mg mitomycin, and/or 100 \u03bcg-50 mg gemcitabine in a crystalline form can be dried onto the surface of the stent. A polymeric coating may be applied over the cell cycle inhibitor to help control the release of the agent into the surrounding tissue. A third alternative is to incorporate 0.1-30% w/w paclitaxel, 0.1-30% w/w docetaxel, 0.1-30% w/w etoposide, 0.1-30% w/w topotecan, 0.1-30% w/w irinotecan, 0.1-30% w/w vinblastine, 0.1-30% w/w vincristine, 0.1-30% w/w vinorelbine, 0.1-30% w/w carboplatin, 0.1-30% w/w cisplatin, 0.1-30% w/w cyclophosphamide, 0.1-30% w/w doxorubicin, 0.1-30% w/w ifosfamide, 0.1-30 % w/w methotrexate, 0.1-30 % w/w lomustine, 0.1-30% w/w mitomycin, and/or, 377703=[0255] Permanent intracavitary therapy can also be performed as part of implantation of a medical device. Catheters, balloons and stents are often used to open obstructed body cavities. Malignant diseases (e.g., esophageal cancer, colon cancer, biliary cancer) and non-malignant hyperproliferative diseases (e.g., atherosclerosis, restenosis, benign prostatic hypertrophy) are frequently treated in this manner. A catheter is advanced across the obstruction, a balloon is inflated to dilate the passageway and a stent is implanted to physically hold the lumen open.

In this embodiment, compositions and methods are described for delivery of cell cycle inhibitors from catheters and balloons. In another embodiment, the cell cycle inhibitor is applied as coatings for a radioactive stent., 324241=[0187] Within further aspects of the invention, the therapeutic compositions may be formulated for topical application. Representative examples include: ethanol; mixtures of ethanol and glycols (e.g. ethylene glycol or propylene glycol); mixtures of ethanol and isopropyl myristate or ethanol, isopropyl myristate and water (e.g., 55:5:40); mixtures of ethanol and eineol or D-limonene (with or without water); glycols (e.g., ethylene glycol or propylene glycol) and mixtures of glycols such as propylene glycol and water, phosphatidyl glycerol, dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol, Transcutol\ufffd, or terpinolene; mixtures of isopropyl myristate and 1-hexyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-dodecyl-2-piperidinone or 1-hexyl-2-pyrrolidone. Other excipients may also be added to the above, including for example, acids such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, and surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate.

The drug matrix is prepared by dissolving paclitaxel and polyethylene glycol in tetrahydrofuran., 469408=[0379] Although relatively rare, ocular tumors can have devastating clinical consequences. Uveal melanoma (1500 new cases per year in the U.S.) and retinoblastoma (300-350 cases per year in the U.S.; primarily children) often require enucleation (removal of the affected eye) to effectively treat the disease. The object of the local therapies described below is to destroy the tumor and while preserving visual acuity. In addition, the non-malignant hyperproliferative eye disease pterygia can also be treated with these embodiments. Pterygia is the growth of proliferative fibrovascular tissue that originates from the canthus and grows towards the limbus and cornea. The tissue is non-transparent and can cause obstruction of vision. Although it can be treated by surgical excision, recurrence following resection is common. Embodiments of the present invention suitable for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases of the eye include:, 320840=[0182] Other compositions which may be utilized to carry and/or deliver the cell cycle inhibitors described herein include vitamin-based compositions (e.g., based on vitamins A, D, E and/or K, see, e.g., PCT publication Nos. WO 98/30205 and WO 00/71163) and liposomes (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,534,499, 5,683,715, 5,776,485, 5,882,679, 6,143,321, 6,146,659, 6,200,598, and PCT Publication Nos.

Cell Cycle Inhibitor Delivered via Catheter\u2014Numerous drug delivery catheters have been described for the local delivery of pharmacologic agents, e.g., radioactive catheters (EPA 832670, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,938,582, 5,916,143, 5,899,882, 5,891,091, 5,851,171, 5,840,008, 5,816,999, 5,803,895, 5,782,740, 5,720,717, 5,653,683, 5,618,266, 5,540,659, 5,267,960, 5,199,939, 4,998,932, 4,963,128, 4,862,887, 4,588,395, WO 99/42162, WO 99/42149, WO 99/40974, WO 99/40973, WO 99/40972, WO 99/40971, WO 99/40962, WO 99/29370, WO 99/24116, WO 99/22815, WO 98/36790, WO 97/48452) and balloon devices (EPA 904799, EPA 904798, EPA 879614, EPA 858815, EPA 853957, EPA 829271, EPA 325836, EPA 311458, EPB 805703, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,913,813, 5,882,290, 5,879,282, 5,863,285, WO 99/32192, WO 99/15225, WO 99/04856, WO 98/47309, WO 98/39062, WO 97/40889). Here aqueous, nanoparticulate and microparticulate formulations (all described above) can be infised via such a device. The therapy is then delivered via the catheter, the stent or the balloon., 691652=[0673] A cell cycle inhibitor may be administered to a target tissue from a film by placing the film in contact with that tissue. One embodiment in this example is the implantation of an EVA film containing a sufficient amount of paclitaxel (10%) at the site of a breast tumor excision prior to closure of the wound. The film is sutured to maintain its position at the excision site. After implantation of the film, local radiation is administered. A biodegradable film may be substituted for this purpose. A biodegradable film made of a blend poly(glycolic-co-lactic acid) (PLGA) and methoxypolyethylene glycol (MePEG) 350 (or another low molecular weight PEG) may be produced by film casting in the same manner described for EVA films in Example 8. To produce these films, the PLGA and MePEG are substituted for the EVA in the process. The PLGA:MePEG ratio may be altered from 60:40 to 95:5 to optimize the film properties including release kinetics of the cell cycle inhibitor, degradation lifetime of the film and pliability of the film. This formulation has been tested by implantation of a film made of 50:50 PLGA:MePEG containing 1% and 5% of a cell cycle inhibitor (paclitaxel) adjacent to a blood vessel in a rat. The film was pliable and served to deliver paclitaxel to the target site., 518152=[0444] Both interstitial and intracavitary brachytherapy are used in the management of vaginal cancer. Typically 6000 cGy (1000 cGy/day) is administered intravaginally (for a more detailed description see \u201cHyperproliferative Diseases of the Uterus\u201d); the vagina is filled with a vaginal cylinder and a brachytherapy source is inserted (Cs137, Ir192). In more advanced disease intravaginal brachytherapy is supplemented with interstitial brachytherapy (i. e., catheters are inserted percutaneously across the perineum using a perineal template)., 651035=[0627] Examples of human tumor cell lines that can be used for this assay include human melanoma, cervical carcinoma and astrocytoma. These cell lines can be cultured in slide flasks, 60 mm dishes or 100 mm dishes. Asynchronously growing populations are plated out for 24 hours for attachment and growth, after which different concentration-time combinations of the drug may be used, followed by irradiation as appropriate. Mitotic cell accumulations and cellular morphology can be evaluated microscopically, with the fraction of cells cycling being monitored by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) uptake (5 \u03bcM) into DNA, fixation in situ and fluorescence examination of a fluorescein-tagged monoclonal antibody against BrdUrd-substituted DNA. Mitotic indices can be determined by counting 1000 cell samples and determining the proportion of rounded, chromatin-condensed mitotic cells in relation to all cells. Flow cytometry is then undertaken on propidium iodine-stained cells and DNA profiles generated., 398768=[0280] As noted above, the polymer coating can include a cell cycle inhibitor as well. This is accomplished by dissolving the cell cycle inhibitor and polymer in a mass ratio of 1:9 into the compatible solvent. In another method, the cell cycle inhibitor is micronized by milling, a particle size fraction of 10-100 \u03bcm is collected by sieving and this fraction is suspended by stirring for 30 minutes in a 30% polymer solution. Representative examples of cell cycle inhibitors that can be utilized in this regard include taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel and docetaxel), topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., ironotecan and topotecan), vinca alkaloids (e.g., vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine), platinum (e.g., cisplatin and carboplatin), mitomycin, gemcitabine, alkalating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, flouropyrimidine, capecitabine, and 5-FU), anthracylines (e.g., doxorubicin mitoxantrone and epirubicin), nitrogen mustards (e.g., ifosfamide and melphalan), antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate), nitrosoureas (e.g., CCNU, streptozocin, carmustine and lomustine), estramustine, tamoxifen, leucovorin, floxuridine, ethyleneimines (e.g., thiotepa); and tetrazines (e.g., dacarbazine and procarbazine)., 91195=[0063] Briefly, a wide variety of cell cycle inhibitory agents can be utilized, either with or without a carrier (e.g., a polymer or ointment or vector), in order to treat or prevent a hyperproliferative disease. Representative examples of such agents include taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel (discussed in more detail below) and docetaxel) (Schiff et al., Nature 277:665-667, 1979; Long and Fairchild, Cancer Research 54:4355-4361, 1994; Ringel and Horwitz, J. Nat'l Cancer Inst. 83(4):288-291, 1991; Pazdur et al., Cancer Treat. Rev. 19(40): 351-386, 1993), Etanidazole, Nimorazole (B. A. Chabner and D. L. Longo. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy - Principles and Practice. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, New York, 1996, p.554), perfluorochemicals with hyperbaric oxygen, transfusion, erythropoietin, BW12C, nicotinamide, hydralazine, BSO, WR-2721, IudR, DUdR, etanidazole, WR-2721, BSO, mono-substituted keto-aldehyde compounds (L. G. Egyud., 628343=[0593] In a fifth embodiment, a cell cycle inhibitor-coated seed can be utilized. Here the cell cycle inhibitor is coated directly onto the radioactive seed (e.g. I1215 or Pd103) either prior to, or at the time of, implantation into the skin. Once again preferred cell cycle inhibitors include taxanes, alkylating agents, tetrazine, and/or nitrosureas. For example, 0.1-40% w/w paclitaxel or 0.1-40% w/w docetaxel can be incorporated into poly (glycolide), poly (lactide-co-glycolide), poly (glycolide-co-caprolactone), albumin, hyaluronic acid, gelatin, Carbopol, polypropylene, silicone, EVA, polyurethane, and/or polyethylene which are applied as a coating on the brachytherapy seed. Similarly, 0.1-40% w/w 5-FU, 0.1-40% w/w dacarbazine, 0.1-40% w/w carmustine, and/or 0.1-40% w/w lomustine can be incorporated into poly (glycolide), poly (lactide-co-glycolide), poly (glycolide-co-caprolactone), albumin, hyaluronic acid, gelatin, Carbopol, polypropylene, silicone, EVA, polyurethane, and/or polyethylene and coated onto a brachytherapy seed. The cell cycle inhibitor-coated seed is then implanted into the skin via needles or catheters (as described previously) or via specialized applicators., 389279=[0267] 5. Cell Cycle Inhibitor-Coated Radioactive Stents\u2014A variety of radioactive stents have been described previously (see, e.g., EPA 857470, EPA 810004, EPA 722702, EPA 539165, EPA 497495, EPB 433011, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,919,126, 5,873,811, 5,871,437, 5,843,163, 5,840,009, 5,730,698, 5,722,984, 5,674,177, 5,653,736, 5,354,257, 5,213,561, 5,183,455, 5,176,617, 5,059,166, 4,976,680, WO 99/42177, WO 99/39765, WO 99/29354, WO 99/22670, WO 99/03536, WO 99/02195, WO 99/02194 and WO 98/48851). These devices are implanted to treat malignant obstruction of body passageways (e.g., esophageal cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, rectal cancer, lung cancer, colonic cancer) or nonmalignant hyperproliferative obstructions of body passageways (e.g., atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, venous stenosis, restenosis, in-stent restenosis, biliary sclerosis, benign prostatic hypertrophy). Briefly, a catheter is advanced across the obstruction under radiographic or endoscopic guidance. Typically, a balloon is inflated to dilate the obstruction and a stent is deployed (either balloon expanded or self-expanded) to physically hold open the obstructed passageway. Radioactive isotopes, such as P32, Au198, Ir192, Co60, I125 and Pd103, are incorporated into the stent to provide local emission of radiotherapy., 99219=[0065] A number of the above-mentioned cell cycle inhibitors also have a wide variety of analogues and derivatives, including, but not limited to, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, misonidazole, tiripazamine, nitrosourea, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, flurouracil, epirubicin, doxorubicin, vindesine and etoposide.

After a clear solution is formed the polymer solution is added at a rate of 1 ml/min to 100 ml of a stirring solution of 2% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in water. Stirring is maintained at 1000 rpm for 2 hours until microspheres form and solidify. After preparation of the microspheres, the suspension is centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate the microspheres from the PVA solution. The PVA solution is decanted and the microspheres are resuspended in 50 ml water to rinse off any residual PVA. The microspheres are centrifuged again and the water is decanted. The microspheres are allowed to dry in a vacuum oven at ambient temperature and high vacuum for 48 hours., 459492=[0365] Interstitial brachytherapy is the most common form of local radiotherapy employed in the management of bladder or urethral cancer. Permanent interstitial brachytherapy implants (such as I125 seeds, radioactive gold grains, or radioactive radon seeds) are placed directly into the tumor via cystoscope, directly during open surgery, percutaneously inserted via a suprapubic approach, or inserted via the vagina. Temporary (high-dose-rate) brachytherapy implants include radium, cobalt or tantalum needles or iridium wires (typical dose is 14.5-29 \u03bcGy/hr). Temporary interstitial implants are usually placed percutaneously or transvaginally, but can also be placed during open surgery. Interstitial embodiments suitable for the treatment of bladder cancer include:, 319672=[0181] A wide variety of forms may be fashioned by the polymers of the present invention, including for example, rod-shaped devices, pellets, slabs, particulates, micelles, films, molds, sutures, threads, gels, creams, ointments, sprays or capsules (see, e.g., Goodell et al., Am. J. Hosp. Pharm. 43:1454-1461, 1986; Langer et al., \u201cControlled release of macromolecules from polymers\u201d, in Biomedical Polymers, Polymeric Materials and Pharmaceuticals for Biomedical Use, Goldberg, E. P., Nakagim, A. (eds.) Academic Press, pp. 113-137, 1980; Rhine et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 69:265-270, 1980; Brown et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 72:1181-1185, 1983; and Bawa et al., J. Controlled Release 1:259-267, 1985). Therapeutic agents may be linked by occlusion in the matrices of the polymer, bound by covalent linkages, or encapsulated in microcapsules. Within certain preferred embodiments of the invention, therapeutic compositions are provided in non-capsular formulations, such as microspheres (ranging from nanometers to micrometers in size), pastes, threads or sutures of various size, films and sprays., 336310=[0199] in which two or more R groups are \u2014(CH2)m\u2014CH=CH2 and the remaining R groups are H and m is an integer from 4 to 18. Within yet other embodiments, the radioactive and non-radioactive repeating units are in a mole ratio of 1:1 to 1 :10,000., 442994=[0340] Surgical films containing a cell cycle inhibitor and a radioactive source can also be used in the management of prostate tumor resection margins. Ideal polymeric vehicles for surgical films include flexible non-degradable polymers such as polyurethane, EVA, silicone and resorbable polymers such as poly (glycolide), poly (lactide-co- glycolide), poly (glycolide-co-caprolactone), albumin, hyaluronic acid, gelatin, and Carbopol. The surface of the film can be modified to hold I125, Pd103 seeds at regular intervals or to hold radioactive wires (see FIG. 10) for a more detailed description). In a preferred embodiment, the surgical film is loaded with a taxane, topoisomerase inhibitor, vinca alkaloid and/or estramustine. For example, 0.1-40% w/w paclitaxel, 0.1-40 w/w docetaxel, 0.1-40% w/w etoposide,0.1-40% w/w vinblastine, and/or 0.1-40% w/w estramustine is incorporated in to the film. The radioactive seeds or wires are placed in the film and can be sealed in place with either another piece of cell cycle inhibitor-loaded film or molten polymer containing a cell cycle inhibitor (described above) which hardens in place. The cell cycle inhibitor-loaded film containing the radioactive source is then placed in the resection cavity as required., 735003=[0720] To the sampled buffer, 1 ml of dichloromethane was added and the tube mixed for 15 minutes by rotating at room temperature. The tube was then centrifuged to separate the aqueous and organic phases. The aqueous supernatant was removed and discarded and the organic extract was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen at 55\ufffd C. Immediately prior to analysis by HPLC, the dried sample was reconstituted with a 1 ml mixture of 1:1 acetonitrile and water. The sample was then analyzed by HPLC using a Hypersil ODS guard column, a 125 mm\ufffd4 mm ID 5 \u03bcm Hypersil ODS column at 28\ufffd C., a uv detector at 232 nm, and a mobile phase of 55% acetonitrile, 45% water with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The injection volume was 10 \u03bcl and the assay run time was 15 minutes. FIGS. 12 to 15 show in vitro release profiles of paclitaxel from the various test articles., 604790=[0559] The most common form of brachytherapy employed in the treatment of sarcomas is implantation of interstitial radioactive sources during tumor resection surgery. Catheters are threaded through the skin and tumor bed intraoperatively. This allows Ir192 wires to be inserted into the tumor resection bed in the postoperative period (usually 5-7 days after surgery) to deliver a dose of approximately 1000 cGy/day., 678058=[0655] The triblock copolymer was prepared by ring opening polymerization of a 1:1 mixture of caprolactone and DL-lactide (the monomer) in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4600 (the initiator). The ratio of monomer to initiator was 70:30. Stated in terms of components, the weight ratio was 35:35:30 caprolactone:DL-lactide:PEG 4600. The polymerization reaction proceeded at 140\ufffd C. for 6 hours with the addition of 0.5% stannous octoate as a catalyst. The formulation can be altered by the addition of varying amounts of paclitaxel, in the range of 0.1 to 5% w/w., 711287=[0701] To produce the microspheres 100 ml of the aqueous phase (PVA solution) was transferred to a 200 ml beaker. In order to control the size of microspheres, the PVA solution was diluted to a final concentration between 1 and 5% PVA in water (see Table 4A). The aqueous phase was stirred using an overhead stirrer. The stirrer setting was selected based on the desired particle size (see Table 4A). To the stirring aqueous phase, i10 ml of polymer solution containing cell cycle inhibitor was added over a period of 1 to 2 minutes. After 3 minutes the stir speed was adjusted (see Table 4), and the solution stirred for an additional 2.5 hours. The stirring blade was then removed from the microsphere preparation, and rinsed with 10 ml of distilled water so that the rinse solution drained into the microsphere preparation. The microsphere preparation was then poured into a 500 ml beaker, and the beaker washed with 70 ml of distilled water which was also allowed to drain into the microsphere preparation. The 180 ml microsphere preparation was then stirred with a glass rod, and equal amounts were poured into four polypropylene 50 ml centrifuge tubes. The tubes were then capped, and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm. Forty-five milliliters of the PVA solution was drawn off of each microsphere pellet., 735907=[0721]FIGS. 12A and 12B show in vitro profiles of paclitaxel release from radiation seed spacers. Each spacer weighs 5-10 mg and contains 1 or 10% w/w paclitaxel in a polymeric matrix containing poly(E-caprolactone) (PCL) and diblock (80:20 MePEG 750:PCL)., 373456=[0249] As noted above, the polymer coating can include a cell cycle inhibitor as well. This is accomplished by dissolving the cell cycle inhibitor and polymer in a mass ratio of 1:9 into the compatible solvent. In another method, the cell cycle inhibitor is micronized by milling, a particle size fraction of 10-100 \u03bcm is collected by sieving and this fraction is suspended by stirring for 30 minutes in a 30% polymer solution. Representative examples of cell cycle inhibitors that can be utilized in this regard include taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel and docetaxel), topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., ironotecan and topotecan), vinca alkaloids (e.g., vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine), platinum (e.g., cisplatin and carboplatin), mitomycin, gemcitabine, alkalating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, flouropyrimidine, capecitabine, and 5-FU), anthracylines (e.g., doxorubicin mitoxantrone and epirubicin), nitrogen mustards (e.g., ifosfamide and melphalan), antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate), nitrosoureas (e.g., CCNU, streptozocin, carmustine and lomustine), estramustine, tamoxifen, leucovorin, floxuridine, ethyleneimines (e.g., thiotepa); and tetrazines (e.g., dacarbazine and procarbazine)., 747465=[0738] The fibre can be drug loaded (e.g., with paclitaxel) by pre-treating the polymer as follows. The polymer and paclitaxel are dissolved in dichloromethane in a weight ratio of 9:1 polymer to paclitaxel. The solvent is removed from the mixture by drying under vacuum to constant weight at 40\ufffd C. A dry matrix has less then a 1% change in weight in three consecutive measurements of mass after 6 hours of drying time., 696844=[0681] Control polyblend spacers were made in the same manner as for composition #1 with the following exception. Prior to heating to 65\ufffd C., PCL was combined with a diblock copolymer having a composition of 20% w/w MePEG 750 and 80% w/w PCL (total molecular weight=3750 g/mol). The PCL and diblock copolymer was combined in weight ratios of 1:3 and 3:1 to produce 25/75 and 75/25 polyblend spacers, respectively., 743213=[0733] Bipyridine-diol is combined with methacryloyl chloride in a mole ratio of 1:1 dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane. The mixture is transferred to a round bottom flask and heated to reflux. A substitution reaction is allowed to proceed for 2-3 hours. The result is a (bipyridine-diol) methacrylate of the type shown in FIG. 1., 303187=[0169] Additional Cell Cycle Inhibitors useful in the present invention, as well as a discussion of their mechanisms of action, may be found in Hardman J.

The surface of the film can be modified to hold I125, Pd103 seeds at regular intervals (see FIG. 9 for a more detailed description). In a preferred embodiment, the surgical film is loaded with a taxane, anthracycline, alkylating agent, antimetabolite, vinca alkaloid, platinum, nitrogen mustard, gemcitabine and/or mitomycin-C. For example, 0.1-40% w/w paclitaxel, 0.1-40 w/w docetaxel, 0.1-40% w/w doxorubicin, 0.1-40% w/w epirubicin, 0.1-40% w/w mitoxantrone, 0.1-40% w/w cyclophosphamide, 0.1-40% w/w 5-FU, 0.1-40% w/w capecitabine, 0.1-40% w/w methotrexate, 0.1-40% w/w vinorelbine, 0.1-40% w/w vinblastine, 0.1-40% w/w vincristine, 0.1-40% w/w carboplatinum, 0.1-40% w/w, cisplatin, 0.1-40% w/w gemcitabine, 0.1-40% w/w mitomycin-C, 0.1-40% w/w ifosfamide, and/or 0.1-40% w/w melphalan is incorporated in to the film. The radioactive seeds or wires are placed in the film and can be sealed in place with either another piece of cell cycle inhibitor-loaded film or molten polymer containing a cell cycle inhibitor (described above) which hardens in place. The cell cycle inhibitor-loaded film containing the radioactive source is then placed in the resection cavity as required., 313621=[0177] Polymers can be fashioned in a variety of forms, with desired release characteristics and/or with specific desired properties. For example, polymers can be fashioned to release a therapeutic agent upon exposure to a specific triggering event such as pH (see, e.g., Heller et al., \u201cChemically Self-Regulated Drug Delivery Systems,\u201d in Polymers in Medicine III, Elsevier Science Publishers B.

The surface of the film can be modified to hold I125 or Pd103 seeds at regular intervals or to hold radioactive wires (see FIG. 9 for a more detailed description). In a preferred embodiment, the surgical film is loaded with a taxane, vinca alkaloid, antimetabolite, platinum and/or alkylating agent.

The radioactive seeds or wires are placed in the film and can be sealed in place with either another piece of cell cycle inhibitor-loaded film or molten polymer containing a cell cycle inhibitor (described above) which hardens in place. The cell cycle inhibitor-loaded film containing the radioactive source is then placed in the resection cavity as required., 315529=[0178] Likewise, polymers can be fashioned which are temperature sensitive (see, e.g., Chen et al., \u201cNovel Hydrogels of a Temperature-Sensitive Pluronic Grafted to a Bioadhesive Polyacrylic Acid Backbone for Vaginal Drug Delivery,\u201d in Proceed.

Nos. 5,789,245, 5,814,482, 5,843,723, and 6,015,686), adeno-associated virus-based system (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,221,646, 6,180,613, 6,165,781, 6,156,303, 6,153,436, 6,093,570, 6,040,183, 5,989,540, 5,856,152, and 5,587,308) and adenovirus-based systems (e.g., U.S. Pat.

Nos. 5,928,913, 5,501,979, 5,830,727, 5,661,033, 4,996,152 and 5,965,441) and, \u201cnaked DNA\u201d based systems (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,859 and 5,910,488) (all of which are, as noted above, incorporated by reference in their entirety)., 744610=[0735] The (bipyridine-diol) methacrylate (FIG. 1) is polymerised with methylmethacrylate to form a poly(methylmethacrylate-co-(bipyridine-diol)methacrylate) as follows. Methylmethacrylate and (bipyridine-diol)methacrylate are combined in a mole ratio of 1:10, dissolved 15% in dry toluene with 1% VAZO67 and degassed by bubbling UHP N2 through the solution. After degassing the reaction vessel is sealed and heated to 65\ufffd C. for 18 hours. After 18 hours, the reaction solution is transferred to lOx the volume of methanol (25\ufffd C.) to precipitate the polymer. The polymer is dissolved in dichloromethane (10% w/v) with excess radioactive 103PdCl4 and refluxed for 36 hours. The polymer is then precipitated in lOx the volume of methanol (25\ufffd C.). The solid product is dried to constant weight at 25\ufffd C. under high vacuum. The product is a radioactive polymer having a structure shown in FIG. 2., 728030=[0709] Poly(DL-lactide)-block-methoxypolyethylene glycol (PDLLA-block-MePEG) with a MePEG molecular weight of 2000 and a PDLLA:MePEG weight ratio 40:60 is used as the micellar carrier for the solubilization of hydrophobic cell cycle inhibitor, such as paclitaxel. PDLLA-MePEG 2000-40/60 (polymer) is an amphiphilic diblock copolymer that dissolves in aqueous solutions to form micelles with a hydrophobic PDLLA core and hydrophilic MePEG shell. The cell cycle inhibitor is physically trapped in the hydrophobic PDLLA core to achieve the solubilization., 569602=[0512] Surgical films containing a cell cycle inhibitor and a radioactive source can also be used in the management of liver and bile duct tumor resection margins. Ideal polymeric vehicles for surgical films include flexible non-degradable polymers such as polyurethane, EVA silicone and resorbable polymers such as poly (glycolide), poly (lactide-co-glycolide), poly (glycolide-co-caprolactone), albumin, hyaluronic acid, gelatin, and/or Carbopol. The surface of the film can be modified to hold I125, Pd103 seeds at regular intervals or to hold radioactive wires (see FIG. 10 for a more detailed description). In a preferred embodiment, the surgical film is loaded with a taxanes, anthracylines, platinum, alkylating agents, gemcitabine, mitomycin, and/or floxuridine (FUDR). For example, 0.1-40% w/w paclitaxel, 0.1-40 w/w docetaxel, 0.1-40% w/w adriamycin, 0.1-40% w/w doxorubicin, 0.1-40% w/w epirubicin, 0.1-40% w/w cisplatin, 0.1-40% w/w 5-FU, 0.1-40% w/w mitomycin, and/or 0.1-40% w/w FUDR is incorporated in to the film. The radioactive seeds or wires are placed in the film and can be sealed in place with either another piece of cell cycle inhibitor-loaded film or molten polymer containing a cell cycle inhibitor (described above) which hardens in place. The cell cycle inhibitor-loaded film containing the radioactive source is then placed in the resection cavity as required., 33013=[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/865,195, filed May 24, 2001, which application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/712,047, filed Nov. 13, 2000, which application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/165,259, filed Nov. 12, 1999, all of which applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety., 304312=[0170] Numerous polypeptides, proteins and peptides, as well as nucleic acids that encode such proteins, can also be used therapeutically as cell cycle inhibitors. This is accomplished by delivery by a suitable vector or gene delivery vehicle which encodes a cell cycle inhibitor (Walther & Stein, Drugs 60(2):249-71, Aug 2000; Kim et al., Archives of Pharmacal Res. 24(1):1-15, Feb 2001; and Anwer et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 17(4):377-424, 2000. Genes encoding proteins that modulate cell cycle include the INK4 family of genes (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,889,169; 6,033,847), ARF-pl9 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,313), p21 and p27 (WO 9513375; WO 9835022), p27 KIP1 (WO 9738091), p57KIP2 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,025,480), ATM/ATR (WO 99/04266), Gadd 45 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,679), Mytl (U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,349), Weel (WO 9949061) smad 3 and smad 4 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,032), 14-3-3\u03c3 (WO 9931240), GSK3\u03b2 (Stambolic, V. and Woodgett, J. R., Biochem Journal 303: 701-704, 1994), HDAC-1 (Furukawa, Y. et al., Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 73: 130-133, 1996; Taunton, J. et al., Science 272: 408-411, 1996), PTEN (WO 9902704), p53 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,532,220), p33ING1 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,986,078), Retinoblastoma (EPO 390530), and NF-1 (WO 9200387)., 422243=[0313] As noted above, the polymer coating can include a cell cycle inhibitor as well. This is accomplished by dissolving the cell cycle inhibitor and polymer in a mass ratio of 1:9 into the compatible solvent. In another method, the cell cycle inhibitor is micronized by milling, a particle size fraction of 10-100 \u03bcm is collected by sieving and this fraction is suspended by stirring for 30 minutes in a 30% polymer solution. Representative examples of cell cycle inhibitors that can be utilized in this regard include taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel and docetaxel), topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., ironotecan and topotecan), vinca alkaloids (e.g., vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine), platinum (e.g., cisplatin and carboplatin), mitomycin, gemcitabine, alkalating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, flouropyrimidine, capecitabine, and 5-FU), anthracylines (e.g., doxorubicin mitoxantrone and epirubicin), nitrogen mustards (e.g., ifosfamide and melphalan), antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate), nitrosoureas (e.g., CCNU, streptozocin, carmustine and lomustine), estramustine, tamoxifen, leucovorin, floxuridine, ethyleneimines (e.g., thiotepa); and tetrazines (e.g., dacarbazine and procarbazine)., 540537=[0481] In a fourth embodiment, a cycle inhibitor is loaded into a resorbable [(e.g., poly (glycolide), poly (lactide-co-glycolide), poly (glycolide-co-caprolactone), albumin, byaluronic acid, gelatin, and/or Carbopol)] or nonresorbable [(e.g., polypropylene, silicone, EVA, polyurethane, and/or polyethylene] polymer(s) and formed into a cylindrical spacer 1-5 mm in diameter and 0.5 cm or 1.0 cm in length. 1125 or Pdl seeds are placed in a needle (or catheter) and separated from each other by the cell cycle inhibitor-loaded spacers (i.e., seed-spacer-seed-spacer, etc.) of the appropriate length. The needles or catheters are then inserted through a template and into the hyperproliferative tissue in the uterus. Under general or spinal anesthesia, a template is placed over the perineum (e.g. Syed-Neblett Template, Martinez Universal Perineal Interstitial Template) and needles/catheters are inserted under ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance until the tumorous uterine tissue is implanted with needles 0.5 to 1.0 cm apart. Although any cell cycle inhibitor could be incorporated into a polymeric spacer, taxanes, platinum, alkylating agents, nitrogen mustards, topoisomerase inhibitors, anthracyclines and/or estramustines are preferred. For example, 0.1-40% w/w paclitaxel (by weight) incorporated into a resorbable or non-resorbable polymeric spacer is an ideal embodiment. Docetaxel at 0.1-40% w/w, 0.1-40% w/w cisplatin, 0.1-40% w/w 5-Fluorouracil, 0.1-40% w/w ifosfamide, 0.1-40% w/w irinotecan, 0.1-40% w/w doxorubicin, and/or 0.1-40% w/w gemcitabine are also preferred embodiments., 306971=[0172] Within one aspect of the invention, ribozymes or antisense sequences (as well as gene therapy vehicles which can deliver such sequences) can be utilized as cell cycle inhibitors. One representative example of such inhibitors is disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 00/32765 (which, as noted above, is incorporated by reference in its entirety)., 327329=[0190] Other carriers that may likewise be utilized to contain and deliver the therapeutic agents described herein include: hydroxypropyl \u03b2-cyclodextrin (Cserhati and Hollo, Int.

Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims. [0754] One hundred grams of polyethylene pellets are mixed with 1 g tungsten powder (Aldrich, 12 micron). The mixture is then extruded in the form of a rod with a diameter of approx 0.83 mm. The extruded rod is then cut into pieces of approx. 5.5 mm. Non-Degradable Spacer With Metallic Particles Example 35 [0753] A polyethylene rod of diameter 0.83 mm is prepared by an extrusion method. A 20% w/v solution of a polyurethane (ChronoFlex) in THF is prepared. Tungsten powder (Aldrich, 12 micron) is added to the polyurethane solution. The solution is stirred until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. The amount of tungsten powder added is adjusted such that a uniform polymer/tungsten powder coating is obtained when the polymer rod is dipped into the solution. The coated rod is then placed in a forced-air oven to remove the solvent. Optionally the coated rod can be dipped into a second polyurethane/THF solution such that a polyurethane coating is added over the polyurethane/tungsten powder coating. The solvent is removed using a forced-air oven (50\ufffd).",
