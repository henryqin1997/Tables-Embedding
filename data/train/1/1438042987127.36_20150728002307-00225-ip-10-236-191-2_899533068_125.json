            "Great and fun really a good way to meet people. Greek life can get a little high school at times with organizations aiming to get rival org in trouble with university guidelines.",
            "Plenty of options available.",
            "Hispanics",
            "Super affordable as far as courses. Food is a little pricy and the bookstore is a for-profit business so prices are a little on the high end.",
            "Depends on your general view of fun, however I constantly hear good things from all differnet types of people.",
            "A pretty good amount of options available at the university and plenty more right across the street.",
            "did not live there",
            "I found courses relatively easy. Time management is key make sure to apply yourself and youll get the A.",
            "Apply to the excellence scholarship program here at the university. Get involved it does not matter if you got UTPA or UT Austin you will have the same experience if you just go to class and go home. Don\u00c2?t expect the university to do it for you explore your options and opportunities",
            "Dont think I would have had nearly as many opportunities at another university as I have here. Diversity is a little low but it is a commuter school in a Hispanic region of the state of Texas. Very affordable and much to do but social life is dependent on your ability to meet new people which I would imagine is the same in every university"

The campus is expanding in many ways including its parking.

The faculty are very helpful and do their best to help make my time here effortless. However, the paperwork to apply for admission has been total confusion from the start and I felt that I was getting nowhere for quite some time.}",

Security is all around campus, and there are Emergency buttons almost at every corner. Clubs and Activities UTPA offers different activities including; Women's Soccer, Men's Soccer, Flag Football, Co-ed Kickball, Softball, Baseball, etc. Great for these types of students",
