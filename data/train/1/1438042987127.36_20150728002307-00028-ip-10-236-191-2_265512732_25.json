Cal Fire uses 23 Grumman S2T \"Turbine Tankers.\" Initially 23 of these aircraft were obtained by the U.S. Forest Service from the military as surplus. The Forest Service retained ownership and leased the planes to Cal Fire. The state replaced all 23 of these aircraft with newly built planes between 2002 and 2005 and now have ownership. Their capacity is 1200 gallons of retardant and are highly maneuverable. They are unique in that they are new aircraft built as airtankers, are owned by a state and are not used planes with a history of military use., 11292=The NIFC Radio Cache is the largest in the world consisting of 8,000 handheld radios, 200 repeaters, and 15 portable satellite systems, containing about 10,000 pieces of equipment worth $26 million. This equipment can support about 32,000 firefighters or 53 major disasters at one time. This cache is maintained and used primarily for wildland fire, however, it may show up on any federally supported large incident or disaster such as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, law enforcement and large special events (it was used in 2004 for both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions). It is located and maintained by the National Interagency Incident Communications Division (NIICD) of the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) in Boise, Idaho. The NIICD Communications Duty Officer (CDO) is the nationwide incident frequency coordinator for this cache and issues authorizations based on potential interference with nearby incidents and other agencies. The CDO coordinates aviation (VHF AM) frequency use with the FAA, the sole agency responsible for the use of aviation frequencies., 29506=(2) Command Channels 8-12 are in the Federal Interoperability Channel Plan as NC1 and IR1-IR4. See the NTIA Federal Incident Response Channel Plan for more information. These channels are listed in the 2014 California FIRESCOPE communications plan. There is a single verified report of one of these frequency pairs being used on an incident outside of California. This would indicate these commands are available for use outside of California., 29360=(1) The authorization for Command 7 was withdrawn in 2011. Authorization has not been issued for a replacement pair of frequencies., 71625=--Information per FAA directive dated November, 2012 and posted on the NIFC website.--}",

Starting in 2014 per the National Incident Radio Support Cache User\u2019s Guide \"New for 2014\" on page 2, incidents are advised to program CTCSS tones in all VHF repeaters (command) and all tactical frequencies. The communications duty officer (CDO) assigns the tones on an incident by incident basis. All frequencies listed are narrowband FM (FMN). It is possible that P25 digital mode may be used in some areas. According to this Interagency Aviation Tech Bulletin dated February, 2008 all aviation FM radios are required to be P25 capable.
