Frequency distribution of values for international dioxin toxic equivalent (I-TEq) content of breast milk samples from Germany, 1995-98, 271 determinations, fitted normal distribution, 218575=In an accident at a BASF plant producing trichlorophenol in Ludwigshafen, Germany, in 1953, a total of 247 employees (243 men, 4 women) were identified as having been involved directly or in subsequent clean-up, repair or maintenance activities (Zober et al., 1990; Ott & Zober, 1996). Measurements of TCDD in serum were available for 138 of these persons (Ott et al., 1993). The geometric mean concentration was 15 pg/g (range, < 1\u2013550 pg/g). The cumulative dose of TCDD at the time of exposure was calculated from a model for each person. The mean concentrations were 38 pg/g for a subgroup with no chloracne, 420 pg/g for a subgroup with moderate chloracne and 1000\u00a0pg/g for a group with severe chloracne. The cohort was observed for deaths and cancer incidence until 1992, and the rate of mortality from cancer was found to increase with increasing exposure (Figure 9). Mortality rates from cancers of the digestive system and respiratory tract also tended to increase with increasing exposure. Similar results were obtained for cancer incidence. A joint analysis of dose of TCDD and cigarette smoking showed a relationship between the dose and the occurrence of all cancers combined among current cigarette smokers but not among non-smokers., 442094=Canada 1981, 429978=The WHO Regional Office for Europe initiated a series of international studies on the concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in human milk. The first round of studies took place in 1987\u201388, and the health risks of infants were re-assessed at a consultation in 1988 on the basis of the results. As the measured intakes found were the first to have been reported for many years and for many countries, the consultation recommended that the studies be repeated at 5-year intervals, in order to define the trends in intake. The second round of studies was performed in 1993, involving 19 countries in which samples could be collected and analytical data produced by the agreed deadline. Table 21 summarizes the results (WHO, 1996). Collection of samples for the third round began in 2000, the bulk of the samples being collected in 2001., 485431=Canada: Canada provided data on dioxin toxic equivalents in over 400 human milk samples collected across the country in 1986\u201387 (Ryan et al., 1993b). Of these, 100 samples, selected by province according to population, were analysed for PCDDs/PCDFs. The results showed the presence of 11 analytes with 2,3,7,8 substitution. The mean value for the country was about 15 pg/g of lipid. The data from the second round of the WHO-coordinated study showed a range of 11\u201329 pg/g of lipid and significant differences between the provinces. Additionally, in human milk collected in 1997 from residents of northern Canada (Keewatin), the mean content of PCDD/PCDF toxic equivalents was 4.9\u00a0pg/g of lipid, and that of non-ortho PCB toxic equivalents was 1.7 pg/g of lipid (Newsome & Ryan, 1999)., 886709=Mocarelli, P., Marocchi, A., Brambilla, P., Gerthoux, P.M., Young, D.S. & Mantel, N.

Frequency distribution of values for international dioxin toxic equivalent (I-TEq) content of breast milk samples from Germany, 1995-98, 271 determinations, fitted log-normal distribution, 223298=The mortality rates of 1189 male workers were investigated through 1992 (Flesch-Janys et al., 1995, 1996). The concentrations of various PCDD and PCDF congeners were measured in adipose tissue or whole blood from 190 workers, and the values for each worker at the end of exposure were calculated on the basis of a one-compartment first-order kinetics model. The mean estimated concentration of TCDD for the whole cohort was 140 ng/kg of lipid (median, 38 ng/kg). In some departments, workers had been exposed to other carcinogens, such as dimethyl sulfate and benzene. The mortality rate from all cancers was increased in all categories of exposure to TCDD and showed a significant trend (p = 0.01) with increasing intensity of exposure (Figure 10). No data were reported on deaths from cancers at specific sites., 212880=2479 male workers employed in four German plants; Boehringer cohort included women, 349166=Belgium: Belgium submitted information about the occurrence of dioxins in pooled milk and cheese samples, using the GEMS/Food electronic submission format.

Chemosphere, 37, 1723\u20131730., 637954=Until recently, researchers assumed that clearance of TCDD and its relatives was (or could be approximated by) a simple first-order process of the familiar kind. In this method, the change in concentration over time is used to estimate a half-life for depuration (i.e., the time required to reduce the concentration by half), from which a rate constant can be calculated. The model is not consistent with several observations, however, most notably measurements of clearance rates at high doses in the Yusho and Yu-Cheng rice oil poisoning incidents. It is also not consistent with the observation that background concentrations of dioxin are excreted both unchanged and as an oxidized metabolite (not identified in humans) (Wendling et al., 1990) Excretion unchanged is a diffusion-limited process, while excretion of a metabolite is probably a first-order reaction (assuming that oxidation is rate-limiting); however, the data suggest that considering these two processes as one does not introduce a large error. These observations show that, for body burdens > 1000 ng/kg bw, the initial depuration half-life is about 1 year, while those based on measure-ments of blood concentrations nearer to the background level are about 10\u00a0years. Back-calculation of the initial doses received in the Yusho and Yu-Cheng incidents from concentrations measured many years later results in underestimates of the actual doses by about an order of magnitude. Carrier et al. (1995a,b), Andersen and co-workers (Leung et al., 1990a,b) and Zeilmaker and van Eijkeren (1997, 1998; Zeilmaker et al., 1999) have shown that more complex models are required to account for the clearance rates of high doses. They have explained this discrepancy as a function of variable storage of dioxins in proteins induced in the liver. Depuration from this store is much more rapid than that from lipid stores, and, in addition, induction oxidase enzymes may further speed clearance., 879846=Malisch, R.

Assoc., 259, 2715\u20132719., 39071=During the past few decades, heavy exposure to dioxins and furans has occurred in isolated incidents of contamination or release. Well-studied examples of environmental releases include the exposure of the local population at Seveso, Italy (Pocchiari et al., 1979; Bertazzi & di Domenico, 1994), and from fires in PCB-filled electrical equipment, such as in the Binghamton State Office Building in New York State, USA (Fitzgerald et al., 1986, 1989). Heavy exposure, with toxic effects, has also been caused by contaminated foods. Known examples are the contamination of edible oils, such as in the Yusho (Japan) and Yu-cheng (Taiwan) food poisoning episodes (Rogan et al., 1988; Kuratsune et al., 1996; see section 2.3.2), which involved exposure to concentrations of dioxin or furan at least three to four orders of magnitude higher than the highest normally found in foods., 135963=Sister chromatid exchange and micronuclei were found in human lymphocytes treated with TCDD, in the absence or presence of alpha-naphthoflavone (Nagayama et al., 1993, 1994)., 906249=Rylander, L., Stromberg, U. & Hagmar, L.

In addition, comprehensive evaluations have been conducted by several organizations, including IARC (1997), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (1998) in the USA, the European Union (1999, 2000a,b,c) and the Environmental Protection Agency (2000a) in the USA., 924029=Weisglas-Kuperus, N., Patandin, S., Berbers, G.A.M., Sas, T.C.J., Mulder, P.G.H., Sauer, P.J.J. & Hooijkaas, H.

Cancer Res., 51, 1391\u20131397., 683143=1300, 1400, 673933=In its draft document on the health effects of dioxin, the Environmental Protection Agency in the USA applied a linear model to data for the same three cohorts to predict the lifetime risk for cancer. This analysis differed from that conducted by the Committee in three main ways. First, rather than using the data of Steenland et\u00a0al. (1999, 2001), they used data from Fingerhut et al. (1991), which covered the same cohort but included five fewer years of follow-up and a less detailed assessment of exposure. Secondly, the Environmental Protection Agency used average body burden as the exposure metric, whereas the Committee used cumulative serum concentration. Thirdly, the Environmental Protection Agency assumed a baseline SMR of 100, whereas the Committee allowed the baseline SMR to increase above 100 because the hypothesis that SMR =100 could be rejected. The Environmental Protection Agency did not report on the fit of their model to the data. On the basis of their meta-analysis, they estimated an ED01 of 47 ng/kg of lipid and 95% lower bound of 30 ng/kg. If the same assumptions as made above (human body, 25% lipid, 50% uptake of TCDD toxic equivalents, and half-life of 7.6 years), this lipid concentration corresponds to a daily intake of 5.9 pg/kg bw per day (95% lower bound, 3.7 pg/kg bw per day)., 680986=Table 38. Concentrations of dioxin-like contaminants in oil produced on 5 February 1968 in the Yusho incident (ng/g of oil), 467541=The concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs were not increasing. In fact, those in some countries tended to decrease, and dramatic decreases, by up to 50%, were seen in some countries in comparison with the 1987 study. The situation was less clear for PCBs, as different, and sometimes less reliable, analytical methods were used in many countries in the first of the two studies., 628838=As discussed above, a NOEL was identified for effects in male rat offspring; thus, no factor for conversion from a NOEL to a LOEL was needed for the EHMI derived from the study of Ohsako et al. (2001). As concluded at the 1998 WHO consultation (van Leeuwen & Younes, 2000), use of body burdens to scale doses from animal studies to equivalent human levels removes the need for safety factors for differences in toxicokinetics between animals and humans. A safety factor must be applied, however, to account for interindividual differences in toxicokinetics among humans. Only limited data were available on the toxicokinetics of TCDD in humans, and it was considered that the default factor of 3.2 (WHO, 1994) was appropriate., 350145=New Zealand: New Zealand submitted the results of analyses for 53 foods purchased in 1997 in five cities. The foods were grouped into 22 composites and analysed to determine the concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs and 23 PCB congeners including non-ortho PCBs., 493377=Finland: The dioxin concentrations in this population, who frequently eat fish from the Baltic Sea, are comparable to those seen in inhabitants of Seveso, Italy, after the accidental release of TCDD in 1976. High concentrations of international toxic equivalents were observed in frequent fish eaters (median, 170 pg/g of lipid; mean, 180; range, 51\u2013420; n = 26). The value for men in Finland (median, 32 pg/g of lipid; mean, 33; range, 12\u201381; n = 45) was considered to be the normal concentration for men aged 40\u201370 years (Kiviranta et al., 2000)., 115680=Groups of six male and six female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated by gavage with total doses of 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF of 0, 18, 220, 1300, 4000 or 6000 \u00b5g/kg bw for females and 0, 31, 370, 2200, 6700 or 10\u00a0000 \u00b5g/kg bw for males over 13 weeks; the total dose was divided into four daily loading doses, each comprising about 13% of the total dose, and was followed by six maintenance doses given every 2 weeks, each equivalent to 7.8% of the total dose. Treatment induced a variety of biochemical and toxic effects similar to those seen with TCDD in a group of rats given a total dose of 42\u00a0\u00b5g/kg bw for females and 70 \u00b5g/kg bw for males by the same dosing regimen. On the basis of the measured end-points (deaths, hepatic EROD induction, decreased plasma T4 concentration, haematological indices), the TEF for this congener was estimated to be 0.007, in close agreement with the WHO-assigned TEF of 0.01 (Viluksela et al., 1997)., 475802=1998, 26339=Two documents were particularly important in this evaluation. A WHO consultation held in 1998 (van Leeuwen & Younes, 2000) established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 1\u20134 pg/kg bw, which was applied to the toxic equivalents of PCDDs, PCDFs and coplanar PCBs. The TDI was based on the results of a number of studies of developmental toxicity, in which pregnant rats were given TCDD by gavage, and immunological toxicity. The present Committee used this assessment as the starting point for its evaluation, taking into account newer studies that provided information on:, 851615=Grubbs, W.D., Lustik, M.B., Brockman, A.S., Henderson, S.C., Burnett, F.R., Land, R.G., Osborn, D.J., Rocconi, V.K., Schrieber, M.E., Williams, D.E., Wolfe, W.H., Michalek, J.E., Miner, J.C., Henriksen, G.L. & Swaby, J.A.

Natl Cancer Inst., 84, 1648\u20131653., 270289=Increased concentrations of D-glucaric acid were found in adults and children in Seveso in 1976 (Ideo et al., 1985). By 1981, however, the concentrations were within the normal range. No increases were found in US Air Force personnel in Viet Nam (Roegner et al., 1991)., 907931=Schecter, A., P\u00e4pke, O., Ball, M. & Ryan, J.

Chemosphere, 23, 1913\u20131919., 680465=The intakes of oil were converted to estimates of PCDF intake on the basis of analyses made of the oil at the time of the incident (Morita et al., 1977; Miyata et al., 1985; Tanabe et al., 1989; Yao et al., 2002). The results are shown in Table 38. The toxic equivalents value of the oil was estimated to be 792 ng/g of oil. As rice-bran oil is reported (Masuda, 1992) to have a density of 0.92 kg/l, the oil produced on 5\u00a0February 1968 can be estimated to have contained 730 ng toxic equivalents per ml., 220423=Becher et al. (1996) reported on the mortality rates among 2479 male workers employed in four German plants involved in the production of phenoxy herbicides and chlorophenols or who were likely to have been in contact with these substances and with their contaminants, PCDDs (often including TCDD) and PCDFs. The study did not include the persons involved in the BASF accident. It included workers from a Boehringer-Ingelheim plant in Hamburg, for whom results have been reported in several publications (Manz et al., 1991; Nagel et al., 1994; Flesch-Janys et al., 1995, 1996). The concentrations of TCDD were measured in the blood of workers in three of the four plants (Kogevinas et al., 1997). The mortality rate was increased in the whole cohort from all cancers combined (138 deaths; standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0\u20131.4), cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx (nine deaths; SMR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4\u20135.6), lung cancer (47 deaths; SMR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1\u20131.9), lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms (13 deaths; SMR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9\u20132.9) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (six deaths; SMR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2\u20137.1)., 140885=Groups of 10\u201312 female B6C3F1 mice were treated by gavage with various dioxin, furan and PCB congeners once every 3 weeks for five dosing periods to assess the survival of autotransplanted endometrial lesions. The doses used were 0, 1, 3 and 10 \u00b5g/kg bw for TCDD; 0, 3 and 30 mg/kg bw for 2,2\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5,5\u00b4-HxCB; 0, 100, 300 and 1000 \u00b5g/kg bw for 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB; 0, 10, 30 and 100 \u00b5g/kg bw for 2,3,4,7,8-PCDF; and 0, 2 and 20\u00a0mg/kg bw for 1,3,6,8-TCDD. Endometrial tissue was transplanted during the second dosing period. Hepatic EROD activity was induced in a dose-dependent manner at the two highest doses of TCDD and at all doses of 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB and PCDF. The diameter of the endometrial lesions was significantly increased only at 1 and 3 \u00b5g/kg bw of TCDD and 100 \u00b5g/kg bw of PCDF. Whereas the weights of the lesions appeared to decrease with increasing dose of TCDD, the weights were still higher than those of controls. No significant effects were seen on ovarian or uterine horn weights, but the thymus weights were decreased and the liver weights increased at the two higher doses of PCDF. Examination of ovarian tissue showed the absence of active corpora lutea and increased numbers of regressive corpora lutea in mice at 10 \u00b5g/kg bw TCDD and 100 and 1000 \u00b5g/kg bw 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB (Johnson et al., 1997). In a study of similar experimental design with TCDD only, a dose of 10 \u00b5g/kg bw significantly increased the diameter of the endometriotic site in female Sprague-Dawley rats, and doses of 3 and 10 \u00b5g/kg bw decreased the ovarian weight by 15% and 27%, respectively (Cummings et al., 1996)., 154488=Various structural end-points associated with the developing urogenital system of rodents have been shown to be extremely sensitive to perturbation by TCDD and coplanar chemicals. In males in particular, indices of delayed puberty (rats and hamsters), reductions in prostate growth and development (rats and mice), decreased epididymal and cauda epididymal weights (rats), decreased testicular and epididymal sperm numbers (rats, mice, hamsters) and decreased numbers of ejaculated sperm (rats and hamsters) have been observed (Roman & Peterson, 1998). In certain strains of rat (Holtzman and Long Evans), TCDD given as single doses as low as 0.05\u20130.064\u00a0\u00b5g/kg by gavage on day 15 of gestation has been associated with reduced ventral prostate weights and reduced epididymal and ejaculated sperm counts (Mably et al., 1992a,b,c; Gray et al., 1995, 1997a,b)., 485046=Brazil: The concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs were determined in a pooled sample of breast milk from 40 mothers, 33 at their first lactation and seven at their second (age, 15\u201338 years), living in the urban area of Rio de Janeiro county in 1992. The dioxin content was 8.1 pg/g of lipid expressed as international toxic equivalents (Paumgartten et al., 2000)., 848905=Geusau, A., Tschachler, E., Meixner, M., Sandermann, S., P\u00e4pke, O., Wolf, C., Valic, E., Stingl, G. & McLachlan, M.

The mean concentration of PCDDs/PCDFs international toxic equivalents in milk was 17 pg/g of lipid (or 20 pg/g of lipid expressed as WHO toxic equivalents), with a range of 6.5\u201334 (7.8\u201341) (Fr\u00e9ry et al., 2000)., 501540=1996, 862792=Ilsen, A., Briet, J.M., Koppe, J.G., Pluim, H.J. & Oosting, J.

Most of the long-term experiments designed to determine the toxicity of dioxin and coplanar chemicals were conducted with various rodent species or non-human primates. The carcinogenic effects assessed in long-term studies are summarized in Table 4., 164178=Female offspring from the study of Gray et al. (1997a) were isolated after weaning and followed for sexual development until postnatal day 70. Additional females were mated to control males on postnatal day 100 for assessment of fertility. On postnatal day 70, the age of onset of vaginal opening was delayed in pups of dams at 0.8 \u00b5g/kg bw by approximately 2 days when compared with controls, and pups of dams at 0.2 and 0.8 \u00b5g/kg bw had decreased distance between urethral and vaginal openings (by 40% at the highest dose). After mating on postnatal day 100, no significant differences were seen in treated animals with respect to fertility, but the time to pregnancy of offspring of dams at the highest dose was increased by three estrous cycles when compared with controls (4.1 days and 14.4 days, respectively). Significantly increased numbers of female offspring at 0.2 and 0.8 \u00b5g/kg bw had urogenital anomalies (vaginal thread, cleft phallus). For example, 92% of females at the highest dose and 2.5% of controls had permanent vaginal threads. A cross-fostering experiment with the group at 1 \u00b5g/kg bw indicated that exposure in utero was necessary for the induction of vaginal and external genitalia anomalies. Cleft phallus and changes in the urethral opening position have also been observed in rats given other estrogen-like chemicals (diethylstilbestrol, RU 2858, estradiol) (Gray et al., 1997b)., 256823=An initial report from Seveso indicated that the sex ratio of children born to parents who had lived in zone A, with the highest level of TCDD contamination, was altered in favour of females (Mocarelli et al., 1996). Of the births that occurred from 9 months after the accident to 7 years later, about twice as many children were female (26 males, 48 females). In nine highly exposed families (maternal and paternal serum TCDD concentrations > 100 pg/g of lipid), no male children were born (0 males, 9\u00a0females). During 1985\u201394, the sex ratio apparently reverted to normal (60 males, 64 females). In a follow-up study (Mocarelli et al., 2000), evidence was reported that a paternal serum concentration of TCDD > 80 pg/g of lipid and a body burden of 16\u201320 ng/kg bw was a significant predictor of a female birth. The most extreme modification of the sex ratio was observed among fathers who had been exposed when they were < 19 years of age (sex ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.30\u20130.47). A biological explanation of this phenomenon has not yet been provided. General decreases in the normal male:female sex ratio of 1.06:1.0 have been observed in a number of industrialized countries since 1950 but not to the extent temporarily observed in Seveso (Davis et al., 1998)., 215669=The incidence of and mortality from cancer were investigated in the population of Seveso that was exposed during the industrial accident in 1976. The contaminated area was subdivided into three zones (zone A, zone B and zone R), according to the average concentration of TCDD measured in soil samples. The concentrations in serum in 1976 in 19 non-randomly selected persons from zone A ranged from 830\u00a0pg/g to 56 000 pg/g, and the geometric mean serum concentrations measured 20 years after the accident (Landi et al., 1997) were 53 pg/g in seven randomly selected residents of zone A (the most heavily contaminated zone), 11 pg/g in 55\u00a0persons in zone B (the second most heavily contaminated zone) and 4.9 pg/g in 59 persons in the uncontaminated area (zone non-ABR). The populations of 11\u00a0municipalities surrounding the contaminated area were used as a reference (zone\u00a0R)., 906856=Saracci, R., Kogevinas, M., Bertazzi, P.A., Bueno de Mesquita, B.H., Coggon, D., Green, L.M., Kauppinen, T., L\u2019Abb\u00e9, K.A., Littorin, M., Lynge, E., Mathews, J.D., Neuberger, M., Osman, J., Pearce, N. & Winkelmann, R.

In all countries in which a substantial number of samples had been analysed, the concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs and coplanar PCBs in food were decreasing up to the late 1990s, but this decrease had slowed or was even partly reversed in some food categories in several countries owing to contamination of animal feed. For the present assessment of intake at the international level, only data collected after 1995 were considered., 506101=USA: The most extensive study of the body burdens of PCDDs/PCDFs is the National Human Adipose Tissue Survey (Environmental Protection Agency, 2000b), which involved analysis of 48 samples composited from 865 samples collected in 1987 from autopsied cadavers and patients undergoing surgery. The mean for all the samples was 28 pg/g of lipid expressed as international toxic equivalents or 33 pg/g of lipid expressed as WHO toxic equivalents. The tissue concentrations of international toxic equivalents were found to increase with age (0\u201314 years, 9.7 pg/g of lipid; 15\u201344 years 25 pg/g of lipid; > 45 years, 46 pg/g of lipid). In general, the average tissue concentrations were fairly uniform geographically. No significant difference was found on the basis of race or between males and females., 902517=Roegner, R.H., Grubbs, W.D., Lustik, M.B., Brockman, A.S., Henderson, S.C., Williams, D.E., Wolfe, W.H., Michalek, J.E. & Miner, J.C.

Serum dioxin analysis of 1987 examination results (NTIS No. AD A-237-516 through AD A-237-524)., 238943=This review does not cover studies of phenoxy acetic acid herbicide applicators, including US Air Force personnel who applied Agent Orange, numerous community based case\u2013control studies on soft-tissue sarcoma, malignant lymphoma and other neoplasms, and studies of persons exposed to unspecified combinations of pesticides and herbicides or to herbicides not contaminated by PCDDs (e.g. Axelson et al., 1980; Hardell et al., 1981; Blair et al., 1983; Coggon et al., 1986; Michalek et al., 1990; Coggon et al., 1991; Lynge, 1993). The available information indicates that, in these studies, the concentrations of TCDD were lower and, in most cases, considerably lower than that to which industrial workers and the population of Seveso were exposed. In one Swedish case\u2013control study (Nygren et al., 1986), the mean serum concentration was 2 pg/g in 13 exposed persons and 3 pg/g in 18 unexposed persons. In a study of the most heavily exposed commercial sprayers in New Zealand (Smith et al., 1992), the concentration of TCDD was near the background level in serum of sprayers with 5\u201310 years of experience. A higher mean concentration of TCDD (53 pg/g) was found for sprayers who had first been employed before 1960 and with a mean duration of spraying 2,4,5-trichlorphenoxyacetic acid of 16 years. Lower values were observed among commercial sprayers in Australia (Johnson et al., 1992) and in US Air Force personnel who had sprayed phenoxyacetic acid herbicides in Viet Nam (Ketchum et al., 1999), the latter being near background., 92699=Short-term intake by rats of diets containing TCDD (14\u20131000 ng/kg bw per day), 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB (0.47\u201310 \u00b5g/kg bw per day), 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-HxCB (81\u2013730 \u00b5g/kg bw per day) or 2,2\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5,5\u00b4-HxCB (0.7\u20136 mg/kg bw per day) maximally induced a twofold increase in hepatic porphyrin concentration (lowest effect doses: TCDD, 47\u00a0ng/kg bw per day; 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB, 3.2 \u00b5g/kg bw per day; 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-HxCB, 360 mg/kg bw per day). Concomitant administration of TCDD and 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB or 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-HxCB resulted in an additional twofold increase in porphyrin concentration. When these compounds were administered with a non-inducing dose of TCDD (33 ng/kg bw per day), however, an 800-fold increase in accumulation of porphyrins was seen, in particular uroporphyrin III and heptacarboxylic porphyrin, in the liver, indicating a strong synergistic action. Furthermore, induced acetanilide 4-hydroxylase activity correlated well with induction of accumulation of porphyrins in the liver. The mechanism behind these effects consisted of CYP 1A2-mediated oxidation of uroporphyrinogen III to uroporphyrin III and induction of the activity of delta-aminolaevulinic acid synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme in haem biosynthesis, by 2,2\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5,5\u00b4-HxCB (van Birgelen et al., 1996a)., 885168=Michalek, J.E., Wolfe, W.H. & Miner, J.C.

To explore the potential quantitative range of cancer risks suggested by these studies, a meta-analysis was conducted by the Committee of the combined data on all cancers from the epidemiological studies for which appropriate data were available. Three such studies were identified: the study of German pesticide and herbicide workers by Flesch-Janys (1998), the study by Ott & Zober (1996) of German workers whose exposure resulted from an industrial accident and the updated follow-up by Steenland et\u00a0 al.

(1990), estimated the mean intake of the group to be 2400 ng/kg bw; however, this estimate is based on a disposition model with no assumption of extra storage of PCDF in the liver and is thus an underestimate of the dose by a factor of about 5. After adjustment for hepatic storage, the estimate is 10\u00a0000\u00a0ng/kg bw. All these values are within the bounds of experimental uncertainty, with a mean of 10\u00a0000 ng/kg bw. Thus, the Committee assigned an ED50 for severe chloracne or Yusho syndrome of 10\u00a0000 \u00b1 2000 ng/kg bw. This is also the approximate ingested dose at which essentially all persons would have been expected to develop chloracne.

All mice were observed for 35 days before necropsy. Significant mortality occurred in groups of the Ahb/b strain given doses >\u00a0200\u00a0\u00b5g/kg bw, 100% of animals at the two higher doses dying by about 21 days after dosing; an LD50 value of 160 \u00b5g/kg bw was estimated by probit analysis. Conversely, few deaths were seen in the Ahd/d strain, only 33% of those at the high dose dying; an LD50 value of 3400 \u00b5g/kg bw was estimated. Decreased body-weight gain, increased liver weight and thymic and splenic atrophy were observed in both strains of mice (Birnbaum et al., 1990)., 718471=> 2000, 367207=Derived from the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey 1998 (Voedingscentrum, 1998) with regression analysis and nested analysis of variance (Slob, 1993).

The concentrations of PCB toxic equivalents in 1993 were 10\u201312 ng/kg of milk fat, giving a total of 31\u201334 ng/kg milk fat for dioxins and PCBs. PCBs were not determined in 1987\u201388 (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, 1997)., 696646=Hayabuchi et al. (1979) reported the estimated intakes and intake rates for six persons who were believed to have ingested the smallest amounts of contaminated oil and the six who ingested it at the lowest rate. Of these, five were men, three were women and four were children. The results are shown in Table 40. (As two of the 12\u00a0children were under 5 years of age, the estimates of their intake were considered insuffuciently accurate.) Four men and one girl had severe symptoms (clinical grades 3 and 4). The intake estimates indicate a LOEL of toxic equivalets for severe chloracne in adults of 3000 ng/kg bw. The intakes of the five patients (three women, one man and one girl) with mild symptoms (grades 0\u20132) were estimated to have been 4000\u20137000\u00a0ng/kg bw. Ryan et al.

(1972) and Hayabuchi et al. (1979). These authors studied a group of 146 persons who claimed to have ingested contaminated rice-bran oil produced on 1 day (5 February 1968) and sold in 13.5-l cans. They estimated the amount of contaminated oil ingested by the patients and reported the proportions of patients with various symptoms. In the first paper, they describe chloracne, subdiving the cohort into three classes of intake of oil (< 720 ml, 720\u20131440 ml, > 1440 ml). In the second, they reported that the smallest and largest total intakes had been 220 ml and 3375 ml, respectively. Thus, the classes of intake can be set at 220\u2013720 ml, 720\u20131440 ml and 1440\u20133375 ml. The group with low intake comprised 80 persons, 58 of whom (78%) had symptoms of chloracne. The person with the lowest total intake had severe chloracne. All 45\u00a0patients with intermediate intake and all 21 with high intake developed chloracne. On the basis of a graphical interpolation in semi-log space, the ED50 for chloracne due to ingestion of oil in the Yusho incident was estimated to be 74\u2013220 ml., 261789=In a study of 418 mother\u2013infant pairs enrolled in 1990\u201392, 209 infants were to be breastfed for at least 6 weeks and 209 infants were to be fed exclusively with formula. The median total toxic equivalents in the breast milk was 63 ng/kg of lipid (range, 25\u2013160 ng/kg). The physical and neurological developmental of the infants was assessed from 2 weeks after birth to the present (42 months completed). Previous findings had indicated that prenatal exposure to dioxins and PCBs was associated with lower birth weight and reduced infant growth up to the age of 3\u00a0months, subtle alterations in thyroid hormone concentrations and immunological parameters and poorer neurological condition at 18 months of age (Cuijpers et al., 1997; Patandin et al., 1998, 1999; Boersma et al., 2000). The childrens\u2019 intellectual functioning was assessed with the Dutch version of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children up to 42 months of age. Although higher PCB concentrations in maternal plasma (>\u00a03.0 \u00b5g/l) were associated with lower cognitive scores in the entire cohort and in the formula-fed group, no effects on performance were seen of prenatal or lactational exposure (Patandin et al., 1999). All the scores for cognitive ability were within the range of those of the normal population. The immunological status of the children was also assessed at 42 months of age by administering a health questionnaire, measuring plasma antibodies and conducting lymphocyte marker analyses (Weisglas-Kuperus et al., 2000). The contributions of mono-ortho (14 ng/kg of lipid) and planar PCBs (15\u00a0ng/kg of lipid) toxic equivalents in breast milk were associated with a 10\u201317% higher incidence of recurrent (> six episodes) middle-ear infections, while the toxic equivalent of dioxin (36 ng/kg of lipid) was associated with a slightly (6%) higher prevalence of coughing, chest congestion or phlegm lasting for 10 or more days. There was no association between antibody titres, leukocyte counts and immunological markers and dioxin and/or PCB toxic equivalents., 616574=The studies reviewed included those evaluated by IPCS in 1998 (Mably et al., 1992a,b,c; Rier et al., 1993; Gehrs et al., 1997; Gray et al., 1997a,b; Gehrs & Smailowicz, 1998) and two further studies (Faqi et al., 1998; Ohsako et al., 2001a,b). The most sensitive adverse effects reported were on development in male rat offspring and immunological deficits after prenatal exposure to TCDD (Table 33)., 137161=TCDD did not bind to mouse liver DNA (Turteltaub et al., 1990), but it induced DNA single-strand breaks in the liver and in peritoneal lavage cells in rats (Wahba et al., 1988, 1989; Alsharif et al., 1994)., 197286=The effects on the thyroid observed in experimental animals after exposure to dioxins or coplanar chemicals usually involve decreases in free and total T4 in serum, with no compensatory effects on TSH or T3 (Brucker-Davis, 1998). Dose-dependent decreases in plasma T4 concentration were observed in groups of eight female Sprague-Dawley rats given diets supplemented with TCDD at a concentration of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 5 or 20 \u00b5g/kg for 13 weeks, with estimated daily intakes of 0, 14, 26, 47, 320 and 1000 ng/kg bw per day. The concentration of total T4 in plasma was significantly reduced at doses > 47 ng/kg bw per day (van Birgelen et al., 1995b). Similar effects were observed in groups of eight female rats of the same strain given diets containing 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB at a concentration of 0, 7, 50 or 180 \u00b5g/kg for 13\u00a0weeks, providing daily intakes of 0, 0.47, 3.2 and 10 \u00b5g/kg bw per day. The lowest dose of 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB that induced a significant decrease in free or total T4 in plasma was 3.2 \u00b5g/kg bw per day. The LOEL was 0.047 \u00b5g/kg bw per day (van Birgelen et al., 1995a)., 849929=Graham, M., Hileman, R., Orth, G., Wendling, J.M. & Wilson, J.D.

The cohort comprised 16\u00a0863 men and 1527 women who had been employed in production or spraying, distributed among 20 cohorts in 10 countries. The cohort was updated and expanded with the data of Fingerhut et al. (1991) and Becher et al. (1996) (Kogevinas et al., 1997). The length of follow-up differed by plant, but workers at most of the European plants were followed through 1991\u201392, and those in the USA through 1987. Current concentrations of TCDD were measured in 574 workers in 10 plants in seven countries ranged from 3 to 390 ng/kg of lipid. This study represents the largest cohort of TCDD-exposed workers and includes groups with heavy exposure to TCDD and cohorts with little or very little exposure. Among the workers who had been exposed to TCDD or higher chlorinated PCDDs, the mortality rate was increased for soft-tissue sarcoma (six deaths; SMR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.8\u20134.4), and the rates of mortality from all cancers combined (710 deaths; SMR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0\u20131.2), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (24 deaths; SMR, 1.3; 0.9\u20132.1) and lung cancer (225 deaths; SMR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0\u20131.3) were slightly elevated. The risks for all cancers combined and for soft-tissue sarcomas and lymphomas increased with time since first exposure. In a direct comparison of persons exposed to higher chlorinated PCDDs and those exposed to lower chlorinated PCDDs or none, the rate ratio for all cancers combined was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0\u20131.8). Increased risks were found for breast cancer in both women and men, endometrial cancer and testicular cancer (Table 6). The increased mortality rate from breast cancer was confined to female workers in the Boehringer plant in Germany (nine deaths; SMR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3\u20135.4). Two of three deaths from endometrial cancer similarly occurred among women who had worked in this plant. An excess risk was also seen for cancer of \u2018other endocrine organs\u2019, both deaths being from tumours of the suprarenal glands., 887197=Mocarelli, P., Gerthoux, P.M., Ferrari, E., Patterson, D.G., Jr, Kieszak, S., Brambilla, P., Vincoli, N., Signorini, S., Tramacere, P., Carreri, V., Sampson, E.J., Turner, W.E. & Needham, L.L.

A mean intake of 688 ml was reported (Hayabuchi et al., 1979). Subjective and clinical symptoms in 46 persons who had undergone physical examinations in 1970 and had responded to a questionnaire were related to a different subdivision of intake: < 499 ml, 500\u2013999 ml and > 1000 ml. Three symptoms were found to show a dose\u2013response relationship: central nervous system symptoms (headache and dizziness), peripheral neuropathy and numbness of the limbs, and abnormalities of the teeth. Using simple log-linear interpolation, the Committee inferred ED50 values for the last two effects of 625 ml and 875 ml, respectively. As more than half the patients with the lowest intake had symptoms of central nervous system involvement, a reliable ED50 for this response could not be estimated. In addition, all these persons also had ocular discharge. \u2018Latent\u2019 intakes were reported for a few patients; the term is not clearly defined but appears to mean the amount estimated to have been ingested before medical attention was sought. The lowest reported latent intake was 121 ml and the highest was 1925 ml (Yoshimura & Hayabuchi, 1985)., 263914=In a study designed to investigate the causes of enamel defects in teeth, children born in Finland in 1987 underwent dental examinations at the age of 6\u20137 years and were classified according to the extent of changes in mineralization in their teeth. Although the duration of breastfeeding and breast milk toxic equivalents at 4 weeks of age (mean, 49 pg/g of lipid) were not associated with the changes in teeth mineralization, exposure to dioxin or furan toxic equivalents was associated with these changes (Alaluusua et al., 1996, 1999). In a related study, 202 children in a PCB contaminated area of Slovenia underwent a dental examination to assess developmental defects of the enamel (Jan & Vrbi, 2000). The tooth dentine of these children had more than five times more PCB than that of children in a control group (38 and 7 ng/g, respectively). On the basis of an analysis of maternal serum and milk samples and representative foods from the same region, the children were estimated to have been exposed to toxic equivalents at a rate of 39 pg/kg bw per day. About twice as many exposed children as controls were found to have permanent teeth with enamel defects on the labial surface (22% and 13%, respectively)., 846701=Food Standards Agency (2000) Dioxins and PCBs in the UK diet: 1997 total diet study samples (Food Surveillance Information Sheet No. 4/00), London.

In the former group, current serum concentrations of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone and testicular abnormalities, sperm count, sperm abnormalities and testicular volume were not associated with current or back-extrapolated serum TCDD concentrations (Henriksen et al., 1996). In 1987, the median serum TCDD concentration in this group was 13 pg/g of lipid (up to 620 pg/g) (Roegner et al., 1991). However, in the more heavily exposed group of herbicide production workers, linear regression analysis indicated that serum TCDD concentrations > 20 pg/g of lipid (upper quartile, 244\u20133400 pg/g) were positively associated with high serum concentrations of luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones and negatively associated with a low serum concentration of testosterone (Egeland et al., 1994)., 81730=Dietary administration of TCDD (14\u20131024 ng/kg bw per day), 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB (0.47\u201310.1 \u00b5g/kg bw per day), or 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-HxCB (81\u2013729 \u00b5g/kg bw per day) to Sprague-Dawley rats clearly induced EROD activity.

The 95% CIs for the NOELs were 0.35\u20130.89 for TCDD-induced EROD activity and 0.55\u20133.8 ng/kg bw per day for that of acetanilide 4-hydroxylase (van Birgelen et al., 1995a)., 931084=Zober, A., Messerer, P. & Huber, P.

Between 1986 and 1998, 1732 samples were collected from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bayern (Bavaria), Nordrhein-Westfalen and Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony) and the Federal Health Institute (Table 24). These data confirm a decrease from about 30 pg/g of lipid in 1990 to about 12\u00a0pg/g of lipid in 1998., 89512=Decreased plasma T4 levels were found after exposure of rats to phenobarbital, 3-methylchlolanthrene or the PCB mixture Aroclor 1254. This decrease correlated well with increased T4 UGT activity (Barter & Klaassen, 1992). Furthermore, PCBs and phenobarbital caused increased biliary clearance of T4 (Bastomsky, 1974; McClain et al., 1989; Beetstra et al., 1991). Short-term dietary intake of TCDD (14\u20131000 ng/kg bw per day) by rats lowered the concentrations of total T4 and free T4 in plasma at doses > 47 ng/kg bw per day. No effect was found on total triiodothyronine (T3) (van Birgelen et al., 1995b). Furthermore, short-term dietary intake of TCDD (14\u20131000 ng/kg bw per day), 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB (0.47\u201310 \u00b5g/kg bw per day) or 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-HxCB (81\u2013730 \u00b5g/kg bw per day) resulted in dose-dependen increases in the activity of hepatic UGT 1A1, T4 UGT and CYP 1A1 and concomitant decreases in free and total T4 in plasma. Total T4 in plasma and hepatic T4 UGT activity were negativily correlated, whereas UGT 1A1 and CYP 1A1 activities were positivily correlated. This suggests involvement of the Ah receptor in inducing hepatic T4 glucuroni-dation and, consequently, in modulating thyroid hormone metabolism (van Birgelen et al., 1994a,b, 1995a)., 888808=Nagayama, J., Nagayama, M., Iida, T., Hirakawa, H., Matsueda, T. & Masuda, Y.

The average concentration of toxic equivalents (calculated according to WHO TEFs from 1998, including dioxins and furans) was 20 pg/g of lipid.

It was assumed that values for the missing PCBs would increase the estimate of PCB concentrations by another 3.3 pg/g of lipid, for a total value for PCB toxic equivalents of 5.3 pg/g of lipid and a total WHO toxic equivalent value (dioxins, furans and coplanar PCBs) of 25 pg/g of lipid.

The induction was potentiated by concomitant administration of 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-HxCB and 2,2\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5,5\u00b4-HxCB, whereas no such potentiation was found with 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5,5\u00b4-HxCB, 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD, 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD, or 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF (De Jongh et al., 1993).

Most of the reduction was accounted for by the amount in fat liberated from the patties during cooking. There was nevertheless an overall deficit of 6\u201314% for each congener (Petroske et al., 1997, 1998). The authors attributed the losses to volatility, degradation and processing, but errors due to analytical imprecision or loss of fat were not considered. The general physical characteristics of these compounds would suggest that volatility and degradation are unlikely reasons for loss during cooking or broiling. Nevertheless, pan frying of ground beef significantly reduces the amounts of PCDD/PCDFs as consumed, provided that the fats and juices are not eaten., 683914=750, 1360, 222631=The rate of mortality from all cancers combined among men was increased in comparison with the rate for the general population (93 deaths; SMR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0\u20131.5).

However, these PCB congeners appear to have relatively little toxicity. On the basis of the available toxicological information, the non-ortho PCBs 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4-TCB, 3,4,4\u00b4,5-TCB, 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB and 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5,5\u00b4-HxCB and the mono-ortho congeners 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4-PeCB, 2,3,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB, 2,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB, 2\u00b4,3,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB, 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-HxCB, 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5\u00b4-HxCB, 2,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5,5\u00b4-HxCB and 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5,5\u00b4-HpCB were assigned TEFs by a WHO expert group in 1997 and are therefore analysed to determine their PCB toxic equivalent. Data on these coplanar PCB congeners are still scarce. As non-ortho PCBs occur in a much lower range of concentrations, mono-ortho and non-ortho PCBs must be determined separately. Reliable determinations of non-ortho PCBs in food have been performed by high-resolution MS, as demonstrated in interlaboratory studies., 109304=In studies of the porphyrinogenic potential of various chlorinated dioxins, furans and coplanar PCBs, groups of five female B6C3F1 mice were treated on 5 days per week for 13 weeks by gavage with concentrations related by TEFs to doses of TCDD of 0, 0.15, 0.45, 1.5, 4.5, 15, 45, 150 or 450 ng/kg bw per day: 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD, TEF, 0.05; 2,3,7,8-tetrabromodibenzo-para-dioxin, TEF, 0.15; 2,3,7,8-TCDF, TEF, 0.3; 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF, TEF, 0.05; 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, TEF, 0.5; OCDF, TEF, 0.003; 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4-PeCB, TEF, 0.00001; 2,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB, TEF, 5 x 10\u20136; 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-HxCB, TEF, 0.0001; 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB, TEF, 0.03. Analysis of hepatic tissue for highly carboxylated porphyrins and CYP 1A1 and 1A2 induction indicated that the binding affinity of the congeners to the Ah receptor in vivo was related to CYP 1A2 induction, which was in turn correlated to hepatic porphyrin accumulation. The LOELs associated with significant increases in total hepatic porphyrin content were: 15 ng/kg bw per day for TCDF; 45 ng/kg bw per day for TCDD; 300 ng/kg bw per day for PeCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB, 900 ng/kg bw per day for tetrabromodibenzo-para-dioxin and 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF; 45 \u00b5g/kg bw per day for OCDF; 1500 \u00b5g/kg bw per day for 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-HxCB; 7500 \u00b5g/kg bw per day for 2,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB; and 13\u00a0000 \u00b5g/kg bw per day for 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4-PeCB. Induction of hepatic porphyrins by the mono-ortho-substituted PCBs was greater than that estimated from the TEFs assigned to them, which was considered to be related in part to non-Ah receptor-dependent induction of CYP 2B1 and delta-aminolaevulinic acid synthetase (van Birgelen et al., 1996b)., 812906=Behnisch, P.A., Allen, R., Anderson, J., Brouwer, A., Brown, D.J., Campbell, T.C., Guoyens, L., Harrison, R.O., Hoogenboom, R., van Overmeire, I. & Malisch, R.

Carcinogenesis, 16, 1705\u20131710., 42503=In contrast to TCDD and 2,3,7,8-TCDF, OCDD is poorly absorbed, 2\u201315% of a single dose being absorbed after administration by gavage in a 1:1 ortho-dichlorobenzene:corn oil mixture (Birnbaum & Couture, 1988; Couture et al., 1988). Furthermore, the absorption of a single oral dose of 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD was found to vary from 19 to 71% (Wacker et al., 1986)., 227427=A study of workers in 12 plants in the USA was designed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Fingerhut et al., 1990, 1991; Steenland et al., 1999). The cohort comprised 5172 men and included most workers in the USA likely to have been exposed to TCDD during manufacture principally of trichlorophenol and 2,4,5-trichlorphenoxyacetic acid. The average concentration of TCDD in serum from 253 workers at two plants in 1987 was 230 ng/kg of lipid, whereas that in 79 unexposed workers was 7 ng/kg. The concentration increased to 420 ng/kg in serum from 119 workers who had been exposed for more than 1 year. Extrapolation to the date at which these workers had been employed, assuming a half-life of 7.1 years, indicated a mean serum concentration at that time of 2000 ng/kg of lipid (highest concentration, 32\u00a0000\u00a0ng/kg). In the latest update, of mortality rates through 1993 (Steenland et al., 1999), the cohort was restricted to 3538 workers from eight plants for whom a detailed occupational history was available. An exposure matrix was used to estimate the degree of exposure to TCDD in the whole cohort. The SMR for all cancers combined was 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0\u20131.2). A statistically significant, positive, linear trend in risk for all cancers combined and for lung cancer was found with increasing exposure (Figure 12). The SMR for all cancers combined for the group with the heaviest exposure was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2\u20131.8). The excess cancer risk was limited to the workers with the heaviest exposure, which was likely to have been 100\u20131000 times higher than that experienced by the general population and similar to the doses of TCDD used in studies in experimental animals., 695661=The largest dose received by the Yusho patients studied by Hayabuchi et al. (1979), 3375 ml, is equal to 45\u00a0000 ng toxic equivalents per kg bw; the largest dose reported to have been received during the \u2018latent period\u2019 (before presentation to a physician), 1934 ml, is equal to ~ 24\u00a0000 ng/kg bw. (These two intakes may or may not refer to the same individual.) Geusau et al. (1999) reported blood lipid concentrations of TCDD in two women who were taken to hospital with chloracne of 144\u00a0000 and 26\u00a0000\u00a0ng/kg of lipid, implying ingested doses of > 100\u00a0000 and 20\u00a0000\u00a0ng/kg bw, respectively. The larger dose is somewhat uncertain, as the toxicokinetics models used to infer body burden from serum lipid concentrations has not been tested for lipid concentrations > 20 \u00b5g/kg. It is assumed in the model that the distribution among compartments does not change markedly at very high doses, which may not be correct., 832980=Davis, D.L., Gottlieb, M.B. & Stampnitzky, J.R., (1998) Reduced sex ratio of male to female births in several industrial countries.

When combined with data on residues in matrices such as tissue, soil and water, TEFs allow determination of the toxic equivalents concentration of the residue. For a particular residue containing a mixture of i PCDDs, j PCDFs and k PCBs, the toxic equivalence is calculated according to the following equation:, 233184=1367, 438004=Maritimes 1992, 309646=Hoogenboom et al. (2000, 2001) reported that the CALUX has been validated in their laboratory for milk fat and citrus pulp pellets to monitor adherence to limits of 5\u00a0pg/g of lipid and 500 pg/kg of product, respectively, as toxic equivalents. The results for other animal and plant fats were comparable to those for milk fat, and those for feed ingredients (with the exception of kaolinitic clay) were similar to the results for citrus pulp. The CALUX method is sensitive not only to dioxins but also to other Ah-receptor agonists, possibly resulting in \u2018false-positive\u2019 results. This potential problem was partly overcome by use of selective clean-up procedures (such as acid silica) and long exposure of the cells (24 h). However, as the possibility of \u2018false-negative\u2019 results appears to be negligible, the method was considered ideal for screening samples with no dioxins and samples suspected of containing dioxins and requiring further investigation by the GC\u2013MS reference method., 505200=New Zealand: New Zealand provided a press release that stated that the concentrations of dioxin in breast milk had fallen by about two-thirds during the past decade. The Environmental Protection Agency (2000a) in the USA reported a concentration of 21 pg/g of lipid for New Zealand in 1994, expressed as WHO toxic equivalents., 65848=The first physiologically based pharmacokinetics models of dioxin-like compounds (2,3,7,8-TCDF, King et al., 1983; TCDD, Leung et al., 1988) allowed for only linear kinetics, i.e. they described the accumulation of dioxin-like compound in the body as a process which depends linearly on the administered dose. However, these models could not describe the hepatic sequestration of dioxin-like compounds, in particular the binding of TCDD to induced hepatic CYP 1A2. This deficiency was overcome by introducing Ah receptor-dependent CYP induction and subsequent binding of TCDD to induced CYP 1A2 in the model. The latter model was found to describe well the non-linear kinetics of TCDD, as observed in rodents exposed to TCDD at doses that induce Ah receptor-dependent CYP proteins in the liver (Leung et al., 1990a,b; Andersen et al, 1993; Kohn et al., 1993, 1994, 1996; Andersen et al, 1997a,b; Wang et al., 1997a,b; Zeilmaker & van Eijkeren, 1997)., 250854=While there was clear evidence that dioxins and coplanar chemicals can cause a variety of adverse reproductive effects in experimental animals, the evidence for human populations was limited, except for the two episodes of rice oil poisoning in South-East Asia. Accidental consumption of rice oil contaminated with heat-degraded PCBs occurred in two separate episodes, in Japan in 1968 and in Taiwan (Province of China) in 1979. These incidents are referred to as \u2018Yusho\u2019 and \u2018Yu-cheng\u2019, which mean \u2018oil poisoning\u2019 in Japanese and Chinese, respectively. Large numbers of persons were exposed. In the Yusho incident, the average intake of the rice oil contaminated with PCBs, PCDFs and polychlorinated quaterphenyls was estimated to have been 150 ng/kg bw per day (as toxic equivalents), which is five orders of magnitude higher than the reported average background intake in several countries. Analysis of the rice oils in question showed that other chlorinated compounds, including polychlorinated terphenyls, naphthalenes, quarterphenyls and furans, were present, in addition to the PCBs Chen et al., 1985; Masuda et al., 1985)., 349431=Canada: Canada submitted the results of a total diet study conducted between 1992 and 1995 on dioxins and PCBs in 220 composite foods collected in five cities. All the results submitted were for individual samples. Data from older studies conducted between 1980 and 1989 were also submitted but were excluded from the international intake assessment., 811359=Bastomsky, C.H.

Endocrinology, 95, 1150., 607081=1000, 44785=As in blood, the distribution of dioxins and furans between serum and organs is determined by lipid partitioning and protein binding. The concentrations of dioxins and furans in blood and adipose tissue correlate well (P\u00e4pke et al., 1989; Iida et al., 1999a). TCDD is distributed between plasma/blood and adipose tissue by lipid partitioning (Patterson et al., 1988; Gochfeld et al., 1989). However, in the case of HeCDD/HeCDF and OCDD/OCDF, the distribution between plasma and adipose tissue is determined by both lipid partitioning and plasma protein binding (Patterson et al., 1989; Schecter et al., 1991, 1998)., 168278=Pregnant Syrian hamsters, about 4 months old, were given a single dose of TCDD at 0 (n = 9) or 2 \u00b5g/kg bw (n = 10) on day 11.5 of gestation by gavage. The dose reflected the higher LD50 seen with this species than with rats (1200 \u00b5g/kg bw and 20\u00a0\u00b5g/kg bw, respectively). After parturition and lactation, the female offspring were monitored for various developmental landmarks until maturity (postnatal day 152\u2013166). Although TCDD treatment had no effect on the body-weight gain or litter size of dams, pup body weights were reduced by up to 30% by the end of lactation, and the reduction persisted until postnatal day 140. Eye opening was accelerated by about 1 day in the pups treated with TCDD, while vaginal opening was delayed (100% of control pups by postnatal day 13 and 100% of TCDD-treated pups by postnatal day 19). After mating of the female offspring on postnatal day 152\u2013166, a variety of parameters, including fertility, weaning index, number of implants, litter size and pup survival, were significantly reduced in the treated animals. TCDD treatment also increased the frequency of F1 female offspring with mild hypospadias or cleft phallus (0.78% in controls, 92% with TCDD) (Wolf et al., 1999)., 91041=(3) By a direct effect of PCBs on the functioning of the thyroid gland. For example, Aroclor 1254 inhibits proteolysis of thyroglobulin, the protein responsible for release of thyroid hormones from the gland (Collins & Capen, 1980). Furthermore, exposure to TCDD results in an increase in serum TSH concentration and, after long-term exposure, to an increased volume of thyroid follicular cells, increased thyroid weight and thyroid hyperplasia (Bastomsky, 1977; Andrae & Greim, 1992; Hill et al., 1989)., 713229=The reduction in body burdens seen between 1980 and 1983 continued through 1991 (Ryan et al., 1994). As the mean concentration of toxic equivalents decreased between the years of birth of the first and latest age groups of Guo et al. (1993), some dependence of the effects on the year of birth would be expected. Such dependence is observed for penile length but not for other effects. The deficits in sex organ development reported in experimental animals (see section 2.2.5) could be considered similar to the abnormalities in penis length and spermatogenesis reported by Guo et al. (1993). Nevertheless, the estimated body burdens of the mothers in the Yu-Cheng incident (300\u20136000 ng/kg bw) are 6\u2013120 times those (25\u201350 ng/kg bw) associated with the effects in rats that were used as the basis of the safety assessment., 652646=Circles, from Flesch-Janys et al.

No association was found in workers in Nitro, West Virginia, USA (Suskind & Hertzberg, 1984). Among US Air Force personnel exposed in Viet Nam (Henriksen et al., 1997), the prevalence of diabetes and use of oral medication to control diabetes increased with increasing exposure to TCDD, while the time to onset of diabetes decreased with the intensity of exposure to dioxin (Figure 15). Among trichlorophenol production workers in the USA, the prevalence of diabetes was not associated with serum concentrations of TCDD. Men with very high TCDD concentrations (> 1500 pg/g), however, tended to have a high prevalence of diabetes (Calvert et al., 1999). In the industrial cohort in the USA (Steenland et al., 1999), any mention of diabetes on the death certificate was negatively associated with exposure. An increased rate of mortality from diabetes was seen among women who had been in zone A or B in Seveso (rate ratio, 24; 95% CI, 1.2\u20134.6), but no excess was observed among men (Pesatori et al., 1998)., 636880=The range of PTMIs derived from the two studies, with either the linear or the power model for extrapolating the maternal body burden after single or multiple doses, is 40\u2013100 pg/kg bw per month. The mid-point of this range, 70 pg/kg bw per month, was chosen as the PTMI for use in the safety assessment. Further-more, in concordance with the 1998 WHO consultation (van Leeuwen & Younes, 2000), the Committee concluded that this tolerable intake should be applied to the intake of PCDDs, PCDFs and coplanar compounds expressed in WHO TEFs., 498061=1992, 91611=In rats, short-term dietary intake of TCDD (14\u20131000 ng/kg bw per day) reduced the hepatic concentrations of retinol and retinylpalmitate at the lowest dose tested. The concentration of plasma retinol was increased concomitantly. The mechanism behind this effect consists of induction of CYP enzymes, which oxidize retinol and reduce the activity of acyl coenzyme A:retinyl acyltransferase and lecithin:retinol acyltransferase. Both enzymes participate in the esterification of retinol. In a short-term study in Sprague-Dawley rats treated in the diet, the NOEL of 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-HxCB for depletion of hepatic retinoids was 81 \u00b5g/kg bw per day (van Birgelen et al., 1994a). In a similar study, the LOEL of 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB for this effect was 0.47\u00a0\u00b5g/kg bw per day (van Birgelen et al., 1994b)., 931504=Zober, A., Ott, M.G. & Messerer, P.

However, for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998, only 49, 40 and 47 determinations, respectively, were available for calculation of the percentiles. As percentiles exclude the effect of maximum contamination, the 99th percentile for those years is equal to the maximum. This value is therefore meaningless. Additionally, samples for 1996\u201398 and for the summarized range 1995\u201398 included pooled samples. As the frequency distribution was calculated without weighting, they represent the distribution of determinations and can be used only as an indication of the distribution. These percentiles should therefore be used with caution., 841053=Environmental Protection Agency (2000a) Health assessment of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds.

The smallest intake (300 ml; two women) was associated with minimal effects on the infants, whereas intakes of 700\u20131400 ml (five women) were associated with symptoms typical of those seen in adults, and some of the infants were recorded as small-for-date. The highest intake (2600 ml) was associated with a stillbirth, and the woman had severe chloracne, as did another woman who had a stillborn infant but whose intake was not estimated., 504172=Japan: A report on the tolerable daily intake of dioxins in Japan showed a decrease in the concentration of toxic equivalents of PCDDs/PCDFs in breast milk between 1973 and 1995, from about 30 pg/g of fat in the 1970s to about 20 pg/g of fat in the 1990s, and, for coplanar PCBs, from about 30 pg/g of fat to about 10 pg/g of fat (Environment Agency of Japan, 1999). A range of 12\u201337 pg/g of fat was reported for international toxic equivalents (Hashimoto et al., 1995; Hirakawa et al., 1995). The Environmental Protection Agency (2000a) in the USA reported that samples collected in Japan between 1989 and 1992 contained 28\u201345 pg/g of lipid expressed as WHO toxic equivalents of PCDDs/PCDFs., 930497=Zeilmaker, M.J. & van Eijkeren, J.C.H.

(1999) reported that nine men without chloracne who had worked in the same production unit as seven men who developed chloracne had a serum concentration of toxic equivalents (pooled sample) of 400\u2013600 ng/kg of lipid, corresponding to about 100 ng/kg bw. In Seveso, people living in zone A and who did not develop chloracne were found to have a serum concentration of TCDD of 1770\u201310\u00a0400 ng/kg of lipid, corresponding to body burdens of 400\u20136000 ng/kg. Geusau et al. (1999) reported that three co-workers of two women with chloracne had serum concentra-tions of TCDD of 0.09, 0.1 and 0.86 ng/kg of lipid (~ 200 ng/kg bw) but did not develop chloracne., 589800=The safety assessment was based on the results of tests in animals designed to identify the region of the dose\u2013response function (for dioxin toxic equivalents alone, without consideration of the benefits of the food) that is presumed to result in no effect. This method produces a \u2018tolerable intake\u2019. It involves three steps: evaluation of the database to eliminate any studies that are of insufficient quality or would not predict the human response, identification of a single most sensitive study as the basis for establishing a safe level of intake, and expression of the results of this study according to a conventional algorithm, usually dividing the largest NOAEL by a safety factor with a default value of 100 but which can be assigned values of 3\u20131000. This procedure is designed to be biased towards health protection. Nevertheless, this protective bias is based on certain assumptions that are not always true, e.g. that human susceptibility to the chemical being assessed is within the range of that of the animals tested and that the groups of animals at the different doses in a test are large enough., 221596=Several reports have been published on workers at a chemical plant operated by Boehringer-Ingelheim in Hamburg, Germany, that produced herbicides heavily contaminated with TCDD and other PCDDs and PCDFs (Manz et al., 1991; Nagel et al., 1994; Flesch-Janys et al., 1995). An outbreak of chloracne in 1954 led to a halt in the production of trichlorophenol and 2,4,5-trichlorphenoxyacetic acid. In 1957, production was resumed, with a new process that reduced the formation of TCDD. The vital status of all persons who had been permanent employees at the plant for at least 3 months between 1 January 1952 and 31 December 1984 (1184 men, 399 women) was investigated through to 1989 (Manz et al., 1991). The causes of death were ascertained from medical records or, when medical records were not available, from death certificates. The concentrations of TCDD were measured in samples of serum or adipose tissue from workers in various production departments, mainly after the plant had closed in 1984., 906040=Ryan, J.J., Hsu, C.-C., Boyle, M.J. & Guo, Y.-L.L.

The rate of death from cancer in general was not increased over the period of observation. However, 15 years after the accident, the mortality rate from cancer was increased in men among the 804 inhabitants of zone A and the 5941 inhabitants of zone B, with a rate ratio of 1.3 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.0\u20131.7. Increases were also seen in the rate of death from rectal cancer (rate ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2\u20134.6) and lung cancer (rate ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0\u20131.7), but with no definite pattern of latency.

Similarly, (mean) absorption fractions of 0.84 (range, 0.66\u20130.93) after oral administration in corn oil (Rose et al., 1976)) and 0.88 (standard deviation, 1.7) after oral administration in a 1:1:3 solution of vegetable oil, ethanol and water (Diliberto et al., 1996) have been reported for TCDD in rats., 117975=In an experiment designed to identify the lowest effective doses and body burdens of TCDD in rats, groups of eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets formulated to deliver TCDD at a dose of 0, 14, 26, 47, 320 or 1000 ng/kg bw per day for 13 weeks. The most sensitive effects, seen at the lowest dose, included hepatic CYP 1A1 and 1A2 induction and significant decreases in thymus weights and hepatic retinol concentration. At the higher doses, differences in liver, kidney and spleen weights and decreases in plasma T3 and free T4 concentrations were seen. The estimated NOEL (by sigmoidal curve fitting) for hepatic EROD induction was 0.35\u00a0ng/kg bw per day, which corresponds to a liver TCDD content of 0.037 ng/g (van Birgelen et al., 1995a,b)., 858304=Hoogenboom, L.A.P.

In: Watson, D.H., ed., Contaminants, Weimar, Texas: Culinary and Hospitality Industry Publications Service, pp. 91\u2013106., 347097=In all countries in which substantial numbers of samples have been analysed over time, the concentrations of dioxin in food were decreasing up to the end of the 1990s. In several countries, this decrease was slowed, or even partly reversed in some food categories, due to contamination of feed. In addition, at the end of the 1990s, the measurements initiated at the beginning of the decade did not show the same strong reduction. For the international intake assessment reported here, only data collected after 1995 were considered. These represent 13\u00a0589 food products pooled in 1256 samples for PCDDs/PCDFs and 2636 food products pooled in 796 samples for PCBs., 715800=No frank effects, such as birth defects or chromosomal abnormalities, were found in infants of women exposed in Seveso, where the median body burden in zone A was about 110 ng/kg bw on the basis of a median concentration of TCDD of 440 ng/kg of lipid in blood samples taken soon after the accident and an assumption of 25% body fat (Bertazzi et al., 1998a). Exposure in zone A did vary widely, however, and some persons had effects including chloracne, transient increases in liver enzyme activity and transient neurological effects (Bertazzi et al., 1998a). The median peak exposure in zone B has been estimated to have been about 90 ng/kg of lipid, corresponding to a body burden of TCDD of about 22 ng/kg bw. Addition of background concentrations of other congeners that contribute to total toxic equivalents (estimated background body burden in 1976, 6\u20138 ng/kg bw) would increase the total body burden of toxic equivalents in this group to 28\u201330 ng/kg bw. No overt effects were observed in this population., 683814=1780, 824189=Buhler, F., Schmid, P. & Schlatter, C.H. (1988) Kinetics of PCB elimination in man.

Chemosphere, 29, 2423\u20132437., 711436=The body burdens of the mothers can be estimated from data reported during the time the children were born. Estimates of the blood lipid concentrations of 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF of the Yu-Cheng patients can be converted to toxic equivalents from the WHO TEFs and Table 2 of Carrier et al. (1995b), as shown above. On the basis of mean concentrations of 10\u00a0000 ng/kg for 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and 30\u00a0000\u00a0ng/kg for 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF for 67 persons in 1980, the mean population body burden of toxic equivalents in that year can be estimated to have been 6000 ng/kg bw. Similarly, on the basis of measurements made on samples taken in 1983, the mean mean population body burden of toxic equivalents in that year can be estimated to have been 1200 ng/kg bw. An approximate lower bound of the body burden in those years can be estimated from the body burden associated with development of chloracne in female victims of the Yusho incident (>\u00a06000 ng/kg bw) and the estimated depuration rates (Carrier et al., 1995b). The minimum body burdens of toxic equivalents in 1980 and 1983 can be estimated to have been 3000 and 370 ng/kg bw, respectively. A rough check on this estimate can be made from the observation that the minimum recorded dose in the Yusho incident was about one-fourth the mean; this suggests that the minima in 1980 and 1983 would have been approximately 1500 ng/kg bw and 300\u00a0ng/kg bw, respectively. As severe chloracne is somewhat disabling, women with body burdens at the lower end of this range would probably have been more likely to become pregnant. Thus, the mothers of children in the cohort studied by Guo et al. (1993) can be estimated to have had body burdens of 1500\u20136000 ng/kg bw in 1979\u201381 and 300\u20131200 ng/kg bw in 1982\u201384., 845886=Flesch-Janys, D., Berger, J., Konietzko, J., Gurn, P., Manz, A., Nagel, S., Waltsgott, H. & Dwyer, J.H.

In one of the plants, where the main compound produced was 2,4,5-trichlorphenoxyacetic acid and its derivatives, an accident in 1963, which caused a release of PCDDs, including TCDD. In a second factory, (4-chloro-ortho-toloxy)acetic acid, 4-chloro-2-methyl phenoxypropionic acid and 2,4-D were produced. The study involved 2074 men working in manufacture at the two plants (963 exposed to phenoxy herbicides, 1111 not exposed); in addition, 145 workers who had probably been exposed to TCDD during the industrial accident and clean-up were examined. The study was later extended to 1991 and enlarged (2298 persons, including 191 women) (Hooiveld et al., 1998). Exposure was assessed from job histories and on modelled concentrations of TCDD in serum, measured in 1993 in a subset of 31 exposed (mean concentration, 53 ng/kg of lipid; range, 1.9\u2013190 ng/kg) and 16 unexposed (mean concentration, 8 ng/kg of lipid) persons. Fourteen persons who had been exposed during the accident in 1963 had the highest mean concentration (96\u00a0ng/kg of lipid; range, 16\u2013190 ng/kg). In this factory, the mortality rates from all causes (139 deaths; SMR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1\u20131.5) and all cancers (51 deaths; SMR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1\u20131.9) were significantly increased. Excess numbers of deaths from cancers of the urinary bladder (four deaths; SMR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.0\u20139.5) and kidney (four deaths; SMR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.1\u201310) and from non-Hodgkin lymphoma (three deaths; SMR, 3.8; 95% CI, 0.8\u2013 11) were observed. When the workers were subdivided into three categories of low, medium and high exposure according to the serum concentrations of TCDD predicted from a model, the relative risks for death from all causes, all cancers and lung cancer were significantly increased for workers with medium and high exposure and were highest for the group with the heaviest exposure (Figure 11)., 503319=1998, 898358=Pluim, H.J., Wever, J., Koppe, J.G., van den Slikke, J.W. & Olie, K.

The activities of liver-specific enzymes were induced by 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-HxCB at 450 \u00b5g/kg bw per day, and the activity of EROD in skin and lung was induced by doses > 1500 \u00b5g/kg bw per day. 3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5,5\u00b4-HxCB at doses up to 3 \u00b5g/kg bw per day did not induce enzyme activity. The LOEL for the induction of hepatic EROD activity was 3900 \u00b5g/kg bw per day with the PCB 2,3,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4-PeCB and 300 \u00b5g/kg bw per day with 2,3\u00b4,4,4\u00b4,5-PeCB, whereas that with TCDD was 0.0015 \u00b5g/kg bw per day (DeVito et al., 2000)., 876135=Lindstr\u00f6m, G., Haug, L.S. & Nicolaysen, T.

(1995) Absorption of polychlorinated biphenyls, dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans by breast-fed infants. , 30, 2297\u20132306., 45470=In the liver, protein binding plays an important role in the uptake of dioxin-like compounds from the blood, even for lower-chlorinated congeners. When rodents are exposed to increasing doses of TCDD, preferential accumulation occurs in the microsomal fraction of the liver, such that the concentration exceeds that in adipose tissue by many fold (Allen et al., 1975; Kociba et al., 1978a,b; Gasiewicz et al., 1983; Abraham et al., 1988; Leung, 1990a,b; Weber et al., 1993; Diliberto et al., 1996; Santastefano et al., 1996; Viluksela et al., 1996; Diliberto et al., 1999). The biochemical mechanism behind this phenomenon is as follows. After entering the liver cells, TCDD may dissolve in hepatic lipid, bind to an intracellular Ah receptor protein, or bind to cytochrome P450 (CYP) proteins, in particular CYP 1A2 (Poland et al., 1989a,b; Santastefano et al., 1996; Diliberto et al., 1997, 1998, 1999). As the amount of cellular CYP proteins is regulated by formation of the TCDD\u2013Ah-receptor complex, exposure to increasing amount of TCDD triggers the cascade of events (protein induction) comprising increased entry of TCDD into the cell, increased formation of the TCDD\u2013Ah-receptor complex, increased formation of CYP 1A2 mRNA and CYP 1A2 protein and increased binding of TCDD to the induced CYP 1A2 proteins (Whitlock et al., 1997)., 106276=One of the commoner symptoms associated with dioxin-induced death is generalized delayed wasting syndrome, characterized by inhibition of gluconeo-genesis, reduced feed intake and loss of body weight. Although some differences exist between species, other toxic responses observed after single doses of dioxins include haemorrhage in a number of organs, thymic atrophy, reduced bone-marrow cellularity and loss of body fat and lean muscle mass. For example, in groups of five or six golden Syrian hamsters of each sex given a single oral or intraperitoneal dose of TCDD at 0, 5, 25, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2000 or 3000\u00a0\u00b5g/kg bw, deaths occurred at doses >\u00a0500\u00a0\u00b5g/kg bw, oral administration generally being more toxic. At the highest dose, 33% of males treated intraperitoneally and 80% of those treated orally died. The consistent pathological findings included gradual loss of adipose and muscle tissue (wasting syndrome), thymic atrophy and gastrointestinal lesions. The estimated LD50 values were >\u00a03000 \u00b5g/kg bw for intraperitoneal administration and 1200 \u00b5g/kg bw for oral dosing (Olson et al., 1980)., 707175=Developmental effects in children who ingested contaminated oil in the Yusho incident were reviewed by Yoshimura (1996). Hyperpigmentation, delayed physical growth and nervous system development were found in essentially all children who also had other symptoms of the Yusho syndrome. Although the growth rate deficiencies continued throughout adolescence, the ultimate height of both boys and girls was normal. No symptoms of neurological deficits were observed, but this has not been studied sytematically. In addition, 13 women who were pregnant when they ingested the contaminated Yusho oil had two stillbirths, and nine of the 11\u00a0liveborn infants showed signs of intoxication, including stained skin and ocular discharge. Although size at birth was not known for two infants, four were small and showed more severe dermal symptoms. The two \u2018unaffected\u2019 infants had some signs of neonatal jaundice but were otherwise normal. One had been exposed only during the third trimester and the other early in the second trimester; their mothers were estimated to have ingested 300 ml of contaminated oil at those times in their pregnancies (~ 4000 ng/kg bw as toxic equivalents), and one had grade 0 and the other grade 2 symptoms. The other women had ingested 700\u20132600 ml of oil (10\u00a0000\u201335\u00a0000 ng/kg bw) during some or all of their pregnancies. One of the two stillbirths was associated with the largest consumption of oil, and the woman had very severe (grade 4) symptoms. No information was available on the oil consumption of the second women who had a stillbirth; the severity of her symptoms was recorded as grade 3., 881801=Mastroiacovo, P., Spagnolo, A., Marni, E., Meazza, L., Bertollini, R., Segni, G. & Borgna-Pignatti, C.

Several short\u2013term assays for genotoxicity with TCDD covering various end-points gave primarily negative results. Furthermore, TCDD did not bind covalently to mouse liver DNA., 85903=Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a plasma membrane receptor which, after binding a specific ligand, functions as a signal tranducer regulating cellular proliferation. This effect is mediated by internalization of the ligand\u2013receptor complex and then phosphorylation of intracellular targets by tyrosine kinase. The effects of TCDD on hepatic EGF and their relationship to hepatic carcinogenesis are as follows. TCDD is a known inducer of liver tumours in female, but not male, rats (Kociba et al., 1978). It also induces proliferation of hepatocytes and preneoplastic foci in intact, but not ovariectomized, female rats (Lucier et al., 1991), indicating an important role of estrogens in hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, treatment with TCDD results in a dose-dependent decrease in the number of EGF binding sites in the liver (Lucier et al., 1991; Kohn et al., 1993, short-term exposure to 3.5\u2013125 ng/kg bw per day), indicating internalization of the receptor after TCDD binding (Kohn et al., 1993) and induction of TGF-alpha, a ligand of the EGF receptor., 742088=where f is the fraction of dose absorbed from food (assumed to be 50% in humans) and the estimated half-life of TCDD is 2774 days (7.6 years).

    "textBeforeTable": "(a) Reproductive effects While there was clear evidence that dioxins and coplanar chemicals can cause a variety of adverse reproductive effects in experimental animals, the evidence for human populations was limited, except for the two episodes of rice oil poisoning in South-East Asia. Accidental consumption of rice oil contaminated with heat-degraded PCBs occurred in two separate episodes, in Japan in 1968 and in Taiwan (Province of China) in 1979. These incidents are referred to as \u2018Yusho\u2019 and \u2018Yu-cheng\u2019, which mean \u2018oil poisoning\u2019 in Japanese and Chinese, respectively. Large numbers of persons were exposed. In the Yusho incident, the average intake of the rice oil contaminated with PCBs, PCDFs and polychlorinated quaterphenyls was estimated to have been 150 ng/kg bw per day (as toxic equivalents), which is five orders of magnitude higher than the reported average background intake in several countries. Analysis of the rice oils in question showed that other chlorinated compounds, including polychlorinated terphenyls, naphthalenes, quarterphenyls and furans, were present, in addition to the PCBs Chen et al., 1985; Masuda et al., 1985). A number of attempts have been made to determine whether US Air Force personnel involved in spraying TCDD-contaminated herbicides during the Viet Nam War had higher rates of adverse reproductive outcomes (for a review, see Environmental Protection Agency, 2000a). While there have been no strong indications of decreased fertility rates or an increased risk for adverse birth outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion, stillbirths or intrauterine growth retardation, some results suggest higher rates of birth",
    "textAfterTable": "Adapted from Bertazzi et al. (1998a) Chloracne persisted in a few workers in plants in Germany and the USA many years after exposure. In Seveso residents, the condition disappeared after discontinuation of exposure, despite very high initial serum concentrations of TCDD, ranging from 820 to 56 000 pg/g, measured within 1 year of the accident. Although chloracne is associated with the intensity of exposure to TCDD, there is no direct correlation between exposure and the occurrence of chloracne. Persons with severe chloracne are often found, on a group level, to have had heavier average exposure than those with moderate or no chloracne. This can clearly be seen in the analysis of TCCD concentrations of BASF workers exposed during the accident (Zober et al., 1997). However, an absence of chloracne is not equivalent to an absence of exposure, and the presence of chloracne is not necessarily equivalent to very heavy exposure. Various other dermal effects other than chloracne have been described among persons exposed to TCDD, including red, irritated eyes, conjunctivitis and blepharitis, eyelid cysts, hyperpigmentation and hirsutism. These findings have been reported less frequently than chloracne. (d) Gastrointestinal effects and effects on hepatic enzymes Increased liver size was reported in workers in two trichlorophenol production plants, one in the former Czechoslovakia and the other in the USA.
