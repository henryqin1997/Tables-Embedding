            "HIGH TEMPERATURE MEMORY DEVICE - Disclosed herein are various nonvolatile integrated device embodiments suitable for use at high temperatures. In some embodiments, a high temperature nonvolatile integrated device comprises a sapphire or spinel substrate having multiple ferroelectric memory cells disposed upon it. In other embodiments, a high temperature nonvolatile integrated device comprises a silicon on insulator substrate or a large bandgap semiconductor substrate having multiple ferroelectric or magnetic memory cells disposed on it. In yet other embodiments, a high temperature nonvolatile integrated device comprises a sapphire, silicon on insulator, or a large bandgap substrate having programmable read only memory (PROM) cells or electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM) cells disposed on it.",
            "Controllable Chemical Injection For Multiple Zone Completions - This disclosure relates to an apparatus and method for controlling the amount of an additive injected into production fluid in a plurality of production zones. The injection devices may be dynamically controlled such that a central or decentralized control system may instruct a plurality of additive injection assemblies to inject additive, wherein different additive and/or different amounts of additive may be injected in the production fluid in the plurality of production zones. The apparatus includes one or more controllers to send operating commands to downhole regulating elements that may control the amount of additive being injected directly or indirectly.",
            "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR OPERATING MONITORING ELEMENTS AND SINGLE USE ELEMENTS WITH A COMMON CABLE - A system includes a common line configured to conduct electrical power and one or more monitoring devices coupled to the common line and configured to operate when a positive voltage is provided on the common line. The system also includes a single use device coupled to the common line and an activation circuit coupled between the single use device and the common line, the activation circuit only allowing current to flow through the single use device when a negative voltage is provided on the common line."

Freeman, Houston, TX US 11-25-2010 METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS TO REDUCE SCATTERING OF LIGHT DURING THERAPEUTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING PROCEDURES - Disclosed are improved methods and compositions for use in light-based in vivo imaging and treatment. The techniques described involve the use of low-scattering, oxygen-carrying blood substitutes in imaging and treatment methods, including OCT imaging. The invention has particular advantages in imaging within the cardiovascular system and highly vascularized or oxygen-dependent tissues. 20100298716 Published Description Patent application number Gregory L. Freeman, San Antonio, TX US 03-26-2009 Display interface target positioning tool - A target positioning tool for use during the scanning of a dental preparation enables an operator to ensure that the preparation is always properly positioned. In one embodiment, the tool comprises an outer circle and a pair of arcs that are positioned back-to-back. The arcs enable the operator to correctly align the scan to the preparation or with a preparation margin. Preferably, the size of the circle is constant and remains so as the view moves in and out on the display screen. 20090081617 Published Description Patent application number Glen R.

Freeman, Houston, TX US James Joseph Freeman, Houston, TX US Patent application number Description Published 20090294123 MULTI-POINT INJECTION SYSTEM FOR OILFIELD OPERATIONS - A system monitors and controls the injection of additives into formation fluids recovered through a well may include a plurality of nozzles that receive the injection fluid from an umbilical disposed in a well. Each nozzle may have an associated flow control element that is configured to affect a flow of the injection fluid ejected through the associated nozzle. The umbilical may include one or more filters positioned in a first of two parallel conduits formed along the umbilical. An occlusion member restricts in a second of the two conduits. The occlusion member permits flow in the second conduit after a predetermined pressure differential exists in the second conduit. The system may include a plurality of pressure sensors disposed along the umbilical, and an injector unit that dispenses fluid into the umbilical. A controller operatively coupled to the injector unit operates the injector in response to measurements from the pressure sensors. 12-03-2009 20110307191 METHOD OF DETERMINING POSITION OF A VALVE - A method of determining the position of",
