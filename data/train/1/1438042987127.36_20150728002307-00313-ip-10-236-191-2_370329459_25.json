enriched the Cisco TelePresence solution. In addition, the infrastructure components and endpoint solutions have also increased comprehensively, most notably in the areas of call processing, conferencing, and scheduling. Therefore, similar components now exist and have been incorporated into this document for unification and understanding. Furthermore, note that the key differentiator among the TelePresence endpoint/solution and the integrated Tandberg endpoint/solution is the standard that is used for communications between the infrastructure components and endpoints. Most often Tandberg endpoints are referred to as \u201cstandards-based endpoints,\u201d and traditional TelePresence endpoints are referred to as \u201cTIP\u201d endpoints, as the latter leverages the TelePresence Interoperability Protocol (TIP) for communication., 21971=The codec is the engine that drives the entire Cisco TelePresence solution. All displays, cameras, microphones, and speakers connect to the codec that communicates with the network and handles all audio and video processing. The codec runs a highly-integrated version of the Linux operating system on an embedded Compact Flash module, and is managed through Secure Shell (SSH) and Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer (HTTPs) for security purposes., 55462=With regard to the Cisco TelePresence System, Cisco Unified Communications Manager focus is the security of the end devices, that is, phones and codecs. Securing these devices entails utilizing the phone/device security profile, enabling encrypted \u201cDevice Security Mode\u201dsecure transport types such as TLS, and authentication modes with the use of strings and key sizes as long as possible (for instance 2048 bits). The security profile should be assigned to all end devices that are to be secured. When defining the security profile, choose the default authentication mode, which is \u201cBy Authenticating String.\u201d \u00a0Additionally, change the default credentials of admin/cisco that are defined in the profile to values that are much more difficult for an attacker to guess because these credentials are used to perform web administration on the Cisco Telepresence System., 26858=Because the Microsoft Exchange server typically supports more functionality than scheduling TelePresence meetings, the security is slightly out of the scope of this document. There are many resources for securing Exchange servers available on the Microsoft website. For instance, if you are running Microsoft Exchange 2003, you can follow the Windows Server 2003 Security Baseline. In any case, Exchange server configurations should be hardened., 46832=Note: \u00a0When employing CAPF, use the longest key size possible (for instance 2048 bits)., 53557=You need to create CAPF profiles for the application users that you created. These profiles contain the specific details required to authenticate the Cisco TelePresence client to server communications. Leverage the CAPF profile security functionality by using an authentication mode of \u201cBy Authentication String\u201d and a strong authentication string combination. In addition, ensure you leverage the longest key size possible (for instance 2048 bits)., 19293=The Cisco TelePresence System supports several different models, from small groups (Cisco TelePresence System 500, 1000/1100, DX70, DX80, DX650, and EX and MXP Series) and one-on-one meetings around a \"virtual table,\" to large boardroom meetings. The DX models run the Android operating system, which has some special considerations for hardening. Administrators should consider disabling any features that are not needed. For example, if the Cisco TelePresence DX system is in a public location, administrators should consider restricting the system hardware and software features more than if the system was in a secured corporate setting. On a small scale, two Cisco TelePresence 1000/1100 systems in a single meeting can create a virtual \"roundtable\" for a maximum of four participants. Furthermore, the multipoint meeting options can support up to 48 geographic locales on a single call., 21377=One of the goals of Cisco TelePresence is to hide the technology from the user so that participants experience the meeting instead of the technology. Hidden underneath the plasma displays of the CTS-3200, CTS-3000/3010, and CTS-1000/1100 solutions are the Cisco TelePresence codecs. The CTS-3000/3010 and CTS-3200/3210 consist of a primary codec and two secondary codecs. Both the CTS-1000/1100 and CTS-500/EX Series utilize a single primary codec. An additional optional codec is available as an upgrade for high-speed (30 frames per second) auxiliary video input., 48518=You need to create CAPF profiles for the application users that you created. These profiles contain the specific details required to authenticate the Cisco TelePresence client to server communications. Leverage the CAPF profile security functionality by using an authentication mode of \u201cBy Authentication String\u201d and a strong authentication string combination. In addition, ensure you leverage the longest key size possible (for instance 2048 bits).}",
