            "Scrub Testing Devices and Methods - The invention provides, in one embodiment, a device for performing scrub testing on a plurality of samples simultaneously, including a plurality of scrubbing devices. A stage is provided which positions the plurality of samples in contact with the plurality of scrubbing devices. The scrubbing devices can individually be provided with different weights to produce different forces on the samples. A motion producing device produces one or both of linear and rotational motion between the brushes and the samples. The scrubbing devices are held in the stage so as move freely vertically.",
