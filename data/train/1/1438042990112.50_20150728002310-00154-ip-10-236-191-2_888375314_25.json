Not to mention the wifi they use there is HORRIBLE. Like bad. They have very..catholic rules in the dorms which isn't surprising. So no inviting your sweetie over for the night. I gave the dorm life a 2 because of the prices, cramped space, bad wifi (seriously it's 2015 y'all, get with the program), and because after paying an arm and a leg...you have to follow some silly rules. Oh, and you get room checks by the way...every week....so no paraphernalia of ANY kind! I think it's an invasion of privacy though...but that's why I live at home where I don't get constantly checked and have fast wi-fi and free food!, 123745=There really isn't a big tradition aspect to UST but the class of 2016 is starting a new tradition of not walking on the seal which is in the sidewalk walking toward the academic mall. UST is in the middle of a quiet neighborhood which is great to take nice walks through and being in the middle of the Montrose area lends it's own unusual aspect to the community., 181926=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

All over campus there are also emergency telephones, but rarely has anyone been in danger on campus. Students tend to always feel safe, but just in case we always keep them close by. Greek Life There are no Frats or Sororities, but males are allowed to join at the University of Houston fraternities. Clubs and Activities There are about 80 clubs on campus and they are all different and unique. From cheer leading club to the chemistry club. They all vary and all you have to do is sign up to become a member. Its a great way to get involved, and host events on campus.",
