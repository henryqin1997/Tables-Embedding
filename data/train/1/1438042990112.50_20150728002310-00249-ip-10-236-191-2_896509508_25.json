I hated that I was required to spend $2000 on a meal plan for that crap and then had a ton of money left over at the end of the semester to buy bulk with., 157066=There are many. This college is very diverse. We have the ball in December (our theme this year was Bollywood).

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students that like smaller, more hands-on classes. Those who would not like to be in a 300-student lecture hall, but rather a 20-student classroom. Bang for the buck It is more expensive since it's a private school, but I think in the long run it'll be worth it! Am enjoying being here Everyone is very friendly, and with it being an all women's college, everyone is very supportive! Am learning a lot They definitely challenge you & push you outside of your comfort zone! It may seem awkward at first, but I just finished my 1st semester here & I look back and realize how much I've grown already.
