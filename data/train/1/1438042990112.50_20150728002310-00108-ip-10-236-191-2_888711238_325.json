Among other things, the CALM Act directs the Commission to incorporate into its rules by reference and make mandatory a technical standard, developed by an industry standards development body, that is designed to prevent digital television commercial advertisements from being transmitted at louder volumes than the program material they accompany. As mandated by the statute, the rules apply to digital TV broadcasters, digital cable operators, and other digital multichannel video programming distributors (\u201cMVPDs\u201d). Also per the statute, the rules will take effect one year after adoption, and will therefore be effective as of December 13, 2012. The rules adopted are designed to protect viewers from excessively loud commercials and, at the same time, permit broadcasters and MVPDs to implement their obligations in a minimally burdensome manner. The Commission will require broadcast stations and MVPDs to ensure that all commercials are transmitted to consumers at the appropriate loudness level in accordance with the industry standard., 432083=This document announces the effective date of rules published in the Federal Register on November 20, 2002. The final rules modified the TV Table of Allotments., 447007=In this document, the Commission modifies its rules in order to implement provisions of the Local Community Radio Act of 2010 (\u201cLCRA\u201d). It also proposes changes to its rules intended to promote the low power FM service's localism and diversity goals, reduce the potential for licensing abuses, and clarify certain rules., 776443=The Federal Communications Commission published a document in the Federal Register of October 27, 2014 (79 FR 63883), regarding Petitions for Reconsideration filed of Action in a rulemaking proceeding. The document contained the incorrect deadline for filing replies to an opposition to the Petition. This document revises the deadline for replies to an opposition to the Petition., 638407=In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) further extends the deadline for filing comments on the Auction 1000 Request for Comment, which initiates the pre-auction process by which the Federal Communications Commission will develop detailed procedures for the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction, taking into account public comment received in response to its proposals., 713400=The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by KCEB License Company, LLC (\u201cKCEB License\u201d), the licensee of KCEB(TV), channel 51, Longview, Texas, requesting the substitution of channel 26 for channel 51 at Longview. While the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of full power television rulemaking petitions requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it subsequently announced that it would lift the freeze to accept such petitions for rulemaking seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees. KCEB License has entered into such a voluntary relocation agreement with T-Mobile USA, Inc. and states that operation on channel 26 would eliminate potential interference to and from wireless operations in the adjacent Lower 700 MHZ A Block., 546730=The Commission issues this final rule in response to a petition for rulemaking filed by Lincoln Broadcasting, LLC (\u201cLBL\u201d), licensee of KFXL-TV, channel 51, Lincoln, Nebraska, requesting the substitution of channel 15 for channel 51 at Lincoln. While the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of full power television rulemaking petitions requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it subsequently announced that it would lift the freeze to accept such petitions for rulemaking seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees. Furthermore, according to LBL, this channel substitution is in the public interest as it will increase the station's service area by almost 700, 000 persons., 301459=The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) is correcting final rules that appeared in the Federal Register of 78 FR 66288, November 5, 2013. The document issued final rules that establish a single protection scheme for tower construction and modification near AM tower arrays and designate \u201cmoment method\u201d computer modeling as the principal means of determining whether a nearby tower affects an AM radiation pattern. This correction makes no change to the substance of the rules., 570034=The Incentive Auction Task Force provides the results of several staff simulations of the initial clearing target optimization procedure proposed in the Auction 1000 Comment PN and/or Comment PN as discussed further in this under the Supplementary Information. In this document, the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) Incentive Auction Task Force seeks comment on the data and analyses released in this document and the attached Appendix.}",
