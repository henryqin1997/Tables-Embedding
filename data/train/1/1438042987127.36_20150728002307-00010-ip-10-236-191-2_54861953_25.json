The play was reviewed, but the ruling was upheld to give San Diego a 27-3 edge with 5:16 left in the third., 82776=Pittsburgh answered with a scoring march, as Roethlisberger converted a pair of third downs before capping the 10-play trek with an 11-yard TD toss to Wallace to cut the margin to 34-17 with just over six minutes left.}",
