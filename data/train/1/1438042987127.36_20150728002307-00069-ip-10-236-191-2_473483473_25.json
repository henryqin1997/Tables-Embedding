    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{44899=EMLA cream achieves higher concentrations of lidocaine in the oil phase compared to other creams by including prilocaine in the formulation, thereby facilitating the solid to oil phase transition of lidocaine. The resulting eutectic mixture has a lidocaine:prilocaine ratio that ranges from 20:80 to 58:42 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,562,060) and the commercially available product (EMLA) has a lidocaine:prilocaine ratio of 50:50. However, as noted above, prilocaine is known for causing methemoglobinemia in children., 42758=Metabolites of prilocaine, however, are known to be responsible for methemoglobinemia, a serious condition characterized by the ferric form of hemoglobin with impaired oxygen-carrying capacity (B. Jakobson et al., Acta Anaesthesialogica Scandinavica 29: 453-455 (1985)). As a result, the use of EMLA in young children has been severely restricted. For example, in the United States, EMLA is currently contraindicated in infants under 3 months old (M. Buckley et al., Drugs 46:126-151 (1993)), and in infants up to 1 year of age who are also receiving methemoglobin-inducing agents (Physician's Desk Reference, 49th Ed., Medical Economics Data Production Company, Montvale, N.H. (1995)). In the United Kingdom, EMLA is not approved for use in children under 1 year of age (S. Russell et al., Drug Safety 16:279-287 (1997)). Also, the Drug Information Handbook, 4th Ed. (1996-1997), published by the American Pharmaceutical Association, states that EMLA cream should not be used in infants under the age of 1 month. Very young patients, and patients with glucose-6-phosphate deficiencies, show increased susceptibility to methemoglobinemia., 41111=This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/134,888, filed May 19, 1999., 69791=The melting points of lidocaine and thymol are 68\ufffd C. and 52\ufffd C., respectively. After preparing and storing the mixtures consisting of lidocaine and thymol in the L:T ratios from 1:9 to 9:1 (w:w) at 25\ufffd C., the melting states of the mixtures were examined weekly for 3 months using an optical microscope. Although the mixtures within L:T ratios of 3:7 to 7:3 (w:w) spontaneously form a homogeneous oil at ambient temperature, some crystals and oil co-exist in the mixtures outside this range. For example, in the mixture with the L:T ratio of 8:2 (w:w), a large portion of lidocaine remains as crystalline solid at 25\ufffd C., 77784=A 3-factor factorial design as shown in Table 3 was used to examine the melting states of lidocaine in the presence of both thymol and ethyl alcohol simultaneously at different temperatures. Since thymol alone is capable of depressing the melting point of lidocaine at and below 25\ufffd C. within the L:T ratios of 3:7-7:3 (w:w), only the higher L:T ratios higher than this range were included in the study., 59176=The local anesthetic is preferably provided in its base form, and is preferably lidocaine (also known as lignocaine), tetracaine, benzocaine, prilocaine, procaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine or etidocaine. Lidocaine is 2-diethylamino-N-[2,6-dimethylphenyl]acetamide and is available under the tradename XYLOCAINE. Tetracaine is 2-dimethylaminoethyl-4-n-butylaminobenzoate and is available under the tradename PONTOCAINE. Prilocaine is 2-propylamino-N-(2-tolyl)propionamide and is available under the tradename CITANEST. Procaine is 2-diethylaminoethyl p-aminobenzoate and is available under the tradename of AMINOCAINE. Mepivacaine is 1-methyl-2-(2,6-xylylcarbomoyl)piperidine and is available under the tradename CARBOCAINE. Benzocaine is 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester and is available under the tradename AMERICAINE. Bupivacaine is 1-butyl-2-(2,6-cycylcarbomoyl)piperidine and is available under the tradename MARCAINE. Etidocaine is 2-ethylpropylamino-2,6-n-butyroxylidide and is available under the tradename DURANEST. In embodiments of the composition containing both lidocaine and prilocaine, the lidocaine:prilocaine ratio is preferably higher than about 60:40., 41332=The search continues for a safe and effective topical anesthetic preparation that can ease the pain during dermal procedures, such as venipuncture, intravenous cannulation, punch biopsy and other small incisions, vaccination, and circumcision. A preparation that is safe for use in newborns is especially needed, since circumcision remains a common medical procedure performed on newborns, and existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision. Unfortunately, circumcision of infants is typically performed without any pain-relief treatment even though the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends procedural analgesia (AAP Circumcision Policy Statement, March 1999, pp. 686-693) because safe and effective topical preparations are not currently available., 65735=Thymol (5-methyl-2-isopropyl-1-phenol) is widely used in many pharmaceutical and mouthwash products with proven safety. Interestingly, when lidocaine crystals are mixed directly with thymol crystals, some melting point depression of both lidocaine and thymol occurs and an oil typically forms. However, it is only possible to obtain a homogeneous oil at ambient temperature (that is, at about 20\ufffd C. to about 25\ufffd C.) with the lidocaine:thymol ratio between about 7:3 and 3:7 by weight (see Example I, section A). At higher lidocaine:thymol ratios, lidocaine crystals remain in the oil phase; that is, the oil phase is not homogenous. The two-phase melt system of the invention, which utilizes a second melting point depressing agent, such as ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, and water, was discovered to achieve a higher concentration of the LA in the oil phase than has previously been attainable.}",

The foregoing detailed description and examples have been given for clarity of understanding only. No unnecessary limitations are to be understood therefrom. The invention is not limited to the exact details shown and described, for variations obvious to one skilled in the art will be included within the invention defined by the claims. The pin-prick tests showed that following the application time of 60 minutes, the 6% lidocaine cream and EMLA cream produced comparable anesthetic effects during the 2-hour period after removal of the creams. With respect to the anesthetic activity, the 4% tetracaine cream showed deeper transdermal anesthesia with longer duration than both the 6% lidocaine cream and EMLA cream. Due to safety considerations, the 6% lidocaine cream is preferred. Conclusions ahours 1.96 (0.13) 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.5 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 Tc",
