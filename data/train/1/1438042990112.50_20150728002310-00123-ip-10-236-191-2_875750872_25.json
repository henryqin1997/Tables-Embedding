However, if the number at the top has text after it, this makes the sorting mode alphabetic, unless it ends with a (typically invisible) \"sm=n\".Remember that the results depend on fixes and enhancements in MediaWiki:Common.js; the description applies to the version on Meta. Copies of this help page on other sites are useful for comparison. A sysop can copy the JavaScript-code from Meta. Examples[edit] The sort mode is determined by the table element that is currently in the first non-blank row below the header. (To minimize the deviation from wikibits.js, the code \"ns=..\" works in the first element below the header instead of in the header.) In the case of different data types within one column (according to the criteria mentioned above) the sort mode may change after sorting, which can give a cycle of four or even more instead of two. This is confusing and gives undesired sorting orders, so that can better be avoided. However, it can be complicated to assess whether an element can ever be at the top after any sorting operations on the same and other columns, and this can also change after deleting a row, or adding a column. Therefore it is wise to make sure that every element matches the criterion for the",
