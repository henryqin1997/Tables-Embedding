            "Go to movies, club events.",
            "Right in downtown Boston so there are many places to go eat. I prefer the food court, The Corner, because they have more variety. Moreover, the food inside campus is also good but limited, coffee is awesome at the sawyer cafe.",
            "Don't live here, i commute.",
            "Good classes. Get tougher but with help from many of services here it can be done and good grades and come out of it,.",
            "Be prepared to deal with change. Suffolk may seem like easy because some teachers are lenient but they can be harsh some. We have good teachers here but you need to work hard to get good grades, just like in any other school. But here, i have been told that we get more vacation therefore academically speaking it can be hard.",
            "Suffolk is awesome. Easy to commute to. easy to get around and get to the area."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck This school offers good scholarships and grants for those who work for them. The dorms as I mentioned before are high tech and beautiful, and the view will take your breath away (over the Common)! The food is really nice but the drinks are expensive. The education you are getting here at Suffolk is well worth the money spent! You will learn a lot more from being in a small class then you would from a lecture hall! Will enjoy being here I have wanted to go to this school for about a year and a half now, it is the school of my dreams! It is right in the heart of Boston and the dorms are surrounded by the beauty of the city! The dorms are beautiful especially Miller and the students are friendly and diverse. The city is an amazing place to experience and to dive right into, you can find anything there! Will learn a lot When you walk into a class room of about 16-22 students to one teacher, you really feel at home because everyone knows who you are! You will never sit in a lecture hall with 500 students so if you are that type of person this University isn't for",
