            "Homework/Study load can get a little heavy even without having a job (Though I am in a heavy science/math major so I'm sure that effects my load.)",
            "Apply to the EOPS program, or see if you qualify for CARE, EFY, and ACE programs, they are tremendously helpful!",
            "Golden West, so far, has been a great school. There are a lot of programs that can cover most, if not all, enrollment, book, and material fees. Involvement in the clubs and programs help to provide an excellent support system for their students."
