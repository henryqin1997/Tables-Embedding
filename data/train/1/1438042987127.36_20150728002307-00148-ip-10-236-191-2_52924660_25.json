A 10-yard gain by Marshall on third down wasn't enough to move the chains, but allowed Carpenter to boot a 50-yarder through the uprights for a 24-23 game with 6:42 left., 77592=\"If we eliminate some of those interceptions from last year, if they're not even completions, if we just eliminate them, we win more games during the regular season,\" said Sanchez, who has not thrown an interception this year after throwing 20 in 2009. \"Maybe we get a playoff game at home. That's what we're fighting for.\", 73008=Henne passed for 363 yards and two TDs on 26-of-44 throws, but was picked off by Drew Coleman with 27 seconds left going for the game-tying score, as the Dolphins (2-1) failed at recording their first 3-0 start since 2002., 76650=A trio of penalties hampered the Jets in the red zone, the last a holding call on Matt Slauson that took away Sanchez's five-yard touchdown run. New York settled for a 30-yard Nick Folk field goal with 12:55 remaining in the game., 73925=They started the final march at their own 26-yard line following a penalty, and Ronnie Brown's 17-yard pickup and Davone Bess' 16-yard reception moved Miami to the Jets' 41. Marshall then shed a tackle and got a huge block from Anthony Fasano along the left sideline during a 30-yard catch-and-run., 74775=The Jets went right down on the field on the game's opening possession, converting a pair of third-down tries before Keller pulled in a 24-yard toss in the end zone to cap the impressive 10-play, 72-yard march less than six minutes in.}",
