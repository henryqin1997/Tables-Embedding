Mosier impressed scouts at the Jesse Flores Memorial All-Star Game in November, earning MVP honors with a two-run triple. He has some feel for the barrel and power potential, and he could sneak into the back of the top 10 rounds., 27434=The White Sox have signed 2011 25th round pick RHP Chris Devenski:, 84640=Keenyn Walker is a 2009 OF/P with a 6\u20191\u201d, 185 lb. frame from Salt Lake City, UT who attends Judge Memorial. Keenyn is a lean well put together very athletic player with fluid actions in the outfield. His throws carry well in the outfield with arm strenth. He is a switch hitter at the plate with a line drive swing plane. He showed a bit better from the left side and has good extension in his swing. He stays inside the baseball and uses all fields. He projects very large with added strength and is a very good, 6.53 sixty. Walker is extremely athletic and he could skyrocket up the charts by next year., 37854=Other White Sox links: U-God writes a pretty awesome \u2018Kenny Williams at the trade deadline\u2019 simulator, James says if the Sox decide to trade Carlos Quentin they shouldn\u2019t stop there, Mike looks at the Edwin Jackson/Mark Teahen for Jason Frasor/Zach Stewart trade, and 2011 supplemental 1st round pick Keenyn Walker was promoted to the Class A Kannapolis Intimidators., 112512=\u2014 Keenyn Walker (@Keenyn_Walker) June 29, 2011, 83686=Keenyn Walker, OF, Central Arizona CC: Bats Both, 6-3, 185. Drafted by the Cubs in the 16th round in 2009 but didn\u2019t sign. Toolsy, athletic, very fast, some power potential, has strikeout issues and is still rather raw, but toolsy enough to go on first day. Committed to Utah if he doesn\u2019t sign.

Tall well proportioned build, good present strength. Tall balanced hitting stance, good balance, shows nice bat speed, ball comes off the barrel hard, solid gap power, hits under control, polished hitter who should keep improving. Good raw arm strength behind the plate, 1.93 best pop, compact release, straight back receiver, still developing footwork/quickness., 88827=MLB.com\u2019s 2009 scouting video: http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=4625607 (0:34), 81344=Walker was drafted in the 16th round out of high school in Utah in 2009 and last year at Central Arizona, in the 38th round. Scouts have always been intrigued by the 6-foot-3 switch-hitter with standout tools and impressive athleticism. The raw tools don\u2019t always translate on the baseball field, however, and he didn\u2019t even start regularly last year. This year is a different story. Walker has performed well with wood and he should get more than the $250,000 he reportedly turned down out of high school. Walker has more power from the right side, but his lefthanded swing is more pure. He\u2019s mostly a gap hitter with above-average speed, so he profiles as a good defensive center fielder. He has the speed to hit at the top of the order, but needs to cut down on his strikeouts. If he doesn\u2019t sign, Walker will head to Utah., 84506=and the June 2008 scouting report:, 80628=Bats: Switch Throws: Right Height: 6\u201903\u2033 Weight: 193 Born: 1990-08-12 Hometown: Salt Lake City,\u00a0UT Class:\u00a0 J2 (2nd year in Junior College)}",

He fell out of favor early in the year before coming on again a bit in the second half, though he had a 4.98 ERA in 22 innings through 15 appearances on the spring. Devenski ran his fastball up to 94 mph in the fall, but he\u2019s been more 90-92 and straight this spring, and there were outings when he worked in the high 80s. His slider and changeup are serviceable. Baseball America\u2019s scouting report: Devenski was assigned to Great Falls.
