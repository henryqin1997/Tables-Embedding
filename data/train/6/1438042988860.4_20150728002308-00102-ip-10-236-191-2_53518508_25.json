Davone Bess caught back-to- back passes of 10 and 21 yards to move the ball to the San Francisco 28. Lamar Miller added an 8-yard catch on 3rd-and-7 from the 15-yard line. A pair of false start penalties proved costly, and Dan Carpenter made a 28-yard field goal to make it 3-0 with 13:31 left in the half., 71479=The 49ers responded with a 13-play, 83-yard scoring drive that took almost 7 1/2 minutes off the clock. Bruce Miller kept the march alive early with a catch of two yards on 3rd-and-2. An offensive holding penalty set up 2nd- and-20. Gore caught a 19-yard pass to move the ball to the Miami 38. San Francisco went for it on 4th-and-1 and got the first down due to a defensive pass interference penalty. Gore's 19-yard run put the ball at the 1-yard line, setting up Dixon's rushing touchdown. The extra point made it 20-6 with 14:27 to play., 71285=Thigpen made up for his mistake with a 56-yard return on the ensuing kickoff. The Dolphins settled for a 53-yard Carpenter field goal, which cut the gap to 13-6 with 6:53 remaining.}",
