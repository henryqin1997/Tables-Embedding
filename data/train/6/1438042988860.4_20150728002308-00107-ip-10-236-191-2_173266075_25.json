I think all home brewers have that as well, including myself. \u00a0Anyway, so I \u00a0wanted to find a good showcase of the 3 lbs of hops I just bought. \u00a0So I made a Pale Ale back in January. \u00a0I took zero notes and it turned out fabulous. \u00a0Great, so now I have nothing to build off of, so I started over with what I thought to be the original recipe I used. \u00a0I had everything I needed already in house, Crisp Pale Ale malt, Riverbend Heritage, which is a bit darker (4-5L) than pale malt. \u00a0All I needed was the pound of Flaked Wheat. \u00a0Brew day rolls around and low and behold I forget to go get the Wheat. \u00a0Luckily I had a pound of Flaked Spelt, that I used in a pinch and I think it works., 37264=Update: 2014-06-20: Tasting Notes, 49591=One of my favorite blogs to read is Ron Pattinson\u2019s\u00a0Shut up about Barclay Perkins. \u00a0I\u2019ve been reading it for years now, I have made several of his historical recipes that get posted on his Let\u2019s Brew Wednesday topics. \u00a0Really love making these beers and trying to relive how people drank beer back in the late 1800\u2019s to all the way till after WWII. \u00a0It\u2019s always amazing to see the hopping rates, the interesting malt bills and use of different invert sugars and colorings (caramel coloring). \u00a0For this beer I had bought a whole sack (55lb) of Pauls Mild Malt almost a year ago and split it with a buddy of mine. \u00a0Having used a few pounds of it here and there, I was really looking for a way to make a beer showcasing this malt in some way. \u00a0So after some research and thought, I settled on this recipe from Barclay Perkins. \u00a0It\u2019s from 1839, so it\u2019s pretty old and pretty odd by today\u2019s standard. \u00a0There is 1 malt and 1 type of hops, well 1 type of a lot of hops. \u00a0I settled on making only a 3 gallon batch, due to the amount of malt I had on hand and I didn\u2019t want to bottle 5 gallons of this. \u00a0The bad part about this is the 4 hour boil, yeah 4 freaking hours. \u00a0I had to use 2 propane tanks to make this beer. \u00a0So I mashed in and started with a pre-boil volume like I would normally have for a 6 gallon (9 gallons) batch. \u00a0Over the 4 hours it boiled down to around 3.5 gallons. \u00a0Also adding in 2.75oz of hops for 3 gallons is a ton of hops. \u00a0So I had an issue of getting the beer out of the kettle due to all the hop matter. \u00a0Other than that, this beer is pretty normal. \u00a0It did have a starting gravity of 1.114SG and it ended at 1.024SG, and fermented pretty quickly at 65F for about a week. \u00a0It helped that I pitched a ton of yeast for the 3 gallons., 72192=Anyway my first introduction to Gose was though the Mad Fermentationist\u2019s blog post about Gose\u00a0back in 2010, since then it\u2019s really come back as a style, so much so that I believe that the BJCP\u2019s next style releases will include a Gose style category. \u00a0So I have really been wanting to make one for some time. \u00a0I had a chance to come up with a quick recipe a few weeks back hoping for a quick turn around and an easy drinking beer ready for the hotter days coming up soon. \u00a0Sadly fermentation stopped at around 1.020 and I couldn\u2019t get it started again (more on this later). \u00a0I wanted something fairly salty and somewhat sour with some Hibiscus. \u00a0So I opted for the Acid malt way of souring this beer so I wouldn\u2019t have to endure a lacto fermentation and mess up another better bottle., 60409=This one started a while back. \u00a0I wanted to somewhat clone Crooked Stave\u2019s St. Bretta but add in Blood Oranges. \u00a0I am pretty sure their Summer variant of this beer is made with Blood Oranges, but I never had the pleasure of drinking it. \u00a0So I went with a recipe pulled from the May/June 2012 Zymurgy magazine where Chad talks about brewing with 100% brett. \u00a0Their is a recipe for a 100% Brett Belgian White, which is kind of the base beer for St. Bretta which originally got it\u2019s name from his WWB series WWBO\u00a0(Orange). \u00a0WWBO is a wheat forward beer, 100% brett fermented with oranges added. \u00a0I believe everything about the orange is added, the zest, skin, pulp and juice.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Recipe Details After all of this, I ended up with 6 gallons that is already off fermenting with the WLP029\u00a0yeast I used. \u00a0I want to say that I took the recipe from the book The Home Brewers Guide to Vintage Beer\u00a0where Ron has a few pages on the style. \u00a0If you don\u2019t have this book you need it. \u00a0Now on to the recipe. For some stupid reason I thought with all the wheat I would use a single decoction method when mashing to best help break down the proteins needed for conversion. \u00a0So I mashed in at 122F for 15 minutes, pulled 40% of the grain and brought it up to 155 for 5 minutes. With this decoction I tried to leave behind as much liquid as possible. \u00a0Then boiled the decoction for 5 minutes. Added it back to the main mash. Mash temp was supposed to be 156F, but I ended up being a little low. Added in 2 gallons of boiling water to bring it up to temp. From here I batched sparged normally with 4.5 gallons of water at 185F. \u00a0This resulted in pretty good run off and extraction. \u00a0Of course I am sure some of that was due to the entire pound of rice hulls I had to use. I have been wanting to brew this style of beer for the longest time. \u00a0If you wish",
