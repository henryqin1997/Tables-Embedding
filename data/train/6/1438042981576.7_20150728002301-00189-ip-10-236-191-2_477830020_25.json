    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{42968=Other references of interest include U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,857 to Greenblatt et al. which discloses a hydrophobically-modified alkali soluble emulsion polymer which is neutralized to at least 60% of its acidic groups. The polymer contains as the hydrophobic monomer, a surfactant ester. The polymers in Greenblatt may be used as thickening agents in paints, adhesives, nonwovens, textiles, etc. Likewise, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0151886 to Bobsein et al. discloses a composition for paper coatings which contain 1) a binder copolymer and 2) a hydrophobically modified alkali-soluble emulsion polymer. U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,671 to Shay et al. discloses an alkali soluble copolymer containing a monomer with surfactant characteristics and a monomer with carboxyl functionality. Here again, the copolymers are used as thickeners. While the substantial increase in viscosity associated with water-soluble emulsion polymers is beneficial in thickening applications, it is an undesirable property in the field of nonwoven binders because the viscosity must be kept within processable limits., 111768=The emulsion polymer typically has a particle size of from 10 to 1000 nm, preferably about 50 to 300 nm. The morphology of the polymer may vary from spheres to core-shell structures, voids, half-moons, and the like. When monomers of drastically different solubility or hydrophobicity are polymerized in an emulsion process, a wide variety of morphologies may result., 114240=The viscosity of the binder solution will also depend on many factors, e.g., the monomer content of the polymer. However, regardless of the makeup of the solution, the viscosity can generally be controlled by regulating one or more of the following aspects: 1) the amount of solids content in the emulsion; 2) the molecular weight of the polymer; 3) the extent that the composition is diluted either before or after neutralization; and 4) the extent of neutralization. The viscosity of the composition should be controlled so that it may be applied to a fibrous web by normal means, and also so that the composition adequately impregnates the web, thereby at least partially binding the fibers together. Thus, the viscosity of the binder composition should be below about 2,000 cps at room temperature (23\ufffd C.). Preferably it should be below, 1000 cps, 500 cps, 200 cps and more even more preferably below 150 cps at room temperature., 78196=The polymerizable surfactant monomers are typically compositions having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functional groups, and a polymerizable group. Polymerizable groups include allyl, acryl, methallyl or methacryl groups. Suitable polymerizable surfactant monomers may include anionic surfactants such as sulphates, phosphates, sulphosuccinate half esters, and sulphosuccinate diesters bearing copolymerizable reactive groups and nonionic surfactant monomers such as nonylphenoxy propenyl polyethoxylated alcohols. Additionally, ammonium or metal salts of unsaturated C6 to C30 organic acids may be suitable; these may be used alone or in combination with the above surfactants. Suitable polymerizable surfactants are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,854 to Yokota et al., and European Patent No. 1479699, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference. Preferred polymerizable surfactants include Hitenol BC 1025 (Montello Incorporated), Trem LF-40 (a sodium dodecyl allyl sulfosuccinate surfactant available from the Henkel Corporation), and Adeka Reasoap Series Surfactants such as SR-10 (Asahi Denka Co., Ltd.). It is believed Hitenol BC and SR-10 have the following respective structures:, 227313=The binders in Examples 32-36, shown below, are polymerized into a stable emulsion using either a non-polymerizable, ether sulfate surfactant (ES-40) or a polymerizable surfactant monomer (BC 1025 or Trem LF-40). The amount of surfactant and chain transfer agent are reported as weight percent of the total non-surfactant monomer content., 103705=Surfactants have a tendency to lower the surface tension in water, which normally has a surface tension of about 73 dyne/cm. Typically, the surfactants used in the present invention reduce the surface tension of water by at least 30 percent when measured at 10% solids in water. Preferably, the surfactants reduce the surface tension of the water by at least 40, or even 50 percent when measured in 10% aqueous solutions. The surface tensions of water and 10% aqueous solutions of sodium AMPS, Hitenol BC 1025, and Hitenol BC 05 are listed in Table 2, below., 73663=The copolymers employed in the present invention are produced by emulsion polymerization. A general method for emulsion polymerization is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0164476 to Guo et al. The emulsion polymerization is typically carried out in an aqueous medium at a pH of lower than about 5.0, preferably at about 2.0 and at temperatures of less than 100\ufffd C., and preferably in the range of 40\ufffd C. to 80\ufffd C. Typically, a seeded or unseeded process is utilized to copolymerize the monomers in water with a surfactant. The polymerization occurs once the monomer and the initiator are added to the charge. The polymerization may be carried out batchwise, stepwise or continuously with batch and/or continuous addition of the monomer in the conventional manner.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the foregoing discussion, relevant knowledge in the art and references discussed above in connection with the Background and Detailed Description, the disclosures of which are all incorporated herein by reference, further description is deemed unnecessary. The above examples are intended to more fully explain the invention as defined by the claims, below. Many modifications and variations of this invention can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, increasing or decreasing the various monomer ratios can influence the tensile performance of a web, as can changing the level of neutralization. Other factors can also affect the dispersibility of a web such as the type of fibers, the structure of the substrate, and the amount of binder used. Of course, it will also be understood that the specific wet strength properties should vary depending on the desired application. The specific embodiments described herein are offered by way of example only, and the invention is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. As can be seen by Table 15, employing polymerizable emulsifiers produces binders with salt-sensitive characteristics that are equivalent to, if not superior to, non-polymerizable surfactants.",
