            "Operation Inasmuch is a really great event, where students volunteer to go help at different areas of the community for an afternoon. Its cool to see so many students gather around something that is not about themselves.",
            "Though expensive on its original price tag, most if not all students receive some type of financial aid. Carson Newman gives out a decent amount itself.",
            "Nothing like hitting up the MSAC, which has a pool, 3 court gym area, and lounges to hang out.",
            "With the Eagles Nest Cafe and the cafeteria, there are not alot of choices, but you can usually find something good to eat.",
            "Dorm life is fun. Being able to hang out with other guys and play ping pong or just hang out is usually always an option.",
            "Depending on the degree, some courses can be quite challenging, but professors are typically fair and understanding. If you put forth a good effort, teachers try to help you out.",
            "Make sure you choose a school based on more than just academics. Try to get an idea about the culture of the school and opportunities outside of the classroom.",
            "I have found Carson Newman to have been a good learning institution that realizes you can make an impact outside of the classroom. Being one of the top community-service oriented schools in the nation reveals that CN believes in impacting the community it is located in for good. Carson Newman has given me a great opportunity to move into adulthood well educated and well rounded."

The adjective private on the affiliation of the school allows the teachers to teach everything they know and all of the possible answers to what is happening in life, not just a curriculum decided by a governmental council. I have never thought about regretting my decision to come here and I hope you make the same. Am enjoying being here The students I am around are the best I could ask for. There are so many types of people that I am sure anyone can find friends. I have grown so much in m y time here and college life is the bomb. The guys on my hall have become my best friends, the college offers many intramural (casual) sports and games to play each week and there are over 100 clubs and organizations for people to choose among their interests for involvement and fellowship. Am learning a lot The professors are ranked some of the best in the country. We are not a research-based school, which means we don't have the highest payrolled teachers but it also means that the teachers are here FOR THE STUDENTS! Two of my profs took",
