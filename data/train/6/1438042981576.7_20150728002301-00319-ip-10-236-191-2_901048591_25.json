The professors are always in their offices waiting to give academic advice, proofread a paper, or to simply talk. In fact, most of my professors requested a one on one meeting just to get to know the students better. While some colleges have student professors, Westminster\u2019s professors are all highly acclaimed in their field, and they are extremely knowledgeable and capable of teaching students what they know. There are also free tutors on campus who are willing to proofread papers, help you understand a concept, or answer your questions. Knowing professors and peers are there to help makes it easy to succeed even in tough courses. This is probably why 98% of Westminster Graduates have a job or are enrolled in Grad School within a year of graduating., 118021=Go to first year events! they may sound stupid or lame (and they are), but they are also a great time to make friends. I made some of my best friends there! Also, get to know your RA on a 1:1 level, trust me they want to talk to you, and they've also probably got some experience with anything you are possibly going through., 138926=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Whether it's the students, professors, or faculty, everyone on campus will greet you with a warm smile. The college is also perfect for students who prefer a small campus. It is easy to know more people and to be known, and it's nearly impossible to get lost! There are many activities available on campus, whether you enjoy sports, music, or nature. In addition, it is also great for students who enjoy serving their community. The fraternities, sororities, and many of the other clubs provide students with opportunities to go out in the community and make a difference. The largest of these is the Habitat for Humanity group which renovates local homes. Since it is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church, there are many opportunities to get involved in Bible studies and worship",
