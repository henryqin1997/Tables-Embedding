I love school, I am transferring to University of New Mexico to continue my education., 16959=There are many things you can do for fun. There are movie theaters, golf courts, roller skating rinks, bowling, hiking, tramway rides, and many other fun activities that go on year round in the Albuquerque metro area. The balloon fiesta is always the main attraction every October. It is awesome., 289216=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 265961=I discovered this year that taking morning and night classes at CNM main campus in Albuquerque when I live in Rio Rancho is not very smart. If you are a CNM student and live more than 20 minute from main campus do not take classes first thing in the morning or after 4:30. The traffic is horrendous this time of day. Also finding parking at main campus is very tricky. Around 8 am the parking lots tend to fill up and don't start emptying until around 6-7 pm.}",

But the cost is so low that even a bad class isn't a total waste. Am enjoying being here I enjoy the class size and variety of online classes. But since my goals require a 4 year degree and Masters, I need to attend UNM to continue. Am learning a lot I have had some amazing professors here. In general this college has really challenged me and given me an education closer to what I would expect from a University, and in some cases better than you find at UNM. Login to rate or flag",
