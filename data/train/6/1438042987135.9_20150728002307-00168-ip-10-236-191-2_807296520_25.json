    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{300546=Iraq\u0092s accounts concerning the development of the R-400 bomb for BW purposes have changed since 1995. In 1995 when the personnel who conducted the programme were explaining the programme, they described it in considerable detail. There was a series of field trials using a total of six R-400 bombs, two each charged with Clostridium botulinum toxin, Bacillus subtilis and aflatoxin. Many animals were said to have been used. These field trials were reflected in the June 1996 FFCD. Subsequently, Iraq has denied that any such trials were conducted. It is very difficult to reconcile this change with very specific accounts of R-400 trials given by scientists, the attendant veterinary surgeon and workers, at what was said to be the site, namely Al-Mohammediyat. There was also a trial in August 1990 to determine the size of \u0091booster charge\u0092 charge required to disperse the agent. All attempts by Iraq to locate the exact site at Al-Hakam and find any evidence have failed., 216173=in summer 1991, 558546=16. A further component of the monitoring system has been the aerial surveillance provided by the U-2 aircraft at high altitude since August 1991, the Mirage aircraft at medium altitude since June 1998, and the helicopter surveillance provided at low altitude since June 1992. These data have been useful in ascertaining the status of declared facilities. In addition, they provide information of particular importance in identifying possible new or undeclared facilities that may have monitorable dual-use capabilities or, indeed, be engaged in proscribed activity., 406326=Field tests of BW agents started in late 1987/early 1988. The extent of such testing has not been revealed and some previously acknowledged tests are now stated not to have taken place., 550439=2. By resolution 715 (1991) of 11 October 1991, the Security Council approved the Plan for establishing such monitoring in the chemical, biological and missile areas. Under this Plan, the Special Commission established its monitoring system which is comprehensive in its approach., 548325=31. By the end of the 1998, there remained significant uncertainties in the disposition of Iraq\u0092s prohibited programmes., 9760=13. Secondly, the Commission has been obliged to undertake a degree of forensic work which was never intended to be the case. This was derived, virtually exclusively, from Iraq's inadequate disclosures, unilateral destruction and concealment activities. These actions, all of which were contrary to the resolutions, made the Commission\u0092s work more difficult and, in many cases, continued even after 1995. Had this behaviour not occurred, a far less searching inquiry by the Commission would have been necessary. The work of verification of Iraq's declarations would have and should have been far easier and should have been able to be undertaken far more quickly than has proven to be the case. Such concerted obstructions naturally raise the question of why Iraq has carried out these activities., 491877=In the years since 1995, the Commission\u0092s teams have continued to discover significant undisclosed dual-use equipment that could readily be used in a BW programme. In the six months period April to October 1998, some 150 undeclared items were found and tagged by biology monitoring teams. For example, many mobile tanks used in the BW programme are not accounted for. The significance of this lies in the fact that with only minor modifications these could be used as fermentors., 333572=Fermentor idle times: Relative to available resources, Iraq has declared less than expected production of bulk agents. Declared quantities are based on limited availability of capability such as fermentors and a shortage of specific bacterial growth components. As a proof for the limited production output Iraq claims, fermentors were not used for considerable periods of time. For example, Iraq claims lack of spare parts and a needed overhaul of some fermentors as an explanation for \"idle periods\". In fact, UNSCOM has evidence indicating spare parts were available. There is no corroborating documentation to support the less than optimal bulk agent production levels reported in the FFCD. The low production figures are particularly difficult to accept without supporting evidence during a period in mid-1990, when allegedly maximum production was ordered by Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Hassan., 332617=Fermentor usage: Iraq has calculated the quantity of agent produced by an assigned frequency and efficiency of fermentor utilization as well as assumed numbers of failed batches of agent production. For the years 1987 to 1989 there are no records to support production and the frequency and efficiency of fermentor operation is inconsistent with the overall information. Additionally, fermentors appear to have been available earlier than stated. For example, the fermentation line acquired from the Veterinary Research Laboratories (VRL) at Abu Ghraib is stated to have been acquired only late in 1988 when it was moved and installed at Al-Hakam. However, documents provided by Iraq indicated consideration of its use in situ at the VRL and spare parts for this line were ordered by the BW programme beginning late May 1988., 490276=Iraq insists that all its BW weapons were destroyed in July 1991. The numbers, location and timing of weapon destruction and, indeed, whether all weapons were destroyed, remain in doubt. Iraq\u0092s account of the destruction of the BW-filled Al-Hussein warheads changed with virtually every inspection team that addresses the issue with Iraq. No supporting evidence exists for the destruction of the bulk agent, also regarded by the Commission as weapons. Large quantities of bacterial growth media remain unaccounted for., 450976=Diagrams provided May 12, 1998. Location not known., 175059=108. In late 1995, Iraq declared that it had imported, in 1994, a large vacuum furnace without providing a notification to the Commission. According to Iraq, it ordered this equipment from a foreign supplier prior to the adoption of resolution 687 (1991) and specifically for production of engines for Al Hussein missiles. Pending results of its investigation of this illegal procurement, the Commission tagged components of the furnace and placed them under monitoring. In mid 1998, Iraq undertook to assemble the furnace and began its installation at one of its declared facilities for production of missile engines. The ongoing installation activities were under the Commission\u0092s monitoring., 242280=32. Iraq\u0092s declarations on the procurement of the production equipment used or planned to be used for the production of chemical warfare agents and their key precursors were verified by the Commission with respect to the majority of the declared items. This was achieved through field inspections, evaluation of documents provided by Iraq, and through contracts and letters of credits made available to the Commission by Iraq and the foreign suppliers. However, the verification of equipment from the latest contracts, delivered to Iraq in 1988 and 1989, was not possible due to the lack of information from the foreign suppliers., 496642=Since the disclosure of the BW programme in 1995, Iraq has released a number of documents to the Commission. Iraq has ascribed an inflated importance to certain of these documents and dismissed others. Indeed, some documents have been described as \"first class\", whilst on other occasions the same documents are described as unreliable or trivial. There is an attempt to disregard documentary evidence that contradicts the accounts of officials or material in the FFCD. It is apparent, that Iraq only releases documents and other information to address or respond to information the Commission had already become aware of., 489733=Although Iraq continues to insist that no elements of its BW programme have been preserved, the Government of Iraq has yet to offer evidence of the formal renunciation of its BW programme. It is explained that a decree was never issued because of a 1991 decision to conceal the BW programme. Again Iraq has produced no information on the decision to conceal the programme., 529893=5. In 1992, the Commission examined the evidence of the unilateral destruction available at that time and to some extent found it consistent with the rest of Iraq's programmes as then declared by Iraq. What was not recognized at the time by the Commission, was that the unilateral destruction action itself was a determined measure taken to conceal evidence which would reveal retained capabilities. Only later, when the investigations by the Commission became more searching and the Commission received reliable reports of diversions from the unilateral destruction, did it become clear that thorough verification of Iraq's claims surrounding unilateral destruction was required., 198210=destroyed during the 1991 Gulf war, 541238=19. The Commission assessed that overall direction came from a more senior entity and that this appeared to be the Special Security Organization (SSO). In late 1995, the Commission was only beginning to gain an understanding of SSO direct control over concealment actions. One example was that during interviews with the manager of the Haidar farm it was learned that the farm had been seized by officers of the SSO some ten days before the Commission was given access to it., 52021=24. The Commission's verification efforts, with respect to Iraq's declarations on combat missile launchers, have been frustrated by Iraq's misleading statements. Prior to March 1992, Iraq claimed that several imported mobile launchers had been destroyed during the Iran-Iraq war. In March 1992, it declared that those launchers had been unilaterally destroyed by Iraq in the summer of 1991. This statement was repeated in Iraq\u0092s June\u00a01996 FFCD. In the course of its follow-up verification, the Commission established that Iraq's statement on the unilateral destruction of mobile missile launchers was wrong. This finding was presented to Iraq by the Commission in July 1997. Iraq then made a new statement, in August 1997, that five imported launcher chassis had in fact been destroyed in October 1991, and not in July 1991, as had previously been declared by Iraq. A fuller explanation of Iraq's actions to retain mobile launchers after the adoption of resolution 687\u00a0(1991) and to conceal the events and timing of their unilateral destruction was requested. In September 1997, the Commission asked Iraq to explain the operational requirements for the retained proscribed missile assets that Iraq had concealed after April 1991. In response, the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq gave an explicit order, in the presence of the Executive Chairman, to the Iraqi experts not to discuss such issues with the Commission., 13133=19. In August 1998, Iraq declared that unless the Commission could demonstrate that Iraq retained prohibited items, then it must declare that Iraq had fully implemented its obligations under section C of resolution 687. This is contrary to the system established by the Council which imposed upon Iraq the obligation of full disclosure and upon the Commission the duty to verify those disclosures. Were a reversal of these obligations to be accepted, the possibility of serious error would be high as it is Iraq which controls access to the most fundamental information. The Commission remains convinced that Iraq has the capacity to provide credible information thus allowing the Commission to have confidence in an accurate declaration, when it is provided., 120038=BADR-2000 Missile System, 366093=A second loss of media is stated to have occurred during the clean up of Al-Hakam prior to UNSCOM\u0092s arrival in 1991. This was said to be an unquantified amount of media damaged during the evacuation and it is stated to have been burnt and buried at a site adjacent to Al-Hakam. This site was visited by the Commission\u0092s inspection team in 1995 and it was confirmed that media was burnt and buried there but the types and quantities are not known. During the inspection in December 1998, Iraq presented several improbable accounts of media lost, damaged and stolen that defies credibility. In conclusion therefore, the Iraqi account of lost media cannot be verified and in the case of the school house media, it is probably not true., 115647=68. Available evidence showed that Iraq continued to work on the indigenous production of proscribed missile gyroscopic instruments after April 1991. Iraq continued to receive parts for these instruments until November 1991. These items were critical to the assembly of such instruments. In 1993, a tasking to work on proscribed missile gyroscope instruments was given to a facility in Iraq that previously had been involved in their production. During the same period, Iraq also attempted to procure additional critical items for these instruments. Iraq stated that all these efforts had been very short lived. It provided no evidence or documentation to support this statement. Iraq also retained a number of original imported gyro instruments until late 1995. (For more information on these issues, see Section 3, below). All these facts could not but raise a legitimate question why it was neccessary to conduct such prohibited activities when, according to Iraq, all available proscribed imported missiles had been destroyed long ago., 357880=In the early days of Iraq\u0092s BW programme based at Al-Muthanna and Salman Pak small quantities (in the order of tens of kilograms) of media of various types were purchased by Iraq through the State Establishment for Pesticide Production (SEPP) for research and pilot scale production for BW agent. . The media, some tens of kilograms, for the initial production runs of botulinum toxin at Taji in early 1988 is stated in the FFCD to have been acquired locally but the details are not provided and it is unknown whether the amounts declared represent the totality of the amount actually acquired. No supporting documentation is provided by Iraq for any of the acquisitions referred to above., 477306=From September 1995 the Commission investigated the full programme as revealed by Iraq. Initially the inspections undertaken in the latter part of 1995 were designed to understand and get and clarify information on Iraq\u0092s weapons programmes. Subsequently, attempts were made to verify the three succeeding FFCDs produced after August 1995. During these inspections it became obvious that the FFCDs were inaccurate and incomplete and so investigation of the programme was also begun again. The focus of the inspections was the issue of weapons and the production of BW agents, together with the acquisition of bacterial growth media, weapons, and production equipment. Others aspects such as research and development still await thorough examination. Many aspects have not been addressed because Iraq refused to cooperate. The Commission attempted to help Iraq recall further information about its programme by participating in a seminar in May 1996, which dealt with chemical and biological weapons, by submitting detailed questionnaires to Iraq (which were largely ignored, although later incorporated into the 1997 FFCD), and by organizing a TEM (Vienna, March 1998) for extensive evaluation of Iraq\u0092s declarations by a full range of international experts. From June 1998, following discussions between the Commission\u0092s Executive Chairman and Mr. Tariq Aziz, Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq it was decided to adopt a focussed programme of inspections following a \"top down\" approach concentrating on establishing a material balance for biological weapons themselves. This started with an inspection concerned with weapons that concentrated on biological R-400 weapons. The decision of Iraq on 5 August 1998 to cease cooperation with the Commission on the issue of verification has meant that verification of Iraq\u0092s biological warfare programme is now in abeyance., 575889=46. In the past, the Commission has used a staff of over 200 personnel per year on a long-term basis (including experts, inspectors, policy officers, support personnel and aircrew), distributed among its three locations: Baghdad, Bahrain and New York. Although the staff was engaged in both disarmament and monitoring activities, since 1994 most of them were devoted to monitoring duties., 400806=The introduction and chronology presentation of Iraq\u0092s BW programme encompasses only a part of the programme, is inaccurate with respect to dates and fails to provide an insight into the decision making process which facilitated its evolution. The account misleads because it presents the programme as an entity which came to fruition in 1990 whereas in reality it was a programme planned to reach maturity some time in the mid/late 1990s. The account also fails to provide any perspective to the programme merely listing a miscellany of chronological events linked only by time rather than requirement, strategic planning, or military utility. As such there is no continuity to the account which limits the Commission's understanding of the BW programme., 312761=In September 1995, Iraq declared the existence of two projects concerning the use of aircraft drop-tanks to disseminate BW agents. One employed a Mirage F-1 aircraft, the other a MiG 21. The Mirage F-1 drop-tank project was said to have commenced in November 1990 when a prototype, made from a modified drop-tank, was manufactured and a series of trials undertaken. Following the last trial, just before the Gulf war, the Mirage with the prototype tank attached was left in a shelter at Abou Obeydi Airbase, near Al-Kut. Iraq states the shelter was bombed and the Mirage F-1 and its drop-tank were said to have been destroyed by fire. Three further drop-tanks were modified. This work, which appears to have been straightforward, requiring only a few days\u0092 efforts, continued throughout the period of the war at several establishments. The weapons were completed in March 1991. It is stated that these items were destroyed in summer 1991. The remains of three such tanks have been inspected. Iraq\u0092s plan was for the modification of 12 tanks in total. Iraq states that only the scarcity of a key component, an electric fuel cock, limited the number to three., 178898=114. Iraq declared that the J-1 missile had never been intended to reach proscribed ranges, and stated that the longest range achieved during the tests in 1993 was 134 kilometres. The Commission has no independent information that verifies the ranges achieved in the J-1 missile flight tests. The Commission's analysis indicates that the system, as tested, was inherently capable of reaching proscribed ranges. Given certain technical aspects associated with this project, it will be difficult to conclusively verify Iraq's declarations., 76964=44. In April 1990, Iraq established a new military unit of Brigade size (Unit 223) to be equipped with operational missile assets. One of the available Iraqi documents of April 1990 referred to a task for different organizations in Iraq to secure the needs with respect to the brigade\u0092s combat supplies (missiles, launchers and ground support). Iraq has not responded positively to the Commission\u0092s requests to provide relevant decision level documentation on the equipping of Unit 223 with combat supplies. Such documentation could significantly clarify - Iraq\u0092s planned and actual capabilities to produce indigenously and deploy, with the Army, operational missiles and related missile equipment. In response to the Commission\u0092s request of 17 November 1998, Iraq provided some 64 pages of documents related to Unit 223. This documentation did not contain the information on combat supplies sought by the Commission. It dealt with personnel and non-combat equipment like radios and cars, to be assigned to the unit and did not discuss Iraq\u0092s capabilities and actions to equip this unit with missiles, launchers and other operational assets., 78145=45. In its initial declarations in response to the requirements of resolution 687 (1991), Iraq did not disclose fully its efforts to manufacture indigenously Al Hussein class missiles or the progress it achieved. Iraq later admitted that it had a full scale programme to manufacture indigenously complete Al Hussein missiles and that it had established specialized factories for this purpose. The factories were directed, in early 1988, to plan for production of 1000 missiles. Iraq maintains that by January 1991, it had failed to produce a single operational missile., 339174=It is not possible to verify the amount of Agent C placed into munitions or warheads or otherwise consumed as presented in the 1997 FFCD. The question remains open regarding the aim and reasons of the choice of aflatoxin as an agent for BW. It is not clear what Iraq expected to obtain as a result of its use. One document refers to military requirements to produce liver cancer using aflatoxin and the efficacy against military and civilian targets. Understanding Iraq\u0092s concept of use for this agent may enhance the credibility of otherwise unsupported statements., 628742=92. Governments are the only source of personnel with technical expertise and the inspection skills required. The Commission has approached some 30 Governments with requests to provide experts for resident missile teams. Experts from 16 countries have participated in such teams since 1994. Missile technologies are limited to a few countries, the number of personnel involved in relevant industries is relatively small, generally over-employed, and very well paid. For these reasons, the Commission has found it increasingly difficult to obtain or retain qualified technical experts necessary for the ongoing monitoring in the missile area. Currently, the Commission can reliably depend on only a few Governments to provide, on a \"cost-free basis\", such personnel. In the future, the Commission will need to find additional sources of recruitment of its missile inspectors and will most probably have to bear considerable costs associated with the recruitment and training of technical experts and other inspection personnel., 208556=15. Iraq declared that 412.5 tonnes of bulk CW agents available in Iraq as of January 1991. These have been accounted for as follows:, 20884=30. An inventory of proscribed missiles that Iraq declared as destroyed unilaterally contained a reference to seven indigenously produced missiles which were in possession of the Army in 1991. No remnants which could prove such destruction, have been recovered. The Commission has not been able to verify the nature and destruction of these missiles and repeatedly requested Iraq to confirm, through physical evidence, the declared unilateral destruction of these seven missiles. The verification in this area is considered essential as it might involve operational missiles produced indigenously by Iraq. The November 1997 Emergency Session of the Commission determined that the accounting for these seven missiles was one of the priority requirements., 80887=50. In response to the requirements of resolution 687 (1991) of April 1991, Iraq did not disclose its programme to produce indigenously liquid propellant engines for proscribed missiles. In October 1991, Iraq stated that it had a limited, unsuccessful effort within its Project 1728 for the reverse engineering of proscribed missile engines and had imported some components and equipment for that purpose. For years, Iraq insisted that the main purpose of Project 1728 had not been missile production, but the development of welding and other technologies for manufacturing agricultural pumps., 214237=242 tonnes were declared by Iraq as having been destroyed unilaterally in the summer of 1991. These include all precursors for the production of VX. The declared destruction of these 242 tonnes of key precursors was only partly accounted for., 64108=The 30 CW combat warheads (16 filled with sarin and 14 with the alcohol component) were destroyed under UNSCOM supervision in 1991-1993. Iraq\u0092s declarations on the disposal of the remaining 45 combat special warheads out of the 75 declared as produced, stated that they had been unilaterally destroyed in early July 1991. The assessment of the warhead remnants excavated since August 1997 allows for the identification of 43-45 special warheads coming from the sites of the declared unilateral destruction., 187970=10. With respect to the munitions which existed as of January 1991, Iraq declared 127,941 filled and unfilled special munitions. These munitions have been declared by Iraq and accounted for by the Commission as follows:, 31061=2. The inadequacy of Iraq's initial declarations was one of the elements leading to the adoption of Security Council resolution 707 (1991) of 15\u00a0August\u00a01991, in which the Council, inter alia, demanded that Iraq provide full, final and complete disclosure (FFCD), as required by resolution 687 (1991), of all aspects of its programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometres, and of all holdings of such weapons, their components and production facilities and locations., 230199=25. Prior to 1986, the majority of precursors for the production of CW agents were procured by Iraq from abroad. In the period 1985-1990, Iraq constructed three facilities (Fallujah 1, 2 and 3) and new production plants at MSE to produce indigenously CW precursor chemicals (PCl 3, POCl 3, SOCl 2 and TMP)., 360817=Iraq had stated that in June 1991, before the arrival of the first UNSCOM BW team, the media remaining at Al-Hakam was transferred to the State Company for Drugs and Medical Appliances Marketing (otherwise known as Kimadia) within the Ministry of Health. Iraq has explained that the role of Kimadia was to provide a cover story for media that had been consumed in the weapons programme. Subsequently documentation was drawn up to indicate that media consumed in the programme had been sent to hospitals in outlying regions where riots had occurred and hence would no longer be traceable., 213125=20. Iraq declared that 3,915 tonnes of key precursors remained in Iraq as of January 1991. According to Iraq, the discrepancy between calculated quantities of precursors left over from the production of CW agents (5,650 tonnes) and quantities of precursors declared by Iraq as remaining in January 1991 (3,915 tonnes) could have occurred due to the lack of sufficient information and full records on the actual delivery by former suppliers, on the consumption of precursors in the production of CW agents, and on the losses of key precursors, including through unsuitable storage, spillage, leakage etc., 25784=35. The degree of verification achieved is not satisfactory. Iraq declared that it had produced a total of 3.9 tonnes of VX. Iraq provided documents on production in 1988, but failed to provide verifiable evidence for its activities in 1990. Iraq also denies that it weaponized VX. Sampling by the Commission of special warheads has thrown significant doubt upon this claim. Iraq needs to provide verifiable evidence and clarifications to support its declarations on the production and weaponization of VX. Technical meetings with the Iraqi specialists and field verification are required., 494977=A high-ranking Iraqi official, Lt. Gen. Amer Al-Saadi, stated in 1998, that Iraq offers no defence for the period of denial of its BW programme. He admitted it was a political decision to conceal both the programme and consequently its obliteration from the Special Commission. In fact, the attempts to conceal the programme caused and continue to cause serious doubts amongst the Commission\u0092s experts over Iraq's declarations. This and a lack of documentary or other physical evidence greatly hinders the process of verification of Iraq\u0092s disarmament efforts to which it is obligated by international law and its own acceptance of those terms., 486925=The Commission could not make an accurate technical assessment of Iraq\u0092s scientific, industrial, and technical accomplishments because Iraq has not been transparent in its FFCD nor its clarifications about the BW programme. Since the programme has operated from 1973, it is reasonable to assume that Iraq attempted considerably more than has been revealed and that some components achieved success in areas not revealed to the Commission. Some 400 individuals are known to have contributed to the programme in various ways from research to weaponization. Civilians, civil servants, security, and military personnel were involved. Iraq has a record of denying and understating its weapons programmes. Iraq has preserved components of its BW programme since 1991, and much of the expertise remains in Iraq. The Commission has examined the indigenous capability existing in Iraq and has assessed in the course of inspection that Iraq is capable of manufacturing \"dual use\" equipment and munitions. The degree of sophistication of these systems may not meet so called \"western\" standards but none the less are quite capable of fulfilling the requirements., 514059=Since the adoption of SCR 687 (1991), in April 1991, and until July 1995, Iraq denied that it had any proscribed BW activities. Despite Iraq\u0092s denial, the Commission, through its inspection and verification procedures, was able to determine that Iraq had not provided a full and comprehensive disclosure of its biological programme nor had it accounted for items and materials acquired for that programme. The Commission reported these findings to the Security Council in April 1995. On 1 July, 1995, Iraq acknowledged that it had had an offensive BW programme, but denied weaponization. Subsequently, in August 1995, after the departure of Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Hassan, Iraq admitted that it had weaponized BW agents and had deployed them for combat use. However, the Commission has a far from complete understanding of all aspects of Iraq's BW programme. The Biological FFCD neither contains the required detail, nor does it cover the full scope of Iraq\u0092s BW activities. In particular, a refusal to disclose, or even discuss, details of the military aspects of the BW programme is of concern., 677682=12. Protocol building or baseline inspections of sites in Iraq were undertaken during the summer of 1994. Prior to April 1995, an interim monitoring process was put in place. This process was in preparation for biological monitoring, which began in April 1995. The Commission evaluated dual purpose technologies, activities, materials, items and equipment which could contribute to a biological warfare capability and identified those sites or facilities that through possession of such characteristics could contribute to such a capability. Protocols outline the basic facts of the site, the reason for OMV, a general description of areas, equipment, technologies and activities of interest under OMV, site diagrams, maps, previous inspection findings and inspection procedures and assessment of the dual-use capability of the facility. These protocols are continuously updated by the Commission., 467056=The account of military organizations involved in the BW programme is not seriously addressed in the FFCD. The contention that the MOD remained wholly unaware of Iraq's BW programme since 1987 is implausible. The programme started within the Al-Hazen Institute and was headed by a member of the Chemical Corps, Major Ibrahim Ghazim, and the biological component had two senior members recruited from the Chemical Corps. It is acknowledged that MOD was involved from 1983 to 1987 and that it endorsed the addition of BW to the remit of Al-Muthanna in 1983. Although, formally, the chain of command may have altered when the BW research and production component was transferred to TRC within MIC in 1987, it is unlikely that it was not visible to senior military personnel within the MOD. Programming for the formal adoption of BW would have been a factor in the strategic planning of Iraq's military development along with the foreseen nuclear and chemical capabilities., 556521=13. Following Iraq\u0092s acknowledgement of resolution 715 (1991), the Commission, the IAEA and the Committee established pursuant to resolution 661 (1990) (the \"Sanctions Committee\") developed a mechanism for the monitoring of any future sales or supplies by other countries to Iraq of items relevant to the implementation of section C of resolution 687 (1991) and other relevant resolutions. The lists of such items are contained in Annexes to the Commission\u0092s and the IAEA\u0092s Plans for OMV. Following consultations with States with export control experience, a report on provisions for a mechanism for Export/Import Monitoring was transmitted to the Security Council on 7 December 1995. On 27 March 1996, the Security Council adopted resolution 1051 (1996) which approved the provisions of the mechanism. A Joint IAEA-UNSCOM Unit was established in New York to run the mechanism and a corresponding office and resident monitoring team established in the BMVC., 350996=1120 litres, 93801=53. No significant quantities of missile components for indigenous production of proscribed missiles were presented by Iraq for destruction in accordance with the requirements of resolution 687 (1991). Iraq declared that practically all of the imported missile engine components, which remained at the time of the adoption of resolution 687 (1991) in April 1991, had been secretly destroyed either by explosion in the desert or by melting in foundries. These unilateral destruction activities were claimed to have occurred from July to November 1991 and were declared by Iraq for the first time in March 1992. Based on the evidence presented by Iraq and the lack of supporting documentation at that time, the Commission was not able to verify the quantities of proscribed items declared as unilaterally destroyed. The Commission also assessed that not all items, declared by Iraq to have been unilaterally destroyed in 1991, had in fact been destroyed as declared., 615511=66. As missile related activities progressed in Iraq, the Commission began to put more effort into technical evaluation of Iraq\u0092s declared missile systems and their components. At the end of 1997, several specific issues for technical assessment of the Samoud missile were identified. The Commission resorted to additional technical instrumentation for independent and precise appraisal of specific missile parameters both through physical measurement and mathematical modelling. This called for the use of such instrumentation as precision scales and precision volumetric gauges. These were necessary to verify that declared missile characteristics such as weights of individual missile sub-systems and sections, volumes of propellant loads and matching parameters of the missiles actually used in tests. Such data is essential for verification that the declared system as a whole complies in practice with the Plan for OMV., 53480=25. Iraq declared that it had imported 819 combat warheads for proscribed missiles of SCUD/Al Hussein class and that 121 combat warheads of the same type had been produced indigenously or had been under production at the time of adoption of resolution 687 (1991). Iraq\u0092s declarations on the material balance in this area have changed several times. Table 3 provides a summary of the material balance of declared warheads based on Iraq\u0092s most recent declarations of 1998., 282225=The Commission presented to the Security Council outstanding issues and sought to establish a programme of work that would enable outstanding issues to be resolved. In biology the priority concerns were: the production of materials and equipment; agents; munitions, and their possible destruction. Additional requirements from Iraq were the provision of the information and materials identified by the TEM. The Commission subsequently met with the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq in June and agreed on a schedule of work for the next two months. As part of the schedule of work it was agreed, at Iraq\u0092s request, to reconvene the international experts to discuss again, with a broad range of Iraqi experts the overall problems associated with the biological FFCD., 337458=Aflatoxin, Agent C: Declared production of the BW agent aflatoxin could not have occurred using the process stated by Iraq. In its June 1996 FFCD, Iraq claimed that, in September 1990, it had zero balance on hand, having produced only 40 litres of aflatoxin that were nearly all consumed by weapons field trials. Assessments by the Commission show that the quantity produced would have been inadequate for the declared number of field trials. Iraq claimed to have produced 1,782 litres of aflatoxin for filling weapons from 1 October to 31 December 1990 and continued the production two weeks into January 1991 for an additional 119 litres. Taking into account the technology, organization and production limitations including facilities, equipment, and personnel available, such large production volumes are doubtful. The impact on production of aflatoxin of mixing CS, CN, and smut spores with aflatoxin is not clear. A new account of aflatoxin production and weaponization is contained in the September 1997 FFCD, but the changes are not adequately explained or supported by documentary evidence. The new account is no more credible than the June 1996 version. Iraq has not offered any credible explanations to support its statements other than the 1990 Al-Hakam report that cites 2200 litres produced without the details of where and how it was produced. During an inspection in July 1998, Iraq tried to establish among themselves the figures of aflatoxin produced, indicative of Iraq\u0092s uncertainty with aflatoxin production quantities., 168002=100. Evidence available to the Commission shows that during the same period of time, in 1993, Iraq attempted to procure from abroad guidance components for proscribed Al Hussein missiles. This poses the obvious question why there was a need to procure, in 1993, components specifically used in proscribed missiles when all such missiles had been allegedly destroyed in 1991. A missile facility in Iraq signed a contract with a foreign middleman to acquire a key component (potentiometers) for proscribed SCUD-B/Al Hussein gyroscopes that Iraq stated it was not able to produce or procure before the Gulf war. Under the contact, the middleman purchased and brought to Iraq a number of components and samples of proscribed missile gyroscopes. According to Iraq, its officials learned of the content of the shipment and ordered it to be removed from the country. They warned missile establishments in Iraq not to deal further with this middleman. The shipment was declared removed from Iraq in May 1994. The Commission was not able to verify the content of the shipment nor its removal from Iraq., 201034=2) In 1995, documentary evidence was provided by Iraq that 36,500 rockets had been stored at a facility destroyed during the Gulf war., 185066=5. Iraq' s declarations cover the organizational structure of its CW-programme, procurement and R&D activities, holdings of CW, their components and production facilities during the entire period of the implementation of the CW programme, as well as their consumption. When UNSCOM began its verification activities in 1991, only part of Iraq' s previous CW stocks, their components and production facilities remained in Iraq. According to Iraq, more than 50% of its CW stocks were consumed in the 1980s. About 70% of the CW key precursors obtained by Iraq were used, according to Iraq, for the manufacture of CW agents, both consumed and those remaining in 1991., 652392=30. The Commission has had a chemical laboratory at the BMVC since 1995. This laboratory is equipped with suitable analytical instruments (Gas Chromatography, Mass Spectroscopy, Infrared Spectroscopy etc.). Its main task is to analyze air samples taken at various sites by the Commission\u0092s automated air samplers. The character of this laboratory is designed to conduct routine analyses of chemical samples taken for verification purposes. The laboratory continues to be upgraded., 475306=From September 1994 to July 1995 it became obvious that Iraq was failing to disclose a programme from the inconsistent, often conflicting and changing stories, presented without any substantiation. Eventually the failure of Iraq to account credibly for the vast amount of media imported between 1988 and 1990 led to the acknowledgment that Iraq, indeed, had produced industrial scale quantities of a significant military programme of two biological warfare agents (Bacillus anthracis spores and Clostridium botulinum toxin) although it was stated, incredibly, that this was done with no thought of weaponization., 404174=Research and Development at Al-Muthanna is claimed to have been restricted to consideration of just Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus anthracis spores whereas it is known that Clostridium perfringens was received on 10 November 1986 and that \"DIALOG\" database searches were undertaken for Clostridium perfringens on 13 May 1985 and 10 July 1985. Consultations were undertaken with Prof. Nasser Hindawi when at Mustansiriyah University in 1986., 531293=7. The Commission has conducted extensive examination of Iraq's claims concerning the period, July 1991, when Iraq stated that so much of its weapons programmes were secretly eliminated. The material balance and verification of Iraq's claims concerning the disposition of weapons in all areas (missiles, biological and chemical weapons) rests on accepting Iraq's declarations at face value. The Commission has conducted extensive excavation efforts with Iraq at places Iraq declared to have been the locations of explosive demolitions of proscribed weapons and burials of destroyed remnants. Extensive interviews with Iraqi participants in the unilateral destruction have also been conducted. Analysis of overhead imagery of that period has been made. The results have been mixed with some evidence supporting Iraqi declarations. Other data raises serious concerns about the true fate of proscribed weapons and items., 262162=Supporting documentation is generally lacking. Iraq explains that this was because a decision was made in 1991 that all documents relating to the BW programme were to be destroyed. After the departure of Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Hassan in August 1995, the Commission was told that some documents had however been saved and about 200 documents relating to the BW programme were recovered by the Commission from buildings at the Haidar Farm. Most of these documents related to research and did not add a great deal to the Commission\u0092s overall understanding of the programme. In addition to these documents, since 1995 and after much prompting by the Commission, Iraq has provided a number of additional documents of variable quality. Most of them are peripheral to the verification process and are open to various assessments. Thus, except in some limited areas, documentation provided by Iraq is grossly inadequate for verification purposes., 201593=2) In July 1998, Iraq provided a progress report on its ongoing internal investigation., 243867=35. Iraq provided declarations on its chemical warfare agents and chemical munitions related R&D activities and their results. Some of these declarations were supported by the documentation provided by Iraq. In addition, in the files admitted by Iraq at the Haidar farm (\"Chicken Farm\") in August 1995 the Commission found many R&D reports which supported Iraq\u0092s declarations. As a result, the Commission has a good understanding of the extent of Iraqi research on the types of CW produced by Iraq in quantities. These include the following chemical warfare agents and munitions: mustard, tabun, sarin, CS, 122-mm rocket, 155-mm shell, BR-250, BR-500, LD-250, AALD-500, R-400, DB-2 aerial bombs and special warheads for the Al-Hussein missiles., 163158=93. After the adoption of resolution 687 (1991), Iraq also retained specialized tooling and fixtures that had been used with production equipment for proscribed missile production. Only after the submission of its latest FFCD in the missile area in June 1996 and after the Commission presented its evidence, did Iraq declare that \"most important\" tooling for missile production equipment - in particular, for proscribed Al Hussein missile airframe and engine manufacturing - had been purposefully diverted from the earlier declared July 1991 unilateral destruction. According to Iraq, these tools and some missile components were then buried at a site of the Special Republican Guard in a manner such that they would be preserved for future use. Iraq claimed that the tooling hidden at this site had been excavated secretly by Iraqi personnel in March 1992 and had been subsequently unilaterally destroyed., 541721=20. This period of interviews and analysis led the Commission to investigate further the involvement of relevant security organizations in ongoing activities of a proscribed nature. The technique of interviewing participants in known concealment events proved useful even when interviewees were heavily coached. During the spring of 1996, continued interview and investigation missions were conducted in Iraq with the goal of eliciting a true picture of concealment actions and confirmation that it had or would be ended. In addition, acting on information developed during late 1995, the Commission conducted an inspection of sites related to concealment activities. This inspection was conducted in March 1996 and resulted in several refusals by Iraq to provide access to sites in accordance with its obligations., 545603=26. In August and September 1997, two inspections were conducted in an effort to uncover Iraq's efforts to deceive the Commission in the CW and BW areas. This reflected a decision to broaden the scope of the investigation aimed at thwarting Iraq's concealment efforts. During these inspections the same techniques of convoy movements occurred in direct reaction to the Commission's inspection activity. This provided still more evidence that concealment was ongoing., 493992=In April 1991, Iraq made a decision to conceal certain aspects of its weapons of mass destruction programmes from the world. With regard to its BW programme it decided to admit only a limited effort of research and development, that was restricted to a single location, never reached the level of production of agent or weaponization, and was terminated unilaterally in August 1990. Iraq maintained this position until in 1995, when the departure of the head of Iraq\u0092s weapons of mass destruction programs, resulted in additional aspects of these activities being released. Iraq admitted having had an offensive programme centred around a purpose built research and production facility and including large scale production of BW agents and weaponization and deployment of aerial bombs and long-range warheads., 190462=11. The material balance of 127,941 unfilled and filled special munitions declared by Iraq remaining as of January 1991 is provided in table l., 576458=48. The majority of the Commission\u0092s personnel has been provided by governments (as proposed by the Secretary-General and endorsed by the Security Council in 1991 - S/22508). United Nations staff have also been seconded to the Commission. As the Council agreed in 1991, the Member States whose nationals serve on the Commission or assist it in the discharge of its responsibilities have been responsible for their salaries, while the Commission has borne the costs of travel and daily subsistence. These arrangements have helped to keep the overall budget of the Commission to a minimum., 66133=31. Iraq described in detail the procedures and methods of unilateral destruction of the special warheads by explosive demolition. After examination of the relevant destruction sites and the special warhead remnants recovered from them, the Commission found that Iraq\u0092s explanations were, in general, plausible. However, in one aspect dealing with the destruction of BW warheads, the Commission, after consulting a group of international experts, assessed that Iraq\u0092s declaration that 15 warheads had been destroyed simultaneously conflicted with physical evidence collected at the declared location of their unilateral destruction. This finding indicated that not all BW warheads had been destroyed at the same time as declared by Iraq and that Iraq had retained some BW warheads after the declared July 1991 unilateral destruction date. The discrepancies between Iraq\u0092s current declarations on its unilateral destruction of the special warheads and the physical evidence collected at the destruction site need to be clarified. In addition, the Commission\u0092s investigations showed that Iraq had not provided the true locations of the hiding, prior to the declared unilateral destruction, of at least half of the special warheads including the abovementioned 15 BW warheads. In December 1998, Iraq again identified new locations of storage pits from where the warheads had been moved to the unilateral destruction sites. The Commission could not again confirm that the newly identified locations had been used for hiding warheads. Iraq\u0092s continuous inability to disclose hide sites of the special warheads has also prevented the Commission\u0092s verification of declared unilateral destruction of the special warheads., 1545=Letter dated 25 January 1999 from the Executive Chairman of the, 709674=43. The Commission currently operates facilities in Baghdad, in Bahrain, and at the headquarters in New York. The facility in Baghdad is designed to house all of the services required by the resident and non-resident inspection teams for both the Commission and the IAEA, including, inter alia, office space, transportation, computer support, medical services, communications (including remote camera monitoring), storage, training, vehicle maintenance and administration. The Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Centre (BMVC) has been in operation since August 1994. The BMVC is located in the Canal building along with several other United Nations organizations. On several occasions since October 1994, the Commission has been forced to expand its use of the facility, at the expense of these other United Nations organizations, in order to meet its mission requirements. The BMVC\u0092s current office space in the Canal building is barely meeting the Commission\u0092s and the IAEA\u0092s requirements., 193159=2) Remnants of several hundred destroyed aerial bombs from 438 bombs declared by Iraq as destroyed in a fire accident in 1988, were seen by UNSCOM., 247179=40. With the exception of a firing table for one type of 122-mm rocket found in the files from the Haider farm, no other firing and bombing tables for other types of special munitions have been seen by the Commission. According to Iraq, all these documents were destroyed by Iraq in 1991., 172316=105. Iraq declared that work on the 7-ton thrust missile engine had only started in June 1995. Such an engine could increase substantially the propulsive force of the then-declared missile system under development, which already had a range just below the permitted threshold of 150 kilometres. The engineer involved in the project claimed to have no knowledge of the purpose of the development of the new engine. He stated that no designs had been completed. No documentation has been provided by Iraq regarding these activities., 604447=45. In response to these events and Iraq\u0092s recent improvements in its non-proscribed missile related capabilities, the Commission began a process of a basic review of missile design, development and production activities in Iraq at their new levels. The goal is to maintain the Commission\u0092s ability to monitor effectively Iraq\u0092s activities. The Commission conducted new baseline inspections related to missile and dual-use production equipment at the end of 1997, and Iraq\u0092s solid propellant missile industry in the middle of 1998. Resultant assessments and recommendations are being incorporated into the monitoring system. Additional baseline inspections are still required to bring the current monitoring system up to speed., 546077=27. In a further effort to continue to press Iraq to fully declare its programmes, the Commission reconfigured its concealment investigation work. Another mission went into Iraq in September 1997. Limited progress was made in obtaining Iraq's acknowledgment of Special Republican Guard and Mukhabarat involvement. At that time, another inspection obtained an SSO document related to dual-use biological activities and materials. A follow-on inspection was denied access to an SSO site in a presidential area., 402439=The Al-Hazen Institute terminated on 16 January 1979 not 1978, as declared, because of fraud by the Chairman (Major Ghazan Ibrahim, not stated in the FFCD) and some senior staff, not for reasons of inadequacy of the facility, nor inability to make scientific progress as claimed by Iraq., 172854=106. At the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995, an order was issued to design a multi-stage Space Launch Vehicle capable of placing a small satellite into a very low orbit. Such a missile system would be capable of carrying weapon payloads far beyond permitted ranges. According to Iraq\u0092s declarations, missile establishments started a feasibility study. Several designs based on Volga/SA2 surface-to-air missiles were simulated. The report on this study was prepared in February 1995, concluding that the idea was not feasible given the capabilities available to Iraq. Allegedly the project was stopped shortly thereafter. This project was declared to the Commission in August 1995. Simulations of the system\u0092s trajectory, some minutes of meetings and a portion of the final report were provided by Iraq as supporting evidence. The chief engineer involved in the project stated that he knew at the time that this subject was prohibited by the United Nations and that clustering and multi-stage techniques as well as separation techniques were proscribed under resolution 715 (1991)., 179443=115. Available evidence revealed that after the adoption of resolution 687 (1991), Iraq operated in secrecy a facility for the production of liquid propellant missile engines. The facility known as the Sadiq factory was established by a team from Project 1728 (production of proscribed Al Hussein missile engines). The facility\u0092s activity was not declared to the Commission until December 1995. Iraq stated that the work on liquid propulsion missile engines began in early 1992. This effort was declared as directed at the reverse-engineering and production of the Volga/SA2 missile engine as well as the manufacture of certain components such as missile engine shut-off valves, which the original Volga/SA2 engine did not have, but which are required for a surface-to-surface ballistic missile. Specific measure were taken to conceal this effort from inspection teams., 358746=In late 1987 and early 1988, enquiries, and ultimately orders, were made for large purchases of media. Iraq acknowledges importing over 40 tons of media in 1988 and although no documentation is provided by Iraq. The Commission can confirm the four largest orders listed in the FFCD. However, the Commission has information that shows that the bulk media acquisitions as declared by Iraq are an incomplete listing and that further amounts in excess of 600 kg were imported and have not been declared. Furthermore, some of this undeclared media was received by Iraq prior to May 1988, suggesting that the statement in the FFCD that the Taji fermentor was shut down between April and July 1988 \"due to the non availability of culture media\", is incorrect., 132669=77. In response to resolution 687 (1991), Iraq declared a project to develop a gun intended to fire rocket assisted projectiles with ranges of over 150 kilometers. In 1988, Iraq contracted a foreign company for the design of such \"superguns\". Components were procured by Iraq for guns with a caliber of 350mm and 1000mm. Iraq conducted several trials of the 350mm guns using lead projectiles. Iraq claimed that it had never received any design, assistance, materials or equipment for rocket associated projectiles., 546594=28. In January 1998, an inspection to conduct a concealment investigation was sent to Iraq. It was stopped by Iraq after one day., 539451=17. In its first phase, the analysis of the Chicken Farm documents was carried out and the implications of the retained and sustained prohibited programmes were examined. The Commission concluded that multiple organizations in Iraq had to be involved. The concealment and deception activities had distinct technical requirements. This implied, inter alia, the continued involvement of the Military Industrial Commission (MIC). Iraq acknowledged this. However, covert procurement required an overseas presence and the establishment of front companies. These activities had been conducted by the General Intelligence Service, the Mukhabarat, during the 1980's and its expertise would continue to be valuable. Analysis of how procurement was conducted in the period immediately prior to the Gulf war was conducted as a possible indicator of how Iraq would continue such efforts to the present. This simple, logical analysis bore fruit. The Commission soon had direct evidence of Mukhabarat involvement when long range missile gyroscopes, accelerometers and test equipment were discovered being imported into Iraq in 1995., 45086=18. In July 1991, the Commission supervised the destruction of 9 Fahad missiles. Fahad missiles were Volga/SA2 surface-to-air missiles that Iraq modified for a surface-to-surface application, with ranges over 150 kilometres. Twenty-one flight tests of Fahad missiles were declared to have been conducted by Iraq before the Gulf War. No supporting documentation has been provided by Iraq to ascertain how many such missiles were modified. Unmodified Volga missiles declared by Iraq in 1996 are currently under the Commission's monitoring in order to ensure their non-modification for a surface-to-surface application or for delivery of non-conventional warheads., 117101=70. Iraq declared that it has not used its nitric acid production facility to manufacture oxidizer for Al Hussein class missiles. It had instead engaged in \"refurbishment\" of residues of the imported oxidizer (AK27I) remaining in storage tanks after the fuelling of missiles. According to Iraq, this \"refurbishment\" process was conducted during 1990 and some 55 tanks of oxidizer residues, i.e., over 150 tonnes of oxidizer, had been collected. Iraq stated that most of the \"regenerated\" oxidizer did not pass acceptance tests. No evidence has been provided by Iraq to substantiate its declarations. Iraq declared that \"regenerated\" oxidizer produced and \"non-regenerated\" oxidizer collected were destroyed unilaterally in August 1991 together with other propellants for SCUD-B/Al Hussein class missiles., 213737=21. 3,915 tonnes of key precursors remaining in January 1991 have been accounted for as follows:, 132126=76. Through its verification and assessments, the Commission has come to the conclusion that Iraq had not received complete operational BADR 2000 missiles nor other assets required for the operational use of such missiles. The facilities specifically dedicated to BADR 2000 missile production and testing were destroyed or rendered harmless under the Commission\u0092s supervision. What remains of these facilities is currently under the Commission\u0092s monitoring as a part of the on-going monitoring in Iraq., 303947=The 1997 biological FFCD omits, or does not substantiate, many aspects of the R-400 programme, such as quantitative aspects of filling weapons, location and timing of filling, storage, deployment and destruction of weapons and military deployment or use. Photographic evidence shows that biological R-400 bombs were at an undisclosed site in October 1991, which is after Iraq claims that the BW programme had been \"obliterated\". This is of particular concern as it affects the credence of the account of R-400 weapons in the FFCD. The total number of R-400 bombs that would have been available for filling is not known., 552649=6. The process of implementing the system involved a number of key tasks. The first required Iraq to provide information on sites having dual use capabilities as well as sites known to have been involved in prohibited weapons programmes. In early 1994, detailed formats for the provision of data relevant to ascertaining the capabilities and future monitoring of such sites were created and passed to the Iraqi counterparts for completion. Iraq provided data on identified sites. Throughout 1994, baseline survey missions were conducted by visiting teams of experts to sites in Iraq. These activities had, as their goal, the design and implementation of monitoring at each site and the creation of protocols for their monitoring., 205893=3) In 1998, degradation products of CW agent VX were found on some of the remnants of special warheads., 535045=12. Further investigation of this \"diversion\" from the unilateral destruction raised further questions, which remain unanswered. According to Iraq, some material now acknowledged to have been diverted from unilateral destruction came from a site called al Alam. Iraq stated that ten vehicles containing prohibited missile items were sent to this remote location in July 1991. The Commission examined imagery of this area during that time-frame and found not just ten vehicles, but that there had been over 100 vehicles present at this remote location. No explanation of the remaining 90 vehicles has been received from Iraq. Requests by the Commission for documents concerning this movement of vehicles either through Special Security checkpoints or vehicle movement logs have been rebuffed by Iraq with the claim that no documents are available. On the last occasion that this issue was discussed with senior Iraqi officials, in July 1998, Iraq conceded that for the preceding two years it had mislead the Commission concerning the events of the unilateral destruction of components for its indigenous missile engine programme., 472375=Inspections 1991 to 1998, 200377=2) In the period 1991-1998, remnants of about 4,000 rockets were recovered and accounted for by UNSCOM., 249645=46. It should be recalled, that a significant number of chemical weapons, their components, related equipment and materials were identified and destroyed under the Commission\u0092s supervision in the period from 1991 to 1997. This included over 38,000 filled and unfilled chemical munitions, 690 tonnes of chemical warfare agents (including 411 tonnes of bulk agents), more than 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals and about 600 pieces of production equipment., 95710=55. The Commission conducted a number of inspections to recover indigenous missile engine components from destruction and burial sites identified by Iraq. This was done in an attempt to verify declared material balances of these components. After a first round when far fewer items had been recovered than had been listed in the documents, Iraq stated that most of the missing items had been re-excavated unilaterally by Iraq in April or May 1992 and taken to foundries for melting. The Commission, then, conducted an inspection to identify ingots and other remnants resulting from the unilateral destruction activities in an effort to establish at least a rough material balance by aggregate weight of melted materials. Again, when insufficient material was recovered to account for the declared destruction of missile engine components, Iraq provided new explanations that, in fact, it had dumped the items that were missing from the accounting, into various rivers. In July 1998, the Commission conducted an inspection to recover these items., 279186=On each occasion the experts unanimously considered Iraq's FFCD presented an inadequate, inaccurate account with deficiencies in all areas. Iraq\u0092s latest biological FFCD (submitted in September 1997) is not complete and fails to present a coherent, technically detailed, overall account. The shortcomings occurred not only in areas directly concerned with the material balance (e.g., weapons, bulk-agent products, and microbiological growth media), but also in all other areas (e.g., history, planning, acquisition, research and development). The TEM team also concluded that the FFCD had substantial deficiencies in all areas and Iraq's account of its BW programme could not be verified as a \u0091full and complete disclosure\u0092, as required by the Security Council. Iraq provided many explanations for the account in the FFCD but was unable to substantiate most of its disclosure, and was unwilling to add the missing components. In July 1998, another international team concluded the FFCD, in its present state, could not be verified as complete and accurate., 602952=43. In order to establish its current monitoring system in Iraq, the Commission conducted, in early 1994, baseline site inspections. They mostly covered Iraq\u0092s declared missile research, development, testing and production facilities, and declared dual-use facilities. The objective was to determine specific requirements for monitoring procedures for each site. During an initial round of baseline inspections, 33 facilities were inspected to assess the level of technical capabilities of each facility related to both proscribed and non-proscribed missile activities, follow the production process at each facility, identify requirements for tagging and remote camera surveillance and elaborate specific details for Iraq\u0092s declarations regarding each facility. All 33 facilities inspected were included in the site list in the missile area. The baseline inspections also assessed the overall status of each of the indigenous missile programmes declared by Iraq under the Plan for OMV., 403509=It is stated by Iraq that no plans were elaborated for the large scale production, weaponization and storage of BW agents which is contrary to the statement of Gen. Nizar Attar who stated in 1995 that a plan was formulated in 1986 to achieve weaponization within 5 years (which is precisely what happened). The evolution of the programme over the next five years appears to follow a well defined course implemented with urgency, authority, and great secrecy demonstrating considerable planning., 285160=The FFCD presents a limited account that deals only with some components of the programme uncovered during the Commission\u0092s investigations. Iraq states that it \u0091obliterated\u0092 the BW programme in 1991, claiming that this involved the destruction of all its BW weapons and associated records and documents. This has greatly complicated the determination of the material balance, and thus hindered verification. The FFCD portrays a programme designed to culminate in January 1991, suggesting that no plans existed beyond that time. In reality the programme was a continuing one, with objectives stretching well into the future. The statement that the programme was \u0091obliterated\u0092 in 1991 is contradicted by later evidence of deception and concealment. This activity continued until 1995, at least, and one of the aims could have been the preservation of essential components of the BW programme. Indeed, Iraq, after 1991, retained suitable growth media, BW facilities, production equipment, teams of expert personnel, and the essential technical knowledge., 398327=Not all strains of micro-organisms that were acquired bu\\y Iraq are included nor are all attempted acquisitions of strains included. The FFCD contains only the Vollum strain of Bacillus anthracis spores to be obtained by TSMID, in 1989, but in 1988 an Iraqi scientist involved in the BW programme had tried to obtain known BW and other virulent Bacillus anthracis spores strains from outside Iraq. All local acquisitions of strains are not included in the FFCD. Further, the fungal and viral strains acquired are not reported in the FFCD., 543835=23. The Commission sent three additional investigation missions to Iraq during the remainder of 1996. Interviews were conducted and considerable discussion about the disposition of documentation took place. Little substantive progress was made. The Commission also continued to receive information about retained prohibited material in Iraq during this period. All information continued to support SSO/Special Republican Guard involvement., 490970=After 1991, Iraq maintained and expanded the purpose-built major BW production, research and development and storage facility, Al-Hakam. From that time, Iraq asserts that Al-Hakam was solely a single cell protein (SCP) production plant. However, no serious attempts to produce SCP ever occurred. SCP was only produced in insignificant quantities as a camouflage, principally by harvesting SCP from brewers waste rather than de novo production from petroleum products. Individuals, identified as key workers in Iraq\u0092s BW programme, continued as members of the staff of Al-Hakam. In the years after 1991, Iraq attempted to obtain dual-purpose equipment including industrial-scale fermentors from within the country and abroad., 112737=63. In contravention of the requirements of resolution 687 (1991), Iraq did not declare its efforts to produce guidance and control (G&C) instruments for its Al Hussein class missiles. After the Commission discovered, in August 1991, a facility for the development and production of such components, Iraq declared reverse-engineering efforts in this area., 173964=107. In January 1996, a Commission inspection team discovered, during an on-site inspection of a missile facility, computer files with a missile simulation programme. They contained evidence that in July 1992, a flight simulation of a 3-stage missile had been executed. The simulated missile was based on proscribed SCUD-B missiles. Iraq described the product of the simulation as a \"Space Launch Vehicle\" that was an effort of an unidentified engineer working on his own. The inspection team later determined that the input/output data, as well as the simulation programme itself, had been copied to floppy diskettes in September 1992. Forensic examination also revealed that the diskettes obtained by the team were part of a larger collection of computer disks that were not found by the team nor provided by Iraq. Due to the manner in which Iraq interfered with the team\u0092s analysis of the acquired diskettes, a proper chain of evidence was not maintained, resulting in additional questions related to the nature and implications of the proscribed activities discovered., 170537=102. Until late 1995, Iraq retained a number of original gyroscope instruments for proscribed SCUD-B/Al Hussein missiles. In October 1995, Iraq turned over to the Commission more than a dozen proscribed gyroscopes and related technical drawings. Iraq explained that, following Lt. General Hussein Kamil's defection, an \"amnesty\" order was issued by the Government. By this order, retained proscribed components could be turned over \"anonymously\" at various collection points. The gyroscopes appeared as a result of this campaign. The Commission asked for specific explanations regarding the reasons for retention of proscribed items, the \"collection\" sites, dates of collection of items etc. Iraq has not provided complete clarifications of these events., 468196=Iraq would have developed a requirement for a militarily significant arsenal of biological weapons in 1987/88, or possibly earlier, based on strategic planning. This in turn would define the technical scope of the programme and the appropriate funding to ensure the eventual success of the programme., 372041=1848 kg, 212775=19. Iraq\u0092s declarations on its total holdings of key precursors over the period of 8 years could not be fully verified due to the absence of sufficient evidence provided by Iraq and its foreign suppliers for Iraq\u0092s procurement and the consumption of key precursors in the production of CW agents prior to 1988, as declared by Iraq., 166678=99. In November 1993, \"working groups\" were established in Iraq tasked to work on gyroscope instruments of the proscribed missile. Iraq declared that the order to begin this effort was issued by Lt. General Hussein Kamil. To accomplish the task, samples of original SCUD-B gyroscopes were required. As Iraq\u0092s officials told the Commission, one engineer, of his own accord, had kept one set of three such gyroscopic instruments in his home as a \"souvenir\". The engineer then decided to turn these instruments over to the new working groups. In addition, a technician is said to have turned in microfilmed drawings of proscribed gyroscopic instruments done by a foreign supplier prior to the Gulf War. Iraq declared that the gyroscope project had been stopped after only two weeks of work. Drawings produced by the working groups, along with the gyroscopes themselves, were claimed to have been confiscated by Iraqi authorities in 1993, but it was decided not to hand them over to the Commission at that time. The microfilm with drawings was said to have been destroyed. Due to the lack of supporting documentation, the Commission is not able to verify Iraq's declarations on the nature and duration of these proscribed activities nor on disposal of all proscribed items and drawings involved., 161570=in spite of the decision to unilaterally destroy all remaining prohibited items in July 1991, secret efforts were made to preserve essential capabilities for resumption of proscribed activities in the future;, 315987=The concept was to produce a MIG-21 aircraft that could take off and fly on a preset flight path without a pilot on board. The plane would carry a drop-tank containing BW agent. After a preset time the valves on the tank would open and disseminate the agent. The aircraft would continue to fly until it ran out of fuel. One experiment was undertaken on 10 January 1991 at the Iraqi Air Force Al-Rasheed Airbase. The reason given for dropping the project was the intervention of the 1991 war, expressed as \"the situation at that time\"., 581246=4. Iraq initially refused to accept its obligations under resolution 715 (1991) and the Plan for OMV approved by the resolution. Through early and mid-1993, the Commission undertook an effort in the missile area called \"interim monitoring\". It was designed to gain a better understanding of the requirements and resources that would be necessary to conduct future full-scale monitoring activities in the missile area once Iraq accepted the Plan for OMV. In May 1993, the Commission began the provisional installation of cameras to observe Iraq\u0092s main static test stand for missile engines., 565620=28. Iraq states it ended its illegal concealment activities in 1995, but has never provided any evidence, such as documentation, to support this claim. In light of uncertainties concerning remaining disarmament issues, and less than full cooperation by Iraq, monitoring will have to take into account evasion techniques. If ongoing concealment were to be uncovered, this would be a matter of grave concern both intrinsically and in terms of the credibility of the OMV system., 343930=Other agents produced: It is not possible to determine if bacterial or toxin agents other than those stated in the 1997 FFCD were produced. Seed stocks of other agents were actively sought for and obtained by Iraq\u0092s BW programme., 540585=18. The logistics of the movement of proscribed materials required communications and transportation support of a highly reliable and sensitive nature. In examining imagery from 1991, it was found that Special Republican Guard vehicles had been used to move equipment involved in planned nuclear weapons production when it was being hidden from the IAEA. In addition, the personnel involved had Special Republican Guard affiliations - like Major Izzadine mentioned earlier. Also, imagery taken during inspections in 1996 and 1997 showed significant vehicle movement at Special Republican Guard sites in reaction to ongoing inspection activities., 373430=1768 kg, 176352=110. Available evidence shows that around August 1991, Iraq started a secret project to construct a surface-to-surface missile called \"J-1\" without notifying the Commission as required by the Security Council resolutions. No aspect of the J-1 programme \u0096 from design, to parts manufactured, to flight-testing \u0096 was declared to the Commission until late 1995 i.e. some two years after it was allegedly aborted. Iraq states that Lt. General Hussein Kamil issued the orders both for the project itself and for the requirement to keep it a secret from the Commission., 231711=28. In addition in 1997, 197 pieces of glass production equipment were admitted by Iraq and destroyed under UNSCOM supervision., 33694=6. Through its verification process, the Commission has been accumulating evidence that Iraq\u0092s initial and subsequent disclosures of proscribed weapons holdings and missile capabilities were inadequate. This required additional actions by the Commission to dispose of proscribed items, identified through the verification process, as well as new declarations to be presented by Iraq. In August 1995, Iraq admitted that important information on its proscribed programmes had been hidden from the Commission including a considerable amount of documentation. As a consequence, Iraq agreed to prepare a new Full, Final and Complete Disclosure (FFCD) in the missile area. Such an official declaration was provided by Iraq in November 1995. The Commission did not accept this declaration as either a full or complete disclosure. Iraq submitted another FFCD in June 1996. The latter document, supplemented subsequently by numerous Iraqi explanations and clarifications, has been the basis for the Commission\u0092s verification activities., 281297=In April 1998, the Commission\u0092s report to the Security Council (S/1998/332) listed the priority issues identified by the TEM. These included: history of the BW programme, organizations involved, acquisitions, research and development, production, weaponization and materials balance. In May 1998, Iraq provided clarifications of some issues arising from the TEM but has failed to resolve any of the key issues outstanding. Subsequently on 3 and 4 June 1998, the Commission provided a technical briefing to the Security Council. This gave an outline of the material balance and the main outstanding disarmament issues in each weapons area. In biology, this briefing highlighted the lack of verifiable details on virtually the entirety of the programme., 64655=30. Iraq\u0092s declarations and supporting documents include a specific distribution, by their type and warfare agent filling, of the 45 special warheads unilaterally destroyed in July 1991. According to Iraq\u0092s declarations, 20 of them were chemical weapons and contained only the alcohol component of the CW binary system. Analysis at the laboratories designated by the Commission has detected the presence of degradation products of nerve agents, in particular VX, on a number of warhead remnants which were excavated. A meeting of international experts, including representatives of the three laboratories, which was held on 22-23 October 1998 concluded that \"the existence of VX degradation products conflicts with Iraq\u0092s declarations that the unilaterally destroyed special warheads had never been filled with any chemical warfare agents. The findings by all three laboratories of chemicals known to be degradation products of decontamination compounds also do not support Iraq\u0092s declarations that those warhead containers had only been in contact with alcohols.\" Clarification by Iraq of these issues as recommended by the meeting would allow the Commission to make a determination whether or not the current assessment of the quantity of special warheads identified amongst the remnants excavated, accounts for all special warheads declared to have been produced by Iraq and provides for the verification of their unilateral destruction., 181035=117. Iraq had a project, prior to the Gulf War, to construct a dedicated facility to indigenously produce proscribed missile propellants for Al Hussein missiles (for details, see Section 2, above). The project continued after the adoption of resolution 687 (1991) in April 1991. After the Commission presented its evidence of such activities to Iraq, Iraq admitted in 1996 that such a project had existed and its construction had continued after April 1991. Iraq explained that the completion of the construction of the project\u0092s buildings had been accomplished as a part of the \"reconstruction campaign\" and the project had not been fully implemented due to technical difficulties in the procurement of some equipment. No supporting documentation has been provided by Iraq to support its declarations., 492532=Although Iraq acknowledged its offensive BW programme in 1995, it has yet to make a full disclosure. One of the most obvious omissions is information concerning the termination of its offensive BW programme. The evidence collected by the Commission and the absence of information from Iraq, raises serious doubts about Iraq\u0092s assertion that the BW programme was truly obliterated in 1991., 44341=16. As a result of the emergency session of the Special Commission on 21 November 1997, the members of the Commission stated that they were \"satisfied that 817 of the 819 proscribed missiles imported by Iraq have been effectively accounted for\"., 187616=October 1997) that Iraq\u0092s declarations on its total acquisition and expenditure of CW munitions during the period 1982-1988 could not be verified fully due to the absence of sufficient evidence of: the procurement, indigenous production, the filling with CW agents and the consumption of special munitions prior to 1988, as declared by Iraq., 283904=Iraq has recently pressed for the experts to make a \"quality assessment,\" as to whether any biological weapons or agent remain in Iraq. This was emphatically stressed by Iraq during a meeting between him and the Commission\u0092s Chief Inspector in July 1998. Given the present information disclosed by Iraq, such an assessment could not be made., 293271=The account of Iraq\u0092s Al-Hussein BW warheads has changed frequently over the past few years. In July 1998, even in the space of a few weeks, Iraq made \u0091suggestions\u0092 changing the numbers of warheads filled with particular BW agents and their deployment and destruction. The physical evidence from the destruction area and the analyses of the remnants contradicts the account contained in the FFCD. Thus the FFCD account is inaccurate and is not validated., 11899=17. In response to the Commission's requests for relevant documents, Iraq has repeatedly claimed that they no longer exist or cannot be located, a claim which often has been shown to be false, either because inspection activities have in fact located precisely such documents or because Iraq has reversed its stated position and then produced relevant documents. The Commission briefed the Council on its assessment of the existence and importance of documents in June 1998. The Commission has assessed that the documents provided in August 1995 were only selected categories of documents were provided and that other categories were retained by Iraq. It remains the Commission\u0092s strong view that, under the present circumstances, relevant documentation exists in Iraq and that provision of such documentation is the best hope for revealing the full picture, as required by the relevant resolutions., 288989=In August 1995 Iraq declared that it had filled 25 Al-Hussein missile warheads with BW agents. This figure is not supported by conclusive evidence. In its FFCD Iraq has declared that five warheads were filled with Bacillus anthracis spores, 16 with botulinum toxin and four with aflatoxin. Ten warheads containing botulinum toxin were deployed to an abandoned railway tunnel at Al-Mansuriyah. The remainder was stored on the banks of the Tigris canal. No credible evidence has been presented to support this account of BW agent filling and subsequent weapon deployment., 169103=101. In August 1994, two major missile facilities in Iraq signed new contracts with the same middleman whom they had been warned not to deal with. According to Iraq, the director of one of them included in his order a \"secret list\" detailing a wide variety of production and other technologies including missile gyroscope instruments that the middleman was to deliver. The \"secret list\" from this contract was worth several million dollars. After several months, the middleman obtained from a foreign supplier a cache of gyroscopes and accelerometers for long range missiles proscribed under resolution 687 (1991). The middleman managed to ship some of these proscribed items to Iraq in July 1995. A shipment of additional gyroscopes under the contract was intercepted in Jordan in November 1995. Iraq initially denied that it had been involved in this acquisition of proscribed items. When it admitted its involvement in December 1995, it stated that the middleman mistakenly purchased gyroscopes which Iraq had never ordered. The Government of Iraq declared that it had formally investigated this case. Documents related to the middleman\u0092s activities were provided to the Commission. The Commission has conducted an extensive investigation into this case. The investigations confirmed that Iraq\u0092s authorities and missile facilities had been involved in the acquisition of proscribed components., 158964=87. In November 1993, Iraq informed the Security Council that the Government of Iraq had decided to accept the obligations set forth in resolution 715 (1991) and to comply with the provisions of the plans for ongoing monitoring and verification contained therein., 240409=3) Several tens of pieces of equipment are buried under the debris of production buildings destroyed during the 1991 Gulf war., 79817=48. In late 1995, Iraq provided to the Commission, an inventory of proscribed missiles that it destroyed unilaterally. In addition to imported missiles that it destroyed, the inventory contained a reference to seven indigenously produced missiles. Iraq explained that these were missiles or missile engines that had been given to the Army\u0092s Surface-to-Surface Missile Forces as \"training\" missiles. No documentation has been provided to confirm that these particular missiles were for training purposes. Although Iraq declared that these seven indigenous missiles were destroyed together with 85 imported combat missiles, remnants of the indigenous missiles or their engines, which could prove their unilateral destruction, have not been recovered by the Commission at the declared destruction sites., 4597=4. From the inception of the relevant work, in 1991, Iraq's compliance has been limited. Iraq acknowledges that, in that year, it decided to limit its disclosures for the purpose of retaining substantial prohibited weapons and capabilities., 325134=122mm Rocket Warheads: The majority of the declared BW field trials carried out by Iraq involved the testing of 122mm rocket warheads. This part of the programme proceeded in an ordered and logical fashion, commencing with static tests of single warheads and culminating with salvoes of rockets charged with BW agent or simulant. There are documents, video tapes and interview information detailing this work. The Iraqi reports on these trials submitted to MIC, point out the success of the system and recommend adoption of this weapon for the delivery of Agents A, B, C and D. Despite the progress made over a period of years, the development of 122mm warheads was said to have been abandoned by August 1990. The 122mm warhead was considered unsuitable by Iraq \"for the impending conflict\". The full scope of this work, the rationale for the use of these weapons and the seemingly abrupt end of the project have never been satisfactorily explained., 31618=3. With Iraq\u0092s full cooperation and its commitment to the implementation of its obligations under the Security Council resolutions, these tasks in the missile area could have been accomplished in a relatively short period of time. Instead Iraq has chosen a course of withholding its proscribed missile capabilities and obstruction of the Commission\u0092s work. Examples of this policy were Iraq\u0092s decision, immediately after the adoption of resolution 687 (1991) in April 1991, to retain two-thirds of its operational force of proscribed missiles and the concealment of its capabilities to indigenously manufacture proscribed missiles with liquid propellant engines., 255820=In September 1997, Iraq submitted its third \"final\" FFCD since the July 1995 disclosures. This FFCD contained essentially no new significant information from the previous one that the Commission had rejected as incomplete. A panel of international experts reviewed it in September 1997 and considered it as deficient in all areas. Iraq however argued that it had not been given an adequate opportunity to present its case to the UNSCOM assembled experts and at Iraq\u0092s request, a Technical Evaluation Meeting (TEM) between Iraq and a Commission assembled panel of international experts convened in Vienna in March 1998. Iraq did not present any new information at that meeting and the experts therefore reviewed the same material for a third time., 399630=There is inadequate or in some cases no supportive evidence for munitions acquisition, both for weaponization and for field trials. Although the account of the acquisition of materials for the aerosol generator (Zubaidy device) was incomplete in the 1996 FFCD, much of the information presented in that version has been intentionally omitted in the 1997 FFCD., 533025=9. Other elements of the unilateral destruction presentation by Iraq were also proved to be false. The precise locations of warhead destruction and the fill of warheads have been revised several times by Iraq. The movements of concealed warheads prior to unilateral destruction, claimed by Iraq, have been proven to be false. The explanations provided on concealment and movement of retained chemical weapons production equipment was likewise shown to be false. Iraq's admissions have only been made during 1997-1998. The Commission still does not know the precise meaning or significance of Iraq's failure to provide accurate data about proscribed weapons activities and it's provision of false information., 30070=1. In its resolution 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991, the Security Council required Iraq to unconditionally accept the destruction, removal or rendering harmless, under international supervision, of all ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometres and related major parts, and repair and production facilities. To that end, Iraq was specifically required:, 122018=75. In response to resolution 687 (1991), Iraq declared three facilities which had been under construction in Iraq as part of the BADR 2000 infrastructure as well as some of the equipment and materials procured for the programme. The Commission supervised the destruction of all declared items. In February 1992, the Commission also identified, for destruction in accordance with resolution 687 (1991), additional critical equipment and buildings at these facilities. Initially, Iraq refused to comply with this decision. Following Iraq\u0092s disclosure of the unilateral destruction in March 1992, Iraq relented and the equipment and buildings at the BADR 2000 facilities were destroyed under the Commission\u0092s supervision. In 1996, Iraq declared that it had diverted critical tools and materials from the BADR 200 programme and buried them in a hide site. These items had been declared unilaterally destroyed and were shown to the Commission in May 1992. Table 11 summarizes the destruction completed at all three BADR 2000 facilities:, 61957=28. As a result of the Technical Evaluation Meeting on the proscribed missile warheads held in February 1998 in Baghdad, the Commission\u0092s team of international experts determined that Iraq\u0092s warhead production and acquisition records were the best way to obtain the full picture of Iraq\u0092s warhead production. No documents have been provided by Iraq in response to this request. According to the team, issues related to the warhead material balance and accounting such as duplicate counting, warhead destruction activities and warhead markings, need to be fully resolved to enable the establishment of a solid and verifiable material balance in the warhead area. In July and November 1998, the Commission again asked Iraq for clarifications to be provided to facilitate the completion of the verification. The Commission has not received answers from Iraq that would allow to achieve this goal., 34739=7. In June 1996, Iraq and the Commission established a Joint Programme of Action and agreed to concentrate work on certain fundamental areas. The first priority among them was the material balance of proscribed weapons and their major components. The other established priorities were: the unilateral destruction of proscribed items; further provision of documentation, when available, related to proscribed weapons programmes; and the identification of measures taken in 1991 and the measures used by certain individuals to retain some proscribed items until August 1995. Subsequently, the June 1996 Joint Programme of Work was elaborated through discussions between the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq and the Executive Chairman., 616449=67. The Commission believes that the deployment in Iraq of its own system to track in-flight tests of missiles would considerably improve monitoring in the missile area. The Commission carried out a survey mission in December 1998 in preparation for the future use of the tracking system., 187533=9. The Special Commission reported to the Security Council (S/1997/774 of 6, 517428=From November 1990 until the cease-fire in 1991 Iraq worked to produce a system able to deliver large volumes of BW agent aerosol from high-performance aircraft. It is stated that four such drop-tank weapons were produced. The remains of three have been accounted for. There is no evidence to establish whether only four were produced nor have other details of this aspect been addressed by Iraq. In tandem with this work, Iraq attempted to develop, apparently unsuccessfully, a pilotless aircraft to carry the drop-tank weapon. Very little information exists on this latter project, and it is possible that it was intended for CW use or both BW and CW., 252658=52. The Commission identified these issues as priorities on two grounds. Firstly, the resolution of these particular issues would allow the Commission to verify the disposition of Iraq's most advanced proscribed weapons and capabilities and secondly, their resolution would increase considerably the degree of confidence in the accounting for other areas where gaps and inconsistencies still remain. Firstly, the majority of these issues were identified as priorities by the Emergency Session of the Special Commission and endorsed by the Security Council in November 1997. In June 1998, they were included in the \"Road map\" of disarmament issues provided by the Commission to the Security Council. Finally, the chemical issues of the \"Road map\" were accepted by Iraq within the scope of the Schedule for work., 228257=1 - Quantities of key precursors declared by Iraq in 1995 as having been destroyed unilaterally in 1991., 524914=Throughout the investigation of the programme there has been a systematic and comprehensive attempt by Iraq to conceal the programme and deceive the Commission. Until 1995 all aspects of the offensive BW programme were concealed and active measures taken to deceive the Commission. Since August 1995, Iraq has submitted a number of FFCDs of its declared BW programme. These declarations have been assessed by the Commission and by international experts as incomplete, inadequate and containing substantial deficiencies. They were not accepted as a full account of the scale and the scope of Iraq\u0092s BW programme. This refers in particular to weaponization of produced BW agents, bulk BW agent produced and acquisitions for the BW programme. Consistently Iraq has tried to understate the scale and importance of the BW programme as a whole, and the success of individual components., 276862=Since July 1995, the Commission has conducted 35 biological inspections directly or indirectly related to investigations of Iraq\u0092s proscribed BW programme. In addition, two inspections devoted to the destruction of sites, known to be integral components of the programme, have been undertaken. The past programme investigations have concentrated on issues that are directly related to disarmament and have attempted to validate these aspects of Iraq\u0092s Full Final and Complete Disclosure (FFCD), generally without success. This considerable effort has been negated by Iraq\u0092s intransigence and failure to provide cooperation concerning its biological weapons since January 1996., 472474=Over the past eight years the Commission has conducted some 70 inspections directly concerned with biological warfare activities undertaken by Iraq. In addition, six joint chemical and biological inspections have been undertaken, including one that included missile experts. Sixteen monitoring teams have followed biological activities in Iraq\u0092s industrial, agricultural, medical and academic facilities. More than twenty of these inspections were direct investigations of Iraq\u0092s proscribed BW programme and two were involved with destruction of facilities involved in the programme. The remainder included establishing protocols and procedures for monitoring, detailed audits of key facilities, determination of indigenous capability, and searches for documents. In addition two major meetings were held to exchange information, during August 1993, in New York, and March 1998, at the TEM in Vienna. On both occasions, Iraq produced no additional information to enable a true appreciation of its entire BW programme., 582565=7. At the time of the adoption of the Plan for OMV in 1991 and the subsequent establishment of the Commission\u0092s monitoring system in 1994, there was no established precedent for an international inspection and monitoring regime to verify missile related activities similar to the requirements established by the Security Council. No proven or tested procedures existed that could have served as a model for the construction of a regime for verification of Iraq\u0092s compliance with the prohibitions on proscribed missiles imposed by the Council, while allowing Iraq to conduct a full scope of activities with missiles of a shorter range., 389211=In July 1998 international biological experts reviewed with Iraq, at the request of ist Deputy Prime Minister, its biological FFCD, specifically addressing material balance as outlined above. On the material balances for weapons, agents and media the team came to the following conclusions:, 471532=Other issues include the technological coherence of the programme. The less coherent the programme appears to be the greater the dependency for verification on documentation and physical evidence. Iraq tries to portray its BW programme as an inept programme without guidance or direction. The Commission\u0092s assessment of Iraq\u0092s level of technology does not support this contention. Iraq asserts that its BW programme was obliterated in 1991. There is little confidence that its programme has been ended. Throughout all of the issues in all three parts of this report is the pattern of concealment and deception employed by Iraq to prevent a true picture of its BW programme from emerging. These issues are addressed below., 133201=78. In response to resolution 687 (1991), Iraq declared components that it had acquired for both the 350mm and 1000mm guns. The Commission supervised the destruction of the declared components in 1991. An accounting of the components is provided in Table 12., 249242=45. The Commission found two examples of such manuals related to the production of precursors in the files from the Haider farm. The Commission also found references to manuals on the production of different types of chemical warfare agents, including VX. According to Iraq, the major part of CW related technological documentation was destroyed unilaterally in 1991., 468667=According to Iraq's account, the involvement of MOD in the BW programme ceased with the transfer of the biology group from Al-Muthanna to TRC that was under the control of MIC. Iraq asserts this MOD link was only re-established specifically for the deployment of weapons in January 1991. The explanation given is that MIC had a higher status than the MOD and was a self-contained entity that could progress from initiation to deployment of weapons without external input. This has not been substantiated., 579673=1. The Commission\u0092s Plan for the ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq\u0092s compliance (the Plan for OMV) was approved by the Security Council in its resolution 715 (1991) of 11 October 1991. The Plan for OMV established specific obligations for Iraq. The Plan also laid out a set of comprehensive rights for the Commission under which it could develop and operate a monitoring system in Iraq in order to fulfil its mandate., 334648=Clostridium botulinum toxin, Agent A: It is not possible to verify the amount of Agent A produced, placed into munitions or otherwise consumed as presented in the 1997 FFCD. Various accounts of the destruction of bulk Agent A were made in both the FFCD and by independent Iraqi testimony. There is insufficient documentation to verify either the quantity of Agent A destroyed or whether remaining bulk agent in summer 1991was destroyed. Methodology employed in destruction and location of destruction, similarly, can not be determined., 544282=24. In early 1997, the Commission again undertook an inspection of sites related to organizations identified with concealment actions. During these inspections, sites related to the hiding of proscribed material, transportation, and the organization of movements were inspected. In addition, sites were selected which were related to the procurement of material thought to be proscribed., 527066=2. Immediately following the Gulf war, the Iraqi Presidency collected reports on weapons remaining with Iraq's Armed Forces after the war, including its weapons prohibited by recently adopted resolution 687(1991). Such documents were provided to the Presidency in the spring of 1991. A decision was taken by a high-level committee (one of whose members was Deputy Prime Minister Mr. Tariq Aziz) to provide to the Commission only a portion of its proscribed weapons, their components and production capabilities and stocks. The policy, as deduced from a range of evidence available to the Commission including the initial false Iraq\u0092s declarations, was based on the following Iraqi actions:, 529271=4. Iraq did not admit to its illegal unilateral destruction until March 1992, approximately nine months after the destruction activities, and even then only after the Commission indicated it had evidence that Iraq retained weapons after its supervised destruction. Iraq states that \"The unilateral destruction was carried out entirely unrecorded. No written and no visual records were kept, as it was not foreseen that Iraq needed to prove the destruction to anybody.\" Such an approach also indicates that Iraq intended to pursue a policy of concealment in its relations with the Commission and the IAEA., 364376=The FFCD identifies two losses of media prior to the first UNSCOM BW inspection. The first was said to have occurred during the evacuation of Al-Hakam and the relocation of its headquarters to Al-Asma\u0092a school about 30 km away. It is stated that equipment important to the functioning of departments was relocated to the school on 22-23 January 1991. Included was an unknown quantity of media of various, but unidentified, types. At some time before the return to Al-Hakam in May 1991, Iraq claims the school was broken into and some items stolen and damaged including some of the media., 495803=A serious concern remaining is that the unilateral destruction of documents, agents and weapons in 1991 was linked to the concealment issue rather than the issue of obliteration of its programme. The difference being, that in the first case, only part of all assets may have been destroyed, purely to deceive the Commission and feign liquidation of the programme. Indeed, the Commission is aware that Iraq at least retained suitable growth media, capable facilities, production equipment, teams of expert personnel, and the essential technical know-how. Until today, no credible declaration has been presented by Iraq as to if and when it obliterated its BW programme., 582062=6. The Commission then began implementation of the monitoring system in the missile area. It conducted a number of baseline inspections of missile facilities and facilities with dual-use capabilities declared by Iraq. Declared operational missiles subject to monitoring were inspected and tagged. In August 1994, a resident missile monitoring team was established, for the first time, at the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Centre (BMVC)., 546731=29. The Commission continued to press Iraq to provide full and verifiable explanations of its concealment activities. Iraq insisted that it was not concealing any proscribed weapons. The Commission found: significant gaps in every weapons area; and, that Iraq\u0092s active measures to deceive the Commission were responsible for its inability to verify the disposition of prohibited weapons. Reports that prohibited material still existed in Iraq continued to be received by the Commission. The Commission, following its presentation to the Council, established its list of priority disarmament issues and discussed these with Iraq during the Summer of 1998. The concealment issue was included in that list. Iraq declined to discuss the issue at that time., 27273=37. Since the adoption of Security Council resolution 687 (1991) in April 1991 and until July 1995, Iraq denied that it had had any proscribed biological warfare (BW) activities. Based on the results of its inspection and verification activities, the Commission assessed and reported to the Council in its report of April 1995, that Iraq had not provided an account of its proscribed biological programme nor accounted for materials and items that may have been used or acquired for such a programme. The Commission stated that with Iraq\u0092s failure to account for the use of these items and materials for legitimate purposes, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that there is a high risk that they had been purchased and used for a proscribed purpose - acquisition of biological warfare agent. Iraq was provided with evidence collected by the Commission. On 1 July 1995, Iraq, for the first time, acknowledged that it had had an offensive BW programme but still denied any weaponization. Subsequently, in August 1995, after the departure form Iraq of Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Hassan, Iraq admitted that it had weaponized BW agents and deployed biological weapons for combat use., 697126=18. Since the inception of aerial inspection missions in 1992, modalities governing the operation of the Commission\u0092s helicopters require the Commission to provide Iraq with a geographically defined \"box\" within which aerial activity will take place. This box is provided to the National Monitoring Directorate some 12 hours before the helicopter mission. The use of the boxes where sites are isolated, or some distance from Baghdad, degrades the element of surprise (and thus credibility) achieved during aerial inspections. Iraq claims that it requires the boxes in order to warn the air defence of the operating area of the Commission\u0092s aircraft. Under current modalities, the Commission is unable to fly unrestricted aerial missions over Baghdad., 259174=At Iraq\u0092s request another review of the FFCD by a team of international experts was conducted in Baghdad in July 1998. By agreement with Iraq and the Special Commission this team focused on those elements directly related to the material balance: weapons, bulk agents and materials such as bacterial growth media. This team concluded:, 592114=25. It should be noted that after the adoption of resolutions 687 and 715 (1991), Iraq undertook a number of missile activities that are covered by the Plan for OMV. These were not declared by Iraq in accordance with the Plan. The most significant of these covert programmes was a project called J-1 to acquire surface-to-surface liquid propellant missiles through the modification of surface-to-air missiles already available to Iraq. This project was not declared to the Commission until 1995, that is, more than two years after it had been allegedly aborted., 199709=2) In 1996, documentary evidence was found by UNSCOM that DB-2 bombs had also been filled with mustard (which was not declared). In 1997, Iraq stated that only a few bombs were filled with mustard for trials., 512035=Chicken Farm\" documents. Despite Iraq\u0092s claims, they are judged to be of low significance. The more significant documents, Iraq states to have collected in November 1991, have not been provided to the Commission, yet., 37081=11. Beyond the material balances related to proscribed missiles and the status of relevant facilities, the paper does not address other issues that were investigated by the Commission and which may or may not have reached a satisfactory resolution. This includes Iraq\u0092s efforts related to the development of missiles or their sub-systems which have been assessed by the Commission as not having achieved operational status or which would not contribute substantially to proscribed operational capabilities already available to Iraq. Examples of such issues are missile delivery means for nuclear weapons, parachute retarded missile warheads \"Meteo 1\", separating missile warheads, undisclosed warhead designs, Iraq\u0092s efforts to develop missiles with ranges from 1000 to 3000 kilometers and Iraq\u0092s space launch vehicle, Al-Abid. Issues related to retention by Iraq of expertise in the proscribed missile area, and design/production/assembly documentation as well as military infrastructure of the proscribed missile operational force have not been addressed in this paper. The paper does not describe the Commission\u0092s investigations of Iraq\u0092s foreign procurement in support of its proscribed missile activities., 162711=92. After the adoption of resolution 687 (1991), Iraq attempted to retain all available production equipment from its factories to manufacture liquid propellant engines for proscribed Al Hussein class missiles. As reported above, this equipment was destroyed or rendered harmless by the Commission only in July 1995. Up to November 1995, Iraq had been misleading the Commission as to the nature and capabilities of the equipment retained., 623925=82. Initially, in 1994, the Commission decided not to tag SA2/Volga surface-to-air missiles in Iraq. Although such missiles fall under definitions contained in the Plan for OMV and Iraq attempted, prior to the adoption of resolution 687 (1991), to modify such missiles for a surface-to-surface role, the Commission decided again to resort to less intrusive monitoring procedures for such missiles in order to accommodate, to the maximum, Iraq\u0092s stated security concerns. After August 1995, Iraq declared that, after the adoption of resolution 687 (1991), it had secretly conducted modifications of SA2/Volga missiles for a surface-to-surface role without declaring such activities to the Commission. In response, the Commission changed its earlier decision not to tag these missiles. During 1996, these missiles were tagged and added to the list of missiles for annual inspections., 608372=53. While missile resident teams have the responsibility to inspect sites on a daily basis, the Commission also sends non-resident teams to Iraq to conduct special monitoring inspections. Such inspections require specialised expertise, training, operational planning and support. Examples of such inspection missions are: missile tagging and tag checks; missile test activity observation; missile technology updates; baseline inspections; and, compliance inspections. Several missions went to Iraq to conduct discussions of monitoring activities with the Iraqi counterparts. Over 40 non-resident teams have been to Iraq on monitoring inspections and missions since 1994., 164964=96. Iraq retained, until late 1995, a parachute device for retarding Al Hussein warheads despite repeated questions posed by the Commission concerning such a proscribed device. Iraq has not provided technically consistent explanations for the procurement of such systems prior to adoption of resolution 687 (1991) nor for the retention of the set until 1995., 533919=11. The Commission focussed a dedicated effort into investigating Iraq's concealment policy and actions following the events of August 1995, when Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamal left Iraq. This investigation proceeded through various stages and developed progressively more information on not only what had been hidden up until 1995, but what still remained concealed. One piece of this investigation involved a Major in the Special Republican Guard, Izzadine al-Majid. He was tasked by higher authorities in July 1991 to receive a shipment of production equipment and critical components related to Iraq's indigenous proscribed missile programmes which had been diverted from secret unilateral destruction. He was ordered to hide these materials on the premises of a private villa in the west Baghdad suburb of Abu Ghraib. The materials remained hidden at that location until March 1992 when the Special Republican Guard retrieved them to move them to another location. Iraq did not declare any of this information, the Commission learned it from Major Izzadine al-Majid and other participants in the operation., 420134=The period of 1979 to 1984 remains a void in the Commission's understanding although there is considerable evidence of biological activities during that period - continuation of a building programme originally for the Al-Hazen Institute, retention of Al-Hazen staff at Al-Salman, Prof. Nasser Hindawi's submission for a research programme, acquisition of dual capable equipment, and placement of staff abroad for training. In other words the programme seems to have continued albeit with different objectives, emphasis, management, and resources., 175766=109. In late 1993, a large shipment of ammonium perchlorate, a key ingredient of missile solid propellant, was intercepted in one of the regional sea ports outside Iraq. The shipment was intended for Iraq\u0092s missile programmes. This attempt to import missile-related materials, explicitly covered under the Monitoring plan, was not voluntarily declared by Iraq until the Commission\u0092s knowledge of this attempt was revealed to Iraq by the Commission., 214508=22. The material balance of 3,915 tonnes of key precursors declared by Iraq remaining as of January 1991 is provided in table 3., 476103=Iraq has claimed that all documents concerned with its biological weapons programmes were destroyed in 1991. Lacking documents, other approaches have been adopted to investigate and verify Iraq\u0092s account of its programme. Interviewing personnel associated with the programme has been the main approach. Iraq has been reluctant to provide personnel to substantiate the details of its programme. Generally, only individuals identified from Haidar Farm documents and documents, otherwise recovered, have been presented. Technical assessments of the facilities and equipment acknowledged to be a part of the programme, sampling, and exploitation of recovered weapons and fragments have also contributed to the inspection process., 304747=The account of Iraq\u0092s R-400 aerial bombs has been changed several times since 1991. Even in July 1998 Iraq has made \u0091suggestions\u0092 changing the numbers of bombs filled with particular BW agents. The inconsistency between the FFCD account and the physical evidence means that the Iraqi account cannot be confirmed. Thus, the FFCD account is not verified., 97336=57. In November 1995, Iraq declared that it had indigenously produced some 80 combustion chamber and nozzle (CC/N) assemblies for proscribed missile engines. Table 8 provides a summary of the material balance of the declared quantity of CC/N assemblies., 515335=Iraq has released information over the years very selectively. When Iraq is aware that the Commission has details of a particular event or circumstance, then a document will be released. Very little new information has been disclosed since 1995. There are many inconsistencies and contradictions in documents, personal testimony and physical evidence. However, the accumulation of inconsistencies creates patterns, which show that the FFCD is incorrect., 516739=The FFCD states that 200 R-400 aerial bombs were manufactured for the BW programme, and that 157 of these were filled with BW agents, deployed and unilaterally destroyed. The evidence available indicates that more than 200 were available for the BW programme. Iraq admits that the numbers filled with particular agents are guesses. Statements in 1998 by Iraq have further confused this matter. The physical evidence from the remnants, accounts for less than one third of those said to have been unilaterally destroyed., 564602=26. The extent of Iraq\u0092s cooperation is the key determinant for the level of OMV procedures employed, and the resulting confidence in the system. Iraq has provided varying degrees of cooperation since 1991. Where cooperation has been good, monitoring has been good. The better the information and access provided by Iraq, the less intrusive the OMV procedures and the higher the confidence in the resulting assessments of Iraq\u0092s compliance., 28466=38. Since August 1995, Iraq has submitted a number of \"Full, Final and Complete Disclosures\" (FFCD) of its declared BW programme. These declarations have been assessed by the Commission and by international experts as incomplete, inadequate and containing substantial deficiencies. They were not accepted as a full account of the scale and the scope of Iraq\u0092s BW programme. This refers in particular to weaponization of produced BW agents, bulk BW agent production and acquisitions for the BW programme., 228369=2 - Only key precursors that Iraq declared as remaining as of January 1991 are included in the column. The following key precursors, according to Iraq, were fully consumed prior to 1991: DMMP, MPC, TMP, MPS, and they are not included in the table., 636350=2. The General objectives for monitoring in the chemical area is to monitor and to verify that activities, sites, facilities, materials and other items, both military and civilian, are not used by Iraq in contravention of its obligations. The system of chemical monitoring was established in Iraq in October 1994., 196925=2) In 1998, Iraq presented documents on the conversion of 15,616 shells to conventional munitions. Of these, 1,779 converted shells were accounted for by UNSCOM., 641673=10. Iraq\u0092s declarations required under the Plan for OMV have been significantly improved over the period of the last four years. However, they are still not accurate and complete. For example, the Commission has repeatedly found declarable items of equipment and chemicals not included in Iraq\u0092s declarations. Each such case is subject to investigation. Under the Plan, the Commission has the right to destroy undeclared items of dual-use equipment and materials. In September 1997, 197 pieces of glass chemical production equipment, originating from the former CW production facility, were destroyed as determined by the Commission., 229400=23. CW production and support facilities were constructed in Iraq from 1983 to 1990. According to Iraq, all CW agent production plants were located at the Muthanna State Establishment (MSE). Iraq declared that all CW agents were produced only at MSE., 384273=1100, 690742=2. The Export/Import monitoring mechanism, which was approved by Security Council resolution 1051 (1996), was designed to provide for timely information about any sale or supply to Iraq by other States of items listed in the Commission\u0092s and the IAEA\u0092s Annexes to the Plans for OMV., 241325=30. Iraq declared the procurement of significant quantities of precursor chemicals, production equipment, empty munitions and machinery for the production of empty munitions from abroad in the period from 1982 to 1990. Iraq also declared having had foreign assistance in the construction of several CW-production and support plants in the 1980s., 528517=3. Iraq had initial success in much of its concealment efforts, but, based, presumably, on early experience with the IAEA and the Special Commission in inspection activities, Iraq, took a subsequent decision in late June of 1991 to eliminate some of these retained proscribed materials, on its own, and in secret and in such a way that precise knowledge about what and how much had been destroyed would not be achievable. This decision and action by the high-level committee was a so-called \"unilateral destruction\". It was taken following an incident in June 1991 when IAEA inspectors, following an inspection that turned confrontational at Abu Ghraib, obtained photographic evidence of retained nuclear weapons production components., 113104=64. In early 1992, Iraq acknowledged the importation of some components for proscribed G&C systems. The Commission sought to obtain Iraq\u0092s full disclosure concerning these procurement efforts. Iraq denied most of them until August 1995. The Commission also discovered that Iraq had been receiving such components from foreign suppliers up to November 1991 i.e. several months after the adoption of resolution 687 (1991)., 343239=Ricin: Iraq asserts that 10 litres of ricin were produced from 100 kg of castor beans and that this quantity was used in a field trial using 155mm artillery shells in November 1990. Documents obtained during an inspection in 1997 indicate that far more than 100 kg of castor beans were collected and processed in October, November 1990. If the Commission had a clear understanding of Iraq\u0092s objective for including Ricin in its programme, then perhaps much of the uncertainties surrounding Ricin could be resolved., 164393=95. Iraq also retained technological and know-how documentation required for the production of proscribed missiles, in particular of the Al Hussein class. Boxes of such documentation were obtained by the Commission in August 1995 at the so-called \"Chicken farm\". The documentation included detailed plans, procedure manuals and drawings for production of proscribed missiles and their components. It should be noted that technological documentation for the final assembly of Al Hussein missiles was not found either in the boxes of August 1995 or since., 207871=agents produced, 3,315 tonnes of agents were weaponized. Iraq declared that about 80% of the weaponized CW agents were consumed in the period from 1982 to 1988. In addition, some 130 tonnes of non-weaponized CW agents were claimed to have been discarded by Iraq in the 1980s., 542545=21. Iraq did not acknowledge concealment as a legitimate matter for discussion with the Commission. Iraq stated that all concealment had been ended and only if the Commission could prove otherwise would Iraq discuss the matter. The Commission had ample evidence of concealment up to 1995 and in addition, uncovered clandestine proscribed missile guidance acquisition by Iraq in late 1995. Iraq claimed all such actions were terminated. The Commission had no evidence to support Iraq's claims, and, continued to receive reports to the contrary., 485659=The programme for biological weapons was immature in 1991. The failure of Iraq to account for its intended programme of work through 1991 and beyond also prevents the Commission from gaining a perspective of the interrelationships between the various components and so the coherence of the programme. This information will also be essential to determine if Iraq has indeed terminated its programme., 372421=Thioglycollate destroyed in 1996.Not specifically stated: implied 1848 kg, 796=For the sake of greater transparency and for the benefit of all Members of the United Nations, we should be grateful if you would have the text of the reports drawn up by the Special Commission on the current state of affairs with respect to the disarmament of Iraq's proscribed weapons and on ongoing monitoring and verification in Iraq, dated 25 January 1999, circulated as a document of the Security Council., 426593=Documents concerning the research activities have been provided to the Commission. In August 1991 some ten papers concerning the research of Dr. Rihab Taha were presented to the Commission. These focussed on the three agents Bacillus anthracis, Botulinum toxin and Clostridium perfringens. In 1995 additional information was obtained by the Commission from the Haidar Farm, including research papers that indicateed that papers released in 1991 were carefully edited to mislead the Commission. No documentation concerning research on mycotoxins, smut, viruses, plant toxins and genetic engineering were included in the documents. In 1998 eight documents concerning research, apparently involuntarily provided by Prof. Nasser Hindawi, were provided to the Commission. The documents essentially confirmed earlier papers, although one three-page document which personally reviews Prof. Nasser Hindawi\u0092s contribution to the programme, bearing the date 1989, is given great credence by Iraq as defining the scope of the programme., 277724=After Iraq\u0092s acknowledgement of its BW weapons programme , Iraq has submitted three FFCDs of its BW programme. While the first of these FFCDs was declared void by Iraq itself in August 1995, the two latter FFCDs were reviewed by panels of international experts on four occasions. In March 1997, an expert panel recommended the rejection of Iraq's June 1996 FFCD because of the inadequacy of the material presented throughout the document. In May 1997, the Commission presented formats to enable Iraq to clarify deficiencies in its biological FFCD. All areas of concern to the Commission were clearly identified and discussed with Iraq. It was expected that these issues would be seriously and comprehensively addressed by Iraq in its next FFCD. However, in September 1997, Iraq provided a new FFCD that contained essentially the same information, ignoring all advice provided to it by the Commission. As reported to the Council, an international expert panel reviewed Iraq's biological FFCD in September 1997, and considered it deficient in most aspects. In March 1998, a biological Technical Evaluation Meeting (TEM) between the Commission and Iraq took place in Vienna dealing with all aspects of the biological FFCD. The Commission\u0092s team comprised 18 experts from 15 countries., 186316=7. The Commission\u0092s accounting of the material balances of special munitions, bulk CW agents, key CW precursor and major CW production equipment are given below. The accounting is based on Iraq\u0092s declarations on its overall holdings of the above mentioned items in the period from 1982 to 1991., 246433=39. The issue most evaluated from the military aspects of the programme is the deployment of chemical munitions from the production and storage facilities to the Army and Air Force in 1991. Undertaking the issue of deployment is an effective tool to verify quantities of CW remained in Iraq prior to the beginning of the Commission\u0092s verification. The majority of Iraq\u0092s declarations on the deployment were verified up to the level of regional depots and airbases through documents provided by Iraq and physical evidence found by the Commission. Questions remain concerning Iraq\u0092s declarations on the deployment of R-400 chemical and biological aerial bombs, special warheads for the Al-Hussein missiles and 122-mm rockets., 186682=8. Iraq declared overall holdings of more than 200,000 unfilled and filled special munitions (those produced and procured for CW and BW purposes) during the entire period of the implementation of its CW programme. For the purpose of the verification of the material balance of special munitions, the Commission simultaneously attempts to account for both chemical and biological munitions, given the fact that some types of weapons originally designed for CW purposes were later filled or planned to be filled with BW agents. Special munitions include aerial bombs, artillery shells, rockets for multiple launching systems and missile warheads. According to Iraq, of the declared total holdings of more than 200,000 special munitions, about 100,000 munitions filled with CW agents were consumed or disposed of by Iraq in the period 1982 -1988., 32303=4. By the end of 1991, the Commission had completed the task of the destruction of proscribed missile weapons and materials that Iraq had chosen to declare immediately after the adoption of resolution 687 (1991). At that time, the Commission came to the conclusion that Iraq had not declared all its holding of such weapons nor disclosed all its proscribed capabilities and programmes. In March 1992, Iraq admitted that it had withheld from the Commission a considerable amount of proscribed weapons and their component, and declared that it had destroyed them unilaterally in Summer 1991 without the Commission\u0092s supervision. This unilateral destruction by Iraq was in direct violations of Security Council resolution 687 (1991)., 303157=A review by international experts of all information available to the Commission demonstrated that the account of R-400 bombs in the 1997 biological FFCD is both incomplete and inaccurate. The FFCD provides no documented account of filling. This means that a material balance for the weapons and the BW agents incorporated within them cannot be established. There is no confident upper limit on the number of bombs filled for BW purposes. There is no authenticated account of the destruction of the BW agent contained in the weapons. The possibility that such weapons remain in Iraq, cannot be precluded or that agent produced for such weapons exists in bulk storage., 23619=33. Iraq declared that 550 shells filled with mustard had been \"lost\" shortly after the Gulf War. To date, no evidence of the missing munitions has been found. Iraq claimed that the chemical warfare agents filled into these weapons would be degraded a long time ago and, therefore, there would be no need for their accounting. However, a dozen mustard-filled shells were recovered at a former CW storage facility in the period 1997-1998. The chemical sampling of these munitions, in April 1998, revealed that the mustard was still of the highest quality. After seven years, the purity of mustard ranged between 94 and 97%. Thus, Iraq has to account for these munitions which would be ready for combat use. The resolution of this specific issue would also increase confidence in accepting Iraq\u0092s other declarations on losses of chemical weapons which it has not been possible to verify., 547497=30. In July 1998, an inspection sought to uncover information related to Iraq's production, storage, and disposal of chemical and biological weapons. Iraq had long denied that any documents on these topics were available. In the course of the team's inspection of Iraqi Air Force Headquarters inspectors located a document detailing the use of \"special weapons\" during the Iran - Iraq war. Immediately after its discovery, the document was seized from the Chief Inspector. Iraq has not responded to the demand, expressed by the Security Council, to return the document. Information in the document, recorded by team members, shows significant discrepancies between the amount of munitions Iraq claims to have consumed between 1983 and 1988, and the actual amount presented by Iraq in its official declarations., 327002=LD-250 Aerial Bomb: Static trials of LD-250 aerial bombs to disperse agents were conducted in 1988. It is likely that further such trials were conducted. These tests were considered successful. Despite this, and the adoption of the weapon for CW agent delivery, it is claimed that no further development occurred., 111975=62. As verifiable material balances of proscribed engine components can not be established, either component wise or by aggregate weight, additional inspections were conducted in 1997 and 1998 to assess Iraq\u0092s technical capabilities in missile engine production. International experts, invited by the Commission for a meeting in Baghdad in July 1998, came to an assessment that, by the end of 1990, Iraq had the capability to assemble a limited number of proscribed liquid propellant engines for Al Hussein class missiles but was still experiencing production related problems. The international experts also assessed that Iraq needed to account for the key components of its missile engine programme., 188197=a) 56,281 munitions [22,263 filled munitions and 34,018 unfilled munitions] declared by Iraq as having remained after the 1991 Gulf war:, 290600=Iraq asserts that all 25 BW warheads were unilaterally destroyed at specific locations at Al-Nibai desert in July 1991. To verify the FFCD, the Commission in 1998 took samples from the remnants of agent warhead containers excavated from various locations at Al-Nibai. The results of the analyses do not support the statements made in Iraq's FFCD. Traces of Bacillus anthracis spores have been identified on remnants of containers from at least seven distinct missile warheads as opposed to the five declared. There are discrepancies between the Iraqi account of where groups of warheads containing particular BW agents were destroyed and the results of the analyses. This throws doubt on the accounts of weapons filling, deployment and subsequent destruction., 13900=20. Notwithstanding the fundamental sources of difficulty described above, and building on both its past achievements and the substantial body of knowledge of Iraq's proscribed programmes the Commission assembled, in June of 1998, and indicated, first to the Security Council and then to Iraq, what it believed to be the remaining priority issues in disarmament, in particular as regards proscribed weapons. This reflected the Commission\u0092s understanding of the desire of the Council to focus on selected important parts of the requirements of its resolutions. The methodology used in drawing up this list was to focus on unaccounted proscribed weapons and to set aside other aspects such as fully verifying production capacities, research activities, etc. Satisfactory resolution of the specific \"priority issues\" would make it easier to conclude that other unverified elements were of lesser substantive importance. Conversely, the inability of Iraq to satisfy these issues would point to more ominous explanations for other unverified parts of Iraq\u0092s declarations. Whether these other parts will ultimately be addressed is an open question, but one which has a direct bearing upon confidence in future monitoring., 589773=18. The main missile activity in Iraq under monitoring by the Commission since 1994 has been the development of a missile, with a declared range of just below 150 kilometres, for indigenous production in Iraq. This missile system, known variably as Ababil-100 or the Samoud, has been under development in both liquid and solid propellant versions., 208922=16. The material balance of 412.5 tonnes of bulk CW agents remaining in Iraq as of January 1991 is provided in table 2., 8477=12. Three basic points about this disarmament record need to be made. First, the overall period of the Commission's disarmament work must be divided into two parts, separated by the events following the departure from Iraq, in August 1995, of Lt. General Hussein Kamal. This which resulted in the provision to the Commission of an extensive cache of documents on Iraq\u0092s prohibited programmes. These documents and subsequent disclosures by Iraq indicated that, during the first four years of its activities, the Commission had been very substantially misled by Iraq both in terms of its understanding of Iraq\u0092s proscribed weapons programmes and the continuation of prohibited activities, even under the Commission\u0092s monitoring. Positive conclusions on Iraq\u0092s compliance reported to the Council previously by the Commission had to be revised. They were conclusions generally based on accepting Iraq\u0092s declarations at face value. Analysis of the new material shaped the direction of the Commission\u0092s subsequent work including the emphasis on: obtaining verifiable evidence including physical materials or documents; investigation of the successful concealment activities by Iraq; and, the thorough verification of the unilateral destruction events., 107611=60. Based on information provided by Iraq in July 1998, the aggregate weight of components and production tools/dies for missile engine production that were declared as having been unilaterally destroyed, were estimated to be around 108 tonnes. A rough material balance, by weight, of unilaterally destroyed components for indigenous missile engine production is presented in Table 10:, 544678=25. In June 1997, the Commission experienced delays and obstructions throughout the inspections including the removal of material from sites. The friction in conducting such inspections of sites is in some ways understandable given the sensitivity of such locations and organizations to Iraq. But, given the information about concealment practices and the absence of evidence about their termination, the Commission believed it had no choice but to continue. Ultimately, it was hoped that Iraq would provide a full and verifiable presentation on concealment. Inspections, while useful, would ultimately be blocked rather than permit discovery of prohibited materials. Nevertheless, evidence of non-compliance with the inspection regime was demonstrated in the form of non-cooperation. Missing files, cleansed rooms, purged computers and other techniques were encountered on a regular basis, at sites under inspection., 330128=Bulk warfare agent production appears to be considerably understated by Iraq. Production accounts are incompatible with resources available to Iraq's BW programme, including growth media and fermentor capacity. Production figures in the FFCD remain unsupported from 1987 to 1989 and 1991. The sole supporting document, for 1990, differs from information contained in the FFCD itself. Experts' calculations of possible agent production quantities, either by equipment capacity or by growth media amounts, far exceed Iraq's stated results. Significant periods when the fermentors were claimed not to be utilized are unexplained, especially for a period after August 1990, when Iraq's BW production facilities were ordered to operate at their maximum capacity. Stated low productivity of readily available equipment has not been adequately explained. The idle times for fermentor utilization and low productivity, which are technically not credible, cast doubt on the elemental credibility of the 1997 FFCD., 185740=6. Iraq also declared that the majority of its CW production facilities were destroyed during the 1991 Gulf war by the aerial bombardment, as well as certain quantities of CW and their precursors. The Commission\u0092s verification of the proscribed materials remaining after the Gulf war was further complicated due to the unilateral destruction of significant quantities of special munitions and precursor chemicals carried out by Iraq. Iraq conducted this unilateral destruction in the summer of 1991, in direct contravention of the Security Council' s resolutions., 113541=65. In 1992, Iraq declared that it had unilaterally destroyed components and tooling from its guidance and control programme by disposing them in rivers or melting them in foundries. Based on the evidence presented by Iraq at that time and due to the lack of supporting documentation, the Commission was not able to verify the quantities of proscribed items declared as having been unilaterally destroyed. The Commission also assessed that not all items declared by Iraq to have been unilaterally destroyed in 1991, had in fact been destroyed at that time. In 1996, Iraq admitted that some items for its G&C production programme had been diverted from the previously declared unilateral destruction in 1991. Iraq stated that items thus concealed had been retained until March 1992, at which time they were secretly destroyed despite the fact that Iraq had already disclosed unilateral destruction of some other items from its proscribed missile activities. Iraq provided partial inventory lists to account for the unilateral destruction. The Commission sought to verify this information by interviews, discussions and inspections during 1996 and 1997. Iraq was unable to produce credible explanations or evidence of the complete destruction., 367008=During the destruction of Al-Hakam in 1996, 22 tons of media were collected from several facilities and destroyed under the Commission supervision. However some of the 22 tons (unquantifiable) probably came from sources external to the BW programme i.e. some of the media from the original orders is still unaccounted for. It is also uncertain whether all the media acquired for the programme has been identified. Thus there is little confidence that all the media associated with the programme has been located and destroyed., 244642=36. However, it was not possible to verify the full extent of several R& D projects carried out by Iraq from 1989 to 1990, due to the absence of sufficient data from documents and other verifiable evidence. Those include the research on new chemical warfare agents, BZ and Soman. These also include Iraq\u0092s efforts to develop new delivery means for CW-agents, such as special warheads other than for Al-Hussein missiles, i.e. FROG missile, and real binary artillery munitions and aerial bombs. Evidence of such studies was found in the documents from the Haider farm. On the other hand, the Commission did not find evidence that Iraq had reached the stage of industrial production of these materials and items., 291538=In response to this evidence, in July 1998, Iraq changed its account of BW warhead and other munitions filling. It stated to an Commission team that, instead of the declared five Bacillus anthracis spores and 16 botulinum toxin warheads, there had been in fact 16 Bacillus anthracis spores and five botulinum toxin missile warheads. Iraq insisted that this change in disclosure would not affect Iraq's declaration on the total quantity of BW agents produced and weaponized. These changes also included alterations to the numbers of R-400 aerial bombs filled with Bacillus anthracis spores and botulinum toxin. Iraq did not present any supporting documents or other specific evidence to substantiate the new statement. In the original account, Iraq emphatically asserted that all ten weapons in the Al-Mansuriyah railway tunnel were filled with Bacillus anthracis spores and only later was this adjusted to botulinum toxin., 423066=At Al-Salman some fundamental research work on the enhancement of the toxicity and virulence of agents was also undertaken, some in conjunction with Al-Muthanna. Research on the scale up of agent production was undertaken and the searches for cheap efficient growth materials were undertaken, not all of which have been disclosed in the FFCD although both testimony by Iraq's experts and documents indicate activity undertaken. Studies on the storage and preservation of both seed stocks and bulk agents were undertaken. The effects of Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium perfringens spores were also determined. The rationale for this is not presented in the FFCD and no one accepts responsibility for the scientific and technical basis for this expansion other than Dr. Ahmed Murthada who by his own acknowledgement merely administered the programme. The relationship of the parent organization to Al-Muthanna, the Scientific Research Council, the University of Baghdad, the Iraqi Atomic Energy Agency and the Central Library of Iraq have not been defined. The extent of the research programme remains to be presented. In 1985, 1986, and 1988 a range of defined seed stocks of BW agents were acquired, some of which are not recorded as being a component of the BW programme., 444451=The biological agent was stored in a bunker and a warehouse at Al-Hakam. The hardened bunker was capable of housing some twenty 5000 litres containers. Just four are acknowledged to have been manufactured and two were placed in the bunker and two were placed in the warehouse. It is not clear how many more 5000 litre containers were made or planned to be fabricated. The containers were specifically designed for pathogen storage and subsequent sterilisation. Containers with a capacity of 1000 litres, which were wheeled and so mobile, were also manufactured. Although the precise number made is uncertain it appears that at least 39 were made in 1989 and 1990. Some 70 were planned to be fabricated. These would serve both as storage and transfer vessels. The total planned storage capability is difficult to ascertain but it is probably in the region of 80,000 to 100,000 litres of agent., 197469=2) Of those, 29 warheads were destroyed by Iraq under UNSCOM supervision during 1992 and 1993, and, 424529=In 1989 much of the research group and its attendant research was transferred to Al-Hakam where experiments on weapons materials compatibility was undertaken as well as quality control on BW agents produced at the industrial scale. The scale of the research work was further extended. In 1990 additional research locations were obtained at the Foot and Mouth Disease Vaccine Institute at Daura and apparently the Agriculture and Water Resources Centre at Fudhaliyah. Research on viruses was started by Dr. Hazem Ali and genetic engineering with Dr. Ali Nuria Abdel Hussein. The logic and intent for the selection of camelpox virus, infectious haemorrhagic conjunctivitis virus, and rotavirus are not stated in the FFCD. The objectives for the genetic engineering unit are not elaborated upon although testimony of Dr. Rihab Taha has indicated initially antibiotic resistant strains of Bacillus anthracis spores were to have been derived. Any relationship with that of the genetic engineering section of Al-Muthanna housed at the Serum and Vaccine Institute at Amiriyah under the direction of Dr. Al-Za\u0092ag is denied., 379406=The material balance pertaining to media cannot be established. There are several factors which introduce uncertainty. On imports, Iraq\u0092s declaration understates the amount by at least 600 kg. Furthermore there is no documentation for the quantities of media said to have been acquired locally, nor any evidence whether this was the total amount. On media consumed, Iraq acknowledges that the figures it presents are derived from estimates of the quantity of agent produced. Since there is little supporting documentation relating to the quantities of agents produced, the amount of each type of media consumed carries similar uncertainties. On losses, Iraq\u0092s account of substantial amounts of media said to be lost during the evacuation of Al-Hakam cannot be quantified and furthermore the account of the theft of media from the school house, is probably untrue. The only fixed point in the material balance equation for bacterial growth media is the amount of imported media. Some more data can be derived from the amount of media destroyed by the Commission in 1996. However in relation to yeast extract and peptone there is considerable uncertainty in the destruction of the media. The majority of containers had been previously opened by Iraq and the Commission\u0092s assessment of their contents was complicated by mis-labelled media, other sources of media possibly being added and duplicate labels. In particular for peptone, the Commission\u0092s assessment of the media destroyed varies between 200 and 470 kg depending on the assumptions made with regard to labelling. This compares with 625 kg implied in the FFCD as having been destroyed. For all the above reasons, the material balance for bacterial growth media cannot be verified., 17841=27. The Commission found that Iraq\u0092s explanations on procedures and methods of unilateral destruction of the special warheads were, in general, plausible. In one aspect related to the destruction of BW warheads, the Commission, after consulting a group of international experts, assessed that Iraq\u0092s declaration that 15 warheads had been destroyed simultaneously conflicted with physical evidence collected at the declared location of their unilateral destruction. This finding indicated that not all BW warheads had been destroyed at the same time as claimed by Iraq and that Iraq had retained some BW warheads after the date of the declared July 1991 unilateral destruction. Obviously, any retained warheads after the declared destruction date would be an indication that not all proscribed missiles for such warheads were destroyed as claimed by Iraq. The discrepancies between Iraq\u0092s declarations and the physical evidence collected need to be resolved. In addition, the Commission\u0092s investigations showed that, despite repeated attempts, Iraq had not provided the true locations of the hiding, immediately prior to the declared unilateral destruction, of at least half of the special warheads including abovementioned 15 BW warheads. Iraq\u0092s continuous inability to disclose hide sites of the special warheads has also prevented the Commission from verification of the declared unilateral destruction of the special warheads., 247475=41. Military requirements are important to assess credibly Iraq\u0092s declarations on types and quantities of CW produced. The only document of this nature provided by Iraq to the Special Commission was the request of the Ministry of Defense for CW for 1988. According to Iraq, this request detailing types and quantities of CW needed was used as a basis for the production of different CW agents and munitions in 1990., 609719=55. Pursuant to the Plan for OMV, in particular its paragraph 43(a), the Commission monitors specified operational missiles in Iraq to ensure that they are not modified for prohibited purposes. Since mid-1994, 22 non-resident teams went to Iraq to conduct inspections for this purpose. A more detailed discussion of relevant issues is presented in a section below dealing with operational missiles., 443587=The Al-Hakam Factory is acknowledged to have been built with the objectives of undertaking research and development together with industrial scale production of BW agents. Dr. Rihab Taha has also stated that weapons filling at Al Hakam was also considered for the future. Iraq states that weapons were filled for experimental field tests in 1990 at Al-Hakam and R-400 bombs were assembled at Al-Hakam in preparation for their subsequent filling (which apparently occurred at Al-Muthanna) and their subsequent deployment. Consideration of weapons assembly, filling and storage (empty and full) would have been a part of the consideration of Al-Hakam in 1987/88 as would the storage of bulk agent and the media required to produce such agents., 240299=2) 75 pieces of broken equipment damaged during the 1991 Gulf war were accounted for by UNSCOM., 625700=85. Since 1994, the Commission has carried out 22 inspections related to tagging and checking operational missiles under monitoring. This includes 14 \"annual\" checks carried out pursuant to the established modalities. The Commission has not identified any evidence of proscribed modification of the tagged missiles., 619587=75. Upon receipt of declarations and notifications from Iraq, the Commission assesses them, updates its relevant databases and conducts, through resident and non-resident teams, a verification of their completeness and accuracy. Assessment and verification of Iraq\u0092s declarations in the missile area is quite an enormous task. Each time they are submitted, semi-annual declarations alone contain some 1000 pages. Additional declarations and notifications, including on missile tests and equipment movement, are frequent and require follow-up actions on the part of the Commission., 675773=9. Reviews of semi-annual declarations are carried out following the receipt of the declarations every January and July. The declarations are analysed and verified through on-site inspection and comparative examination. The verification takes place in the period directly following the submission of the declaration, in an attempt to determine the completeness and accuracy of the data submitted and to confirm the information included in the declaration., 22602=32. In July 1998 during an inspection the Commission found a document which detailed the consumption of special munitions by Iraq in the 1980s. Iraq took the document from the Chief Inspector and did not return it to the Commission despite demands by Security Council that it do so. The figures in this document indicate serious discrepancies with Iraq\u0092s declarations on the expenditure of CW-munitions in the 1980s. According to this document, Iraq consumed about 6,000 chemical aerial bombs less than it is stated in its declarations. This invalidates the starting point of the Commission\u0092s accounting for chemical weapons which remained in 1991. The provision by Iraq of this document together with clarifications of the discrepancies is required to increase the degree of confidence with respect to Iraq\u0092s declarations of chemical weapons which remained in Iraq in 1991 and their disposition., 361576=Thus the difference between the quantity of media imported and that remaining in stock in 1991, i.e., the shortfall, accounted for by Kimadia, represents the media consumed in the Iraqi BW programme between 1988 and June 1991. This provides a snapshot in time immediately following the stated end of the BW programme and potentially is a figure that can be used in the verification of Iraq\u0092s FFCD. The picture however became confused in July 1998 when Iraq stated that not all the media left over from the programme was transferred to Kimadia, but certain amounts (undocumented) were retained at Al-Hakam. Thus the Kimadia \"shortfall\" figures would reflect media consumed in the programme plus any remaining at Al-Hakam in 1991. If this is the case then the Kimadia documents become less useful as a verification tool. Furthermore some of the data from the Kimadia documents is in conflict with the FFCD. In discussions with Iraq during an inspection in December 1998, the issue of what quantity of media remained in 1991, became more unsettled. Iraq submitted \"copies of documents\" that casts further doubt on the usefulness of the \"Kimadia documents\" for verification. The \"copies\" provided during this inspection cast further doubt, however, may not be valid copies., 401737=Iraq claims that the programme started in 1974 by Presidential decree and by the establishment of the Al-Hazen Institute. Interview evidence shows that consideration of a programme was earlier, as evidenced by the establishment of a functional purpose-built scientific research complex by mid 1974. Planning, design and construction of such a complex would had to have started at least in 1973 with concepts developed earlier. The affiliation of the Institute is not defined other than to a \"State Security Organization\"., 445514=Al-Hakam was intended to accommodate, in 1988, three five-cubic metre fermentors in the first instance. According to a document provided by Iraq two such fermentors were planned to produce Agent A (botulinum toxin) and one for Agent B (Bacillus anthracis spores). This is described as industrial scale production and implicit is that it satisfied the minimum military requirement for Iraq. No account of this requirement has been made. In the event the fermentation line from the Al-Kindi Company was installed comprising seven 1480 litre fermentors and two 1850 litre fermentors (i.e., a total of 14060 litres) which is a similar overall volume confirming the operational scale requirement. Operating at a 5-day cycle about 820,000 litres of agent could be produced per year equivalent to 82000 litres of 10-fold concentrated agent. Assuming an annual replenishment of agent it would appear the initial annual capacity of the factory would be about 80,000 litres. When both areas A and B of the large scale plant became functional the capacity would in essence double and remain at that level until the far larger capability in area D came on stream., 550728=3. Iraq refused to acknowledge resolution 715 (1991) for two years. It was not until Iraq officially acknowledged it, on 26 November 1993, that real efforts to design and build the full OMV system could start., 162008=91. These findings are based on evidence obtained by the Commission and information provided by Iraq itself since August 1995. They may indicate the origin of remaining gaps in the material balances of proscribed items as presented in this report. The following provides a brief description of the main established cases of activities, after April 1991, in contravention of Iraq\u0092s obligations under Security Council resolutions 687 (1991) and 715 (1991)., 189006=b) 41,998 munitions [5,498 filled munitions and 36,500 unfilled munitions] declared by Iraq as having been destroyed during the 1991 Gulf war:, 483619=Iraq fails on a number of levels to present a clear account of its programme. At the senior level there is no indication of the determination of a requirement for such weapons and planning for the acquisition and deployment of the weapons. At the management level there is no indication of how the requirement was to be met and how resources were acquired and utilized to fulfil the military need. In particular the scale and scope of the Al-Hakam Factory are not explained or justified; the inevitable weapons development programme to ensure effective BW agent dissemination is not presented at all. At the working level there is no rationale presented for research and development, or the industrial scale production of agent (especially before August 1990). The repeated statement by a senior Iraqi Government representative, that the programme was a minor programme, essentially run by unsupervised technicians who had an unrealistic programme of work, trivialises a serious programme of work and does nothing to help the Commission gain the appreciation of that programme. The denial of planning for the programme, contrary to the evidence, means that the basic coherence for the programme cannot be established., 191676=After the 1991 Gulf war, 117963=71. Iraq originally denied that it had any project to produce Al Hussein class missile propellants from raw material in Iraq. During its verification effort, the Commission learned that contrary to Iraq\u0092s statements, there had been a project, prior to the Gulf War, to construct a dedicated facility in Iraq to produce proscribed missile propellants. Documents found in August 1995 confirmed the validity of this information. The documents also revealed that the implementation of the project had continued after the adoption of resolution 687 (1991) in April 1991. After the Commission presented its evidence to Iraq, Iraq admitted, in 1996, that such a project had existed and its construction had continued after April 1991. Iraq explained that the completion of the construction of the project\u0092s buildings had been accomplished after April 1991 as a part of the \"reconstruction campaign\" and the project had not been fully implemented due to technical difficulties in the procurement of some equipment. The site is currently used by Iraq for the production of solvents and cleaning solutions and it is currently under the Commission\u0092s monitoring., 441130=Such an account would correspond to one of the few tangible aspects of the programme which can be unambiguously presented - the actual buildings created and used. All that is provided in the FFCD is a physical description of some components. It does not relate activity undertaken or required to facilities available. Iraq has provided 23 site diagrams with little commentary after the Vienna Technical Evaluation Meeting (12 May, 1998) in response to the criticism., 171329=103. Available evidence revealed that Lt. General Hussein Kamil had a meeting with senior engineers in May 1993 to assess missile activities ongoing in Iraq at that time. Notes taken of the meeting indicated that among the issues discussed were a turbo pump to feed four Volga/SA2 missile engine combustion chambers and a design of the engine for a \"larger missile\". These activities were not declared to the Commission at that time. Such activities could have been of a proscribed nature., 121751=74. Iraq declared that it had never been successful in commissioning the production or integration facilities it had been building, nor in manufacturing any complete BADR 2000 missiles, nor had it received from abroad any operational missiles of this system., 231468=75 broken pieces of equipment damaged during the 1991 Gulf war were accounted for by UNSCOM,, 469780=The FFCD portrays Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Hassan as the sole key decision-maker and controller of the BW programme after 1987. Links between Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Hassan, the MOD and other organizations are vehemently denied. It is assessed by the Commission that such links must have existed. Without such links, understanding how Iraq defined its military requirement and planned the use of its BW weapons, is difficult., 314100=The drop-tank project appears to have been pursued with the utmost vigour by Iraq. It seems to have been the only BW weapon system that continued in development after the start of the Gulf war. Two mobile tanks for bulk BW agents, each with a capacity of 1000 litres, were found buried at the Al-Azzizziyah outstation of Abou Obeydi. This raises questions about the state of readiness of this weapon system. Iraq will not discuss the details of concepts of use and flatly refuses to acknowledge the plan for this project., 205762=2) In the period from 1997 to 1998, remnants of 3 additional warheads declared as special training warheads were recovered., 44605=17. In late 1995, Iraq provided to the Commission an inventory of missiles destroyed unilaterally. This inventory contained a reference to seven indigenously produced missiles, in addition to the 85 imported missiles. The November 1997 emergency session determined that accounting for these seven missiles was one of the priority requirements. The Commission has not been able to verify the nature and destruction of these missiles. (For more details, see Section 2, below), 267913=Iraq has not provided evidence concerning the termination of its offensive BW programme. The evidence collected by the Commission and the absence of information from Iraq, raises serious doubts about Iraq\u0092s assertion that the BW programme was truly \"obliterated\" in 1991 as it claims., 335361=Bacillus anthracis spores, Agent B: It is not possible to verify the amount of Agent B placed into munitions or otherwise consumed as presented in the 1997 FFCD. UNSCOM cannot exclude the production of Agent B from facilities other than Al-Hakam based on analytical evidence of Bacillus anthracis spores in equipment (one fermentor and two tanks) located at the FMD facility at Daura. An Iraqi explanation for this finding presented during the inspection was not credible. Overall, bulk agent production quantities and the location of production of Agent B cannot be determined because of the lack of sufficient supporting documentation., 215957=in 1991, 620181=76. The Commission\u0092s confidence in Iraq\u0092s compliance depends significantly on the openness, accuracy and completeness of Iraq\u0092s declarations. The Commission\u0092s experience with Iraq\u0092s declarations in the missile area is that they have been generally complete and correct. On several occasions, the Commission has noted Iraq\u0092s reluctance to declare, at an early stage, activities which should be under monitoring. An example is Iraq\u0092s acquisition of a facility for the production of Ammonium Perchlorate (APC), a missile propellant listed in Annex IV in the Plan for OMV. Iraq began the development for this facility in 1995, without providing a notification to the Commission. Through an on-site inspection of a \"non-listed\" site, the Commission first detected such activity in early 1996 when it discovered a pilot plant for the production of APC. In late 1997, Iraq notified the Commission that it had begun the construction of a full-scale facility for the APC production. Such delayed disclosures disrupt the smooth functioning of the monitoring system., 599848=38. One way to collect the data required to assess Iraq\u0092s compliance is to monitor, throughout Iraq, equipment and other items that could be used by Iraq in proscribed missile activities or in undisclosed activities that Iraq is required to declare under the Plan for OMV. The Plan established a list of dual-use items for the missile area. This list constitutes Annex IV to the Plan. The Annex contains technical definitions of equipment, components, items, materials and technologies that are considered important to develop and produce proscribed missiles in Iraq. The list was subsequently revised to elaborate specific items which would be subject to Export/Import monitoring. Modifications to the list were mainly based on an internationally accepted missile non-proliferation regime, the Missile Technology Control Regime. This modified Annex IV was approved by the Security Council in March 1995. Further modifications may be expected in the future in the light of experience., 39710=14. Iraq declared that it imported 819 long-range combat missiles that fall under prohibitions established by resolution 687 (1991). Over half of them were modified by Iraq, since 1987, into missiles known in Iraq as Al Hussein class missiles. Al Hussein missiles used by Iraq during recent wars had a range of some 650 kilometres., 350462=2200 litres, 405341=The establishment of the BW research group at Al-Salman in 1987 is accepted as stated although the means by which it was established and managed is far from clear. The relationship of the programme within TRC to other organizations is unclear. The responsibility and management for the expansion of the programme to include mycotoxins in 1987/88 and viruses and genetic engineering in 1990 has not been defined adequately., 266480=From 1987 onwards Iraq undertook pilot and industrial scale production of BW agents. Iraq denies any parallel activity to develop weapons capable of delivering the BW agents it was producing. During inspections, Iraq has stated that its policy was to evaluate weapons that had been developed for Chemical Warfare (CW) purposes, to establish whether they could be adapted for BW agents. It is difficult to accept that Iraq claims it had not initiated a BW-specific weapons programme in the late 80's, possibly in the MIC Naval and Aerial Bombs Section, in order that efficient and effective dissemination weapons be made available. It is not clear whether such weapons have been developed and are not disclosed, or have been partly developed, not reaching a stage where they could be manufactured., 76105=43. Iraq began the reverse engineering and production of Al Hussein class missiles in 1987. Its efforts included the acquisition and assembly/production of all airframe components (fuel and oxidizer tanks, engine covers, instrument compartments and warheads), guidance and control instruments and their components, and liquid propellant engines. By the time of the adoption of resolution 687 (1991), Iraq had achieved considerable progress, including successful testing of indigenously assembled engines, airframes, and some guidance and control instruments. In 1995, Iraq declared for the first time that it conducted four flight tests of missiles with indigenously manufactured engines, all of them in 1990. Iraq has declared that it was successful in the indigenous production of the whole missile airframe and warhead as well as missile launchers., 391=S/1999/94, 532218=8. One example concerns the destruction of launchers. Iraq claimed until August 1997 (including in its missile FFCD) that proscribed missile launchers were destroyed in July 1991. When the Commission attempted to confirm this by examining imagery, it found such claimed destruction did not take place. Only then did Iraq shift its claim and say that the destruction did not take place until October of 1991. Thus, Iraq changed the account given repeatedly to the Commission, for six years, without any credible explanation as to why it had deliberately given a false declaration in the first place. Two obvious consequences for the Commission's investigations are: the need to explore the reason for such deceptions; and, to demand more information in order to be able to verify other Iraqi claims., 208155=14. The Special Commission reported to the Security Council (S/1997/774 of 6 October 1997) that Iraq\u0092s declarations on its total production and holdings of CW agents could not be verified fully due to the absence of sufficient evidence provided by Iraq and its former foreign suppliers of the procurement of CW precursor chemicals, production and weaponization of CW agents prior to 1988., 609050=54. It is important to keep track of the technological progress of Iraq\u0092s industries to ensure that the ongoing monitoring is properly focused. Technology update inspection teams go to Iraq, usually on a semi-annual basis, to assess advancements in the technology base and to make recommendations for improvements in the monitoring system. Inspectors on such teams bring fresh perspectives on missile related developments and on the application of emerging technologies for monitoring purposes. Technology update inspections are critical to keeping the monitoring system in the missile area up-to-date. There have been seven such teams in Iraq since 1994., 171843=104. Iraq declared that work on the turbo pump to feed simultaneously four Volga/SA2 missile engine combustion chambers actually started at the beginning of 1995. Assistance from abroad had been sought by Iraq for this project. Iraq stated that the effort achieved no tangible results. According to the Commission\u0092s assessment, a single stage missile with four engines of this type could have a range in excess of the permitted limit of 150 kilometres., 402897=Before the apparent \"resurrection\" of the programme in 1985 work continued at Al-Salman to create resource for biological purposes including buildings established for the Institute including an animal house. Prof. Nasser Hindawi submitted a proposal for BW research in the early 1980s. The date on which the Director of Al-Muthanna Establishment (Gen. Nizar Attar) formally requested the addition of a BW research is not indicated., 419163=The Commission's understanding of the early years of Iraq's BW programme at the Al-Hazen Institute in the 1970s is poor. It is not credible that a single individual is portrayed as being solely responsible for initiating and planning the research programme. A military input is also denied, although it is acknowledged that officers from the Chemical Corps were members of the staff. A clear definition of the success, or possibly lack of it, is necessary because both outcomes would influence future development of the programme. A full account of the extent of the Al-Hazen programme has not been presented in the FFCD although this programme was offensive in nature. Subsequent clarification (12 May, 1998) provides some further background information but still fails to indicate the strategic planning that initiated a BW programme within Iraq., 446843=The site was used for the testing of weapons in 1990 and parts of the location lend themselves to experimental weapons tests away from the main production areas. As acknowledged the site is sufficiently remote to minimise contamination in the case of an accident and implicit is that it can be used for agent simulant testing., 530582=6. Iraq undertook active deception measures, during the Commission\u0092s verification of the unilateral destruction, such as \"seeding\" warhead destruction areas with parts unrelated to special warheads to lead the Commission's team to believe it had accounted for all that was claimed to exist. At that time, Iraq also melted down weapons and components to make impossible accurate identification or quantification of them. Because of Iraq's false declarations, the Commission was not in a position in 1992 to question, fully, Iraq's accounts. It was only later, after 1995, that the Commission became aware of the concerted deception efforts and was forced to reexamine the 1991-1992 period., 16691=26. Analysis at the laboratories designated by the Commission has detected the presence of degradation products of nerve agents, in particular VX, on a number of warhead remnants which had been excavated at the sites of the unilateral destruction. The October 1998 meeting of international experts convened by the Commission concluded that \"the existence of VX degradation products conflicts with Iraq\u0092s declarations that the unilaterally destroyed special warheads had never been filled with any chemical warfare agents. The findings by all three laboratories of chemicals known to be degradation products of decontamination compounds also do not support Iraq\u0092s declarations that those warhead containers had only been in contact with alcohols.\" Clarification by Iraq of these issues as recommended by the meeting would allow the Commission to make a determination whether or not the current assessment of the quantity of special warheads identified amongst the remnants excavated, accounts for all special warheads declared to have been produced by Iraq and provides for the verification of their unilateral destruction., 394652=Iraq, under SCR 687 (1991), is required to declare the locations, amounts and types of all biological weapons and all stocks of agents and all related subsystems and components and all research, development, support and manufacturing facilities. In SCR 707 (1991) this requirement was reaffirmed and the Council demanded that Iraq provide a full, final and complete disclosure on all areas related to its BW programme. Part I of this status report reviews those elements of the FFCD that are directly relevant to a material balance. Part II reviews additional elements of the FFCD. The biological TEM conducted in Vienna in 1998 indicated the significance of those issues and it was stated in the expert report: \"The FFCD also does not provide a clear understanding of the current status of the BW programme or wether, or when, it was terminated.\" In April 1998, the Commission\u0092s report to the Security Council (S/1998/223) further underlined the significance of these issues by listing the history, the organization, acquisition and research and development among the priority issues to be resolved with regard to the proscribed biological weapons programme., 581859=5. In November 1993, Iraq decided to accept the obligations set forth in resolution 715 (1991) and to comply with the provisions of the Plan for monitoring and verification as contained therein., 316702=Apart from one letter, thanking the project workers, all the information on this matter stems from interviews. However, there is a lack of evidence. The accounts given of the project are credible, when dealing with its technical aspects. When the management of the project, its place in the BW programme and the concepts of use of the weapon are considered, the accounts are contradictory and have changed between 1995 and the summer 1998. The FFCD gives abbreviated details of this project. No mention is made of the intended use of the pilotless aircraft for the dissemination of BW agent., 537612=15. One notable document received from Iraq in August 1995 should be mentioned. \"The al-Atheer Center for the development of materials production: Report of achievements accomplished from 1 June 1990 to 7 June 1991\" (called \"the al-Atheer document\"). It illustrates how this key facility for the development of nuclear weapon devices implemented the instructions of the high level committee in April 1991 on concealment action. The facility was instructed to remove evidence of the true activities at the facility, evacuate documents to hide sites, make physical alterations to the site to hide its true purpose, develop cover stories, and conduct mock inspections to prepare for UN inspectors. These types of actions are precisely what the Commission has encountered in its inspection activities throughout its work in Iraq. Iraq has claimed such deliberate concealment activities were ceased in 1995. However, Iraq has provided no documentation to substantiate these claims and the Commission continues to find evidence that the opposite is the case. Documents are found occasionally and reports from inside Iraq indicate continuing attempts to prevent the Commission from discovering documents or other materials., 704640=31. Since the establishment of the monitoring system in mid-1994, the Commission has had a requirement for staff to support its monitoring operations in Iraq. This staff is currently composed of personnel from a number of governments as well as a small group of United Nations staff stationed in New York, Baghdad and Bahrain., 188508=16,263 munitions were not destroyed, but nevertheless accounted for by UNSCOM. These include 15,616 unfilled munitions which were converted by Iraq for conventional weapons purposes in 1993-1994. These also include 438 filled munitions destroyed, according to Iraq, during a fire accident., 431=29 January 1999, 404828=In reality the Commission assesses that the transfer of the BW work from Al-Muthanna to Al-Salman (TRC) was to preserve secrecy. Al-Muthanna still had a requirement for the agents produced at Al-Taji and subsequently at Al-Hakam for field tests. Al-Muthanna continued to collaborate on both laboratory and field experiments from 1987 to 1991., 302353=Evidence of the destruction of three botulinum toxin filled R-400 bombs was found in 1997 when and remnants of another 20 R-400 bombs in the same area were identified. Remnants of another 25 R-400 bombs were also found in 1991, by a Commission inspection team, at a time when Iraq was declaring a total of only 40 R-400 bombs (stated to be all CW) at Al-Azzizziyah. It cannot be determined whether all these weapons had ever been filled. The figure of \"157\" R-400 bombs is based on a document provided by Iraq that suggests that 157 were destroyed. There is no evidence to support that these were in fact biological bombs., 274584=Iraq\u0092s offensive BW programme was among the most secretive of its programmes of weapons of mass destruction. Its existence was not acknowledged until July 1995. During the period from 1991 to 1995 Iraq categorically denied it had a biological weapons programme and it took active steps to conceal the programme from the Special Commission. These included fraudulent statements, false and forged documents, misrepresentation of the roles of people and facilities and other specific acts of deception. For example, Iraq claims to have destroyed much of the documentation and overt evidence of the programme. At the same time Iraq maintained other aspects of the programme such as the equipment, supplies (e.g., bacterial growth media), and personnel as an intact entity and facilities of the programme such as the Al-Hakam facility that produced BW agents., 342585=Bacillus thuringiensis spores, simulant for Bacillus anthracis spores drying: Iraq cites the production of ~50 litres of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) spores in March 1990 for drying studies which are claimed not to have been done because of a failure to obtain a particular spray dryer. However, Bt spores were taken by Iraq to the supplier in December 1989 to test on the spray dryer it planned to acquire. The quantity of Bt spores produced can not be verified., 489024=In mid-1995 Iraq admitted that it had possessed a BW programme. Since then, Iraq has often stated that its BW programme was \u0091obliterated\u0092 in 1991. Officials cite, as proof of this, the unilateral demolition of the deployed BW weapons, deactivation of bulk BW agents and the destruction some documents associated with the programme. Despite these activities in 1991, Iraq retained the facilities, growth media, equipment and groupings of core technical personnel at Al-Hakam, while denying the very existence of any BW programme., 590128=19. Since the missile monitoring system was established in 1994, Iraq has achieved considerable progress in the development of the Samoud liquid propellant missile system with a declared range of 149 kilometres. A number of static tests of missile engines were conducted. In October 1997, Iraq carried out its first declared flight test of a Samoud missile. This flight test was declared a success by Iraq and demonstrated a significant step in Iraq\u0092s indigenous missile production capabilities. Iraq continued active flight test activities in 1998., 198649=2) In 1995, documentary evidence was provided by Iraq that 116 bombs filled with CS had been stored at a facility destroyed during the Gulf war., 610125=56. As the development of the Samoud missile system progressed, Iraq has engaged in more test activities, both static and flight. In order to properly evaluate these activities and test results, the Commission reverted to the practice of supplementing, on a temporary basis, resident teams with special equipment and personnel, including missile test engineers. This practice has proven to be very useful. Some 10 such supplementary groups have been sent to Iraq starting in late 1997. In the future, test engineers and specialists will have to be placed permanently on missile resident teams to cover effectively and in detail all missile test activities., 245762=38. The Commission\u0092s verification activities of the military aspects were the most sensitive elements of its investigation of Iraq\u0092s CW-programme. The Commission\u0092s attempts to clarify these issues created controversy on the Iraqi side. The document found by the Commission in July 1998 at the Head Quarters of the Iraqi Air force was an example of the documentation related to the military aspects. It detailed the expenditure of special munitions by the Air Force during the Iran-Iraq war. It was taken away by the Iraqi authorities from the Commission\u0092s inspection team in the course of the inspection and was not returned to the Commission., 67884=32. Evidence has been recovered pointing to Iraq\u0092s attempts to design and produce non-conventional warheads for missiles other than Al Hussein. Despite available documentary evidence of work on non-conventional warheads for so called FROG short-range missiles in 1990, Iraq insisted that all such work was done only in 1988 without any success or follow-up attempts. Iraq denied any activities related to non-conventional warheads for Volga/SA 2 surface-to-air missiles that it was modifying for surface-to-surface application., 119146=72. In addition to efforts to acquire propellants for Al Hussein class missiles and as a part of its efforts to develop a next generation of long-range missile systems with increased ranges, Iraq procured a more advanced missile fuel - hydrazine based UDMH. It also established a plan to construct a factory in Iraq for the production of 500 tonnes/year of UDMH. Iraq initially denied plans to design a missile engine using UDMH. In 1995, it admitted that it had had such plans and had actually carried out a static test of a SCUD-B engine modified for use with UDMH. Iraq declared that it had imported 10 tonnes of UDMH and ordered, but did not receive, more. Except for fuel used in the static test, the remaining quantity of imported UDMH had been declared by Iraq as unilaterally destroyed in 1991. No evidence or documentation were presented by Iraq to support this declaration., 477004=In August 1995 weaponization was acknowledged by Iraq including weapons trials and the prior deployment of weapons in January 1991., 470=LETTER DATED 27 JANUARY 1999 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES, 258850=Concealment and Deception Since its disclosures in 1995 Iraq has continued to deceive the Commission and conceal parts of its BW programme. This includes efforts to hide documents, media, equipment and operating locations., 554211=9. The Commission established a permanent and extensive facility in Baghdad as a base for its monitoring work. The Commission\u0092s earlier work had been conducted with a minimum of resident staff. With the advent of ongoing monitoring work, the necessity for a larger number of resident experts and administrative support was required. In 1994, Iraq provided a building for the use of the Commission and the IAEA. It was modified by the Commission to provide suitable arrangements and offices for monitoring work and a senior officer was appointed to head the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Centre (BMVC). This building is shared with other United Nations Agencies. It incorporates the Commission\u0092s communications equipment, chemical laboratory, monitoring camera system control room and administrative and logistical support for field operations., 165507=97. The Commission has obtained evidence that Iraq continued work on some key proscribed missile components after the adoption of resolutions 687 (1991) and 715 (1991). In particular, this involved such areas as gyroscope instruments for prohibited missile guidance and control systems, a technology Iraq had not fully succeeded in developing itself prior to the Gulf war. Most of these prohibited activities were declared by Iraq only in late 1995 or early 1996., 647314=20. Since October 1994, more than 50 governments have contributed personnel to the Chemical monitoring team at the BMVC. As a result, the Commission was able to recruit the most qualified and experienced personnel to serve as chief inspectors and deputy chief inspectors. These two positions require, top professional expertise and knowledge, management skills to supervise, organize and lead a group of international experts. Furthermore, it requires the ability to interact with the Iraqi counterparts., 584253=10. The second assumption was that the Government of Iraq would take a political decision to abide strictly by its undertaking not to initiate or engage in any proscribed activities and would enforce this decision throughout the territory of Iraq. If this was the case, then discrepancies that were always expected to be identified through monitoring, especially at its initial stages, would be interpreted as honest mistakes by individuals rather than as proscribed activities being deliberately concealed by the Government. The Plan for OMV provided that Iraq adopt legislation prohibiting all natural and legal persons under its jurisdiction from undertaking anywhere any activity prohibited by the relevant resolutions and the Plan, and to enact penal legislation to enforce the aforesaid prohibitions. Such legislation was required to have been enacted within thirty days of adoption by the Security Council of resolution 715 (1991) on 11 October 1991. To date, the legislation has not been enacted., 180325=116. A series of static tests under this project were conducted by Iraq in 1992 and 1993. The first five tests were not declared to the Commission and were thus not monitored by inspection teams. While the plan called for production of five sets of engine hardware, Iraq declared that a smaller number of parts and components had been actually produced but that no engine had ever been assembled. Some of these parts and components were later shown to an inspection team while others were declared to have been unilaterally melted. Little documentary evidence has been made available by Iraq to support its declarations regarding the nature of missile engine production activities at the Sadiq Factory., 250749=49. The Commission has a certain degree of confidence in the accounting for proscribed items declared by Iraq as having been destroyed during the 1991 Gulf war. The Commission has accepted through its verification the destruction of 34,000 special munitions and 823 tonnes of key precursors. Outstanding issues remain. These include the accounting for 2,000 unfilled and 550 filled special munitions., 115309=67. As a result of an expert meeting with Iraqi counterparts in July 1998, the international experts, who had been invited by the Commission, made an assessment that by the end of 1990, Iraq did not have the capability either to manufacture indigenously or assemble from foreign components, gyroscopes for its indigenous missiles., 344336=Drying of agent: It is not possible to determine if bacterial and toxin agents produced were dried to enhance storage stability or for reasons of dissemination. This issue is of significance because Iraq actively procured drying equipment and obtained training in the use of such equipment for key personnel. Drying studies on bacteria started in 1974., 160305=89. Iraq\u0092s failure to comply with its obligations can be traced, in a number of cases, to decisions made at the highest levels of the Government of Iraq. Some proscribed or undeclared activities, planned or ongoing, were known to the Governmental ministries and agencies but were allowed to start or continue. These findings are based on Iraq\u0092s own declarations, contemporaneous documents available to the Commission and official explanations by Iraq. Iraq maintains that most or all of such decisions were made not by the Government but by Lt. General Hussein Kamil Hassan Al-Majid. Prior to his defection from Iraq in August 1995, Lt. General Hussein Kamil held a variety of top positions in the Government such as Minister of Defence, Presidential Adviser, Director of Military Industrialization Commission, Minister-Supervisor, etc., 177613=112. The J-1 project was declared abandoned in May 1993. According to Iraq\u0092s declarations, prototypes of the J-1 missile were built and six flight tests were conducted in January - April 1993. Iraq provided several documents as well as imagery showing some of the test launches. Some components said to be produced under the J-1 programme were also shown to inspectors. The Commission has conducted document and computer searches at the relevant facilities to find additional supporting data \u0096 such as contemporaneous production records \u0096 to verify Iraq's declarations, albeit without success. Iraq stated that some of the hardware associated with the project had unilaterally been melted in foundries after the J-1 project had been stopped in May 1993., 280429=The Emergency Session of the Commission held in November 1997, concluded that the biological weapons file was the most serious area in which Iraq had consistently disregarded its obligations under SCR 687. The members of the Commission noted that the paucity of progress was largely attributable to Iraq\u0092s denial of the existence of any biological weapons programme until July 1995. The members of the Commission further noted that Iraq\u0092s FFCD of September 1997, was not substantially different from previous, unacceptable, versions, and it remained largely unsupported by evidence and documentation. The Security Council was urged to call upon Iraq to rectify the existing deficiencies., 275632=In 1995, when Iraq was confronted with evidence collected by the Commission of imports of bacterial growth media in quantities that had no civilian utility within Iraq\u0092s limited biotechnology industry, it eventually, on 1 July 1995, acknowledged that it used this growth media to produce two BW agents in bulk, botulinum toxin and Bacillus anthracis spores, between 1988 and 1991. It was not, until August of 1995, however, that Iraq acknowledged that it had weaponized BW agents, and had undertaken weapon tests from 1987 onwards. This admission only occurred after Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Hassan departed. Shortly afterwards, Iraq released a considerable quantity of documents concerned with its weapons of mass destruction programmes. The documents relating to biology represented just 200 documents with some pages out of a total of more than a million pages. Many of the biological documents were scientific reprints from foreign journals. Clearly, they represent only a minor portion of a BW programme that ran from 1973 until at least 1991., 164083=94. Iraq declared that, at the time of the adoption of resolution 687 (1991), it had also decided to retain components and assemblies of proscribed missiles but then unilaterally destroyed them in the second half of 1991. As reported above, Iraq stated that most of the items had been melted in secret., 321084=An aerosol generator for the dispersal of biological warfare agents or toxins was developed by the Technical Research Centre at Salman Pak by modification of helicopter-borne commercial chemical insecticide disseminators. These modified aerosol generators are assessed as suitable for the dissemination of BW agents from helicopters or slow moving fixed-wing aircraft and are referred to as Zubaidy devices. A description was included in the June 1996 FFCD. It did not however cite the number of devices produced nor account for their final disposition. In the current FFCD, the devices are only briefly mentioned. A document has also been submitted by Iraq reporting the successful field-testing of these devices in August 1988 to spray Bacillus subtilis spores. However it was stated at the Vienna biological TEM in March 1998, that Iraq now considers these devices to be inconsequential., 81488=51. In its first FFCD in May 1992, Iraq declared that all Project 1728 machines and equipment had been totally destroyed during the Gulf war. Following an intense effort to identify equipment procured for Project 1728, the Commission determined that Iraq\u0092s declared purpose for this programme was incorrect. The evidence obtained by the Commission indicated that the project had been established and operated specifically for the production of proscribed missiles, in particular their liquid propellant engines. Based on these findings, the Commission took the decision, in February 1995, on the disposal of Project 1728 equipment still available in Iraq at that time. Over a hundred machines and other major pieces of equipment were identified. Of these, the Commission requested the destruction of five machines, and established a prohibition on the use of eleven machines in any missile related production in Iraq. The remaining general purpose machines from Project 1728 were released since they could be used for non-proscribed activities and similar machines were readily available elsewhere in Iraq. Iraq protested the Commission\u0092s decision of February 1995. It agreed to implement it only in July 1995. In its November 1995 FFCD, Iraq finally acknowledged that the main purpose for Project 1728 had been the reverse-engineering and production of proscribed missile engines, and that the equipment, identified by the Commission, had been used or acquired for use in proscribed activities. A summary of the material balance of Project 1728 machines and equipment is contained in Table 7:, 254469=Iraq did not acknowledge its proscribed Biological Warfare (BW) weapons programme until July 1995. From the first UNSCOM inspections in 1991 until 1995 Iraq denied it had a BW programme and has taken active steps to conceal it from the Special Commission. These steps included fraudulent statements, forged documents, misrepresentation of the roles of people and facilities, and other specific acts of deception., 283162=For these discussions, the Commission proposed that the approach should be \"top down\", that is focus primarily on weapons, in the belief that the many other important issues in biology might be more easily resolved if progress were made with respect to weapons. Accordingly, the discussions focussed on the provision of new material in the key area of the material balance of weapons, especially material not covered in the March TEM. Iraq did not provide any new information and the FFCD, presented to the Commission in 1997, was judged again to be inadequate., 363061=As noted above, Iraq has recently stated that in 1991 some of the media was transferred from Al-Hakam to Kimadia. What is unclear and has not been explained to the Commission is the basis for the retention of media at Al-Hakam. Peptone, for example, which had been used for the production of Agent G had no apparent role at Al-Hakam in 1991 if the BW programme had been abandoned. Also Kimadia had \"covered\" for all the media remaining in 1991 and therefore any media remaining at Al-Hakam had been written off and was untraceable. It is not clear why this media was not accountable in the Iraqi system if indeed Al-Hakam had been converted to legitimate purposes in 1991., 406682=The activities undertaken in 1989 and 1990 - field testing aerial bombs, rockets and other munitions; the expansion of the programme in terms of research and agent production, and acquisition of additional facilities remain ill defined and as such a confident determination of the extent and scope of the programme cannot be made., 375619=1500 kg, 120070=73. In 1984, Iraq signed contracts for the importation of 115 surface-to-surface missiles called BADR 2000 and for the establishment in Iraq of the infrastructure for the production of the first stage solid propellant rocket motors for missiles of this class. The construction of the infrastructure, including a facility for the final integration and testing of the complete missile, started in 1985. Iraq declared that it had experienced difficulties with the supplier Government with regard to the provision of the missiles as well as support and production equipment. After contract delays and in an effort to receive some of the contracted items, Iraq signed another contract, in 1987, for the provision of only 17 complete BADR 2000 missiles and missile ground support equipment. Iraq declared that it soon realized that it would not receive any of the contracted missiles, nor most of the contracted infrastructure. Iraq terminated the contracts with this supplier Government in late 1988. Iraq declared that, in the beginning of 1989, it attempted to complete the BADR 2000 project by itself, in particular the production of solid propellant motors. This time it decided to deal directly with the supplier companies or their middlemen, as well as to rely on indigenous capabilities. Some additional materials, equipment and technologies were received by Iraq in 1989 and 1990. In late 1995 and early 1996, Iraq provided to the Commission substantial documentation, including contracts with suppliers, to support its declarations on the BADR 2000 project. The Commission has so far been unable to verify Iraq\u0092s declarations with the original supplier Government., 94773=54. In November 1995, Iraq provided inventory lists to account for the unilateral destruction of components in 1991. Iraq was unable to produce credible explanations of discrepancies between its official declarations and the data contained in the documents it provided. In 1996, Iraq admitted that most important components and tools for its missile engine production had been diverted from the declared unilateral destruction in 1991. Iraq stated that items thus concealed had been retained until March-May 1992, at which time they were secretly destroyed despite the fact that Iraq had already disclosed unilateral destruction of some other items from its proscribed missile activities. In July 1998, Iraq acknowledged that declarations provided to the Commission were not complete and that hiding of missile engine components prior to their unilateral destruction had occurred at an additional site undeclared until that time., 165978=98. After the adoption of resolution 687 (1991), Iraq continued to import components for gyroscope instruments until at least November 1991. These components had been ordered by Iraq prior to the Gulf war specifically for use in proscribed missiles. Iraq initially denied any dealing with the supplier of these components but, given the information obtained by the Commission, admitted extensive deals with the supplier. Iraq could not provide evidence to support its statements that, contrary to available evidence and documentation, only a single contract was signed with this supplier in May 1988 for the delivery of proscribed gyroscope instruments and their components had been in force., 473672=The past programme investigation consisted, essentially, of three phases. Firstly, the discovery inspections of 1991 and 1992, that showed that Iraq has not been forthcoming about the scale and scope of its programme. Second, from autumn 1994 to summer 1995, consisting of attempts to uncover the past weapons programme and to establish the credibility of statements being made by Iraq about its past programme and the claimed legitimate activities of sites assessed to have contributed to the programme. After the departure of Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Hassan in August 1995, the Commission embarked on a third phase of investigation of the programme using, in part, information derived from the documents released by Iraq from the Haidar Farm. During the first and second phases, Iraq concealed from the Commission, the entirety of its programme. Iraq merely acknowledged a part of its research programme as a military research and development programme and falsely presenting its main BW agent production facility as a Single Cell Protein plant. During this period Iraq actively and deliberately concealed much of the research programme and the entirety of the remainder of the programme. This it achieved by outright lying, evasiveness, intimidation, forging of documents, misrepresentation of sites and personnel, the denial of access to individuals and the issue of successive FFCDs that were fraudulent. The account provided by Iraq wholly lacked credibility., 58952=26. Pursuant to the programme of work established in July 1997, survey and excavation work started August 1997 at the declared sites of the unilateral destruction and the burial sites of warhead remnants. By June 1998, all sites declared by Iraq, where warhead remnants could be found, were surveyed and excavated. Thus, a strong presumption is that all remnants have been collected. Table 4 provides a summary of the assessment of recovered warheads remnants relevant to the material balance., 407183=Since the FFCD falsely states that the BW programme was obliterated in July 1991 no credible account is given of the preservation and concealment of the programme until 1995., 543097=22. Given that Iraq would not willingly discuss the matter, the Commission planned another series of inspections of sites belonging to the organizations considered to have direct involvement in concealment. Two inspections took place in June and July 1996. There were lengthy standoffs. U-2 imagery taken during standoffs in June identified vehicle and other movements at SSO and Special Republican Guard facilities adjacent to Presidential areas that the Commission assessed as being related to concealment. The Executive Chairman had discussions with the Deputy Prime Minister on access issues and agreed on 22 June 1996 on a Joint Programme of Action which included the topic of concealment as a priority for verification work., 611471=58. Seven compliance inspections have already been sent to Iraq since 1994 to verify information gained from inspections or received from other sources concerning Iraq\u0092s compliance with its obligations under the Plan for OMV not to use, develop, construct or acquire proscribed items. Most of them carried out investigations of Iraq\u0092s attempts, after the adoption of resolution 687 (1991), to procure from abroad items or assistance for its missile programmes. A number of cases were identified when Iraq imported or sought to import missile-related items that it was required to declare under the Plan for OMV. Some of these efforts were not declared to the Commission. In one particular case, the Commission established that Iraq imported proscribed gyroscopes in 1995 that could be used in long-range missiles., 157544=85. In its resolution 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991, the Security Council decided that Iraq should unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or rendering harmless, under international supervision, of all ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometres, and related major parts and repair and production facilities. The Council further decided that Iraq should unconditionally undertake not to use, develop, construct or acquire any prohibited items. By its resolution 715 (1991) of 11 October 1991, the Council approved the plans for monitoring and verification of Iraq\u0092s compliance with its obligations not to resume proscribed activities and demanded that Iraq meet unconditionally all its obligations under the plans., 26441=36. One hundred and ninety-seven pieces of glass CW production equipment were removed by Iraq from its prime CW facility prior to the Commission\u0092s arrival in 1991 and were repeatedly moved in shipping containers between several facilities throughout Baghdad until 1996. This production equipment from two of 20 shipping containers was destroyed under the Commission\u0092s supervision in 1997. To ensure that all CW production equipment removed from the CW facility has been accounted for, the Commission requested Iraq to provide its clarifications on their movement. Iraq presented such clarifications in July 1998. Field verification is still required to increase the degree of confidence that all equipment has been accounted for., 522000=The account of the history of the BW programme, given by Iraq, encompasses only a part of the programme, it is inaccurate with respect to dates, and fails to provide insight into the decision making process that facilitated its evolution. The account is misleading because it fails to present the underlying strategy and the long-term goals of the programme. Iraq's known concealment and deception activities cast doubts on its claim that the programme was obliterated in 1991., 420851=The resurgence of the BW programme is attributed to Gen. Nizar Attar, the State Organization for Technical Industries (SOTI) and MOD, and the appointment of Dr. Rihab Taha as an investigator in early 1985. This resulted in an initial programme of work at Al-Muthanna where Bacillus anthracis spores and Clostridium botulinum are acknowledged to be the cores of the activities. However, according to Iraq, under Gen. Nizar Attar\u0092s direction a plan was formulated in 1985 to develop biological weapons which included at least one additional agent, Clostridium perfringens. Iraq states, that basic studies on cultivation, identification, and pathogenicity of only Bacillus anthracis spores and Clostridium botulinum were undertaken. Nevertheless, there are indications that a broader survey of agents was undertaken as evidenced by the range of BW agents and simulants obtained in 1986 together with literature surveys undertaken by Iraq's scientists., 255053=Since its first revelations in July 1995, Iraq has submitted three \"Full, Final and Complete Disclosures\" (FFCDs) of its proscribed biological programme. The first of these, presented in August 1995, was declared null and void by Iraq itself. The second, submitted in June 1996, was subjected to intensive efforts to verify its accuracy and completeness through eight inspections and other technical discussions. In March 1997 an international panel of experts reviewed that FFCD and recommended its rejection because of the inadequacy of the material presented throughout the document., 422010=In mid 1987 a group of biology researchers left Al-Muthanna to continue to undertake research within TRC at Al-Salman and to support biological weapons tests. The full circumstance of this transfer has not been presented. In addition it is stated that formal research on Clostridium perfringens started in 1988; aflatoxin, trichothecene and ricin work started, with the recruitment of further experts; and offensive work with Tilletia spp. (Wheat cover smut or bunt of wheat) continued at an increased level of activity. Additional research studies on the dissemination of BW agents using both liquid and dried BW agents was undertaken although the full depths of this work remains to be presented by Iraq. The extent of these studies has not yet been determined but documentation indicates a greater understanding of dissemination than revealed to the Commission., 184679=4. Iraq\u0092s CW programme was initiated in the 1970s through R&D activities. Large-scale CW-related activities, including the construction of industrial CW production facilities, procurement and production of raw materials, CW components and production equipment, production and stockpiling of CW in quantities, were carried out, according to Iraq, in the period 1982-1990., 360123=The account in the FFCD of media consumed in the production of BW agent is acknowledged by Iraq to be a mathematical calculation based on a) the claimed quantity of agent produced and b) the estimate of failed production batches that would have also consumed media. In addition other quantities are said to have been discarded during the production process (Iraq has stated this to be due to spoilage). Other than the 1990 Al-Hakam report outlining agent production at Al-Hakam for that year, Iraq has provided no records or other documentation to support its estimates.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The table provides a summary of Iraq\u0092s declarations concerning R-400 aerial bombs. \u00a0 The frequent changes in the Iraqi account of the Al-Hussein missile warheads and the R-400 aerial bombs are more than adjustments of detail. They cast doubt on the entire Iraqi declaration on weaponization. \u00a0 The account of Iraq\u0092s R-400 aerial bombs has been changed several times since 1991. Even in July 1998 Iraq has made \u0091suggestions\u0092 changing the numbers of bombs filled with particular BW agents. The inconsistency between the FFCD account and the physical evidence means that the Iraqi account cannot be confirmed. Thus, the FFCD account is not verified. \u00a0 A review by international experts of all information available to the Commission demonstrated that the account of R-400 bombs in the 1997 biological FFCD is both incomplete and inaccurate. The FFCD provides no documented account of filling. This means that a material balance for the weapons and the BW agents incorporated within them cannot be established. There is no confident upper limit on the number of bombs filled for BW purposes. There is no authenticated account of the destruction of the BW agent contained in the weapons. The possibility that such weapons remain in Iraq, cannot be precluded or that agent produced for",
    "textAfterTable": "Filled with Bacillus anthracis spores 50 The account is not supported by documents. No evidence of Bacillus anthracis spores has been found among the remnants recovered at the destruction site. Iraq states that 50 R-400A but no R-400 bombs were filled with Bacillus anthracis spores. A senior Iraqi official in July 1998 suggested that probably fewer than 50 contained Bacillus anthracis spores. According to Iraq, the numbers filled are only estimates. Filled with aflatoxin 7 Iraq has not provided any documents to support the filling of R-400s with aflatoxin. No evidence of aflatoxin has been found among the remnants recovered at the destruction site. Iraq initially stated that 16 uncoated R-400 but no R-400A bombs were filled with aflatoxin. Later the number was reduced to seven to correspond to the decrease in total numbers of bombs filled. According to Iraq, numbers filled are only estimates. Other 0 There is no complete account of the agents to fill R-400 weapons. An analysis of all the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that another BW agent was filled into some weapons, either in addition to those declared, or substituting one already declared. The inconsistencies in markings indicating agent type on the R-400 bombs coupled with the lack of evidence on filling, the presence at Al-Walid Airbase of two",
