The CPSC proposes to replace the testing procedures for glazing materials in certain architectural products, set forth in 16 CFR 1201.4, with the testing procedures contained in the voluntary standard, ANSI Z97.1-2009 \u03b5 2, American National Standard for Safety Glazing Materials Used in Buildings\u2014Safety Performance Specifications and Methods of Test., 78083=Title 16 published on 2015-01-01, 176518=The Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) in the Federal Register on December 30, 2014, proposing to prohibit children's toys and child care articles containing specified phthalates. The NPR invited the public to submit comments; the comment period as set in the NPR ends March 16, 2015. The Commission is extending the comment period until April 15, 2015., 44191=The Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act (CGBPA or the Act) adopted the child-resistance requirements for closures on portable gasoline containers\u2014found in the 2005 version of the applicable ASTM rule, F2517-05\u2014as a consumer product safety rule. The 2005 ASTM standard was recently revised. Under the Act, the consumer product standard for portable gasoline containers will, by operation of law, incorporate the 2015 revisions to the child-resistance requirements unless the Commission finds that the revisions do not carry out the purposes of the CGBPA's requirements. The Commission has not found that the revisions fail to carry out the purposes of the CGBPA's requirements. As a result, the 2015 revisions to the child-resistance requirements will be automatically incorporated and apply as the statutorily-mandated standard for closures on portable gasoline containers. This direct final rule is to codify certain sections of the 2015 standard to eliminate potential confusion as to the applicable standard., 142410=The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) has received a petition requesting amendments to the test procedure in the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles, 16 CFR part 1610.

In response to a December 31, 2014, request, the Commission is extending the comment period announced in the November 2014 SNPRM from January 30, 2015, to March 17, 2015., 190665=The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) is proposing a rule to specify that extension cords (both indoor and outdoor use extension cords) that do not contain one or more readily observable characteristics set forth in the proposed rule constitute a substantial product hazard under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA). The rule would amend 16 CFR part 1120, which lists products that the Commission has determined present a substantial product hazard if the products have or lack specified characteristics that are readily observable, have been addressed by a voluntary standard, such standard has been effective in reducing the risk of injury associated with the product, and there is substantial compliance with the standard., 146791=The Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) in the Federal Register on November 19, 2014, concerning recreational off-highway vehicles (ROVs). The NPR invited the public to submit written comments by February 2, 2015. In response to two requests for an extension, the Commission extended the comment period to April 8, 2015.

These standards are to be \u201csubstantially the same as\u201d applicable voluntary standards or more stringent than the voluntary standards if the Commission determines that more stringent requirements would further reduce the risk of injury associated with the products. The Commission is issuing a safety standard for frame child carriers in response to the direction under section 104(b) of the CPSIA. In addition, the Commission is amending its regulations regarding third party conformity assessment bodies to include the mandatory standard for frame child carriers in the list of Notices of Requirements (NOR) issued by the Commission., 111204=The Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act, section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (\u201cCPSIA\u201d), requires the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d or \u201cCPSC\u201d) to promulgate consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products. These standards are to be \u201csubstantially the same as\u201d applicable voluntary standards or more stringent than the voluntary standard if the Commission concludes that more stringent requirements would further reduce the risk of injury associated with the product. The Commission is proposing a safety standard for portable hook-on chairs (\u201chook-on chairs\u201d) in response to the direction under section 104(b) of the CPSIA. In addition, the Commission is proposing an amendment to include an additional CFR part in the list of notice of requirements (\u201cNORs\u201d) issued by the Commission., 40069=The Federal Trade Commission published final rules on March 23, 2015, revising certain of its rules of practice.
