            "Description",
            "Method of Transferring Thin Films - The present invention discloses a method for transferring a thin film from a first substrate to a second substrate comprising the steps of: providing a transfer structure and a thin film provided on a surface of a first substrate, the transfer structure comprising a support layer and a film contact layer, wherein the transfer structure contacts the thin film; removing the first substrate to obtain the transfer structure with the thin film in contact with the film contact layer; contacting the transfer structure obtained with a surface of a second substrate; and removing the film contact layer, thereby transferring the thin film onto the surface of the second substrate.",
            "PASSIVATION AND WARPAGE CORRECTION BY NITRIDE FILM FOR MOLDED WAFERS - Embodiments of the invention generally relate to molded wafers having reduced warpage, bowing, and outgassing, and methods for forming the same. The molded wafers include a support layer of silicon nitride disposed on a surface thereof to facilitate rigidity and reduced outgassing. The silicon nitride layer may be formed on the molded wafer, for example, by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition or hot-wire chemical vapor deposition.",
            "VARIABLE FREQUENCY MICROWAVE (VFM) PROCESSES AND APPLICATIONS IN SEMICONDUCTOR THIN FILM FABRICATIONS - Methods and apparatus for processing a substrate are described herein. A vacuum multi-chamber deposition tool can include a degas chamber with both a heating mechanism and a variable frequency microwave source. The methods described herein use variable frequency microwave radiation to increased quality and speed of the degas process without damaging the various components."

The method includes acquiring seed content and using the seed content in the creation or updating of a content list. Additional content for the channel is acquired based on the common features of the content list. 20140337731 09-25-2014 TV SEARCH - A device consistent with certain embodiments has a television receiver and an Internet Protocol television (IPTV) receiver. A decoder decodes television programming from either of the television receiver or the IPTV receiver. A programmed processor(s) retrieves metadata relating to television programming, IPTV content, any installed Widgets, and the television (TV) receiver device's function, all of which are considered search targets. The programmed processor stores tags from the metadata in a database and associates the tags with their targets. A search engine searches the database for tags in response to a search query and to retrieve the associated target on command. The control processor executes the target by either tuning to the target's program content or by launching or resuming a Widget or TV device function.

    "textAfterTable": "Lye Seng Wong, Singapore SG Patent application number Description Published 20130338941 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DEFECT DETECTION IN COMPOSITE STRUCTURES - Methods and apparatus for non-destructive testing of a composite structure utilizing sonic or ultrasonic waves. In response to a wideband chirp wave sonic excitation signal transmitted from a probe to the composite structure, a probe signal received is correlated with a library of predetermined probe signals and a graphical representation of defects detected is generated. The graphical representation provides detailed information on defect type, defect location and defect shape. Also contemplated is a probe for non-destructive testing of a composite structure comprising three or more transducers wherein each transducer is separately configurable as a transmitter or as a receiver; and a controller coupled to each of transducer for providing signals thereto and receiving signals therefrom, wherein the signals provided thereto include signals for configuring each transducer as either a transmitter or a receiver, and signals for providing an excitation signal from each transducer which is configured as a transmitter. 12-19-2013 Melvin Wong, Singapore SG Patent application number Description Published 20120102715 SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONNECTING AN AUTOMATION CONTROLLER AND A PROGRAMMABLE MODULE - An interlocking system for connecting a programmable module and an automation controller of an industrial control and automation system is provided.
