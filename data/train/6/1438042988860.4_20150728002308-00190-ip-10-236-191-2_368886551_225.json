    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{5961=All acoustic reflex tests were performed by a trained examiner on examinees in a dedicated, sound-isolating room in the mobile examination center (MEC). Acoustic reflex testing is performed by putting a small probe into the ear that presents standardized sound stimului at 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz. The resulting changes in the compliance of the ear drum are then measured over a period of 1.5 seconds. Please see the NHANES Audiometry/Tympanometry Procedures Manual for further information on Acoustic Reflex testing., 3300=The data points represent equivalent volume (compliance) data in daPa during the \u00bd second (500 msec) period of stimulation and in the one second period post-simulation. As with the tympanometry raw data, the responses for each individual ear are contained in a series of 84 equally spaced sequential measurement variables, in this case the intervals between variables representing sequential time units. The average time between each numbered variable is 1500 msec/84 or 17.9 msec., 6361=NHANES 2009-10 acoustic reflex testing was performed on a full sample of U.S. adolescents ages 12\u201319 years of age and U.S. adults ages 70+ years. Subjects using hearing aids who were not able to remove them for testing and subjects who had sufficient ear pain at the time of the exam were excluded., 3761=The acoustic reflex data files (AUXAR_F) represent the raw data as it was collected. They contain a total of 336 variables, 168 representing the right and left ear acoustic reflex curve data at 1000 Hz (the variables AUXRR101 to AUXRR184; and AUXLR101 to AUXLR184, respectively) and 168 variables representing the right and left ear acoustic reflex curve data at 2000 Hz (the variables AUXRR201 to AUXRR284; and AUXLR201 to AUXLR284, respectively)., 8036=Title: Audiometry - Acoustic Reflex (AUXAR_F ) Contact Number: 1-866-441-NCHS Years of Content: 2009 - 2010 First Published: June, 2012 Revised: August, 2012 Access Constraints: None Use Constraints: None Geographic Coverage: National Subject:Audiometry, Hearing testing, Acoustic Reflexes, Survey, United States Record Source: NHANES 2009 - 2010 Survey Methodology: NHANES 2009 - 2010 is a stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the U.S. Medium: NHANES Web site; SAS transport files, 7235=In addition to pure tone audiometry (AUX_F) and tympanometry (AUXTYM_F), the NHANES 2009-2010 Audiometry Examination Component included examination data to measure the acoustic reflexes. The acoustic reflex is a protective, automatic reflex contraction of the ear drum in response to a sudden, high-intensity sound stimulus. The acoustic reflex may be of diagnostic value as it is diminished or absent in persons with specific types of hearing loss. Acoustic reflex testing is performed by putting a small probe into the ear that presents a standardized sound stimulus. The resulting changes in the compliance of the ear drum are then measured over a period of 1.5 seconds. If the normal acoustic reflex is diminished or absent, it can be an indication of nerve damage to the middle ear., 2486=The acoustic reflex examination for 2009-10 was administered to a full sample of participants in the NHANES Mobile Examination Center (MEC). Therefore, the NHANES MEC examination weights should be used for data analysis. For more information on the use of sample weights in current NHANES data analysis and for combining weighted data across multiple NHANES survey years please refer to the NHANES Analytic Guidelines http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/survey_methods.htm) and the on-line NHANES Tutorial (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.}",
