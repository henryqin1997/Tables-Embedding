In the life time of Charles there were many new immigrants arriving in Virginia from England. They came in boatloads almost every month in the year. More and more settlements were established. By 1700 there were more than 80,000 persons living in the tidewater region of Virginia. During this time the colony was in almost constant trouble with their ruler, the English government and its representatives. Mainly the colonists objected to the arbitrary action of the colony officials and their ruthless demands. As new immigrants arrived, the frontier was pushed further westward until the settlements reached the mountains. As the people moved farther away from the royal governors, they gained more and more privileges and grew more independent. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conversely, as people moved deeper into the wilderness, they came to rely more on their family and neighbors. The Dodsons were allied with two families more than any other at this point in time: the Goads and the Smythes, and their families intermarried and grew extremely tight for several generations.\u00b2 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charles died on 6 Feb, 1705 in North Farnham Parish, Richmond County, Virginia. After his death, Ann married a man named John Hill, sometime before 3 July 1706, on which day they petitioned the court for an appraisement of Charles' estate (Richmond Co. Order Bk 4, Page 171). Her son, Thomas Dodson, then brought an action in court \"against John Hill marrying the Executrix of Charles Dodson.\" The action was dismissed by the court on 3 April 1707, \"the plaintiff not prosecuting' (Richmond Co., Order Bk 4, page 262). The reason for this court action was not explained, but the wishes of Charles' will, transcribed below, were obeyed:, 13218=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Pittsylvania County was created in 1766, some Dodsons fell into the area of the new county, others remained in the section that was still Halifax. Records for both counties in the ensuing decades record a considerable number of Dodsons. Generally speaking, the Dodson families lived in the southern half of the county. Lazarus, George and Thomas were on the same list, and Thomas was tithed with eight slaves. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, their brother LAMBETH DODSON, JR., was on a separate list. He and his wife, ELIZABETH, lived between the Patrick and Henry Counties on the North Carolina state line in the early-to-mid 1700's. Lambeth Jr. patented land in Guilford Co NC in 1779, some of which was sold by Lambeth Dodson of Henry Co VA to Zachariah King in 1784; another part of this land was sold by Dodson heirs in 1814. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Surry Co. tax list for 1775 are about two thirds complete. there are no Dodsons on Charles McAnally's very incomplete list; Reuban Dodson is on Camplin's list and George Dodson is on Benjamin Clevelands's list. Charles Dodson was not listed in 1775. There are no Surry County tax lists for 1776. In 1777, Charles Dodson re-appears on the tax lists in Jabez Jervis' District. (This district covered an area presently in Wilkes County.) No other Dodson's are on the 1777 tax lists for Surry, which are estimated to be about one-third complete, so others may actually have been living there. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lambeth Jr. married ELIZABETH, and they had:, 23807=Richmond County, Virginia Will Book 2, pages 95 and 96 (3 pages) In the name of God amen \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I Charles Dodson* being sick and weake of body but in Sound and Good disposing memory praise be given to God for the same do make this my Last Will and Testam... manner and forme following that is to say first & principally I resigne my soul into the merciful hands of almighty God my Creator assuredly hoping through the merritts of my blessed Saviour to obtaine Remission of all my sins and my body I Committ to the Earth whence it was taken to be Decently buryed by the Discretion of my Executrix herein after named and as for the worldly Goods and Estate the Lord hath Lent me I dispose thereof as followeth \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I Give and bequeath to my son Charles Dodson the plantation formerly called Coll??

[Richmond Co VA Miscellaneous Record Book, p. 41]). He lived in an area about 60 miles northeast of what is now the city of Richmond, near the Rappahannock River. Many Dotson family histories actually begin their genealogies with Charles, as he's the first proven ancestor in this family. As there is no record of his birth to Jesse, nor is there any documentation of a Charles Dodson arriving in Virginia by ship, so he fits neatly into either family history scenario. (One database in Salt Lake City shows that Charles Dodson, Sr. was the son of Jesse who came from England, with Judith Hagger. Another lists the same mother, but the father's name is Thomas Dodson, b. 1620 in Wakefield, Yorkshire, England. Take your pick.) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that the Colony was growing so fast that it was practically impossible to keep faithful records. New immigrants arrived in Virginia in boatloads, almost every month in the year. By the year 1700, there were more than 80,000 persons living in the tidewater region of Virginia, when there had been only a handful in the day of John Dods. Between the influx of new immigrants, and official records stored in Richmond, being destroyed by fire, much of the genealogical work has to be left to family histories and church records. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until 1686, the Episcopal Church was the State church in Virginia. All children, regardless of religious affiliation, were required to be baptized by the minister of the church, like the parish that the Dodsons lived near in North Farnham.\u00b9 Dates of birth and names of their parents were recorded in parish registers. The same information was taken of marriages and burials. The church records are preserved, and are available in the Virginia State Library in Richmond, Virginia. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These records to not reveal the origins of Charles. But the fact of the matter is that Charles himself makes an impressive start to any genealogy. He was by all reports a successful, industrious, remarkably well-respected frontiersman. Fortunately, the records do show that between 1678 and 1680, Charles married a woman named ANN (last name unknown, but it was probably either ELMORE or DOTSON, b: 1654) in Rappahannock County. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charles prospered in Rappahannock, which became extinct in 1692, being divided into Essex and Richmond counties. Charles owned land in both counties, but actually resided in North Farnham Parish, Richmond County, Virginia.\u00b9 He was a highly trusted neighbor, and witnessed many deeds and wills. An excellent example of ther esteem held for Charles is in the will of John Lincoln, dictated on Dec. 18, 1686, in which an affidavit reports that Lincoln \"would have no other but Charles Dodson as his executor although several insisted that he have his wife.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charles and Ann had the following children:}",

They apparently rent the land, as no value is given to their farm property. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The census taker lists George as being able to read and write, while Nancy can only read. Meanwhile, their son, eight year-old HARRISON, is attending school. Other children listed at home are Arena (age 4), Kizziah (age 3) and John B. (age 1). One more child would be added in 1875, George W., Jr. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Altogether, George and Nancy had the following children:, 84258=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jordan applied for homestead land on Big Branch, on January 25, 1851, and received 100 acres. They worked a farm near Peters Pond, and their family became closely allied with branches of the Stump, Coleman, and Hatfield families (our line later married into the McCoy family, meaning we had lots of family actively involved on both sides of the famous Hatfield/McCoy feud). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By 1860, Kentucky had an overall population of approximately 1,150,000, of whom about 226,000 were slaves and about 10,000 were free blacks. The state stood third in total population among the slave states. Kentucky was poor, and no planter owned over 300 slaves, only 7 owned over 100, and only 70 owned more than 50. However, on the other hand, with the exception of Virginia, Kentucky had more slaveholders owning from one to seven slaves than any other slave state. Jordan and Polly probably had no slaves, and they barely scraped togther a living on their farm. Both were illiterate, which was very common for the time and area. They had the following children:, 25832=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charles sired at least three sons: REUBEN DOTSON, whom was born sometime around the year 1775, Charles and James. We know next to nothing about the last two sons, and even less about their mother (many North Carolina records from this period have been lost, so it's doubtful that we'll ever know anything)., 182293=\u00b2\u0097Abraham Goad in his 1734 will in Richmond County named two daughters married to Dodsons, Elizabeth born 1795, was married to John Dodson, and Alice was the wife of Fortunatus Dodson, son of Charles, Jr. On 9 Feb 1699 - Will of William Smyth, husband of Eve witnessed by Mary \u201cDoson\u201d. Goads are heirs. On 24 April 1704 the Will of Eve Smith (Smyth), mother of Katherine (Williams) Goad was witnessed by William, Charles and Anne Dodson, and proved 4 Oct 1705 by Charles and Anne.

He and brother William Dodson then both served in the Virginia Militia, in Harmon Critz' Company from Henry County. In the summer of 1780, the company marched against the Tories and pursued them as far as the Yadkin River. On March 11, 1781 the company was ordered to assist General Greene in North Carolina, and fought at the battle of King\u2019s Mountain.
