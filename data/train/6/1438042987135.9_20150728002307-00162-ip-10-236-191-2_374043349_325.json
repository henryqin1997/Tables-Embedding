For example, if the interface IP MTU size is 1500 bytes, OSPF uses packet size of 1500 bytes on the interface because the byte size is lower than 9000 bytes. If the interface IP MTU size is 9500 bytes, OSPF uses packet size of 9000 bytes on the interface because the byte size exceeds 9000 bytes. The interface IP MTU size depends on the interface and the platform. In most cases, the default interface IP MTU value will be lower than 9000 bytes., 41634=The following example shows how to set the reference value for the auto cost calculation to 1000 Mbps:, 1061280=The following example shows how to configure an LSA refresh interval of 1800 seconds:, 1082943=The following example shows how to change the start, hold, and maximum wait interval values to 5, 1000, and 90000\u00a0milliseconds, respectively:, 6631=To modify or remove the area, the area-id argument format must be the same as the format used when creating the area.
