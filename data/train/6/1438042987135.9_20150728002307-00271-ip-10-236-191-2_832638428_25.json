    "textBeforeTable": "Note: Elements with the role alert have an implicit aria-live value of assertive, and an implicit aria-atomic value of true. Alerts are assertive live regions and will be processed as such by assistive technologies. Neither authors nor user agents are required to set or manage focus to them in order for them to be processed. Since alerts are not required to receive focus, content authors SHOULD NOT require users to close an alert. If the operating system allows, the user agent SHOULD fire a system alert event through the accessibility API when the WAI-ARIA alert is created. If an alert requires focus to close the alert, then content authors SHOULD use alertdialog instead. Alerts are used to convey messages to alert the user. In the case of audio warnings this is an accessible alternative for a hearing-impaired user. The alert role goes on the node containing the alert message. Alerts are specialized forms of the status role, which will be processed as an atomic live region. A message with important, and usually time-sensitive, information. See related alertdialog and status. # alert (role) A browser or application window. window (abstract role) An interactive component of a graphical user interface (GUI).",

Alert dialogs are used to convey messages to alert the user. The alertdialog role goes on the node containing both the alert message and the rest of the dialog. Content authors SHOULD make alert dialogs modal by ensuring that, while the alertdialog is shown, keyboard and mouse interactions only operate within the dialog. Unlike alert, alertdialog can receive a response from the user. For example, to confirm that the user understands the alert being generated. When the alert dialog is displayed, authors SHOULD set focus to an active element within the alert dialog, such as a form edit field or an OK button. The user agent SHOULD fire a system alert event through the accessibility API when the alert is created, provided one is specified by the intended accessibility API. Authors SHOULD use aria-describedby on an alertdialog to point to the alert message element in the dialog. If they do not, assistive technologies will resort to their internal recovery mechanism to determine the contents of an alert message. Characteristics of alertdialog Characteristic Value",
