We hold Songfest every October, and it is huge on campus. Every dorm creates their own skit and preforms. Almost everyone on campus participates or comes to watch. It's so much fun, and it really brings everyone together. The third floor of the library is kind of hidden. I didn't know about it until my second semester. It's a great place to study, since no one every goes up there., 99077=The dorms are very uncomfortable and are 100 years old.
