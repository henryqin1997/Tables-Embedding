            "Description",
            "DEVICE FOR SUBMERGING MATERIAL INTO LIQUID METAL BY AN ELECTROMAGNETIC STIRRER - A furnace plant including at least one furnace vessel comprising side walls, a bottom and a roof. At least one heater is configured to heat metal in the furnace vessel. A compartment includes sidewalls lined with refractory material. The compartment forms an extension of the furnace vessel. At least one electromagnetic stirrer is arranged outside and adjacent to the compartment. A refractory plate is arranged inside the compartment. The refractory plate includes an upper edge configured to be positioned below a meniscus of molten metal and includes a lower edge positioned spaced apart from a bottom of the compartment. The plate is arranged such that a gap between the plate and a wall of the compartment increases toward the bottom of the compartment.",
            "Apparatus And Method For Electromagnetic Stirring In An Electrical Arc Furnace - An apparatus for electromagnetic stirring of the steel melt in an electrical arc furnace includes two electromagnetic stirrer units, a current supply, and a control unit. The two stirrers are mounted on an outer bottom surface of the electrical arc furnace at opposites sides of a central position of the bottom surface, the current supply is operatively connected to the two electromagnetic stirrer units, and the control unit is operatively connected to the current supply to control the operation of the two electromagnetic stirrer units.",
            "Method And Arrangement For Vortex Reduction In A Metal Making Process - A method for reducing vortex formation in molten metal when bottom tapping the molten metal from a metallurgical vessel in a metal making process. The method includes the steps of tapping the molten metal via a tapping hole in the metallurgical vessel, and providing a flow of the molten metal in the metallurgical vessel while tapping via a time-varying electromagnetic field applied to the metallurgical vessel, the flow of the molten metal being such that it constantly moves vortices in the molten metal away from a tapping hole region during the tapping to thereby prevent accumulation of the vortices for vortex formation over the tapping hole. It is also presented an arrangement for carrying out the method."

A software profiling system may be configured to receive code for an application that executes in a first computing environment and analyze the code to determine efforts associated with migrating the application to execute in one or more second computing environments. For instance, the software profiling system may be configured to determine the migration efforts for migrating a software application that operates in a non-cloud computing environment to a cloud computing environment. The software profiling system may generate transformation points that serve as estimation units for solving anomalies identified to bring various aspects of the application into conformance with one or more of the second computing environments. The transformation points may be used to determine an overall migration effort for migrating the application to one or more of the second computing environments. 20140282456 Published Description Patent application number Thomas J. Kroon, Franklin, MA US 12-24-2009 System And Method For Defective Inkjet Correction Using Edge Information In An Image - A method for image correction compensates for a defective inkjet in a printhead by distributing compensation values to other image data locations in an image data memory. The method includes searching image data stored in an image data array to detect one",
