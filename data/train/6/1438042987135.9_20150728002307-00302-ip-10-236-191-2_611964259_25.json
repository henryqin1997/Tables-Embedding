            "Lidar data were collected by Airborne 1 under subcontract to URS by FEMA. Data were checked for quality by Dewberry and Davis.",
            "Lidar data were processed by Coastal Services Center for incorporation into the Digital Coast. Coordinates were converted to geographic latitude and longitude using the General Cartographic Transform Program algorithms. Elevations were converted from orthometric heights to heights on the NAD83 ellipsoid using the NGS GEOID03 model. Height units were converted to meters from feet. The data were converted to LAZ format.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
