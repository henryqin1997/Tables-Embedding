He took matters in his own hands by scoring on a 46-yard run with 3:55 remaining in the fourth quarter, giving Miami (5-5) a 10-point lead., 46761=The Dolphins, who started 0-3, came into Thursday night two games behind New England for first place in the AFC East. Miami lost to the Patriots November 8, but has two division games remaining, November 29 at Buffalo and the following week at home against the Patriots., 47394=Henne threw to Ricky Williams over the middle for a 14-yard touchdown on a 3rd-and-9 play. The score, which came with just under four minutes left in the half, completed a nine-play, 81-yard march. Miami converted a 3rd-and-16 during the drive with an 18-yard run by Hilliard., 48649=Smith's leaping reception in the end zone for a 27-yard score and DeAngelo Williams' run up the middle for the two-point conversion pulled the Panthers within 17-14 with 5:18 remaining.}",
