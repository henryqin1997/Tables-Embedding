After a San Diego punt, the Titans gained possession at their own 42 with 2:38 to play with a chance to tie., 76944=San Diego got back on the board with Mathews' seven-yard scamper into the end zone to cap a five-play, 72-yard series in just 2:48. Consecutive completions by Rivers for 25 and 33 yards, respectively, helped the Chargers move down the field quickly to score on the first play after the two-minute warning., 74797=San Diego had a response with an eight-play, 52-yard drive that ended when Darren Sproles caught a short pass from Rivers and raced 13 yards for a touchdown with 6:51 to play. Sproles had returned the kickoff 27 yards to the 33, and a 15-yard penalty put the Chargers in prime field position., 77415=The Titans appeared to have an interception return for a touchdown on the Chargers' next series, but Michael Griffin was ruled to have held Gates on a pass play deep in San Diego territory. The next play saw Tolbert run for 36 yards to the Tennessee 48, and Gates found the end zone on the next snap on a wide-open catch down the left sideline with 4:20 left in the third, giving the Chargers a 24-19 lead.}",
