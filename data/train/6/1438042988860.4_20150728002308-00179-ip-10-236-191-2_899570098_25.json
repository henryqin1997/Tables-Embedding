It's not bad for about $32000 a year, and it seems like you get your money worth., 62160=I learned a lot from the classes that I did this fall semester 2011 and I hope it continue for the four years that I will be here., 141278=An unusual tradition Plymouth has is the pumpkin that is placed on the top of Rounds Hall every Halloween.

Along with academics there are plenty of clubs and sports teams you can join. It's just a great school in general. You'll love it here! Tips for prospective students Turn in you assignments on time. Get some sleep. Don't procrastinate. Don't be afraid to make some friends. Don't know how? Take your books or your laptop and study in the common area of your residence hall. Everyone studies out there. You're bound to make a friend or two. Bang for the buck This school is definitely worth it, but it's not exactly cheap. If I didn't love it, I wouldn't be here. Am",
