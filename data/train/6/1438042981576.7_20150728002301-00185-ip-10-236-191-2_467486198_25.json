The amounts formulated an shown in % by weight. The results are shown in Table 2. (Monitor Test) (2) Test Example: 2 The results are shown in FIG. 1. The amount of PIP increased according to the concentration of the extract from the shoot of the Fagus crenate. At 0.1%, a significant increase was observed. As explained above, the extract of the shoot of the Fagus crenate was observed to have the effect of promoting the type I collagen biosynthesis ability without affecting the proliferation of cells al extremely low concentrations of 0.01 to 0.1%. The amount of cells was estimated by the amount of DNA of the cells. The amount of DNA was measured using a Hoechst 33258 reagent according to the method of Cesar Labarca et al. (Analytical Biochemistry, 102, 344-352 (1980)). The type I collagen biosynthesis ability of the cells was evaluated by measuring the amount of Procollagen type IC-peptide (PIP) secreted into the culture supernatent. Specifically, this was measured using a \u201cProcollagen type IC-peptide (PIP) measurement kit (made by",

They were asked to us the cosmetics on the skin of their faces daily for one month then aloe effect of improvements in the tautness and sagging of the skin and the effect of improvement of wrinkles and crow's feet were investigated. Effect of Improvement of Tautness of Skin The state of the skin was observed visually and evaluates based on the following evaluation criteria.
