    "textAfterTable": "Additional Information: 1) ACT carefully selects the right amount of cushioning between the linings to allow for good engagement characteristics without sacrificing performance. 2) Most ACT spring centered assemblies use bushings and cone springs similar to factory clutch discs. This creates frictional dampening which improves clutch life and reduces noise. 3) Spring retainers by ACT utilize a wrap around spring window that not only gives liberal support for the springs, but also reduces stress concentrations that are a common cause for failure. (Offered on most ACT Modified and Performance Street Discs). 4) ACT performance linings are steel backed for maximum burst and rotational strength. 5) They carefully broach splines to ensure exact fit onto transmission input shaft for long spline life and better clutch release. 6) Heavy duty torsional dampening springs are stronger in most cases than standard springs and are provided in the best sizes and spring rates to suit the application. 7) ACT Performance Street Discs feature a high copper content friction material. Through the use of copper the heat is pulled away from the surface. ACT achieves better heat tolerance and faster recovery from overheating. 8) Top grade rivets are used to securely fasten the part together. Rivet design and rivet materials are carefully selected for maximum strength. 9) Spring windows on most ACT street discs are heat",
