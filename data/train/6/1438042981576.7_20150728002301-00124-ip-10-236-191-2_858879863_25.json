'Early Cu\u00eazi' can be taken as before the Golden Age (that is, before 104), and 'Late Cu\u00eazi' as after the Silver Age (after 601). Perhaps more striking than the regional variation is the chronological, inasmuch as the corpus of written Cu\u00eazi extends over 1700 years. Some changes are noted in the discussion below; other changes of particular interest are the appearance of r and l in some words in very early manuscripts (e.g. abr\u0113na, c\u0101lco), now understood as a retention from proto-Eastern; and the twin tendencies in late Cu\u00eazi to multiply auxiliaries, and to place them in second position in the sentence, rather than at the end of the sentence. Characteristic of the southern dialects are \u017e for Central y (ru\u017eisi 'red'), ht- for ut- (ht\u0101ne 'come'), and w for v (ewissas 'knower'). Similar giveaways of Northern dialect include the fall of intervocalic voiced consonants (xowe 'barley'), and the raising of Cu\u00eazi's frequent ae diphthongs to /aj/, as in mayca 'nobody'. Cuzei being largely rural, and the non-Eleitan dialects having no approved literary expression, speech varied from town to town, or even from House to House. The speech of the nobles and upper servants, who spent more time in Eleisa,",
    "textAfterTable": "r is an approximant, not tapped or trilled, but not retroflexed like the Midwestern American r. Cu\u00eazi has a seven-vowel system /i e e a o u/, as in Italian. The orthographic representations i a u are straightforward. Closed /e/ is represented as e word-finally, ei elsewhere; open /e/ is always spelled e, since it does not occur word-finally. Thus Eleisa /elesa/. Likewise /o/ is represented as o word-finally, ou elsewhere; // is spelled o, and does not occur word-finally. Each of these vowels can be pronounced long: \u0101, \u0113, \u0113i, \u012b, \u014d, \u014du, \u016b. There is no difference in quality between short and long vowels-- only length. The semivowels [w] and [j] are arguably allophones of /u/ and /i/ rather than separate phonemes. A short u or i becomes a semivowel word-initially (uelo [welo]) or between vowels (ruyisi); note that i is spelled y in these cases, but u does not change. Adjacent to another vowel, u and i generally form diphthongs (but without orthographic change): maime [majme]; bard\u0101u [barda:w]. A literal pronunciation (e.g. [maime]) is always allowed, however; it's used in poetry and is common in the southern dialects. Cu\u00eazi is a tonal language: the long vowels are pronounced with a medium-high even tone, the circumflexed vowels \u00e2, \u00ea, \u00ee, \u00f4, \u00fb with a falling tone, or a low tone. The low vowels are intermediate in length between short and",
