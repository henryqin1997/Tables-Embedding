            "Random fact #3: When I first interviewed Justin Masterson, a couple of weeks after he was drafted, I asked him to describe himself as a pitcher. He said, \"Shoot, I'm a two-seamer guy. A lot of people call it a sinker, but it's a fastball to me. It's kind of like a lefty slider.\" (David Laurila)",

    "textBeforeTable": "BP Roundtables IP, H, K are the first three I like out, but everything is taken into account. Next Derek Lowe just might be Justin Masterson. (Kevin Goldstein) Hey KG, what particular stats do you focus on when considering a pitching prospect? Does some stat that takes into account ability to induce ground balls come into play? And, finally, what pitchers have a chance to develop into the next Derek Lowe / Jake Westbrook? Thanks. (Mario66 from Toronto) 2008-01-09 13:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) The latter. Strongly the latter. (Will Carroll) When I first saw Justin Masterson pitch it seemed like he could be so much more effective if he threw from a higher arm slot to really take advantage of his size. Then again, he already gets a lot of ground balls so maybe the time investment and risk of totally messing up his development just wasn't worth it. Your thoughts? (Jeremy from New England) 2008-05-22 13:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) Youz Can Haz. It's a difficult question. On many teams, a No. 3 starter. On the Red Sox, maybe not. (Kevin Goldstein)",
