Data granules will contain approximately 23 minutes (1/4 orbit) of data. summary GLAH05 contains scientific investigations of surface features defined by the waveform parameterization. File contains range corrections and the parameterizations of the waveform that were used to calculate surface elevation, and other surface characteristics. The data values were used as input data values to compute parameters on GLAH06 and GLAH12-15. Each GLAH05 file was created from an equivalent GLA05 binary formatted file.
