            "The sororities and fraternities have started a new program where you can call them when you're ready to go home and they will either give you a ride or come out in groups to walk you back safely to your dorm.",
            "Greek life is very important on campus and is well populated. Great way to make new friends.",
            "Activities are well advertised and fun to join in on. Comedy shows occur every week and school wide parties every month.",
            "Social bunnies interested in sorority/fraternity life and people who like to party.",
            "Christmas in Christ Chapel is celebrated every year with a bunch of performances from all different areas of study. It is one of the prized traditions at Gustavus.",
            "This school is a little overpriced in my opinion. And financial aid is hard to come, so start browsing online soon. Once you hit senior year, a lot of scholarships that they provide will go away.",
            "Traying on the hill is a favorite past time during the winter months, grab a tray from the cafeteria and sled to your hearts delight. They also have monthly plans for students to have fun together, and posters are everywhere to remind you to join in.",
            "Food is great, but can be slightly repetitive as they serve the same thing on the same day every week. The lunch room is a great place to meet new people though, very friendly.",
            "This is where I struggled the most. Because it is a party school, the dorms can be quite noisy and dirty. Once out of your freshman year, its best to aim for an on campus apartment to avoid it.",
            "Classes are moderately difficult, make sure to keep good study habits throughout the semester, not just around finals and tests and you'll do fine.",
            "Join a club, get to know your roommate and get out there. The experience is more fun if you get out and make friends when you first arrive.",
            "Gustavus is a small quiet college in the middle of farm country. It is a party school, so there is a lot going on during weekends and vacation time on campus. Classes are interesting, but try to avoid 8am classes, they are hard to stay awake for!"
