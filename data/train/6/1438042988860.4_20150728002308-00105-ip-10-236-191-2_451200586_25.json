When the overall result fails to show efficacy, usually subgroup findings are not acceptable and subgroup analyses at best can be exploratory or hypothesis generating analyses (ICH E-3 guidelines, section 11.4.2.8: These analyses are not intended to \"salvage\" an otherwise non-supportive study but may suggest hypotheses worth examining in other studies or be helpful in refining labelling information, patient selection, dose selection etc.).\u00a0 When one starts to do multiple subgroups testing, one can easily make a false positive claim based on such subgroup analysis.\u00a0 We do not know how to interpret the P-values based on such post-hoc analysis.\u00a0 Furthermore, without replication of the results in a second well-controlled study, the subgroup analysis can not be ruled out for a false positive result.
