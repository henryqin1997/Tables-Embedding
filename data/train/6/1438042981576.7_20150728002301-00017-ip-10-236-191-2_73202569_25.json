Expenditure Rejection Reasons Using Budgetary Controls, Oracle Project Management User Guide Funds Check Activation in Oracle Purchasing and Oracle Payables Related Topics Note: You must create a baseline version for the budget before the funds check processes can funds check transactions. You can review Oracle Projects funds check results online. The system displays results for transactions that pass a funds check and transactions that fail a funds check. When a transaction is charged to a project, funds check processes are activated in both General Ledger and Oracle Projects. Funds checks are activated for new transactions and for adjusted transactions.

Expenditures created using external cost collection systems are validated during the Submit and Transaction Import processes, but before Oracle Projects creates an expenditure.
