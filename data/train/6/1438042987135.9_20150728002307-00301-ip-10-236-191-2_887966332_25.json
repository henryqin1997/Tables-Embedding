    "textAfterTable": "Although I always wished for the full college experience since I was in my last high school years, GHC has made my 2 yr community college experience a very productive and different one. I believe beginning at a community college is the best choice for someone who wants to really focus in bringing their GPA up, and taking the hard classes first, becomes despite their difficulty, the fact that you get to be one-on-one with your professors makes it easier mentally and physically. Mentally, due to the professor knowing you by name, and being way more personal with you than at a 4 yr university. Physically, because you can see from up close what they are doing, you can hear with clarity everything they are saying, etc. Am learning a lot Georgia Highlands College was my first choice as a community college. I applied due to its low priced tuition for in-state students, the smaller classrooms (which improve the learning environment in the transition of high school to college), the fact that it is very close to home (I can get there in within fifteen minutes without traffic, twenty to twenty five with traffic). I have learned a lot overall in my these past two semester I have attended. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
