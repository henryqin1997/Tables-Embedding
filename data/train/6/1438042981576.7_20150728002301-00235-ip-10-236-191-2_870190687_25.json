No. 49, 1868]. The great study of street names and their history post-1708 was published in 1879 [see City Doc. No. 119 for 1879, Appendix J]. This included the work in 1860, but the problem was it only focused on Boston proper and many more towns had been annexed by that time.

The appointment of teachers, however, still remained the prerogative of the School Committee. In 1876, the rules and regulations were revised and considerable nominal power was granted to the Superintendent and Supervisors, but the appointment of teachers was retained by the district subcommittees. The newly established Board of Supervisors became a board for the examination and certification of teachers. In 1884, the Superintendent was given additional powers. He was to be held responsible to the School Board as the executive in the department of instruction over all supervisors, principals, and other instructors., 947214=Section 65 of Chapter 2 of the Ordinances of 1954 reorganized the Treasury Department by abolishing the office of City Treasurer and substituting therefore the office of Collector-Treasurer., 768827=50.

Most of this data survives today., 266230=Historical Boston, then only the land of a peninsula, was a faction of the land mass it is today after massive land-fill projects of the mid- to late-19th century (the rubble from the Great Boston Fire of 1872 help fill in the waterfront) and the annexing of six towns from two counties (as listed above). Boston was first settled by passengers of the Winthrop Fleet of 1630 who first lodged in Charlestown. These first settlers were Puritans, the religious group wanting to change the Church of England from working inside the church. Called the \"City on the Hill\" by Gov. John Winthrop, the \"hub\" as we now call it became the center of trade, education, government, wealth, and power. It was the capital of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, then the Royal colony of Massachusetts, and finally the Commonwealth of Massachusetts., 784248=58.

It was the largest town in British North America for the first hundred years. Because of that, the town and later city became a draw for immigrants from around the world. Though the first two hundred years saw mostly English arrivals, Scots, Irish, and French were found here, too. It was after 1820 that immigrants from other European countries started arriving in large numbers. The gate was opened by the Irish fleeing the potato famine in 1847. The next wave included more Irish (their dominance starting in the early 20th century is a testament to their number), but also Germans, Italians, and Syrians. The end of the century saw French Canadians, Russian and Polish Jews, and Swedes arriving. The 21st century brought African Americans from the South, Southeast Asian immigrants (especially Chinese and Vietnamese), Muslims, and Puerto Ricans. Many other ethnicities can be found in pockets all over Boston, and walking in downtown one will likely here many languages being spoken., 473816=2.

The Vade Mecum for America (Boston, 1732) was the first commercial guide designed for travellers. After the Revolution, some names of English or Royal bent were changed. The town ordered a new list made and it was recorded in the Town Records in 1788 that was recorded in book 8 starting on page 81. A second unofficial list was published called Names of the Streets, Lanes and Alleys in the Town of Boston in 1800. Street lists began to appear in the Boston City directories starting in 1803. The next official list came in 1834 when the 1708 and 1788 lists were reprinted and then updated with streets in the annexed South Boston, formerly Dorchester Neck. This was reprinted later the same year. An update to this report was published in 1842.

Franklin Street Church and later Central Church or Central Congregational Church [Trinitarian], 1835-1931., 322296=To understand the issues with the vital records for Boston, we need to understand its history. Massachusetts Bay enacted laws early on for the recording of vital events. The town of Boston dutifully recorded these events. From a study by Lemuel Shattuck using the baptismal records, he determined that the practice of civil recording of births saw a slow and steady decline since 1725 when the reported rate of was 3.3% (religious baptisms were near 5%) and down to 2.0% by 1845 (i.e. less than half of what should be expected). Turning to marriages, Shattuck found that the rate of marriages was relatively unchanged all the way up to 1845. He observed two gaps that should be noted. From 1663 to 1689, not one marriage was recorded in the civil records, and from 1751 to 1761 only a few marriages were found. Deaths were well recorded in the early years, but like the marriages, none appear from 1663 to 1689. A separate volume was used after this period and seem to be representative until 1719. But, from 1719 to 1810, few deaths were recorded. In 1810, recording was done by the Superintendent of Burials so then appear complete from then forward. Shattuck found that from 1704 to 1774, sextons made weekly returns to the newspapers for the number who died each week. In this period as the town grew, the annual average death toll rose from 334 to 521, so many thousands of deaths were not recorded. These gaps and issues should be kept in mind when using Boston vital records.

On January 1, 1859, two new steam engines were put in service replacing two hand engines. On October 24, 1873, the City Council passed an ordinance creating a Board of Fire Commissioners to oversee the department.

Deer Island Cemetery, Deer Island, Boston Harbor, 1847., 344381=Boston city directories are one of the most complete record of the city's adult male population, business women, and later the widows of the men previously listed. Boston was the third place to start publishing directories (after New York and Philadelphia) in 1789. They were published annually (for the most part) after 1825. The directory evolved from a simple entry (ex. Herring Ebenezer, mason and sexton, Lynde-street) to one of name, occupation and location, residence (boarding or house), and would list you if you worked in the city but lived elsewhere (then it would name the town of residence). Added features were usually a map (often not digitized and missing), lists of a few trades (such as lawyer, physician, etc.), a few civic items (fire companies, justices, etc.), and business advertisements. More categories appeared over time. By the later 1800s, when someone was being dropped because they died, their death date would be given, or moved, their new town of residence was given. By 1930, there was a very helpful reverse directory added (arranged by street). This resource ceased publication in 1981. The years published are:, 355756=The town of Boston was divided into companies, or districts, to help keep the order, fighting fires, etc. The concept of the Ward was first codified in 1735. The Overseers of the Poor were having difficulty covering the whole town and proposed to divide the town into twelve wards. The freemen agreed and added that these wards would be the districts for \"military considerations,\" too. The division was given to the Overseers to create and the resulting report for such divisions was accepted by the freeman with the caveat that these boundaries would stay in force until the town decided to change them.[See A Report of the Record Commissioners of the City of Boston Containing the Boston Records from 1729 to 1742 (Boston, 1885) [i.e. v. 12], 127, 131-133.] The next change in the ward boundaries came in 1805.

Wards were drawn and redefined in 1822, 1838, 1850, 1865, 1875, 1895, 1914, and 1924. The 1875 was set aside by the court and never officially used. These ward boundaries were defined in A Catalogue of the City Councils of Boston, 1822-1890, Roxbury, 1846-1867, Charlestown, 1847-1873 and of the selectmen of Boston, 1634-1822, also of various other town and municipal officers (Boston, 1891), xxxix, 270 pp. (Boston, 2nd ed., 1909), 402 pp., at pages 7 through 40 [see WorldCat (Other Libraries); Not at FHL; online at Internet Archive, Google Books, and Hathi Trust (1909 ed.); and in the Municipal Register for 1912, 1924, and 1927 [WorldCat (Other Libraries); Not at FHL; online links for all years, see the Boston Public Library].}",
