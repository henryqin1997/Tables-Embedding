It is a small community, where we start gaining experience from the first semester. At Marian, I will be entering my second semester of my sophomore year in August. When I went to visit a friend at Marian, I fell in love with the campus and the people. The professors are very hands-on in their approach of teaching and really want us to achieve all of our goals. I believe that God has a plan for me, and I strongly believe that plan is to continue school at Marian University to go on to be a teacher and change the lives of children and let them reach for the stars., 89319=Marian University is a nice community. I transferred here from California and although its not home, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. The professors I had this semester were down to earth and made it their priority to make sure each student passed. MU is a 15:1 student:teacher ratio., 88739=Spring 2013, was my first semester at MU. I enjoyed going to the basketball games, watching movies in the library theater, and bonfires the dorms would host. Sometimes, my friends and I would meet at the Clair Hall's recreation room and watch NBA games on the bigger screen. Finally, the Ruth Lilly Center has racket ball, two basketball gyms, and a weight room to get in some exercise., 110168=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 89790=Marian is a very beautiful campus that is growing each semester. It is very clean, and the staff/students are friendly. FMO, Marian is a 10:10 rating., 58463=Marian Univeristy is a private Univeristy with accepting role models and motivated students. I love the unique University and rustic features. I am very thrilled and excited to meet the diversity of students and professors while attending here in Spring 2013.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Live on campus for at least your first year! Go to as many campus activities as possible! Don't be scared to talk to anyone, they are all so sweet and willing to help you with any question you have about anything and everything! Get involved in at least one club/committee! Bang for the buck I don't know exactly where ALL of my money goes, but I know that a good portion is referred back to me in many ways. The leftover? Well, I do suppose it has something to do with the new medical center they are building. Most on-campus activities are completely free to students and I foresee it staying that way for a long time. Am enjoying being here I definitely love my choice. I'll admit, at first I wasn't sold that this was going to be the school for me. I thought it was too small for the things I wanted to do, but it has totally shown me different. I love the small atmosphere; everyone knows everyone and they are probably the nicest and most inviting people compared to any school in the country. There is ALWAYS something going on around campus and we have amazing school spirit! Doyle Hall, the dormitory where all on-campus freshmen live,",
