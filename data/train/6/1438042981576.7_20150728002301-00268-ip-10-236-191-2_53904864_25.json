The rookie made some mistakes, however, on his next two series., 78112=The march was sparked after the Bucs' Leonard Johnson was called for a holding penalty on what would have been a Jets three-and-out. Instead the drive continued, and Smith showed poise by completing 5-of-6 throws to get the Jets to the Tampa Bay 12, where Folk connected on a 30-yard field goal to give New York a 15-14 lead with 5:09 remaining., 77147=Revis, less than 12 months removed from ACL surgery on his left knee, looked spry as ever while diving for deflections in his Tampa Bay debut.
