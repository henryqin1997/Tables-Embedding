Under the proposal, a benefit resulting from rollover amounts generally would not be subject to PBGC's maximum guaranteeable benefit or phase-in limitations and would be in the second highest priority category of benefits in the allocation of assets. PBGC is now finalizing that proposal. Except for making minor clarifications suggested by commenters, the final regulation is the same as the proposed regulation. This rulemaking is part of PBGC's efforts to enhance retirement security by promoting lifetime income options., 28918=This final rule amends the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's regulations on Benefits Payable in Terminated Single-Employer Plans and Allocation of Assets in Single-Employer Plans to prescribe interest assumptions under the benefit payments regulation for valuation dates in April 2014 and interest assumptions under the asset allocation regulation for valuation dates in the second quarter of 2014.
