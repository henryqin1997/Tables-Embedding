These can range from a campus drag show to a movie screening to a hypnotist or magician. We also host over 60 clubs and organizations, including fraternities and sororities (both social and professional), service clubs, social clubs, and intramural sports. East Falls, the neighborhood in which PhilaU is situated, has several amenities such as local restaurants, shops, and chain stores (RiteAid, Dunkin' Donuts). The main intersection in East Falls (Midvale Ave & Ridge Ave) is about a 10 minute walk from the freshman residence halls. Manayunk, a thriving neighborhood in Philadelphia (think Main Street USA) is located about 2 miles from campus and is walkable in nice weather. (There is also a bus line which runs there if the weather is inclement.) Manayunk hosts shops, restaurants, and a bar scene for those over 21. I particularly like going into Manayunk in December when they host a winter festival with a tree lighting and ice sculpture carving. Philadelphia at large has a whole host of events happening regularly. Some of my favorites are visiting the museum district, shopping on South Street, or running along Kelly Drive and the Schuylkill River. Others include Philly College Day (in September, a networking event for college students from PhilaU and five or six other local colleges) which takes place on the Ben Franklin Parkway in front of the Art Museum and the Rocky Steps., 89759=Residential life in the residence halls is full of stories. Ronson Hall has had a mold infestation this past academic year (Fall2011-Spring2012), and to solve the problem students were simply relocated. Mott Hall, that I know of, is the only resident hall that lacks a lounge common space. Partridge Hall was not put into use this past academic year. As for the upcoming year, the school could not house all of students so the unassisted were left to come up with where to reside. As far as roommates is concerned halls like Fortess Hall, there can be up to four people in one large room, known as a quad. Having more than two people in a space can and will cause issues. If a strong agreement is made on rules from the beginning, with all parties following the rules accordingly then there will be no trouble. Since Fortess Hall is the only all-girl's dorm on campus, there lies inevitable drama within its walls. At the end of the year there were various complaints coming from other students on how the school had nickel and dime'd them for pre-existing building conditions, and rather rule it was a lack of moving-in declaration it was ruled as student-inflicted damage, accompanied by a sneering fine.}",
