    "textBeforeTable": "Feature History for Implementing GMPLS UNI There is a weak trust model between the entities operating the optical and packet networks. The optical and packet network are managed by different service providers. Different groups within a service provider are responsible for managing packet and optical networks. A GMPLS overlay model is required to connect packet routers with the optical network in these scenarios: The Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User Network Interface (UNI) creates a circuit connection between two clients (UNI-C) of an optical network. This connection is achieved by signaling exchanges between UNI Client (UNI-C) and UNI Network (UNI-N) nodes, where UNI-C nodes are router nodes and UNI-N nodes are optical nodes.

Installation of the Cisco\u00a0IOS\u00a0XR software mini-image on the router. Installation of the Cisco IOS XR MPLS software package on the router. Restrictions for Implementing GMPLS UNI The total number of configured GMPLS UNI controllers should not exceed the platform scale limit of 500 GMPLS interfaces. Each UNI-N (ingress or egress) should be routable from its adjacent UNI-C. The UNI-C nodes need to be routable from the UNI-N nodes too. GMPLS UNI is supported only over DWDM controllers and so, over POS and GigabitEthernet interfaces. GMPLS UNI is supported only with these Cisco ASR 9000 Enhanced Ethernet Line Cards: A9K-MOD80-SE : 80G Modular Line Card, Service Edge Optimized",
