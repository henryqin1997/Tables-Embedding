OSMT can load multiple versions of object-oriented programs (e.g. Java, C#, etc.), parse and extract both formal and informal analysis information from programs, and provide the following supports for software maintenance: 1) Recovery and visualization of class diagrams and other UML diagrams; 2) High-level design structure recovery by program clustering; 3) Object-oriented design-level evolution analysis and visualization; 4) Refactoring recommendations for design improvement; 5) Integration with clone analysis tools like CCFinder to combine code clone information into program understanding, evolution analysis and refactoring recommendations.",
