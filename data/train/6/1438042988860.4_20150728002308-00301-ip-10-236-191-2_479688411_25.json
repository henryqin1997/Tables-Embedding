    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{139156=We were able to produce comparable fiber from the blends. The 50:50 blend could not be cross-linked via heat as the fibrous structure was destroyed. Heating 65:35 blend below 90 degree C. for 12 hours improves the chemical resistance of the resultant fibers to resist dissolution in alcohol. Blends of polyamide with epoxy resin, such Epon 828 from Shell and Epi-Rez 510 can be used., 141131=Oligomers of para-tert-butyl phenol, molecular weight range 400 to 1100, was purchased from Enzymol International, Columbus, Ohio. These low molecular weight polymers are soluble in low alcohols, such as ethanol, isopropanol and butanol. These polymers were added to co-polyamide described earlier and electrospun into 0.2 micron fibers without adverse consequences. Some polymers and additives hinder the electrospinning process. Unlike the conventional phenolic resin described in Example 2, we have found that this group of polymers does not interfere with fiber forming process., 181935=DSC of 50:50 blend shows lack of melting temperature. Copolyamide has melting temperature around 150 degree C. and Bisphenol A resin is a glassy polymer with Tg of about 100. The blend shows lack of distinct melting. When the fiber mat is exposed to 100 degree C., the fiber mat disappears. This blend would make an excellent filter media where upper use temperature is not very high, but low-pressure drop is required. This polymer system could not be crosslinked with a reasonable manner., 56816=This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09/871,583, filed May 31, 2001, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,743,273 on Jun. 1, 2004, which claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 60/230,138, filed Sep. 5, 2000, which applications are incorporated herein by reference., 154998=Type 8 Nylon was originally developed to prepare soluble and crosslinkable resin for coating and adhesive application. This type of polymer is made by the reaction of polyamide 66 with formaldehyde and alcohol in the presence of acid. (Ref. Cairns, T. L.; Foster, H. D.; Larcher, A. W.; Schneider, A. K.; Schreiber, R. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949, 71, 651). This type of polymer can be elctrospun and can be cross-linked. However, formation of fiber from this polymer is inferior to copolyamides and crosslinking can be tricky., 111206=In preferred arrangements, the first layer of permeable coarse fibrous material comprises a material which, if evaluated separately from a remainder of the construction by the Frazier permeability test, would exhibit a permeability of at least 1 meter(s)/min, and typically and preferably about 2\u2013900 meters/min. Herein when reference is made to efficiency, unless otherwise specified, reference is meant to efficiency when measured according to ASTM-1215-89, with 0.78 \u03bc monodisperse polystyrene spherical particles, at 20 fpm (6.1 meters/min) as described herein., 181561=50:50 blend of Bisphenol A resin of M.W. 3,000 and copolyamide was made in ethanol solution. Total concentration in solution was 10%. Copolyamide alone would have resulted in 0.2 micron fiber diameter. Blend resulted in lofty layer of fibers around 1 micron. Bisphenol A of 7,000 M.W. is not stable with copolyamide and tends to precipitate., 238802=A 4\u2033 diameter sample is cut from the media. Particle capture efficiency of the test specimen is calculated using 0.8 \u03bcm latex spheres as a test challenge contaminant in the LEFS (for a description of the LEFS test, see ASTM Standard F1215-89) bench operating at 20 FPM. The sample is then submerged in (typically 140\ufffd F.) distilled water for 5 minutes. The sample is then placed on a drying rack and dried at room temperature (typically overnight). Once it is dry the sample is then retested for efficiency on the LEFS bench using the same conditions for the initial calculation.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The above specification, examples and data provide an explanation of the invention. However, many variations and embodiments can be made to the disclosed invention. The invention is embodied in the claims herein after appended. Pass/Fail Criteria: >50% efficiency retention. The sample is then placed on a drying rack and dried at room temperature (typically overnight). Once it is dry the sample is then retested for efficiency on the LEFS bench using the same conditions for the initial calculation. The previous steps are repeated for the fine fiber supporting substrate without fine fiber. From the above information one can calculate the efficiency component due only to the fine fiber and the resulting loss in efficiency due to alcohol damage. Once the loss in efficiency due to the fine fiber is determined one can calculate the amount of efficiency retained. A 4\u2033 diameter sample is cut from the media. Particle capture efficiency of the test specimen is calculated using 0.8 \u03bcm latex spheres as a test challenge contaminant in the LEFS bench operating at 20 FPM. The sample is then submerged in alcohol for 1 minute. In most industrial pulse cleaning filter applications the filter would perform adequately if at least 50% of the fine fiber efficiency is retained. Alcohol (Ethanol) Soak Test Description: The test",
