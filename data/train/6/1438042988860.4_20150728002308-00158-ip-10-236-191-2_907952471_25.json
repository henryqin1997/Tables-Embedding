            "The atmosphere is so relaxed, yet there is still an intellectual vibe. The weather is wonderful, the downtown area is very charming, and we are only a few minutes away from the beach, beautiful hikes, and other outdoorsy things. Everything has a small town feel, and the community works really hard to be environmentally friendly, sustainable, and an overall great place. Oh, and BBQ galore. Mmmm",
            "I came into college thinking that I was med school bound, but after taking just one quarter of general chemistry I figured out that chemistry was what I had a passion for. Our motto is learn by doing, and I am definitely learning a ton, hands on. I am already doing research for one of my chemistry professors. That's something not everyone gets to do."

Cal Poly subsidizes the SLO bus system, so you can travel anywhere around town for free. Beaches, outlet shopping and an interactive comedy show are a 15 minute drive away. We are halfway between LA and SF., 432310=The new recreation center just opened this January and has 9300 square feet of machinery alone! Plus, it even has filtered water dispensers!, 51142=It is the best college in the United States. It has an amazing engineering program for the relatively low cost. It is in the happiest place in the USA according to USAtoday. http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/story/2011/04/San-Luis-Obispo-Its-the-happiest-place-in-the-USA-/45900412/1, 130651=Ever since Carson, a freshman from the class of 2012, died of alcohol poisoning campus safety has become a top priority. Since it is a small town it is tight-knit, so if something happens its spreads quickly., 830176=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 620885=The residential housing communities at Cal Poly are pretty good. Freshmen stay in the Connections halls (Sierra Madre and Yosemite Halls,) the Living and Learning communities (The major specific, Red Brick halls,) and North Mountain Halls. Also, Cal Poly has a multi-class residence community located on top of the campus mountain known as Cerro Vista which features suite/apartment style living. Beginning in the 2013-14 school year, freshman students will be put into Poly Canyon Village, the student housing complex reserved for Second years and above. In the Connections halls, towers are assigned by theme and admitted students can choose the themes that they want to be placed in. In Yosemite hall, the floors are unisex, whereas in Sierra Madre the halls segregate by floor., 8089=Though it is primarily an Engineering and Agricultural school, our other majors have a lot to offer..take Liberal Arts for instance. Our Performing arts Centers...yes that's plural...and Music facilities and Band are state of the art and Best of the West as you can get. If there are any Animal Science perspective Aggie's for Cal Poly i can answer any question you may have as well. Also! Any incoming Freshmen have questions about the school or the town I am also bursting with info as a 2009 Week Of Welcome orientation Leader aka WOW! and one more thing....if your coming to Cal Poly? WOW is a must!! ~aventimi@calpoly.edu, 3578=I have just finished my first year at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and can honestly say I can\u2019t possibly imagine being happier with a school. To be perfectly honest I wasn\u2019t initially thrilled to be going to Cal Poly, but my family\u2019s financial situation made the ultimate decision for me. Cal Poly has proven to be everything I wanted and more. With each class having around 4500 students, I find the school to be large enough as to be able to have your own identity, yet small enough to have a familial feeling about it. Classes are also well sized, especially for smaller majors like liberal arts. All of my teachers have come to know me personally, and I felt as though I had a respected voice in class. There is a general feeling of acceptance and comfort that flows throughout campus, and it is an incredible community to be a part of. The town leans towards the quaint and quiet side, but it is without a doubt a college dominated area. Cal Poly does a beautiful job of welcoming new students to the campus and the town. It\u2019s overall a homey environment, while offering the education of a UC without the cost. Away from school, I find most of my time to be spent at the beach or downtown. Pismo, Avila, and Morrow Bay are all within 15 minutes, and all have adorable towns to spend the day in. The downtown area of SLO is even within walking distance, although bus transportation is free for all students. SLO is piled high with restaurants fit for students with everything from Thai cuisine to Italian to renown barbeque. I must throw in one last source of entertainment as it is one of the most talked of events on campus--Thursday night line dancing. A weekly affair, the downtown Graduate hosts country music and dancing for 8$ from 8:00-2:00 giving us all a chance to step out with our boots on., 729595=If you end up coming to Cal Poly, JOIN A CLUB I can't stress this enough, there is much more to Cal Poly than going to class and passing it. There are many great clubs, such as Formula SAE, Human Powered Vehicle, Design Build Fly, Cal Poly Space Systems, and many more! I learned so much from working in Supermileage, an engineering club that strives to build the most fuel-efficient car. I got to work with students from different majors, something I would never have done in class. I worked with carbon fiber, designed some parts, and saw our car achieve 1385 mpg.}",
