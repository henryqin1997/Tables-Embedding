Independent elements forming with Verbs miyu chiishinkaau preverb verb stem good it is day English Translation: It is a good day Independent elements forming with Nouns mishtikw napaau stem stem wood man English Translation: carpenter Gender, Number, Person[edit] Gender is a grammatical distinction. Within gender, East Cree has 'Animate' and 'Inanimate' gender differentiation. However, unless you are a fluent speaker of the language, it is really hard to know for sure if words are animate or inanimate. Animate words refer to humans, animals, general living creatures, also including some plants and some personal belongings such as pants and sled. To indicate the plural you add suffix -ich, or in some cases when the word ends with a w, you drop the w and add -uch.
