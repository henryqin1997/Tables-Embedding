    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Union has excellent health-related programs and a top-of-the-line education program. Tips for prospective students I highly recommend making campus visits, talking to advisors from your discipline, and KEEP searching for financial aid. Bang for the buck While an education at Union College is quite pricey, I definitely agree that it is worth every last cent. Am enjoying being here I made friends right away when I came to Union and I can already tell that we will be friends for life. The people here make everything worthwhile. Everybody is so inviting and friendly that it's hard to not have a good time. Am learning a lot Professors at Union have an impressive knowledge of the content area and related areas of knowledge. They also strive to connect interdisciplinary ways of thinking and provide an all-around excellent educational experience. There is a very good combination of lecture and discussion at Union College.
