    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{27828=The sheer number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured in U.S. traffic collisions each year is an important consideration in the Nation's highway transportation system. The NHTSA estimated that 5,300 pedestrians were killed in the United States during 1997 (Traffic Safety Facts, 1997). NHTSA also reported 77,000 nonfatal injuries. Casualties of this magnitude take on even greater meaning in view of the national policy to encourage increased walking as a matter of both transportation and health., 3522=It is also of interest to consider pedestrian fatalities as a percentage of total traffic fatalities. During 1927, pedestrian deaths accounted for 41.9 percent of total traffic deaths. That percentage has declined and was 14.1 percent of the total in 1996, a substantial decline from 1927 (figure 5). Increased travel by car is one factor in that change. Evans (1991), among others, has reported that the higher the degree of motorization in a country, the number of motor vehicles per 100,000 population, the lower the proportion of pedestrian deaths to total traffic deaths. The proportion of pedestrian deaths declined as the United States progressively became more motorized. This trend also is seen in less motorized countries (Choueiri et al., 1993)., 37588=U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE Washington, DC 20590 202-366-4000, 24925=The NSC annually publishes an estimate of U.S. pedestrian deaths for the most recent year available, as well as for years as far back as 1927 (Accident Facts, 1995, 1996, 1997 editions). The estimated number of pedestrian fatalities for 1927 was 10,820, as shown in table 4. The pedestrian death count irregularly grew until 1937, when 15,500 pedestrian deaths were reported, the largest number in U.S. history. Thereafter, the number declined. The number of pedestrian fatalities exceeded 10,000 during 1969, 1972, and 1973, and since then decreased to 6,100 in 1996. It should be noted that the NSC estimating procedure was changed in 1987 and the annual number of deaths it reported became substantially lower beginning that year., 2756=This influence of car travel was highlighted by the U.S. experience during World War II when there was an interruption in the steady decline in pedestrian fatalities as a percentage of total traffic fatalities. The pedestrian fatalities were 33.9 percent in 1941. During the war years (1942-1945) the total abruptly jumped to values between 38 and 41 percent. In 1947, the figure reversed again to a new low of 32 percent, and after 1949 did not again reach 30 percent (See table 4). The increase during World War II probably reflected the fact that motor vehicle mileage fell during those years because civilian vehicle production gave way to military needs, and the existing civilian motor vehicle fleet amassed drastically fewer miles because of gasoline and tire (that is, rubber) rationing. It is also likely that the characteristics of highway users changed during that period, what with millions of young men away in the military, plus unprecedented numbers of women in the work force. It should be noted that Choueiri et al. (1993) show a greater pedestrian death decline in Europe during recent years than in the United States.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{146524=A 1980 study by Habib identified causal factors related to pedestrian crashes at intersection crosswalks and recommended possible solutions. While 51.4 percent of such pedestrian crashes in Habib's study involved a through vehicle, left-turn vehicle maneuvers were involved twice as often as right-turn crash maneuvers (24.8 percent vs. 13.1 percent). The left-turn maneuver was nearly four times as hazardous as the through-movement in terms of collisions and exposure. Also, driver error was found to increase when the left-turn movement was made as compared with right-turn maneuvers. Factors identified as contributing to the left-turn crashes with pedestrians include driver visibility problems, poor driver habits, and signal location., 153471=Many factors characterize pedestrian crashes. Some lend themselves to traffic engineering intervention to improve safety, but others are associated with general societal characteristics and generally beyond the traffic engineer's influence. For example, the 1990 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (Antonakos, 1995) characterized pedestrians as: slightly lower in socioeconomic status; less likely to be employed; less likely to own a motor vehicle; and less likely to be licensed to drive a motor vehicle., 63008=More males than females are seen in every single age category for fatal crashes (table 8). The ratio of male to female deaths varies from 3.6 to 1 in the 21 to 24 age group, down to 1.3 to 1 in the oldest age group. Despite the greater numbers of females compared to males in the 65+ age group, males slightly outnumber females in pedestrian fatalities; indicating that if the male and female populations in this age group were equal, the ratio of male to female fatalities would be even higher. Even in the youngest age group, pedestrians less than 5 years of age, the ratio of deaths among boys compared with girls is 1.7 to 1. In one study, boys were found to be involved in about twice as many pedestrian crashes as girls from 5 to 7 (AAA Pedestrian Safety Report 1984, 1977). Such differences between males and females have been observed for pedestrians as young as 2 years old. In an analysis of all pedestrian collisions in North Carolina for 1993, 1994, and 1995, crash records of 1,336 pedestrians were reviewed for those 12 years old or younger (Campbell, 1996). In this group, 61 percent were male. Even among 3-year-olds in pedestrian crashes, 62 percent were male; among 2-year-olds, 66 percent were males. Only for the 2-year-old and younger category (54 percent male) did the proportion approach the baseline proportion of males seen in birth statistics. This indicates the possibility of fundamental differences between the behavior of young boys and girls, and/or in the way they are supervised, even as toddlers., 76324=A 1992 study by Dickman and Cope (1992) reported on 4,329 injured pedestrians, of whom 2,109 (49 percent) had been drinking. The blood alcohol levels were:, 155881=Other data sources indicate that, in some pedestrian crashes, the police report indicates that the pedestrian is not injured. The injury scale shown here is one used by many police departments. The five-category scale is shown below along with the injury distribution reported by Hunter et al., 1996, who reported on 5,073 pedestrian crashes., 111490=\"Hit and run\" is a somewhat larger category in the driver group, but such a classification tells nothing about the driver's actions that contributed to the crash, only that unlawful flight took place afterwards. Some characteristics of the hit-and-run situation are presented for fatal crashes in a 1995 study (Solnick and Hemenway, 1995). The authors examined the FARS database for 1989-1991 and listed factors that were over- or underrepresented in fatal hit-and-run situations. Overall, 20 percent of drivers left the scene:, 35485=Table 8 shows that the largest percentage of pedestrian deaths is seen for the two age groups that span the 25-44 year age range. A total of 31.8 percent (15.4 percent + 16.4 percent) of pedestrian fatalities occur in this age range, a greater percentage than for the 5 preceding age groups combined. (Note the varying age intervals used in this table prepared by NHTSA [Traffic Accident Facts, 1995.] The 25-34 age category spans 10 years while the next lower category (21-24) only covers 4 years. Thus, the 15.4 percent of fatalities that falls in the 25-34 year category is not as much greater as might appear when compared with the next younger category, since the latter includes data from less than half as many years. Note also that 13.9 percent of fatalities fall in the oldest category [greater than 75 years old]; however, the open-ended age span of this category includes data from more years than the immediately preceding category. Overall, more than twice as many male pedestrians (3742) are killed as female (1727) pedestrians., 155050=Although many pedestrians are killed in motor vehicle collisions, most pedestrian collisions do not result in fatal injuries, in spite of pedestrians' vulnerability in a collision with a 908-kg or 2000-lb rigid motor vehicle. Data from NHTSA (Traffic Safety Facts, 1995) show that in 1994 there were:, 66750=A study of motor vehicle fatalities in North Carolina between 1972 and 1989 (figure 13) showed that between 42 and 61 percent of pedestrian fatalities involved pedestrians under the influence of alcohol (i.e., BAC of 0.10 percent or greater). This compared with the range of 53 to 64 percent of drivers of single-vehicle collisions who were under the influence. Among 176 fatally injured pedestrians tested in 1989 (Rehabilitation Alcohol Test, 1990), the following distribution was reported:, 132981=Several major U.S. studies of pedestrian behavior were based on field observations, on interviews with pedestrian safety professionals, and on data from collision reports (AAA Pedestrian Safety Report, 1984; Rehabilitation Alcohol, 1990; Accident Facts, 1988). These studies categorized crash types for urban, rural, and freeway locations as shown in Tables 17, 18, and 19 (Model Pedestrian User's Manual, 1987 edition, Knoblauch, 1975; Knoblauch, 1977; and Knoblauch, 1978). The objective of these studies was to identify crash causes and to develop countermeasures., 78275=Another factor related to the \"who\" of pedestrian crashes is vehicle type. In a NHTSA report (Traffic Safety Facts, 1995, table 93), pedestrian collision percentages with regard to vehicle type are:, 18664=Among the sample of pedestrian collisions (Hunter et al., 1996), 62 percent happened during the day between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Consistent with those daytime numbers are other findings, based on data from urban areas. These show general agreement that the peak time for pedestrian crashes is between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. This peak represents about 30 to 40 percent of the collisions (Fatal Accident Reporting System, 1990; Knoblauch, 1977; Davis and Huelke, 1969; Cove, 1990) and the proportion decreases on either side of this period. Smaller secondary peaks from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and Noon to 1 p.m. were reported by Smeed (1968)., 107168=A 1977 survey of child pedestrian crashes in more than 1,900 cities indicated that approximately 75 percent occurred at non-intersection locations. This increases to between 80 and 90 percent for the 5-year-old-and-under age group (AAA Pedestrian Safety Report, 1984). This high percentage is likely associated in part with the high incidence of young children running into the street at midblock locations., 19315=NHTSA figures (Traffic Safety Facts, 1995) show that the distribution by time of occurrence for pedestrian injuriesis somewhat similar to that of all collisions (about 63 percent of injuries concentrated from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., compared with 61 percent for all collisions). This was also reported by Cove (1990), showing pedestrian injury crashes to have a major peak between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. and a minor peak between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., based on data from the National Accident Sampling System (see figure 7)., 170358=In 1977, Knoblauch developed a hazard index, defined as the ratio of the frequency with which any particular attribute was present in the crash sample to the frequency with which it was present in the general population at the site (base rate), at approximately the same time of day. Tables 23 and 24 show the relative hazards of pedestrian and vehicle actions derived in this manner. Table 23 shows that while crossing at a location other than an intersection was the most frequent action identified in the pedestrian crash sample, when compared with non-involved pedestrian actions at the site, it is a substantially less hazardous action than, for example, standing in the roadway. Similarly, out-of-control and backing vehicles are shown to be extremely hazardous to the pedestrian compared with turning vehicles. This procedure did not take collision severity into account when defining a hazard index (fortunately, these collisions are of low severity). The hazard index was computed based on the percent of pedestrian crashes divided by the relative exposure. Thus, for example, in table 24, the hazard index for \"vehicle straight ahead\" was relatively safe (hazard index of 0.9), even though 77.2 percent of pedestrian crashes involved a vehicle traveling straight ahead. This is because 85.1 percent of the vehicle exposure involved the straight ahead vehicle movements. Thus, the ratio of crash percentage divided by exposure percentage = (77.2) \u00f7 (85.1) = 0.9, 81255=The rural/urban distribution of pedestrian crashes is given in table 11, based on estimates by the NSC (Accident Facts, 1994). Of the estimated 71,200 pedestrian collisions in the United States in 1993, 75 percent occurred in urban areas, where pedestrian traffic is much higher than in rural areas. The table also shows that rural areas account for only 23.1 percent of nonfatal injury pedestrian crashes, but 45.2 percent of fatal pedestrian crashes. The overrepresentation of fatalities in rural areas is most likely because of the higher speeds and more severe crash types in rural areas., 32990=Consistent with the above, a study conducted in Wayne County, MI (Davis and Huelke, 1969) showed that more pedestrians (13 percent) were killed during December than in any other month. A study of rural and urban data samples of U.S. areas (Knoblauch, 1977) showed December to be the month having the greatest overrepresentation. Nationwide pedestrian fatalities in 1989 were found to be highest in September through January (Figure 11), months with fewer daylight hours and more inclement weather., 107594=A 1989 summary of pedestrian injuries and deaths by age was estimated by NHTSA for intersections and nonintersections. As illustrated in figure 16, a majority of crashes involving pedestrians up to age 44 occurs at nonintersections. For ages 45-64, there almost is an equal number of pedestrian crashes at intersections and nonintersections. For pedestrians age 65 and older, the trend reverses, and more are struck at intersections than at nonintersections. Although only limited pedestrian behavioral and survey data are available concerning choice of crossing locations, older pedestrians generally are more likely to cross at intersections than are younger ones (General Estimates System, 1990)., 65491=One study reported that from 1980 and 1989, between 37 and 44 percent of fatally injured pedestrians had BACs of 0.10 percent or greater (Alcohol Fatality Facts, 1990). These percentages were slightly lower than for fatalities involving passengers, vehicle operators, and motorcycle operators. Among adults pedestrians killed in 1989 nighttime collisions with motor vehicles, 59 percent had BACs of 0.10 percent or greater, while only 31 percent had no alcohol in their blood., 89514=Another way of describing pedestrian crashes is by the nature of any traffic control present at the pedestrian crash site. Table 12 is based on the aforementioned 1992 sample of 4,329 pedestrian crashes of all kinds (Diekman and Cope, 1992), and the following overall distribution is seen with respect to traffic controls:}",

Not only is alcohol use by pedestrians a significant factor associated with involvement in a crash, but it is also reported that excessive amounts of alcohol significantly increased the likelihood that death will result from the collision (Miles-Doan, 1996). D. VEHICLE TYPE Another factor related to the \"who\" of pedestrian crashes is vehicle type. In a NHTSA report (Traffic Safety Facts, 1995, table 93), pedestrian collision percentages with regard to vehicle type are: Vehicle Type Pedestrians Killed Pedestrians Injured Passenger car 55.8% 76.5% Light truck 29.2% 20.0% Other (including motor-cycles & heavy trucks) 15.0% 3.5% \u00a0 100% 100% Light trucks as well as the \"other\" vehicle classes are more often represented in fatal pedestrian crashes than in injury crashes. E. SUMMARY: WHO IS INVOLVED IN PEDESTRIAN COLLISIONS? The largest percentage of pedestrian fatalities falls into the 25-44 age category However, when fatalities per 100,000 population is calculated, the oldest age category stands out higher than the rest. Nevertheless, compared with their proportion in the U.S. population, children and young adults ages 2-22 are overrepresented in terms of pedestrian deaths and injuries.",
