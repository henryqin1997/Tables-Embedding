There's a carnival, sledding, and incredibly cheap lift tickets and accommodations for the weekend. Then we have May Days, a spring carnival that is a week long with lawn games, sport tournaments, and booths from the various students organizations., 389328=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 150431=as a stated above, the hockey season ticket campout is a big du tradition. another tradition is winter carnival, which is a weekend in february when lots of students go to winter park (a ski town) and stay there and ski and participate in activities like tubing and concerts. prices for skiing and food are reduced for du students that weekend, and there's a scholarship that you can apply for to cover the cost of a ski lift ticket for one day, meal tickets and a tubing ticket., 224198=In the winter and spring quarters we have a lot of fun activities put on by student based organizations. The best in the winter is Winter Carnival, where students get the opportunity to travel to a mountain town and stay there for discounted prices, and receive lift tickets for discounted prices along with other awesome activities. In the spring we have what we call May Days which is towards the end of the academic year and it is just a week of entertaining activities around campus put on by our students., 215085=Winter Carnival and May Days are very fun events on campus. FREE stuff is given out regularly., 36713=We have May Days which I love. It is a week long event on campus with many different activities such as pancake breakfast on the lawn one morning to a head phone disco at night., 219182=There is a student organization for everything and everyone, but some of the coolest events DU has to offer are the May Days events in the spring and Winter Carnival at Winter Park Ski Resort., 374196=As it is in most colleges, students love to complain about the dining. Personally, I don't think it's too bad. They always have a variety of option for carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores alike, although many students start to get tired of the cycle of food options in a few weeks. They have a good selection of meal plans to choose from. Most people start out with the (most expensive) unlimited meal plan their first quarter at DU, which gives them unlimited access to meals in the dining halls and a hundred bucks to spend at some of the many restaurants around/on campus. However, once you figure out your eating habits, you can easily change meal plans at the end of a quarter to save you the most money. The largest downside to food and dining at DU, however, is the hours of the dining halls. The large, buffet-style cafeterias open and close at the most obscure hours on weekends (you can't get breakfast until 10:00 on Saturdays and Sundays), and they often aren't open around move-in/move-out day. I gave student government a suggestion about this, so hopefully, they'll have this problem fixed soon., 260417=Debate 2012, Fidel Castro daughter was a guest speaker, 152880=the dorms are nice, but the showers are very small. the rooms themselves are pretty big and have huge windows, which is awesome. quiet hours start at 10:00 in freshman buildings (not sure about the sophomore/junior/senior buildings), but it is not always enforced, so sometimes it's best to go to the library if you need absolute quiet to study.}",

Tips for prospective students While it is easy to critique schools for their athletics, facilities and policies, it is important to remember that college is about receiving a higher education. The University of Denver has all of the little things covered as well as providing a wholesome education. Bang for the buck Although at times it may seem like the University is missing a service for students, it's there but you may be looking in the wrong places. The University provides many services and is still adapting to accomodate services that were not previously offered. Am enjoying being here I wouldn't pick any other",
