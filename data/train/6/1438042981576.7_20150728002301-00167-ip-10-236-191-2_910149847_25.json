            "If you are willing to put in the effort to work towards what you want, than there is no type of student that this school is for. Kutztown is for everyone.",
            "My one tip is to do your work. I'm currently a sophomore and i realized just this year how much it takes to keep yourself going. Everyone thinks that Freshman year you can do whatever you want, but keep in mind that your freshman year impacts the rest of your college career just as much as any other year. Another thing, if you guys are looking to talk to new students just like you join this group, its for incoming freshman, class of 2016!! https://www.facebook.com/groups/227049750681385/",
            "Compared to other schools, Kutztown isn't bad with money. Especially since it is a state school, and there are so many opportunities for scholarships.",
            "The campus is beautiful. The people here are great as well, there are many opportunities to be a part of something or be someone on campus. I've made so many friends just being in a dorm setting and these are friends I plan to keep for the rest of my life.",
            "Attending Kutztown was one of my better decisions, The classes aren't so big that you feel like you are overwhelmed and some are even like high school classrooms. If you need help with anything, the professors are always willing to give you extra attention and most of the time if you put in the effort to work harder, they'll give you extra points."

The shuttle runs from 7:30 am till 4pm on week days and from 7:30 am till 3 am on Thursday through Saturday, in case you need to get somewhere safely! The doors to all dorms need to be swiped into with your ID so strangers will never be able to get into the building, and the rooms all have locks and dead bolts so your stuff is safe when you leave!, 118933=we have a festival called bear fest, which has been going on for about 35 years now. in april towards the end of the semester, there is a week long outdoor festival and all of the events are free. the tradition is that on tuesday night, there is a pudding slide. yeah, i said it. pudding slide. there are about 500 gallons of chocolate and vanilla pudding laid out on tarps and students can slide down them, all covered in pudding. great fun, and really fun to watch., 95182=My one tip is to do your work.

Just warning you that if you are looking for a school with alot of activities and things to do on the weekend, you should look elsewhere because the campus is empty on the weekend. Tips for prospective students If you did well in high school I would look into the honors program. You get preferred scheduling and with the number of students that Kutztown has it is hard for freshman to get into the courses they need Bang for the buck Something most students don't realize that if you are a full-time students you are paying the same amount for 12 classes as 18 classes. Kutztown charges you as if you are taking 18 credits so try to take",
