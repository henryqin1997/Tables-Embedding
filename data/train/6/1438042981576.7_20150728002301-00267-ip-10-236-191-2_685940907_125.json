    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{65929=In the early post-war seasons, Ireland hit the front, taking three outright titles including consecutive Triple Crowns in 1948 and 1949. France shared the title in 1954 and 1955 and the \"Tricolores\" won it outright in 1959, driven by stars such as the inspirational lock forward Lucien Mias, fullback Pierre Lacaze and flanker Francois Moncla. They were champions for four years in a row from 1959 to 1962 and in 1968 won their first Grand Slam., 65346=The 1970's brought mixed fortunes for both the Championship and the teams. In 1972 the tournament could not be completed after Scotland and Wales refused to play in Dublin because of the escalating political problems. And the following year the tournament finished with a unique five way tie - every country having won and lost two games., 64184=In 1984, Scotland won their first Grand Slam for 59 years and Ireland scooped the title 12 months later. They have not won it since., 63976=The dominance of England and France during the 1990's brought criticism that the championship was not offering a high enough standard of competition. The response was to bring an end to the historic format by asking Italy to join in 2000., 64932=For Wales, however, the 1970s will be remembered as the golden era of Welsh rugby. They finished the decade with three Grand Slams and one Triple Crown and were led by legendary players such as fullback JPR Williams and scrum-half Gareth Edwards. The Welsh side were absolutely unstoppable. Only an outstanding French side prevented them from adding to the three Grand Slams achieved in this decade. England struggled throughout the 1970s and most of the following decade - their only relief being Bill Beaumont's Grand Slam winning side of 1980. Instead, it was France who dominated, winning the title outright three times, including two Grand Slams in 1981 and 1987., 68782=England and Scotland were the most successful teams in the early days, but by the mid-1890s the Welsh had developed an impressive side and a new system that would alter the face of the game. This \"four three-quarter\" system came into its own in 1893 when Wales became champions for the first time, winning rugby's \"invisible trophy\", the Triple Crown - beating all three other home nations. Their success showed the other Home Union sides that the six backs/nine forwards game would no longer be effective against the Welsh system and four threequarters became the norm at national and club level. By 1900 all of the four Home teams had found success at a game that was rapidly growing in popularity., 67961=In the first decade of the 20th century, Wales were the team to beat. Unbeaten at home between 1900 and 1913, they won six outright titles before England staged a revival that coincided with the 1910 opening of the RFU's new home at Twickenham. The very first international at Twickenham brought England success over Wales, and heralded a golden era for English rugby., 59886=Note: Prior to 1994, teams on equal points shared the championship. Since then, ties have been by the points difference of the teams. The rules of the championship further provide that if teams tie on both match points and points difference, the team which scored the most tries wins the championship. Were this decider be a tie, the tying teams would share the championship. Since its introduction, match points and points difference have been sufficient to decide the championship., 69596=When the English rugby team travelled to Swansea on a dreary day in 1882, few could have realised the importance of the occasion. The game, in which England beat Wales by two goals and four tries to none, sparked a festival of rugby that has since become the pride of the northern hemisphere. Known in the early days as the International Championship - with only England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland competing - it was far less organised than the modern tournament., 63708=In a Celtic revival 1999 saw Scotland take the championship and Wales finished third, having defeated both England and France and in 2000 and 2001, England claimed the tournament - but only after losing their final games against Scotland and Ireland respectively., 71006=The RBS 6 Nations Championship is contested each season over seven weekends during February, March and sometimes April by the international sides of France, England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales., 61405=The 2011 Six Nations could have brought England their first grand slam since 2003 but Ireland beat them convincingly in the penultimate game of the tournament leaving Wales a slim chance of taking the title if they had beat France by a wide margin in the final game later the same day. France, who had lost to Italy earlier in the competition, beat Wales, and England took the title, but the edge was taken off the win by the manner of the loss againt Ireland. Other notable events were Italy's first win against France and Brian O'Driscoll moving ahead of Scotland's Ian Smith (78 year old record) as the championship's all-time leading try scorer with his 25th tournament touchdown early in the second half. The 2012 tournament was a tail of two teams, firstly how the favorites Wales completed the grand slam in style, their second in 5 years and the second for their Southern hemisphere manager Warren Gatland (a new record) then secondly how the England team was completely rebuilt into a competitive outfit by temporary manager Stuart Lancaster in a matter of months to come second and only losing to Wales by one score., 67177=The outbreak of war in 1914 saw the tournament put on hold until 1920 and the inter-war years were dominated by England as they swept to nine championship victories, including five Grand Slams., 63061=France then entered a purple patch winning in 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2007 with only England in 2003 (their world cup winning year) and Wales in 2005 suceeding to break up what would have been a significant period of French domination. In fact in 2007 they only lost once, against England., 62163=The 2010 Six Nations belonged to France as they won the Grand Slam for the first time since 2004. Les Blues were rarely untroubled opening up with an 18-9 win over Scotland before defeating Ireland 33-10, Wales 26-20 and Italy 46-20. France had already won the Championship going into their final game with England after Ireland lost their second game of the tournament to Scotland hours earlier. But despite being pushed by England, who scored the only try of the game, France came out on top 12-10 at the Stade de France to win the Grand Slam. Ireland's 23-20 loss to Scotland in the final game of the campaign not only denied Ireland the Triple Crown but saw Italy receive the dreaded Wooden Spoon for the third year running., 66937=Scotland collected their first Grand Slam in 1925 , with an emphatic win against England at Murrayfield. In 1926 , Scotland became the first Home Union side to defeat England at Twickenham after England had won the Grand Slam (winning the Triple Crown AND beating the French) five times in eight seasons. France continued to struggle and in 1931 the inadequacies of the French game's administration and the discovery that a number of their players had been paid at club level, forced them to pull out of the tournament. Due to this, the championship became an entirely domestic affair for eight years and France rejoined in 1939-40, with the outbreak of World War Two delaying their re-entry for a further eight years., 60220=The 2013 tournament came down to the last game with England chasing a grand slam and Wales looking to win by an 8 point margin to take the championship. Wales did it in style in front of their home fans 30 - 3., 69002=Before the turn of the century the Championship was marred by disputes and three times (in 1885, 1887 and 1889) it could not be completed. Indeed, even after 1900, it continued to be a source of controversy., 70793=Each team plays the other five once per season with home advantage in alternate seasons (eg England hosted France in 2003, and so France host England in 2004), giving a total of 15 matches per Championship., 71536=The Six Nations Championship is the oldest rugby championship in the world, dating back to 1882. Originally held between the four United Kingdom countries England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, France joined in 1910 and Italy joined in 2000., 63342=Italy, meanwhile, started the newly christened Six Nations championship superbly in 2000, winning their opening game against Scotland in Rome, and in 2007 had their best tournament yet finishing forth with back to back wins against Scotland and Wales., 66092=War again meant the curtailment of the championship in 1940. But when it resumed in 1947 it marked the beginning of a new rugby order., 67515=France did not join the fray until 1910 and, despite their later dominance, they struggled at first to achieve any notable success. They did however, coin the phrase 'five nations'. In their first four years of entry, the French won just one game - a one point victory over Scotland in 1911., 62677=Wales put a poor world cup well and truly behind them by winning the grand slam in 2008 and not to be outdone Ireland won the grand slam in 2009 the first time since 1948. Wales hosted Ireland in Cardiff on the last round of play in 2009 with a Triple Crown on the line as well as knowing a 13-point win would be enough to retain their title. Drama ensued as with Ireland leading 17-15 at the death Welsh stand-off Stephen Jones missed a 50-metre penalty from halfway.}",

Clive Woodward's men took control when Lawrence Dallaglio crossed in the first half, and with Jonny Wilkinson providing a constant stream of points, they were always able to keep the Irish at arm's length. Will Greenwood added two more tries and further scores from MIke Tindall and Dan Luger sealed a comprehensive victory. With 48,000 fans packed inside the Dublin ground, Ireland had the first scoring chance, and David Humphreys was agonisingly close to finding the target with a monster 55-metre penalty kick. Prop Marcus Horan was the next to threaten, smashing through England\u00ff\u00a2??s defence, and although he was held up, Humphreys dropped a goal from 25 metres to give his team a richly-deserved 3-0 lead. England then struck for their first notable attack. With Ireland\u00ff\u00a2??s scrum under pressure, Matt Dawson poached possession and sprinted away, before supporting number eight Dallaglio powered over between the posts. The faultless Wilkinson converted to give England a 7-3 lead. The dangerous Geordan Murphy raced clear in acres of space and Ireland roared back, and it took a superb Wilkinson tackle to halt his progress. Wilkinson was at it again just seconds later, smashing Ireland wing Justin Bishop into the turf with another mighty tackle. Humphreys cut Ireland's deficit when he landed a 50-metre penalty - his first success from three attempts - but a Wilkinson drop-goal on 29 minutes restored England's four-point advantage. Matt Dawson, Richard Hill and Graham Rowntree all had to be treated for blood injuries as the taclkes flew in. Another Dallaglio charge took England deep into the Irish half entering injury-time, and Wilkinson sweetly struck his second drop-goal with his right foot to give the visitors a deserved 13-6 interval advantage. England dominated early possession in the second half, but suffered a setback in the 44th minute when Wilkinson required treatment for what appeared to be a left shoulder problem. He was clearly in considerable discomfort, but continued, thinking he had struck his third drop-goal just a minute later. Referee Jonathan Kaplan gave it, but play was called back after the touch judge spotted a wayward line-out throw just seconds before Wilkinson found the target. Wilkinson went off in the 54th minute, although it appeared to be for blood, rather than his shoulder, which meant a chance for experienced fly-half Paul Grayson. Ireland sent on lock Paul O'Connell as a 57th-minute replacement for Gary Longwell, but England struck with a telling blow just two minutes later. Centre Will Greenwood's pass split open the Irish defence, and his midfield colleague Tindall raced 30 metres for a crucial try. Grayson converted before Wilkinson went back on, with England leading 20-6 going into the final quarter. If the Grand Slam had been in doubt until Tindall's effort, it was put beyond all doubt when England scored their third try in the 64th minute. Ireland's defensive wall took a ferocious battering, and Greenwood emerged with the ball from underneath a forward pile, claiming the try. Wilkinson kicked the conversion. Try hero Tindall then departed with an injury, limping off, and England's subsequent midfield reorganisation saw wing Jason Robinson switch to centre, with replacement Luger going on the wing. A 70th-minute Wilkinson penalty took England 30-6 in front - and Greenwood was soon gifted his second try of the match before Luger went over in the corner in injury-time. Soon after the final whistle sounded, to the delight of Woodward and his players., 58554=80 mins: Martyn Williams kicks the ball dead to spark furious celebrations at the Millennium Stadium as Wales claim the Championship and their first Grand Slam since 1978., 74786=England and Ireland were both unbeaten when they met on Sunday March 30th 2003 to decide the 6 Nations championship., 116416=1983, 99722=1993, 81873=Last year it was Scotland; in 1999 Wales. This year Ireland completed the Celtic hat-trick to gleefully deny England the ultimate Six Nations prize., 138384=1970, 123144=1979, 111369=1986, 148512=1964, 94870=1996, 151876=1962, 58281=Mike Ruddock's side held their nerve to beat Ireland at home for the first time since 1983 and clinch the Six Nations., 128226=1976, 145148=1966, 119780=1981, 25089=Ireland ended their 61-year wait for a Grand Slam by beating Wales 17-15 in a thrilling denouement to the 2009 RBS 6 Nations. Wales fly-half Stephen Jones missed a last-minute penalty from just short of halfway which, if successfully kicked, would have denied the Irish their first clean sweep since 1948. Tries from Brian O'Driscoll and Tommy Bowe in a two-minute period just after half time ultimately served to take the game out of Wales' reach. The final results and point difference mean Wales finish fourth. England defeated fierce rivals Scotland 26-12 to win back the Calcutta Cup and clinch second spot. First-half tries from Ugo Monye and Riki Flutey handed England the upper hand, and Mathew Tait's late score ended a potential Scottish comeback. The Scots have not won a Calcutta Cup clash at Twickenham since 1983. In Rome, Italy landed the wooden spoon after a 50-8 defeat at the hands of France who finished third. Tries from S\u00e9bastien Chabal, Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc, Maxime M\u00e9dard (two), C\u00e9dric Heymans, Thomas Domingo and Julien Malzieu won Les Bleus the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy., 104641=1990, 134955=1972 (Championship not completed due to security concerns in Ireland), 101339=1992, 108005=1988, 113052=1985, 64295=1525 GMT: A strong, travelling Ireland contingent of fans belt out 'Ireland's call.' Charlotte Church and Katherine Jenkins join Max Boyce to sing the Wales anthem, before the singing of 'Bread of Heaven' rouses the fans to new heights., 58135=Wales survived some anxious moments to claim their first Grand Slam since 1978 with a historic victory in Cardiff., 109687=1987, 126544=1977, 140066=1969, 66121=France collected the grand slam in Paris as well as the 2004 RBS Six Nations title courtesy of a 24-21 win against the world champions England at Stade de France., 121462=1980}",
