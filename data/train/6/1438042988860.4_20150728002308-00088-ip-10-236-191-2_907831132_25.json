            "Everyone at Rose-Hulman feels very safe. They leave their doors open most of time because they know that no one is going to steal anything. Walking around in the middle of the night is no problem as long as you're still on campus.",
            "Studious, hard working, nerdy.",
            "Rose-Hulman is extremely expensive. The financial aid department is extremely understanding though, and will work with you to help you as much as they can. Also, the almost 100% guarantee of employment after graduation makes the price-tag more than worth it.",
            "There is good food on campus, but if you want to eat something like Chinese, you'd have to go into town.",
            "According to all the students there, Rose-Hulman requires a lot of hard work and studying to succeed. However, many students say that they feel better prepared for work or graduate school after graduation."

It's the only place where 200 backpack each with $2000 laptops and thousands more dollars of other belongings can be left unattended outside of the cafeteria. People leave their room doors open all the time and nothing is ever taken., 154959=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 134465=Hallympics is an olympics of sorts for all of the halls on campus. Freshmen versus upperclassmen in a battle of wits and brawn. There's also the Greatest Floor which is a whole 38 hours of contests to see which floor among 30 is the best. The prize? $1000 and gloating rights for the next year. Also, for your birthday, beware the lake. Many people have been thrown in thanks to the traditional 'birthday laking'. If you really don't want to do it, no one will force you, but come on. When's the next chance that a group of people are going to pick you up and pitch you into a body of water?}",

Tips for prospective students 1) Visit the campus. If you're not into the smaller campus and small student body, you'll know after visiting. Conversely, if you're not sure about what type of campus you're looking for, visiting will really help. Take AP and IB courses and really challenge yourself to prepare for the workload. Bang for the buck It's expensive, but when you think about the career placement (close to 100% within 1 year of graduating) and the return on that investment, it becomes worth it. Am enjoying being here It's important to understand that this school is not for someone",
