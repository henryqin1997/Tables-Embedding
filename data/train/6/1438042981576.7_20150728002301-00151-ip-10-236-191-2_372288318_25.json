    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34538=2008 Coaches Hot Seat Prediction:\u00a0 \u00a0 4-8, 8956=2008 SCHEDULE, 24661=One interesting story that we would like to relate is from the Fiesta Bowl from this past January, when Bill Stewart had an opportunity to coach and field a West Virginia team that was not under the influence of Rodriguez.\u00a0 We had an opportunity to see the West Virginia players up close on the sidelines in the Fiesta Bowl against Oklahoma, and they looked and acted like a totally different team from what we experienced and saw when Rodriguez was still the head coach.\u00a0 Anyone that watched the Fiesta Bowl and saw how well the West Virginia players reacted to Rodriguez's departure and their opponent in Oklahoma, certainly left that game thinking that something was going on within the WVU football program when Rodriguez was the head coach.\u00a0, 34784=Will Rich Rodriguez be back for the 2009 season?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0YES, 18363=With all that has happened since Rich Rodriguez left West Virginia for Michigan last December, it is very hard to remember what we thought of Rodriguez during his \"pre-buyout debacle\" coaching career.\u00a0 The very first time we became aware of Rich Rodriguez was when he showed up on Tommy Bowden's staff as the offensive coordinator at Tulane.\u00a0 The spread offense that Rodriguez ran with great effectiveness at Tulane, and later at Clemson under Bowden, left us with the impression of an up and coming assistant, and it was only natural that West Virginia would turn to WVU alumnus Rodriguez when Don Nehlen retired.\u00a0 What we did not realize about Rodriguez in his pre-head coaching days was the amount of influence he was having on offenses in college football, and the number of coaches that were starting to utilize his spread techniques/offense in their own football programs.\u00a0 Sometime in Rodriguez's 2nd or 3rd year at West Virginia, we started paying attention to Rodriguez, including the way he was reshaping the Mountaineer football program, the spread offense that he was running at WVU, and the recruits he was bringing to Morgantown.\u00a0 Of course, in Rodriguez's 5th year at WVU in 2005, the Mountaineer win over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl marked Rodriguez as one top young coaches in the game.\u00a0 The first time that we heard that something might be going wrong with Rodriguez at West Virginia was in 2006, when there were comments out on the street that Rodriguez might be looking to leave WVU if the right offer came along after the '06 season.\u00a0 Evidently the right offer did come along, when Alabama offered their job to Rodriguez and Rich's now infamous agent Mike Brown spent two days in Tuscaloosa negotiating a contract for Rodriguez to take the head coaching job at Alabama.\u00a0 The terms of that contract were somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.75 million a year (about a million less a year than Alabama ended up paying Saban) and the people at Alabama will tell you today that they believed that Rodriguez had accepted the job and that they had a new head coach.\u00a0 Of course, Don Nehlen and other prominent WVU alumni rallied to keep Rodriguez at West Virginia (Alabama moved onto to Nick Saban), but for some reason the problems that caused Rodriguez to get to the brink of taking the Alabama job never really went away.\u00a0 Whether it was just the $4 million dollar buyout that West Virginia insisted on (as they should have), or if there were other issues that Rodriguez was not happy about at WVU, clearly Rodriguez was distraught just after the loss in the Pittsburgh game last fall, which led to him and his agent to contact Michigan about their head coach job opening., 28110=We predict that Rich Rodriguez and Michigan will have a 4-8 record in 2008.\u00a0 Rich Rodriguez in his first game at Michigan could probably not have a tougher non-BCS out-of-conference game to open the season, with the Utah Utes traveling to the Big House for one of the most interesting games of the opening weekend.\u00a0 Utah played much better and more consistently under Whittingham in 2008, and they will bring a very good football to Ann Arbor, and we see Utah getting the win in Rodriguez's first game, which drops the Michigan record to 0-1.\u00a0 Week 2 is another tough game for Michigan with MAC conference team Miami (Ohio) traveling to Ann Arbor.\u00a0 After an opening season loss, we see Michigan playing a little better in this game to get the win over Miami (Ohio), which takes their record to 1-1.\u00a0 Week 3 is Rodriguez's first step onto the big stage, with a trip to South Bend to play Charlie Weis and the Fighting Irish.\u00a0 Notre Dame should be a better team in '08 than they were in the '07 season, and we see the Irish getting the win over Michigan, which drops the Wolverine record to 1-2.\u00a0 The Big Ten schedule gets under way in week 4 with Wisconsin visiting Ann Arbor, and Rodriguez will get an early taste of what the Big Ten is all about with the Badgers bringing their physical style of play to Ann Arbor.\u00a0 Michigan should be starting to play better by week 4, but we see Wisconsin getting the win in this game.\u00a0 After four games, Michigan is 1-3.\u00a0 The Big Ten schedule continues with Ron Zook and the Illini traveling to Ann Arbor in week 5, and this will be two spread offenses going against each other, in what will be an example of what most Big Ten teams will probably look like in the coming years.\u00a0 In a closer game than expected, we see Illinois getting the win in this game, which drops the Michigan record to 1-4.\u00a0 Another MAC team in Toledo visits Ann Arbor in week 6 and this will not be a game that Michigan will be able to let up in, and in another close game, we see Michigan getting the win, which raises their record to 2-4.\u00a0 Rich Rodriguez gets to play his first road game in the Big Ten, and boy is it a beaut with a trip to Happy Valley to play Penn State.\u00a0 With over 105,000 crazy Penn State fans and a slightly better Nittany Lion team in '08, we see Penn State getting a win in this game.\u00a0 After seven games, Michigan is 2-5.\u00a0 Mark Dantonio and Michigan State arrive in Ann Arbor in week 8 and Rodriguez has probably already learned this is not a game he will be able to lose on any kind of regular basis.\u00a0 The problem for Rodriguez is that Mark Dantonio is not going to be a walkover, and in the coming years Rodriguez might do very well to just split the series with Spartans, and unfortunately that will just not be good enough for the Michigan fans.\u00a0 Dantonio has brought a lot of stability and has changed the mindset at Michigan State in his short time there, and we believe MSU will beat UM in this game.\u00a0 After eight games, Michigan is 2-6.\u00a0 If Michigan is 2-6 after eight games, the trip to West Lafayette to play Joe Tiller and the Boilermakers in week 9 will not be something that Rodriguez will be looking forward to.\u00a0 After a Purdue commit changed his mind and signed with Michigan earlier this year, Tiller said about Rodriguez, \u201cIf we had an early signing date, you wouldn\u2019t have another outfit with a guy in a wizard hat selling snake oil get a guy at the last minute, but that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\u00a0 Now that is a hellava line, and we believe Purdue will be ready to play the Wolverines and get the win in this game.\u00a0 After nine games, Michigan is 2-7.\u00a0 In week 10 Michigan travels to Minnesota in what will be Tim Brewster's second year, and this should be a very close game between two teams that are looking to find their footing.\u00a0 We believe Michigan will get the win in this game, which raises their record to 3-7.\u00a0 In week 11 Northwestern travels to Ann Arbor and this should be another close Big Ten game with Michigan pulling away in the 2nd half to get the win.\u00a0 After 11 games, Michigan is 4-7.\u00a0 Michigan ends the season with a trip to Columbus to play the Ohio State Buckeyes, and this will be the first of several battles between Rich Rodriguez and Jim Tressel.\u00a0 Jim Tressel is 11 years older than Rodriguez, which is not all that much different than the age difference between Woody Hayes and Bo Schembechler (16 years) and there certainly is an opportunity for 10 or so games between Rodriguez and Tressel in the coming years.\u00a0 If Rich Rodriguez has the desire to win championships (if he doesn't he is coaching at the wrong place) then he is going to have to find a way to beat Jim Tressel and Ohio State a majority of the time, and Rodriguez is going to find in this first match-up with the Buckeyes just how difficult of a challenge that is going to be.\u00a0 We see Ohio State getting a couple of touchdowns win in this game, and that sends the Michigan '08 regular season record to 4-8.}",
