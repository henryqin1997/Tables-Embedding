John Harnish, Associate General Secretary, who funded this research. We especially appreciate the support of the committee that works with clergywomen\u2019s concerns, the Continuing Education for Ministry Committee, Rev. Mary Ann Moman, Chair, Rev. Lynn Scott, Staff. We also wish to acknowledge the many clergywomen who participated in this project and all other clergywomen who have embodied these issues in their lives., 16518=Other studies have investigated the experiences of clergywomen in The United Methodist Church and other denominations.\u00a0 These investigations have shown inequitable experiences between clergywomen and clergymen.\u00a0 A study of United Methodist clergywomen, sponsored by the Division of Ordained Ministry of The United Methodist Church in 1980, revealed that clergywomen experienced discontent in their interpersonal relationships with their superiors, peers, and parishioners.\u00a0 Clergywomen experienced overt discrimination, lack of acceptance, and were stereotyped into certain gender roles. In Women of the Cloth, a study of clergywomen in nine denominations, researchers found that some lay leaders in the study had a difficult time reconciling the images of minister and woman.\u00a0 This type of conflict may make it difficult for clergywomen to succeed in their churches., 14973=Women\u2019s ordination has a long history in the traditions comprising The United Methodist Church.\u00a0 The United Brethren Church approved the ordination of women in 1889.\u00a0 The Evangelical Church was opposed to the ordination of women, however.\u00a0 When those churches united, the new church, The Evangelical United Brethren [EUB] Church, did not continue the practice of ordaining women.\u00a0 The Methodist Church did not approve women until 1956, though ordination as \u201clocal elders\u201d was allowed much earlier.\u00a0 In 1968, the Evangelical United Brethren Church and the Methodist Church merged, at which time full clergy status was continued for women. Currently, The Book of Discipline states, \u201cBoth men and women are included in all provisions of the Discipline that refer to the ordained ministry.\u201d\u00a0 Additionally, The United Methodist Church, in its Social Principles, supports the rights of women:, 102858=According to the 1996 Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church, the district superintendency is supposed to be the space where clergy can go to receive guidance and counsel when needed.\u00a0 Several of the specific responsibilities assigned to district superintendents as outlined in the Book of Discipline provide provisions for such support:, 284345=A total of 2796 current and former clergywomen received the invitation packets; non-receipt was due to incorrect address and inability to forward.\u00a0 A total of 1388 completed questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 49.64%.\u00a0 The self-selected sample of 1388 clergywomen was included in the questionnaire analysis.}",

Some additional studies that may aid the Church in its attempt to retain its clergywomen should be considered.\u00a0 Exploring specific means of training cabinets, other clergy, and congregations in being more sensitive to the needs of clergywomen would help in the development of an education initiative which could lead to a more clergywomen-friendly Church.\u00a0 Examination of seminaries and the preparation they provide future clergy would also result in some vital information leading to the implementation of some interventions in the seminaries to help prepare clergywomen specifically for local church ministry.\u00a0 A comparative study on clergymen and their experiences within",
