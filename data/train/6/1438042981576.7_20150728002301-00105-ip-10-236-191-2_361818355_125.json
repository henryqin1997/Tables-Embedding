RPR and SSO need to be configured by the user, however, because a second Cisco IOS process is not available by default on Cisco ASR 1002 and 1004 routers. Enter the redundancy command in global configuration mode to enter redundancy configuration mode. You can enter the mode command within redundancy configuration mode., 314869=For all other ports: from 1500 to 9216 bytes, 238385=The following example configures ATM mode on controller T1 1/ 0 on a Cisco 2600 series router using an AIM in slot 0 for ATM segmentation and reassembly:, 349657=The negotiationcommand is applicable to the Gigabit Ethernet interface of the Cisco 7200-I/O-GE+E and interfaces on the 2-port 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet SPA that are using fiber media. The negotiationautocommand is used instead of the duplex and speed commands (which are used on Ethernet and Fast Ethernet interfaces, and interfaces on the 2-port 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet SPA that are using RJ-45 media) to automatically configure the duplex and speed settings of the interfaces.}",
