Usage Guidelines Use the match command to check for the attribute to be present in the packet. The vendor-type and ven-type-number keyword-argument pair specifies the attributes associated with a specific vendor. If no attribute is specified, the condition matches the filter for any attribute of the specific vendor: Examples The following example shows how to enter the RADIUS filter configuration mode and configure a match attribute and a vendor type.
