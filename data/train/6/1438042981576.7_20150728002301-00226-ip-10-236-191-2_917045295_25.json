            "the campus safety is very low. we have plenty of cops and they are not seen alot. lately since the shooting they have been out.",
            "this campus is full of greek life and very exciting!",
            "tsu is known as a party school. there are many parties off campus to attend. not much on campus is fun except for the school activities, but nashville has alot of places to go.",
            "the food is the same. i say we eat chicken atleast three times a week. not much variety, especially for a vegetarian.",
            "the dorms are horrible. tsu should really get money to make the dorms better.",
            "classes are not too tough but they are a bit challenging.",
            "for future students i'd say stay away from the crowd, and join clubs. find something you can enjoy that can keep you occupied and away from the bad crowd.",
            "tsu is a great school and has alot of oppritunities for their students. i can truely say tsu cares for the students, its just a matter of them caring for themselves. this school is always credited for its bad things but it is a great school and has many great aspects."

It's much better being at the guys or honors dorms all day., 371329=I lived in the doors in 2008 when I came in as a Freshman. I was already used to working several hours, so my dorm life was not as much as I know it could have being that I worked and attended school at the same time. I now live off campus and if that is what you decide to do, determination will be your main drive., 380828=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 13951=This school of choice I visited in April on a black college tour with joblink., 370847=Being that I worked in a restaurant, I normally had food from there. Yet, when I did eat on campus, our meals were great and now I understand that meals are healthier than what they were in 2008., 34059=The dorm rooms are not the best at TSU. However, they plan to build a new dorm by the year 2014. Hale, Rudolph and the on campus apartments are the best living spots.}",
