Tips for prospective students Don't fall behind, come on if you're in college just keep going until you get to your goal. Bang for the buck Tuition is decent, no complains. Am enjoying being here I enjoy the ambient from this school. People are very nice and sociable, also it's not hard to get around the school. Am learning a lot All the teachers focus on each individual student. I you have any questions or concerns each teacher is attentive to give you an answer right away. Classrooms are quite small but that's the best part because teachers pay attention to you.",
