On 20 October, the enemy launched a campaign to occupy the Leyte Gulf area. At this juncture, our fleet, although not fully recovered from the damage sustained in the \"A-GO\" Operations, and consequently unprepared for a decisive battle, launched a desperate assault upon the enemy with its entire forces. Because of the enemy's air supremacy, however, our fleet was dealt a near fatal blow in this engagement.

On the same day, the Naval Combined Air Training Command was reorganized into the Tenth Air Fleet and incorporated into the Combined Fleet. Because of the acute shortage of aircraft, as well as fuel, at that time, priority was given to the training of special attack units and training of flight personnel, in general, had to be temporarily suspended. With preliminary training and preparations for converting training aircraft into special attack planes gener-, 132115=15 Aug, 46713=Second Phase: The enemy landed on Okinawa in late March 1945 and as hostile attacks against the Japanese mainland became imminent with the unfavorable conclusion of operations in this area in late June, a speedy completion of preparations for the decisive battle on the mainland became imperative. It was estimated at that time that the enemy invasion of the mainland, anticipated about September at the earliest, would be directed against the southwestern part of Japan proper and that the first wave of the enemy invasion forces would comprise approximately 10 divisions carried by 1,000 transports. It was also estimated that if army and naval, 465792=Production of Vessels During the First Half of Fiscal Year 1945 (For Escort, Transportation and Traffic Interruption Warfare), 23553=In February 1944, just as several defensive projects, based on the national policy as agreed at the Conference in September 1943, were being put into effect, United States forces, which had already occupied the Marshalls area, launched an all-out air attack against Truk. Next, during the latter part of March and early April, they launched large scale air attacks against the Palau area. Simultaneously, they occupied the northern coast of New Guinea and continued their advance. In the latter part of May they succeeded in seizing Biak Island. Subsequently, on 9 June, they launched operations to occupy Saipan., 530336=Including 2880 guns scheduled for delivery to the Army, 454906=Quantity of Land Combat Weapons to be Produced During the First Half of Fiscal Year 1945 (Cont'd), 12077=The intensification of war preparations at the front, which was conducted on the basis of the conference in the Imperial Presence on 30 September, was primarily aimed at training and replenishing the fleet and strengthening defensive power in key areas. However, the fleet training did not progress satisfactorily because the greater part of our air strength had to be diverted to the Solomons and New Guinea areas to fight battles of attrition aimed at slowing the enemy's advance. In early February 1944, the Marshall Islands were occupied by the enemy. This meant that our key areas were directly threatened by the enemy. On 17 February, Truk Island, the anchorage of the main force of our fleet, was subjected to a formidable air raid by an enemy task force. This forced the greater part of our surface units to retreat toward Palau,, 100908=30 x 600 . . . completed at the end of July., 15173=December 1943, 24916=the middle of September.

The location of the established bases at that time was as follows:, 26845=three demolition tube heroes (Nikudan-Sanyushi) in the Chine Incident and the midget submarines employed at Pearl Harbor, all possessed some features of special attack tactics. There are also many instances in the history of Japan in which men voluntarily acted in a manner similar to a special attack mission, but these acts were not specifically ordered by their superiors. The attacks carried out by the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit and the Type A Midget Submarine Unit (Cebu) during the operations in the Philippines area, during and after October 19143, were probably the first attack missions that were planned and ordered by competent commanders. The results achieved by these special attack units were unexpectedly good in comparison to the small force committed. However, it was felt that it was a great tragedy that Japanese field commanders were forced to resort to such tactics because of the rapidly deteriorating situation resulting from the enormous difference in fighting power between the Japanese and Allied forces., 43646=ally reaching completion in the middle of May, the 11th Air Flotilla, whose strength was approximately half that of the Tenth Air Fleet, and one-half of the 13th Air Flotilla resumed training., 409205=The war preparations of the Army and the Navy for the first half of the fiscal year 1945 will be accomplished in accordance with the following principles:, 110821=Emergency runway: generally completed on 15 July, 473109=Antiaircraft Equipment to be Produced in the First Half of 1945 Fiscal Year, 387217=2.\u00a0Since records for months other than April, May and June of 1945 are not available, nothing definite is known., 6662=Location of Special Attack Bases, 15 August 1945, 159639=Jan, 295906=Aircraft Produced January 1944 - August 1945 (Cont'd), 125693=Jul, 473897=1160 (210,000 rounds), 57665=724th Air Group (1 July 1945), 14719=December 1942, 128317=17 Jul, 116606=Middle of August, 72458=Nov, 160379=Nov, 408702=Agreement Between the Army and the Navy Concerning War Preparations for the First Half of Fiscal Year 1945, 15629=December 1944, 488570=Data: 6 April 1945, 402093=1944 Jan, 239690=Mar, 14271=December 1941, 118743=Middle of November, 141647=April, 61778=721st Air Group (1 Oct 1944), 511382=From Oct 1945 to End of Mar 1946, 158170=Naval Craft Completed After January 1944 (Number and Displacement), 47453=air forces could succeed in sinking half of the transports within the first ten days of the landing, the enemy's attempt could be smashed.

In view of the nature of the above bases, attention was paid to camouflage from the time of construction. They were maintained by taking special precautionary measures, such as leaving houses and trees in the secret bases intact until the air units advanced to the bases. The location of the secret bases known as pasture ground was as shown on Chart 6.

Relative to aircraft to be employed in attacking enemy invasion forces, plans will be drawn up to convert most of the aircraft used in training and those presently in storage into Special attack planes by late April. At the same time, efforts will be made to accelerate production of small special attack, 141845=June, 116928=Middle of September, 72256=Aug, 72055=May, 526546=To be completed by the end of June.

Measures to increase the effectiveness of the special attack planes: Special attack planes were used for the first time in the Philippines in 25 October 1944. They produced not only psychological effects, but also actually inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. This, 7966=At the time the War Preparations Plan, Phase Three, was being deliberated, the situation in the Solomons-New Guinea area was rapidly deteriorating. The tremendous amount of equipment able to be produced by the United States as compared with that produced by Japan was having its effect. Taking into consideration her national resources and scientific technical capacity, Japan recognized that it would be impossible to hold her own-on her greatly extended fronts. It was, therefore, decided at a council meeting held in the presence of the Emperor on 30 September 1943, to contract and consolidate the strategic areas at all costs., 100987=60 x 1,200 . . . completed at the end of August., 125619=Jun, 160305=Oct, 413652=Minimum requirements proportionate to Army and Navy strength estimated for September 1945., 31645=In the meantime not only did Iwo Jima fall in late February and the Okinawa Invasion Operation begin in early April, but the Homeland was also subjected to large scale day and night air attacks, which occurred almost continuously after the beginning of March. This resulted in heavy damage to personnel and equipment and gravely threatened communications with China and Korea. As a result, the nation's resources, war potential and productivity began to show a rapid decline., 158622=1944, 71793=(20 June 1945, First Section, General affairs Bureau, Aeronautical Department), 238216=Jan, 511217=From July to September 1945, 72525=Dec, 8634=The main points decided by the Council, in the presence of the Emperor, were that, by the middle of 1944, strategic preparations would be completed to cope with the Anglo-American offensive; the areas to be held at all costs in the Pacific and Indian Oceans were the Kurile Islands, the Bonin, Mariana and Caroline Islands, western New Guinea, Sunda and Burma, and every effort was to be made to maintain sea communications with these areas., 125841=Sep, 236381=Transports and Freighters Completed After January 1944, 159713=Feb, 159787=Mar, 406005=1945 Jan, 29765=In February 1945, the outcome of the Philippines campaign had been decided and, by the end of the same month, the supposedly impregnable fortress of Iwo Jima had been lost after furious fighting. It became increasingly clear that the enemy was about to launch large scale air raids against the Japanese Homeland. Under the circumstances, as were forced to concentrate our war preparations on the production of aircraft and special attack weapons and the completion of defenses for the decisive battle for the Homeland. In view of this situation, the Japanese, 22313=Despite these efforts, the rapid decline of Japan's national power and industrial potential could not be halted. The main reasons for this were that the implementation of the decisions cams too late; the else of the defensive sphere was too great for Japan's national and war potential; United States forces were driving westward with overwhelming strength through the Mariana and New Guinea areas, making lightening advances, and Japan's surface supply lines were under increasing pressure. This was especially true after the middle of 1943, when communications between the Southern Region and Japan proper were seriously menaced through lack of air supremacy in the Mariana, Caroline and Philippine areas., 28693=In October 1943, as a result of negotiations between the Navy Ministry and the Naval General Staff, the following agreement was reached:, 10180=As stated in Monograph 172, the Navy had embarked upon the Revised Fifth Naval Armament Expansion Program. This called for the nation, as a whole, to muster its entire power in order to attain the production goal set forth by the \"Joint Army-Navy Study in regard to the Material Mobilisation Plan for 1943.\" During the second half of 1943 and the first half of 1944, although production failed to reach the goal set forth in the Revised Fifth Plan, great advances were made, and production reached a peak unprecedented in Japan's history. Had the American invasion of the Marianas, Carolines and Philippines been delayed approximately six months, the implements of war produced by this greatly stepped-up productive effort would have had a marked effect on the war effort., 115752=(Yokosuka Naval District Top Secret Operational Order No 496, 20 May 1945)}",
