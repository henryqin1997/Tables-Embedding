He\u0092s moved around organizations and areas which I think is unusual. It seems like most scouts stick to the same area even as they move from organization to organization. Petersen went from a Texas scout with Seattle to a Midwest scout with Baltimore to a California scout with the Cubs. I have a record of a lot of players that he signed, but no particular successes. He joined the Sox as West Crosschecker in 2005., 549558=Posted 26 June 2007 - 10:53 AM, 219688=Posted 25 June 2007 - 10:38 PM, 544105=Posted 26 June 2007 - 08:52 AM, 381114=Posted 25 June 2007 - 10:54 PM, 12841=Posted 25 June 2007 - 10:34 PM, 546918=Posted 26 June 2007 - 10:46 AM}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Table McLeod is, I think, quite young to be a scouting director. He washed out of minor league baseball in the early 1990s and worked his way up from an intern position through various jobs of increasing responsibility in the Padres player development department. His only official scouting job was as a California area scout in 2002-2003. Jason McLeod \u0096 Director of Amateur Scouting, 2005-2007 In this post we\u0092ll look at the Sox scouts who are responsible for the Sox 2007 draft. I\u0092ll go through the Sox scouting director and crosscheckers, link an area scout with each drafted player and then run through each scout by the importance of players drafted this year and I\u0092ll include a signing table (if I\u0092ve got one) for every scout. Every scouting report about these recently drafted kids includes the anonymous opinions of some scout or another. But very little is known about any specific scout including the scout who will be credited signing the kid. Over the last year or so I\u0092ve been interested in seeing if building a database of players signed by specific scouts over the years could help shed light on the quality of specific scouts. Unfortunately, I\u0092m not convinced the answer is \u0093yes\u0094, but it\u0092s been interesting nonetheless. Posted 25 June 2007 - 10:34 PM",
