Mackay, Ii, Largo, FL US Patent application number Description Published 20090326435 Systems and methods for treating superficial venous malformations like varicose or spider veins - Systems and methods treat superficial venous malformations, such as varicose or spider veins. The systems and methods distribute a reactive agent, e.g., a light-reactive agent such as talaporfin sodium or verteporfin, at or near an inner wall of a superficial feeder vein leading to the varicose or spider veins. The systems and methods activate the reactive agent by applying energy, e.g. non-thermal light energy at a wavelength that activates the reactive agent to cause localized injury to the inner wall of the superficial feeder vein to close the feeder vein to interrupt blood flow to the varicose or spider veins, which consequently shrink. 12-31-2009 20100210995 SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR TREATING SUPERFICIAL VENOUS MALFORMATIONS LIKE SPIDER VEINS - Systems and methods treat superficial venous malformations, such as spider veins.
