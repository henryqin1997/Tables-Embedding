    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{24778=For First Contact, John Eaves used the 1994 Playmates USS Enterprise-B toy (no. 6172), the only refit-Excelsior-class model commercially available at the time, to construct the golden display models of the ships seen in the display case in the observation lounge of the USS Enterprise-E. He filled one of them up with solid resin, made castings from it for additional copies, and had them all gold-plated. [4] The models seen in their later reappearance in Star Trek Nemesis were constructed from the by-then available AMT model kits of the refit-class., 40345=Deep Space Nine debuted in 1994 followed by more Playmates TNG characters and a toy line for the feature film, Star Trek Generations. Voyager figures arrived in 1995, as did more TOS, TNG, and DS9 items. By 1996, the separate lines were all consolidated under a single \"Star Trek\" banner, excepting releases that were based on Star Trek: First Contact and Star Trek: Insurrection., 41597=The line was launched in the fall of 1992 with a series of action figures based on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Nearly the entire USS Enterprise-D crew was represented, plus Gowron, a Ferengi, a Borg, and a Romulan. Role-playing items included a type 2 phaser and communicator, while a shuttlecraft was produced for the figures. A model of the Enterprise-D was also released. The line was quite successful, and another wave of TNG figures, accessories, and vehicles was produced in the fall of 1993 along with a special boxed set of all seven of the Original Series' major crew members., 22076=In \"Dark Frontier\", the young Annika Hansen character sometimes played with a model of a Borg cube that belonged to her father. This model was actually a modified 1994 Playmates Borg cube (No. 6158)., 38372=However, the license's popularity had begun to decline by 1998. By 1999, the number of items produced by Playmates had dwindled with limited releases being offered exclusively through individual retailers. On 17 September 1999, Playmates' Star Trek lines were formally canceled., 39322=In 1995, Playmates' video game division called Playmates Interactive Entertainment released Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Crossroads of Time for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System platforms., 25681=In one of the concept illustrations for the Borg sphere dated January 1996, and designed for Star Trek: First Contact, John Eaves hid the names of his wife Diane and his two daughters, Olivia and Alicia, among the extremely intricate outer details. He added, \"What's funny about this is that Playmates put out a toy Borg sphere which just happens to contain the first initial of everyone's name.\" (Star Trek: The Next Generation Sketchbook: The Movies, pp. 205 & 215), 38070=In January 2008, it was reported that Playmates would be creating a toy line for J.J. Abrams' Star Trek. [2] This new line of figures, vehicles, and role-playing items was launched in April 2009. A second wave was planned for release in late 2009 but was later pushed back to spring 2010 before the releases were canceled and Playmates' Star Trek licensing was concluded. The company cited disappointing sales as the cause for the termination of their licensing agreement. [3], 21523=Ezri Dax was the only main cast member (from the four spinoff series made during Playmates' licensing of Star Trek) not to receive an action figure from the company. Diamond Select Toys released an Ezri figure in late 2007.}",

Star Trek: The Next Generation, 4.5 inch figures, Assortment No. 6010 Edit 1992 releases Edit Playmates Star Trek releasesEdit The documentary reality series FanAddicts! was a television series that explored fans of motion picture franchises, those in the science fiction, horror and fantasy genres in particular, and their obsession with collecting memorabilia of said genre productions. In the 2013 episode \"Star Trek\" (Season 1, episode 3), American collector Mark, owning a huge Star Trek memorabilia merchandise collection, went into detail about the production errors of several Star Trek Playmates action figures, revealing that people collecting these are known in collector circles as \"variant collectors\". \"The Russian Rocket Reaction\" (Season 5, episode 5): In this episode, Brent Spiner (as himself) thoughtlessly ripped open a signed first edition Wesley Crusher Playmates action figure (alluded to as the 1993 edition No. 6021) which Wil Wheaton (as himself) had just given to Sheldon",
