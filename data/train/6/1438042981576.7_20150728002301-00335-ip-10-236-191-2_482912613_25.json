The display or recording is typically. connected to one relative humidity sensor and specifically Communication Software - Key to Improving Thermal Control Systems system consists of four basic components, which are joined in the form of a closed-loop system. The four elements include: * Heater or cooler - This provides the heating or cooling energy to the system. * Sensor - Measures the temperature or other process variables (i.e. humidity, pressure, etc Energy-stingy coolers . But AZFlow coolers are said to be scale-free and maintain efficiencies of 85 to 90% after several years of service. The system measures ambient air temperature, humidity, and airflow using sensors that connect to the processor via analog I/O modules residing on a Snap rack.
