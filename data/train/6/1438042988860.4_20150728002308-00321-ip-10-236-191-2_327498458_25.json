Perhaps Rosenbaum's system was over-parametrized since he had relatively few data points. Did he run the regression over all 420 players with >250 minutes? He has results for 420 players. His notes stated that \"The regression is weighted by minutes played with the 2003-04 season counting twice as much as the 2002-03 season.\" That adds even more error to the regression., 231751=16.

For example: when the Spurs beat the Cavs in Game 1 of the 2007 NBA Finals, the two teams fielded these lineups: Where homecourt = 1 if the team is at home and 0 if they're on the road. So an example of this would be the game last night between the Nuggets and the Heat -- Denver had an SRS of 4.46, Miami had an SRS of 0.71, and the Nuggets were the home team (homecourt = 1), so I estimated their probability of winning as 0.778 . xWP = 1 / (1 + exp(0.622 - 0.168(tm_srs) + 0.168(opp_srs) - 1.244(homecourt))) Here's the method: I took the updated SPM formula (the regression for which which I ran a month ago, dumping some of those insignificant variables and getting back to Prof. Rosenbaum's original model), and instead of fitting it to team efficiency differential, I made it sum to each team's Simple Rating, which takes into account strength of schedule. I did this because we can calculate an expected winning % for each team in a game, given their SRS, their opponent's SRS, and the location of the game. In fact, you can use the",
    "textAfterTable": "Beno Udrih SAS 0 -4.05 That distribution of minutes gave San Antonio an SRS of 10.97 and Cleveland a 5.66 mark; using the equation above, you find that teams playing at home with an SRS of 10.97 vs. an opponent of 5.66 tend to win 82.0% of the time (and San Antonio did win, 85-76). For this game, I'm giving the Spurs +0.18 \"credit\" for the victory, or (1 - 0.82), the amount by which they exceeded their expected win probability by actually winning the game. Teams that are favored will obviously never get more than 0.5 \"credits\" in a game, since they're always expected to win more than half of the time. But teams that pull off huge upsets will receive large amounts of credit -- in the Cavs-Spurs example, had Cleveland managed to win they would have exceeded their win expectancy by 0.82 (100% - 18%), and would have gotten that credit for the improbable win. And that's the basis for this list. For every game I calculated what percentage of the time a certain outcome \"should\" have happened given the location of the game and the players on the court. Here are the games in which the outcome contradicted that prediction by the greatest amount: 50. April 30, 1995: Hornets 106, Bulls 89 (Bulls xW% = 81.0%) Player",
