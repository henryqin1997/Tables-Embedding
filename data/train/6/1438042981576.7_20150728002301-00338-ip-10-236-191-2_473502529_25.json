The Company owns and intends to operate the mobile electron beam particle accelerator unit installed in a semi-tractor trailer, which it plans to use for the commencement of operations and making sales presentations to prospective customers throughout the United States, and to other countries., 40656=The Company has commenced business operations and generated minimal revenues. The Company has a specific business plan and is seeking the funds to execute its business plan. The Company does not consider itself to be a blank check company as defined in Rule 419 of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933. \u00a0It is aggressively pursuing its business plan given the current financial status of the Company and the fact that the Board of Directors is active and supportive of the plan. The Company was acquired for the purpose of executing a specific business plan developed by its founder, Charles J. Scimeca, as set forth in the prospectus. \u00a0The Company is moving forward with development as defined in its business development objectives. \u00a0Based upon the above, the Company believes it is not within the scope of Rule 419., 113824=For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, our total gross profit increased by $3,235 or 369.7% to $4,110 from $875 in 2011. \u00a0As a percent of sales, gross profit decreased to 51.5% in 2012 as compared to 58.3% in 2011. \u00a0The decrease is attributable to product costs., 117555=The Company\u0092s cost of revenue was $3,869 for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $4,494 for the period from inception to December 31, 2012., 441023=In conjunction with the Private Placement Memorandum dated October 28, 2011, the Company is offering up to 10,000 Units. \u00a0Each Unit consists of 1,000 shares of common stock priced at $0.50 per share and one Class A Warrant to purchase 1,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.00 per share. \u00a0These warrants expire on the earlier of (i) 180 days after the common stock commences quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board or (ii) one year after the date of issuance., 588493=Promissory Note between the Company and Joe-Val, Inc., dated March 27, 2012, 568603=During June 2012, the Company borrowed $125,000 from an affiliate. \u00a0The loan bears interest at 10% per annum and is unsecured and payable upon demand. \u00a0The Company has paid $36,120 towards the loan amount. \u00a0The outstanding balance as of December 31, 2012 is $88,880., 470749=The balance sheet caption derivative liability consists of derivative features embedded in convertible debentures including the conversion feature and warrants which have anti-dilution protections. \u00a0These derivative financial instruments are indexed to an aggregate of 800,000 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock as of December 31, 2012 and are carried at fair value. \u00a0The balance at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $276,000 and $0, respectively., 591046=Filed with the SEC on November 29, 2012 as part of the Company\u0092s S-1/A., 462492=Fair Value at December 31, 2012, 73676=In the United States the Environmental Protection Agency (\u0093EPA\u0094) 2009 National Public Water Systems Compliance Report, states that there were over 150,000 public rural water districts in the United States serving over 300 million users. The majority of these are considered very small, small and medium-sized public water systems, which support populations of fewer than 10,000 people. Small systems comprise the vast majority of all systems. Noncompliance occurs more frequently at smaller systems often because they may have fewer resources to operate and maintain compliance. This problem is expected to worsen as more stringent EPA rules are implemented for small public water systems. Approximately 28 percent of all systems in the U.S. had at least one significant violation reported in 2009. This rate is comparable to those reported in previous years. The data submitted by primacy agencies indicate that 7 percent of all public water systems in the U.S., serving approximately 17,693,000 users, had violations of health-based standards in 2009. \u00a0In 2009, about 18 percent of all public water systems had significant monitoring and reporting violations. Substantial expenditures will be needed in the coming years for repair, rehabilitation, operation, and maintenance of the water and wastewater treatment infrastructure. Management believes that water districts using conventional treatment methods will be unable to comply with the EPA\u0092s Safe Drinking Water Act (\u0093SDWA\u0094) without massive installations of on-site chemical filter aids and disinfection equipment., 161161=December 31,, 114349=General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of consulting fees, rent, travel, meals and entertainment, and preparing reports and SEC filings relating to being a public company. \u00a0For the year ended December 31, 2012, general and administrative expenses increased to $681,875 from $228,713 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 representing an increase of $453,162 or 198.1%. \u00a0The increase is primarily attributable to increases in advertising and marketing costs, consulting fees and officer compensation fees in the amounts of $72,627, $190,895, $120,000, respectively. \u00a0These increases are the result of the Company growing its business., 99684=As of April 16, 2013, there were 117,263,000 shares of the registrant\u0092s $0.001 par value common stock issued and outstanding and were owned by approximately 40 holders of record, based on information provided by our transfer agent., 599228=Dated: April 16, 2013, 441599=Warrants to purchase up to1,030,000 shares of common stock were issued in accordance with the Private Placement Memorandum stated above. \u00a0Of these issuances, warrants to purchase up to 236,000 shares of common stock expired during 2012. \u00a0Warrants to purchase up to 794,000 shares of common stock remain outstanding at December 31, 2012. \u00a0As these warrants were issued as part of a unit sold, there has been no value assigned to them., 401295=Research and development costs, which relate primarily to the development, design and testing of products, are expensed as incurred. \u00a0Such costs were approximately $7,700 and $18,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively., 431157=Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $4,081 and $4,103, respectively., 61649=At the execution of the Third Amendment, Renu\u00e9ll shall now have a worldwide exclusive contract for an initial period of five (5) years and two (2) five (5) year possible extensions that are available upon meeting Exhibit B quota requirements. Renu\u00e9ll shall also deposit Fifty Thousand dollars ($50,000) which will be applied first to the down payment of any purchase order that Renu\u00e9ll shall make. \u00a0On or before January 15, 2013, or upon the successful completion of stability testing of newly developed shampoo and approval by testing authority, whichever occurs later, Renu\u00e9ll shall place a purchase order for 100,000 Duo-Packs (which consist of 100,000 .5 Oz units and 100,000 units for 100,000 10oz shampoo) or any order for any product that equates to the same dollar amount. The stability testing will comprise of ingredient consistency testing for the shampoo product to ensure that all the ingredients are compatible; this testing will be performed by LaDove Labs, Inc., which is located in Hialeah, Florida. The purchase order requires a 50% down payment, which was paid in December 2012., 112852=The Company\u0092s revenues were $7,979 for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $1,500 in 2011. \u00a0This represents an increase of $6,479 or 431.9%. \u00a0The increase is directly attributable to the Company starting to commence marketing for its product., 8178=San Diego, CA 92106, 487869=As of December 31, 2012, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards for income purposes of approximately $370,383 that may be offset against future taxable income. \u00a0The net operating loss carry-forwards expire through the year 2033. \u00a0Current tax laws limit the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs or a change in the nature of the business. \u00a0Therefore, the amount available to offset future taxable income may be limited., 504334=April 12, 2010, 154395=The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed further in Note 1, the Company has been in the development stage since its inception (October 14, 2009) and continues to incur significant losses. The Company's viability is dependent upon its ability to obtain future financing and the success of its future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty., 557957=Mr. Stickler was appointed as Vice President and Director on May 18, 2012, and is not compensated as a director., 438805=On October 20, 2011, the Company issued 101,800,000 shares of its common stock as payment for cancellation of debt for part of the amount due to its related party., 99089=As of April 16, 2013, there is no public market for our Common Stock. We intend to contact an authorized OTC Bulletin Board market-maker for sponsorship of our securities on the OTC Bulletin Board., 121420=As of December 31, 2012, total current assets were $299,919, which consisted primarily of cash, inventory and deposits., 466928=Balance as of January 1, 2011, 585159=Filed with the SEC on April 18, 2011 as part of the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K., 494014=In connection with the preparation of our annual report as of December 31, 2012, the Company\u0092s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2012. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2012, as a result of the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as discussed below., 590563=Filed with the SEC on January 17, 2013 as part of the Company\u0092s S-1/A..., 444728=Outstanding, December 31, 2010, 418998=2012, 119978=Net loss for the period October 14, 2009 (inception) through December 31, 2012 was $(1,089,363). The net loss for this period was primarily related to general and administrative expenses exceeding the amount of revenues for the period indicated., 584636=Filed with the SEC on January 19, 2010 as part of the Company\u0092s Registration of Securities on Form 10-12G., 489793=During June 2012, the Company borrowed $125,000 from an affiliate. \u00a0The loan bears interest at 10% per annum and is unsecured and payable upon demand. \u00a0The Company has paid $36,120 towards the loan amount. \u00a0The outstanding balance as of December 31, 2012 is $88,880., 96222=We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item., 398126=2016, 569487=$1,729 for each month of use and is payable in arrears. \u00a0For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded expense of approximately $10,400 and $0.00, respectively. \u00a0No amounts were due at December 31, 2012 or 2011., 54956=On December 29, 2011, and then Amended on January 23, 2012, May 7, 2012 and December 13, 2012, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Renu\u00e9ll Int\u0092l Inc., a Florida corporation (\u0093Renu\u00e9ll\u0094) entered into that certain distribution agreement (the \u0093Distribution Agreement\u0094) with Regenetech, Inc., a Texas corporation (\u0093RGT\u0094), see section \u0093Distribution Agreement\u0094 for further details of the agreement. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Distribution Agreement, Renu\u00e9ll shall act as an exclusive distributor for a series of cosmetics created in a rotatable perfused time varying electromagnetic force bioreactor developed, manufactured and sold by RGT., 495607=A material weakness is a control deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard No. 5) or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. \u00a0Management has identified the following four material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that, as of December 31, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective at the reasonable assurance level:, 416047=During August 2012, the Company entered into a two-year commission agreement whereby it will pay a $35 commission for each product sold. \u00a0The agreement will automatically renew in one-year increments unless cancelled in writing sixty-days prior to expiration., 422870=Machinery and equipment, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, consisted of the following:, 8106=1220 Rosecrans Street, PMB 258, 152040=We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Technology Applications International Corporation and Subsidiaries (a development stage enterprise)(the \u0093Company\u0094) as of December 31, 2011 and the related statements of operations, shareholders\u0092 equity/(deficit), and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2011, and for the period from October 14, 2009 (inception) through December 31, 2011.
