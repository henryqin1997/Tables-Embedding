While batting average is only one way for us to measure a player or team's effectiveness at the plate, with so many lineups looking mediocre, it makes ranking MLB lineups difficult., 265643=The power the Tigers lost has been replaced with players who hit to contact and have above-average speed once they get on base. Detroit's contact rate has risen from 78 percent in 2013 to 81.7 percent, and the team has already stolen more bases (36) than it did all of last season (35)., 186473=While the Washington Nationals ranked seventh in baseball with 299 runs scored over the second half of the 2013 season, the team struggled to hit with runners in scoring position, bating a meager .245, the ninth-worst mark in the game., 265289=The Tigers are averaging 4.89 runs per game this season after averaging 4.91 runs in 2013, despite the offensive firepower they lost in the offseason. But the 2013 Tigers were shut out 12 times. The 2014 Tigers have been shut out just once. They are on pace to be shut out just four or five times., 159581=The St. Louis Cardinlas not only excelled at hitting with runners in scoring position in 2013 (a MLB-best .330/.402/.463 slash line), but they posted the third-highest team on-base percentage (.332)\u2014tops in the National League., 135943=The team's lone All-Star representative last season, Jason Castro (pictured), has regressed as expected. His unsustainable .359 BABIP in 2013 has dropped to a .299 mark, resulting in an equal drop in his batting average (.276 to .217)., 141823=The Cincinnati Reds were having enough trouble scoring runs before Jay Bruce (pictured) went down with an injured knee that's expected to keep him out of action until June at the earliest., 217090=After outscoring the rest of baseball by nearly 60 runs a season ago, the Boston Red Sox's offense has taken a step back in 2014.\u00a0Some regression was expected, of course, given that the team needed to replace Stephen Drew and Jacoby Ellsbury., 199865=As was the case in 2013, injuries have hit the heart of Milwaukee Brewers lineup, with Ryan Braun spending time on the disabled list earlier this season and Aramis Ramirez currently sidelined., 315107=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Bleacher Report, Inc.

Unlike our\u00a0Opening Day rankings, which were based on history, expectations for the upcoming season and what we saw in spring training, these updated rankings are based solely on a team's production so far. But we're going to give it a shot. A downturn in offensive production, which began in 2010, continues, with major leaguers hitting only .250 through games as of",

Everth Cabrera has forgotten how to get on base, where he can use his elite speed and baserunning skills to cause havoc for the opposition. That's left the likes of Chase Headley, Jedd Gyorko and Will Venable with fewer run-producing opportunities\u2014never a good thing. Of course, it would help if the aforementioned trio of run producers were hitting above the Mendoza Line, which they're not, with a combined .177 batting average. The recent return to action for oft-injured outfielders Cameron Maybin and Carlos Quentin should help, but neither one can be counted on to stay healthy for any length of time. Factoring them in to the equation is only setting yourself up for disappointment if you're one of the Friars' faithful.",
