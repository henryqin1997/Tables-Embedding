    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{89729=Other Contingencies Representations and Warranties As part of the FDIC\u0092s efforts to maximize the return from the sale of assets from bank resolutions, representations and warranties, and guarantees were offered on loan sales. The total amount of loans sold subject to representations and warranties, and guarantees were $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2001. The estimated losses for the contingent liability from all outstanding claims asserted in connection with representations and warranties was $1.5 million at December 31, 2001., 93377=The DIFA provided, among other things, for the elimination of the mandatory minimum assessment formerly provided for in the FDI Act. It also provided for the expansion of the assessment base for payments of the interest on obligations issued by the FICO to include all FDIC-insured institutions (including banks, thrifts, and Oakar and Sasser financial institutions), and it made the FICO assessment separate from regular assessments, effective on January 1, 1997., 112218=Financial instruments that potentially subject the BIF to credit risk consist primarily of gross receivables from bank resolutions totaling $5.4 billion. The receivables from bank resolutions include payments made to cover obligations to insured depositors, advances to receiverships to provide working capital, and receivables for expenses paid by the BIF on behalf of receiverships. Assets held by the FDIC in its receivership capacity for closed BIF-insured institutions are the main source of repayment of the BIF's receivables from closed banks. An allowance for loss of $5.3 billion, or 99% of the gross receivable, was recorded as of December 31, 2001. Of the remaining one percent of the gross receivable, the amount of credit risk is limited since 59% of the receivership assets consist of cash and cash equivalents., 94864=Provision for insurance losses was $1.8 billion for 2001 and negative $153 million for 2000. The following chart lists the major components of the provision for insurance losses., 58561=In 2001, the BIF reported a gross realized gain of $78 million on the sale of securities designated as available-for-sale. Proceeds from the sales were $1.5 billion. Specific identification was used to determine cost of the securities sold in computing the realized gain., 47216=Other Significant Legislation The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 established the Financing Corporation (FICO) as a mixed-ownership government corporation whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the FSLIC., 43752=NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2001 and 2000, 50447=The FDICIA established a limitation on obligations that can be incurred by the BIF, known as the Maximum Obligation Limitation (MOL). As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the MOL for the BIF was $55.4 billion and $53.2 billion, respectively., 44434=Legislative History The U.S. Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) through enactment of the Banking Act of 1933. The FDIC was created to restore and maintain public confidence in the nation\u0092s banking system., 79930=Assets held by the FDIC in its receivership capacity for closed BIF-insured institutions are the main source of repayment of the BIF\u0092s receivables from closed banks. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, BIF receiverships held assets with a book value of $154.6 million and $510.9 million, respectively (including cash and miscellaneous receivables of $71.9 million and $337 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively). The estimated cash recoveries from the management and disposition of these assets that are used to derive the allowance for losses are based in part on a statistical sampling of receivership assets. These estimated recoveries are regularly evaluated, but remain subject to uncertainties because of potential changes in economic conditions. Such uncertainties could cause the BIF\u0092s and other claimants\u0092 actual recoveries to vary from the level currently estimated., 94248=The FICO assessment has no financial impact on the BIF. The FICO assessment is separate from the regular assessments and is imposed on banks and thrifts, not on the insurance funds. The FDIC, as administrator of the BIF and the SAIF, is acting solely as a collection agent for the FICO. During 2001 and 2000, $627 million and $635 million, respectively, was collected from banks and remitted to the FICO., 104067=Accrued Annual Leave The BIF\u0092s pro rata share of the Corporation\u0092s liability to employees for accrued annual leave is approximately $35.3 million and $36.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively., 49913=The BIF is primarily funded from: 1) interest earned on investments in U.S. Treasury obligations and 2) deposit insurance assessments. Additional funding sources are U.S. Treasury and Federal Financing Bank (FFB) borrowings, if necessary. The 1990 OBR Act established the FDIC\u0092s authority to borrow working capital from the FFB on behalf of the BIF and the SAIF. The FDICIA increased the FDIC\u0092s authority to borrow for insurance losses from the U.S. Treasury, on behalf of the BIF and the SAIF, from $5 billion to $30 billion., 44856=The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) was enacted to reform, recapitalize, and consolidate the federal deposit insurance system. The FIRREA created the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF), and the FSLIC Resolution Fund (FRF). It also designated the FDIC as the administrator of these funds. All three funds are maintained separately to carry out their respective mandates., 48147=The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) was enacted on November 12, 1999, in order to modernize the financial services industry (banks, brokerages, insurers, and other financial services providers). The GLBA lifts restrictions on affiliations among banks, securities firms, and insurance companies. It also expands the financial activities permissible for financial holding companies and insured depository institutions, their affiliates and subsidiaries., 105746=Commitments: Leases The BIF\u0092s allocated share of the FDIC\u0092s lease commitments totals $132 million for future years. The lease agreements contain escalation clauses resulting in adjustments, usually on an annual basis. The allocation to the BIF of the FDIC\u0092s future lease commitments is based upon current relationships of the workloads among the BIF, the SAIF, and the FRF. Changes in the relative workloads could cause the amounts allocated to the BIF in the future to vary from the amounts shown below. The BIF recognized leased space expense of $38.5 million and $38.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively., 91198=The 1990 OBR Act removed caps on assessment rate increases and authorized the FDIC to set assessment rates for BIF members semiannually, to be applied against a member\u0092s average assessment base. The FDICIA: 1) required the FDIC to implement a risk-based assessment system; 2) authorized the FDIC to increase assessment rates for BIF-member institutions as needed to ensure that funds are available to satisfy the BIF\u0092s obligations; 3) required the FDIC to build and maintain the reserves in the insurance funds to 1.25 percent of estimated insured deposits; and 4) authorized the FDIC to increase assessment rates more frequently than semiannually and impose emergency special assessments as necessary to ensure that funds are available to repay U.S. Treasury borrowings., 47559=The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (1990 OBR Act), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), and the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 (DIFA) made changes to the FDIC\u0092s assessment authority (see Note 7) and borrowing authority. The FDICIA also requires the FDIC to: 1) resolve failing institutions in a manner that will result in the least possible cost to the deposit insurance funds and 2) maintain the insurance funds at 1.25 percent of estimated insured deposits or a higher percentage as circumstances warrant., 91977=The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that charges higher rates to those institutions that pose greater risks to the BIF. To arrive at a risk-based assessment for a particular institution, the FDIC places each institution in one of nine risk categories, using a two-step process based first on capital ratios and then on other relevant information. The assessment rate averaged approximately 0.14 cents per $100 of assessable deposits for both 2001 and 2000. On October 23, 2001, the Board voted to retain the BIF assessment schedule at the annual rate of 0 to 0.27 cents per $100 of assessable deposits for the first semiannual period of 2002. The Board reviews premium rates semiannually., 56945=Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made in the 2000 financial statements to conform to the presentation used in 2001., 92682=As stated above, the FDICIA requires the FDIC to maintain the insurance funds at a designated reserve ratio (DRR) of 1.25 percent of estimated insured deposits (or a higher percentage as circumstances warrant). As of December 31, 2001, the BIF was 1.26 percent of estimated insured deposits. The FDICIA authorizes and mandates BIF assessments if needed to maintain the fund at the DRR or to return the fund to the DRR if it falls below the DRR. The FDIC is required to set semiannual assessment rates that are sufficient to increase the reserve ratio to the DRR not later than one year after such rates are set, or in accordance with a recapitalization schedule of fifteen years or less., 58058=During 2001, FDIC purchased $1.1 billion of callable U.S. Treasury securities for the BIF. These securities are designated as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, with the premiums being amortized to the first call date. Callable U.S. Treasury bonds may be called five years prior to the respective bonds\u0092 stated maturity on their semi-annual coupon payment dates upon 120 days notice. On February 15, 2002, $525 million of these securities were called at par, with no loss to the BIF., 48604=Recent Legislative Initiatives Legislation on deposit insurance reform was introduced during February 2002 in the House and Senate. The legislative proposals include merging BIF and SAIF, modifying restrictions on charging risk-based insurance premiums, implementing assessment credits and rebates, changing the designated reserve ratio from a fixed 1.25 percent of estimated insured deposits to a range, increasing deposit insurance coverage for all accounts (including higher coverage for retirement accounts), and indexing the insurance limit to inflation. These provisions may have a significant impact on the BIF and the SAIF, if enacted into law. FDIC management cannot predict which provisions, if any, will ultimately be enacted., 104382=Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions The FDIC provides certain dental and life insurance coverage for its eligible retirees, the retirees\u0092 beneficiaries, and covered dependents. Retirees eligible for life insurance coverage are those who have qualified due to: 1) immediate enrollment upon appointment or five years of participation in the plan and 2) eligibility for an immediate annuity. Dental coverage is provided to all retirees eligible for an immediate annuity. The life insurance program provides basic coverage at no cost to retirees and allows converting optional coverages to direct-pay plans. Dental coverage is provided to all retirees eligible for an immediate annuity and at no cost to retirees. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the BIF\u0092s prepaid postretirement benefit cost recognized in the \u0093Interest receivable on investments and other assets, net\u0094 line item in the Statements of Financial Position was $3.6 million., 122618=Last Updated 11/8/2002, 93849=BIF-insured banks began paying a FICO assessment on January 1, 1997. From January 1, 1997, through December 31, 1999, the FICO assessment rate on BIF-assessable deposits was one-fifth the rate for SAIF-assessable deposits. Beginning on January 1, 2000, the annual FICO interest obligations of approximately $790 million are paid on a pro rata basis using the same rate for banks and thrifts., 57398=Cash not required to meet the liquidity needs of the BIF is invested in U.S. Treasury obligations with maturities exceeding three months. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the book value of investments in U.S. Treasury obligations, net, was $30.2 billion and $29.9 billion, respectively. The book value is computed by adding the amortized cost of the held-to-maturity securities to the market value of the available-for-sale securities. As of December 31, 2001, the FDIC held $5.5 billion of Treasury inflation-indexed securities (TIIS) for the BIF. These securities are indexed to increases or decreases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)., 87111=The contingent liability is derived by applying expected failure rates and historical loss rates to groups of institutions with certain shared characteristics. In addition, institution-specific analysis is performed on those banks where failure is imminent absent institution management resolution of existing problems. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the contingent liabilities for anticipated failure of insured institutions were $1.9 billion and $141 million, respectively.}",
