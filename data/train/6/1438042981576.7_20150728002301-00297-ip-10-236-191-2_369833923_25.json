The ipv6-prefix must be in the form documented in RFC 2373 where the address is specified in hexadecimal using 16-bit values between colons. The prefix length is a decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). For example, 2001:DB8:8086:6502::/32 is a valid IPv6 prefix., 41570=An IPv6 multicast address is an IPv6 address that has a prefix of FF00::/8 (1111 1111). An IPv6 multicast address is an identifier for a set of interfaces that typically belong to different nodes. A packet sent to a multicast address is delivered to all interfaces identified by the multicast address. The second octet following the prefix defines the lifetime and scope of the multicast address. A permanent multicast address has a lifetime parameter equal to 0; a temporary multicast address has a lifetime parameter equal to 1. A multicast address that has the scope of a node, link, site, or organization, or a global scope has a scope parameter of 1, 2, 5, 8, or E, respectively. For example, a multicast address with the prefix FF02::/16 is a permanent multicast address with a link scope. The figure below shows the format of the IPv6 multicast address., 401999=RFC 2472, 402534=RFC 2590, 402266=RFC 2492, 400778=RFC 2462, 196746=Router(config-if)# ipv6 nd nud retry 1 1000 3, 152219=The ipv6-prefix argument in the ipv6 address command must be in the form documented in RFC 2373 where the address is specified in hexadecimal using 16-bit values between colons. The / prefix-length keyword and argument in the ipv6 address command is a decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). A slash mark must precede the decimal value., 15021=0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1, 399904=RFC 2374, 15369=0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0, 7844=IPv6, formerly named IPng (next generation), is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP). IP is a packet-based protocol used to exchange data, voice, and video traffic over digital networks. IPv6 was proposed when it became clear that the 32-bit addressing scheme of IP version 4 (IPv4) was inadequate to meet the demands of Internet growth. IPv6 is based on IP but with a much larger address space and improvements such as a simplified main header and extension headers. IPv6 is described initially in RFC 2460, Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification, issued by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Further RFCs describe the architecture and services supported by IPv6., 400490=RFC 2461, 402848=RFC 2684, 28961=A link-local address is an IPv6 unicast address that can be automatically configured on any interface using the link-local prefix FE80::/10 (1111 1110 10) and the interface identifier in the modified EUI-64 format. Link-local addresses are used in the neighbor discovery protocol and the stateless autoconfiguration process. Nodes on a local link can use link-local addresses to communicate; the nodes do not need globally unique addresses to communicate. The figure below shows the structure of a link-local address., 401064=RFC 2463, 356056=In the following example, the show frame-relay map command is used to verify that the IPv6 address of a remote node is mapped to the DLCI of the PVC used to reach the address. The following example shows that the link-local and global IPv6 addresses (FE80::E0:F727:E400:A and 2001:DB8:2222:1044::73; FE80::60:3E47:AC8:8 and 2001.DB8:2222:1044::72) of two remote nodes are explicitly mapped to DLCI 17 and DLCI 19, respectively. Both DLCI 17 and DLCI 19 are terminated on interface serial 3 of this node; therefore, interface serial 3 of this node is a point-to-multipoint interface., 399341=RFC 1981, 44410=IPv6 routers must also join the all-routers multicast group FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2 (scope is link-local)., 401706=RFC 2467}",

IPv6 Extension Header Format Figure 10 Following the eight fields of the basic IPv6 packet header are optional extension headers and the data portion of the packet. If present, each extension header is aligned to 64 bits. There is no fixed number of extension headers in an IPv6 packet. Together, the extension headers form a chain of headers. Each extension header is identified by the Next Header field of the previous header. Typically, the final extension header has a Next Header field of a transport-layer protocol, such as TCP or UDP.

    "textAfterTable": "Cisco Express Forwarding and Distributed Cisco Express Forwarding Switching for IPv6 Cisco Express Forwarding is advanced, Layer 3 IP switching technology for the forwarding of IPv6 packets. Distributed Cisco Express Forwarding performs the same functions as Cisco Express Forwarding but for distributed architecture platforms such as the GSRs and the Cisco 7500 series routers. Distributed Cisco Express Forwarding for IPv6 and Cisco Express Forwarding for IPv6 function the same and offer the same benefits as for distributed Cisco Express Forwarding for IPv4 and Cisco Express Forwarding for IPv4--network entries that are added, removed, or modified in the IPv6 Routing Information Base (RIB), as dictated by the routing protocols in use, are reflected in the Forwarding Information Bases (FIBs), and the IPv6 adjacency tables maintain Layer 2 next-hop addresses for all entries in each FIB. Note By default, the GSRs support only distributed Cisco Express Forwarding (Cisco Express Forwarding switching is performed by the line cards). The Cisco 7500 series routers support both Cisco Express Forwarding and distributed Cisco Express Forwarding. When Cisco Express Forwarding is configured on Cisco 7500 series routers, Cisco Express Forwarding switching is performed by the Route Processor (RP); when distributed Cisco Express Forwarding is configured, Cisco Express Forwarding switching is performed by the line cards.",
