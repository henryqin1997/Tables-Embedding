A magnetic strip assembly 2100 comprises a magnetic strip 2101, according to this implementation, which is attached to a base, such as a card 2102. The card 2102 preferably has a depressed area 2103 in which the magnetic strip 2101 is placed. The magnetic strip can store several hundred bits of data per inch., 569577=The fifth byte 2964 is used for storing the tape label for accessing the library, if such feature is installed in the VCR. Bytes 6 to 8 of the housekeeping data are reserved for future use., 327766=The user inserts the un-indexed recorded tape (this tape is to become a retroactively indexed tape) into the VCR 1 and rewinds the tape to the beginning of the tape (BOT) (step 9220). The user then presses the index button on the remote controller 75 or 1300 and selects retro-indexing from the menu display on the screen 50 a (step 9221). Alternatively, the remote controller 1300 may have a retroactively indexed button. Upon that selection, the microprocessor controller 31 then writes a TID and an absolute address on the control track 42C (step 9222). The TID is randomly created in the manner described above in FIG. 24. The microprocessor controller 31 then displays on the display 50 a a prompt to the user to enter the title of the first program or show on the tape and to press the ENTER button on the remote controller 1300 or alternatively to push button X to indicate that it is at the end of the tape (EOT) (step 9223). Button X may be any button on the remote controller 1300 that is not used for entering a title, for example the VCR Plus+\u2122 button. Alternatively, the title of programs may be entered after all programs have been numbered. If the ENTER button has been pushed (step 9224), the microprocessor controller 31 then prompts the user on the video display 50 to fast forward (FF) the tape to the beginning of the next program and push button X (step 9226). The microprocessor controller 31 uses the monitored signals from the tape movement sensor 22 and processed by the position logic and counter circuit 9 to calculate the tape distance traveled measured by counting the control track pulses and take-up spool spindle counts as described below (step 9227). Tape distance measuring methods are described below. The microprocessor controller 31 then repeats the process of writing the TID and the address on the control track 42C at step 9222 and prompts the user to enter the title of the show at step 9223. At subsequent passes through step 9222, the address now written on the control track 42C is the address calculated from the tape distance that has been traveled during the fast forward to the program at step 9227., 284300=FIG. 25 is a schematic view showing the format for the directory packet recorded in the VBI for prerecorded tapes. The directory preferably provides up to 32 characters per table. A D(N) packet 2601 has the following symbols: start code, type, N, start address, stop address, record speed, program category, version, language, title text, expand byte, stop code and checksum. Table VII shows the length in bytes and the value for each symbol. The N symbol represents the program number in the directory when N is greater than 0. Each byte is a coded text number from 30 hex to 3F hex which equates to 0 hex to F hex (when N equals 0, the packet described below in conjunction with FIG. 26 is used to represent the title of the tape). The start address symbol represents the number of minutes measured in the SLP mode from the beginning of the tape to the beginning of the program. The stop address symbol represents the number of minutes measured in the SLP mode from the beginning of the tape to the end of the program. Each byte of the start address and stop address symbols is a coded hexadecimal number from 30 hex to 3F hex which form a number having the largest possible value of FFF hex. A record speed symbol defines the recording speed of the program. The recording speed symbol represents the optimal tape speed at which the indexing VCR 10 should record the program. For example, a super long play speed may be transmitted for programs, such as sports or nature programs, where the user may want to use the freeze frame feature. As another example, a standard play speed may be transmitted for recording long programs so as to conserve tape. If the recording speed is defined to be blank, the length is defined based on SLP for better resolution. An \u201cundefined\u201d recording speed is used when the recording speed changes during a program. Undefined values are reserved for further expansion. A program category (PC) symbol is defined per the E.I.A. definition. The version symbol identifies the version of the program titled format. For versions other than 20 hex, the indexing VCR 10 ignores the following bytes up to a terminator code (which is preferably 1E hex) and displays the titled text as a blank line. A language symbol represents different languages. The title text symbol has a length of M bytes where M is a variable even number, preferably not greater than 40, including the 1E hex terminator code. The title text symbol represents the program title in ASCII and is terminated by the character 1E hex. If the character number is odd, one more null character is added before the terminator code. In addition, an attribute character can be added to the title text to enhance the indexing display. The attribute character starts with a value of 1D hex which is followed by a character in the range 20 hex to 7F hex. Attribute codes are defined below in conjunction with FIG. 55. The expand byte symbol has a length of N bytes where N is a variable even number from 0 to 6. The expand bytes are used for expansion code for the indexing VCR 10. The checksum symbol is defined as the modulo 128 sum of the packet from the start code to the stop code. As will be described below, the D(N) data packet 2601 is encrypted and must be decrypted by an algorithm in the microprocessor controller 31 (FIG. 1) or the chip 702 (FIG. 7) in the indexing VCR 10., 600135=During block S6, the microprocessor controller 31 causes the VCR control logic circuit 21 and the motor and mechanical control circuit 5 to rewind the tape 42 so that the read/write heads 17, 19 are just before the directory. During block S7, the CURRENT LOC value 1049 (see FIG. 2) from the directory is used to set the tape counter in the position logic and counter circuit 9. During block S8, the directory is displayed by the display 32 e or by the video display 50 for user viewing, editing or input. The method now enters block S9 (FIG. 87b) and awaits further user instruction. If the PLAY button 3 b is activated by the user, processing continues in block S18. During block S19, the VCR 1 records or reads, i.e., plays tape and displays video images on the video screen 50 a. If instead the STOP button 3 c is activated, then in block S22 the microprocessor controller 31 causes the VCR control logic circuit 21 and the motor and mechanical control circuit 5 to stop the tape 42. The tape does 42 not necessarily stop at the end or beginning of a program., 511288=When Option 2 is selected at step 2774 and referring now to FIG. 59j, a screen such as FIG. 60p is displayed (step 27710). The user is given three options. Under the first option of FIG. 60p, the user can search for programs with specific program titles or subtitles (for example, programs which have a title containing the word \u201cYankee\u201d or which has a letter \u201cZ\u201d, \u201cCA\u201d, etc.) (step 27711). Under the second option of FIG. 60p, the user can search a specific type of programs (e.g. a sports program) (step 27717). Under the third option of FIG. 60p, the user can display the directory of a particular tape volume (step 27723)., 564822=To provide appropriate tolerance for possible misalignment due to variance in construction of different cassettes and tape recorder/players, as well as to provide tolerance between a cassette in tape player/recorder, each of the pads 2930 in the specific implantation is substantially square with dimensions of about 0.25\u2033\ufffd0.25\u2033. Center-to-center separation between adjacent pads is about 0.35\u2033., 503517=If the REVIEW option is entered as a result of a full CDTL buffer 1024 during the VCR Plus+\u2122 operation, the screen of FIG. 60k would list eight programs., 267800=One method for transmitting signals on AC power lines is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,418,333 to Schwarzbach, et al., issued Nov. 29, 1983, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference., 621277=Otherwise, control is passed to step 1428 and the system tests whether the menu button 1304 has been pressed. If not, control is passed back to step 1418. If so, the user has indicated that the displayed title is complete and the user wishes to save the title in the directory. Therefore, control is passed to step 1430 in which the title shown at 50 g is copied into one of the program title locations in the directory controller RAM 33. Control is passed to step 1406, thereby ending entry of a title., 480670=Referring to the flow-chart shown in FIG. 59, when a cassette tape 40 is loaded into the VCR 1, the microprocessor controller 31 is interrupted (step 2710). The microprocessor controller 31 then performs a check to see whether the inserted cassette tape is an enhanced cassette or a standard cassette (step 2711). An enhanced cassette is a cassette provided with a secondary memory for storing directory information; however, if the VCR is implemented in such a way that directory information is stored on the cassette tape (e.g. control track or VBI), step 2711 can be skipped. Depending upon the implementation, the secondary memory can either be a semiconductor memory or a magnetic strip carried by the cassette. The test can be performed in any one of many techniques, including the techniques described above, i.e. detecting for presence of an electrical conductor or a light-reflective material on the cassette, or reading a predefined code on the magnetic strip., 588950=At the end of the delay, the output from the data head is sampled (step 2026). If the output from the data head is the same as its value in the last clock (step 2027), a \u201c0\u201d bit is output (step 2028). Otherwise, if the output from the data head is changed, an \u201c1\u201d bit is output (step 2029). Steps 2022-2029 are repeated until the last data is read (step 2030)., 162631=The flags also include a feature control field (FTCNTL) 1013 for specifying the VCR functions that are available to a user. In the simplest case, if a secondary memory is needed on the cassette for storing directory information, FTCNTL 1013 will be set in one way if an inserted cassette has the secondary memory and in another way if the inserted cassette has no secondary memory. FTCNTL 1013 may also specify other functions, and can be set by reading a code carried at a predetermined area of the cassette (e.g. on a magnetic strip on the cassette housing)., 502984=\u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number settings can be reviewed by pressing the \u201cREVIEW\u201d key. A review operation can be performed at any time and can even be performed when there is no tape in the video player. With reference to FIG. 59 k, when the microprocessor controller 31 is interrupted by the REVIEW key (step 2761), it retrieves all the \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number settings (step 2762) from the CDTL buffer 1024. Based upon the data, a screen such as FIG. 60k is displayed (step 2763)., 554261=Data recorded on the magnetic strip 150 can be read by a read circuit implemented in accordance with read circuits commonly known to the art. FIG. 69 is a schematic circuit diagram of an exemplary read circuit. The figure shows a peak detection circuit 2650 coupled to the magnetic sensor 154 for reading signals recorded on the magnetic strip 150. Signals produced by the magnetic sensor 154 are inputted into a differential band amplifier 2651. Each side of the differential amplifier 2561 has a capacitor for adjusting the pass band for the input signal. Amplification of the circuit 2651 is adjustable by a variable resistor 2658., 207323=The VCR 1 also comprises a remote commander unit 1300 which communicates through wireless means with a remote signal receiver 29 in the VCR. As is known in the art, the remote commander comprises a plurality of push buttons, switches, and a jog shuttle knob which create output signals. The signals are transmitted by wireless means known in the art, such as infrared transmission or radio-frequency signals, to the remote signal receiver 29. The receiver 29 decodes the received signal and passes the decoded data to the VCR control logic circuit 21., 161415=Now the memory structure of the RAM 33 is described by referring to FIG. 2 which is a schematic conceptually illustrating a typical structure of the data stored in the RAM 33 according to one embodiment of the present invention. The RAM 33 can be viewed conceptually as having an area 1010 for storing operation flags. These flags include a mode flag (MODEFLAG) 1011 for indicating the operation speed (e.g. SP, LP, or SLP) of the VCR 1 and which will be changed whenever the operation speed of the VCR 1 is changed. A tape length flag (TAPELNG) 1012 indicates the length (e.g. E-60, E-90, E-120) of an inserted tape 42. A second memory flag 1014 (SECMEM) stores access information of a secondary memory which may be provided on the cassette 40 for storing directory information. For example, if the secondary memory is a magnetic strip, described below for FIGS. 66-70 and 74-93, SECMEM 1014 may store the recording density of a magnetic strip, or if the secondary memory is a semiconductor memory described below for FIGS. 71-73, SECMEM 1014 may store the access time and capacity thereof., 498854=The VCR can optionally be initiated to perform a \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number recording, in a similar way as a VCR PLUS+\u2122 remote controller from Gemstar Development Corporation of California. \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number recording is also described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/676,934 filed Mar. 27, 1991 and is incorporated herein by reference. \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d and VCR PLUS+\u2122 are trademarks of Gemstar Development Corporation. \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number recording is initiated by a \u201cVCR PLUS+\u2122\u201d key, which can be performed at any time, even when a broadcast or a recording is being watched, or when a rewind or fast forward operation is in progress, or when there is no cassette tape loaded in the VCR., 509067=on the screen and returns to step 2772 of FIG. 59h. If an enhanced cassette is loaded in the VCR, the microprocessor controller 31 will allocate space in the library area for adding the directory (step 2776). In one implementation, the microprocessor controller 31 then prompts the user to enter an volume label. In a preferred implementation, a Volume Number Counter 1016 is kept in the RAM 33, (e.g. inside the operation flags area). This counter 1016 stores the next volume number to be assigned to a newly-added tape. When execution of the add option begins, the microprocessor controller 31 takes the next volume number (assuming for purposes of illustration that it is 59) from the Volume Number Counter and assigns this volume number to the tape. Advantageously, if the library is implemented in such a way that each directory has a fixed amount of memory space, the volume number of a tape can be used as index to address the corresponding directory from the library., 559895=Another implementation of the feature control mark is to pre-record or pre-format a predefined bit pattern (for example, a bit string of \u201c101010\u201d) at a predetermined location (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cheader\u201d) of the magnetic strip. When the cassette is loaded into the VCR, the directory controller first reads the bit pattern from the header area. The bit pattern is read into the feature control field FTCNTL 1013 (FIG. 2) of the RAM 33 which is used to enable predefined functions of the VCR. It will be understood that the bit pattern may be modified as new models of VCR, with different functions or enhancements, are introduced., 430682=FIG. 55 is a schematic view showing the format for the CSPG/PRI packet data recorded in the VBI as pointed to by the pointer in line 21 of the VBI. The CSPG and PRI packets are similar in structure and are differentiated by the type code. The packet 2606 comprises the symbols: start code, type, usage, information, stop code and check sum. Table XI shows the length in bytes and the values for the symbols., 482117=The microprocessor controller 31 then locates a directory from the secondary memory (step 2713). If the VCR is implemented in such a way that directory information is stored on the cassette tape, or in a library stored in the RAM indexed by a volume number stored on the cassette tape, as previously described, the microprocessor controller 31 may have to activate the motor and mechanical control logic circuit 5 as well as the control and audio track head logic circuit 11 to search for the directory. If the directory information is found (step 2714), it is read into the in-use directory area 1021 (see FIG. 2) in the RAM 33 (step 2715). The directory information is used to fill a screen such as the one shown in FIG. 40a (step 2716). If the cassette is not an enhanced cassette, a screen, showing the conventional functions of a VCR is displayed (step 2717). If the directory is not found, a blank screen or a warning screen may be shown., 623515=A similar series of steps 1458, 1460, 1462, 1464 handles movement of the cursor to the right. In this case, overflow at step 1462 can result in freezing the cursor, moving it to the next row, etc., 475073=According to the above implementation, a counter, VOLCNTR, is kept in a non-volatile memory. The counter provides a count of the number of tapes of which a corresponding directory is already kept in the LIBMEM (hereinafter called an \u201cindexed tape\u201d). The value VOLNO 1016 (see FIG. 2) of VOLCNTR can therefore be used for assigning a unique volume number to an unindexed tape (i.e. one which does not have a directory stored in the LIBMEM)., 468579=The data is encrypted using a secret key encrypto-system such as the data encryption standard (DES) proposed by IBM and adopted by NBS in 1978., 569793=Directory data are recorded starting from the 9th byte 2965. The directory consists of various number of records, each storing information of a recorded program on the cassette tape including an index field, a program name and the length of the program., 584656=To facilitate the read and write operations to be performed in opposite directions, the data to be written into the data track of the magnetic strip 150 is preceded by a header 1901 as shown in FIG. 83B. The header 1901 is provided to synchronize the read/write circuit to the clock signals on the control track. The header 1901 according to the preferred embodiment contains 24 bits of \u201c1\u201d. Behind the header 1901 is a mark 1902 provided to indicate that whatever is read from the data track in the next clock cycle is a valid data bit. According to the preferred embodiment, the mark 1902 contains 6 \u201c0\u201d bits followed by 2 \u201c1\u201d bits. This bit pattern is chosen because it is not used to represent data. It will be understood that other bit patterns can be used., 163950=A directory pointer 1018 is also provided for pointing to an in-use directory 1021 which stores the directory of the currently inserted tape. This directory pointer 1018 may actually point to a location in the library wherein the directory of the tape is located., 593168=When the eject button 3 e is activated, the microprocessor controller 31, and the VCR control logic circuit 21 causes the current tape location (CURRENT LOC) 1049 in the RAM 33 to be updated with the tape counter value in the position logic and counter circuit 9 and causes the directory in the RAM 33 to be recorded onto the tape at roughly its current position and then causes the tape to be slightly rewound to the beginning of where the directory was recorded on the tape, and then causes the motor and mechanical control 5 to physically eject the cassette 40. In another implementation, the rewind operation of the tape is not performed after recording the directory thereon; however, when the tape is inserted, it is read backward to retrieve the directory., 577633=The card 2102 according to this implementation can be placed on the top of the cassette in a recess 2105 as shown in FIGS. 78-79 to reduce its exposure and the exposure of the magnetic strip., 623766=As shown in steps 1466 to 1476, similar processing can be conducted for the \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d arrow cursor keys. Wrap around can be implemented. For example, when the \u201cup\u201d arrow button is pressed and the cursor is currently on the first row 50 e, the cursor can be made to jump to the third row., 551310=Direction of movement of the magnetic head is controlled by a signal applied to the input of circuit 2610. When the input signal is low (FWD), both transistors 2613 and 2614 are shutoff. When transistor 2613 shuts off, transistor 2615 conducts, which then turns on transistor 2616 and thereby shuts off transistor 2618. When transistor 2615 conducts, it also shuts off transistor 2617 and thereby turns on transistor 2623. On the other hand, when transistor 2614 is shutoff, it causes transistor 2619 to shutoff and transistor 2620 to turn on. When transistor 2620 turns on, it causes transistor 2622 to shut off. Thus, a current passes from Vm (circuit 2611) through transistor 2621 into the right-hand side of the motor and exits 2624 from its left-hand side through transistor 2623, causing the motor 2624 to rotate in one direction., 587954=FIG. 84C illustrates the logic sequence for a read operation of the magnetic strip 150. In step 2020, the read/write circuit waits for detection of a transition on the control track., 555433=The output from the amplifier 2652 is also received by a circuit 2655 which converts negative portions of the output signals into positive value. In other words, the circuit 2655 outputs the absolute value of signal received from the circuit 2652. The circuit provides an envelope from which level change of the sensed signal is detected. The output from the circuit 2655 is symmetrically adjusted by a symmetry circuit 2656. The output of the symmetry circuit 2656 is applied to a mask circuit 2657 which masks off signals that are lower than a predetermined value. The output from the circuit 2657 is applied to the enable input of the digital buffer 2654 to enable signals from the circuit 2653 to be registered by the buffer 2654., 579343=The arm 2502 is mounted to a member 2508 by a pivot 2510 which gives it a freedom of vertical movement. The member 2508 is in turn mounted to a cantilever 2509 by another pivot 2511 which gives it a freedom of horizontal movement to adjust for the small displacement of the tape 2506. The head 2501 is mounted onto the arm by a pivot 2516 to provide azimuth alignment, that is, to enable the head 2501 to move in parallel with the tape 2506 even when the arm 2502 shifts in adjusting for a displaced tape., 572789=When the tape in inserted into the VCR, the directory is read from the semiconductor memory serially and stored in the in-use directory area of the RAM. When the in-use directory in the RAM is changed, as a result of either one or more modification to its content or addition/deletion of programs recorded on the tape, its content can be written immediately back to the semiconductor memory. In writing the directory to the semiconductor memory, the microprocessor controller retrieves the content of the in-use directory one byte at a time, shifts the byte to an output register and sends the content of the output register to the semiconductor. Data transfer to the semiconductor memory 2910 is described in the product specification of the 24C04A from Microchip Technology., 505663=After the review screen is displayed, the microprocessor controller 31 waits for an input from the user (step 2767). Referring now to FIG. 591, when the user enters a number key (1-8 in the example of a full CDTL buffer noted above) (step 2768), the corresponding entry is selected (step 2769). If the user then presses the ERASE key (step 27610), the selected entry is deleted from the CDTL buffer 1024 (step 27611). If the \u201cREVIEW\u201d key is pressed again under the review screen (step 27612) or if the tape is ejected from the VCR, the review operation is terminated., 562171=FIG. 70i illustrates another implementation of the feature control mark. According to this implementation, one or more electrically conductive path is provided on the cassette casing, such as by printing one or more strip 3073 on a designated area with conductive ink. At each end of the conductive path is a pad 3074. Two electrical contacts 3075 are provided from the VCR such that when the cassette is seated in the VCR, the two contacts 3075 would press against and contact the two pads 3074 respectively. The contacts 3075 are coupled to an electrical circuit 3076 such as the one illustrated in FIG. 70j. If the conductive path 3073 is present on a cassette, the two contacts 3075 are shorted and the output of circuit 3076 is at one voltage level. If a cassette does not have the conductive path, the two contacts are open and the output of the circuit 3076 is at another voltage level. The voltage is read by the microprocessor controller 31 to set FTCNTL 1013 in the RAM 33., 483165=Referring to FIG. 60a, the enhanced screen contains a listing of the titles and lengths of the programs recorded on the cassette. In one implementation, six programs are displayed each time. The programs not shown can be accessed by scrolling or paging, using either the \u201cPG DN\u201d key for scrolling or paging forward or the \u201cPG UP\u201d key for scrolling or paging backward. The enhanced directory screen 1101 comprises several columns. The first column contains the indexes of the displayed programs, each represented by a number of 1-2 digits, with no leading zeros., 219987=In alternate embodiments, two separate address systems are used. In a high resolution address system (HRAS), the VCR writes an absolute address at high repetition rate (e.g., once every few seconds) on a line of the VBI. The absolute addressing system is maintained both for finding the current location as well as for calculating the length of programs and blank spaces. The absolute address is a measure of the distance from the beginning of the tape. For example, an address with a value of 1120 may represent a distance from the beginning of the tape after the take-up spool spindle has made 140 revolutions (with 8 counts per revolution). This information may be written once every few seconds. Alternatively, the absolute address may represent the time from the beginning of the tape. Because the play time depends on the recording speed of the tape, the time from the beginning of the tape should also account for the different tape speeds. The second type of address system is a low resolution address system (LRAS) where the absolute address is written on the control track at the beginning of each program as well as the end of the last program as an address mark. An alternate LRAS is to write only marks, such as VISS or VASS marks, in the control track at the beginning of each program on the tape and at the end of the tape., 588170=When a transition is detected, the read/write circuit enters step 2021 in which it resets and starts a timer. In step 2022, the read/write circuit waits for the occurrence of another transition on the control track. When such a transition is detected, the timer is read and then reset, and the time difference, Tr, between the two consecutive transitions on the control track is calculated (step 2023). In step 2024, the read/write circuit waits for a delay so that the data track can be sampled at peak value. If steps 2004 and 2005 of the write operation of FIG. 25A are performed, the delay is Tr*(Tl/Tc). If steps 2004 and 2005 in the write operation are not performed, the delay is (Tr/2)+Tr(Tl/Tc)., 550479=Operation of the motor 159 is controlled by a control circuit 2610 schematically illustrated in FIG. 67. Movement of the head assembly 156 is dependent upon the rotational speed of the motor 159 which in turn is dependent upon the voltage output from circuit 2611 of the circuit 2610. This voltage can be adjusted by changing the variable resistor within the circuit 2611., 583861=In step 2008, the read/write circuit determines whether the write operation is completed. Step 2003 will be performed again if there are data left., 579110=The arm 2502 has means or guides 2503, such as a ball-point finger, for engaging to a guide 2507, such as a groove, which guides the head 2501 along over the magnetic strip 2506., 217335=In the FMAS address system, the absolute address is written on the control track 42 c of the tape 42 in the form of address packets using the data encoding and decoding described above in connection with FIGS. 10a-10 i. The absolute address is a measure of the distance from the beginning of the tape. This distance is preferably determined by counting control track pulses. For example, an address at a point of the tape may be the number of seconds in the SLP mode from the beginning of the tape to that point. Thus, an E-120 tape has an address range from 0 to 21600 (120 minutes\ufffd60 seconds). An address of 1140, for example, defines a point whose distance from the beginning of the tape can be covered in 1,140 seconds in SLP mode. If the VCR mode is recording or replaying in SP mode from the beginning, then after 380 seconds (1140 seconds\ufffd3), the address is also 1140. If there is a blank space in between two programs, the address system takes that into account. For example, if program 1 is recorded in SLP mode and has an address of 1,000 at the end of the program, the tape then travels some distance before it starts program 2. Since there is no video signal between the end of program 1 and the beginning of program 2, there are no control track pulses to keep track of the distance travelled. In this case, the takeup spools spindle revolution counts can be used to interpolate. For example, the takeup spool spindle may be counting 1 count for 30 control track pulses, i.e. 1 address count at the end of program 1. At the beginning of program 2, the takeup spool may be counted in two counts for 30 control track pulses, i.e. 1 address count at the beginning of program 2. Thus, on the average, the takeup spool counts 1.5 counts per 30 control track pulses, i.e. 1 address count for the blank space between program 1 and program 2. If the takeup spindle counts 150 counts of blank space, it is assumed the control track would have counted 3,000 control track pulses (150\ufffd1.5\ufffd30), i.e. 100 address counts. The starting address of program 2 is 1,000 (end of address of program 1)+100 (length of blank area)=1,100. The absolute address is written once at the beginning of each program and at the end of the last program. For HR tapes and PR tapes, the address is repeated as often as possible (in the order of once every few seconds) between the beginning and the end of every program. For RI tapes, the address is repeated as often as possible for some programs as will be described in detail below., 577858=Alternatively, the card with the magnetic strip may be placed on the back of the cassette casing as shown FIG. 80, and preferably in a recess thereon. If the thickness of the cassette is not long enough, then the magnetic strip can be divided into two portions, 2302 and 2303, to be read with two magnetic heads. The card for carrying the magnetic strip is depicted in FIG. 80 as 2301., 604153=The operation sequence enters block S9 (FIG. 87B) after the tape cassette is loaded and awaits a function selection. The program enters block S10 when the user actuates the function SEARCH button 32 b. During block S11, under control of the microprocessor controller 31, information is displayed on either the directory display 32 e or the video display 50 which prompts the user to input on the keyboard 32 a the name of the program or optionally, a program number on which to search. During block S12, the microprocessor controller 31 compares the value of the current tape location counter 1049 (see FIG. 3) with the program location value LOC from the RAM 33 for the program input by the user. If the program is located ahead on the tape, the microprocessor controller 31 causes the VCR control logic circuit 21 and the motor and mechanical control circuit 5 to advance the tape 42 to the desired location during block S13. Otherwise, if the program is already past the current location, then the microprocessor controller 31 causes the VCR control logic circuit 21 and the motor and mechanical control circuit 5 to rewind the tape 42 to the desired location during block S14 following which the program is read and is displayed on the screen 50 a., 166353=A field 1051 is a pointer pointing to the address of the first entry of the directory 1021 represented in FIG. 3 by an arrow pointing to the program name (PROGRAM) 1042. Each entry also has a field 1048 storing the address of the next entry in the directory also represented in FIG. 3 by an arrow pointing to program 12. These fields provide a link from one entry to the next entry and are used for facilitating search, deletion, and addition of entries. In the preferred embodiment, the directory information is not stored on the tape 42, but is retrieved from the library 1023. In this embodiment, a volume label (VOLNO) 1050 is provided in the in-use directory 1021. This field is used for retrieving the directory information of the tape from a library 1023 stored in the RAM 33., 550245=The magnetic sensor in the specific embodiment is a magnetic head of model number SK-12426 from Nortronics, Dassel, Minn. The motor in the specific embodiment is a D.C. motor with part number FK-130RH from Mabuchi., 578582=FIGS. 82a and 82 b are side and top views of a magnetic write/sensor head unit 2500 implemented for reading data from and writing data to a magnetic strip., 583253=Steps 2004 and 2005 are performed for the benefit of read operations, so that data can be sampled at time instances where the magnitude of the magnetic field is at peak values, as shown in FIG. 24C. These two steps can be omitted if appropriate actions are performed during the read operations., 461187=FIG. 56 is a schematic view showing the VM packet used for video magazines. A VM packet 2607 comprises the symbols: start code, type, PID, stop code, and check sum. Table XIII shows the length in bytes and values for the symbols. As described above, in connection with FIG. 45, during the broadcast of video magazines, a set of VM packets are transmitted in the VBI within the program to trigger the indexing VCR 10 to record VISS marks on the control track and TP packets on line 19 of the VBI and create a corresponding directory that is stored in the RAM 33. The VM packets are located on at least one VBI line which is referenced by a pointer on line 21, field 2 of the VBI. The pointer packet data format is described above in connection with FIG. 54 where the pointer description equals 65 hex, which indicates a VM packet. The checksum is the modulo 128 sum of the packet from the start code to the stop code., 105246=This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/014,541, filed Feb. 8, 1993 now ABN, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/001,125, filed Jan. 5, 1993 now ABN, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser.

No. 07/805,844, filed Dec. 5, 1991 now ABN, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 07/747,127, filed Aug. 19, 1991 now ABN, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by this reference., 566554=In the specific implementation, the first 64 addressable bits (8 bytes) of the memory device are reserved for housekeeping purposes. Referring to FIG. 73, the first byte 2961 of the housekeeping data is an identification pattern, such as a ASCII character \u201cI\u201d, for controlling operation of the VCR and also information for enabling or disabling certain enhanced functions of the VCR. Upon being loaded into a VCR, this data will be read into the FNCNTL field in the RAM., 578785=The magnetic write/sensor unit 2500 comprises a magnetic write/sensor head 2501 pivotally mounted on an arm 2502. The head 2501 has guides 2503, such as U-shape guides, for confining a magnetic strip 2506 beneath it as the magnetic strip 2506 passes under., 582652=In step 2001, the read/write circuit waits for a transition on the control track to occur. Upon encountering the first transition, the read/write circuit enters step 2002, in which it resets and starts a timer., 632379=The invalidation of step 1805 can be performed, for example, by setting an \u201cinvalidate\u201d bit stored with the entry., 418921=FIG. 54 is a schematic view showing the format for the pointer packet data broadcasted in the VBI for auxiliary information. The pointer packet is similar to the E.I.A. line 21 field 2 Supplemental Data Location packet. It is used as a pointer to point to another VBI line. Four to thirty-two informational characters are used to indicate the line number where the information is located. A pointer packet data packet 2605 has the following symbols: start code, type, additional ID, pointer description (1) and pointer (1) through pointer description (m) and pointer (m), stop code and check sum., 619467=Control is passed to step 1410 in which the system waits until a key is pressed on the remote control unit 1300. If a cursor key 1305 if pressed, control is passed to step 1412 and the on-screen cursor is moved to a new location. Otherwise, the control is passed to step 1414 in which the system tests whether the enter button 1303 has been pressed. If so, control is passed to step 1416 and the cursor is moved to the character \u201cQ\u201d in the first row 50 e of the keyboard representation 50 d. Control is passed to step 1418 in which the system tests whether a cursor key 1305 has been pressed. If so, control is passed to step 1422 and the cursor is moved to the next character in the keyboard representation 50 d. If desired, the current character can be highlighted or shown in reverse video, as indicated by the character \u201cC\u201d at 50 j. Otherwise, control is passed to step 1420 and the system tests whether the jog shuttle knob 3 f has been moved. If so, control is passed to step 1422 to move the cursor. Otherwise, control is passed to step 1424 and the system tests whether the enter key 1303 has been pressed. If so, the user is indicating that the current highlighted character 50 j is desired to be entered in the current character 50 k of the title 50 g. Therefore, the control is passed to step 1426 in which the character 50 j is copied to location 50 k and \u201cfrozen\u201d in place by displaying it in normal video. Control is then passed to step 1422, to advance the character position cursor 50 k to the next position., 625343=An alternate method for creating video titles is shown in FIGS. 91A and 91B. Steps 1502-1508 are the same as steps 1404-1412 of FIG. 90A. When step 1404 is reached, the display shown in FIG. 91B is placed on the video screen 50 a by the character generator unit 23., 583588=In step 2006, the data bit to be output is examined, if the output bit is a \u201c1\u201d, a signal is sent to the write/sensor head to change the magnetic field on the data track (step 2007). If the output bit is a \u201c0\u201d, step 2007 is omitted., 621856=FIG. 90B illustrates a method for advancing a keyboard representation cursor such as that shown at position 50 j. Since the entire keyboard 50 d is represented as a plurality of rows 50 e, a command (using the cursor keys or jog shuttle knob) to advance the cursor requires special processing at the end of each row. For example, in step 1450 the system tests whether the left arrow cursor key has been pressed or the jog shuttle knob has been moved to the left. If so, the next task (step 1452) is to test whether the current character position is at the far left end of one of the rows 50 e, i.e., whether the current character is Q, A, or Z. If so, control is passed to step 1454 in which the system handles the overflow condition by taking one of a plurality of possible steps. If desired, the system can simply do nothing, causing the cursor to freeze at the left end of the row. Alternatively, the cursor can jump to the far right end of the same row. For example, if the current character is \u201cQ\u201d and the user presses the left arrow cursor key, the cursor could jump to the letter \u201cP\u201d at the far end of the row. Further, the method could cause the cursor to jump to the end of the previous row, with \u201cwrap around\u201d if desired. Thus, if the cursor is on the letter \u201cA\u201d and the user presses the left arrow, the cursor can jump to the letter \u201cP\u201d on the row above. Any of these steps can be taken in step 1454. Otherwise, if the current cursor position is in the middle of a row, control is passed to step 1456 and the cursor is moved to the left., 301424=Table VIII shows the length in bytes and the value of each symbol. The D(0) data packet 2602 is similar to the D(N) data packet 2601 described below in FIG. 71 where the parameters, start address, stop address, PC, and record speed are redefined to denote the length of tape and the reel diameter. The D(0) data packet 2602 is predefined as the tape parameter packet for both HR and PR tapes. The length symbol indicates the length of the tape in minutes at the SLP speed. Each byte is a coded hexadecimal number which provides a value in the range of 000 hex to FFF hex. The reel diameter symbol indicates the physical diameter of the tape reel in millimeters. The version symbol indicates the version of the tape title format. For versions other than 20 hex (the first version), the indexing VCR 10 ignores the following bytes up to the terminator code contained within the title text symbol and displays the text title as a blank line. The language symbol represents the different languages around the world. Other values for the language symbol may be defined by the manufacturer of the indexing VCR 10. The length of the title text is in bytes where M is a variable even number including the terminator code. The title text symbol represents the tape title in ASCII and is terminated by the character 1E hex. If the character number is odd, one null character is added before the terminator code 1E hex. An attribute character can be added to the text at a later stage. The expand byte symbol has a length of N bytes where N is a variable odd number ranging from zero to five. The value of the check sum is the modulo 128 sum of the packet from the start code to the stop code., 576874=A strip of resilient material (not shown) is placed between the card 2102 and the magnetic strip 2101 to improve its contact with a magnetic write/sensor head. A guide, such as a groove 2104, is provided on the card 2101 to guide a magnetic write/sensor head to ensure that it moves over the magnetic strip in a read/write operation. The groove 2104 will be used to engage a pin on the magnetic head. Also, each end of the groove may be widened to assist the pin of a magnetic head to engage to the groove 2104. On the other side of the card, adhesive substance is provided for adhering the card to the cassette. A sliding cover (not shown) may optionally be provided to protect the magnetic tape., 163232=Area 1010 also stores a message pointer 1017 pointing to a message area 1022 which stores input and output messages; and a CDTL pointer 1019 pointing to a CDTL buffer 1024 which stores channel-date-time-length (CDTL) data of future recordings., 164513=Referring to FIG. 3, which is a schematic illustrating a conceptual structure of the in-use directory 1021 in the data structure of FIG. 2, the in-use directory 1021 stores the directory of the cassette tape currently inserted into the VCR 1. For each program recorded on the cassette tape, a corresponding entry 1041 is set up in the in-use directory 1021. For purposes of illustration, FIG. 3 shows the entry 1041 only for program 1. However, each program similarly has an entry 1041. Each entry 1041 stores a title or program name (PROGRAM) 1042; a program address (LOC) 1043 which stores the absolute tape counter value of the beginning of the program; a program length value (LENGTH) 1044 which stores the length of the recorded program, represented as a function of the difference between its address from the address of the next program or record or a measure of time from a fixed reference point, such as the beginning of the tape; an optional program type field (TYPE) 1045 which stores the category of the recorded program; an optional program audience field (AUDIENCE) 1046 which stores the recommended audience of the program; and an optional recording speed (SPEED) 1047 which stores the speed at which the program is recorded., 586744=With reference to the flow chart in FIG. 84B, the read/write circuit waits in step 2010 for the initiation of a read or a write operation. When a first transition at the control track is detected, the read/write circuit resets and then starts a timer (step 2011). In steps 2012 and 2013, the read/write circuit continues to sample the data track until a transition on the control track is detected., 165878=A current tape location (CURRENT LOC) 1049 is also stored in the directory for indicating the absolute position from the beginning of the tape 42 in the cassette 40 where the valid directory is located, or the value of the tape counter when the tape is ejected. This field is used for setting the tape counter when the tape is reloaded into the VCR 1. The recording on the tape of the absolute tape position is described below., 210111=FIG. 12 is a schematic diagram of another embodiment of the remote controller 1300 for the VCR of FIG. 1. A remote controller 9700 has a plurality of push buttons or keys 9701-9725. A power switch 9701 enables turning power to the VCR 1 on and off. A print button 9702 allows the user to print on hard copy or to disk the directory or other information in the RAM 33. An eject button 9703 is used to eject the cassette 40 from the VCR. A page up button 9704 and a page down button 9705 are used to move up or down pages on the screen. A cancel button 9706 is used to cancel selections made. Channel change buttons 9707 enable toggling the channel selection up and down. A number keypad 9708 is used to enter numbers for commands and selections. An ENTER button 9709 is used to enter channel numbers and menu options in the methods discussed below. A library button 9710 is used to retrieve directories. A VCRPlus+\u2122 button 9711 is used to enter \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d numbers. An index button 9712 is used to enter an index mode., 164254=In addition, the area 1010 also stores a volume number field (VOLNO) 1016 which stores a counter value representing the number of tape directories already stored in the library 1023. Other flags may be added as needed., 311888=FIG. 27 is a schematic view showing the format for a TP packet recorded on the VBI for HR tapes and PR tapes. A TP packet 2603 contains both the TID 2604 and the program number. The TP packet has the following symbols: start code, type, TID, reserved, N, stop code and check sum., 565244=The connectors 2940 on the back panel of the VCR for coupling to the semiconductor memory device 2910 are spring-loaded contact pins so as to allow for movement of the cassette during loading and unloading. Preferably, the springs are chosen such that they assert about 50 grams onto the cassette and would not cause the cassette to be pushed out of its resting plate. The contact area of each pin is substantially equal to 0.05\u2033\ufffd0.05\u2033, with a tolerance of 0.01\u2033 for each dimension., 585494=As write operations are performed in a reverse direction, mirror images 1902\u2032, 1901\u2032 of the mark 1902 and header 1901 respectively are written at the end of the data field 1903 as shown in FIG. 83b. In addition, a parity byte 1904 is provided after the data field 1905 so that the direction of the magnetic field at each end can be determined., 155956=As shown in FIG. 1, caption decoding can be implemented by coupling an input of a VBI signal decoder 60 a to the output of a tuner 61 which is generally included in the majority of consumer VCR's for off-the-air recording. The tuner 61 receives a broadcast TV signal from an antenna 63 or a cable TV signal source 64. Both the decoder, the tuner, and the interaction of both, are conventional in the art. Examples of commercially available VBI caption decoders include the TeleCaption 4000 Adaptor, commercially available from National Caption Institute, Falls Church, Va., and Teletext Decoder, available from Norpak Corporation, Ottawa, Canada. In a specific embodiment of the present invention, the VBI decoder 60 a is a circuit from ITT with part number of CCD3000. The CCD3000 decoder may be set to decode a selected field and line of the VBI by setting a control and status register. Field selection is accomplished by selectively setting bit 4 of the IM BUS control register with a RAM address of 02H. Line selection is accomplished by selectively setting the IM Bus control register a with RAM address of 04H. (See \u201cCCD 3000 Closed-Caption Decoder preliminary\u201d, table 4.2, page 31, Edition Apr. 22, 1991, ITT Semiconductors.) A decoder signal line 65 is coupled from the decoder to the VCR control logic circuit 21 to carry decoded caption data to the control logic circuit. The VCR control logic circuit 21 is commanded by the microprocessor controller 31 to pass the decoded data to the directory 33 a under control of a stored program in the RAM 33. The program then causes the caption information to be stored as a program title in the directory and displayed on the display 50. The VBI data is sent to the RAM 33 during or immediately before the display of an on-screen directory at step 1408 described below for FIG. 35a, so that when the directory is displayed, the caption data immediately appears in the directory display. A user then can edit the caption to adjust it as desired., 112345=In \u201cRecommended Practice For Line 21 Data Services, Part Seven, Extended Data Service Packets\u201d, Draft EIA-608, Oct. 12, 1992, there is suggestion of using VBI line 21, field 2 to send information such as program title and type along with the broadcast program. Yet, the possible use of such information for facilitating operation of a videocassette recorder, such as providing a title for a recorded program, is never suggested., 627527=If an arrow button or the jog shuttle knob is not in operation, control is passed to step 1522 and the system tests whether the \u201center\u201d button 1303 has been pressed. If so, the user desires to freeze and save the current character. Therefore, control is passed to step 1524 in which the current displayed character (and the remainder of the title) are saved in a memory location coupled to the microprocessor controller. The cursor is then advanced to the next available cursor position, if any, as indicated in step 1525. After the cursor is advanced, the current character at that position is displayed; as indicated above, this will be the letter \u201cA\u201d., 617276=The remote shuttle control 1300, the character generator 23, and a control program 33 b stored in the directory controller 30 can be used to create video titles for the program directory. In one embodiment, the methods of FIGS. 91A, 91B are used in connection with an on-screen video display shown in FIG. 90C. The steps shown in FIGS. 90A, 90B are invoked when the system enters steps S11 or S16 of FIG. 87B, step S78 of FIG. 89, step S52 of FIG. 85A, or steps S11, S16 of FIG. 88B. Upon entry of these steps, the system is placed under the control of a stored program coupled to the microprocessor controller 31 containing instructions to implement the steps of FIG. 90A. A menu is displayed at step 1402 and control is passed to step 1404 in which the system tests whether the directory display has been selected. If not, control is passed to step 1406 and the data-entry mode of FIG. 90A is terminated., 322537=On the other hand, if a command to eject the tape is received (Step 9207), the microprocessor controller 31 updates the directory that is stored in the RAM 33, including the current tape location (current LOC) flag 1049 (See FIG. 3) which indicates the absolute address of the location of the tape when the tape is ejected referenced to the beginning of the tape. If the tape is a new blank tape (Step 9209), the microprocessor controller 31 displays on the video display 50 a the tape number of the tape, so that the user can then mark the housing of the cassette 40 with this new number for subsequent identification. The VCR control logic circuit 21 then commands the motor and mechanical control circuit 5 to eject the tape (Step 9212)., 563683=Referring to FIG. 72a, there is shown a semiconductor memory 2910 carried on the back panel of the cassette 2920. A plurality of contacts 2930 are provided on the surface of the semiconductor memory device 2910 for coupling to the microprocessor controller 31 of the directory controller 30. Desirably, the number of contacts between the semiconductor memory device and the VCR is minimized. This is accomplished by using a serial memory, such as a EEPROM from Microchip with part number 24C04-P. By using a serial memory, only one bit is required to input/output address and data. According to a specific implementation, the semiconductor memory 2910 is a serial memory and has four pads for coupling to the microprocessor controller 31, as shown in FIG. 72b. The pads include a pad 2930 a for coupling to a 5 volt voltage supply, a pad 2930 d for coupling to ground, a pad 2930 b for communicating serial address/data signals (SDA) and a pad 2930 c for inputting a serial clock signal (SCL)., 550927=Operation of the motor 2624 is controlled by a stop/go signal applied to the input of circuit 2612 of the circuit 2610. When a high voltage level signal is applied at the input of block 2612, a transistor 2612 a conducts which then turns on a transistor 2612 b and provides a conduction path from the motor., 579952=A lift cam 2512 is pivotally mounted to the member 2508. One arm 2513 of the cam 2512 is coupled by a spring 2514 to the cantilever 2509. In the absence of a cassette, the spring 2514 pulls the arm 2513 of the cam 2512 up, thereby lifting the head 2501. When a cassette is inserted, it pushes the other arm 2515 of the cam 2512, thereby lowering the arm 2513 and allowing the head 2501 to drop onto the magnetic strip on the cassette., 499556=In a specific implementation, enough memory space is provided in the CDTL buffer 1024 for storing eight \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number settings. Referring to FIG. 59f, when the microprocessor controller 31 is interrupted by the VCR PLUS+\u2122 key (step 2751), it first checks whether the CDTL buffer 1024 is full (step 27520). If the buffer is not full, the microprocessor controller 31 displays a screen, such as FIG. 60g, on the television screen (step 2752). The microprocessor controller 31 then waits for an input from the user (step 2753). If the input is a number key (step 2754), it is added to the entered digits (step 2755). If the input is the ERASE key (step 2756), the already-received digits are erased (step 2757). If the input is the ENTER key (step 2758), the microprocessor controller 31 checks whether the input is a valid \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number (step 2759)., 553617=When data is applied to the input of circuit 2630, it causes the current source 2633 to output a current through write winding 2640 of a write head 16 when enabled through a transistor 2641 and a switch 2642. Depending on the value of the write enable signal, the current from the current source 2633 flows to the write head 16 to cause magnetization of the magnetic strip 150. The direction of magnetization is dependent upon the direction of the current from the current source 2633, which in turn is dependent upon the voltage level of the data input., 105053=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/066,666, filed May 27, 1993., 510132=In step 2777, the assigned volume number is displayed on the screen, accompanied by a message such as:, 587725=For better accuracy, steps 2012-2014 can be repeated for N times so that average values of Tl and Tc can be obtained. A calibration value, which equals to Tl/Tc, is calculated (step 2016)., 628229=If \u201cENTER\u201d has not been pressed, control is passed to step 1526, in which the system tests whether the menu button 1304 has been pressed. If not, control is passed back to step 1512. If so, the user desires to save the entire title. Therefore, control is passed to step 1528 in which the entire displayed title is saved into one of the program title locations of the directory 33 a in the RAM 33. Entry of a title is then complete and control terminates at step 1530., 318964=FIG. 28 is a schematic diagram showing the TID for an HR tape. The TID 2604 is a 5 byte number. Bit 39 and bits 38-31 are 0. Bits 30-16 are the machine ID. Bits 15-0 are the tape number. As described above, the 15 bit machine ID is a random number generated by the indexing VCR 10 at its first power up. This provides a 1 in 32,768 probability that two indexing VCRs have identical machine IDs. A 16 bit tape number allows each indexing VCR 10 to have 65,536 tapes stored in the RAM 33. Alternatively, the tape number may be composed of a different number of bits., 572652=An eight-bit checksum 2968 is recorded after the last record of the directory for data integrity verification., 502359=If the CDTL buffer 1024 is already full when the \u201cVCR Plus+\u2122\u201d key is pressed, a warning screen such as FIG. 60j is displayed (step 27521). The warning screen advises the user that the buffer is full and that he needs to delete a program from the buffer before another program can be added. Under FIG. 60j, the user is advised that he review the list of programs stored in the CDTL buffer 1024 so that he/she can delete one or more setting to make room for the new setting. The user is also advised that he can press the \u201cCANCEL\u201d key to exit \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number recording., 602086=Assume a directory exists in the RAM 33. In block S26, the microprocessor controller 31 causes the CURRENT LOC value 1049 (see FIG. 2) in the RAM 33 to be updated with the current tape location value in the position logic and counter circuit 9. During blocks S27 and S28, the microprocessor controller 31 causes the VCR control logic circuit 21 and the motor and mechanical control circuit 5 to start moving the tape 42 in a forward direction. During block S27, the microprocessor controller 31 causes the VCR control logic circuit 21 and the control and audio track head logic circuit 11 to record a single marker on the control track 42 c where the directory is stored on the tape 42. During block S28, the microprocessor controller 31 causes the directory from the RAM 33 to be recorded onto the control track 42 c of the tape 42 in close proximity to the marker. During block S29, the microprocessor controller 31 causes the control and audio track head logic circuit 11 and the motor and mechanical control circuit 5 to rewind slightly to a position before the directory. Thereafter during block S30, the microprocessor controller 31 causes the motor and mechanical control circuit 5 to eject the cassette tape 40 from the VCR 1., 626096=When a new title is being entered, after the display of FIG. 91B is shown, control is passed to step 1510 of FIG. 91A. The cursor 50 m is moved to the first (leftmost) position of the on-screen title. Control is next passed to step 1512 to display the current character at that location. Initially, the current character will be \u201cA\u201d, which will appear in the leftmost position of the title. Control is passed to step 1514 in which the system tests whether an arrow button or the jog shuttle knob has been moved. If so, control is passed to step 1516. If the current character is \u201cZ\u201d or \u201cA\u201d, special processing is required. If the current character is \u201cZ\u201d, and the right button was pressed, then the cursor is changed to \u201cA\u201d. Likewise, if the current character is \u201cA\u201d, and the left button is pressed, the current cursor changes to \u201cZ\u201d. These steps are effected in step 1518. Otherwise, control is passed to step 1520 in which the current character is incremented or decremented depending on whether the left or right buttons (or jog shuttle knob) have been pressed. Thereafter, control is passed to step 1512 to display the current cursor. In real time, the user sees the character at the current cursor position rapidly change from \u201cA\u201d through each letter of the alphabet as long as an arrow button or the jog shuttle knob is being operated., 301054=FIG. 26 is a schematic view showing the format for the directory packet D(0) for the tape title recorded in the VBI for prerecorded tapes. A D(0) data packet 2602 has the following symbols in order: start code, type, N, length, reserve, reel diameter, reserved, version, language, title text, expand byte, stop code and checksum., 565760=As illustrated in FIGS. 72a and 72 b, the memory device 2910 is placed in the specific implementation in the recessed label area 2931 on the back panel of the cassettes, which has an area of 0.08\u2033\ufffd1.5\u2033. In the specific implementation, the thickness of the memory device is 0.062\u2033. The separation between the bottom edges of the conductor pads 2930 and the bottom edge of the memory device 2910 is 0.1\u2033. A separation of 0.1\u2033 is provided between the left edge of the memory device 2910 and the left edge of the left-most conductor pad 2930 a. A separation of 0.1\u2033 is provided between the right edge of the memory device 2910 and the right edge of the right-most conductor pad 2930 d., 618335=Otherwise, control passes to step 1408 in which the directory display 32 e is shown on the video screen from the caption data sent to the directory during or immediately before the display of the directory. Thus, the caption data immediately appears in the directory display. The user then may edit the caption to adjust it as desired. The display may take the form of FIG. 90C, comprising a representation of an alphabetic keyboard 50 b in the upper portion of the screen, and a video title 50 g in the lower portion. The keyboard representation 50 d resembles a standard QWERTY-style typewriter keyboard. A plurality of rows 50 e are displayed, each including a plurality of single characters 50 f. The characters 50 f match the labels of the standard typewriter keys in a QWERTY-layout keyboard. Initially, the title 50 g is entirely blank. If desired, the character spaces available for filling with a title can be represented by adjacent squares or rectangles as shown in FIG. 90C., 207936=An exemplary remote control unit is the Remote Commander provided with the above-identified Sony VCR. FIG. 11 illustrates an embodiment of a remote control unit 1300. The unit 1300 comprises a hand-held housing 1322 provided with a plurality of push buttons 1301-1319. A remote jog shuttle knob 1320 is provided for hand-held operation of the jog shuttle feature of the VCR. A command mode selector switch 1301 enables activating the control unit. A plurality of channel number buttons 1302 enable remote entry of channel numbers. An ENTER button 1303 is used to enter channel numbers and menu options in the methods discussed below. A menu button 1304 is used to display a menu of user options, as discussed below. A plurality of cursor movement buttons 1305, each marked with an arrow, is used to move an on-screen cursor in various menu operations. An antenna TV/VTR button 1306 is used to command the video display 50 to display a signal coming either from an antenna or the output of the VCR 1. A power switch 1307 enables turning power to the VCR 1 on and off. A TV/VTR switch 1308 enables selectively using the remote control unit to control the VCR 1 or the video display 50. An input select button 1309 enables selection of the source to be recorded. Channel change buttons 1310 enable toggling the channel selection up and down. Similarly, volume buttons 1311 enable toggling the volume louder or softer. A record mode button 1312 enables selection of recording tape speed. A timer clear button 1313 is used to clear timer settings of the VCR. A timer record button 1314 is used to enter a timer recording mode. An index button 1315 is used to enter an index mode. Other buttons 1316-1319 can be used to control various functions on the VCR, including the direction, speed, and mode of the tape transport. The functions and implementation of each button are well known in the art, and have been commercially embodied in the above-mentioned Sony VCR., 500883=If the \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number is valid at step 2759, a check is made to determine whether there is a \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number conflicts (step 27516). A conflict occurs when the \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number setting is for a recording which will occur at the same time as another scheduled recording. Referring to FIG. 59g, if there is no conflict, a prompt screen such as FIG. 60i is displayed (step 27511). The user can then press:, 470018=One example of scrambling and de-scrambling is to apply the 7 bits to pairs of alpha numeric characters in the data and depending upon whether the bit is one or a zero, swap the characters. For example, where a one digit appears the characters of the pair are swapped, where a zero appears, the characters are not swapped. For example, for a seven bit sequence of 1011001, the phrase CHRISTIE PARKER HALE becomes scrambled by switching the C and H of the first character pair to read HC for the first one in the seven bit sequence. The RI is not swapped because the second bit is a zero; the ST is swapped to TS because the third bit is a 1; the IE is swapped to read EI because the fourth bit is 1; and so forth. In addition, the pattern is repeated for each set of seven pairs. Spaces are included as a character. Thus, CHRISTIE PARKER HALE becomes HCRITSEI PAREK RHAEL. By applying the same seven bit sequence 1011001, the character sequence can be de-scrambled., 630455=The flow chart in FIGS. 92a, 92 b show additional options that are provided to a user when a directory is available. FIGS. 92a-92 b are steps that specifically relate to a system which uses a stationary head to access directory information from a magnetic strip. Counterpart flow charts for a system which has a moving head or a semiconductor memory are shown in FIGS. 93a and 93 b. When the user actuates the cursor movement keys, step 1801 is entered. A pointer is provided in the microprocessor controller 31 to point to the directory 33 a at the entry (or a field within an entry) identified by the cursor; when the cursor movement keys are actuated, this pointer moves correspondingly (step 1802)., 552306=Similarly, when the input signal is high (REV), a current is passed through the motor 2624 in a left-to-right direction, causing the motor 2624 to rotate in the opposite direction., 582896=In step 2003, the read/write circuit waits for the next transition on the control track to occur. When a transition occurs, the value of the timer is registered and then restarted (step 2004). In step 2005, the read/write circuit delays for a time period equal to half the timer value registered in step 2004., 481709=If the cassette is an enhanced cassette, the feature control field FTCNTL 1013 in the operation flags of the RAM 33 is filled. Other control parameters, such as the length of the cassette tape 1012, and access parameters (e.g. bit density of a magnetic strip) of the secondary memory is read and stored in appropriate fields in the operation flags (step 2712)., 515795=The use of the auxiliary information is now illustrated with reference to FIG. 62. Assume that a network 3201 is broadcasting a prime time movie. At certain intermissions of the movie, the network introduces an upcoming program (e.g. a miniseries). Assuming that the upcoming show will be broadcasted for three consecutive days starting two weeks later (say, January 1) and will be broadcast at 9:00 pm for two hours each day. Normally, excerpts of miniseries are shown during the intermissions. When the excerpts 3202 are broadcasted, the VBI 3203 of the broadcasted signals would contain the CDTL or \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number information of the miniseries. The CDTL information or the \u201cPLUSCODE\u2122\u201d number can be put, for example, in the composite packet-1 (i.e. line 21, field 2, control code=01, type code=0C). A mark, such as a character \u201cI\u201d 3204 flashing at the lower right hand corner of the screen 3205, is shown when the excerpts are shown. The flashing \u201cI\u201d 3204 informs a user that, if the user is interested in recording the miniseries, he can press an I-key and the VCR will be automatically set to record the miniseries using the information broadcasted in the VBI. The VCR indicates to the user that the information has been stored by either stopping the flashing of the \u201cI\u201d or by displaying a message, such as \u201cSAVED\u201d on the screen. Other prompts and the variations in the timing relationship with the program may be used as described above for auxiliary information., 561487=Another method of preformatting the feature mark is to selectively coat portions 3072 of the header which contain a \u201c1\u201d with magnetizable material as shown in FIG. 70g. The portions 3071 of the header which contain a \u201c0\u201d are not coated. The selective coating can be accomplished using a mask of printing plate containing the desired pattern. When the cassette is inserted into the VCR, a write operation is performed on the header. After the write operation is completed, those portions which are coated with magnetizable material are magnetized, as shown in FIG. 70h). The header is then read into FTCNTL 1013 field 1013., 554978=The differential outputs from the differential amplifier 2651 are received by a second amplifier 2652 which converts them to a single-ended output. The output from amplifier 2652 is received by a differentiator circuit 2653 which operates to detect the peaks of the signals from the magnetic sensor 154. The output of the differentiator circuit 2653 is applied to a digital buffer 2654., 163530=In a preferred embodiment, a library 1023 is also provided in the RAM 33. The library 1023 stores directories of tapes which users of the VCR 1 have archived. Each directory stored in the library contains substantially the same information as the in-use directory. If a library is present, a library pointer 1015 is provided for pointing to the library 1023., 552520=Data is written onto the magnetic strip by a write circuit 2630 schematically illustrated in FIG. 68. The write circuit 2630 comprises a first amplifier circuit 2631 for amplifying the input signal. The amplifier circuit 2631 has an R-C feedback for improving response. A block 2632 is a second amplifier circuit coupled to the first amplifier circuit through a variable resistor 2638. The variable resistor 2638 is provided to adjust the magnitude of the write current. The output of the second amplifier circuit 2632 drives a current source circuit 2633. The current source circuit 2633 has two capacitors 2634, 2635. When the input voltage to the circuit 2633 changes, these capacitors help to pull/push the voltage received at the respective inputs of transistors 2636, 2637, thereby improving the response time of the circuit. The four diodes within the circuit 2633 are provided to equalize the base voltage of the transistors 2636, 2637.}",
