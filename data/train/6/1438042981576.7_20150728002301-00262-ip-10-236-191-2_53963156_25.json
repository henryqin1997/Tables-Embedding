The drive stalled at the San Diego 10, and Santos hit a 28-yard field goal from a 10-7 lead with 3:13 left in the first half., 74506=The Chargers responded with a 12-play, 77-yard drive that was capped off by a 24-yard field goal from Novak with 9:36 to play. The big play of the march was a 14-yard catch from Malcom Floyd on 3rd-and-14, with Kansas City challenging the spot but seeing the ruling on the field standing to give San Diego a first down.}",
