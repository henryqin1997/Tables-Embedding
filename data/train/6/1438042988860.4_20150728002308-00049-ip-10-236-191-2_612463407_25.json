    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{734=Of course, the naysayers will point to Thomas' maddeningly inconsistent tape and scattershot accuracy as reasons for bypassing the Virginia Tech standout, but I would point out that the NFL is a developmental league. Thus, I'm more concerned with Thomas' natural talent, athleticism and football IQ as a possible late-round pick. Measuring 6-foot-6 and 248 pounds, Thomas is an impressive athlete with physical traits that are comparable to 2011 No. 1 overall pick Cam Newton., 2593=Drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the second round of the 1994 NFL Draft, Bucky Brooks played for five different teams (Buffalo, Jacksonville, Green Bay, Kansas City and Oakland) in five NFL seasons. After his playing career was over in 1999, Brooks joined the Seattle Seahawks' pro personnel department as a regional college scout. He served in the same capacity for the Carolina Panthers from 2003 to 2007, before joining Sports Illustrated as a football analyst. He joined NFL Media in 2009., 1775=Posted: April 23, 2014 at 11:15 a.m.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{5350=I'm not suggesting Thomas is a playmaker of Newton's caliber, but it's important to note that several observers viewed the Virginia Tech standout as a first-round talent after his sensational sophomore year that saw him pass for 3,000-plus yards with a 19:10 touchdown-to-interception ratio, while tallying 11 rushing touchdowns. The big-bodied playmaker was so impressive guiding the Hokies' offense during the season that most expected him to challenge for the top overall spot in the 2013 draft, if he played up to his potential as a junior., 94943=That's why I hold onto the notion that Lee will be a big-time playmaker at the next level. He was so impressive during his first two seasons that I'm willing to keep his dismal junior season in perspective. Lee struggled recovering from a knee injury; he never fully displayed the speed and burst that made him nearly impossible to defend on the perimeter. Additionally, Lee had a tough time getting the ball consistently due to questionable quarterback play. Although he dropped his fair share of passes over the course of the 2013 season, there's no doubt that his production was greatly affected by the departure of Matt Barkley. That's why I believe scouts and coaches would be wise to examine Lee's full body of work when comparing him to Watkins and some of the other receivers in the 2014 class., 229792=The 2014 NFL Draft features the deepest and most talented collection of wide receivers that I've seen in more than a decade. Teams looking for big-bodied pass catchers or explosive \"catch and run\" playmakers will be able to find their guys at every stage of the draft. I believed this group was special when I graded them individually during the regular season; that belief was confirmed when I watched them work out at the NFL Scouting Combine., 269023=For instance, the 2014 wide receiver class features as many as seven or eight guys worthy of receiving first-round grades. Thus, teams can wait on taking a receiver early because a comparable receiver could be available in the second round., 325462=Posted: March 2, 2014 at 1 p.m., 150881=That's why I believe it's the perfect time to examine Blaine Gabbert and his failures with the Jacksonville Jaguars after being touted as a potential franchise quarterback in the 2011 class. Of course, it's easy to point out the flaws of the player in hindsight, but I believe it's necessary to review previous reports to see if we ignored glaring red flags on a player during the pre-draft process. Additionally, it is important to examine the team's role in the disappointment to determine if a change of scenery would produce a better result down the road. Here's are my observations:, 118834=Interestingly, the average height of defensive backs remains under 6-foot, while the average wide receiver measured in at 6-0 1/2\" at the event. Perusing the top-rated defensive backs in the 2014 class, it is not a coincidence that each measures at or above the standard dimensions established by most NFL teams., 27905=Oh, I know there has been a lot of interest and speculation about Thomas switching to tight end as a pro. Although Thomas was rated as the No. 1 tight end prospect coming out of high school in 2009, it's tough to make a position change at the NFL level. First, Thomas must fully embrace making a position change and diligently work to master the nuances of a new position on the practice field. While Thomas certainly possesses the athletic attributes to thrive at the position, he hasn't expressed a desire to make a move to tight end nor has he worked out as a tight end in public workouts. Thus, any team considering Thomas as a tight end prospect must vet the prospect to see if he would enthusiastically make the change before pulling the trigger on the Virginia Tech standout with a late-round selection., 262773=Posted: March 5, 2014 at 11:52 a.m., 82738=Posted: March 23, 2014 at 2:50 p.m., 222643=Scout's Take: Ebron is unquestionably one of the most explosive playmakers in the 2014 draft. He set a new ACC record for receiving yards by a tight end (895), while terrorizing opponents with his freakish athleticism. Measuring 6-4, 250 pounds, Ebron moves like a wide receiver, yet possesses the body of a basketball power forward. Given his agility, balance and body control, I believe the computer correctly selected a group of players with similar skills sets. Cook and Cameron are Pro Bowl-caliber players, but I foresee Ebron become an elite player at the position early in his career., 180412=The team desperately needs to acquire a young quarterback with elite talent to legitimately compete in the AFC, yet the 2014 quarterback class doesn't offer a \"can't-miss\" prospect at the position. While I believe Teddy Bridgewater, Johnny Manziel and eventually Blake Bortles could develop into solid starting quarterbacks in the NFL, there are certainly questions about whether each prospect possesses enough blue-chip characteristics (size, arm talent and leadership skills) to be considered at the top of the board., 113962=Posted: March 15, 2014 at 7:37 a.m., 93441=It's a foregone conclusion that Sammy Watkins will be the first wide receiver taken in the draft, but I'm not convinced that he is the top playmaker in the 2014 class., 124462=Scout's Take: The first thing that stands out to me when viewing this list is the size/speed combination of the top cornerbacks in the class. That three prospects clocked sub-4.4 times in the 40 suggests they are capable of running with speedsters on the perimeter. Additionally, the impressive vertical jumps confirm the explosiveness and athleticism needed to battle big-bodied receivers on 50-50 balls. Factoring in the adequate arm length of each defender, the top cornerbacks in the 2014 class possess the size to match up with big pass catchers dominating the league. Of course, there are some teams that will have reservations about Verrett's size as a potential starter, but his exceptional short-area quickness (see three-cone time) should make him an ideal nickel corner, which enhances his value on some draft boards., 318432=Interesting note: Manziel weighed 207 pounds at the combine, which would make him the lightest quarterback drafted in the first round since 2003 if he is taken on May 8th., 332540=Posted: March 1, 2014 at 7:52 a.m., 282018=Without a clear-cut first-rounder in the 2014 running back class, I thought it was a good time to check out NFL Insight's comparisons to see if any of these runners has the potential to become a dominant player as a pro. While the computer will spit out pro comps based on physical dimensions and measurements, I prefer to rely on a combination of film study, statistical analysis and intuition to determine whether a player has the goods to excel at the next level., 193369=Posted: March 8, 2014 at 7:46 a.m., 187272=Posted: March 8, 2014 at 7:30 p.m., 307744=Posted: March 3, 2014 at 4:15 p.m., 93357=Posted: March 20, 2014 at 1:30 p.m., 36561=Overall, I know that Carey's speed and character should play a role in his final evaluation, but I've been around the NFL long enough to know talent outweighs everything on draft day. Given Carey's production and natural running skills, I believe he should be in the conversation as one of the top running backs in the 2014 class, despite a slow 40-time that has scouts second-guessing their evaluations from the fall., 93627=Now, I know I'm the lone wolf in that assessment, but I remember the numerous accolades and honors hurled in USC WR Marqise Lee's direction a season ago. In case you forgot, Lee was touted as the most electrifying player in college football after tallying 118 receptions for 1,721 yards with 14 touchdowns in 2012. He finished the season with 2,683 all-purpose yards and averaged 16.7 yards every time he touched the ball. Those numbers certainly jump off the stat sheet, but it was his big-play ability (16 plays of 40-plus yards in 2012, including 11 of 50-plus yards and 7 of 70-plus yards) that separated Lee from a talented collection of playmakers in college football., 255792=Scout's Take: Lee is coming off a disappointing final season at USC, but scouts are keenly aware of his dynamic playmaking ability based on his first two seasons as a Trojan. Lee is one of the best athletes in the draft, exhibiting outstanding explosiveness in drills at the NFL Scouting Combine. Looking at the film, Lee is dynamite with the ball in his hands in the open field. Comparing Lee to the players mentioned on this list, Lee falls in line with Brown and Wright as a playmaker. Both guys are terrific \"catch and run\" playmakers, with the speed to take it the distance in the open field., 78859=If I had to point out one guy to watch moving forward, I would suggest keeping an eye on Arizona's Ka'Deem Carey. The Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year amassed 3,814 rushing yards and 42 touchdowns on the ground from 2012-2013, displaying a relentless running style that is ideal for the pro game. While scouts have seemingly taken him to task for his pedestrian 40-yard dash time, Carey displays the vision, instincts and short-area burst frequently displayed by the most effective runners in the NFL., 158440=From a personnel standpoint, the Jaguars didn't add enough weaponry to help Gabbert succeed. To be fair, the Jaguars attempted to land a No. 1 receiver by selecting Justin Blackmon with the fifth overall pick of the 2012 draft, but the talented pass catcher has missed parts of the past two seasons battling a host of off-field issues. Additionally, the Jaguars misfired in free agency when Laurent Robinson failed to live up to the hype as a big play receiver. Without a big-time target to lean on in the passing game, Gabbert struggled finding his way as a passer and playmaker in Jacksonville., 281079=Although I continue to believe the presence of strong running game remains essential to winning games, the facts support the notion that elite running backs can be found at every stage of the draft. Three of the last five regular-season rushing champions were drafted outside of the first round, including LeSean McCoy (Round 2, 2009), Maurice Jones-Drew (Round 2, 2006) and Arian Foster (undrafted free agent, 2009). And five out of the top six rushers in 2013 were drafted outside of Round 1, including McCoy, Jamaal Charles, Matt Forte, Alfred Morris and DeMarco Murray., 161193=Posted: March 11, 2014 at 11:35 a.m., 277845=The devaluation of the running back position in the NFL was officially confirmed in the 2013 NFL Draft when no running backs were selected in the first round for the first time in 50 years., 107486=Posted: March 18, 2014 at 3:03 p.m., 96469=Sure, he should be applauded for his spectacular junior campaign that saw him re-emerge as one of the top players in college football, but a look at his entire body of work suggests that his sub-par year is eerily similar to Lee's 2013 when examined in its proper context (Watkins snagged 57 passes for 708 yards and three scores in 2012; Lee finished with 57 receptions for 791 yards and four touchdowns in 2013). Like Lee, Watkins labored through a difficult season during his collegiate career where his production didn't match his immense talent and potential. Yet, he was able to bounce back a year later and play to the level of expectation. Lee could orchestrate a similar turnaround as a healthy pro and provide a team with the kind of production we witnessed in 2012 when he was healthy and at his best., 194151=Looking at the 2014 offensive tackle class, I believe there are three prospects -- Jake Matthews, Greg Robinson and Taylor Lewan -- with the tools to develop into dominant players at the next level. Each prospect is an extraordinary athlete with body control and quickness to thrive on the edges. Yet, they also display the strength and power to crush defenders with their physicality and toughness. Factor in their sound technical skills, and it's not a surprise scouts are excited about their long-term potential in the NFL., 186299=Looking at draft implications, the Texans would likely lose their second-round pick, but gain the services of a young quarterback with more potential than any quarterback in the 2014 class. Additionally, the retention of the No. 1 overall pick would allow the team to select Jadeveon Clowney to fortify a defense that is already regarded as one of the best in the league., 324777=Interesting note: Bortles (4.93) would be one of the slowest quarterbacks taken in the first two rounds of the draft since 2003., 72744=Looking at my most recent list of the top five running backs in the 2014 draft, I believe each of the guys has displayed the talent and potential to thrive as primary runners., 312520=With that as a backdrop, I would like to play a game of man vs. computer over the next couple of weeks to test my evaluation skills against NFL Insight. I will analyze the pro comparisons on a handful of prospects that the computer spit out, and let you know where it was right and where it went wrong. Given the importance of the quarterback position, I believe it is only right that we start with two of the top quarterbacks in the 2014 class, Johnny Manziel and Blake Bortles, to see what past prospects they're connected to based on their combine test results., 116276=Looking ahead to the draft, the trend will certainly continue with a class of big, athletic defenders comprising the bulk of the 2014 defensive class. Here are the average dimensions and measurements of the 59 defensive backs that participated in the NFL Combine:, 215548=Posted: March 6, 2014 at 6:22 p.m., 5913=Although Thomas didn't match the production or performance of his breakout season in subsequent years, he isn't a throwaway at the position based on his arm talent, athleticism and developmental potential. He flashed promise running a more traditional offense in 2013, exhibiting improved pocket presence and anticipation directing a vertical passing attack. Sure, there were plenty of questionable decisions and inaccurate throws, but every quarterback viewed as a Day 3 (Rounds 4-7) prospect has warts on their respective games. Thus, a patient quarterback coach adept at polishing footwork and fundamentals could clean up Thomas' game and help the big-bodied playmaker develop into a quality starter down the road., 66409=As a member of the Carolina Panthers' front office, I was part of a team that frequently expended top picks on running backs in the draft to ensure our backfield rotation was loaded with young, athletic runners with the skills to handle a heavy workload (20-plus carries) against stout defenses. John Fox believed running the ball was essential to building a championship team -- we went to Super Bowl XXXVIII and made a subsequent appearance in the 2005 NFC Championship Game with a punishing running game paving the way. Looking back at the draft selections of DeShaun Foster (second round; 2002), DeAngelo Williams (first round; 2006) and Jonathan Stewart (first round; 2008), it's obvious that we believed building around the running back gave us the best chance to consistently win at a high level., 114046=The presence of big-bodied receivers in the NFL has led scouts and coaches to covet big, athletic defensive backs at a premium. Teams looking to match up with the likes of Calvin Johnson, A.J. Green, Julio Jones, Larry Fitzgerald and others are making it mandatory for their scouts to scour the college ranks for defensive backs that measure 5-foot-11 or taller in the 2014 class., 29465=During my time scouting with the Carolina Panthers, I made the mistake of allowing the stopwatch to dictate my thoughts on a prospect's playing speed and pro potential when I changed my grade on Brandon Browner -- who went on to become a Pro Bowl CB -- after watching him post a pedestrian 40-time (4.63) at the combine. Despite grading Browner as a second-round talent based on my film study on the school visit, I changed my final grade after his disappointing workout in Indianapolis. While I wasn't alone in my assessment (Browner went undrafted in 2005 largely because of his questionable speed), I always regretted not sticking with my guns when he emerged as a Pro Bowl player in Seattle., 168141=Scout's Take: I found it interesting that NFL Insight compared the top prospect in the 2014 class with a couple of enigmatic defenders with freakish athleticism and physical tools. Jason Pierre-Paul and Carlos Dunlap were undoubtedly two of the top defensive ends in the 2010 draft, but questions about their experience (Pierre-Paul only played one season at South Florida) and character (Dunlap was arrested for a DUI prior to the SEC Championship Game; scouts had reservations about his motor after spotting him taking a few plays off in big games) led to several teams dropping them down their respective draft boards. However, both guys have silenced the skeptics questioning their games by posting solid numbers as pass rushers (Dunlap has 27.5 sacks; Pierre-Paul has 29.5 sacks). With Clowney sporting similar physical dimensions and athletic characteristics, the comparisons to Pierre-Paul stand out to me due to his dominance as an edge rusher for the New York Giants. He notched 16.5 sacks in his second season; he showcased a dizzying array of moves at the line of scrimmage that made him nearly impossible to block off the edges. Although injuries have kept Pierre-Paul from playing at a Pro Bowl level the past two seasons, coaches and scouts still view the Giants star as an elite rusher in the league. If Clowney can up the energy and effort in his play, there's no reason why he shouldn't surpass Pierre-Paul on the way to becoming the league's premier pass rusher., 150344=Posted: March 12, 2014 at 7:33 p.m., 62340=The devaluation of the running back position in the NFL has been widely reported over the past few seasons, but it wasn't until I conducted the NFL.com 2005 NFL Draft Do-Over presented by Under Armour that the change in appreciation for the position stood out to me in such stark terms. In that draft, three running backs were selected in the top five, with Ronnie Brown (Miami), Cedric Benson (Chicago) and Cadillac Williams (Tampa Bay) expected to become franchise backs for their respective teams., 51938=Looking at the 2014 WR class, I believe there are several big-bodied receivers with the size-strength combinations needed to dominate the NFL. Texas A&M's Mike Evans and Florida State's Kelvin Benjamin are frequently cited as the crown jewels of the class due to their superior physical dimensions and on-field dominance. Evans, in particular, is an extraordinary playmaker with a game that is ideally suited to excel at the pro level. He played a key role in Johnny Manziel's success as an improvisational playmaker by routinely coming down with contested balls in a crowd., 95814=Speaking of Watkins, I find it interesting that he has been anointed the cream of the crop, but a season ago we had our own doubts about his game after watching him suffer through a sub-par sophomore season that included a two-game suspension for an off-field incident (Watkins was arrested in May, 2012 and charged with possession of a controlled substance and simple possession of marijuana). While NFL scouts have certainly vetted Watkins' character during the pre-draft process, the questionable effort, preparation and focus that plagued his game in 2012 has rarely been introduced into conversations about his long-term potential., 236389=Scout's Take: Watkins has emerged as the No. 1 receiver in the draft after totaling 1,464 yards on 101 catches with 12 touchdowns in 2013. Those numbers are certainly remarkable, but they pale in comparison to the exceptional skills that Watkins displays as an explosive playmaker with the ball in his hands. The Clemson star is a rare speedster capable of making plays on vertical throws or converting short passes into big gains. Looking at the list of comparisons, Watkins is already a more complete receiver than Mike Wallace at this stage of his career. He is not as explosive (see times in the 40-yard dash and short shuttles, plus the vertical jump), but he is a more polished route runner and displays better hands. Williams and Randle have shown flashes, but neither is a valid comparison based on their skills., 181238=That's why the Texans' potential move to acquire Mallett makes sense for a team trying to return to the ranks of the elite in the AFC. The third-year pro is a classic dropback passer who would likely rank as the top quarterback in this class based on his size, arm talent and production at Arkansas during his final season. In fact, you could argue that he should have been the second or third quarterback taken in the 2011 draft, if character concerns didn't cloud his evaluation. Mallett was a better pure passer than Jake Locker, Christian Ponder and Blaine Gabbert by a considerable margin; he demonstrated more blue-chip characteristics than Andy Dalton throughout his collegiate career., 229709=Posted: March 5, 2014 at 4:42 p.m., 330650=During my time with the Carolina Panthers, I watched John Fox and Marty Hurney take a similar approach with Julius Peppers. The eight-time Pro Bowler was regarded as a mercurial talent with a questionable motor when he entered the NFL in 2002, but the Panthers believed their locker-room culture and coaching staff would bring out the best in Peppers. The no-nonsense coaching styles of Mike Trgovac, Sal Sunseri and Jack Del Rio (who left Carolina after Peppers' rookie season) pushed Peppers to excel, helping him earn the Defensive Rookie of the Year Award at season's end. Additionally, the presence of veteran leaders Brentson Buckner and Mike Rucker created an environment of accountability in the meeting room that prompted Peppers to raise his level of performance to fit in with the group., 37056=Posted: April 8, 2014 at 12:16 p.m., 185379=Although Mallett hasn't had many opportunities to showcase his talents as a pro in regular-season action, scouts have been impressed with his arm talent, pocket presence and leadership skills when studying his performance in the preseason. From the Texans' perspective, Mallett is intriguing because he is familiar with Bill O'Brien's offensive system and he has spent three seasons acclimating to the NFL as Tom Brady's backup. Of course, that doesn't guarantee success as a potential starter, but the fact that O'Brien played an integral role in evaluating and developing Mallett during his time in New England (they spent the 2011 season together with the Patriots) could help the third-year pro hit the ground running as a starter in Houston., 62258=Posted: March 30, 2014 at 11 a.m., 176919=Posted: March 9, 2014 at 10:20 a.m., 162092=Looking ahead to the 2014 class of defensive tackles and defensive ends, there are a handful of prospects with the potential to overwhelm opponents with their size, strength and athleticism. While I could certainly rattle off a handful of names worthy of an extensive study, I thought taking a look at Jadeveon Clowney and Aaron Donald -- the top prospects at each position -- would allow the computer to spit out some interesting comparisons to discuss. NFL Insight certainly didn't disappoint in the latest installment of Man vs. Machine., 338900=Posted: Feb. 28, 2014 at 01:31 p.m., 70675=Studying the draft trends from the past few seasons, the philosophy of building around the running back has greatly diminished as more teams take pass-first approaches with the quarterback viewed as the marquee playmaker. Last year, no running back was drafted in the first round for the first time since 1964. While that development was certainly understandable due to the lackluster results of the first-round running backs selected since 2008, the fact remains that top running backs are still critical to a winning offensive formula despite their diminishing value on draft boards., 216065=That's why teams are intent on finding the next Jimmy Graham or Rob Gronkowski to anchor their passing game for the next few years. With a 2014 class that features a host of big-bodied pass catchers with explosive speed and quickness, coaches are salivating about the possibility of adding a game changer to the line up. Looking at the crop of tight ends set to enter the league, I'm intrigued by the talent and potential of North Carolina's Eric Ebron and Texas Tech's Jace Amaro. Both are dominant players within their respective conferences, exhibiting the athleticism, toughness and ball skills that are key to succeeding in the NFL., 277762=Posted: March 4, 2014 at 3:49 p.m., 133190=Posted: March 14, 2014 at 9:03 a.m., 394335=\u00a9 2015 NFL Enterprises LLC.

NFL footage \u00a9 NFL Productions LLC., 35877=I must acknowledge Carey's character concerns possibly playing a role in his ranking on some boards. He faced an assortment of charges stemming from a domestic violence incident in 2012. Although the chargers were eventually dropped, Carey's involvement in that incident created concerns about his personality and behavior in the minds of evaluators. He also was kicked out of a basketball game in 2013 after a run-in with a police officer. It is possible that his slide down the charts is due to his behavioral issues. (Carlos Hyde and Jeremy Hill must also have to address some character issues to maintain their lofty rankings on draft boards around the league.), 41868=Posted: April 1, 2014 at 11:10 a.m., 192228=Now, I will be the first to point out that Lynch will face an uphill climb to make a roster following a position switch, but his ability to contribute as a playmaker on special teams could buy him enough time to master the nuances of the position while making contributions as an active player. I underwent a similar transition when I moved from wide receiver to defensive back with the Green Bay Packers in 1996, but my ability to contribute as a kick returner and versatile special-teams defender allowed me to hold a spot on the roster until I was capable of making my mark as a defender., 311216=That's why I initially resisted taking on a project that asked me to examine player comparisons based solely on NFL Insight, a statistical database developed by the NFL that examines data at the NFL Scouting Combine since 2003. While I certainly believe statistical analysis should play a role in evaluating players, I don't believe the numbers can accurately portray a prospect's talent or potential without factoring in key variables (scheme, opponent, weather conditions, etc.) that ultimately affect performance. I also believe the impact of pre-combine training has skewed the measurements in several drills, namely the 40-yard dash, pro-agility shuttle and three-cone drill. Thus, the combine numbers are no longer indicative of a prospect's pure speed or athleticism on the field., 213881=Scout's Take: Lewan was considered one of the top offensive tackles in the 2014 class heading into the NFL Combine, but a sensational performance in Indianapolis has vaulted him into the discussion as a possible top 10 pick. His rise up the charts has been fueled by an appreciation for his solid game on tape, but the remarkable display of athleticism, balance and body control bolstered his candidacy as a top pick. I believe Lewan deserves to be compared to Eric Fisher and Lane Johnson. Both prospects switched to their respective positions late in their athletic careers after playing as skill players as youngsters: Johnson played quarterback and tight end at Kilgore College before switching to offensive tackle at Oklahoma; Fisher played tight end in high school before moving to offensive tackle late in his career. Thus, they are raw, unpolished players prone to rely on their athleticism instead of fundamentals in key moments. Although each player has succeeded because of his athletic advantages, their struggles against elite defenders exposed their lack of polished footwork and fundamentals. While I regard Lewan as a better player than Fisher and Johnson at this stage of his career, I could see the Michigan standout taking some time to acclimate to the pro game because of his limited playing history at the position; Lewan played only one year at offensive tackle in high school before spending five seasons at Michigan).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Of course, the naysayers will point to Thomas' maddeningly inconsistent tape and scattershot accuracy as reasons for bypassing the Virginia Tech standout, but I would point out that the NFL is a developmental league. Thus, I'm more concerned with Thomas' natural talent, athleticism and football IQ as a possible late-round pick. Measuring 6-foot-6 and 248 pounds, Thomas is an impressive athlete with physical traits that are comparable to 2011 No. 1 overall pick Cam Newton. Now, I know there are plenty of skeptics who believe the former Hokie is better suited for a position change at the next level, but I believe Thomas offers more upside than nearly all of the quarterbacks being discussed as developmental prospects in this year's class. In fact, I would take Thomas over Pittsburgh's Tom Savage and SMU's Garrett Gilbert because he is more talented, athletic and experienced than those players, who are two of the fastest risers on the board at the position. If I had to pick a mid-to-late round quarterback prospect to draft and develop, I would invest my time and effort into Virginia Tech's Logan Thomas. Posted: April 23, 2014 at 11:15 a.m. Thomas is draft's most intriguing developmental QB option Drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the second round of the 1994 NFL Draft, Bucky Brooks played for",
    "textAfterTable": "I'm not suggesting Thomas is a playmaker of Newton's caliber, but it's important to note that several observers viewed the Virginia Tech standout as a first-round talent after his sensational sophomore year that saw him pass for 3,000-plus yards with a 19:10 touchdown-to-interception ratio, while tallying 11 rushing touchdowns. The big-bodied playmaker was so impressive guiding the Hokies' offense during the season that most expected him to challenge for the top overall spot in the 2013 draft, if he played up to his potential as a junior. Although Thomas didn't match the production or performance of his breakout season in subsequent years, he isn't a throwaway at the position based on his arm talent, athleticism and developmental potential. He flashed promise running a more traditional offense in 2013, exhibiting improved pocket presence and anticipation directing a vertical passing attack. Sure, there were plenty of questionable decisions and inaccurate throws, but every quarterback viewed as a Day 3 (Rounds 4-7) prospect has warts on their respective games. Thus, a patient quarterback coach adept at polishing footwork and fundamentals could clean up Thomas' game and help the big-bodied playmaker develop into a quality starter down the road. This is the same argument supporters of Savage and Gilbert are making in discussions with NFL executives; it's one that Thomas' team should pitch to teams looking for an athletic backup prospect with the potential to run an offense that features zone-read concepts, traditional play-action vertical routes and movement-based passes",
