            "Since many businesses look to Stout first for graduates to fill jobs, the chance of getting a job right out of school is actually pretty good. Stout has high respect for its top majors, so businesses know where to go for top prospects.",

Stout is known for technology, engineering, and arts (mostly digital). Anyone looking to go into one of these fields should consider Stout. If you like learning by doing this is great school for you. All of my classes have been so much more than lectures, everyone gets involved. Even typical lecture classes such as English are more like group discussions and we typically work in small groups on projects. Also with Stout you get small class sizes. My largest class has been speech and that only had about 25 students in it. Also, I thought I should note that for the next school year (2010-2011) Stout is going smoke-free. Smoking will be banned on the entire campus. Currently its banned in any buildings and within 25 feet of entrances to buildings., 290996=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I have actually learned so much here at Stout. I took classes that I thought I wouldn't learn anything in and ended up learning so many things that will help me in the future. I also think Stout has a great learning environment. My classes were not very big and I always felt free to ask any questions.
