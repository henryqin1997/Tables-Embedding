Food and Dining There is The Grind, which is like a subway and the tables and cafeteria are big and spacious. There is also a Starbucks at every building, sometimes two in one building. Victoria is all about learning and food. The teachers even bring food for their students. Dorm Life I do not know much about this for it is a okay drive from my home. My friend is just going to get a nice apartment there. Academic Rigor The teachers and other students push you to learn all you can. Every time I went to class the teacher talked about the clubs and when the meetings were and enticed us to join and gave points if you did.
