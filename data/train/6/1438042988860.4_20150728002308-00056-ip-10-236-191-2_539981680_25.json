Those underlined are part of the top 1000 jazz standards list., 7878=In March, 1940, ASCAP (the American Society of Composers, Artists and Producers), proposed a new contract increasing by 100 percent the royalties they received from broadcast use. In retaliation broadcasters created their own organization, BMI (Broadcast Music Incorporated) and began signing non-ASCAP songwriters. By the end of 1940, 650 broadcasters signed with BMI compared with only 200 who continued with ASCAP. At the end of 1941 ASCAP negotiated a new contract, but the \u201cban\u201d of ASCAP material by many broadcasters had a substantial effect on popular music. Many of the artists BMI signed during the ban were country or western swing artists, who subsequently received considerable airplay and a rise in the popularity of western music., 8644=Then in August, 1942, American Federation of Musicians president James C. Petrillo initiated a ban on recording, in hopes of coercing record companies into returning part of their profits to the union to be used for special concerts and projects. This forced the record companies to focus on recording singers and singing groups and reissuing previously recorded material. The ban lasted until Decca Records capitulated in September, 1943, but it would be another 14 months before RCA and Columbia would give in. Consequently the recording ban further weakened the popularity that the big bands had, and by the end of the decade the swing era had given way to the era of the pop singer., 38551=Copyright 2005-2012 - JazzStandards.com - All Rights Reserved\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Permission & contact information}",

There was a higher proportion of numbers written and performed by jazz artists like \u201cNight in Tunisia,\u201d \u201cPerdido,\u201d \u201cGood Bait\u201d and \u201cFour Brothers.\u201d \u201cOn a Slow Boat to China\u201d \u201cButtons and Bows\u201d \u201cYou Always Hurt the One You Love\u201d \u201cPaper Doll\u201d \u201cYou Made Me Love You\u201d \u201cChattanooga Choo Choo\u201d \u201cGod Bless the Child\u201d \u201cTake the \u2018A\u2019 Train\u201d \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d \u201cSentimental Journey\u201d \u201cRum and Coca-Cola\u201d \u201cTuxedo Junction\u201d \u201cIn the Mood\u201d Music from the 1940s reflected a wide spectrum of tastes, ranging from swing band numbers like \u201cIn the Mood,\u201d \u201cTuxedo Junction\u201d and \u201cTake the \u2018A\u2019 Train,\u201d to strictly Tin Pan Alley tunes like \u201cPaper Doll\u201d and \u201cButtons and Bows.\u201d Here\u2019s a brief list of tunes that were million sellers in the decade.
