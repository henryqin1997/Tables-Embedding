made the following property dispositions:, 123550=Future terrorist attacks in the U.S., such as the attacks that occurred in New York, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, and other acts of terrorism or war could harm the demand for, and the value of, our properties.\u00a0 A decrease in demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties at lease rates equal to, or above, historical rates.\u00a0 Terrorist attacks also could directly impact the value of our properties through damage, destruction, loss, or increased security costs, and the availability of insurance for these acts may be limited or costly.\u00a0 To the extent that our tenants are impacted by future attacks, their ability to honor obligations under their existing leases with us could be adversely affected., 103695=Factors That May Affect Our Future Results, 894138=Professional and administrative expenses reimbursed to affiliate from continuing operations for the years ended December\u00a031, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. \u00a0The decrease of $0.1 million, or 6%, was primarily due to decreased personnel costs

related to the debt refinancing on December\u00a017, 2009.\u00a0 The remaining increase of $0.4 million is the result of interest expense related to mortgages from our 2008 and 2009 acquisitions offset by decreased interest expense related to the interest rate swap and a decrease in the interest expense on our variable rate debt.\u00a0 There were no other material offsetting changes in interest expense for the years ended December\u00a031, 2009 and 2008., 177144=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lake
