    "textAfterTable": "The laboratory carried out metallic screen assays to determine if coarse gold was present.\u00a0 The assays of the three composites plus one duplicate sample show that 95% of the gold reports to the -140 mesh fraction.\u00a0 This is important because fine-grained gold leaches more readily than coarse-grained gold. The bottle roll tests were carried out at a pH of 11.2.\u00a0 The results for the 96 hour leach were 92.43%, 85.28%, and 95.14% recoveries of gold respectively.\u00a0 Graph 1 below shows the results for grade vs time for gold. Graph 1 Silver recoveries were lower then expected, however this is typical for heap leach operations.\u00a0 Silver accounts for less than 20% of the dollar value of the deposit. The Company is pleased with these preliminary results from San Roque. We look forward to conducting further testing on the property.
