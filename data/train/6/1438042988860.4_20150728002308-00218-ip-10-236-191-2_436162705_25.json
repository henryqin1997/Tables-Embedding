Each index has been normalized so that its peak is 100. Both the CoreLogic price index and the FHFA index (formerly calculated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight) include purchase transactions only. The S&P/Case-Shiller index reflects all arm's-length sales transactions in selected metropolitan areas., 393870=Horizon: 1991 to 2011, 404366=Note: Through 2010, receipts and expenditures are for fiscal years (October through September); gross domestic product (GDP) is for the four quarters ending in Q3. For 2011, receipts and expenditures are for the 12 months ending in May, and GDP is the average of 2010:Q4 and 2011:Q1. Receipts and expenditures are on a unified-budget basis., 347270=Horizon: 2005 to 2011:Q1, 320173=Description: Data are plotted as two curves and are expressed as indexes (for the Conference Board data, 1985 = 100; for the Thomson Reuters/Michigan data, 1966 = 100)., 394957=The series for CMBS starts in 1999 at around 1, rises slowly to around 2 in late 2003, falls to about 1 in mid-2008, and then rises sharply to end at 10 by mid-2011., 320375=The Conference Board curve starts at about 112 in 2001, and the Thomson Reuters/Michigan curve starts at about 90. The Conference Board curve then rises to about 120 in early 2001 and falls to about 85 in year-end 2001; the Thomson Reuters/Michigan curve rises to about 93 in early 2001 and falls to about 80 in year-end 2001. The Conference Board curve fluctuates between about 78 and 115 and the Thomson Reuters/Michigan curve fluctuates between about 78 and 95 until early 2003, when the Conference Board curve temporarily drops to about 60 and the Thomson Reuters/Michigan curve reaches about 80. From mid-2003 through mid-2007, the Conference Board curve generally trends up and reaches about 110 in mid-2007, while the Thomson Reuters/Michigan curve generally fluctuates within a range of about 85 to 95 in the period. From mid-2007 through early 2009, the curves decline sharply, on net, with Conference Board reaching near 20 and Thomson Reuters/Michigan a bit below 60 by the end of the period. The curves then increase through mid-2009 and level out around 50 for Conference Board and 70 for Thomson Reuters/Michigan in year-end 2009. Toward the end of 2010, both curves dip before shooting upward in the first two months of 2011. By mid-2011, the end of the charted data for Conference Board is on the decline at about 60, and the data for Thomson Reuters/Michigan is almost 75., 394476=The nonfarm nonresidential delinquency rate starts in 1991 at around 10 and slowly falls to around 3 by 1999. It remains at about that level until mid-2008 and then rises slowly to end at around 5 by early 2011., 394075=In the upper panel, the construction and land development delinquency rate series starts in 1991 at around 18, remains at about that level through early 1993, then falls evenly to around 3 by mid-1999. It remains at about that level until 2006 and then rises quickly to around 18 by 2008. It remains elevated at around 18 until mid-2010 and then falls to end at around 16 by mid-2011., 321885=Note: The Conference Board data are monthly and extend through June 2011; the series is indexed to equal 100 in 1985. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan data are monthly and extend through June 2011; the series is indexed to equal 100 in 1966., 306098=Note: The data are quarterly and extend through 2011:Q2; the reading for 2011:Q2 is the average for April and May., 337575=Horizon: 2007 to 2011, 308410=Note: Through 2010, change is from December to December; for 2011, change is from December to May., 535953=Note: The data are monthly and extend through June 2011., 392731=Note: The data are drawn from a survey conducted monthly and are seasonally adjusted; the last observation is from the June 2011 survey, which covers May 2011. The data represent the proportion of borrowers who sought credit in the past three months that reported more difficulty in obtaining credit less the proportion that reported more ease in obtaining credit., 320118=Horizon: 2001 to 2011, 133513=Note: The data are monthly and extend through May 2011 for prime and near prime and April 2011 for subprime. Delinquency rate is the percent of loans 90 days or more past due or in foreclosure., 44390=Note: The data are monthly and extend through May 2011., 394704=In the lower panel, the delinquency rate for loans held by life insurance companies starts in 1991 at about 5, rises to almost 8 in 1992, then declines steadily to around 0 by late 2004, and remains at about that level until early 2011., 321781=The curves overlap in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2008., 347451=The series rises from about 250 in 2005 to about 360 in 2006. It rises to about 425 in 2007. In 2008, it is about 75; in 2009, it is about 60. Quarterly data, which are provided after 2009, show the series rising from about 150 in 2010:Q1 to about 275 by 2010:Q4. In 2011:Q1, it rises to about 425., 22122=Note: The data are monthly and extend through May 2011; changes are from one year earlier., 338428=Note: The data are weekly and extend through July 7, 2011. The spreads shown are the yields on two-year fixed-rate asset-backed securities less rates on two-year interest rate swaps., 283573=Note: The data, which are weekly and extend through July 6, 2011, are contract rates on 30-year mortgages., 337732=The two series move very closely together through the horizon. From January 2007 through July 2007, both series remain very close to 0. From July 2007 to March 2008, auto rises to around 150, and credit card rises to around 110. Auto falls to around 90, and credit card falls to around 60 by July 2008. Auto then rapidly rises to around 550, and credit card rapidly rises to around 530 by late 2008. Both series quickly fall to around 100 in June 2009; they then continue to fall more gradually to reach levels around 10 by January 2010. Both series remain generally at that level from January 2010 until the end of the horizon in early July 2011., 736361=Note: The data are monthly and extend through May 2011; they are six-month moving averages. Duration is through the month before potentially becoming employed.
