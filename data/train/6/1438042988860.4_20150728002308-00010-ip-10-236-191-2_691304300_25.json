WARNINGS For single use only \u2022 Only surgeons who have received adequate training to determine whether incompetent, stenotic or diseased heart valves are capable of being repaired or replaced should use this device. \u2022 Only surgeons who have received appropriate training in valve repair, including band implant and sizing techniques, should use this device. \u2022 Care should be taken that sutures are not placed in atrial tissue, as this may result in impairment of the cardiac conduction system. \u2022 Intra-operative and/or post-operative echocardiography, in conjunction with a cardiologist, should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the valve repair. Minimizing regurgitation and systolic anterior motion (SAM) are important elements of an effective repair. \u2022 Surgeons who use annuloplasty bands should be current on all anticoagulation regimes. \u2022 When post-operative",
