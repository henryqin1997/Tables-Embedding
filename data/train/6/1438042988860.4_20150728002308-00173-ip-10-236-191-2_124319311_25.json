Each officer of Alcide has agreed to the cash-out in his employment agreement with Ecolab and therefore may not elect to have his options assumed by Ecolab., 604749=price associated with each right is subject to equitable adjustment as provided in the rights agreement in connection with any similar events associated with the preferred stock and certain other dilutive events. As a result of two two-for-one stock splits, each effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend, one in 1997 and the other in 2003, each share of Ecolab common stock presently outstanding has, and each share of Ecolab common stock issued in the merger or otherwise will have, attached to it one-quarter of a right., 287670=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On November\u00a04, 2003, Mr.\u00a0Newlin delivered a letter to Mr.\u00a0Sasenick expressing Ecolab's interest in acquiring Alcide at a preliminary valuation of between $16.00 and $19.00 per share, subject to a continuing review of Alcide's business and operations. Based on input from Alcide's board of directors, Alcide delivered a letter dated November\u00a06, 2003, with a proposed range of between $21.00 and $27.00 per share. Alcide's response letter also proposed that Alcide would agree not to solicit indications of interest from or discuss acquisition possibilities with other potential suitors in consideration of a $250,000 cash payment, reflecting Mr.\u00a0Sasenick's concern relating to the costs of pursuing a transaction with Ecolab. In late November\u00a02003, after further internal review by Ecolab and several telephonic discussions between Messrs.\u00a0Newlin and Sasenick, it was agreed that Ecolab would continue its due diligence analysis with a tentative understanding that Ecolab could move above its preliminary valuation range., 585833=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling Ecolab pursuant to the provisions described above, Ecolab has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable., 445739=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of June\u00a011, 2004, Ecolab had 257,349,374 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, excluding shares held in treasury. Assuming an aggregate of 2,701,371 shares of Alcide common stock issued and outstanding and an average Ecolab share price of $31.38 on such date, Ecolab would issue approximately 1,807,757 shares of Ecolab common stock upon completion of the merger. As a result, following completion of the merger, and assuming Ecolab does not issue any additional shares of its common stock, Alcide stockholders would own approximately 0.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of Ecolab common stock., 809690=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent required in connection with the Parent SEC Reports, the Parent's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have signed, and the Parent has furnished to the SEC, all necessary certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such certifications contain no qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein and have not been modified or withdrawn, and neither the Parent nor any of its officers has received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such certifications nor to the Parent's Knowledge is any such notice or action threatened., 285038=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On September\u00a023, 2003, Ecolab began consulting with Credit Suisse First Boston regarding the potential transaction and subsequently engaged them as Ecolab's financial advisor., 930472=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(q)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\" Exchange Act \" shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder., 233158=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On June\u00a011, 2004, there were approximately 2,701,371 shares of Alcide common stock and 257,349,374 shares of Ecolab common stock outstanding., 641703=dated as of March\u00a011, 2004, 14097=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The registrant hereby amends this registration statement on such date or dates as may be necessary to delay its effective date until the registrant shall file\u00a0a further amendment which specifically states that this registration statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with Section\u00a08(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 or until the registration statement shall become effective on such date as the Securities and Exchange Commission, acting pursuant to said Section\u00a08(a), may determine., 88589=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The special meeting of Alcide stockholders will be held on July\u00a030, 2004, at 9:00\u00a0a.m. local time at Alcide's offices located at 8561 154 th Avenue N.E., Redmond, Washington. The purposes of the special meeting are as follows:, 17335=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We cannot complete the merger unless Alcide stockholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger, and a special meeting of Alcide stockholders has been called for that purpose.

This proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information about the proposed merger and the special meeting.

Also in early December, Mr.\u00a0Sasenick conveyed to Mr.\u00a0Newlin his continued concern about the cost and expense of negotiating a transaction with Ecolab. Mr.\u00a0Sasenick repeated Alcide's proposal that Ecolab reimburse Alcide for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of a potential transaction, up to a maximum of $250,000, in exchange for which Alcide would agree not to solicit indications of interest from or discuss acquisition possibilities with other potential suitors. At that time, Ecolab was unwilling to accept the proposal., 431123=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The foregoing summary is qualified by reference to the written opinion dated as of March\u00a011, 2004, of Duff\u00a0& Phelps, which is attached as Appendix\u00a0C to this information statement., 205382=share information reflects the two-for-one stock split declared in June\u00a02003.

Shares of Ecolab common stock held by these affiliates may only be sold pursuant to a registration statement or an applicable exemption under the Securities Act., 302721=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On February\u00a05, 2004, Perkins Coie provided a formal mark-up of the merger agreement that reflected Alcide's prior comments. Thereafter, until March\u00a010, 2004, Ecolab and Alcide held numerous telephone conferences and exchanged mark-ups in the course of negotiating the merger agreement. During this same period, representatives of Ecolab had numerous discussions with Messrs.\u00a0Sasenick and Richards about the need for and certain details of retention arrangements for key employees in order to ease merger-related concerns. On February\u00a019, 2004, Ecolab provided Alcide with a proposed form of employment agreement that it expected would be signed by each of Alcide's officers and the key individuals identified earlier by Ecolab, together with the proposed retention package for each such person. Ecolab also reiterated its position that an employment agreement from each of these individuals was an essential component of Ecolab's willingness to proceed with the merger. Thereafter, Ecolab negotiated the employment agreements with each individual officer or employee., 286212=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October\u00a021, 2003, the Alcide board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting. Among other topics, Mr.\u00a0Sasenick updated the board regarding the status of discussions with Ecolab and Ecolab's continuing interest in a business combination. The Alcide board of directors authorized Mr.\u00a0Sasenick to continue the discussions. In doing so, the board believed that proceeding with discussions with Ecolab was consistent with Alcide's long-term strategy of achieving stability in Alcide's financial and operational performance. In addition, the board believed that, in light of information available to it and Alcide's recent experiences exploring potential strategic alternatives, pursuing discussions with Ecolab was a preferred alternative to attempting a sale of Alcide through an auction process or to otherwise soliciting interest from other potential acquirors, as such efforts could jeopardize discussions with Ecolab. Moreover, the Alcide board believed that if it ultimately approved a combination with Ecolab, the public announcement of such a transaction would bring Alcide to the attention of other likely merger partners or buyers, and the board intended to try to negotiate, in the definitive agreement with Ecolab, for flexibility to enter into discussions with serious merger partners or buyers who might emerge after such an announcement., 807992=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parent has filed with the SEC, at or prior to the time due, and has heretofore made available to the Company true and complete copies of, all forms, reports, schedules, registration statements, definitive proxy statements and other documents (together with all information incorporated therein by reference, the \" Parent SEC Reports \") it was required to file with the SEC since January\u00a01, 2001.

As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports. As of their respective dates and as of the date any information from such Company SEC Reports has been incorporated by reference, the Company SEC Reports did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Section\u00a03.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all comment letters or other correspondence received by the Company from the Staff of the SEC since June\u00a01, 2000 with respect to any Company SEC Report or otherwise and all responses to such comment letters or correspondence by or on behalf of the Company, copies of all of which have been provided to the Parent, except letters and correspondence subject to an attorney-client privilege., 634418=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In this proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference herein, Ecolab discusses expectations regarding its future performance which include anticipated business progress and expansion, business acquisitions, debt repayments, susceptibility to changes in technology, global economic conditions and liquidity requirements. Without limiting the foregoing, words or phrases such as \"will likely result,\" \"are expected to,\" \"will continue,\" \"is anticipated,\" \"we believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"project\" (including the negative or variations thereof) or similar terminology, generally identify forward-looking statements. Additionally, Ecolab may refer to this section of the proxy statement/prospectus to identify risk factors related to other forward looking statements made in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or webcasts open to the public., 438253=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assuming that all Alcide directors and employees agree to the cash-out, as of June\u00a011, 2004, an aggregate of $1,163,889 will be paid to the holders of outstanding Alcide options, including $665,231 to Alcide's directors and officers. Of the amount payable to Alcide's directors and officers, $500,114 is attributable to options which are currently vested. It is anticipated that options to purchase 27,000 shares of Alcide common stock held by certain officers of Alcide that will otherwise expire prior to the closing of the merger will be exercised prior to closing. If all such options are exercised, the aggregate cash-pay out to the holders of outstanding options will be $829,764, including $331,106 to Alcide's directors and officers. The following table shows the effect of option cancellations and accelerated vesting, assuming that all Alcide employees agree to the cash-out and do not exercise any options prior to completion of the merger. Alcide's nonemployee directors, Messrs.\u00a0Spears and Baker, are not affected by accelerated vesting because all of their options were fully vested on the date of grant. These directors will receive option cash-out payments totaling $76,028., 602326=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Henkel stockholder's agreement provides that beginning in 2011, Henkel will be permitted to make proposals to the Ecolab board of directors to acquire all, but not less than all, of Ecolab's outstanding voting shares at certain times, and under terms and conditions set forth in the Henkel stockholder's agreement., 335520=presentation by Duff\u00a0& Phelps delivered to the board of directors of Alcide on March\u00a011, 2004, and included with this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix\u00a0D. The Duff\u00a0& Phelps opinion is based on the totality of the various analyses that it performed, and no particular portion of the analysis has any merit standing alone.

At a meeting held on March\u00a011, 2004, the Alcide board of directors unanimously adopted the merger agreement and determined that the merger is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Alcide and its stockholders and resolved to recommend that Alcide's stockholders vote FOR the approval of the merger agreement., 492392=1996 Stock Option Plan for Nonemployee Directors and 1993 Incentive Stock Option Plan, 281176=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the past three years, Alcide's growth strategy included possible acquisitions of proprietary technologies in order to attain critical mass in the animal health and food safety industries. Through the acquisition of proprietary technologies that would complement, expand and diversify Alcide's product offering in the red meat, poultry and fish processing and other animal health and food safety markets Alcide served, Alcide believed it would be better able to mitigate the volatility of its financial and operating results that it historically experienced. In pursuit of this strategy, Alcide engaged in exploratory discussions with several companies regarding the potential acquisition of proprietary technologies that served the animal health and food safety industries. In most cases, these discussions did not proceed beyond the preliminary stage. In the case of two of these potential acquisitions, discussions proceeded to more substantive negotiations. However, Alcide did not proceed to definitive agreement in either case due to Alcide's ultimate assessment that both acquisitions did not fully meet Alcide's expectations or goals. In addition, to acquisition discussions, in mid-2003, Alcide had preliminary discussions with another company regarding a potential business combination. These discussions did not proceed beyond the exploratory phase due to differences over valuation expectations, including the other party's unwillingness to entertain a premium for acquiring Alcide., 552593=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Sasenick is Alcide's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Free cash flow is defined as cash that is available either to reinvest in new businesses or to distribute to securityholders in the form of dividends, stock buybacks, or debt service. Alcide management provided Duff\u00a0& Phelps with financial projections, and Duff\u00a0& Phelps informed the board that Duff\u00a0& Phelps considered such projections and consulted with Alcide management as part of its process of developing an independent estimate of the future free cash flows for Alcide. Duff\u00a0& Phelps also estimated the terminal value of Alcide's business in 2008., 285305=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October\u00a010, 2003, following a regularly scheduled meeting of Alcide's Audit Committee, the Alcide board of directors held a brief meeting at which Mr.\u00a0Sasenick provided an update of various acquisition targets that Alcide was evaluating and other strategic business opportunities. Mr.\u00a0Sasenick also advised the board of Ecolab's expression of interest and the plan for continuing discussions. The Alcide board of directors authorized Mr.\u00a0Sasenick to proceed., 484574=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, all options granted under the 2001 plan, whether or not vested at the time the merger agreement was signed, have become fully vested and exercisable contingent upon completion of the merger.

Also attending the meeting were representatives of Perkins Coie LLP, who addressed various questions regarding the merger agreement and general duties relating to the fiduciary obligations of the board of directors. Mr.\u00a0Sasenick led a discussion regarding Alcide's reasons for pursuing this transaction in light of Alcide's recent history in evaluating various strategic alternatives that included, among other things, exploring the potential acquisition of proprietary technologies from other companies and entering into exploratory discussions with a third party in mid-2003 regarding a potential business combination. The board discussed the volatility of the markets in which Alcide competes and the unpredictability of the operating and financial performance of Alcide's business units in light of such volatility and the lack of market liquidity for Alcide's common stock. The board also briefly discussed the potential for the acquisition by Ecolab as a means to reduce operational and financial volatility that has resulted in earnings volatility and concluded that most reasonable acquisition opportunities available presently would likely be in the same markets currently served by Alcide., 529873=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An additional condition required the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and any other applicable antitrust laws.

In December\u00a02003, Henkel reported that it may sell a portion or all of its holdings of Ecolab common stock and/or its holdings of common stock of The Clorox Company, or a combination of both, in connection with financing its pending acquisition of The Dial Corporation. Any disposition by Henkel of any shares of Ecolab common stock would be effected in an orderly manner in accordance with the Henkel stockholder's agreement, including Ecolab's right of first refusal., 559411=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the terms of the employment agreement, Mr.\u00a0Kemp's starting base salary will be $156,000 per year, which represents an increase of $13,976 over his current base salary at Alcide. Consistent with other Ecolab employees at the same grade level, Mr.\u00a0Kemp will be eligible for a performance-based bonus targeted at 25% of base salary and which is capped at 50%. As with the other Alcide officers, this reflects a decrease in Mr.\u00a0Kemp's bonus potential with Alcide, which was capped at 100% of base salary and resulted in an actual pay-out of 40% of base salary for fiscal year 2003, which was made pursuant to Alcide's Management Incentive Plan described above. The employment agreement provides for a one-time option grant covering 10,000 shares of Ecolab common stock. The option grant is consistent with grants given to similarly situated Ecolab employees. Mr.\u00a0Kemp will be entitled to one year's severance upon termination, consistent with similarly situated Ecolab employees. As part of the employment agreement, Mr.\u00a0Kemp has agreed to release and discharge any and all existing employment arrangements he may have with, and any and all claims he may have against, Alcide, and has also agreed to non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, and assignment of inventions restrictions and obligations., 561307=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the terms of the employment agreement, Mr.\u00a0Winter's starting base salary will be $130,000 per year, which is represents an increase of $3,874 over his current base salary at Alcide. Consistent with other Ecolab employees at the same grade level, Mr.\u00a0Winter will be eligible for a performance-based bonus targeted at 25% of base salary and which is capped at 50%. As with the other Alcide officers, this reflects a decrease in Mr.\u00a0Winter's bonus potential with Alcide, which was capped at 100% of base salary and resulted in an actual pay-out of 19% of base salary for fiscal year 2003, which was made pursuant to Alcide's Management Incentive Plan described above. The employment agreement provides for a one-time option grant covering 8,000 shares of Ecolab common stock. The option grant is consistent with grants to similarly situated Ecolab employees. Mr.\u00a0Winter will be entitled to a company car during the term of his employment and one year's severance upon termination, both of which are benefits given to similarly situated Ecolab employees. As part of the employment agreement, Mr.\u00a0Winter has agreed to release and discharge any and all existing employment arrangements he may have with, and any and all claims he may have against, Alcide, and has also agreed to non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, and assignment of inventions restrictions and obligations., 100177=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The automatic conversion mechanism does not apply to any other options granted by Alcide, including those granted under its 1993 Incentive Stock Option Plan and its 1996 Stock Option Plan for Nonemployee Directors. However, the merger agreement requires Alcide to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the holders of these options to agree to a cash-out on the same terms applicable to options granted under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. If the holders of such options agree, their options will accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable to the extent not fully vested as of the date of the completion of the merger.

If this price were used to calculate the exchange ratio, Ecolab would issue 0.6692 shares of Ecolab common stock for each share of Alcide common stock, resulting in an aggregate issuance of approximately 1,807,757 shares of Ecolab common stock to holders of Alcide common stock. Following completion of the merger, and assuming Ecolab does not issue any additional shares of its common stock, Alcide stockholders would own approximately 0.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of Ecolab common stock., 305312=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On February\u00a019, 2004, Ecolab delivered draft employment agreements to Messrs.\u00a0Richards, Kemp and Winter. On February\u00a024, 2004, Ecolab delivered a draft employment agreement to Mr.\u00a0Sasenick. On March\u00a02, 2004, Ecolab representatives met with each of the individuals from whom employment agreements would be required in order to review the terms of those agreements., 3783=As filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June\u00a023, 2004, 492545=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 1996 Stock Option Plan for Nonemployee Directors and the 1993 Incentive Stock Option Plan each require Ecolab to assume all outstanding options granted under those plans. However, the merger agreement requires Alcide to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the holders of outstanding options under those plans and any other outstanding options (other than those granted pursuant to Alcide's 2001 Stock Incentive Plan) to agree to a cash-out on the same economic terms as apply to options granted under the 2001 plan, including acceleration of vesting for all such outstanding options. Acceleration of vesting will not impact the 1996 plan, as all options granted thereunder vest immediately in full on the grant date.

The transaction structure remained an open issue, as Ecolab and Alcide had not settled on whether, if the transaction were to proceed, the consideration should be paid in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. After December\u00a019, 2003, Mr.\u00a0Sasenick had one-on-one conversations with each of Alcide's directors and received a preliminary consensus from the directors in favor of the transaction, if it were to proceed, at a price of $21.00 per share and a preference to structure the combination as a stock-for-stock merger., 242241=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger by the Alcide stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Alcide common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. As of June\u00a011, 2004, approximately 23.6% of the outstanding shares of Alcide common stock were held by directors and officers of Alcide and their affiliates. Neither Ecolab nor any of its directors or officers owns any shares of Alcide common stock., 99436=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each outstanding stock option granted under Alcide's 2001 Stock Incentive Plan has become fully vested and exercisable, contingent upon completion of the merger. To the extent not exercised prior to the merger, each such option will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to $21.00 multiplied by the number of shares subject to the option, less the aggregate exercise price of the option. For example, an option to purchase 100 shares of Alcide common stock at an exercise price of $15.00 per share would be converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $600.00 ($21.00 \u00d7 100 shares - $1,500\u00a0= $600)., 1034996=CORPORATE ADVISORS SINCE 1932, 288812=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On December\u00a03, 2003, a group of Ecolab managers, including a research and development team, met with Alcide's senior managers to discuss possible business synergies and technology issues.

As of June\u00a011, 2004, an aggregate of 20,800 options would be accelerated under the 1993 plan if all holders of those options agree to receive the cash-out payment, which would result in an aggregate cash-out payment of $70,934 for such accelerated options. Assuming all holders of outstanding options under the 1993 plan agree to receive a cash-out payment and do not exercise prior to completion of the merger, the weighted average exercise price per share of such fully vested options as of June\u00a011, 2004, is $20.98 and the aggregate cash-out payment would be $634,776. It is anticipated that fully vested options to purchase 27,000 shares of Alcide common stock held by certain officers of Alcide that will otherwise expire prior to the closing of the merger will be exercised prior to closing.

Duff\u00a0& Phelps has significant expertise and experience in fairness opinions, business valuations, solvency opinions, structuring ESOP/ERISA transactions, private capital raise, buy-side and sell-side merger and acquisition advisory services, and intangible asset and intellectual property valuations.

At Alcide's request, Mr.\u00a0Newlin, Lawrence Bell, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Ecolab, Michael Monahan, Vice President, Investor Relations of Ecolab, and Thomas Grover, Corporate Development-Vice President of Ecolab, attended a portion of the meeting. Mr.\u00a0Monahan delivered a presentation regarding Ecolab, its business and the proposed merger, and Mr.\u00a0Monahan and the other Ecolab representatives answered various questions posed by the board of directors. Following the presentation, the Alcide board of directors confirmed to the Ecolab representatives Alcide's interest in a price of $21.00 per share and a transaction structured as a stock merger. After Ecolab's representatives were dismissed from the meeting, the board of directors continued to discuss and evaluate Ecolab's proposal. Alcide had received a draft of the merger agreement and was working with Perkins Coie to evaluate the draft. Messrs.\u00a0Sasenick and Richards, who also attended the meeting, noted that several business issues relating to, among other things, post-signing restrictions on Alcide's operations, employee benefits, employment agreements and the termination fee, needed to be resolved between the parties. Perkins Coie provided a summary of fiduciary obligations of the board of directors in evaluating a potential business combination with Ecolab. The board also approved the retention of Duff\u00a0& Phelps as its financial advisor regarding the fairness of the transaction to Alcide's stockholders from a financial point of view. The board's interest in a price per share of $21.00 was subject to a determination by Duff\u00a0& Phelps that $21.00 per share was fair from a financial point of view to Alcide's stockholders. The board then telephoned a representative of Duff\u00a0& Phelps, who described the process that Duff\u00a0& Phelps would undertake in preparing its fairness opinion. On the same day, Ecolab delivered to Perkins Coie a draft of the agreements to facilitate merger that Ecolab would require to be signed by each officer and director of Alcide., 307542=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March\u00a011, 2004, the Alcide board of directors held a special telephonic meeting to consider the final terms of the proposed merger with Ecolab, which was attended members of the Alcide board other than Thomas Kempner and by representatives of Duff\u00a0& Phelps and Perkins Coie. Duff\u00a0& Phelps' written materials were provided to all members of Alcide's board in advance of the meeting. A copy of these materials is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix\u00a0D. At the meeting, a representative from Duff\u00a0& Phelps presented an overview of the analysis and methodologies utilized by Duff\u00a0& Phelps to conduct its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view of the transaction to the non-management public stockholders of Alcide and discussed the written presentation summarizing its analysis. Following this presentation, the representatives from Duff\u00a0& Phelps were dismissed from the meeting and Perkins Coie led a brief discussion regarding final wording changes relating solely to certain covenants and representations and warranties reflected in the final draft of the merger agreement. Following the conclusion of the meeting, the Alcide board of directors by unanimous written consent, including Mr.\u00a0Kempner, authorized the execution of the merger agreement and resolved to recommend that the Alcide stockholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger., 75609=Ecolab\u00a0Inc. 370 Wabasha Street North St. Paul, Minnesota 55102 Phone: (651)\u00a0293-2233, 552927=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the terms of the employment agreement, Mr.\u00a0Sasenick's starting base salary will be $287,929 per year, which is the same as his current base salary at Alcide.

This table includes percentage ownership data reflecting ownership both before and after completion of the merger with Ecolab. The pre-merger percentage ownership is based on 2,701,371 shares of Alcide common stock outstanding as of June\u00a011, 2004. The post-merger percentage ownership includes 1,807,757 shares of Ecolab common stock, which is the number of shares that would be issued to Alcide stockholders in the merger assuming an average Ecolab share price of $31.38, which was the most recent closing price of Ecolab common stock as of June\u00a011, 2004. The post-merger number of shares of Ecolab common stock beneficially owned by each director and officer of Alcide assumes that all options to purchase Alcide common stock beneficially owned by each director and officer of Alcide will be cashed-out or cancelled in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, except as noted. All shares subject to options exercisable within 60\u00a0days after June\u00a011, 2004, are deemed to be beneficially owned by the person holding that option and to be outstanding solely for calculating that person's percentage ownership., 617787=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information of Ecolab Inc. for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, incorporated by reference in this prospectus, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP reported that they have applied limited procedures in accordance with professional standards for a review of such information. However, their separate report dated April 22, 2004 incorporated by reference herein, states that they did not audit and they do not express an opinion on that unaudited consolidated financial information. Accordingly, the degree of reliance on their report on such information should be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review procedures applied.

On January\u00a027, 2004, Ecolab, Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly and Perkins Coie discussed by telephone Alcide's initial reaction to the draft merger agreement, as well as timing and logistical issues. Particular attention was paid to operating covenants and the fiduciary obligations of the Alcide board of directors in light of the deal protection measures that Ecolab was requesting, including the amount of the termination fee, the fiduciary obligations in relation to potential competing offers and the agreements to facilitate merger. Perkins Coie also confirmed Alcide's preference for a stock merger., 793576=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.19. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Relations with Suppliers and Customers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No material current supplier of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has canceled or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to cancel any Contract for the provision of, or indicated an intention to reduce its supply of or not to provide, raw materials, products, supplies, or services to the businesses of the Company or any Company Subsidiary either prior to or following the Merger.

The board of directors continued its discussion of business issues relating to the transaction, including the termination fee, voting agreements to be delivered by directors and officers, the request from Ecolab that certain affiliates of directors deliver voting agreements, treatment of payments that had accrued under Alcide's incentive plans and the employment packages to be offered by Ecolab., 963190=Oppenheimer Wolff\u00a0& Donnelly LLP Plaza\u00a0VII, Suite\u00a03300 Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402-1609 Fax: (612)\u00a0607-7100 Attention: Timothy J.

However, certain types of changes will not prevent the transaction from going forward, even if they would have a material adverse effect on Ecolab or Alcide, including:, 736174=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Absence of Certain Changes or Events. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except as contemplated hereby or as disclosed in Section\u00a03.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or in the Company SEC Reports, since November\u00a030, 2003, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their business in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice and there has not been:, 963607=Alcide Corporation 8651 154 th Avenue N.E.

Following completion of the merger, and assuming Ecolab does not issue any additional shares of its common stock, Alcide stockholders would own approximately 0.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of Ecolab common stock., 280422=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Growth through acquisitions has long been a key component of Ecolab's business strategy. Ecolab first considered the prospect of acquiring Alcide in 1996 following the resolution of patent litigation between Alcide and ABS Global,\u00a0Inc., in which Ecolab had become involved. Ecolab was primarily attracted to Alcide's patent portfolio and other intellectual property rights, and acquisitions can often serve as a mutually agreeable resolution to patent disputes. However, the litigation settled before Ecolab had an opportunity to approach Alcide with an acquisition proposal. Therefore, the parties did not discuss the possibility of an acquisition at that time., 797689=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.21. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Company Products; Regulation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except as set forth in Section\u00a03.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule: (a)\u00a0since June\u00a01, 2000 through the date hereof there have been no notices, citations or decisions by any Governmental Entity that any Company Products are defective or fail to meet any applicable standards promulgated by any such Governmental Entity; (b)\u00a0the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all Laws and specifications with respect to the design, manufacture, labeling, testing and inspection of Company Products promulgated by any Governmental Entity; and (c)\u00a0since June\u00a01, 2000 through the date hereof, there have been no recalls, field notifications, seizures FDA warning letters or FDA Form\u00a0483 notifications ordered or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by any such Governmental Entity with respect to any of the Company Products.

Alcide's board previously considered whether to engage a financial advisor with respect to a potential combination with Ecolab but believed that it would need to engage a financial advisor only with respect to a determination that the transaction was fair from a financial point of view to Alcide's stockholders since Alcide was not pursuing an auction process and in light of the collective experience of the members of the board and senior management. On that same date, Duff\u00a0& Phelps sent its proposal regarding the engagement, which was received by Alcide on January\u00a019, 2004., 193642=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the number of shares of Ecolab common stock to be issued in the merger will not be known until the fifth trading day prior to the completion of the merger, Alcide's equivalent per share data cannot be computed at this time. That information will be available via telephone, toll-free, at 1-800-316-6480. Hypothetical Alcide equivalent per share data is presented below using the most recent closing sale price of a share of Ecolab common stock as of June\u00a011, 2004, which was $31.38, and a resulting hypothetical exchange ratio of 0.6692. The hypothetical Alcide equivalent per share data was calculated by multiplying the actual Ecolab per share data by the hypothetical exchange ratio of 0.6692. No pro forma Ecolab information giving effect to the merger is presented because the merger will not materially change the Ecolab historical amounts presented., 619435=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The audit report of KPMG LLP covering the May\u00a031, 2003 consolidated financial statements of Alcide refers to the audit of the disclosures added to revise the 2001 consolidated financial statements to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.\u00a0142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted by Alcide as of June\u00a01, 2001, as more fully described in Note\u00a02 to the consolidated financial statements. However, KPMG LLP was not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 consolidated financial statements other than with respect to such disclosures., 483661=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the terms of the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, a successor corporation in a merger can elect whether to assume outstanding options granted under the plan. Ecolab has elected not to assume those options. Instead, to the extent not exercised prior to the merger, each such option will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to $21.00 multiplied by the number of shares subject to the option, less the aggregate exercise price of the option. For example, an option to purchase 100 shares of Alcide common stock at an exercise price of $15.00 per share would be converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $600.00. Options with an exercise price at or greater than $21.00 per share will be cancelled and the holders will forfeit the opportunity to realize value from those options., 443736=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ecolab has entered into an employment agreement with Mr.\u00a0Sasenick with a term commencing on the date the merger is completed and continuing for a period of six months or until February\u00a018, 2005, whichever is later, after which Ecolab and Mr.\u00a0Sasenick will sign a three-year consulting agreement. Ecolab has also entered into at-will employment agreements with Messrs.\u00a0Richards, Kemp and Winter. The effectiveness of each of the employment agreements is conditioned upon completion of the merger. These terms of these employment agreements and Mr.\u00a0Sasenick's consulting agreement are described in greater detail on page 61 under \"Agreements Related to the Merger\u0097Employment Agreements.\", 785180=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has ever been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section\u00a0897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

You should read this data along with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of Ecolab and Alcide incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus and, with respect to Alcide, furnished herewith., 309321=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At a special meeting held on February\u00a04, 2004, the Ecolab board of directors unanimously authorized its senior management team to negotiate and execute the merger agreement and proceed with the merger. Underlying the board's decision were the following factors, among others:, 241270=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The holders of Ecolab common stock receive dividends if and when declared by the Ecolab board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. Ecolab expects to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of dividends after the merger will depend upon business conditions, operating results and the Ecolab board of directors' consideration of other relevant factors. Ecolab declared dividends of $77,132,000 in 2003, or approximately 28% of Ecolab's 2003 consolidated net income. Per share dividends declared of $0.2975 in 2003 increased 8.2% from 2002., 417265=Projected EPS for comparable public companies ranged from the fiscal year periods ended August\u00a031, 2004 to May\u00a031, 2005. Alcide's projected EPS was based on the fiscal year period ended May\u00a031, 2004., 620566=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consolidated financial statements of Alcide for the year ended May\u00a031, 2001, incorporated by reference herein and in the registration statement, were audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public accountants., 119120=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both Ecolab and Alcide made filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice as required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in connection with the merger. Early termination of the applicable waiting period was granted on April\u00a07, 2004, although either agency may still at any time take action against Ecolab and Alcide in relation to the merger, even after the merger is completed. We are not aware of any other governmental approvals or actions that are required to complete the merger other than compliance with federal securities laws and Delaware corporate law., 155278=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ecolab's former Henkel-Ecolab joint venture is included as a consolidated subsidiary effective with Ecolab's purchase of the remaining 50% interest of this joint venture not already owned on November\u00a030, 2001. Results for 2002 and 2003 reflect the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.\u00a0142, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\" All per share and shares outstanding data reflect the two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend paid June\u00a06, 2003, to stockholders of record on May\u00a023, 2003., 347625=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Duff\u00a0& Phelps' fairness opinion is based upon an analysis of the foregoing in light of its assessment of the general, economic and financial market conditions, as they can be evaluated by Duff\u00a0& Phelps, as of March\u00a011, 2004. Events occurring after March\u00a011, 2004, could materially affect the assumptions used in preparing its fairness opinion., 192499=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results for 2002 and 2003 reflect the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill under the provisions of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No.\u00a0142, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\", 295097=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On January\u00a020, 2004, Ecolab delivered a first draft of the merger agreement to Alcide. The merger agreement reflected a stock merger although Ecolab and Alcide had not yet agreed on the specific acquisition structure. From January\u00a021 to January\u00a031, 2004, representatives of Ecolab met with representatives of Alcide in Seattle and elsewhere in order to conduct further due diligence on such key topics as research and development, product registrations, intellectual property, legal matters, employment matters, employee benefits, tax matters, and information systems. During this same period, Alcide gathered and provided the bulk of the due diligence information requested by Ecolab and responded to follow-up questions. Partially as a result of these discussions and the information provided, Ecolab identified all four officers of Alcide and seven additional employees as important to achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger. However, the parties agreed that compensation and related discussions regarding the officers and other key employees would be postponed until the principal terms of the merger were further negotiated, including price and structure.}",
