The default value is defined by the compile-time constant DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUEST_FIELDS (100 as distributed)., 249514=This directive overrides the behavior of TRACE for both the core server and mod_proxy. The default TraceEnable on permits TRACE requests per RFC 2616, which disallows any request body to accompany the request. TraceEnable off causes the core server and mod_proxy to return a 405 (Method not allowed) error to the client., 267262=Copyright 2015 The Apache Software Foundation. Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0., 197635=Prior to 2.3.11, NameVirtualHost was required to instruct the server that a particular IP address and port combination was usable as a name-based virtual host. In 2.3.11 and later, any time an IP address and port combination is used in multiple virtual hosts, name-based virtual hosting is automatically enabled for that address., 185880=This option is provided for compatibility with releases prior to 2.4.11, where trailers were always merged., 192453=With the file-based mechanisms fcntl and flock, the path, if provided, is a directory where the lock file will be created. The default directory is httpd's run-time file directory relative to ServerRoot. Always use a local disk filesystem for /path/to/mutex and never a directory residing on a NFS- or AFS-filesystem. The basename of the file will be the mutex type, an optional instance string provided by the module, and unless the OmitPID keyword is specified, the process id of the httpd parent process will be appended to make the file name unique, avoiding conflicts when multiple httpd instances share a lock file directory. For example, if the mutex name is mpm-accept and the lock file directory is /var/httpd/locks, the lock file name for the httpd instance with parent process id 12345 would be /var/httpd/locks/mpm-accept.12345., 153808=The LimitRequestFieldSize directive allows the server administrator to set the limit on the allowed size of an HTTP request header field. A server needs this value to be large enough to hold any one header field from a normal client request. The size of a normal request header field will vary greatly among different client implementations, often depending upon the extent to which a user has configured their browser to support detailed content negotiation. SPNEGO authentication headers can be up to 12392 bytes., 96003=[Thu May 12 08:28:57.652118 2011] [core:error] [pid 8777:tid 4326490112] [client ::1:58619] File does not exist: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/favicon.ico, 44893=This directive enables the generation of Content-MD5 headers as defined in RFC1864 respectively RFC2616., 238818=After version 2.0.44, this directive also controls the information presented by the ServerSignature directive., 80096=From 2.4.13, expression syntax can be used inside the directive to produce dynamic strings and URLs., 235994=After version 2.0.44, the details of the server version number presented are controlled by the ServerTokens directive.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "For example, here's what would happen if you added modifiers to the %{Referer}i token, which logs the Referer request header. A number as modifier can be used to assign a log severity level to a format item. The item will only be logged if the severity of the log message is not higher than the specified log severity level. The number can range from 1 (alert) over 4 (warn) and 7 (debug) to 15 (trace8). The above behavior can be changed by adding modifiers to the format string item. A - (minus) modifier causes a minus to be logged if the respective item does not produce any output. In once-per-connection/request formats, it is also possible to use the + (plus) modifier. If an item with the plus modifier does not produce any output, the whole line is omitted. It can happen that some format string items do not produce output. For example, the Referer header is only present if the log message is associated to a request and the log message happens at a time when the Referer header has already been read from the client. If no output is produced, the default behavior is to delete everything from the preceding space character to the next space character. This means the log line is implicitly divided into fields on non-whitespace to whitespace transitions. If a format string item does not produce output, the whole field is omitted. For example, if the remote address %a in the log format [%t] [%l]",
