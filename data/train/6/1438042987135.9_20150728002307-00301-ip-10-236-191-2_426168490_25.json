The time stamped torque data may be displayed on a display integrated in the electronic torque tool or may be communicated to an external device. The real-time clock circuitry may be adjusted based on information received from an external device or may be manually input to a keypad of the electronic torque tool. A calibration timer integrated in the electronic torque tool monitors time between calibrations of the tool and notifies a user upon expiration of a calibration interval. A secondary power source is coupled to the real-time clock circuitry to maintain power to the real-time clock circuitry during battery replacement. 20140336955 11-13-2014 Method and System of Using an USB User Interface in an Electronic Torque Wrench - A communication port interface facilitates downloading of torque and/or angle log information from an electronic torque tool to an external device. Torque and/or angle preset job information may be entered in client software and uploaded from the external device to the electronic torque tool via the communication port interface. Additional information including real time clock information and wrench system parameters may be uploaded to the electronic torque tool via the communication port interface. 20140336810 09-20-2012 TOOL APPARATUS SYSTEM AND METHOD OF USE - A system, and a method of",
