Verleysen, editor, Proceedings of ESANN'99, pages 183-188, 1999, incorporated herein by reference, makes use of this idea., 609264=It has been shown that one cannot find a non-trivial kernel which is globally invariant (see C. J. C. Burges, \u201cGeometry and invariance in kernel based methods\u201d, B. Sch\ufffdlkopf, C. J. C. Burges, and A. J. Smola, editors, Advances in Kernel Methods\u2014Support Vector Learning.

Uthurusamy, editors, First International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining. AAAI Press, 1995, the best performance has been obtained for a polynomial kernel of degree 3,, 775457=In all methods described for training an invariant SVM, there is a parameter \u03b3 that must be chosen, which is a trade-off between maximization of the margin and enforcement of the invariances (see, e.g., Equation 71). One can set this parameter using a validation set or by gradient descent. (O. Chapelle, V. Vapnik, V. Bousquet, and S. Mukherjee, \u201cChoosing multiple parameters for support vector machines\u201d, Machine Learning, 2001.), 513534=The dataset consists of a set of curves coded as vectors of length 1688 and that are described as spectra. The task is to discriminate these spectra from a learning set built of 151 spectra of class 0 and 145 spectra of class 1. Thus, the learning set has a size of 296. The generalization set is not known: it is formed only by the spectra but not by the corresponding labels., 772416=A straightforward way to reduce the complexity is based on the method consisting of decomposition of the Gram matrix of the input vector described above. Here, a random subset of the training points of size m<<n is selected. Work is performed in the subspace E\u2032 spanned by those m points. In practice, this means that the kernel PCA map (Equation 88) can be computed only from the m training examples. However, there is a loss of information by projecting on E\u2032 instead of E, but if the eigenvalues of the kernel function decay quickly enough and m is large enough, \u2225PE(x)\u2212PE\u2032 (x)\u2225 should be small, where P is the projection operator.

Langley, editor, Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 911-918, San Francisco, 2000. Morgan Kaufman.), 526953=The same experiments were performed with a reduced number of features (the first 543 coordinates of each spectra and the coordinates 1177 to 1500, selected by taking the regions of the graphs that were most different between the two classes 1 and 0), resulting in a generalization error of 22.7% (\ufffd5%) with C=\u221e on the non-normalized learning set. (The same experiment was not performed with the normalized dataset.), 616279=An alternative to the foregoing is to directly modify the cost function in order to take into account the tangent vectors. This has been successfully applied to neural networks (P. Simard, Y. LeCun, J. Denker, and B. Victorri. \u201cTransformation invariance in pattern recognition, tangent distance and tangent propagation\u201d, G. Orr and K. M\ufffdller, editors, Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade.

In MIT Press, editor, NIPS, volume 10, 1998), both of which are incorporated herein by reference. According to the present embodiment of the invention, such methods are extended to the case of nonlinear SVMs, primarily by using kernel PCA (principal components analysis) methods. See, e.g., B. Sch\ufffdlkopf, A. Smola, and K. R. M\ufffdller. Nonlinear component analysis as a kernel eigenvatue problem. Neural Computation, 10:1299-1310, 1998, which is incorporated herein by reference., 800096=Invariances were incorporated for a hand-written digit recognition task. The USPS dataset have been used extensively in the past for this purpose by workers in the SVM field. This dataset consists of 7291 training and 2007 test examples., 808707=The method of the second embodiment of the present invention extends a method for constructing invariant hyperplanes to the nonlinear case. Results obtained with this new method are superior to the virtual SV method, the latter of which has recently broken the record on the NIST database which is the \u201cgold standard\u201d of handwritten digit benchmarks (see D. DeCoste and B. Sch\ufffdlkopf, \u201cTraining invariant support vector machines\u201d, Machine Learning, 2001.), 306004=As a third method, one could use K(s,t)=max k((s,i),(t,j)),\u2003\u2003(44) to obtain a notion of similarity that is invariant with respect to certain transformations of the index sets (e.g., translations of images), cf. the notion of \u2018kernel jittering\u2019 as discussed by D. DeCoste and M. C. Burl in \u201cDistortion-invariant recognition via jittered queries\u201d, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR-2000), June 2000., 803590=Following the experimental protocol described in B. Sch\ufffdlkopf, J. Shawe-Taylor, A. J. Smola, and R. C. Williamson, \u201cGeneralization bounds via eigenvalues of the Gram matrix\u201d, Technical Report 99-035, NeuroColt, 1999, the training set was split into 23 subsets of 317 training examples after a random permutation of the training and test set. The focus of the experiment was on a binary classification problem, namely separating digits 0 to 4 against 5 to 9. The gain in performance should also be valid for the multiclass case., 615437=A common method for introducing invariances in a learning system is to add the perturbed examples Ltxi in the training set (see P. Niyogi, T. Poggio, and F. Girosi, \u201cIncorporating prior information in machine learning by creating virtual examples\u201d, IEEE Proceedings on Intelligent Signal Processing, 86(11):2196-2209, November 1998). These points are often labeled \u201cvirtual examples\u201d. In the SVM (support vector machine) framework, when applied only to the SVs (support vectors), it leads to the \u201cVirtual Support Vector\u201d (\u201cVSV\u201d) method. See, e.g., B. Sch\ufffdlkopf, C. Burges, and V. Vapnik. \u201cIncorporating invariances in support vector learning machines\u201d, Artificial Neural Networks\u2014ICANN'96, volume 1112, pages 47-52, Berlin, 1996.

A parallel interface 1043 connects synchronous peripheral devices, such as a laser printer 1056, to the I/O bus 1026. A serial interface 1044 connects communication devices to the I/O bus 1026. A user may enter commands and information into the computer 1000 via the serial interface 1044 or by using an input device, such as a keyboard 1038, a mouse 1036 or a modem 1057.

The device interfaces may include both hardware components and software components. For instance, a hard disk drive 1030 and a floppy disk drive 1032 for reading or writing removable media 1050 may be connected to the I/O bus 1026 through disk drive controllers 1040. An optical disk drive 1034 for reading or writing optical media 1052 may be connected to the I/O bus 1026 using a Small Computer System Interface (\u201cSCSI\u201d) 1041. Alternatively, an IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics, i.e., a hard disk drive interface for PCs), ATAPI (ATtAchment Packet Interface, i.e., CD-ROM and tape drive interface), or EIDE (Enhanced IDE) interface may be associated with an optical drive such as may be the case with a CD-ROM drive. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage for the computer 1000. In addition to the computer-readable media described above, other types of computer-readable media may also be used, such as ZIP drives, or the like.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Alternative embodiments of the present invention will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains. Such alternate embodiments are considered to be encompassed within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is described by the appended claims and is supported by the foregoing description. The method of the second embodiment of the present invention extends a method for constructing invariant hyperplanes to the nonlinear case. Results obtained with this new method are superior to the virtual SV method, the latter of which has recently broken the record on the NIST database which is the \u201cgold standard\u201d of handwritten digit benchmarks (see D. DeCoste and B. Sch\ufffdlkopf, \u201cTraining invariant support vector machines\u201d, Machine Learning, 2001.) The favorable results obtained in the digit recognition task prompted additional experiments on another dataset consisting of mass spectrograms. For each training sample there were two measurements, allowing construction of one noise vector. The techniques described herein yielded significant improvements over standard SVMs and the VSV method. Note that the digit recognition experiments can be considered as an instance of this problem: the camera is never positioned in such a way that the digit falls exactly in the middle of the bitmap. In other words, there is a \u201cposition noise\u201d. The replicates should be seen as identical to the original training",
