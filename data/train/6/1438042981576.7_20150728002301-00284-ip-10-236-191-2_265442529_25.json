The record includes one parameter -- the fully qualified name of the class representing the given project, e.g. WebProject, PhpProject, FreeformProject. USG_PROJECT_OPEN The generic project events are logged at the common project UI level. The most important and in most cases the only information that can be tracked at this level is the type of project being created, opened, or configured. The respective event records don't include information that is project type specific, such as target servers, or special configuration parameters. For such information, refer to the Specialized Project Events. The generic project events are still useful when calculating the basic distribution of application types developed by users.
