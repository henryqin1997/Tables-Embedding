Thrombin then converts the soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin strands. These strands are then cross-linked by factor XIII to form a blood clot. FXIIa stabilizes fibrin further by incorporation of the fibrinolysis inhibitors alpha-2-antiplasmin and TAFI (thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, procarboxypeptidase B), and binding to several adhesive proteins of various cells.[4] Both the activation of factor XIII by thrombin and plasminogen activator (t-PA) are catalyzed by fibrin.[4] Fibrin specifically binds the activated coagulation factors factor Xa and thrombin and entraps them in the network of fibers, thus functioning as a temporary inhibitor of these enzymes, which stay active and can be released during fibrinolysis.[5] Research from 2011 has shown that fibrin plays a key role in the inflammatory response and development of rheumatoid arthritis.[6][citation needed], 98533=Yang Z, Kollman JM, Pandi L, Doolittle RF; , Biochemistry. 2001;40:12515-12523.: Crystal structure of native chicken fibrinogen at 2.7 A resolution.
