            "I feel JSU is a very safe campus. there are so many street lights and buildings located around campus that you are never anywhere that would make you feel unsafe. The UPD is always on the lookout (ALWAYS, meaning parking, safety, etc.) They have your back...",
            "Greek Life here at JSU is so awesome! I was a part of Zeta Tau Alpha for my first semester. I loved everything I got out of it. While It was not something I continued in, I still recommend going greek for anyone that is interested. You learn so much that prepares you for the real world and you get a bunch of incredibly sisters or brothers for the rest of your life. You have a ton of fun making floats for homecoming or participating in different types of pageants held by the other sororities or fraternities. Because JSU is a smaller school, the chapters are not huge and that way you can know every single one of your sisters/brothers so much easier that you would had a large university.",
            "JSU offers soooo many clubs and activities to be a part of. You can ask anyone and they will probably list multiple things they are involved it. You don't have to be super outgoing or talkative to be a part of them either. There is a place for EVERYONE.",
            "If you aren't too sure that you want to leave home or not, Jacksonville is the perfect place to be. It is small enough to not be too scary and big enough to still feel apart of that college feel. It is so much fun and I love being here.",
            "Being a freshman, I haven't been able to really see all the traditions at JSU. I was in a sorority for the first semester and I got to see a lot of the student participation in things that go on on campus.",
            "Yes, it is college. yes, tuition is expensive, but the college experience that comes from being here at JSU is so worth it. I believe the size of the University really helps with that. It is just big enough to have that university feel and it is just small enough to really be involved with as much as you want. If you work hard enough you can definitely be recognized here. It is like living in a small town, you start to recognize everyone's face after a little bit so you begin to feel comfortable and become yourself in everything you do.",
            "If you aren't into the whole sorority or fraternity thing (which really is so fun), there are so many other things to do for fun on campus. Student Activities are held weekly and we do things such as Movies on Dillion Field or maybe dress up as historical figures for Black History Month. There are also so many sports here at JSU and most of the time there is a game going on which you get into FREE with your Student ID. THere are so many clubs to join too. Anywhere from the Earth and Nature Club to SAC (student activities club) or maybe the BCM (Baptist Student Ministry). Whatever you are interested in we are sure to have something for you here!",
            "The food is great here! You have so many options to choose from. If you are living in a dorm, you have to get a meal plan. If you are like me, 5 foot 2 inches and cant eat your weight every single meal, you can always buy other people's food with your flex and show love to the people that maybe can't afford lunch at the TMB. It is a little expensive, but you have to pay it considering you live in the dorms. But breakfast in the cafeteria on the weekends is by far the best! It is delicious!",
            "Yes, as a freshman, you have to live in the dorms. I lived in Logan and it is actually not that bad. If you have someone you get a long with as a roommate then it will be much easier to handle. They are safe and suitable for living there for a year. No worries are needed, it is only for 9 months.",
            "The teachers and professors could not be more friendly and helpful. I have not had one that was not willing to help me with my grades if I was struggling.",
            "Really try to get involved on campus when you start as a freshman. There are so many areas to plug in and there is always something out there regardless of what you do or who you are.",
            "The campus is absolutely beautiful and well laid out. I love the size of the university and the classrooms have a perfect number of students, not too many or not too few. All the sports are free to go to on campus with your ID so it is easy to show support when you are no longer an athlete (retired softball syndrome)."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Anyone!!! Jacksonville is a great school that makes you feel good as a group and not a single number. Tips for prospective students Some tips that I believe are highly important are to be on time to class, don't bum your first test, and have fun but keep your grades up so you dont have to end up dropping any classes or getting a NC (no credit) for the class. First off, being on time is important because some teachers don't allow tardys and you don't want to get an absence just because you were 5 minutes late. Second, I learned this the hard way. Aim high for your first test. Study, Study, Study!!! Some teachers only have 3 tests for the entire semester so if you mess up on one you may not be able to pull out with that A you wanted. So take the first test seriously and learn from the test so you recognize how the format of the tests are. Last but not least have fun and keep your grades up because college is fun and everything but remember you don't want to be in college for the rest of your life just because you goofed of in Biology class. Bang for the buck From financial aid to scholarships to",
