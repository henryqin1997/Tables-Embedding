    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70513=The album spans from an early, chaotic 1977 punk-era show which includes their classics such as \u2018Shoplifting\u2019, \u2018New Town\u2019 and \u2018Love & Romance\u2019, shows how they evolved into their dubby, reggae-influenced style with songs such as \u2018Typical Girls\u2019, and finishes with a track from their last ever performance in 1981.\u00a0, 75702=Budgie was replaced by Bruce Smith of The Pop Group, with which group grew an association with both a shared single and managers Christine Robertson and Dick O\u2019Dell.\u00a0 In 1980 indie singles \u2018In The Beginning There Was Rhythm\u2019, \u2018Man Next Door\u2019 and \u2018Animal Space\u2019 followed.\u00a0 Musicianship became more of a priority, with Steve Beresford accompanying them, and a more experimental, world music spirit permeated their work.\u00a0 Then a new contract with CBS produced the \u2018Return Of The Giant Slits\u2019 album in October 1981.\u00a0 Two months later, they held their final gig at Hammersmith Palais, announcing that they had no more plans as a group., 73948=After a few gigs they were invited by the Clash to support them on the \u2018White Riot\u2019 tour.\u00a0 The band quickly acquired a violent, chaotic image, attacking bands like Sore Throat and Throbbing Gristle on stage, and chosen by Derek Jarman to trash cars in his 1977 film \u2018Jubilee\u2019.\u00a0 Their music fitted the image - shambolic and loud, with abrasive guitar, shouted choruses, and crazy Ari\u2019s screeched vocals over Palmolive\u2019s hammered, stuttering drums., 74456=Their uncompromising attitude, combined with gleefully subverting any and every notion of traditional female behaviour - skirts raised over heads, obscene and aggressive gestures, indeed anything to put the shits up people - scared the A&R men away.\u00a0 Peel Sessions in \u201977 and \u201978 was all the public got to hear, apart from gigs, which included tours with the Buzzcocks and Rich Kids.\u00a0 Other punk bands who\u2019d taken their time - Siouxsie & The Banshees, Adam & The Ants - eventually got signed in 1978, but not the unpredictable, unmanageable Slits., 69868=Debuting with their 1977 tour with The Clash, The Slits were known for their uncompromising attitude and aggressive and confrontational music; to this day they are cited as being hugely inspiring to many female artists.\u00a0, 76787=SMALL PRINT: Payment Paypal is smoothly integrated into ebay, and works well.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t have PayPal or want to pay by credit-card, you can still do so through PayPal.\u00a0 Just don\u2019t log into an account, and look for the button saying \u2018Pay by credit-card\u2019.\u00a0 We also accept cheques from UK banks in Pounds Sterling, and UK Postal Orders.\u00a0 Checks in US Dollars from US banks can be accepted with a $3 surcharge.\u00a0 PayPal eCheques and orders paid by any method outside of PayPal may take longer to process and be subject to delays. Postage UK and particularly international postage charges have risen sharply (May 2012).\u00a0 The amount we charge is what we expect to pay plus approx 20-30p for packing materials.\u00a0 Multiple items postage If you are ordering multiple items, there will be automatic approximated reduction in postage costs \u2013 but make sure you order them together, not individually.\u00a0 If the estimate still looks excessive, don't pay but click on the 'Request total from seller' button in the shopping basket.\u00a0 We'll then recalculate the costs for your combined items postage and send you an invoice.\u00a0 The postage may or may not calculate as less; we\u2019re trying to refine the accuracy of the automation. (Note: the date printed on our postage is two days after we print it, ie the date it remains valid until with Royal Mail.) Problem? We want you to be really happy with your purchase.\u00a0 If you\u2019re not, or something\u2019s gone wrong, please message us.\u00a0 We will do our very best to resolve any problem.\u00a0 If our item description isn\u2019t quite right, or you think we\u2019ve overcharged on postage, please let us know instead of marking down our ebay feedback.\u00a0 If you have an order problem you\u2019d like to resolve quickly, you can try phoning us on +44(0)208 537 3445.\u00a0 Good manners are appreciated! Ebay Messaging The ebay messaging system doesn\u2019t include your name, date of purchase or payment, or even the order reference number.\u00a0 It\u2019ll help us deal with your query faster if you can include those.\u00a0 Please remember, the ebay shop is not our main business so we may not always respond immediately; but we will get back to you., 75077=Record companies telling them they \u2018weren\u2019t tight enough\u2019 led them to part company with Palmolive and her trademark drum style.\u00a0 Her replacement was Budgie from seminal Liverpool group Big In Japan (later a Banshee and Creature).\u00a0 But by the time of their long-awaited debut album \u2018Cut\u2019 on Island in 1979, they had become bored with punk.\u00a0 They embraced reggae, working with producer Dennis Bovell, who pared down their songs and gave them a dubby mix.\u00a0 The sleeve, showing them proudly and defiantly naked and covered in mud, guaranteed them attention., 70191=But even their seminal Island Records 1979 debut album \u2018Cut\u2019, with its infamous sleeve featuring the band members naked and caked in mud, does not capture the true energy and spontaneity as well as these live recordings do.\u00a0, 69529=THE SLITS \u2018IN THE BEGINNING\u2019 (A Live Anthology 1977-81)}",
