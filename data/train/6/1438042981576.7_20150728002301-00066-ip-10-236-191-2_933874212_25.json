The rule sets forth the procedures for detention of drugs believed to be adulterated or misbranded and amends the scope of FDA's part 16 regulatory hearing procedures to include the administrative detention of drugs.

In response to the comments received on these foundational FSMA proposed rules, FDA issued supplemental notices of proposed rulemaking that propose significant changes to four of the proposed rules including: Current Good Manufacturing Practice and Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food (Preventive Controls for Human Food); Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption (Produce Safety); Current Good Manufacturing Practice and Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals (Preventive Controls for Animal Food); and Foreign Supplier Verification Programs for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals (Foreign Supplier Verification Programs). The purpose of the public meeting is to solicit oral stakeholder and public comments on the new content of the supplemental proposed rules and to inform the public about the rulemaking process (including how to submit comments, data, and other information to the rulemaking dockets), and to respond to questions about the supplemental proposed rules., 79378=The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is announcing the availability of a guidance for industry entitled \u201cFDA Records Access Authority Under Sections 414 and 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\u201d The guidance provides updated information pertaining to FDA's authority to access and copy records relating to food. It is a revision of FDA's November 2005 guidance entitled \u201cGuidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Guidance for Records Access Authority Provided in Title III, Subtitle A, of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002; Final Guidance.\u201d, 21247=\u00a7 1490 - General orders, 20698=\u00a7 1454 - Rules and regulations, 64513=The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is extending the comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking that appeared in the Federal Register of February 5, 2014, entitled \u201cSanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food\u201d and its information collection provisions. We are taking this action in response to requests for an extension to allow interested persons additional time to submit comments. We also are taking this action to keep the comment period for the information collection provisions associated with the rule consistent with the comment period for the proposed rule., 20432=\u00a7 1333 - Labeling, 24638=Title 21 published on 2014-04-01, 20511=\u00a7 1453 - Requirements of labeling; placement, form, and contents of statement of quantity; supplemental statement of quantity, 54297=The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is revising certain provisions of the proposed rule, issued in July 2013, on foreign supplier verification programs (FSVPs) for importers of food for humans and animals. We are primarily revising the proposed requirements concerning compliance status review of food and foreign suppliers, hazard analysis, and supplier verification activities. We are taking this action in response to the extensive public input we have received regarding these provisions and in coordination with revisions we are concurrently making to the proposed rule on current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) and hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls for human food. We are seeking public comment on the revised proposed FSVP regulations. We are reopening the comment period on the proposed rule only with respect to the specific provisions identified in this Federal Register document., 49201=The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to amend our 2013 proposed rule for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) and Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food. In that 2013 proposed rule, we proposed to amend the CGMP requirements to modernize them and to add requirements for certain domestic and foreign facilities to establish and implement hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls for human food. We also proposed to revise certain definitions in our current regulation for Registration of Food Facilities to clarify the scope of an exemption from registration requirements for \u201cfarms\u201d and, in so doing, to clarify which domestic and foreign facilities would be subject to the proposed requirements for hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls for human food. We are taking this action because the extensive input we have received from public comments has led to significant changes in our current thinking on certain key provisions of these proposed rules. We are reopening the comment period only with respect to specific issues identified in this proposed rule.}",
