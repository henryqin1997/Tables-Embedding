Note: If this operation requires a web service request that is provided either in a request file, or directly written out in the tool call (<XML Request>). This request file can have two different formats (XML which correspons to the XML body only or SOAP which corrsponds to the full-formed SOAP envelope including a SOAP header and body) specified in the RESPONSE_FILE_FORMAT parameter. The response of the web service request is written to an XML file that can be processed afterwards in Oracle Data Integrator. If the web service operation is one-way and does not return any response, no response file is generated. This tool invokes a specific operation on a port of a web service whose description file (WSDL) URL is provided. Use this command to invoke a web service over HTTP/HTTPS and write the response to an XML file. This tool replaces the OdiExecuteWebService tool.
