            "Spend time learning the library and dress professional if you want to be taken seriously by your peers. If you do not take your own education seriously the educators will not take you seriously. The point is if you want to be treated like a respectful adult then act and dress the part.",

Like the tradition to silly string the whole campus on April fools day, or dressing up for costume contests in October.
