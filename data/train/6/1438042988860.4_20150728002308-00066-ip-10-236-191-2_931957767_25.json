The amendment would remove the December 31, 2018 termination date for the phased-in compliance schedule for futures commission merchants (\u201cFCMs\u201d) and provide assurance that the Residual Interest Deadline would only be revised through a separate Commission rulemaking., 46760=On December 12, 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (the \u201cPosition Limits Proposal\u201d) to establish speculative position limits for 28 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and options contracts and the physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts. On November 15, 2013, the Commission published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (the \u201cAggregation Proposal\u201d) to amend existing regulations setting out the Commission's policy for aggregation under its position limits regime. On December 9, 2014, the Commission's Agricultural Advisory Committee held a public meeting that considered, among other matters, deliverable supply and exemptions for bona fide hedging positions. In conjunction with the meeting of the Commission's Agricultural Advisory Committee, the Commission posted questions and presentation materials on the Commission's Web site; additionally, access to a video webcast of the meeting has been added to the Web site. To provide commenters with a sufficient period of time to respond to questions raised and points made at the Agricultural Advisory Committee meeting, the Commission reopened the comment periods for an additional 45 days, from December 9, 2014 to January 22, 2015. The Commission is providing notice and clarification that, in addition to commenting on the agenda issues noted in the December 4, 2014, Federal Register release providing notice of the re-opened comment period, comments may be made on the issues addressed at the meeting or in the associated materials posted to the Commission's Web site, as they pertain to agricultural commodities., 22122=Title 17 published on 2014-04-01, 90299=On December 12, 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (the \u201cPosition Limits Proposal\u201d) to establish speculative position limits for 28 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and options contracts and the physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts. On November 15, 2013, the Commission published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (the \u201cAggregation Proposal\u201d) to amend existing regulations setting out the Commission's policy for aggregation under its position limits regime. The Commission has directed staff to hold a public roundtable on June 19, 2014, to consider certain issues regarding position limits for physical commodity derivatives. In order to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the issues to be discussed at the roundtable, the Commission will reopen the comment periods for the Position Limits Proposal and the Aggregation Proposal for a three-week period starting June 12, 2014 (one week before the roundtable) and ending July 3, 2014 (two weeks following the roundtable). Comments should be limited to the issues of hedges of a physical commodity by a commercial enterprise, including gross hedging, cross-commodity hedging, anticipatory hedging, and the process for obtaining a non-enumerated exemption; the setting of spot month limits in physical-delivery and cash-settled contracts and a conditional spot-month limit exemption; the setting of non-spot limits for wheat contracts; the aggregation exemption for certain ownership interests of greater than 50 percent in an owned entity; and aggregation based on substantially identical trading strategies., 16551=The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) is correcting final rules published in the Federal Register of November 14, 2013 (\u201cfinal rules\u201d). Those rules, which adopted new regulations and amended existing regulations requiring enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures, and auditing and examination programs for futures commission merchants, took effect on January 13, 2014. This correction amends erroneous cross-references found in three sections of the final rules. Additionally, this correction amends one section of the final rules to insert language that was in the proposed rulemaking, and which was stated as being adopted in the preamble to the final rules, but was erroneously omitted from the final rule text., 40510=On December 12, 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (the \u201cPosition Limits Proposal\u201d) to establish speculative position limits for 28 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and options contracts and the physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts.

The Commission's Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee has scheduled a public meeting to be held on February 26, 2015, which will consider, among other matters, exemptions for bona fide hedging positions. In conjunction with the meeting of the Commission's Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee, the Commission will post an agenda and associated materials, if any, on the Commission's Web site; additionally, access to a video webcast of the meeting will be added to the Web site. In addition, and in connection with the meeting, the Commission is providing counts of the unique persons over percentages of the 28 proposed position limit levels (currently provided in Table 11 of the Position Limits Proposal based on counts from the period of January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012 period) in a new table, Table 11a, based on counts from the period of January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014. To provide commenters with a sufficient period of time to respond to questions raised and points made at the Energy and Environmental Markets Committee meeting, as well as to provide an opportunity to comment on Table 11a, the Commission will reopen the comment periods for an additional 30 days. The Commission is providing notice that comments may be made on the issues addressed at the meeting or in the associated materials posted to the Commission's Web site, as they pertain to energy commodities. Furthermore, comments may be made on Table 11a, showing counts of the unique persons over percentages of the 28 proposed position limit levels based on counts from the period of January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014., 80153=On December 12, 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (the \u201cPosition Limits Proposal\u201d) to establish speculative position limits for 28 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and options contracts and the physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts.

Those rules, 17 CFR Parts 1, 3, 22, 30, and 140, took effect on January 13, 2014.
