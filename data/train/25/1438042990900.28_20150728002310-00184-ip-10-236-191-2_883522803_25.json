    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students This place is great for first time students because it gives them the opportunity to see how college life is about. They won't make a mistake on a decision on a school they decided to go. So Palo Alto College is a great place to begin a career. Bang for the buck This school is a good place where your money does not get thrown away. Getting in is very affordable many students do not think they could go to college and they see that they could afford it and get a career. This school is very helpful for people that really needed. Am enjoying being here I really do enjoy being here because I have made so many friends here already. For me personally is great, it is close to home, so many things I can do to pass time and its a clean environment. Am learning a lot This school is great for a learning environment. This is a community college the professors here are great, they want to help the students. Overall a good place to start",
