    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{303931=Murray State also has some pretty interesting traditions and fun locations. Every April, we have All Campus Sing, a lip-syncing contest that has become a campus tradition. Also, we have the Shoe Tree. The Shoe Tree is a fun, though odd, tradition. If a couple met at MSU and later get married, they can come back and put a shoe on the tree commemorating the occasion. One of the most untapped locations on campus is Pogue Library. Pogue is full of antiques and cool silence--a perfect combination for studying...or napping!, 272342=The shoe tree- If two students meet at Murray State, fall in love and then marry, they will have good luck if each partner nails a shoe to the shoe tree. Great beginnings - To ease new students into the Murray State swing of things, the university created its Great Beginnings program. Tent city -Every homecoming football game needs a good round of tailgating to set it up, but MurrayState has its own approach to meeting and greeting. All campus sing -Each April since 1958, students, faculty, staff and local residents alike crowd the lawn in front of Lovett Auditorium for the Sigma Alpha Iota-sponsored All Campus Sing. Campus light - Started in 1938, Campus Lights is the longest-running musical that is entirely produced and performed by students in the South. Phi Mu Alpha Racer One's Celebratory Lap - Since 1976, every home-game touchdown is marked by a thoroughbred, nicknamed Racer One, running a celebration lap on the running track around the football field. Homecoming Parade - On the morning of homecoming, hand-crafted floats line up around the Murray square and student organizations parade along Main Street to Murray State\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s campus, greeting and passing out candy and party favors to the other students and residents crowding the street Midnight Breakfast- When students hit the books, they tend to forsake good eating habits. That's why for the last several years, Murray State has offered students a hearty meal to fuel their late-night preparation of final exams. Citation : http://www.murraystate.edu/Campus/traditions.aspx, 313137=My particular major, elementary education, is ranked as the number one education program in the state of Kentucky as of 2014. The teachers are dedicated and knowledgable. The classes are challenging but gratifying!, 245724=The shoe tree is a tradition on campus. If a couple meets at Murray State and later get married, they bring their shoes back and hang them on the tree. then they bring shoes for every child they have. All Campus Sing is another tradition here at Murray. it is held during an afternoon in April. Clubs, organizations, residential colleges, sororities and fraternities put groups together and perform their shows on the steps of Lovett Auditorium. I was lucky enough to be a part of the winning group from the residential college division this year and I'm glad I got the opportunity to do so., 73537=Go to the sporting events! Murray State Racer Basketball creates an electric environment in the CFSB Center. We've been ranked by ESPN as one of the Top 30 Basketball programs since 1980. Aside from sports, Murray has a bowling alley, a movie theater, local shopping, several restaurants, and is close to Kentucky Lake and the Land Between the Lakes. So if you want to get away, there is a large campground area on the lake that is absolutely beautiful. It's a small town environment, but it's close to a lot of things to do., 94944=I have not yet attended the school yet, I start 1/17/2012, but after looking through a few of my class outlines and a syllabus I can tell that I will definitely have to study a lot and focus on my schooling. It seems to be a lot more challenging than the Community College I attended in the fall., 316347=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 31190=I am really enjoying my time here. I graduated a year early in June from my high school in the mountains in NC and came straight to Murray after graduation and have been attending classes since. I love both the location and the community. the people here in Murray are some of the nicest you will meet and are always willing to lend a hand., 71611=Murray is one of the safest towns in Kentucky, and was named the Friendliest Small Town in America in 2012 by Rand McNally! Crime is low and students especially are very, very safe.}",
