            "The campus is pretty much safe seeing as how you have to go past the security booth before entering the main campus. Most freshman stay across the street in their designated dorms, which are gated and has its own little security booth. Only those freshman have key access to the gates.",
            "The Greeks keep campus alive and fun. Their mini performances during gym parties get the whole school involved. The students love cheering on the fraternities and sororities.",
            "There is: tennis, volleyball, track & field, basketball, football, modeling troupes, a cheerleading squad, and so much more.",
            "JCSU is great for students who like a small campus with small classes, where everbody knows everybody.",
            "On designated Thursdays, at 10:10 pm, campus clubs and organizations make-up short performances for all students to get an insight on what they are all about.",
            "Johnson C. Smith University is a private institute so there is no in-state/out-of-state tuition; everyone pays the same amount for tuition. Teachers are so involved in the students' academic progress, as well as satisfying graduation requirements, such as community service projects.",
            "Via bus, there's several malls, movies, and restaurants. If you have a car though, there's so much more. Clubs, bowling, skating, facilities for outdoor activities (mountain climbing, whitewater rafting, etc.), museums and much more!",
            "Food could use a little improvement but still good nonetheless.",
            "Dorms are nice and clean. Great housekeeping staff.",
            "Nice, small classrooms. You have the ability to get to know your professors and vice versa. You can actually learn and engage in the lessons versus taking endless notes in a class of 400 students.",
            "Manage your time well. Do not get so involved with the party life that you forget why you're attending the school in the first place. Get to know your professors, as well as your peers, because you'll need someone's help before you graduate. Don't forget to enjoy your college career and still try to have fun!",
            "A wonderful school with small class proportions. Great sense of community there. Located in Charlotte, the Queen City."

I am eager and excited to be,a part of JCSU this fall., 152744=The dorms are a bit old. They are pretty run down and used.

During the Golden Bull Academy which is a Program for incoming freshman I learned so much. Most importantly the school made me feel at home.
