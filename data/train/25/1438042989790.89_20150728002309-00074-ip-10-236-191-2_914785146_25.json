            "Pretty good, CSCC sends out text messages and emails whenever something pops up to make sure all the students stay safe and aware. Campus Security is always near by.",
            "I'm not sure if there is Greek life at CSCC.",
            "There are exercise classes (zumba, yoga, boxing, etc.), culture clubs and the theater is always putting on a new show. There is something for everyone.",
            "Students who aren't sure of what they want to do or where they want to go and those who are looking for a career change. The classes are affordable, financial aid is available and the classes will prepare your for what comes next.",
            "Christopher Columbus. If you ever get lost, just look for the giant statue of Christopher Columbus, he's in the center of everything.",
            "If you are looking for a degree that will jump start you right after college, ASL is the way to go. CSCC has an arrangement with The Wexner Medical Center and most of CSCC's students are welcomed and desired at their locations.",
            "Act! The theater is great, and there is always a chance for anyone and everyone to audition. Test your comfort zone, make new friends and see a whole different side of campus life.",
            "The Cafe is actually pretty good. There are a number of selections from Pizza to Sushi. The prices are alright, but it tends to get really busy really quickly. Tip: There are more microwaves than the one just in the cafe, the bookstore snack shop has one, and Nestor Hall's lounge has one.",
            "There are no dorms here at CSCC. Though there a number of great places to live that are near by.",
            "So-so. Just because CSCC is a community college, it doesn't mean the classes are super easy. Many of the professors also teach at OSU or have taught at other universities. You will still have your work cut out for you.",
            "The classes here are great for getting your general classes done at a good price, but make sure that your credits will transfer to your university of choice.",
            "Get in. Get out. Get done."

I really enjoy attending this college because they have everything that I was looking for, and the professors are great and very helpful. I fell hard on times with some family issues, and the counselors offered me help in my situation and were very caring, I took a quarter off so that I can get my life in order so that I can focus on school when I go back. I plan to go back in the winter to finish out my degree., 526926=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 55453=campus safety disappointed me a bit. in the winter 2011 my car had an engine problem. i couldn't get home and was stuck in the parking lot. i didn't know what was wrong with my car at that time, because it would start but not drive faster than 10mph. i called campus safety but was rejected. i had to call a friend of mine to pick me up. later i found out that i was out of transmission fluid, and my car wouldn't shift., 73861=1) if you do not know how to use a computer very well, take a basic computer course before taking an english or history class. 2) do all of the blueprint workshops before enrolling in classes 3) see if you qualify for trio 4) if you get a non-student job on campus, you'll have access to parking spaces, and possibly have benefits. 5) buy books on craigslist 6) if you arrive at 7:30 parking is a piece of cake; 7:45 and you will be late to class. 7) Best secluded study areas are on the 3rd floor of the library, the basement of Nestor, and the group study rooms in the library. 8)}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students CSCC is great for students that are unsure of what they want to major in, because they have a lot of classes to choose from and most of them transfer to other schools. Tips for prospective students Definitely check out the teacher reviews and sign up as early as possible for unique classes because they fill up fast! Bang for the buck I'm taking a lot of classes and it is not as expensive as I was expecting, and with the right teacher its worth the money. Am enjoying being here Columbus is a wonderful city, and the people on campus are friendly and fun! Am learning a lot I have only attended one quarter so far, but in this one quarter I haven't felt like I've learned a whole lot. I felt like two out of three of my teachers didn't really care if we were learning anything or not. I had e-mailed both of these professors and neither replied to any of them yet would tell me in class that they did receive my e-mails. I just wish they would have answered my questions better.",
