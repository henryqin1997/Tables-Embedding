The interrupter system includes a source-side conductor, a load side conductor, and an interrupter. A source-side voltage detector is positioned proximate to the source-side conductor and a load-side voltage detector is positioned proximate to the load-side conductor. An insulating overmold encases both conductors, both voltage detectors, and the interrupter. A controller is coupled to both of the detectors and is configured to detect a source-side voltage and a load-side voltage. 20120261384 Published Description Patent application number William W. Chen, Munster, IN US 06-04-2015 IMPACT RESISTANT BATTERY ENCLOSURE SYSTEMS - Battery enclosure arrangements for a vehicular battery system. The arrangements, capable of impact resistance include plurality of battery cells and a plurality of kinetic energy absorbing elements. The arrangements further include a frame configured to encase the plurality of the kinetic energy absorbing elements and the battery cells. In some arrangements the frame and/or the kinetic energy absorbing elements can be made of topologically interlocked materials. 20150155534 Published Description Patent application number Weinong Wayne Chen, West Lafayette, IN US 04-23-2015 SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ANALYZING A SAMPLE - The invention generally relates to systems and methods for sample analysis.
