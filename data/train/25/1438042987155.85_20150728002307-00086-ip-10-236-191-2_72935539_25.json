The publication creator assigns the table weight to publication items within a specific publication. This value can be an integer between 1 and 1023. For example, a publication can have more than one publication item of weight \"2\" which would have INSERT operations performed after those for any publication item of a lower weight within the same publication. You define the order weight for tables when you add a publication item to the publication. See Section 2.4.1.7.2, \"Using Table Weight\" for more information., 128668=Section 2.4.1.13, \"Callback Customization for DML Operations\", 304265=Create a custom DML procedure.

If, for example, you have 2000 clients, having all 2000 clients request a download at the same time could overrun your server and cause a performance issue. In this scenario, you could take control of the notification process and notify 100 clients at a time over the span of a couple of hours. This way, all of the clients receive the data in a timely fashion and your server is not overrun., 251001=The AfterSyncMapCleanup procedure is called at the end of the map cleanup. If you set any parameters in the BeforeSyncMapCleanup callback, you can set them back to the original settings in this procedure. See Section 2.7.1.10, \"BeforeSyncMapCleanup\" for more information., 160772=Specify the time (PARAM_START_TIME) for an automatic synchronization to start. The format of time is standard date string: H24:MI:SS e.g. 00:00:00 or 23:59:00 The time is GMT. If not set, the synchronization starts when the Sync Agent starts and all other conditions are satisfied Set the period (PARAM_PERIOD), in seconds, to specify the frequency of scheduled synchronization events., 173524=See Section 2.4.1.12, \"Modifying a Publication Item\" for details on how to change the definition., 243292=Section 2.7.1.12, \"Example Using the Customize Package\", 73462=Select Specify Time if you want to automatically synchronize at a specific hour, such as 8:00 AM, everyday., 128788=Section 2.4.1.14, \"Restricting Predicate\", 243194=Section 2.7.1.11, \"AfterSyncMapCleanup\", 243406=Section 2.7.1.13, \"Error Handling For CUSTOMIZE Package\", 35969=If this parameter is set to 1000, Oracle Database Lite calls commits for every 1000 inserts.
