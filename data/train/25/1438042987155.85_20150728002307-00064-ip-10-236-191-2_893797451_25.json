    "textAfterTable": "i found a great beginning to my education at national university with my admissions counselor. he was able to refer me to my financial counselor and plan my academic schedule completely. In three sentences national university has a comprehensive administration set up that makes registration and educational planning easier than i've seen at any other institution. i was able to become enrolled and begin my education path easily after a 10 year break, with classes that weren't over my head and instructors that answered all my questions and were very approachable. i would definitely recommend national university to any of my friends or family for furthering their education.
