Usage Guidelines To use this command, you must be in a user group associated with a task group that includes appropriate task IDs. If the user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for assistance. Use the address family command to place the router or interface in address family configuration mode. In router address family configuration mode, you can configure routing that uses standard IPv4 or IPv6 address prefixes. An address family must be specified in interface configuration mode. In interface address family configuration mode, you can alter interface parameters for IPv4or IPv6. You must specify an",
