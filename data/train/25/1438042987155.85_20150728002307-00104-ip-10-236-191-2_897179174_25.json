            "safety is great on campus. the town of greenville does have a bit of crime but almost all is off campus and in situations late at night in the rough areas of town.",
            "i am not involved but there is a greek life.",
            "specifically our relay for life team is great. we were one of the top schools for raising money for cancer awareness and thousands of people participate in the all night event each year. it is a lot of fun. there is also a large amount of clubs thorough the gym where you can go on camping and water rafting trips etc...",
            "if you are independent, driven, social, and curious i think ecu is great for anyone with these qualities.",
            "one unusual spot is the four columns which lead to the joyner library. the person who donated money to build it put in a sensory reader that creates different wind chime like tones when you walk through it. it is something i have never seen at any other place and it always makes for a memorable moment in the day.",
            "having the access to our library is the biggest and greatest privilege for me. i make a routine of going to the art section and finding out about another artist, their life and work almost daily. it has led me on so much discovery of other subjects, and other literature which have all added to my life. so many ideas, and discoveries are inspired by reading as many books as possible. the staff at the libraries and the amount of books and resources we have really gives you no limit to what knowledge you can achieve.",
            "there is so much to do. i especially like going to the gym and go for runs and swims with a few of my friends at a time. also, the middle of our campus called the mall is a beautiful green. when the weather is great it is fun to go play frisbee or lie out a blanket and read. there is also many art galleries downtown which i love to check out and local restaurants. it is the perfect college town.",
            "the dinning halls here are great, healthy food is always available, and the staff is lovely. one woman particularly for breakfast makes my morning, and you can find any food you like on campus. it really is great and the meal plans make life a lot easier.",
            "i particularly love my dorm this semester. i have my own room and it is in the perfect location. i also like living around a lot of other people, and i think it is a good way to meet people and experience the dorm life, which you will not have after college.",
            "depending on your professor, there are difficult and more challenging courses. i try and take from a class as much as i can and focus on points of interest that will apply to me and my life. my advise is to introduce yourself to professors and ask genuine questions you think they could teach you about which will benefit you, your knowledge and future.",
            "make the library your second home. take advantage of the shows and performances, and make new friends!",
            "the professors are extremely qualified. the campus is beautiful and creates community. i have grown mentally, spiritually and physically since my time at ecu."

I have LOVED ECU since stepping on campus in August of 2008, and have made and met unforgettable friendships that will definitely last a lifetime. The atmosphere is amazing, the town locals are VERY kind, and the attitude of success here at East Carolina is alive, as each and every student knows just what it means to study hard, and excel in the classroom!, 708065=There are many traditions at ECU. Firstly, we are the pirates, and what do pirates say? ARGH! If someone yells PURPLE!, you yell GOLD! (our school colors). A football tradition that started in 2008 is the raising of the No Quarter flag during the fourth quarter of a football game. Real pirates would raise a no quarter flag to show the other ship that they will take no prisoners and give no quarter (or mercy). That is exactly what the ECU pirates do in the fourth quarter, give no mercy. Fans in the stands participate by holding up their arms in the air crossed, like a skull and cross bones. There is also one strange tradition that I know of. People will tell you that walking under the cupola in the mall (a small dome/gazebo looking thing in a grass field in central campus) will cause you to not graduate on time. I do not know if this is true or not, but I would not try it in any case., 888819=Take the COAD 1000 class. Learn to manage your time wisely. Do not over fill your daily schedule. Take at least two hours a day to do homework. Have as much fun as possible because senior year comes fast!, 672359=Most of the dorms are really nice. The one dorm that hasn't been renovated recently is being torn down and rebuilt December 2013! They are a great place to be and a great place to make some of the best friends you will ever have!, 748708=ECU offers the perfect student life on campus. While I am not an on campus student, I am an online student, I have toured ECU and my step daughter will be attending ECU and living on campus in the Fall of 2013. We love ECU and are determined to reach our educational goals., 723254=Great college! Really nice professors there. Great orientation session and looking forward to starting in late August., 219494=It depends on what you are studying but so far my classes have been challenging yet not too challenging. Communications 1001 is easy if you show up to class and study for tests. Make sure you study., 939730=The dorm life is not the best but not the worst either. It depends on where you want to live. West End is probably the most convenient to everything. Central Campus is closest to classes. College Hill is closest to the stadium, so if you are planning on being in the band or color guard, that would be the best place for you. They are building a new dorm on the hill that will open fall of 2015., 827931=There are so many chants and cheers. It is not unusual to hear a person yell Purple! from one side of campus, only to be greeted with a Gold! from the other side. There is the annual Polar Plunge every year, where people jump into the outdoor pool (which is frigid to say the least) in the middle of January. Insane but so much fun! Also, we have a cupola in the middle of central campus. No student walks underneath the cupola, because if you do so, it's said that you won't graduate. Keep that in mind! ;), 158953=I have made many great friends through the different things I have been involved with. I have loved the atmosphere and don't want to leave in May., 961103=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 456223=Make sure you look up your professors on ratemyprofessor.com! Try not to have 8:00 AM classes if possible!! Make sure to always carry an umbrella!, 913602=The Polar Bear Plunge is a tradition that takes place in January. Cubes of ice are then poured into the outdoor pool. People gather in groups to jump into the freezing water. At the conclusion, students are given a towel and a t-shirt. The indoor pool is opened, and the canoes and boogie boards are brought out. There is also food and cake provided for everyone.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Brandon from Greenville, NC 12/13/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 22 out of 23 people found this review useful. 3 of 218 Categories Comments Great for these types of students This school is great for students who are very interested in the medical fields, and its school of nursing. Those who are wishing to be Dentists in their career, there is a solid school of dentistry starting in the near future. Yes I am a Geography Major, which has a very succesful graduation rate for their majors, but East Carolina has a broad selection of degrees to ensure that you will be successful in your future career. East Carolina believes in Service, and that is what should be the total decisive factor in coming to an institution such as ECU. Tips for prospective students My tips for prospective students are simple. First tip, come to school knowing you want to succeed and have a great education. You have to come here and study hard, and live a stress free lifestyle. Yes, school can be VERY stressful at times, but remember; only you are in control",
