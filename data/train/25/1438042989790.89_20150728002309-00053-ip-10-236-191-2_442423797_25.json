            "BEARING DEVICE AND HYDRAULIC MACHINE - A bearing device of embodiment is usable for a hydraulic machine having a rotary shaft of a vertical shaft, with a water tank storing lubrication water, and a bearing pad supporting a skirt member on the rotary shaft in the lubrication water. The bearing device has a first supporting mechanism slidably supporting the bearing pad from the radial direction, and a second supporting mechanism slidably supporting the bearing pad from a bottom portion side in an axial direction. One of a supporting surface supporting the bearing pad in the first supporting mechanism and a supported surface supported by the supporting surface in the bearing pad is formed in a convex shape. One of a supporting surface supporting the bearing pad in the second supporting mechanism and a supported surface supported by the supporting surface in the bearing pad is formed in a convex shape.",

To each of a plurality of speech part units of the speech information, an attribute of \u201cinterrupt possible after reproduction\u201d with which reproduction of priority interrupt information can be started after the speech part unit of the speech information is reproduced or another attribute of \u201cinterrupt impossible after reproduction\u201d with which reproduction of the priority interrupt information cannot be started even after the speech part unit of the speech information is reproduced is set. When the priority interrupt information having a high priority rank than the speech information set being currently reproduced is inputted, if the attribute of the speech information being reproduced at the point in time is \u201cinterrupt impossible after reproduction,\u201d then the priority interrupt information is reproduced after the speech information is reproduced. 20110288870 03-17-2011 OCCUPANT RESTRAINING APPARATUS FOR A MOTORCYCLE - An occupant restraining apparatus for a motorcycle which can release an occupant smoothly from a motorcycle body upon falling down. An occupant's seat includes a releasing mechanism which allows release thereof from a seat support member together with an occupant upon falling down of the motorcycle. When the motorcycle falls down, the occupant's seat can be released smoothly from the seat support member. Accordingly, an occupant restraining apparatus for a motorcycle which allows, upon",
