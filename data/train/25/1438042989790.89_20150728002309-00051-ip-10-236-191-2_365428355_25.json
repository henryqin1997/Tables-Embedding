The server is configured to use parameters from the DHCP pool called dhcp-pool. This pool provides clients with the IPv6 address of a DNS server and the domain name to be used. It also specifies that prefixes can be delegated from the prefix pool called client-prefix-pool1. The prefixes delegated will have valid and preferred lifetimes of 1800 and 600 seconds respectively. The prefix pool named client-prefix-pool1 has a prefix of length /40 from which it will delegate (sub) prefixes of length /48., 33680=Router(config-dhcp)# prefix-delegation pool pool1 lifetime 1800 60}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Related Documents Additional References If received RA messages have the \"other configuration\" flag set, the interface will attempt to acquire the other (for example, nonaddress) configuration from any DHCPv6 servers. Addresses are autoconfigured on the interface, based on prefixes in RA messages received from the server. The client has no obvious DHCPv6 configuration. However, the ipv6 address autoconfig command on the uplink to the service provider (GigabitEthernet 0/0/0) causes the following two events: ipv6 dhcp server dhcp-pool ipv6 nd other-config-flag ipv6 address 2001:DB8:1234:42::1/64 description Access link down to customers interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 ! domain-name example.com dns-server 2001:DB8:3000:3000::42 dns-server 2001:DB8:A:B::1 ipv6 dhcp pool dhcp-pool   The following example shows how to use the DHCPv6 function to configure clients with information about the name lookup system. The server is configured with a DHCP pool, which contains the name lookup information that is to be passed to clients. It does not need to contain a prefix pool. This DHCP pool is attached to the access link to customers (GigabitEthernet0/0/0) using the ipv6 dhcp server command. The access link also has the ipv6 nd other-config-flag command enabled.
