The modified information collection requirements in paragraphs 164, 166, 167, 169, 173, 174, 179, 180, and 181 of this document are not applicable until approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Federal Communications Commission will publish a separate document in the Federal Register announcing such approval and the relevant effective date(s). 47 CFR Parts 1, 8, and 20 Summary In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) establishes rules to protect and promote the open Internet. Specifically, the Open Internet Order adopts bright-line rules that prohibit blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization; a rule preventing broadband providers from unreasonably interfering or disadvantaging consumers or edge providers from reaching one another on the Internet; and provides for enhanced transparency into network management practices, network performance, and commercial terms of broadband Internet access service. These rules apply to both fixed and mobile broadband Internet access services. The Order reclassifies broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service subject to Title II of the Communications Act. Finally, the Order forbears from the majority of Title II provisions, leaving in place a framework that will support regulatory action while simultaneously encouraging broadband investment, innovation, and deployment. 2015-03-04; vol.",
