Fast qualifier, Dane Long, started ninth on the inside of the fifth row. At the drop of the green, Thorburn outran McDonough back to the stripe to lead the first lap. Dave Bollis made his run on the outside from the fourth position, with Thorburn able to hold him off with great side-by-side racing until lap five. Lap 10 saw Ed Newman Jr. grab the second position, while a lengthy caution on lap 11 claimed some of the front-runners in the division. Marc Smith and Mike Ammerman climbed into the top five on lap 15, with Smith sitting in second. Meanwhile, Bollis had pulled away from the field, when a caution came out to close the gap. Smith made a last lap run at Bollis, with Bollis taking the checker. Smith, Ammerman, Long, and Thorburn rounded out the top five. Jamie Feguer, Bollis, and Smith tallied heat wins. The Q106 Pony Stocks saw fast qualifier, Trei Deubel, buried deep in the pack for the start of their 20-lap feature. The drop of the green triggered a stampede to lead the first lap. Ponies were three-wide down the backstretch, with Bryan Passick II shown as the lap one leader. Deubel charged from the rear of the field and to lead by lap four. Deubel ran away and hid, leaving the rest of the field to fight for position. Russel Potter, Julie Daley, and Mike Putnam had a great three-way battle going for second by lap 15, with Passick sitting in fifth. At the line, it was Deubel, Potter, Daley, Putnam, and George Wyers. Heats wins went to TJ Conroy and Julie Daley. The 40-lap feature for the Andrews Chevrolet Super Late Models, had Jeff Finley come home the winner, after a spin into the wall two weeks ago spoiled his trip to victory lane. Fast qualifier, Jon McNett, started inside the fourth row and on the start, it was Bill Heeney Jr. to the point. Heeney broke away from the field, with Finley going to work on Lee Taylor and John Ledwidge in his charge to the front. By lap 10, Finley got around Ledwidge for second and set his sights on Heeney Jr. Dave Stehouwer went to work on Taylor from the high side and executed the pass on lap 18, while Finley caught and challenged Heeney Jr. for the lead. After 12 laps of battling side-by-side, Finley made the pass on Heeney Jr. stick on lap 25, while Stehouwer looked for a way around Ledwidge. Finley pulled away from the field and never looked back. At the drop of the checkered flag, it was Finley, Heeney Jr., Ledwidge, Stehouwer, and Taylor. Evan Barrett and Stan Perry were heat winners. The MI Army National Guard MI Modifieds turned out in full-force, as 21 mods timed in for a spot in the 35-lap feature. Bud Perry set fast time, and was rewarded with a twelfth starting position. Rick Gokee Jr. and Bill Butler made up the front row, with Gokee Jr. leading the first lap. Dick Maurer issued a challenge for the lead by lap three and grabbed the position on lap six. Lap seven brought an extended red-flag period, as Rolly Olney struck the wall head-on in turn one. Our thoughts and get-well wishes go out to him. Brian Heeney and Earl Miles made their way around Bill Butler on lap 10. Heeney went to work on Gokee Jr. on lap 15 to advance to second. Miles followed suit and went to work on Heeney\u2019s back bumper for second. Jason Parish jumped into the mix on lap 20, and marched up through the leaders to sit in the second position by lap 30. Maurer had opened up a huge lead when caution came out and closed up the field setting up a three-lap shoot-out to the finish between Maurer, Parish, and Heeney. At the line, it was Maurer, Parish, Heeney, Miles, and Justin Kazmar. Tom Williams, Maurer, and Perry Davenport scored heat wins.}",
