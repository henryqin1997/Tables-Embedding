            "Description",
            "SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE - The operation stability of a SiP (semiconductor device) using a stacked packaging method for stacking a microcomputer IC chip over a driver IC chip is improved. In the SiP using the stacked packaging method for stacking the microcomputer IC chip over the driver IC chip, circuits sensitive to heat or noise, such as an analog to digital conversion circuit, a digital to analog conversion circuit, a sense amplifier circuit of a memory (RAM or ROM), and a power supply circuit of a microcomputer IC chip are prevented from two-dimensionally overlapping with a driver circuit of the lower-side driver IC chip. Since this can reduce, during the operation, the effect of heat or noise, which the circuits sensitive to heat or noise of the microcomputer IC chip receive from the driver circuit of the lower-side driver IC chip, the operation stability of the SiP (semiconductor device) using the stacked packaging method can be improved.",

There is another need for providing a technology capable of reducing a chip size of a semiconductor device. A semiconductor chip includes a power transistor formation region to form a power transistor, a logic circuit formation region to form a logic circuit, and an analog circuit formation region to form an analog circuit. A pad is formed in the power transistor formation region. The pad and a lead are connected through a clip whose cross section is larger than that of a wire. On the other hand, a bonding pad is connected through the wire",
