There are multiple talent shows hosted each year by the Campus Activities Board. Get dressed up and go with your friends. It is amazing the talent on campus. Everyone on campus goes to the Basketball games, and it is so worth it. When football begins in the Fall 2013, that will be the place to be. Different organizations host events throughout the year, such as BlitzWeek. This is a week long effort to raise money full of some crazy and exciting events such as muggle quidditch, a man pageant, and faculty versus varsity basketball game. There is always something to do for fun on campus., 175413=Students coming in to OBU should try to do as much as they can freshman year in regards to activities and getting tons of chapel credits.

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students The OBU student body is very diverse and welcoming to any and all types of people. If you look around you will probably see people hanging out together that look like they normally wouldn't hang out together, which is great! One of the best things about OBU is the strong christian environment. If you are looking for a place to grow your faith and to deepen your walk with the Lord this a great place to do it! All the professors are christians and there are many things to get involved in that are faith and mission based. From the staff to the campus to the students, OBU is just an all around great place to be. Tips for prospective students If you're thinking about coming to OBU, my main advice would be to come on a preview day or a campus visit. When I visited the campus I knew this was the place for me. Being there and picturing myself in my everyday life on the campus really made me feel at home. It is a gorgeous campus and everyone around is so friendly. Bang for the buck Since OBU is a private school, it is no surprise that tuition is on the higher side. I would say,",
