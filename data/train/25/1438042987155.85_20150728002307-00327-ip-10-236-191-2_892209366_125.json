            "Great place, if you lik the outdoors. Enroll here, but understand that there will be construction everywhere.",
            "NAU has an exciting location, but seems to care more about their cash flow and interesting new prospective students rather than keeping their cost down. There is constant construction on the Campus, but Flagstaff overall is wonderful."

I didn't use mine and ended up with an extra $40ish at the end of the year. Go to 1899 Bar and Grill (great food!) and Dolce (in the Union by Denny's and Chick-fil-a). Though it sounds dumb, go to the homecoming parade in downtown because it's cute and is fun to be school spirit-y., 1060817=Secretary of Lambda Pi Eta Omega Delta Chapter 2013-2014, 608187=1899 Bar and Grill is the only 5 star restaurant in Northern Arizona and is located on campus. You can get a great meal there and use your dining dollars to pay., 658652=I've heard nothing but great things about NAU greek life. In August i plan on rushing a sorority. Many of my friends are in Greek life and say its a way to have fun, stay in school, and make long lasting friendships., 242608=The dorms at the moment are a little over crowded because the freshman class was so big, but their in the process of adding two more dorms that will be done for fall 2014 semester. All the freshman dorms have activities or competitions that are held against floors or wings of the building and its a lot of fun., 4626=heard the student to teacher ratio is 17:1. Pretty good compared to other colleges. People I know who go there say the teachers will know you by your name, not just another number in the class., 625458=If you are looking for a more personal college experience, NAU is for you. With a 17:1 faculty to student ratio, you will not just be a number in a crowd. Professors will know you by your first name and you'll make more meaningful connections to the people around you., 151313=Blue Light System. Response time 1:30. Absolutely safe., 779736=Be ready for the snow. It will sneak up on you in October and really hi in December., 276070=The food is pretty good, but after a year you will not want to eat the same stuff anymore. Watch out for the Mexican style places since they are known for food poisoning every now and then. Be sure to go to 1899 with your dining dollars, totally worth spending them!, 814425=ACADEMIC ORGANIZATIONS ACEFNS (Ambassadors for the College of Engineering, Forestry & Natural Sciences) Achieving Sustainable Communities Aerospace Club American Choral Directors Association (ACDA) American Marketing Association American Society of Civil Engineers American Society of Interior Designers American Society of Mechanical Engineers Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Association of Student School Counselors Chi Alpha Epsilon Beta Sigma Chapter Chi Sigma Iota Beta Alpha Chapter Club Managers Association of America Connecting Higher Ed Indigenously Criminal Justice Honor Society Delta Sigma Pi Engineers Without Borders (NAU) Exercise Science Club Eyes of Northern Arizona Pre-Optometry Club Forensic Science Club Forestry Graduate Student Association Future Language Teachers of Northern Arizona (FLTNAz) Future Native American Educators (FNAE) Geology Graduate Student Organization (GGSO) Graduate Association of Political Science Graduate Association of Applied Linguistics Hospitality Entrepreneurs Hospitality Sales and Marketing Association International IEEE Student Chapter International Tuba Euphonium Association Kappa Delta Pi Lambda Pi Eta Le Cercle Francais NAMA \u00e2??

If you like hiking, camping, mountaineering, climbing, etc, then NAU is your place hands down! Nursing students -- NAU has a great program. Those who want smaller classes. Those who want to live on campus. Environmentalists - NAU wants to be carbon neutral by 2020 and any new buildings that have been built within the past 5 years and any future building will be LEED certified. Laid-back people., 915683=Make sure that you bring enough winter clothes or remember to bring them up; the winter season of December through mid-spring can be pretty chilly with the wind whipping off of Humphrey's Peak. Snow boots and long coats are a definite must for the cold season. A bicycle is also highly recommended. NAU is a very green/environmental campus that is bike-friendly with lots of racks and options of renting out bikes available. Join lots of clubs or inter-mural sports! Go to the events that your hall hosts and keep your door open and get to know your hallmates. Everyone at NAU is really friendly and you're all just trying to find some new people to get to know. The clubs, sports, and events will help you meet people not only in your dorm but on campus as well.}",
