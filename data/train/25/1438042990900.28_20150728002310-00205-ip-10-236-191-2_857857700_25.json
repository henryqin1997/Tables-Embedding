            "Two lersivirine 250 milligram (mg) tablets (equivalent to lersivirine 500 mg), a placebo tablet matched to lersivirine and a placebo tablet matched to efavirenz orally once daily along with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) 300 mg tablet and emtricitabine 200 mg tablet orally once daily, in the evening up to 96 weeks. Participants enrolled in pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy switched to lersivirine morning dosing regimen, received 2 Lersivirine 250 mg tablets, a placebo tablet matched to lersivirine orally once daily in the morning for 7 days prior to Week 4, and in the morning and evening on 1 day following Week 4. A placebo tablet matched to efavirenz, tenofovir DF 300 mg tablet and emtricitabine 200 mg tablet were continued in the evening in PK substudy. Evening dosing was continued for the remainder of the study up to Week 96.",
