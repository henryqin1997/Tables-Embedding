            "Great for education majors. UNC started as a teachers school so our education program is awesome. Our nursing school is great as well, one of the most accredited in the country. Our business school is great, as well as our musical theater department.",
            "If you're looking for a big ivy league type school where everyone is extremely studious and serious all the time, UNC is not for you. Not that it's a joke school, but everyone is very laid back and knows how to have a good time.",
            "UNC is one of the less expensive schools in Colorado, but I feel as though they charge fees that aren't necessary.",
            "I LOVE the school and campus. The campus is beautiful, the buildings are nice. There's easy access to many resources including books, internet, and mentors from every job possible. I'm not a fan of the town of Greeley itself... it'd be nice to have more activities for college students. Most of us leave on the weekends to get away, but for education purposes, it's good.",
            "I really feel as though my education has taken off through UNC. I've been learning a lot and I enjoy most of my classes. I do feel though that some classes are pointless when it comes to my major, I don't understand why I have to take these classes because they don't pertain to what I need for my future job, but I guess you never know what knowledge could be useful!"

Grades as well as extracurricular activities will get you into UNC. Stay out of trouble as well, enjoy your senior year of high school, but do not get into trouble because you do not want to miss out on a great college experience especially at UNC. The last thing to let you know is apply for financial aid. Get as much as you possibly can even if they are loans. Do not let money keep you from attending UNC. If you have financial aid questions the UNC Financial Aid office will help you. UNC Also gives out grants and scholarships to incoming freshmen. They have a Universal scholarship application that you can fill out in January once you create an Ursa account. Again to get those scholarships and grants you need the grades and extracurricular activities. YOU REALLY NEED TO FILL OUT A FASFA FORM AS WELL!!!, 484780=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students My tips for prospective students would be to prepare ahead of time for what may come, and to visit the campus, as they may be able to feel the community vibe that UNC carries. Bang for the buck One of my primary reasons for attending UNC in the first place stems from all that I had heard about the Performance Arts program here. UNC may not be the best acting school in the country (if you're looking for that, I'd suggest an observatory), but considering the price, I do believe that it presents one of the best values in the country for this",
