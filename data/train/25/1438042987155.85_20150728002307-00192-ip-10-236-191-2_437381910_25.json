Additional routes for such vehicles have been designated under State authority., 1612=The following data item descriptions should be used with HPMS universe and sample archive data files for years 1993 through 1998. These data item descriptions include the coding instructions and definitions originally used to create the files; item descriptions follow the same sequence as the comma delimited ASCII universe and sample files. Note: all included text and software references are not applicable., 2463=This item is to be coded for all section records. Beginning with 1995 submittal, all data submitted to FHWA must be in metric units. The HPMS software will automatically convert all data to metric during the FHWA submit process. Enter the code to indicate the units of measurement used to report applicable measurement type data items. All applicable data items must use the same reporting unit for the entire data file. There can be no mixing of units within the file., 20923=The complete adjusted urbanized area, including portions that cross State boundaries, is used to establish population criteria for coding this data item. The estimated population between censuses should be used to determine the urbanized area size code (\"3\" or \"4\"). July 1 estimates are available by the end of each calendar year and are on the Internet at www.census.gov., 195875=5 Highways designated as part of the Interstate System under provisions of Section 1105(e) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (105 Statute 2033) as amended under Section 332 of the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (109 Statute 597 and 598). The highways in this category that are open to traffic (code \"05\") must be functionally classified as Interstate. Those coded as \"06\" are to retain the original non-Interstate classification on the current open-to-traffic roadway until they have been officially designated as complete and open-to- traffic Interstate. Alternatively, \"06\" sections may be reported separately as unbuilt (Item 15 = \"2\") and contain the Interstate functional system code in Item 12., 27611=Definitions of the highway functional systems can be found in \"Highway Functional Classification, Concepts, Criteria and Procedures,\" FHWA, March 1989., 157318=The rural and urban peak capacity values are calculated by procedures in the HPMS software provided to the States. The procedures used in the software for determining highway capacity conform to the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Third Edition, updated 1994. The capacity calculations are based on service flow rates for level of service E. The procedures are outlined in Appendix I., 166424=Enter the forecasted AADT for both directions for the appropriate year entered in Year of Future AADT (Item 74). This cannot be for less than 17 years nor for more than 22 years. The intent is to obtain a 20-year forecast, but it may be for some other period of time that is within the noted time span. For example, the future AADT may be for any of the years 2014 to 2019 for the 1997 data year to be reported in 1998. This item may be updated anytime, but must be updated when the forecast falls below the 17-year limit., 107561=Enter the year when a surface improvement (e.g., resurfacing or reconstruction, including new samples selected on newly constructed or improved roadway facilities) has been completed on the section; e.g., 1996 would be coded \"1996\". Do not remove this entry in subsequent data years; it should be retained in the HPMS data record until another improvement affecting the surface is completed on the section. Code \"0000\" if the section has not been improved since the initial reporting year (1988)., 5922=Enter the last two digits of the calendar year for which the data apply. For example, the 1997 data reported in 1998 would be coded \"97\". The data for the year 2000 would be coded \"00\". The HPMS software is \"year 2000\" compliant., 27268=Prior to the 1997 data year, codes 13 and 15 were used to identify connecting link portions of the urban Other Freeways and Expressways and Other Principal Arterial functional systems. Code \"13\" must now be coded as \"12\" and code \"15\" must now be coded as \"14\"., 167603=Enter the last two digits of the year for which Future AADT (Item 73) has been forecasted. This cannot be for less than 17 years nor more than 22 years from the data year. For example, a 21-year forecast reported for the 1997 data year would be coded \"18\" (for the year 2018).}",

It may contain anything the State wishes for identification or for any other purpose. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Headquarters does not use these data. Item 2 -- Metric (or English) Reporting Units (Length = 1) This item is to be coded for all section records. Beginning with 1995 submittal, all data submitted to FHWA must be in metric units.
