Students who are first in their family to graduate from any school. Single parents or parents trying to go back to school. Students straight out of highschool who still haven't figured out what they want to do. Tips for prospective students I recommend joining a club or organization to get involved in the campus. It's a small school so not many people get involved, but when they do it's always fun. I also recommend applying for financial aid as soon as possible and sign up for classes as soon as you're able to. Even though it's a community college, graduating from there is quite heart felt. It's close to home and everyone is kind of in the same boat as you are. Bang for the buck Bookstore books are always overpriced! Online prices like Amazon.com or eBay or Chegg are way more inexpensive! However, the prices per unit aren't that bad, and the library only charges .10",
