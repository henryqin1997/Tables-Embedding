Its 2013 acquisition by the LVMH Group (Louis Vuitton, Mo\u00ebt, Hennessy) gave it an added splash of glamour, and it\u2019s now the third Maison in the Cheval Blanc collection. Anchored on gorgeous Flamands Beach, it is sexy and elegant and exudes the island\u2019s signature ambience of casual sophistication. The brilliantly whitewashed main building, set just above the beach, houses nine rooms and three suites. It is here we see that iconic and frequently photographed breezeway framing an amazing snapshot of the azure sea. It\u2019s breathtaking. We recommend the second floor accommodations for those who would rather see than be seen, but if you prefer the latter, the ground level will put you and your chaise lounge in the midst of all the action: the shimmering pool, the White Bar and the beachside restaurant, La Case de l\u2019Isle \u2013 and all those beautiful people clinking glasses under beach umbrellas. It\u2019s all so St. Barth. A tiny chic boutique offers teeny-tiny bikinis, pareos and movie star-worthy sunglasses. As you would expect, the appointments are luxurious \u2013 4-poster beds, lovely linens, French fabrics and fine art. The marble baths are sumptuous and sensuous. The hotel\u2019s sparkling jewels are four lavishly large Beach Suites, and the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the pair of exquisite (3 bedroom) villas \u2013 the Flamands Villas. Both the Suites and Villas are just steps \u2013 across that sugar-sand beach \u2013 from the sea and boast a panorama of Flamand\u2019s brilliant blue waters. Some of the accommodations include being looked after by a Majordome, Cheval\u2019s dedicated butler. \u201cAcross the way\u201d \u2013 the hotel is divided by a sliver of a road that turns into a cul-de-sac \u2013 there are loads of room and suite options, including bungalow-style villas. Nestled among the bougainvillea and banana plants, they are deliciously private, and several have their own pools. A Cheval Blanc Spa is nestled in the lush gardens and their gym is outfitted with the latest Technogym equipment.}",
