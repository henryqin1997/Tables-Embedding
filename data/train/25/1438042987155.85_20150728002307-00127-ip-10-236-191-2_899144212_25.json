Only one dorm has a/c(Butler) but after October you won't need a/c. Two dorms are close to Nassau Street and have the beautiful gothic architecture. One dorm used to be a hotel and has a strong community.}",

It is a very demanding environment, but if you stay organized it doesn't have to be overly stressful. Other than that, the beauty of Princeton is that it's great for all types of students. The diversity of interests and backgrounds make Princeton the dynamic place that it is. If you are the kind of student that is very concerned about GPA, you should be warned about the grade deflation",
