Going to investigate an upstream patch to allow mutli-line strings to be dumped using the literal style shown here http://michael.f1337.us/2010/03/30/482836205/ - which Symfony's YAML parser already understands.}",

[ View ] I started work on this at the DrupalConMunich sprint. Not sure that this is a complete novice task as the install is a bit tricky since we can't use update_variables_to_config() as the user mail variable may or may not exist it the variable table.
