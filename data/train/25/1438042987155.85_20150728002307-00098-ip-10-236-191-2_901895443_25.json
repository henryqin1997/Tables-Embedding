It truly is in the eye of the beholder, however, if you plan to be a traditional student at Norwich I do not recommend you attend because you will not get the full benefits that the University offers its Cadets.",

Through my eyes being the best military college it is worth every penny. Especially considering if you apply before Nov. 15 you will get a good sum of money in institutional scholarships. Plus if you are seeking a commission like me, they (your captain in the ROTC), will fight for a full 3 to 3.5 year scholarship for you so long as you do well academically and act like you want to be there., 11380=The University is re-modeling all Corp buildings. By the Fall 2012, 4/8 buildings will be completely remodeled and look incredible. South, the new civilian building is the base of the remodels., 150142=For Graduate programs, their is approximately 1 research paper due every 3 weeks that is about 2000 words long or roughly 8-12 pages including title page and bibliography.}",

New theories and rules keep coming as I go on in my classwork. I'm learning a lot, and sometimes it is stressful, but so interesting and exciting at the same time.
