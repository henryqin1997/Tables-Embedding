            "Description",
            "Vehicular air conditioner - An air conditioner for a vehicle includes a blower for generating a flow of air, a center defroster air-blowing outlet disposed adjacent to a windshield of the vehicle for blowing the air toward the windshield, a side defroster air-blowing outlet disposed adjacent to a side window glass of the vehicle for blowing the air toward the side window glass, and a defroster air volume adjusting unit disposed to adjust the volume of air blown from a center defroster air-blowing outlet and the volume of air blown from a side defroster air-blowing outlet.",
            "Air-conditioning device for vehicle - An air-conditioning device for a vehicle includes a blower and an estimating portion. The blower is disposed in an air-conditioning case, and performs a dry control for a heat exchanger arranged in a passenger compartment of the vehicle by sending air. The blower uses one of power supplied from an external power source, power supplied from the battery having residual quantity equal to or larger than a predetermined quantity, or power supplied from an in-vehicle solar cell, while the vehicle is parked. The estimating portion estimates an approximate elimination of odor generated from the heat exchanger by starting the sending of air, and stops the blower based on the estimation.",
            "Air conditioner - An air conditioner includes a cooling heat exchanger configured to cool air, and a wet-state detection sensor attached to an air outlet surface of the cooling heat exchanger to detect a wet state of the air outlet surface due to condensation water. The air outlet surface of the cooling heat exchanger is tilted by an angle with respect to a horizontal direction or is perpendicular to the horizontal direction, and the wet-state detection sensor is arranged at a position in an upper half area of the air outlet surface in a direction perpendicular to the horizontal direction. Alternatively, the wet-state detection sensor is arranged at a position of the air outlet surface in a high-temperature area in which the temperature is higher than an average temperature of the air outlet surface. In this case, the high-temperature area may be positioned within the upper half area of the air outlet surface.",
            "VEHICLE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM PROVIDED WITH SEAT AIR-CONDITIONING UNIT - An air-conditioning system comprising a vehicle air-conditioner which uses a target blowing-out temperature as the basis to control an air outlet temperature in a cabin and a seat air-conditioning unit which sucks recirculated air into a seat and controls at least the seat air-conditioning air flow per unit time so as to perform seat air-conditioning, wherein the air-conditioning system increases the seat air-conditioning air flow when detecting that the vehicle speed is a predetermined value or less, calculates a correction amount for the target blowing-out temperature considered neutral in warmness sense level for the increased seat air-conditioning air flow, and uses the correction amount as the basis to correct the target blowing-out temperature."
