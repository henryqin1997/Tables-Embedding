Many customers use private address spaces, as defined in RFC 1918, and do not want to invest the time and expense of converting to public IP addresses to enable intranet connectivity. MPLS VPNs allow customers to continue to use their present address spaces without network address translation (NAT) by providing a public and private view of the address. A NAT is required only if two VPNs with overlapping address spaces want to communicate. This enables customers to use their own unregistered private addresses, and communicate freely across a public IP network., 215677=Device(config-router-af)# redistribute bgp 10 metric 10000 100 255 1 1500, 11484=BGP propagates reachability information for VPN-IPv4 prefixes among PE devices by means of the BGP multiprotocol extensions (refer to RFC 2283, Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4), which define support for address families other than IPv4. Using the extensions ensures that the routes for a given VPN are learned only by other members of that VPN, enabling members of the VPN to communicate with each other., 259883=RFC 2547, 259613=RFC 2283, 78185=Device(config-vrf)# route-target import 100:1}",
