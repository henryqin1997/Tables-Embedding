After the three-days of on-track action with over 160 competitors giving their all, Saurer raced his way to the top of the heap and collected the $10,000 pay check for winning the Baehman Law B-Mod Nationals main event at MISSISSIPPI THUNDER SPEEDWAY!! The road leading to the unprecedented $10,000 payday for the B-Modified main event win was not easy; but Saurer put his experience, enthusiasm and lucky rock to work for him, and in the end he was standing next to his #21 on the MISSISSIPPI THUNDER SPEEDWAY Victory Lane and holding the huge event trophy, the oversized $10,000 check and basking in the glow of crowd's cheers and the understanding that he'd just beaten the best of the best from B-Mod divisions in three different sanctioning bodies across 10 different states! As a refresher, the design of the three day program was as follows: the top 14 in passing points from Thursday's and Friday's heat races would transfer to that evening's A-Main feature. The remaining starting positions of each night's A-Main feature were then populated",
