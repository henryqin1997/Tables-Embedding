This has effect only for remote column size from non-Oracle database to Oracle database. If the gateway runs on Windows and HS_LANGUAGE=AL32UTF8, then you must not specify this parameter, as it would influence other ratio related parameter operation. It has no effect for calculating ratio for data moving from Oracle database to non-Oracle database through gateway during INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. HS_KEEP_REMOTE_COLUMN_SIZE specifies whether to suppress ratio expansion when computing the length of (VAR)CHAR datatypes during data conversion from the non-Oracle database to the gateway, and then to the Oracle database. When it is set to REMOTE, the expansion is suppressed between the non-Oracle database and the gateway. When it is set to LOCAL, the expansion is suppressed between the gateway and the Oracle database. When it is set to ALL, the expansion is suppressed from the non-Oracle database to the Oracle database. String Parameter type HS_KEEP_REMOTE_COLUMN_SIZE = OFF | LOCAL |REMOTE | ALL Syntax OFF | LOCAL | REMOTE | ALL Range of Values",
    "textAfterTable": "This parameter is valid only when HS_LANGUAGE is set to AL32UTF8 and the gateway runs on Windows. As more Oracle databases and non-Oracle databases use Unicode as database character sets, it is preferable to also run the gateway in Unicode character set. To do so, you must set HS_LANGUAGE=AL32UTF8. However, when the gateway runs on Windows, the Microsoft ODBC Driver Manager interface can exchange data only in the double-byte character set, UCS2. This results in extra ratio expansion of described buffer and column sizes. To compensate, the gateway can re-adjust the column size if HS_FDS_REMOTE_DB_CHARSET is set to the corresponding non-Oracle database character set. For example, HS_FDS_REMOTE_DB_CHARSET=KO16KSC5601. D.3.27 HS_FDS_SUPPORT_STATISTICS Property Description Default Value TRUE Range of values {TRUE|FALSE} Syntax HS_FDS_SUPPORT_STATISTICS= {TRUE|FALSE} We gather statistics from the non-Oracle database by default.
