            "Great school for people that require a more personalized learning. The classes are small in size (such as those in a high school) which allow for a more individualized learning. Overall, you are not just a dot in the crowd. The teachers also have office hours that you can attend to for extra help. There is a teaching and learning center where you can go for help in writing, reading, science, and math.",
            "You can attend free yoga classes, and there is a REC center that organizes hikes and other recreational events.",
            "There is a cafe and a Subway, and other than that I haven't really explored other options. The Melting Pot and The Rock Wood Fired Pizza are nearby as well.",
            "I live at home and the commute is not too tedious. I use the public transit system which is excellent. You can use the bus and the Sounder Train, however the Sounder is only available in the early morning and in the afternoon. * The dorms have their own kitchen which is a plus and they are pretty compared to the dorms of other schools. The dorm building has its own mini-gym.",
            "So far, I have gotten a ton of readings. One or two each night and around thirty pages long (each). They can be hard to understand but I am glad we have a class discussion about each one.",
            "1. Attend one of the earlier class registration dates as classes fill up quickly. 2. Make sure to have filled out the FAFSA before the priority deadline. 3. Plan your commute beforehand if you will not be staying in the dorms. 4. THERE ARE ONLY CERTAIN DEGREES OFFERED AT THIS SCHOOL. MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CAREER PLANS CAN BE MET BEFORE ENROLLING. I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. I signed up",
            "The teachers are very approachable and helpful. However, the institution is a tad unorganized and makes registration errors/mistakes here and there, which can be very frustrating. These errors can usually be fixed after visiting the school or making a few calls. Other than that, I really like the school and I have only been attending for about two months."

On campus we have Subway, Starbucks, Cutter's Point Coffee, The Old Spaghetti Factory, The Rock, Indochine, Hello Cupcake, Hot Rod Dog, Taco Del Mar, The Harmon, and The Swiss. I have found that nearly every one of these dining area's mentioned gives discounts to UW - Tacoma students. Also, the food is always affordable for a college students budget. There is also Metro Coffee on a campus, which is a great location for students to gather and grab some excellent coffee between classes! (This is more affordable coffee than at Starbucks.) This coffee shop also has a very urban feel to it, which I love. The Dawg House Cafe on campus has a great variety of grab-n-go food which meets the needs of individuals with food allergies and preferences such as; gluten, peanuts, vegan, and vegetarians. The small grocery mart near GWP hall and the Joy Building also has an excellent selection of snacks, meals, etc. for those with food preferences and allergies.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Before applying, I spoke to a few job recruiters independent of the school and asked them if a degree from one of the private universities nearby was of any greater value to them on a resume than the University of Washington. Across the board, they agreed that an education from the UW was just as valuable as a private school, and at a fraction of the price! Am enjoying being here If you want a party school, this is probably not the place for you. If you want a small-school environment with big-school education tools and resources, this is a great place to be. The location is convenient and near many of the attractions Western Washington has to offer. Am learning a lot The teaching staff at the University of Washington - Tacoma has been top-notch for me so far. I have taken classes in Literature, Mathematics, History, and other varying categories and each professor has delivered an interactive curriculum enabling students to learn both in and out of class.
