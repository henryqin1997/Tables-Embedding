Sending packets larger than 1406 bytes could cause potential problems; as a result, there is a size restriction., 631963=Sets the duration for which all addresses are secured; valid values are from 1 to 1440 minutes., 679273=Protect--When the number of port-secure MAC addresses reaches the maximum limit that is allowed on the port, the packets with unknown source addresses are dropped until you remove a sufficient number of secure MAC addresses. Platform port-security disable traps is configurable only when the violation mode is set to protect. When this option is configured, drop entries will not be installed into hardware for violating addresses, thus allowing traffic to continue to flow to violating address from legitimate ports. To protect switch CPU against overload when this option is enabled, we recommend that you configure the port-security rate-limiter to 2000 packets per second with a burst rate of 10., 645672=MAC addresses for the interface; valid values are from 1 to 1024., 377125=This command was introduced on Cisco Aironet Access Point 1100 and Cisco Aironet Access Point 1200., 422748=The following example shows how to change the status of signature 9000:0 to enabled:, 580620=Size of MTU, in bytes.
