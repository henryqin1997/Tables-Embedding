    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6400=[0079] An article was prepared as in Example 7 except that glycerol (same as described in Example 2) was applied to the mating surfaces of 2025 Black and 3194 Yellow samples prior to sandwiching them together. The resultant 5-layer sample (3 layers of acrylic and 2 layers of glycerol) was then clamped together to minimize the thickness of each of the glycerol contact layers. The optical and color properties of the multi-layer samples from Examples 7 and 8 are summarized below in Table VIII.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40140=[0030] Opaque and translucent layers can be formed by any suitable material capable of imparting translucency or opaqueness. In addition to pigmented glasses and plastics, example opaque layers can be one or more layers of paint, foil, metal, paper, cardboard, or combinations thereof. Example translucent layers include many commercially available translucent plastics (Plexiglas\ufffd MC sheet in the following colors: 2157 Red, 2108 Green, 2114 Blue, for example, Plexiglas\ufffd G or MC sheet in W7328 White, Plexiglas\ufffd Frosted sheet products, etc.) or frosted glass., 94858=[0071] The above Plexiglas\ufffd MC 3190 Green and Plexiglas\ufffd MC 2025 Black samples were sandwiched together and then clamped to hold the layers together., 75595=[0062] Monolithic sheet samples of 0.118\u2033 thick, Plexiglas\ufffd MC 2069 Blue and Plexiglas\ufffd MC 2208 Yellow were each melt processed on a sheet extrusion line. These samples are commercially available from ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. (Atoglas Division in North America). Samples of each of the 2 colors were cut to size (about 2\u2033\ufffd2\u2033). The sample edges were subsequently edge finished as described in Example 1., 81481=[0064] The above Plexiglas\ufffd MC 2069 Blue and Plexiglas\ufffd MC 2208 Yellow samples were sandwiched together and then clamped to hold the layers together., 107933=[0078] The above Plexiglas\ufffd MC 3194 Yellow and Plexiglas\ufffd MC 2025 Black samples were sandwiched together and then clamped to hold the layers together., 38030=[0027] In articles of the present invention, one or more of the layers is light transmitting. Light transmitting layers are transparent, allowing, for example, objects or images to be clearly perceived through the layer. Light transmitting layers can have a measurable luminous transmission greater than about 0% and a haze value less than about 30%. Typically colorless light transmitting layers have a luminous transmission greater than about 60%. Other layers can be translucent or opaque. Translucent layers admit and diffuse light such that objects or images usually cannot be clearly perceived through the layer. Translucent layers typically have a measurable luminous transmission greater than about 0% and a haze value of more than about 30%. Opaque layers typically do not allow light to penetrate entirely through, and have a luminous transmission of about 0%. Luminous transmission and haze can be measured by any method known in the art such as according to ASTM D 1003 or techniques described in the Examples., 101606=[0076] Monolithic sheet samples of 0.227\u2033 thick, Plexiglas\ufffd MC 3194 Fluorescent Yellow and 0.169\u2033 thick, Plexiglas\ufffd MC 2025 Black were melt processed on a sheet extrusion line. These samples are commercially available from ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. (Atoglas Division in North America). Samples of each of the 2 colors were cut to size (about 3\u2033\ufffd4\u2033). The sample edges were subsequently edge finished as described in Example 1., 100140=[0073] In Examples 5 and 6, the transmission values are zero due to the presence of the 2025 Black opaque layer in each sample. The glycerol was used in Example 6 to make optical contact between the layers., 25180=[0001] This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Application 60/451,901 filed Mar. 4, 2003., 113237=[0080] In Examples 7 and 8, the transmission values are zero due to the presence of the 2025 Black opaque layers in each sample. The glycerol was used in Example 8 to make optical contact between the acrylic layers., 88965=[0069] Monolithic sheet samples of 0.227\u2033 thick, Plexiglas\ufffd MC 3190 Fluorescent Green and 0.169\u2033 thick Plexiglas\ufffd MC 2025 Black were each melt processed on a sheet extrusion line. These samples are commercially available from ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. (Atoglas Division in North America). Samples of each of the 2 colors were cut to size (about 3\u2033\ufffd3\u2033). The sample edges were subsequently edge finished as described in Example 1.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0127] While the foregoing has described what are considered to be preferred embodiments of the invention it is understood that various modifications may be made therein and that the invention may be implemented in various forms and embodiments, and that it may be applied in numerous applications, only some of which have been described herein. It is intended by the following claims to claim all modifications and variations which fall within the true scope of the invention. [0126] When looking directly through the edge of the Example 21 sample (e.g. \u03b8=0\ufffd), the thin, fluorescent blue surface layer and the thick, transparent blue surface layer are each visible. The edge color of each layer is visibly different from the adjacent layer. However, as the viewing angle is incrementally increased, the edge colors of each of the layers changes to a bluish color at a threshold viewing angle. [0125] The particle-containing feed stream for the above thin layer is the same as the one described in Example 11 except for the colorants. In this Example, the exact same colorant formulation and loading level used to make Plexiglas\ufffd MC 3152 Fluorescent Blue sheet was also blended into the particle-containing resin. [0124] Two-layer sheet samples of 0.210\u2033 total thickness were co-extruded on a sheet extrusion line. The thinner surface layer was fed from the secondary extruder that was processing",
