The main peak at 14.4 min accounted for less than 50% of the total absorbance. A 0.5 mg portion of the crude product was purified to give approximately 0.1 mg of H-Taeg-Aaeg-[Taeg]8-Lys-NH2. For (MH+)* the calculated m/z value was 2816.16 and the measured m/z value was 2816.28., 128446=Sodium carbonate (29.14 g; 0.275 mol) and 4-nitrophenol (12.75 g; 91.6 mmol) were mixed with dioxane (250 ml). Boc-anhydride (20.0 g; 91.6 mmol) was transferred to the mixture with dioxane (50 ml). The mixture was refluxed for 1 h, cooled to 0\ufffd C., filtered and concentrated to \u2153, and then poured into water (350 ml) at 0\ufffd C. After stirring for \ufffd h., the product was collected by filtration, washed with water, and then dried over sicapent, in vacuo. Yield 21.3 g (97%). M.p. 73.0-74.5\ufffd C.

The peptide nucleic acids are prepared from the C terminus towards the N terminus using monomers having protected amino groups. Following completion of the peptide region, the terminal amine blocking group is removed and the resulting amine reacted with a 3\u2032-C-(formyl)-2\u2032, 3\u2032-dideoxy-5\u2032-trityl nucleotide as prepared per the procedure of Vasseur, et. al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 4006. The condensation of the amine with the aldehyde moiety of the C-formyl nucleoside is effected as per the conditions of the Vasseur, ibid., to yield an intermediate imine linkage. The imine linkage is reduced under reductive the alkylation conditions of Vasseur, ibid., with HCHO/NaBH3CN/AcOH to yield the nucleoside connected to the peptide nucleic acid via an methyl alkylated amine linkage. An internal 2\u2032-deoxy phosphorothioate nucleotide region is then continued from this nucleoside as per standard automatated DNA synthetic protocols (see Oligonucleotide synthesis, a practic approach, M. J. Gait ed, IRL Press, 1984)., 208291=About 2.5 g of wet Boc-[Taeg]3-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin (\u02dc\u2159 of the total remaining about 16 g wet resin; \u02dc0.75 g dry resin \u02dc0.15 mmol growing chains) was placed in a 6 ml SPPS reaction vessel. Boc-[Taeg]5-Caeg-[Taeg]4-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin was assembled by double coupling of all Taeg-residues utilizing the usual 2.5 equivalents of BocTaeg-OPfp in 2.5 ml about 30% DMF/CH2Cl2, except that the first residue was single-coupled. Incorporation of the C(Z)aeg-residue was accomplished by coupling with 2.0 equivalents of BocC(Z)aeg-OPfp in TFE/CH2Cl2 (1:2, v/v). The progress of the synthesis was monitored at all stages by the quantitative ninhydrin reaction (see Table III)., 427296=Boc-aminoethylglycine ethyl ester (1.80 g; 7.30 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (10 ml). Dhbt-OH (1.31 g; 8.03 mmol) was added, whereby a precipitate was formed. DMF (2\ufffd10 ml) was added until the precipitate was dissolved. The product of Example 120 (2.00 g; 8.03 mmol) was added slowly to avoid precipitation. Methylene chloride (30 ml) was added, and the mixture was cooled to 0\ufffd C. and then filtered. The precipitate, DCU, was washed twice with methylene chloride. To the combined filtrate was added methylene chloride (100 ml). The mixture was washed with half saturated NaHCO3-solution (3\ufffd100 ml, H2O:saturated NaHCO3-solution 1:1 v/v), then with dilute KHSO4-solution (2\ufffd100 ml, H2O:saturated KHSO4-solution 4:1 v/v), and finally with saturated NaCl-solution (1\ufffd100 ml). The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered, and evaporated to dryness in vacuo (about 15 mmHg and then about 1 mmHg). The residue was suspended in methylene chloride (35 ml), stirred for 45 min at room temperature, and filtered (the precipitate was DCU). Petroleum ether (2 volumes) was added dropwise to the filtrate at 0\ufffd C., whereby an oil precipitated. The liquor was decanted and the remaining oil dissolved in methylene chloride (20-50 ml). Precipitated was effected by the addition of petroleum ether (2 volumes). This procedure was repeated 5 times until an impurity was removed. The impurity can be seen at TLC with 10% MeOH/CH2Cl2 as the developing solvent. The resulting oil was dissolved in methylene chloride (25 ml) and evaporated to dryness in vacuo, which caused solidification of the title compound. Yield: 2.03 g ((58%). Mp. 87\ufffd-90\ufffd C.

Am. Chem. Soc., 1989, 111, 8024 and International Patent Application WO 90/02749) to facilitate the preparation of large numbers of peptides. This matrix is comprised of a polyethylene (PE) film with pendant long-chain polystyrene (PS) grafts (molecular weight on the order of 106). The loading capacity of the film is as high as that of a beaded matrix, but PEPS has the additional flexibility to suit multiple syntheses simultaneously. Thus, in a new configuration for solid-phase peptide synthesis, the PEPS film is fashioned in the form of discrete, labeled sheets, each serving as an individual compartment. During all the identical steps of the synthetic cycles, the sheets are kept together in a single reaction vessel to permit concurrent preparation of a multitude of peptides at a rate close to that of a single peptide by conventional methods. It was reasoned that the PEPS film support, comprising linker or spacer groups adapted to the particular chemistry in question, should be particularly valuable in the synthesis of multiple PNA molecules, these being conceptually simple to synthesize since only four different reaction compartments are normally required, one for each of the four \u201cpseudo-nucleotide\u201d units. Thus, the PEPS film support has been successfully tested in a number of PNA syntheses carried out in a parallel and substantially simultaneous fashion. The yield and quality of the products obtained from PEPS were comparable to those obtained by using the traditional polystyrene beaded support. Also, experiments with other geometries of the PEPS polymer such as, for example, non-woven felt, knitted net, sticks or microwellplates have not indicated any limitations of the synthetic efficacy., 235915=N\u2032-Boc-aminoethyl glycine ethyl ester (5.00 g; 20.3 mmol), DhbtOH (3.64 g; 22.3 mmol) and N4-benzyloxycarbonyl-1-carboxymethyl cytosine (6.77 g; 22.3 mmol) were suspended in DMF (100 ml). Methylene chloride (100 ml) then was added. The solution was cooled to 0\ufffd C. and DCC (5.03 g; 24.4 mmol) was added. The ice bath was removed after 2 h and stirring was continued for another hour at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture then was evaporated to dryness, in vacuo. The residue was suspended in ether (100 ml) and stirred vigorously for 30 min. The solid material was isolated by filtration and the ether wash procedure was repeated twice. The material was then stirred vigorously for 15 min with dilute sodium hydrogencarbonate (aprox. 4% solution, 100 ml), filtered and washed with water. This procedure was then repeated once, which after drying left 17.0 g of yellowish solid material. The solid was then boiled with dioxane (200 ml) and filtered while hot. After cooling, water (200 ml) was added. The precipitated material was isolated by filtration, washed with water, and dried. According to HPLC (observing at 260 nm) this material has a purity higher than 99%, besides the DCU. The ester was then suspended in THF (100 ml), cooled to 0\ufffd C., and 1 N LiOH (61 ml) was added. After stirring for 15 minutes, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was washed with methylene chloride (2\ufffd150 ml). The alkaline solution then was cooled to 0\ufffd C. and the pH was adjusted to 2.0 with 1 N HCl. The title compound was isolated by filtration and was washed once with water, leaving 11.3 g of a white powder after drying. The material was suspended in methylene chloride (300 ml) and petroleum ether (300 ml) was added. Filtration and wash afforded 7.1 g (69%) after drying. HPLC showed a purity of 99% RT=19.5 min, and a minor impurity at 12.6 min (approx. 1%) most likely the Z-de protected monomer. Anal. for C23H29N5O8 found(calc.)

This seems to explain why even at pH 9 a 2:1 complex is seen with the 5\u2032/N-orientation. Furthermore, it explains the small loss in going from pH 7.2 to 9 in the 3\u2032/N, as this is probably a 1:1 complex., 202342=Following deprotection of a portion of Boc-[Taeg]10-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin (estimated dry weight is about 45 mg), the resin was next acetylated quantitatively with a 2 ml mixture of acetic anhydride/pyridine/CH2Cl2 (1:1:2, v/v/v) for 2 h in a 3 ml solid-phase reaction vessel., 142023=To a solution of (N-Boc-2-aminoethyl)glycine (2) in DMF, prepared as described above, was added triethyl amine (7.00 ml; 50.8 mmol) and N4-benzyloxycarbonyl-N1-carboxymethyl-cytosine pentafluorophenyl ester (11, 2.70 g; 5.75 mmol). After stirring the solution for 1 h at room temperature, methylene chloride (150 ml), saturated sodium chloride (250 ml), and 4 N hydrochloric acid to pH \u02dc1 were added. The organic layer was separated and washed twice with saturated sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness, in vacuo, first with a water aspirator and then with an oil pump. The oily residue was treated with water (25 ml) and was again evaporated to dryness, in vacuo. This procedure then was repeated. The oily residue (2.80 g) was then dissolved in methylene chloride (100 ml), petroleum ether (250 ml) was added, and the mixture was stirred overnight. The title compound was isolated by filtration and washed with petroleum ether. Tlc (system 1) indicated substantial quantities of pentafluorophenol, but no attempt was made to remove it. Yield: 1.72 g (59%). M.p. 156\ufffd C.

FAB-MS: 504 (M+1); 448 (M+1-tBu)., 352060=Synthesis was initiated on approximately \ufffd of the wet H-[Taeg]5-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin from Example 86. In situ diisopropyl carbodiimide (DIC) couplings of both Boc-(apgT)-OH and BocTaeg-OH were carried out in 1.2 ml 50% DMF/CH2Cl2 using 119 0.048 g (0.12 mmol) and 0.046 g (0.12 mmol) monomer, respectively, and 18.7 \u03bcl (0.12 mmol) diisopropyl carbodiimide in each coupling. All qualitative Kaiser tests were negative, indicating near 100% coupling yield. The PNA oligomer was cleaved and purified by standard procedures. For (M+H)+, the calculated m/z value was 2820.15 and the measured m/z value was 2820.92., 221016=A portion of protected Boc-[Taeg]5-Caeg-[Taeg]4-Lys(ClZ)-BHA resin was treated as described in Example 27(c) to yield about 14.4 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 66.9 mg dry H-[Taeg]5-Caeg-[Taeg]4-Lys(ClZ)-BHA resin. The main peak at 14.5 min accounted for >50% of the total absorbance. A 100.0 mg portion of the crude product was purified (8 batches; each dissolved in 1 ml H2O) to give approximately 9.1 mg of 96% pure H-[Taeg]5-Caeg-[Taeg]4-Lys-NH2 (FIG. 10b). For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value=2793,8 and the measured m/z value=2790,6., 393285=The protected Boc-C(Z)aeg-[Taeg]2-[C(Z)aeg]3-[Taeg]2-[C(Z)aeg]2-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin was treated as described in Example 27c to yield about 11.7 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 42.0 mg dry H\u2014C(Z)aeg-[Taeg]2-[C(Z)aeg]3-[Taeg]2-[C(Z)aeg]2-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin. Crude product (11.6 mg) was purified to give 3.1 mg of H-Caeg-[Taeg]2-[Caeg]3-[Taeg]2-[Caeg]2-LysNH2. For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value was 2717.15; the m/z value was not measured., 344785=A 375 mg portion of MBHA resin (loading 0.6 mmol/g) was allowed to swell over night in dichloromethane (DCM). After an hour in DMF/DCM, the resin was neutralized by washing 2 times with 5% diisopropylethylamine in DCM (2 min.), followed by washing with DCM (2 ml; 6\ufffd1 min.) N,N\u2032-di-Boc-aminoethyl glycine (41.9 mg; 0.132 mmol) disolved in 2 ml DMF was added to the resin, followed by DCC (64.9 mg; 0.315 mmol) dissolved in 1 ml of DCM. After 2.5 hours, the resin was washed with DMF 3 times (1 min.) and once with DCM (1 min.). The unreacted amino groups were then capped by treatment with acetic anhydride/DCM/pyridine (1 ml\\2 ml\\2 ml) for 72 hours. After washing with DCM (2 ml; 4\ufffd1 min), a Kaiser test showed no amino groups were present. The resin was deprotected and washed as described above. This was followed by reaction with 6-(Bocamino)-hexanoic acid DHBT ester (255.8 mg; 67 mmol) dissolved in DMF/DCM 1:1 (4 ml) overnight. After washing and neutraliation, a Kaiser test and an isatin test were performed. Both were negative. After capping, the elongenation of the PNA-chains was performed according to standard procedures for DCC couplings. All Kaiser tests performed after the coupling reactions were negative (Yellow). Qualitative Kaiser tests were done after deprotection of PNA units number 1, 2, 4, and 6. Each test was blue. The PNA oligomers were cleaved and purified by standard procedures., 338085=The protected Boc-[Taeg]2-A(Z)aeg-Taeg-C(Z)aeg-A(Z)aeg-Taeg-C(Z)aeg-Taeg-C(Z)aeg-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin was treated as described in Example 27c to yield about 53.4 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 166.1 mg dry Boc-[Taeg]2-A(Z)aeg-Taeg-C(Z)aeg-A(Z)aeg-Taeg-C(Z)aeg-Taeg-C(Z)aeg-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin.

After stirring for 10 min, the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 3 with 4 M hydrogen chloride. The solution was subsequently extracted with ethyl acetate (3\ufffd100 ml). The combined organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate. After evaporation, the resulting foam was dissolved in ethyl acetate (400 ml) and a few ml of methanol to dissolve the solid material. Petroleum ether then was added until precipitation started. After standing overnight at \u221220\ufffd C., the precipitate was removed by filtration. This gave 1.01 g (50.5%) of pure compound (>99% by HPLC). The compound can be recrystallized from 2-propanol.

Molecules which block formation will decrease the signal detected with the fos antibody, but not the jun antibody., 174546=A portion of protected Boc-[Taeg]10-BHA resin was treated as described in section (c) to yield 11.0 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 18.9 mg dry H-[Taeg]10-BHA resin. The main peak at 15.5 min accounted for about 53% of the total absorbance. About 1 mg of the crude product was purified repeatedly (for reasons described below) to give approximately 0.1 mg of at least 80% but presumably >99% pure H-[Taeg]10-NH2. A rather broad tail eluting after the target peak and accounting for about 20% of the total absorbance could not be removed (only slightly reduced) upon the repeated purification. Judged by the mass spectrum, which only confirms the presence of the correct molecular weight H-[Taeg]10-NH2, the tail phenomonen is ascribed to more or less well-defined aggregational/conformational states of the target molecule. Therefore, the crude product is likely to contain more than the above-mentioned 53% of the target molecule. H-[Taeg]10-NH2 is readily dissolved in water. For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value was 2679.6 and the measured m/z value was 2681.5., 245165=N\u2032-Boc-aminoethyl glycine ethyl ester (2.00 g; 8.12 mmol), DhbtOH (1.46 g; 8.93 mmol) and N6-benzyloxycarbonyl-9-carboxymethyl adenine (2.92 g; 8.93 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (15 ml). Methylene chloride (15 ml) then was added. The solution was cooled to 0\ufffd C. in an ethanol/ice bath. DCC (2.01 g; 9.74 mmol) was added. The ice bath was removed after 2.5 h and stirring was continued for another 1.5 hour at ambient temperature. The precipitated DCU was removed by filtration and washed once with DMF (15 ml), and twice with methylene chloride (2\ufffd15 ml). To the combined filtrate was added more methylene chloride (100 ml). The solution was washed successively with dilute sodium hydrogen carbonate (2\ufffd100 ml), dilute potassium hydrogen sulfate (2\ufffd100 ml), and saturated sodium chloride (1\ufffd100 ml). The organic phase was evaporated to dryness, in vacuo, which afforded 3.28 g (73%) of a yellowish oily substance. HPLC of the raw product showed a purity of only 66% with several impurities, both more and less polar than the main peak. The oil was dissolved in absolute ethanol (50 ml) and activated carbon was added. After stirring for 5 minutes, the solution was filtered. The filtrate was mixed with water (30 ml) and was left with stirring overnight. The next day, the white precipitate was removed by filtration, washed with water, and dried, affording 1.16 g (26%) of a material with a purity higher than 98% by HPLC. Addition of water to the mother liquor afforded another 0.53 g with a purity of approx. 95%. Anal. for C26H33N7O7\ufffdH2O found(calc.)

The resultant solution was stirred for 1 h. The solution was cooled to 0\ufffd C. and treated with cation exchange material (\u201cDowex 50W X-8\u201d, 40 g) for 20 min. The cation exchange material was removed by filtration, washed with dichloromethane (2\ufffd15 ml), and dichloromethane (150 ml) was added. The resulting solution was washed with saturated sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness, in vacuo, first by a water aspirator and then by an oil pump.

After dissolution of the 1-thyminylacetic acid, methylene chloride (20 ml) was added and the solution cooled on an ice bath. When the reaction mixture had reached 0\ufffd C., DCC (2.88 g, 14.0 mmol) was added. Within 5 min after the addition a precipitate of DCU was seen. After 35 min the ice bath was removed. The reaction mixture was filtered 3.5 h later and the precipitate washed with methylene chloride (200 ml). The resulting solution was extracted twice with 5% sodium hydrogen carbonate (200 ml) and twice with saturated potassium hydrogen sulfate in water (100 ml). After a final extraction with saturated sodium chloride (250 ml), the solution was dried with magnesium sulfate and evaporated to give an oil.

C-jun is a major component of the AP-1 binding site, which was originally shown to regulate tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) induced expression of responsive genes through the TPA response element (TRE). The jun protein forms homo- or heterodimers which bind the TRE. The fos protein is only active as a heterodimer with any of the jun family of proteins.

FAB-MS: 443 (M+1+glycerol), 351 (M+1). 1H-NMR (90 MHz; DMS-d6): 11.52 ppm (s,1H,NH) ; 7.64 (s,1H,ArH); 4.99 (s,2H, CH 2); 1.76 (s,3H,CH 3)., 395447=The protected Boc-[C(Z)aeg]2-[Taeg]2-[C(Z)aeg]3-[Taeg]2-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin was treated as described in Example 27c to yield about 57.6 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 172.7 mg dry H-[C(Z)aeg]2-[Taeg]2-[C(Z)aeg]3-[Taeg]2-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin. Crude product (57.6 mg) was purified to give 26.3 mg of H-[Caeg]2-[Taeg]2-[Caeg]3-[Taeg]2-Lys-NH2. For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value was 2466.04; the m/z value was not measured., 109762=In the above-mentioned \u201cBoc-benzyl\u201d protection scheme, the final deprotection of side-chains and release of the PNA molecule from the solid support is most often carried out by the use of strong acids such as anhydrous HF (Sakakibara, et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1965, 38, 4921), boron tris (trifluoroacetate) (Pless, et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 1973, 46, 1609), and sulfonic acids such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and methanesulfonic acid (Yajima, et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Comm., 1974, 107). This conventional strong acid (e.g., anhydrous HF) deprotection method, produces very reactive carbocations that may lead to alkylation and acylation of sensitive residues in the PNA chain. Such side-reactions are only partly avoided by the presence of scavengers such as anisole, phenol, dimethyl sulfide, and mercaptoethanol and, therefore, the sulfide-assisted acidolytic SN2 deprotection method (Tam, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1983, 105, 6442 and J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1986, 108, 5242), the so-called \u201clow\u201d, which removes the precursors of harmful carbocations to form inert sulfonium salts, is frequently employed in peptide and PNA synthesis, either solely or in combination with \u201chigh\u201d methods. Less frequently, in special cases, other methods used for deprotection and/or final cleavage of the PNA-solid support bond are, for example, such methods as base-catalyzed alcoholysis (Barton, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1973, 95, 4501), and ammonolysis as well as hydrazinolysis (Bodanszky, et al., Chem. Ind., 1964 1423), hydrogenolysis (Jones, Tetrahedron Lett. 1977 2853 and Schlatter, et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1977 2861)), and photolysis (Rich and Gurwara, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1975 97, 1575))., 177782=(1) Boc-deprotection with TFA/CH2Cl2 (1:1, v/v), 3 ml, 3\ufffd1 min and 1\ufffd30 min; (2) washing with CH2Cl2, 3 ml, 6\ufffd1 min; (3) neutralization with DIEA/CH2Cl2 (1:19, v/v), 3 ml, 3\ufffd2 min; (4) washing with CH2Cl2, 3 ml, 6\ufffd1 min, and drain for 1 min; (5) 2-5 mg sample of PNA-resin may be taken out and dried thoroughly for a quantitative ninhydrin analysis to determine the substitution; (6) addition of 3.2 equiv.

Therefore, it is not surprising that the stoichiometry was found to be 2:1., 275266=N-[(1-(N-4-Z) -cytosyl)acetyl]-N\u2032-Boc-aminoethyl-\u03b2-alanine methyl ester (0.621 g; 0.0012 mol) was dissolved in 2 M sodium hydroxide (8.5 ml) and stirred for 2 h. Subsequently, pH was adjusted to 2 at 0\ufffd C. with 4 M hydrochloric acid and the solution stirred for 2 h. The precipitate was isolated by filtration, washed three times with cold water, and dried over sicapent, in vacuo. Yield 0.326 g (54%).

The main peak at 15.8 min accounted for about 75% of the total absorbance. A 4.8 mg portion of the crude product was purified to give approximately 3.5 mg of >95% pure Ac-[Taeg]10-Lys-NH2. For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value=2849.8 and the measured m/z value=2848.8., 261700=The methyl ester of the title compound (1.57 g, 3.81 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (100 ml) and cooled on an ice bath. Sodium hydroxide (100 ml; 2 M) was added. After stirring for 10 min the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 3 with 4 M hydrogen chloride. The solution then was extracted with ethyl acetate (3\ufffd100 ml). The combined organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate. After evaporation, the oil was dissolved in ethyl acetate (200 ml). Petroleum ether was added (to a total volume of 600 ml) until precipitation started. After standing overnight at \u221220\ufffd C., the precipitate was removed by filtration. This afforded 1.02 g (67.3%) of the title compound, which was 94% pure according to HPLC. FAB-MS: 399 (M+1). 1H-NMR: 11.34 (s, 1 H, COOH); 7.42 (s, 1 H, H\u20326); 4.69 (s, 2 H, CH\u20322); 4.40 (q, 1 H, CH in Ala, J=7.20 Hz); 1.83 (s, 3 H, Me in T); 1.52-1.40 (m, 12 H, Boc+Me in Ala)., 138900=In a three necked round bottomed flask equipped with mechanical stirring and nitrogen coverage was placed methyl bromacetate (7.82 ml;82.6 mmol) and a suspension of N4-benzyloxycarbonyl-cytosine (9, 21.0 g; 82.6 mmol) and potassium carbonate (11.4 g; 82.6 mmol) in dry DMF (900 ml). The mixture was stirred vigorously overnight, filtered, and evaporated to dryness, in vacuo. Water (300 ml) and 4 N hydrochloric acid (10 ml) were added, the mixture was stirred for 15 minutes at 0\ufffd C., filtered, and washed with water (2\ufffd75 ml). The isolated precipitate was treated with water (120 ml), 2N sodium hydroxide (60 ml), stirred for 30 min, filtered, cooled to 0\ufffd C., and 4 N hydrochloric acid (35 ml) was added. The title compound was isolated by filtration, washed thoroughly with water, recrystallized from methanol (1000 ml) and washed thoroughly with ether. This afforded 7.70 g (31%) of pure compound. The mother liquor from the recrystallization was reduced to a volume of 200 ml and cooled to 0\ufffd C. This afforded an additional 2.30 g of a material that was pure by tlc but had a reddish color.

Found(calc.); C: 55.41(55.45); H: 4.23(4.32); N: 14.04(13.86). 1H-NMR (90 MHz; DMSO-d6): 8.02 ppm (d,J=7.32 Hz,1H,H-6); 7.39 (s,5H, Ph) 7.01 (d,J=7.32 Hz,1H, H-5); 5.19 (s,2H,PhCH 2\u2014); 4.52 (s,2H)., 276941=Synthesis was initiated on 102 mg (dry weight) of preswollen (overnight in DCM) and neutralized Boc-Lys (ClZ)-MBHA resin. The steps performed were as follows: (1) Boc-deprotection with TFA/DCM (1:1, v/v), 1\ufffd2 min and 1\u05fdh, 3 ml; (2) washing with DCM, 4\ufffd20 sec, 3 ml; washing with DMF, 2\ufffd20 sec, 3 ml; washing with DCM, 2\ufffd20 sec, 3 ml, and drain for 30 sec; (3) neutralization with DIEA/DCM (1:19 v/v), 2\ufffd3 min, 3 ml; (4) washing with DCM, 4\ufffd20 sec, 3 ml, and drain for 1 min.; (5) addition of 4 equiv. diisopropyl carbodiimide (0.06 mmol; 9.7 \u03bcl) and 4 equiv.

Steps 1-12 were repeated until the desired sequence was obtained. All qualitative Kaiser tests were negative (straw-yellow colour with no coloration of the beads) indicating near 100% coupling yield. The PNA-oligomer was cleaved and purified by the normal procedure. FAB-MS: 2832.11 [M*+1] (calc. 2832.15), 335868=The fact that there is almost no loss in Tm in going from pH 7.2 to 9.0 indicates that Hoogsteen basepairing is not involved. The increase in Tm in going from 7.2 to 5 is large for the parallel orientation and is probably due to the formation of a 2:1 complex. It is believed that the most favorable orientation in the Watson-Crick binding motif is the 3\u2032/N-orientation and that in the Hoogsteen motif the 5\u2032/N-orientation is the most stable. Thus, it may be the case that the most stable complex is with the two PNA's strands anti parallel., 103266=Suitable choices for N-protection are the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group (Carpino, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1957, 79, 4427; McKay, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1957, 79, 4686; Anderson, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1957, 79, 6180) normally in combination with benzyl-based groups for the protection of side chains, and the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group (Carpino, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1970, 92, 5748 and J. Org. Chem., 1972, 37, 3404), normally in combination with tert-butyl (tBu) for the protection of any side chains, although a number of other possibilities exist which are well known in conventional solid-phase peptide synthesis. Thus, a wide range of other useful amino protecting groups exist, some of which are Adoc (Hass, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1966, 88, 1988), Bpoc (Sieber, Helv. Chem. Acta., 1968, 51, 614), Mcb (Brady, et al., J. Org. Chem., 1977, 42, 143), Bic (Kemp, et al., Tetrahedron, 1975, 4624), the o-nitrophenylsulfenyl (Nps) (Zervas, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1963, 85, 3660), and the dithiasuccinoyl (Dts) (Barany, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1977, 99, 7363). These amino protecting groups, particularly those based on the widely-used urethane functionality, successfully prohibit racemization (mediated by tautomerization of the readily formed oxazolinone (azlactone) intermediates (Goodman, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1964, 86, 2918)) during the coupling of most \u03b1-amino acids. In addition to such amino protecting groups, a whole range of otherwise \u201cworthless\u201d nonurethane-type of amino protecting groups are applicable when assembling PNA molecules, especially those built from achiral units. Thus, not only the above-mentioned amino protecting groups (or those derived from any of these groups) are useful within the context of the present invention, but virtually any amino protecting group which largely fulfills the following requirements: (1) stability to mild acids (not significantly attacked by carboxyl groups); (2) stability to mild bases or nucleophiles (not significantly attacked by the amino group in question); (3) resistance to acylation (not significantly attacked by activated amino acids). Additionally: (4) the protecting group must be close to quantitatively removable, without serious side reactions, and (5) the optical integrity, if any, of the incoming amino acid should preferably be highly preserved upon coupling. Finally, the choice of side-chain protecting groups, in general, depends on the choice of the amino protecting group, since the protection of side-chain functionalities must withstand the conditions of the repeated amino deprotection cycles. This is true whether the overall strategy for chemically assembling PNA molecules relies on, for example, differential acid stability of amino and side-chain protecting groups (such as is the case for the above-mentioned \u201cBoc-benzyl\u201d approach) or employs an orthogonal, that is, chemoselective, protection scheme (such as is the case for the above-mentioned \u201cFmoc-tBu\u201d approach),, 114134=Two other methods proposed for the simultaneous synthesis of large numbers of peptides also apply to the preparation of multiple, different PNA molecules. The first of these methods (Geysen, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1984, 81, 3998) utilizes acrylic acid-grafted polyethylene-rods and 96-microtiter wells to immobilize the growing peptide chains and to perform the compartmentalized synthesis. While highly effective, the method is only applicable on a microgram scale. The second method (Houghten, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1985, 82, 5131) utilizes a \u201ctea bag\u201d containing traditionally-used polymer beads. Other relevant proposals for multiple peptide or PNA synthesis in the context of the present invention include the simultaneous use of two different supports with different densities (Tregear, in \u201cChemistry and Biology of Peptides\u201d, J. Meienhofer, ed., Ann Arbor Sci. Publ., Ann Arbor, 1972 pp. 175-178), combining of reaction vessels via a manifold (Gorman, Anal. Biochem., 1984, 136, 397), multicolumn solid-phase synthesis (e.g. Krchnak, et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 1989, 33, 209), and Holm and Meldal, in \u201cProceedings of the 20th European Peptide Symposium\u201d, G. Jung and E. Bayer, eds., Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin, 1989 pp. 208-210), and the use of cellulose paper (Eichler, et al., Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1989, 54, 1746)., 183567=99.1 mg protected Acr1-[Taeg]10-Lys(ClZ)-BHA resin (dry weight) was cleaved as described in Example 27c to yield 42.2 mg of crude material. The main peak at 25.3 min (eluted at 23.5 min if injected from an aqueous solution instead of the 10% aqueous acetic acid solution) accounted for about 45% of the total absorbance. An 8.87 mg portion of the crude product was purified to give approximately 5.3 mg of >97% pure H-[Taeg]10-Lys-NH2. For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value was 2850.8 and the measured m/z value was 2849.8., 227641=Aminoethyl glycine (52.86 g; 0.447 mol) was dissolved in water (900 ml) and dioxane (900 ml) was added. The pH was adjusted to 11.2 with 2N NaOH. While the pH was kept at 11.2, tert-butyl-p-nitrophenyl carbonate (128.4 g; 0.537 mol) was dissolved in dioxane (720 ml) and added dropwise over the course of 2 hours. The pH was kept at 11.2 for at least three more hours and then left with stirring overnight. The yellow solution was cooled to 0\ufffd C. and the pH was adjusted to 3.5 with 2 N HCl. The mixture was washed with chloroform (4\ufffd100 ml), and the pH of the aqueous phase was readjusted to 9.5 with 2 N NaOH at 0\ufffd C. Benzyloxycarbonyl chloride (73.5 ml; 0.515 mol) was added over half an hour, while the pH was kept at 9.5 with 2 N NaOH. The pH was adjusted frequently over the next 4 hours, and the solution was left with stirring overnight. On the following day the solution was washed with ether (3\ufffd600 ml) and the pH of the solution was afterwards adjusted to 1.5 with 2 N HCl at 0\ufffd C. The title compound was isolated by extraction with ethyl acetate (5\ufffd1000 ml). The ethyl acetate solution was dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness, in vacuo. This afforded 138 g, which was dissolved in ether (300 ml) and precipitated by the addition of petroleum ether (1800 ml). Yield 124.7 g (79%). M.p. 64.5-85\ufffd C. Anal. for C17H24N2O6 found(calc.)

HPLC (260 nm) 20.71 min. (80.2%) and 21.57 min. (19.8%). The UV-spectra (200 nm-300 nm) are identical, indicating that the minor peak consists of Bis-Z-AEG., 118533=Whether manually or automatically operated, solid-phase PNA synthesis in the context of the present invention is normally performed batchwise. However, most of the syntheses may equally well be carried out in the continuous-flow mode, where the support is packed into columns (Bayer, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1970, 4503 and Scott, et al., J. Chromatogr. Sci., 1971, 9, 577). With respect to continuous-flow solid-phase synthesis, the rigid poly(dimethylacrylamide)-Kieselguhr support (Atherton, et al., J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., 1981, 1151) appears to be particularly successful, but another valuable configuration concerns the one worked out for the standard copoly(styrene-1%-divinylbenzene) support (Krchnak, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1987, 4469)., 325300=A preferred assay to test the ability of peptide nucleic acids to inhibit expression of the E2 mRNA of papillomavirus is based on the well-documented transactivation properties of E2. Spalholtz, et al., J. Virol., 1987, 61, 2128-2137. A reporter plasmid (E2RECAT) was constructed to contain the E2 responsive element, which functions as an E2 dependent enhancer. E2RECAT also contains the SV40 early promoter, an early polyadenylation signal, and the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (CAT). Within the context of this plasmid, CAT expression is dependent upon expression of E2. The dependence of CAT expression on the presence of E2 has been tested by transfection of this plasmid into C127 cells transformed by BPV-1, uninfected C127 cells and C127 cells cotransfected with E2RECAT and an E2 expression vector., 233845=The material from above was suspended in THF (194 ml, gives a 0.2 M solution), and 1 M aqueous lithium hydroxide (116 ml) was added. The mixture was stirred for 45 minutes at ambient temperature and then filtered to remove residual DCU. Water (40 ml) was added to the solution which was then washed with methylene chloride (300 ml). Additional water (30 ml) was added, and the alkaline solution was washed once more with methylene chloride (150 ml). The aqueous solution was cooled to 0\ufffd C. and the pH was adjusted to 2 by the dropwise addition of 1 N HCl (approx. 110 ml). The title compound was extracted with ethyl acetate (9\ufffd200 ml), the combined extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate and were evaporated to dryness, in vacuo. The residue was evaporated once from methanol, which after drying overnight afforded a colorless glassy solid. Yield 9.57 g (64%). HPLC >98% RT=14.8 min .

Due to the limited rotation around the secondary amide, several of the signals were doubled in the ratio 2:1 (indicated in the list by mj. for major and mi. for minor). 1H-NMR (250 MHz, DMSO-d6): 12.75 (b.s., 1H, CO2H); 11.28 (s, \u201c1H\u201d, mj., imide NH); 11.26 (s, \u201c1H\u201d, mi., imide NH); 7.30 (s, \u201c1H\u201d, mj., T H-6); 7.26 (s, \u201c1H\u201d, mi., T H-6); 6.92 (b.t., \u201c1H\u201d, mj., BOcNH); 6.73 (b.t., \u201c1H\u201d, mi., BOcNH); 4.64 (s, \u201c2H\u201d, mj., CH 2CON); 4.46 (s, \u201c2H\u201d, mj., CH 2CON); 4.19 (s, \u201c2H\u201d, mi., CH 2CO2H); 3.97 (s, \u201c2H\u201d, mj., CH 2CO2H); 3.63-3.01 (unresolved m, includes water, CH 2CH 2); 1.75 (s, 3H, CH 3) and 1.38 (s, 9H, tBu)., 101798=An alternative strategy concerning the introduction of spacer or handle groups is the so-called \u201cpreformed handle\u201d strategy (see, Tam, et al., Synthesis, 1979, 955-957), which offers complete control over coupling of the first amino acid, and excludes the possibility of complications arising from the presence of undesired functional groups not related to the peptide or PNA synthesis. In this strategy, spacer or handle groups, of the same type as described above, are reacted with the first amino acid desired to be bound to the solid support, the amino acid being N-protected and optionally protected at the other side-chains which are not relevant with respect to the growth of the desired PNA chain. Thus, in those cases in which a spacer or handle group is desirable, the first amino acid to be coupled to the solid support can either be coupled to the free reactive end of a spacer group which has been bound to the initially introduced functionality (for example, an aminomethyl group) or can be reacted with the spacer-forming reagent. The space-forming reagent is then reacted with the initially introduced functionality. Other useful anchoring schemes include the \u201cmultidetachable\u201d resins (Tam, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1979, 4935 and J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1980, 102, 611; Tam, J. Org. Chem., 1985, 50, 5291), which provide more than one mode of release and thereby allow more flexibility in synthetic design., 91156=Both the fos and the jun cDNA have been cloned downstream of the Sp6 promoter. RNA is produced from each plasmid in vitro, then used to produce functional jun and fos proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lystates. The fos and jun proteins are then allowed to bind to the biotinylated AP-1 binding site in competition with PNA duplex sequences constructed as mimics of the proper consensus sequence for binding fos and jun, CGC TTG GTG ACT CAG CCG GAA (SEQ ID NO: 8). Binding is quantitated with an antibody directed to fos or jun. When the fos alone is incubated with the AP-1 site there will be no detectable binding with either antibody. When the jun alone is incubated with the binding site, a signal will be detected with only the jun antibody. This is consistent with the formation of a jun homodimer, which has previously been demonstrated to bind AP-1. When the fos and jun proteins are mixed a signal will be detected with both fos and jun antibodies. This is consistent with the formation of a fos/jun homodimer which is known to bind the AP-1 site and should be detectable with either antibody., 436514=(Bocaminoethyl)glycine ethyl ester (2.00 g; 8.12 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (10 ml). Dhbt-OH (1.46 g; 8.93 mmol) was added and a precipitate was formed. DMF (2\ufffd10 ml) was added until all was dissolved. The product of Example 124 (1.52 g; 8.93 mmol) was added slowly to avoid precipitation. Methylene chloride (30 ml) was added, and the mixture was cooled to 0\ufffd C., whereafter DDC (2.01 g; 9.74 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at 0\ufffd C., at 2 h at room temperature, and then filtered. The precipitated DCU was washed twice with methylene chloride. To combined filtrate was added methylene chloride (100 ml), and the solution washed with half-saturated NaHCO3-solution (3\ufffd100 ml, H2O: saturated NaHCO3-solution 1:1 v/v), then with dilute KHSO4-solution (2\ufffd100 ml, H2O: saturated KHSO4-solution 4:1 v/v) and finally with saturated NaCl-solution (1\ufffd100 ml). The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and evaporated to dryness in vacuo (about 15 mmHg and then about 1 mmHg). The residue was suspended in methylene chloride (32 ml), and stirred for 35 min at room temperature, and 30 min at 0\ufffd C., and then filtered. The precipitate (DCU) was washed with methylene chloride. Petroleum ether (2 volumes) was added dropwise to the combined filtrate at 0\ufffd C., which caused separation of an oil. The mixture was decanted, the remaining oil was then dissolved in methylene chloride (20 ml), and then again precipitated by addition of petroleum ether (2 volumes). This procedure was repeated 5 times until an impurity was removed. The impurity can be seen by TLC with 10% MeOH/CH2Cl2 as the developing solvent. The resulting oil was dissolved in methylene chloride (20 ml) and evaporated to dryness in vacuo, which caused solidification of the title compound. Yield: 1.71 g (53%). Mp. 68.5\ufffd-75.7\ufffd C.

Crude product (85.8 mg) was purified to give 46.2 mg of H-Caeg-Taeg-Caeg-Taeg-[Caeg]3-Taeg-Caeg-Taeg-LysNH2. For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value was 2717.15 and the measured m/z value was 2716.93., 152114=Except where otherwise stated, the following applies. The PNA compounds were synthezised by the stepwise solid-phase approach (Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1963, 85, 2149) employing conventional peptide chemistry utilizing the TFA-labile tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group for \u201ctemporary\u201d N-protection (Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1964, 86, 304) and the more acid-stable benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl (ClZ) groups for \u201cpermanent\u201d side chain protection. To obtain C-terminal amides, the PNAs were assembled onto the HF-labile BHA or MBHA resins (the MBHA resin has increased susceptibility to the final HF cleavage relative to the unsubstituted BHA resin (Matsueda, et al., Peptides, 1981, 2, 45). All reactions (except HF reactions) were carried out in manually operated standard solid-phase reaction vessels fitted with a coarse glass frit (Merrifield, et al., Biochemistry, 1982, 21, 5020). The quantitative ninhydrin reaction (Kaiser test), originally developed by Merrifield and co-workers (Sarin, et al., Anal. Biochem., 1981, 117, 147) for peptides containing \u201cnormal\u201d amino acids, was successfully applied (see Table I-III) using the \u201cnormally\u201d employed effective extinction coefficient \u03b5=15000 M\u22121cm\u22121 for all residues to determine the completeness of the individual couplings as well as to measure the number of growing peptide chains. The theoretical substitution Sn\u22121 upon coupling of residue number n (assuming both complete deprotection and coupling as well as neither chain termination nor loss of PNA chains during the synthetic cycle) is calculated from the equation:, 322484=A mixture of 100 ng plasmid DNA (cleaved with restriction enzyme PvuII (see below) and 100 ng of PNA in 15 \u03bcl 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 was incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 60 min. Subsequently, 4 \u03bcl 5\ufffd concentrated buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 40 mM MgCl2, 10 mM spermidine, 125 mM NaCl) were mixed with 1 \u03bcl NTP-mix (10 mM ATP, 10 mM CTP, 10 mM GTP, 1 MM UTP, 0.1 \u03bcCi/\u03bcl 32P-UTP, 5 mM DTT, 2 \u03bcg/ml tRNA, 1 \u03bcg/ml heparin) and 3 units RNA polymerase.

The incorporation of the monomers followed the protocol of example 55, except for step 5 (incorporation of the BocA(Z)aeg-OH monomer). New step 5 (incorporation of A(Z)aeg) involved addition of 4 equiv. diisopropyl carbodiimide (0.06 mmol; 9.7 \u03bcl) and 4 equiv.

No. 08/088,658, filed Jul. 2, 1993. This patent application also is a continuation-in-part of patent application Ser. No. 08/054,363, filed Apr. 26, 1993 now U.S. Pat.

The entire contents of each of the foregoing patent applications are incorporated herein by reference., 119337=While the solid-phase technique is presently preferred in the context of PNA synthesis, other methodologies or combinations thereof, for example, in combination with the solid-phase technique, apply as well: (1) the classical solution-phase methods for peptide synthesis (e.g., Bodanszky, \u201cPrinciples of Peptide Synthesis\u201d, Springer-Verlag, Berlin-New York 1984), either by stepwise assembly or by segment/fragment condensation, are of particular relevance when considering especially large scale productions (gram, kilogram, and even tons) of PNA compounds; (2) the so-called \u201cliquid-phase\u201d strategy, which utilizes soluble polymeric supports such as linear polystyrene (Shemyakin, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1965, 2323) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Mutter and Bayer, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl., 1974, 13, 88), is useful; (3) random polymerization (see, e.g., Odian, \u201cPrinciples of Polymerization\u201d, McGraw-Hill, New York (1970)) yielding mixtures of many molecular weights (\u201cpolydisperse\u201d) peptide or PNA molecules are particularly relevant for purposes such as screening for antiviral effects; (4) a technique based on the use of polymer-supported amino acid active esters (Fridkin, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1965, 87, 4646), sometimes referred to as \u201cinverse Merrifield synthesis\u201d or \u201cpolymeric reagent synthesis\u201d, offers the advantage of isolation and purification of intermediate products, and may thus provide a particularly suitable method for the synthesis of medium-sized, optionally protected, PNA molecules, that can subsequently be used for fragment condensation into larger PNA molecules; (5) it is envisaged that PNA molecules may be assembled enzymatically by enzymes such as proteases or derivatives thereof with novel specificities (obtained, for example, by artificial means such as protein engineering). Also, one can envision the development of \u201cPNA ligases\u201d for the condensation of a number of PNA fragments into very large PNA molecules; (6) since antibodies can be generated to virtually any molecule of interest, the recently developed catalytic antibodies (abzymes), discovered simultaneously by the groups of Lerner (Tramantano, et al., Science, 1986, 234, 1566) and of Schultz (Pollack, et al., Science, 1986, 234, 1570), should also be considered as potential candidates for assembling PNA molecules. Thus, there has been considerable success in producing abzymes catalyzing acyl-transfer reactions (see for example Shokat, et al., Nature, 1989, 338, 269) and references therein). Finally, completely artificial enzymes, very recently pioneered by Stewart's group (Hahn, et al., Science, 1990, 248, 1544), may be developed to suit PNA synthesis. The design of generally applicable enzymes, ligases, and catalytic antibodies, capable of mediating specific coupling reactions, should be more readily achieved for PNA synthesis than for \u201cnormal\u201d peptide synthesis since PNA molecules will often be comprised of only four different amino acids (one for each of the four native nucleobases) as compared to the twenty natural by occurring (proteinogenic) amino acids constituting peptides. In conclusion, no single strategy may be wholly suitable for the synthesis of a specific PNA molecule, and therefore, sometimes a combination of methods may work best., 382230=The protected Boc-[Taeg]4-(NBaeg)-[Taeg]5-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin was treated as described in Example 27c to yield about 33.6 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 108.9 mg dry H-[Taeg]4-(NBaeg)-[Taeg]5-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin. Crude product (20.6 mg) was purified to give 4.6 mg of H-[Taeg]4-(NBaeg)-[Taeg]5-Lys-NH2. For (M+H)+, the calculated m/z value was 2683.12 and the measured m/z value was 2683.09., 97424=The principle of anchoring molecules onto a solid matrix, which helps in accounting for intermediate products during chemical transformations, is known as Solid-Phase Synthesis or Merrifield Synthesis (see, e.g., Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1963, 85, 2149 and Science, 1986, 232, 341). Established methods for the stepwise or fragmentwise solid-phase assembly of amino acids into peptides normally employ a beaded matrix of slightly cross-linked styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer, the cross-linked copolymer having been formed by the pearl polymerization of styrene monomer to which has been added a mixture of divinylbenzenes. A level of 1-2% cross-linking is usually employed. Such a matrix also can be used in solid-phase PNA synthesis in accordance with the present invention (FIG. 4)., 386629=The protected Boc-[Taeg]4-Gly2-[Taeg]5-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin was treated as described in Example 27c to yield about 32.6 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 156.6 mg dry H-[Taeg]4-Gly2-[Taeg]5-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin. Crude product (30 mg) was purified to give 7.8 mg of H-[Taeg]4-Gly2-[Taeg]5-Lys-NH2. For (M+H)+, the calculated m/z value was 2655.09 and the measured m/z value was 2655.37., 251258=2-Amino-6-benzyloxy-9-carboxymethyl-purine (0.50 g; 1.67 mmol), methyl-N(2-[tert-butoxycarbonylamino]ethyl)glycinate (0.65 g; 2.80 mmol), diisopropylethyl amine (0.54 g; 4.19 mmol), and bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium-hexafluoro-phosphate (PyBroP\ufffd) (0.798 g; 1.71 mmol) were stirred in DMF (2 ml) for 4 h. The clear solution was poured into an ice-cooled solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate (1 N; 40 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3\ufffd40 ml). The organic layer was washed with potassium hydrogen sulfate solution (1 N; 2\ufffd40 ml), sodium hydrogen carbonate (1 N; 1\ufffd40 ml) and saturated sodium chloride solution (60 ml). After drying with anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporation, in vacuo, the solid residue was recrystallized from ethyl acetate/hexane (20 ml (2:1)) to give the methyl ester in 63% yield (MS-FAB 514 (M+1). Hydrolysis was accomplished by dissolving the ester in ethanol/water (30 ml (1:2)) containing conc. sodium hydroxide (1 ml). After stirring for 2 h, the solution was filtered and acidified to a pH of 3, by the addition of 4 N hydrochloric acid. The title compound was obtained by filtration. Yield: 370 mg (72% for the hydrolysis). Purity by HPLC was more than 99%. Due to the limited rotation around the secondary amide several of the signals were doubled in the ratio 2:1 (indicated in the list by mj. for major and mi. for minor). 1H-NMR(250, MHz, DMSO-d6): d=1.4 ppm.

Triethyl amine (1.12 ml; 0.00812 mol) was added and the mixture stirred overnight. After addition of methylene chloride (200 ml) the organic phase was extracted with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (3\ufffd250 ml), half-sat. aqueous potassium hydrogen sulfate (3\ufffd250 ml), and sat. aqueous sodium chloride (250 ml) and dried over magnesium sulfate. Filtration and evaporation to dryness, in vacuo, resulted in 2.9 g (99%) yield (oil). 1H-NMR (250 MHz; CDCl3): due to limited rotation around the secondary amide several of the signals were doubled; \u03b41.43 (s, 9H); 1.88 (s, 3H); 2.63 (t, 1H); 2.74 (t, 1H); 3.25-3.55 (4\ufffdt, 8H); 3.65 (2\ufffdt, 2H); 3.66 (s, 1.5); 3.72 (s, 1.5); 4.61 (s, 1H); 4.72 (s, 2H); 5.59 (s, 0.5H); 5.96 (s, 0.5H); 7.11 (s, 1H); 10.33 (s, 1H)., 129247=The title compound was prepared by a modification of the procedure by Heimer, et al. Int. J. Pept. , 1984, 23, 203-211 N-(2-Aminoethyl)glycine (1, 3.00 g; 25.4 mmol) was dissolved in water (50 ml), dioxane (50 ml) was added, and the pH was adjusted to 11.2 with 2 N sodium hydroxide. tert-Butyl-4-nitrophenyl carbonate (7.29 g; 30.5 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane (40 ml) and added dropwise over a period of 2 h, during which time the pH was maintained at 11.2 with 2 N sodium hydroxide. The pH was adjusted periodically to 11.2 for three more hours and then the solution was left overnight. The solution was cooled to 0\ufffd C. and the pH was carefully adjusted to 3.5 with 0.5 M hydrochloric acid. The aqueous solution was washed with chloroform (3\ufffd200 ml), the pH adjusted to 9.5 with 2N sodium hydroxide and the solution was evaporated to dryness, in vacuo (14 mmHg). The residue was extracted with DMF (25+2\ufffd10 ml) and the extracts filtered to remove excess salt. This results in a solution of the title compound in about 60% yield and greater than 95% purity by tlc (system 1 and visualised with ninhydrin, Rf=0.3). The solution was used in the following preparations of Boc-aeg derivates without further purification., 87648=A series of PNA-PNA duplexes is synthesized and hybridized to give a new series of PNA duplexes corresponding to different length portions of the myc-c binding sequence. Each duplex is incubated in triplicate at concentrations of 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 \u03bcM with the HL-60 extract described above. The myc P=S binding site then is added and the mixtures are incubated and washed with PBS. An antibody directed to the leucine zipper region of the myc protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) is added at a 1:1000 dilution. Non-bound molecules are washed away with PBS. Binding of myc to biotinylated c-myc transcription factor is quantitated by adding 100 \u03bcl of 1:500 tat antisera to each well for 2 hours. Protein A/G-alkaline phosphatase (Pierce; 1:5000; 100 \u03bcl) then is added and any excess is removed by washing with PBS. PNPP substrate (200 \u03bcl) then is added. Color development is measured 2 hours later by reading absorbance at 405 nM on a Titertek Multiscan ELISA plate reader., 415012=About 0.3 g of wet H-[Taeg]2-C(Z)aeg-[Taeg]4-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin from the earlier synthesis of Boc-[Taeg]5-C(Z)aeg-[Taeg]4-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin was placed in a 5 ml SPPS reaction vessel. After coupling of the next residue five times, a total incorporation of BocC(Z)aeg of 87% was obtained. The five repeated couplings were carried out with 0.18 M BocC(Z)aeg-OPfp in 2 ml of TFE/CH2Cl2 (1:2, v/v), 2 ml of TFE/CH2Cl2 (1:2, v/v) , 2 ml of TFE/CH2Cl2 (1:2, v/v) with two drops of dioxane and two drops of DIEA (this condition gave only a few per cent coupling yield), 2 ml of TFE/CH2Cl2 (1:2, v/v) plus 0.5 g phenol, and 1 ml of CH2Cl2 plus 0.4 g of phenol, respectively. The two final Taeg residues were incorporated close to quantitatively by double couplings with 0.25 M BocTaeg-OPfp in 25% phenol/CH2Cl2. All couplings were allowed to proceed overnight., 98256=Concerning the initial functionalization of the solid phase, more than fifty methods have been described in connection with traditional solid-phase peptide synthesis (see, e.g., Barany and Merrifield in \u201cThe Peptides\u201d Vol. 2, Academic Press, New York, 1979, pp. 1-284, and Stewart and Young, \u201cSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis\u201d, 2nd Ed., Pierce Chemical Company, Ill., 1984). Reactions for the introduction of chloromethyl functionality (Merrifield resin; via a chloromethyl methyl ether/SnCl4 reaction), aminomethyl functionality (via an N-hydroxymethylphthalimide reaction; see, Mitchell, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1976, 3795), and benzhydrylamino functionality (Pietta, et al., J. Chem. Soc., 1970, 650) are the most widely applied. Regardless of its nature, the purpose of the functionality is normally to form an anchoring linkage between the copolymer solid support and the C-terminus of the first amino acid to be coupled to the solid support. As will be recognized, anchoring linkages also can be formed between the solid support and the amino acid N-terminus. It is generally convenient to express the \u201cconcentration\u201d of a functional group in terms of millimoles per gram (mmol/g). Other reactive functionalities which have been initially introduced include 4-methylbenzhydrylamino and 4-methoxybenzhydrylamino. All of these established methods are in principle useful within the context of the present invention. Preferred methods for PNA synthesis employ aminomethyl as the initial functionality, in that aminomethyl is particularly advantageous with respect to the incorporation of \u201cspacer\u201d or \u201chandle\u201d groups, owing to the reactivity of the amino group of the aminomethyl functionality with respect to the essentially quantitative formation of amide bonds to a carboxylic acid group at one end of the spacer-forming reagent. A vast number of relevant spacer- or handle-forming bifunctional reagents have been described (see, Barany, et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 1987, 30, 705), especially reagents which are reactive towards amino groups such as found in the aminomethyl function. Representative bifunctional reagents include 4-(haloalkyl)aryl-lower alkanoic acids such as 4-(bromomethyl)phenylacetic acid, Boc-aminoacyl-4-(oxymethyl)aryl-lower alkanoic acids such as Boc-aminoacyl-4-(oxymethyl)phenylacetic acid, N-Boc-p-acylbenzhydrylamines such as N-Boc-p-glutaroylbenzhydrylamine, N-Boc-4\u2032-lower alkyl-p-acylbenzhydrylamines such as N-Boc-4\u2032-methyl-p-glutaroylbenzhydrylamine, N-Boc-4\u2032-lower alkoxy-p-acylbenzhydrylamines such as N-Boc-4\u2032-methoxy-p-glutaroyl-benzhydrylamine, and 4-hydroxymethylphenoxyacetic acid. One type of spacer group particularly relevant within the context of the present invention is the phenylacetamidomethyl (Pam) handle (Mitchell and Merrifield, J. Org. Chem., 1976, 41, 2015) which, deriving from the electron withdrawing effect of the 4-phenylacetamidomethyl group, is about 100 times more stable than the classical benzyl ester linkage towards the Boc-amino deprotection reagent trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)., 94192=A phosphorothioate oligonucleotide is prepared in the standard manner on a solid support as per standard protocols (see Oligonucleotides and Analogues, A Practical Approach, F. Eckstein Ed., IRL Press, 1991. The dimethoxytrityl blocking group on that nucleotide is removed in the standard manner. Peptide synthesis for the peptide region is commenced by reaction of the carboxyl end of the first peptide nucleic acid of this region with the 5\u2032 hydroxy of the last nucleotide of the DNA region. Coupling is effected via EDC (Pierce) in pyridine to form an ester linkage between the peptide and the nucleoside. Peptide synthesis is then continued in the manner of patent application WO 92/20702 to complete the peptide nucleic acid region., 283148=The protected Boc-[Taeg]2-A(Z)aeg-[Taeg]5-Lys(ClZ)-BHA resin was treated as described in Example 27c to yield about 16.2 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 102.5 mg dry H-[Taeg]2-A(Z)aeg-[Taeg]5-Lys(ClZ)-BHA resin. A small portion of the crude product was purified. For (MH+)*, the calculated m/z value was 2050.85 and the measured m/z value was 2050.90, 396042=The protected Boc-Tyr(BrZ)-[C(Z)aeg]2-[Taeg]2-[C(Z)aeg]3-[Taeg]2-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin was treated as described in Example 27c to yield about 57.6 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 172.7 mg dry H-Tyr(BrZ)-[C(Z)aeg]2-[Taeg]2-[C(Z)aeg]3-[Taeg]2-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin. Crude product (47.1 mg) was purified to give 13.4 mg of H-Tyr-[Caeg]2-[Taeg]2-[Caeg]3-[Taeg]2-Lys-NH2. For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value was 2629.11 and the measured m/z value was 2629.11., 388228=The protected Boc-[Taeg]4-[C[Z]aeg]2-Taeg-C[Z]aeg-Taeg-C[Z]aeg-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin was treated as described in Example 27c to yield about 52.1 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 216.7 mg dry H-[Taeg]4-[C[Z]aeg]2-Taeg-C[Z]aeg-Taeg-C[Z]aeg-Lys(CLZ)-MBHA resin. Crude product (30.6 mg) was purified to give 6.2 mg of H-[Taeg]4-[Caeg]2-Taeg-Caeg-Taeg-Caeg-Lys-NH2. For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value was 2747.15 and the measured m/z value was 2746.78., 396667=The protected Boc-Taeg-[C(Z)aeg]2-[Taeg]2-[C(Z)aeg]3-[Taeg]2-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin was treated as described in Example 27c to yield about 53.4 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 42.4 mg dry H-Taeg-[C(Z)aeg]2-[Taeg]2-[C(Z)aeg]3-[Taeg]2-Lys(ClZ)-MBHA resin. Crude product (11.9 mg) was purified to give 4.3 mg of H-Taeg-[Caeg]2-[Taeg]2-[Caeg]3-[Taeg]2-Lys-NH2. For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value was 2732.15; the m/z value was not measured., 115582=While the conventional cross-linked styrene/divinylbenzene copolymer matrix and the PEPS support are presently preferred in the context of solid-phase PNA synthesis, a non-limiting list of examples of solid supports which may be of relevance are: (1) Particles based upon copolymers of dimethylacrylamide cross-linked with N,N\u2032-bisacryloylethylenediamine, including a known amount of N-tertbutoxycarbonyl-beta-alanyl-N\u2032-acryloylhexamethylenediamine. Several spacer molecules are typically added via the beta alanyl group, followed thereafter by the amino acid residue subunits. Also, the beta alanyl-containing monomer can be replaced with an acryloyl sarcosine monomer during polymerization to form resin beads. The polymerization is followed by reaction of the beads with ethylenediamine to form resin particles that contain primary amines as the covalently linked functionality. The polyacrylamide-based supports are relatively more hydrophilic than are the polystyrene-based supports and are usually used with polar aprotic solvents including dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and the like (see Atherton, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1975, 97, 6584, Bioorg. Chem. 1979, 8, 351), and J. C. S. Perkin I 538 (1981)); (2) a second group of solid supports is based on silica-containing particles such as porous glass beads and silica gel. One example is the reaction product of trichloro-[3-(4-chloromethyl)phenyl]propylsilane and porous glass beads (see Parr and Grohmann, Angew. Chem. Internal. Ed. 1972, 11, 314) sold under the trademark \u201cPORASIL E\u201d by Waters Associates, Framingham, Mass., USA. Similarly, a mono ester of 1,4-dihydroxymethylbenzene and silica (sold under the trademark \u201cBIOPAK\u201d by Waters Associates) has been reported to be useful (see Bayer and Jung, Tetrahedron Lett., 1970, 4503); (3) a third general type of useful solid supports can be termed composites in that they contain two major ingredients: a resin and another material that is also substantially inert to the organic synthesis reaction conditions employed. One exemplary composite (see Scott, et al., J. Chrom. Sci., 1971, 9, 577) utilized glass particles coated with a hydrophobic, cross-linked styrene polymer containing reactive chloromethyl groups, and was supplied by Northgate Laboratories, Inc., of Hamden, Conn., USA. Another exemplary composite contains a core of fluorinated ethylene polymer onto which has been grafted polystyrene (see Kent and Merrifield, Israel J. Chem. 1978, 17, 243) and van Rietschoten in \u201cPeptides 1974\u201d, Y. Wolman, Ed., Wiley and Sons, New York, 1975, pp. 113-116); and (4) contiguous solid supports other than PEPS, such as cotton sheets (Lebl and Eichler, Peptide Res. 1989, 2, 232) and hydroxypropylacrylate-coated polypropylene membranes (Daniels, et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 4345), are suited for PNA synthesis as well., 182779=A portion of protected Boc-[Taeg]10-Lys (ClZ)-BHA resin was treated as described in Example 27c to yield 1.7 mg of crude material upon HF cleavage of 7.0 mg dry H-[Taeg]10-Lys(ClZ)-BHA resin. The main peak at 15.1 min (eluted at 17.0 min if injected from an aqueous solution instead of the 10% aqueous acetic acid solution) accounted for about 50% of the total absorbance. About 1.2 mg of the crude product was purified to give approximately 0.2 mg of >95% pure H-[Taeg]10-Lys-NH2. FIG. 10a. For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value was 2807.8 and the measured m/z value was 2808.2., 431017=The product of Example 121 (1.96 g; 4.11 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (30 ml) by heating, and then cooled to 0\ufffd C. Sodium hydroxide (2M, 30 ml) was added, and the mixture stirred for 30 min. HCl (1M, 70 ml) was added to pH=2.0. The water phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (3\ufffd65 ml+7\ufffd40 ml). The combined ethyl acetate extractions were washed with saturated NaCl-solution (500 ml). The ethyl acetate phase was dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and evaporated to dryness in vacuo.

In order to get this value, 1.5 mmol of Boc-Lys(ClZ) was coupled to 5.0 g of neutralized and preswollen MBHA resin (determined by the quantitative ninhydrin reaction to contain 0.64 mmol NH2/g) using a single \u201cin situ\u201d coupling (1.5 mmol of DCC) in 60 ml of CH2Cl2. The reaction was carried out by shaking for 3 h in a manually operated, 225 ml, standard, solid-phase reaction vessel. Unreacted amino groups were then blocked by acetylation with a mixture of acetic anhydride/pyridine/CH2Cl2 (1:1:2, v/v/v) for 18 h. A quantitative ninhydrin reaction on the neutralized resin showed that only 0.00093 mmol/g free amine remained (see Table I), i.e. 0.15% of the original amino groups. The degree of substitution was estimated by deprotection and ninhydrin analysis, and was found to be 0.32 mmol/g for the neutralized H-Lys (ClZ)-MBHA resin. This compares well with the maximum value of 0.28 mmol/g for a quantitative coupling of 0.30 mmol Boc-Lys(ClZ)/g resin (see Table II)., 253369=3-Amino-1,2-propanediol (40.00 g, 0.440 mol, 1.0 eq.) was dissolved in water (1000 ml) and cooled to 0\ufffd C. Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (115.0 g, 0.526 mol, 1.2 eq.) was added in one portion. The reaction mixture was heated to room temperature on a water bath during stirring. The pH was maintained at 10.5 with a solution of sodium hydroxide (17.56 g, 0.440 mol, 1.0 eq.) in water (120 ml). When the addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide was completed, the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Subsequently, ethyl acetate (750 ml) was added to the reaction mixture, followed by cooling to 0\ufffd C. The pH was adjusted to 2.5 with 4 N sulphuric acid with vigorous stirring. The phases were separated and the water phase was washed with additional ethyl acetate (6\ufffd350 ml). The volume of the organic phase was reduced to 900 ml by evaporation under reduced pressure. The organic phase then was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of potassium hydrogen sulfate diluted to twice its volume (1\ufffd1000 ml) and with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (1\ufffd500 ml). The organic phase was dried (MgSO4) and evaporated under reduced pressure to yield 50.12 g (60%) of the title compound. The product could be solidified by evaporation from methylene chloride and subsequent freezing. 1H-NMR (CDCl3/TMS): d=1.43 (s, 9H, Me3C), 3.25 (m, 2H, CH2), 3.57 (m, 2H, CH2), 3.73 (m, 1H, CH). 13C-NMR (CDCl3/TMS): d=28.2 (Me3C), 42.6 (CH2), 63.5, 71.1 (CH2OH, CHOH), 79.5 (Me3C), 157.0 (C\u2550O)., 84465=Samples of PNAs corresponding to various TAR sequences prepared by the method of Example 1 are incubated with recombinant tat transcription factor (100 \u03bcM) for 15 minutes at room temperature at 1, 3, 10 ,30, and 100 \u03bcM (see, e.g., Cullen, et al., Cell 1990, 63, 655.). A competitor, a truncated version of the TAR sequence corresponding to residues 16-45 as a 2\u2032-O-methyl oligonucleotide, is employed as a TAR sequence and is biotinylated at the 3\u2032-O end by procedures generally in accordance with the protocols of application Ser. No. 08/032,852, Combinatorial Oligomer Immunoabsorbant Screening Assay For Transcription Factors And Other Biomolecule Binding, filed Mar. 16, 1993, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This TAR sequence is added at 100 nM concentration. The reaction is incubated for 20 minutes and then added to streptavidin-coated microtiter plate wells. After unbound molecules are washed away with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 100 \u03bcL of 1:500 tat antisera is added to each well and incubated for 2 hours. Protein A/G antisera phosphatase is bound to the tat antibodies and PNPP (p-nitrophenylphosphate) substrate (200 \u03bcl) then is added. Color development is measured 2 hours later by reading absorbance at 405 nM on a Titertek Multiscan ELISA plate reader., 172714=A portion of protected Boc-[Taeg]5-BHA resin was treated with 50% trifluoroacetic acid in methylene chloride to remove the N-terminal Boc group (which is a precursor of the potentially harmful tert-butyl cation) prior to the HF cleavage. Following neutralization and washing (performed in a way similar to those of steps 2-4 in \u201cSynthetic Protocol 1\u201d), and drying for 2 h in vacuum, the resulting 67.1 mg (dry weight) of H-[Taeg]5-BHA resin was cleaved with 5 ml of HF:anisole (9:1, v/v) stirring at 0\ufffd C. for 60 min. After removal of HF, the residue was stirred with dry diethyl ether (4\ufffd15 ml, 15 min each) to remove anisole, filtered under gravity through a fritted glass funnel, and dried. The PNA was then extracted into a 60 ml (4\ufffd15 ml, stirring 15 min each) 10% aqueous acetic acid solution. Aliquots of this solution were analyzed by analytical reverse-phase HPLC to establish the purity of the crude PNA. The main peak at 13.0 min accounted for about 93% of the total absorbance. The remaining solution was frozen and lyophilized to afford about 22.9 mg of crude material. Finally, 19.0 mg of the crude product was purified from five batches, each containing 3.8 mg in 1 ml of H2O. The main peak was collected by use of a semi-preparative reverse-phase column. Acetonitrile was removed on a speed vac and the residual solution was frozen (dry ice) and subsequently lyophilized to give 13.1 mg of >99% pure H-[Taeg]5-NH2. The PNA molecule readily dissolved in water and had the correct molecular weight based on mass spectral determination. For (M+H)+ the calculated m/z value was 1349.3 and the measured m/z value was 1347.8., 247600=N6-Benzyloxycarbonyl-1-(Boc-aeg)adenine ethyl ester (1.48 g; 2.66 mmol) was suspended in THF (13 ml) and the mixture was cooled to 0\ufffd C. Lithium hydroxide (8 ml; 1 N) was added. After 15 min of stirring, the reaction mixture was filtered, extra water (25 ml) was added, and the solution was washed with methylene chloride (2\ufffd25 ml). The pH of the aqueous solution was adjusted to pH 2.0 with 1 N HCl. The precipitate was isolated by filtration, washed with water, and dried, and drief affording 0.82 g (58%). The product reprecipitated twice with methylene chloride/petroleum ether, 0.77 g (55%) after drying. M.p. 119\ufffd C. (decomp.) Anal. for C24H29N7O7\ufffdH2O found(calc.)

(see, e.g., Gilmore, et al., Cell 1986, 62, 791.), 230543=The oil was dissolved in absolute ethanol (600 ml) and was added 10% palladium on carbon (6.6 g) was added. The solution was hydrogenated at atmospheric pressure, where the reservoir was filled with 2 N sodium hydroxide. After 4 hours, 3.3 L was consumed out of the theoretical 4.2 L. The reaction mixture was filtered through celite and evaporated to dryness, in vacuo, affording 39.5 g (94%) of an oily substance. A 13 g portion of the oily substance was purified by silica gel (600 g SiO2) chromatography. After elution with 300 ml 20% petroleum ether in methylene chloride, the title compound was eluted with 1700 ml of 5% methanol in methylene chloride. The solvent was removed from the fractions with satisfactory purity, in vacuo and the yield was 8.49 g. Alternatively 10 g of the crude material was purified by Kugel Rohr distillation. 1H-NMR (250 MHz, CD3OD); 4.77 (b. s, NH); 4.18 (q, 2H, MeCH 2\u2014); 3.38 (s, 2H, NCH 2CO2Et); 3.16 (t, 2H, BocNHCH 2CH2); 2.68 (t, 2H, BocNHCH2CH 2); 1.43 (s, 9H, tBu) and 1.26 (t, 3H, CH3) 13C-NMR 171.4 (COEt); 156.6 (CO); 78.3 ((CH3)3 C); 59.9 (CH2); 49.0 (CH2); 48.1 (CH2); 39.0 (CH2); 26.9 (CH2) and 12.6 (CH3)., 69831=Transcription factors, as the term is used herein, are DNA- or RNA-binding proteins that regulate the expression of genes. HIV tat and c-rel are examples of transcription factors which regulate the expression of genes. Also encompassed by the term are DNA and RNA binding proteins which are not strictly considered transcription factors, but which are known to be involved in cell proliferation. These transcription factors include c-myc, fos, and jun. Methods of the present invention are particularly suitable for use with transcription factor as target molecules since transcription factors generally occur in very small cellular quantities., 106943=The next desired N-protected amino acid is then coupled to the N-terminal of the last-coupled amino acid. This coupling of the C-terminal of an amino acid with the N-terminal of the last-coupled amino acid can be achieved in several ways. For example, it can be bound by providing the incoming amino acid in a form with the carboxyl group activated by any of several methods, including the initial formation of an active ester derivative such as a 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl ester (Pless, et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 1963, 46, 1609), a phthalimido ester (Nefkens, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1961, 83, 1263), a pentachlorophenyl ester (Kupryszewski, Rocz. Chem., 1961, 35, 595), a pentafluorophenyl ester (Kovacs, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1963, 85, 183), an o-nitrophenyl ester (Bodanzsky, Nature, 1955, 175, 685), an imidazole ester (Li, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1970, 92, 7608), and a 3-hydroxy-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazoline (Dhbt-OH) ester (Konig, et al., Chem. Ber., 1973, 103, 2024 and 2034), or the initial formation of an anhydride such as a symmetrical anhydride (Wieland, et al., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl., 1971, 10, 336). Alternatively, the carboxyl group of the incoming amino acid can be reacted directly with the N-terminal of the last-coupled amino acid with the assistance of a condensation reagent such as, for example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (Sheehan, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1955, 77, 1067) or derivatives thereof. Benzotriazolyl N-oxy-trisdimethylaminophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), \u201cCastro's reagent\u201d (see, e.g., Rivaille, et al., Tetrahedron, 1980, 36, 3413) is recommended when assembling PNA molecules containing secondary amino groups. Finally, activated PNA monomers analogous to the recently-reported amino acid fluorides (Carpino, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1990, 112, 9651) hold considerable promise to be used in PNA synthesis as well., 77155=As can be seen in FIG. 1, the circular dichroism (CD) of PNA 10-mers of Example 1 are almost vanishingly small, indicating that there is no preferred helical stacking of bases. However, a strong CD spectrum arises upon titration of one 10-mer with the complementary 10-mer, a saturation obtained at about 1:1 stoichiometry, as shown in FIG. 2. The CD spectrum resembles that of B-DNA, indicating a right-handed helix. It is believed that a PNA-PNA complex having no preferred helicity initially is formed. The kinetics by which this double-stranded structure reorganizes into a uniform, right-handed double helix has been monitored and the activation parameters for the process determined., 280149=(1) Boc-deprotection with TFA/CH2Cl2 (1:1, v/v), 2.5 ml, 3\ufffd1 min and 1\ufffd30 min; (2) washing with CH2Cl2, 2.5 ml, 6\ufffd1 min; (3) neutralization with DIEA/CH2Cl2 (1: 19, v/v), 2.5 ml, 3\ufffd2 min; (4) washing with CH2Cl2, 2.5 ml, 6\ufffd1 min, and drain for 1 min; (5) 2-5 mg sample of PNA-resin is taken out and dried thoroughly for a quantitative ninhydrin analysis to determine the substitution; (6) addition of 0.47 mmol (0.25 g) BocA(Z)aeg-OH dissolved in 1.25 ml DMF followed by addition of 0.47 mmol (0.1 g) DCC in 1.25 ml CH2Cl2 or 0.36 mmol (0.20 g) BocTaeg-OPfp in 2.5 ml CH2Cl2; the coupling reaction was allowed to proceed for a total of 20-24 hrs shaking; (7) washing with DMF, 2.5 ml, 1\ufffd2 min; (8) washing with CH2Cl2, 2.5 ml, 4\ufffd1 min; (9) neutralization with DIEA/CH2Cl2 (1: 19, v/v), 2.5 ml, 2\ufffd2 min; (10) washing with CH2Cl2, 2.5 ml, 6\ufffd1 min; (11) 2-5 mg sample of protected PNA-resin is taken out and dried thoroughly for a quantitative ninhydrin analysis to determine the extent of coupling; (12) blocking of unreacted amino groups by acetylation with a 25 ml mixture of acetic anhydride/pyridine/CH2Cl2 (1:1:2, v/v/v) for 2 h (except after the last cycle); and (13) washing with CH2Cl2, 2.5 ml, 6\ufffd1 min; (14) 2\ufffd2-5 mg samples of protected PNA-resin are taken out, neutralized with DIEA/CH2Cl2 (1: 19, v/v) and washed with CH2Cl2 for ninhydrin analyses.}",
