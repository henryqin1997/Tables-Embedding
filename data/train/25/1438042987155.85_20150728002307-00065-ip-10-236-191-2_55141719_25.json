The single-season franchise record is five, set in 1984 and matched in 2005., 68351=Russell Wilson, who was sacked a career-high seven times, completed 10-of-18 passes for 139 yards for the NFC West-leading Seahawks (7-1), who have won three in a row since a loss to the Colts on Oct. 6., 69355=Defensive ends Robert Quinn and Chris Long each had three sacks for the home team. Quinn, who came into the game with seven sacks, is the first Rams player with 10 sacks in the first eight games of a season since Kevin Greene in 1988., 71673=St. Louis bridged the third and fourth frames with an 11-play, 69-yard drive that Zuerlein capped with a 27-yard field goal. A personal foul penalty and Chris Givens' 23-yard catch put the ball at the Seattle 40-yard line. On 3rd- and-16, the Rams got a fresh set of downs due to a defensive holding call. The home team moved the ball to the 3-yard line, but Clemens was sacked on third down. Zuerlein's field goal cut the gap to 14-9 with 12:51 left in the fourth., 67393=The Rams and veteran backup Kellen Clemens, who made his 13th career NFL start, started from their own 3-yard line with 5:42 to play. Clemens led St. Louis down to the Seattle 1-yard line. Rams running back Daryl Richardson was stopped on third down, and Clemens followed with an incomplete pass to Brian Quick as time expired., 70527=Another Clemens interception led to Seattle's first points of the game. Richard Sherman got the interception this time and returned the ball 38 yards to the St. Louis 26-yard line. Wilson's 17-yard run and a defensive pass interference call put the ball at the 1-yard line. After being stopped on consecutive running plays, Wilson hooked up with Tate for a 2-yard score. The touchdown made it 7-3 Seattle with 5:37 left in the second quarter.}",
