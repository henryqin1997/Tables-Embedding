    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Being fresh out of high school, I can say that it was hard to enjoy going to school everyday. I remember wanting to spend so much time on my school work and in some instances not being able to because of all the distractions and things. Now, I don't have to worry about that at all. From what I have experienced so far, my time in the classroom has been wonderful. The drama you deal with in high school is gone and its much easier to focus on your school work. Off campus, its a relaxed atmosphere, but all the while, you are working hard and enjoying working hard. Am learning a lot Most students take classes on the Gallatin campus. Right now, I am attending off campus sites at McGavock High School and Wilson Central High School for night class. I was skeptical at first of what I was missing out on at the main campus, but after my first semester, I found that I am learning a lot. The teachers are phenomenal, and because the classes are often smaller than they would be on campus during the day, I am able to develop a good relationship with both the teacher and the other students. I enjoy that because we are able to have more class discussion and learn",
