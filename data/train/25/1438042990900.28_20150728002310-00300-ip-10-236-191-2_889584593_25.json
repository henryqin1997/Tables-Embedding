The campus is beautiful, and probably nice weather all months except May, June, July, and August. Most of all, they seem to integrate their faith into the academics and truly care about their students., 126393=Go visit. The website is incredible for being laid out well with an attractive format and also making it easy to find what you are looking for, but there is nothing like seeing it in person, even if it is 100 degrees and in July like when I visited. After getting a campus tour, go walk around/drive around downtown Clinton, where the brick streets are. Visit the little shops if they are open (the coffee shop, bakery, antique stores, etc.) and most of the workers in the shops I visited were students at Mississippi College, so it was really cool to be able to talk to them and ask them about the college. If you can, go to Jackson as well. It's about 15-20 minutes away, and the admissions counselor told me students usually drive there for things like shopping and dining that Clinton doesn't offer. There isn't really a spot for this on the review, so I'll just put it here: a shout out to the admission staff, who went out of their way to let me visit after-hours so I had a private tour with one of the staff who stayed afterward and seemed extremely cool with it., 31121=MC has provided me with a perfect view of what it would be like to be a student of the college. The personalized campus visit I had on Friday, October 5 was well organized and everything was well accounted for. I especially commend their visit coordinator and MC Scouts for making my visit as enjoyable as possible., 84688=the food is very nasty this year (2013-2014)., 130276=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 30606=File for the FAFSA early January of your Senior year in high school to be sure the college can determine your finacial need; plus keep your grades up and take the ACT as many times as needed (Mississippi College takes your highest ACT score no matter how many times taken up to date of enrollment) to be considered for scholarships.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Hannah from Decatur, TX 12/05/2009 Reviewer is Researching this school. Reviewer has been to campus. 5 out of 5 people found this review useful. 2 of 36 Categories Comments Great for these types of students ones who prefer smaller classes and a better relationship with teachers and peers Tips for prospective students don't discount this school just because it is affiliated with the baptist denomination. it's very much a neutral christian environment. Will enjoy being here gorgeous campus with plenty of places (other than dorms) to study. everyone seems to have that southern hospitality that mississippi is notorious for. campus is very spacious, but compact enough that if you have classes on the other side of campus, a 5 minute walk (at most) is sufficient. also, mc has an on-campus infirmary inside the healthplex that is included into your tuition. that means, when you get sick and live quite a ways from home, you can visit here without having to venture off-campus Login",
