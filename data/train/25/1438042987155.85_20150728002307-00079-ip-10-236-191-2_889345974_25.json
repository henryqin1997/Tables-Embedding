    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The school isn't THAT small. There's always something to do there. It's a small community and you will get to know more people then if you were at a bigger college. Joining clubs will keep you busy as well if that's what you're looking for. Am learning a lot The fact that the class size is really small, gives the teacher more time to give out more information and pretty much call out each and every one of us to make sure we know whats going on. Sometimes you think you understand until you're asked; that's when you challenge yourself and find if you understand the material at hand. The subject doesn't matter. The professors there will learn your name and know your capacity pretty soon. If you need help. Help is everywhere! tutoring programs by subject are free.
