    "textAfterTable": "Configuring HSRP Virtual MAC Addresses or BIA MAC Addresses Note You cannot use the standby use-bia and standby mac-address commands in the same configuration; they are mutually exclusive. The standby use-bia command has the following disadvantages: When a router becomes active the virtual IP address is moved to a different MAC address. The newly active router sends a gratuitous ARP response, but not all host implementations handle the gratuitous ARP correctly. Proxy ARP does not function when the standby use-bia command is configured. A standby router cannot cover for the lost proxy ARP database of the failed router.
