Accordingly, it should be understood that the methods and apparatus described herein are illustrative only and are not limiting upon the scope of the invention. Although the forgoing text sets forth a detailed description of numerous different embodiments of the invention, it should be understood that the scope of the invention is defined by the words of the claims set forth at the end of this patent. The detailed description is to be construed as exemplary only and does not describe every possibly embodiment of the invention because describing every possible embodiment would be impractical, if not impossible. Numerous alternative embodiments could be implemented, using either current technology or technology developed after the filing date of this patent, which would still fall within the scope of the claims defining the invention. is an example of an inter-table dependency routine 800 which may be used to updated data item dependent upon a value from another table. At block 802, the routine 800 may receive a repeatable read hint from the application code which translates into the repeatable read lock hint to the server system 202. In the absence of a repeatable read hint, the shared lock is released immediately following the read operation at block",
