            "The campus is patrolled by three police departments. The University of Pittsburgh has a police department. The city of Pittsburgh's police department covers campus. Also, parts of campus are patrolled by the Carnegie Mellon Police Department. The campus generally feels safe. The Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh is an educational and cultural hub that is fun to live within. Students are up late at night and streets are well lit. The campus is in an urban setting, so using common sense is necessary. For example, there are certain locations that it may not be wise to visit late at night.",
            "About 9 percent of Pitt students participate in Greek life. There are both fraternities and sororities, however it is not a huge majority and is certainly not forced upon you. Greek life is present if you're interested.",
            "With a large school like Pitt, there are copious opportunities for clubs and activities. If Pitt doesn't offer something that you would like, you can always attempt to form a new club. Most students are fairly involved on campus.",
            "All types. There is no stereotype. However, a popular reasons to come here is to be a neuroscience student or other pre-med major. UPMC (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) provides great opportunities for these students.",
            "The Cathedral of Learning (42 stories, 535 feet tall, 2529 windows) is the largest academic building in the United States. The building is Pitt's landmark and provides wonderful views of campus from the Unversity Honors College on the 35th and 36th floors.",
            "As an in-state student, the cost was reasonable compared to some of my other out-of-state options. However, in comparison to other states and their state schools, Pitt is on the expensive side. Occasionally I feel that a class is not well taught, but overall the school is definitely worth it.",
            "Whatever you like to do for fun can be done at Pitt. Anything from arts events, to sporting events, to watching movies, to the common college party can be found. Living in the city of Pittsburgh allows for many opportunities. I personally enjoy exploring the city and cheering for all of my favorite Pittsburgh teams.",
            "As a member of our student government board's food committee, I have been able to experience the behind-the-scenes of our dining on campus. The staff of Sodexo and Pitt dining strive very hard to make sure every student enjoys what he or she eats on campus. You will only complain if you eat at the same place day in and day out. Eat at a variety of places and there is always something good to eat. Plus, living in the city provides a lot of additional off campus eating that is easily in walking distance.",
            "Wherever you live will be the best place to live on campus, according to you.",
            "Pitt is a major research university. Classes are offered at all different levels. If you are looking to be challenged, you certainly can find demanding classes.",
            "1. Don't allow all the Pitt has to offer overwhelm you. Pick a few activities that interest you and you will love the people, campus, and the city. 2. It is okay to not know what you want to major in when entering freshman year. 3. Visit professor's office hours. They enjoy meeting you and are always willing to help. 4. On a more humorous note, freshman are easily identifiable because the majority of them wear lanyards at the beginning of the school year.",
            "The University of Pittsburgh is a vibrant and happy place. Students enjoy what they do academically and also enjoy the city of Pittsburgh. The campus has not stereotype, and it is easy to fit in."

It might not be New York or L.A., but it's pretty close and has just about everything you'd expect from a city., 751244=Put yourself out there as much as you can in your first week. It's a big school and is easy to get lost in, so being involved can really make your experience 1000 times better., 415963=I feel very safe. Especially after the bomb threats during the Spring of 2012 semester., 270404=There's a lot of review in most below-1000-level classes if you've taken a course on it before (in high school, for example) but it's worth it and the teachers do build on it. Once you get to the upper levels it's mostly new knowledge., 170674=At the University of Pittsburgh, there is a large Arena called the Peterson Events Center, otherwise known as the Pete. There is a large field outside right outside there and every year, Univ. of Pittsburgh plans an event for Freshman students to break a world record of some sort. This past year of 2012, Univ. of Pittsburgh Class of 2016 broke the world record of the largest uniformed dance with umbrellas dancing to the Cupid Shuffle for 6 minutes. This field is also known by students to play Ultimate Frisbee, Croquet, Football, Volleyball, Tanning, etc., 526885=Definitely study, study, study. Join as many clubs as you can handle in high school. Keep your GPA above a 3.5, and aim for at least a 1200 on the math and reading section of the SAT, and you will be guaranteed entrance to the University., 1013494=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 601016=The Cathedral of Learning (42 stories, 535 feet tall, 2529 windows) is the largest academic building in the United States. The building is Pitt's landmark and provides wonderful views of campus from the Unversity Honors College on the 35th and 36th floors., 220278=If you're in-state, you're definitely getting a good deal. Pitt is just as good as private schools that charge twice as much. Obviously the out of state tuition is one of the highest in the country, but I still think it's a pretty decent deal. You get so many opportunities that small schools don't offer. The free bus pass alone retails for over $1600.}",

If you want to do anything in the medical field, Pitt offers a great Pre-Med curriculum, in addition to having 2 hospitals close by, which are affiliated with Pitt. Pitt also boasts strong social work and teaching programs. Tips for prospective students Apply early, and check out the guaranteed grad school section of the application page. You can get guaranteed admission to the medical, law, and pharmacy schools, if you qualify. Bang for the buck Pitt, though expensive, offers an incredible experience to those who make the most of it. The professors at Pitt are top notch, incredible researchers who can enrich typical classes with cutting edge findings from their own research. The dorms are of above average quality, and the food is",
