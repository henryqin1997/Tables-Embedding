His playing status was in question during the offseason, and an ankle surgery helped to delay his decision. However, he ultimately returned in mid-August, and Thursday passed for 171 yards and a touchdown on 15-of-27 completions, with one interception., 67437=New Orleans, LA (Sports Network) - Drew Brees threw for 237 yards and a score and Pierre Thomas ran for the decisive touchdown in the third quarter, as the Saints opened their title defense and the 2010 season with a 14-9 win over the Vikings., 70586=The Vikings, meanwhile, punted on their first two possessions before getting on the scoreboard with 5:28 left in the half. Minnesota started at its own 11- yard line and needed 16 plays and about 9 1/2 minutes to go 66 yards. That got the ball deep enough for Ryan Longwell to send a 41-yard field goal through the uprights., 67693=New Orleans captured its first championship seven months ago with a 31-17 win over the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV, and is looking to become the first repeat champion since New England in 2003 and 2004., 71874=But the Saints grabbed the lead back on their first drive of the second half. The 11-play, 74-yard march ended on two Thomas runs, the second a one-yard plunge across the goal line with 6:13 remaining.}",
