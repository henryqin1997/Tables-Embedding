Use the information in this article to determine whether your planned deployment falls within acceptable performance and capacity limits, and to appropriately configure limits in your environment., 55421=From the time that SharePoint Server 2010 requests a BLOB, until it receives the first byte from the NAS, no more than 20 milliseconds can pass., 28045=In SharePoint Server 2010, there are certain limits that are by design and cannot be exceeded, and other limits that are set to default values that may be changed by the farm administrator. There are also certain limits that are not represented by a configurable value, such as the number of site collections per Web application., 49293=For more information on SharePoint Server 2010 data size planning, see Storage and SQL Server capacity planning and configuration (SharePoint Server 2010)., 53152=The largest number of items per content database that has been tested on SharePoint Server 2010 is 60 million items, including documents and list items. If you plan to store more than 60 million items in SharePoint Server 2010, you must deploy multiple content databases., 26416=The test results and guidelines provided in this article apply to a single SharePoint Server 2010 farm. Adding servers to the installation might not increase the capacity limits of the objects that are listed in the tables in the Limits and boundaries section later in this topic. On the other hand, adding server computers increases the throughput of a server farm, which might be necessary to achieve acceptable performance with many objects. In some cases, the requirements for high numbers of objects in a solution might require more servers in the farm., 114184=The following table lists the recommended guidelines for instances of Visio Services in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010., 68325=SharePoint Server 2010 data is stored in SQL Server tables. To allow for the maximum number of possible columns in a SharePoint list, SharePoint Server will create several rows in the database when data will not fit on a single row. This is called row wrapping., 48191=The complexity of customizations and configurations on SharePoint Server 2010 may require refactoring (or splitting) of data into multiple content databases. Seek advice from a skilled professional architect and perform testing to determine the optimum content database size for your implementation. Examples of complexity may include custom code deployments, use of more than 20 columns in property promotion, or features listed as not to be used in the over 4 TB section below., 48016=It is strongly recommended to have proactive skilled administrator management of the SharePoint Server 2010 and SQL Server installations., 119286=Do not enable Web Analytics if your farm contains, or is expected to contain, more than 30,000 SharePoint entities, which include all Web applications, site collections, and sites. This number is not exact, because different combinations of SharePoint entities might have a greater or lesser effect on farm performance than the tested scenario, which is described in the article Capacity requirements for the Web Analytics Shared Service in SharePoint Server 2010. However, as the number of SharePoint entities in your farm closely approaches this limit, farm performance might fall to unacceptable levels., 48708=Refactoring of site collections allows for scale out of a SharePoint Server 2010 implementation across multiple content databases. This enables SharePoint Server 2010 implementations to scale indefinitely. This refactoring will be easier and faster when content databases are less than 200 GB., 83143=SharePoint Server 2010 enables you to add users or Active Directory groups to a SharePoint group., 38163=This section provides limits sorted by the logical hierarchy of a SharePoint Server 2010 farm., 21576=Topic Last Modified: 2013-07-09, 47678=Requirements for backup and restore may not be met by the native SharePoint Server 2010 backup for content databases larger than 200 GB. It is recommended to evaluate and test SharePoint Server 2010 backup and alternative backup solutions to determine the best solution for your specific environment., 55289=When SharePoint Server 2010 is configured to use RBS, and the BLOBs reside on NAS storage, consider the following boundary., 51163=SharePoint Server 2010 sites must be based on Document Center or Records Center site templates., 21499=Applies to: SharePoint Server 2010, 120076=For more information about boundaries and limits for the SharePoint Web Analytics service, see Capacity requirements for the Web Analytics Shared Service in SharePoint Server 2010., 21708=This article describes software boundaries and limits of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010. These include the following:, 137875=Project plans cannot extend past the date 12/31/2049., 31966=In SharePoint Server 2010, thresholds and supported limits are established through testing and observation of farm behavior under increasing loads up to the point where farm services and operations reach their effective operational limits. Some farm services and components can support a higher load than others so that in some cases you must assign a limit value based on an average of several factors., 128954=The following table lists the recommended guidelines for Microsoft SharePoint Workspace 2010., 120990=The following table lists the recommended guidelines for PerformancePoint Services in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010., 137096=The following table lists the recommended guidelines for Microsoft Project Server.
