            "You have to live in the dorms your first year with a random roommate. My brother loves his roommate and the dorms are so close to each other. They have rivalries and mascots and are know for hosting different events.",
            "It is a educational school -- they have fun stuff too, but there is more of a focus on what you are learning and how that will affect our future.",
            "My family has been part of the Notre Dame legacy for as long as I can remember. We go to the football games and my brother is attending there now. He is so happy with his choice and I am so excited to go there next fall."
