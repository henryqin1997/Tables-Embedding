If you attempt to ping a host in a different IP subnetwork, you must define a static route to the network or have IP\u00a0routing configured to route between those subnets. Executing Ping You can check the physical or operational status of an SFP module by using the show interfaces transceiver privileged EXEC command. This command shows the operational status, such as the temperature and the current for an SFP module on a specific interface and the alarm status. You can also use the command to check the speed and the duplex settings on an SFP module. Monitoring SFP Module Status Monitoring SFP Module Status If the module is identified as a Cisco SFP module, but the system is unable to read vendor-data information to verify its accuracy, an SFP module error message is generated. In this case, you should remove and reinsert the SFP module. If it continues",
