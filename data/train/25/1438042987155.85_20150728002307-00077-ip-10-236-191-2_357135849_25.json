In the following example (on a Cisco 2621 router), both the AAL5 SCC and the AAL2 SCC have been configured to 4 Mbps. Then an additional 7 Mbps are configured on the AAL5 SCC., 89313=For information about Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST), refer to the Survivable Remote Site Telephony Cisco 2600/3600 Voice Technical Marketing solutions document., 337466=Router(config-if)# ip address 172.10.10.0, 61757=You can configure the size of the tx ring for each permanent virtual circuit (PVC). The default value is 60. However, the value of the setting can be 1 through 60 on Cisco 1700 series routers and 3 through 60 on Cisco 2600 and Cisco 3600 series routers. A low tx ring setting, such as 2 or 3, is required for latency-critical traffic. For example, when the tx ring limit is configured as 3 and LLQ is configured on the PVC, the worst case delay for a voice packet is the time required to transmit three data packets. When the buffering is reduced by configuring the tx ring limit, the delay experienced by voice packets is reduced by a combination of the tx ring and LLQ mechanism., 396464=The following example from a Cisco 2621 network module shows that the clock rate on the AAL5 channel is set to the maximum value of 5.3 Mbps on interface ATM 1/0:, 73687=The maximum data rate between an SCC and a DSL WIC depends primarily on the maximum clock rate that the SCC can support. For example, on the Cisco 2600 series mainboard, which supports two DSL WICs, the total SCC clock rate that can be configured for both WICs is 8 Mbps. Therefore, if only one DSL WIC is present on the mainboard, AAL5 and AAL2 clock rates can be configured to 7 Mbps and 1 Mbps, respectively. If two DSL WICs are supported on the mainboard, the total of 8 Mbps should be distributed among the four SCCs., 949=This feature was introduced. The Cisco 1720 did not support voice., 323888=The following show command output is from a Cisco 1721 router. Use the show connection all or show connection id commands to check the state of the connection. Use show frame-relay pvc command to verify the state of the Frame Relay PVC and use show atm pvc commandto verify the state of the ATM PVC., 404420=The following example was configured on a Cisco 2600 router equipped with two xDSL WICs., 53762=When you configure the ip rtp header-compression command, the router adds the ip tcp header-compression command to the configuration by default. The ip tcp header-compression command is used to compress the TCP/IP packets of the headers. Header compression is particularly useful on networks that have a large percentage of small packets, such as those supporting many Telnet connections. The TCP header compression technique, described fully in RFC 1144, is supported on serial lines that use High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) or PPP encapsulation., 129542=To make full use of the 2.3 Mbps bandwidth for VoATM non-switched trunk calls on G.SHDSL, you can change the 1 Mbps default value on Cisco 2600 series and Cisco 3600 series routers and configure the AAL2 clock rate as 2.6 Mbps., 293522=The following show command output is from a Cisco 1721 router. Use the show connection all or show connection id commands to check the state of the connection. Use the show frame-relay pvc command to verify the state of the Frame Relay PVC, and use the show atm pvc command to verify the state of the ATM PVC., 22022=RFC 1483 Bridging, 60095=If a Cisco router terminates the PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) traffic, a computer connected to the Ethernet interface may have a problem accessing websites. The solution is to manually reduce the maximum transmission unit (MTU) configured on the computer by constraining the TCP maximum segment size (MSS). To manually reduce the MTU configured on the computer, use the ip tcp adjust-msscommand. The mss argument value must be 1452 or less., 129265=For Cisco 2600 and 3600 series routers, the minimum value for ADSL and G.SHDSL is 1 Mbps. The maximum value is 7 Mbps for mainboard slots and 5.3 Mbps for network modules. The default value for ADSL and G.SHDSL is 2.6 Mbps for both mainboard slots and network modules., 138368=The following show controllers atm example from a Cisco 2621 router shows verification of the SCC clock rates for ATM interface 0/0 on mainboard slot 0 and ATM interface 0/1 on mainboard slot 1:, 398975=The following output is from a Cisco 1721 router. This example shows how to create an FRF.5 one-to-one connection using the the connect command with the network-interworking keyword., 457599=RFC 1213, 1245=Support was added for Cisco 2610-2651, Cisco 3620, Cisco 3640, and Cisco 3660., 56218=Multilink PPP (MLP), standardized in RFC 1990, is similar to load-balancing techniques in that it sends packets across the individual links in a round-robin fashion. However, MLP adds three significant capabilities:, 142574=The system limitation for Cisco 2600 and Cisco 3600 series routers is that the total SCC clock rate that can be configured for one or more WICs is 8 Mbps. The following troubleshooting tips for Cisco 2600 and Cisco 3600 routers explain situations for which warning and error messages can be received because of the 8 Mbps limitation., 393517=The following output is from a Cisco 1721 router. In this example, all output packets that have an IP precedence value of 0 are sent with the CLP set to 1., 63523=For information about virtual circuit (VC) bundling, refer to Configuring an ADSL WAN Interface Card on Cisco 1700 Series Routers ., 217035=Specifies a maximum size in units of time for packet fragments on a MLP bundle. The delay-max argument is the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that it should take to transmit a fragment. The range is from 1 to 1000 milliseconds., 118952=The following is sample output using the show atm pvc command on a Cisco 1721 router that show detailed information about the PVC. In this example, five packets are sent, with the CLP set to 1., 410208=The following output is from a Cisco 2600 router that is configured for tx ring-limit tuning:, 439058=QoS features on Cisco 1700 series routers, 396193=The following example from a Cisco 2621 mainboard module shows that the clock rate on the AAL5 channel is set to the maximum value of 7 Mbps on interface ATM 0/0:, 340541=Specifies a maximum size in units of time for packet fragments on a MLP bundle. The delay-max argument is the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that it should take to transmit a fragment. The range is from 1 to 1000 milliseconds., 201005=Router(config-if-atm-vc)# vbr-rt 1500 1500, 52322=The Compressed Real-Time Protocol (cRTP) feature reduces bandwidth consumption on real-time applications such as voice. Thus, by using cRTP, you can further improve voice quality. Configuring cRTP can save troubleshooting time by isolating potential cRTP issues. Based on RFC 2508, the RTP header compression feature compresses the IP, User Data Protocol (UDP), and Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) header (IP/UDP/RTP header) from 40 bytes to 2 or 4 bytes, reducing unnecessary bandwidth consumption. RTP header compression is a hop-by-hop compression scheme; therefore, cRTP must be configured on both ends of the link (unless the passive option is configured)., 395677=The following example from a Cisco 1760 router shows that the clock rate on the AAL5 channel is set to the minimum value of 4 Mbps on interface ATM 0/0:, 409437=The following output is from a Cisco 1751 router. The tx ring limit is configured on an ATM PVC interface., 22319=RFC 1483 Routing, 74233=Network module SCCs also pose similar limitations. That is, on the Cisco 2600 series, the total clock rate for all four SCCs is 8 Mbps. The maximum AAL5 clock rate that may be configured on a network module is 5.3 Mbps. On the Cisco 1700 series, the maximum configurable SCC clock rate for both AAL5 and AAL2 is 8 Mbps., 441855=RFC 1483 bridging, 401363=The following output is from a Cisco 1721 router. This example shows how to create an FRF.8 connection using the the connect command with the service-interworking keyword., 1856=Enhanced voice and QoS features were added for Cisco 1720, Cisco 1721, Cisco 1751, Cisco 1760, Cisco 2610XM-2651XM, Cisco 3640, Cisco 3640A, and Cisco 3660., 135465=To verify the clock rate setting for an ADSL WIC or G.SHDSL WIC on a Cisco 1700, Cisco 2600, or Cisco 3600 series router, use the show running-config or the show controllers atmcommand in EXEC mode., 352099=The default value is 60. On Cisco 1700 series routers, possible values are 1 through 60. On Cisco 2600 and Cisco 3600 series routers, possible values are 3 through 60., 395938=The following example from a Cisco 1760 router shows that the clock rate on the AAL2 channel is set to the value of 5.3 Mbps on interface ATM 1/0:, 195074=Router(config-if)# ip address 172.100.10.10 255.255.255.0, 70033=For more information about analog voice interface support, refer to the Voice Port Testing Enhancements in Cisco 2600 and 3600 Series Routers and MC3810 Series Concentrators., 1553=Support was added for Cisco 1720, Cisco 1750, Cisco 1751, and Cisco 1760., 87177=For information about RFC 1483 bridging, refer to the following documents:, 84810=Refer to the Release Notes for the Cisco 1700 Series Routers for Cisco IOS Release 12.2(8)YN document for caveat information for multiple PVCs.}",
