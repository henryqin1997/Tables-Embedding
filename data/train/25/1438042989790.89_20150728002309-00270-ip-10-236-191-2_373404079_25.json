Support in a specific 12.2SX release of this train depends on your feature set, platform, and platform hardware. Usage Guidelines Normally, you do not issue the scrambling cell-payload command explicitly, because the default value is sufficient. On T1 links, the default b8zs line encoding normally assures sufficient reliability. The default for E1 is hdb3. The scrambling setting must match that of the far-end receiver. Examples On Cisco 7100 or 7200 series routers, the following example sets the link on interface 1 on the port adapter in slot 0 to no scrambling:  interface atm0/1 no scrambling cell-payload Related Commands Command Description scrambling-payload Improves data",
