In FIG. 14, the limit orders on the specialist's limit order display book include 1000 shares to sell at 32.02, 600 shares to sell at 32.01, 1000 shares to buy at 32.00 and 15,000 shares to buy at 31.95. The inside quote is:}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{134510=[0127] At step 1008, firm interest from floor traders and addition of that firm interest to the inside quote and liquidity quote, as illustrated in FIG. 9 occurs., 163144=[0156] In one alternative, the specialist trades 1000 shares at the inside bid of 32.00, and trades the other 19,000 shares at the liquidity bid of 31.95. The limit orders to buy 1500 shares at 31.99 get the advantage of price improvement and are traded at 31.95., 164065=[0159] In another example, illustrated in FIG. 17, the limit orders on the specialist's limit order display book include 1000 shares to sell at 32.02, 600 shares to sell at 32.01, 1000 shares to buy at 32.00, 1500 shares to buy at 31.99, and 15,000 shares to buy at 31.95., 163451=[0157] In another alternative, the specialist trades 20,000 shares at the liquidity bid of 31.95. The limit orders to buy 1000 shares at 32.00 and 1500 shares at 31.99 all get the advantage of price improvement and are traded at 31.95., 169363=[0162] The liquidity quote has met certain requirements, and therefore the liquidity quote is eligible for Institutional Express (\u201cIXP\u201d) order execution. Institutional Express orders are generally described in Member Firm Notification Institutional Express, Dec. 4, 2001, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 146282=[0144] If the liquidity quote prices are satisfactory, then at step 1320, only the updated inside quote is published., 176133=[0169] In another example, the specialist receives one electronic order designed for Express execution (IXP) to sell 15,000 shares at the inside bid price of 32.00 and another electronic order designated for Express execution (IXP) to sell 15,000 shares at the liquidity bid price of 31.95. Through an automated process, specialist trades 15,000 shares at the inside bid price of 32.00 and trades 15,000 shares at the liquidity bid price of 31.95. The limit orders to buy 1000 shares at 31.99 get the advantage of price improvement and are traded at 31.95., 139932=[0137] At step 1308, traders and investors enter firm electronic orders such as illustrated in steps 502, 504 of FIG. 5. These orders are generally limit orders., 136946=[0132] Once the size of the bid and offer of the liquidity quote are satisfactory, then at step 1016 the number of events since the last publication of the liquidity quote is compared to the bunching parameter. If the number of events has not reached the bunching parameter, then at step 1020, the updated inside quote is published, leaving the liquidity quote unchanged. Alternatively, if the number of events has reached the bunching parameter, then at step 1018, both the updated inside quote and the updated liquidity quote are published. The event counters are also reset when the liquidity quote is updated. The next trade is executed and the process then begins again at step 602., 134190=[0126] At step 1006, there is a determination of the cumulative size of limit orders between the inside quote price and the liquidity quote price on both the bid and offer side. These cumulative sizes are the minimum sizes that will be reflected in the liquidity quote., 145880=[0143] If the liquidity quote prices need to be reset, then at step 1316, system 1100 resets the prices. The technique used to reset the prices can be the same as the technique used at step 1304 to initially set the prices. The updated inside quote and the updated liquidity quote are then both updated and published at step 1322., 170177=[0164] In another example, illustrated in FIG. 18, the limit orders on the specialist's limit order display book include 1000 shares to sell at 32.02, 600 shares to sell at 32.01, 15,000 shares to buy at 32.00, 1000 shares to buy at 31.99, and 15,000 shares to buy at 31.95., 175688=[0168] In one example, the specialist receives an electronic order designed for Express execution (IXP) to sell 30,000 shares at the liquidity bid price of 31.95. Through an automated process, specialist trades 30,000 shares at the liquidity bid price of 31.95. The limit orders to buy 15,000 shares at 32.00 and 1000 shares at 31.99 all get the advantage of price improvement and are traded at 31.95., 139628=[0136] Once system 1100 or an individual sets the liquidity quote bid and offer prices, then at step 1306, the previous. trade is completed. The method begins a series of steps at step 1306 that repeat during the course of the trading day., 133068=[0124]FIG. 10 illustrates many of the steps in an embodiment of the invention. At the beginning of a trading day, at step 1002, the specialist sets the bunching parameters. Also at the beginning of a trading day, at step 1004, the specialist sets the bid and offer prices of the liquidity quote. Normally, the specialist sets the bunching parameters and the liquidity quote prices after opening the stock for trading. During the course of the trading day as the market moves, the specialist will adjust the bid and offer price of the liquidity quote, and may also adjust the bunching parameters., 157641=[0152] In another example, illustrated in FIG. 16, the limit orders on the specialist's limit order display book include 1000 shares to sell at 32.02, 600 shares to sell at 32.01, 1000 shares to buy at 32.00, 1500 shares to buy at 31.99, and 15,000 shares to buy at 31.95., 136408=[0131] Once the specialist is satisfied with the spread and size of the inside quote, then at steps 1010, 1012 the specialist determines whether the size of the bid and offer of the liquidity quote are satisfactory, and if additional size is required, then at step 1014 the specialist adds size at the bid or offer of the liquidity quote. The size that the specialist adds to the liquidity quote is the specialist's \u201cfirm interest\u201d reflected as part of the liquidity quote., 157347=[0151] The specialist receives a DOT order to sell 5000 shares at the market. The specialist trades 1000 shares at the inside bid of 32.00, 1500 shares at the limit order price of 31.99, and trades the other 2500 shares at the liquidity bid of 31.95., 138727=[0135] Referring now to FIG. 13 as an example of an embodiment of the instant invention with a floor-less auction market, at step 1304, system 1100 sets a liquidity bid price and a liquidity offer price, which together constitute a liquidity quote. Although an individual market maker may set the liquidity quote prices subjectively using experience, in system 1100 it is more common to automatically set the liquidity quote prices using predetermined price or percentage values that are tied to or based on the inside quote. For example, the liquidity quote can be simply a percent above and below the inside quote. For securities that experience significant market fluctuation, the percentage value can be greater than for securities that have lower fluctuation. The standard deviation of the prices is one measure of the fluctuation., 130036=[0121] Next, the specialist receives a market order to sell 4000 shares. The specialist exposes the order to the auction floor for price improvement, but there is none, and the specialist executes the trade against the remaining limit orders on the specialist's limit order display book. The 4000 share trade is executed against the buy limit orders on the book of 500 shares remaining at $85.88, up through the liquidity quote of $85.70. Some of the trade is executed against the firm interest that is reflected in the liquidity quote. This trade for 4000 shares causes the event counter on the bid side to increase by 4000 from 2000 to 6000, because the trade reduced the number of limit orders and firm interest to buy priced between the inside quote bid and the liquidity quote bid., 128564=[0118] The specialist receives a market order to sell 2000 shares. The specialist exposes the order to the auction floor for price improvement, but there is none, and the specialist executes the trade against the limit orders to buy on the specialist's limit order display book. The 2000 share trade is executed against the buy limit orders on the book of 200 shares at $85.99, 700 shares at $85.94, 700 shares at $85.91 and 400 shares at $85.88. This trade for 2000 shares causes the event counter on the bid side to increase by 2000 from 0 to 2000, because the trade reduced the number of limit orders to buy priced between the inside quote bid and the liquidity quote bid., 73841=[0051] The example below will describe a typical securities transaction on the NYSE. For a more detailed understanding of all of the rules and procedures of the NYSE, a person of ordinary skill would know to refer to New York Stock Exchange GUIDE, Commerce Clearing House (1984 with updates), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. First, investor 112 places an order with a NYSE Member Broker Firm 104 to buy or sell shares of an NYSE listed company. The NYSE Member Brokerage Firm checks the customer's account and enters order details. The member brokerage firm stores the order in its order match system, and then transmits the order to the NYSE trading floor 102, either computer to computer or in some cases by telephone., 169746=[0163] The specialist receives an electronic order designed for Express execution (IXP) to sell 20,000 shares at the liquidity bid price of 31.95. Through an automated process, the specialist trades 20,000 shares at the liquidity bid price of 31.95. The limit orders to buy 1000 shares at 32.00 and 1500 shares at 31.99 all get the advantage of price improvement and are traded at 31.95., 129643=[0120] Before any trades are executed, the specialist receives a cancel of the limit order to buy 1000 shares at $85.91. This order cancel causes the event counter on the bid side to increase by 1000 from 1000 to 2000 because the order cancel reduced the number of limit orders to buy priced between the inside quote bid and the liquidity quote bid., 152049=[0148] In another example, illustrated in FIG. 15, the limit orders on the specialist's limit order display book include 1000 shares to sell at 32.02, 600 shares to sell at 32.01, 1000 shares to buy at 32.00, 1500 shares to buy at 31.99, and 15,000 shares to buy at 31.95., 138059=[0134]FIG. 11 illustrates an embodiment of a system 1100 of the instant invention with a floor-less auction market. Broker dealers 104, institutional investors 106 and investors 108 have an electronic connection 110 that is used to send electronic orders and receive order confirmation and trade reports from floor-less auction market exchange 1102. Investors 112 forward their orders to exchange 1102 using electronic connection 114 with broker dealers 104. Although not illustrated, exchange 1102 may have connections to other exchanges or ECNs., 144693=[0142] At step 1314, system 100 determines whether the prices of the liquidity quote bid and offer need to be reset. Once system 1100 sets the liquidity quote bid and offer prices at the beginning of a trading day, the liquidity quote prices are generally not changed unless or until the inside quote moves significantly toward one of the liquidity quote values or the anonymous interest falls outside the liquidity quote bid and offer price and movement of the liquidity quote would capture that anonymous interest. As an example, if the liquidity quote bid is a certain percent below the inside quote bid, then the liquidity quote bid may be changed only when the inside quote bid moves one half of the price distance to the liquidity quote. (e.g., if the inside quote bid price is $85.99 and the liquidity quote bid price is $85.70, the liquidity quote bid price is not changed unless or until the inside quote price reaches $85.85, at which point the system sets a new liquidity quote bid price and a new liquidity quote offer price). Other tests for reset of the liquidity quote prices are clearly envisioned as well., 140158=[0138] At step 1310, traders and investors express their firm interest at prices between the liquidity quote prices and the inside quote prices. This expression of interest is a firm expression of interest at a price and size, but the firm interest is not identified to other traders or investors by price and size, or by the name of the trader expressing the firm interest. This technique is similar to the technique used in the PRIMEX TRADING system except that here the firm interest is outside the NBBO. System 1100 receives the firm expression of interest and includes that firm interest in the size that is reflected in the liquidity quote., 163730=[0158] In another alternative, the specialist trades 1000 shares at the inside bid of 32.00, 1500 shares at the limit price of 31.99 and trades the other 17,500 shares at the liquidity bid of 31.95. None of the limit orders on the specialist's limit order display book get price improvement., 151803=[0147] The specialist receives a DOT order to sell 5000 shares at the market. The specialist trades 1000 shares at the inside bid of 32.00 and trades the other 4000 shares at the liquidity bid of 31.95., 141650=[0140] At step 1312, system 1100 adds the cumulative size of limit orders to the firm interest to get the total number of firm bids and offers., 129283=[0119] Next, the specialist receives a limit order to buy 1000 shares at $85.91. This order to buy 1000 shares causes the event counter on the bid side to decrease by 1000 from 2000 to 1000 because the order increased the number of limit orders to buy priced between the inside quote bid and the liquidity quote bid.}",
