            "PU COMPOSITE AND METHOD OF FABRICATING THE SAME - A PU composite and a method of fabricating the same are provided. The fabrication method includes: (a) providing a release paper; (b) coating a fabric layer on the release paper, the fabric layer containing a PU resin, an abrasion resistant, and a colorant; (c) drying the fabric layer; (d) coating a first laminated layer on the fabric layer; (e) drying the first laminated layer; (f) laminating a wet PU foam layer on the first laminated layer; (g) releasing the release paper to form a semi-product; (h) providing a plastic layer, which is of a thermoplastic; (i) coating a second laminated layer on the plastic layer; (j) drying the second laminated layer; and (k) laminating the semi-product of Step (g) on the second laminated layer, so as to form a PU composite. Compared with conventional PU composites, the PU composite of the present invention has better UV resistance, solvent resistance, and abrasion resistance.",
            "COMPOSITE WITH THERMO-FORMABILITY, METHOD FOR MAKING THE SAME AND METHOD FOR MAKING A CASING WITH TEXTURE ON SURFACE THEREOF - The present invention relates to a composite with thermo-formability, a method for making the same and a method for making a casing with a texture on the surface thereof. The composite includes a PU medium layer, a thermo-formable resin layer, a base layer and a surface layer. The thermo-formable resin layer is disposed on the PU medium layer, and includes polyol. The base layer is disposed on the thermo-formable resin layer. The surface layer is disposed on the base layer. As a result, the composite has good stability after thermoforming, and plastic can be injected into the composite, so a PC film is unnecessary. Moreover, the composite may be adhered to a substrate directly or after thermoforming.",

            "STRUCTURE WITH LUMINOUS AND VISUAL EFFECTS AND LIGHT TRANSMISSIVE SHEET THEREOF AND METHOD FOR MAKING THE SAME - The present invention relates to a structure with luminous and visual effects, a light transmissive sheet thereof, and a method for making the same. The light transmissive sheet includes a first layer, a light transmissive intermediate layer and a second layer. The material of the first layer, the light transmissive intermediate layer and the second layer is polyurethane resin. The light transmissive intermediate layer is disposed on the first layer, and the second layer is disposed on the light transmissive intermediate layer. At least one pattern is formed on the first layer or the second layer, and the pattern penetrates the first layer or the second layer. When light irradiates the light transmissive sheet, the pattern is shown, so the light transmissive sheet has luminous and visual effects."

The base includes a shaft tube having an open end and receiving an inner assembly. The stator is mounted to an outer periphery of the shaft tube. The rotor is rotatably coupled to the inner assembly. The stator includes an insulating bobbin unit having an extension extending in a radial direction to the open end of the shaft tube. The extension includes an engagement hole. The shaft tube includes a positioning member having an engaging section engaged in the engagement hole. The insulating bobbin unit is fixed by an end of the engaging section. The engagement stability of the stator is enhanced by engagement of the positioning member of the base and the insulating bobbin unit. 20130285495 01-10-2013 Fan - A fan includes a housing and a motor. The housing has a compartment, at least one lateral air inlet and at least one lateral air outlet. The lateral air inlet and lateral air outlet communicate with the compartment. The motor has a stator and an impeller. The impeller is coupled with the stator and includes a hub and a plurality of blades coupled with a top face of the hub. Each blade has first and second ends. The first ends of the blades face outwards, and the second ends of the blades define an air-guiding room encompassed by a virtual geometric pattern formed by a virtual",

A light source of one particular color inside a first group of light sources and a light source of a different color (or the same color) inside a second group of light source are lit to scan the front and back surface of a scan document. Optical signals from the front and back surface of the scan document are received and converted into analogue electrical signals. Thereafter, the analogue electrical signals are converted into digital electrical signal. Finally, the digital electrical signals are output to a host computer. This invention utilizes two groups of light sources (for example, light-emitting diodes) to serve as light sources for the double-sided scanner. Because light-emitting diodes require no warm-up period and is quick to switch, double-sided scanning is simplified. 06-11-2009 20100214631 METHOD OF SEQUENCING IMAGE DATA INSIDE MEMORY OF OPTICAL SCANNING DEVICE - An image data sequencing method for a memory unit inside an optical scanning device. The image data sequencing method is particularly suitable for scanning a line of pixels with each pixel comprising a plurality of primary colors. The image data sequencing method involves scanning a line of pixels to obtain the data for a primary or secondary color. The pixels within the scan line are subdivided into groups.
