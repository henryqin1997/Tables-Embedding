    "textBeforeTable": "The Volunteers have lost eight of their last nine road games versus Top 25 foes. They hold a 70-52 edge in this all-time series. Tennessee has dropped consecutive games in Gainesville but more than held its own in its most recent visit, losing 61-60 to then-No. 17 Florida last Feb. 12 on Erving's driving layup with 14 seconds left. \"We did a good job really shooting the ball around the perimeter,\" said coach Cuonzo Martin, whose team improved to 8-2 when making at least eight 3s. \" ... You've got a chance to win a lot of ball games when you play that way.\" Tennessee was 10 of 20 from 3-point range and shot 50.0 percent from the floor, the first time it reached that mark since the win over Florida (51.0). \"Little bit of the nerves were gone, but, like I said, it's not about starting or finishing, it's about our five guys working as a unit when we're out there, no matter whether those minutes come early or late,\" McBee said. Tennessee most recently defeated South Carolina 69-57 on Wednesday behind a career-high 18 points from Skylar McBee. The junior guard, averaging 6.7 points, made 4 of 7 from beyond the arc in his second consecutive start after coming off the bench for his first 86 games with the Vols. They enter this matchup winners",
