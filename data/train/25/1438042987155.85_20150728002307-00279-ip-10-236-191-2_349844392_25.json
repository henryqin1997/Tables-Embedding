Always remembet to set oiExcel.interpretClarionColorEquates!\u00a0It is recommended that you store your own palette and use the functions provided below to manage the colors in the palette. This creates a \"palette\", which is an array of longs and is used to store the colors used, and the functions to get/set the colors ensure that the Excel palette remains sychronised. In versions of Excel prior to Excel 2007 this was limited to 40 colors (which is handled in the docs below)., 118749=long fileType (optional): A value that determines the type of file saved. This can be used to override the default Excel file type. For example in Excel 2007 the default file type is .XLSX, which cannot be opened by previous versions of Excel. This can be used to save as a standard XLS file, which is compatible with Excel 97, 2000, XP and 2003. The below table shows a list of all possible values, and the equates provided for the values, as well as a description of the file type., 50803=Returns a string that contains the Excel name of a column when passed the number of the column. Excel names columns alphabetically. The first column is A, the second B and so on. After the 26th column (Z), two characters are used to present the column. Column 27 is AA, 28 is AB and so on. This method actually returns the characters used for any column up to 450,000. Version of Excel prior to Excel 2007 only supported 255 columns (so the final column was named IV). In Excel 2007 this limit has been increased to 16K., 126666=Excel 2007 has a new default file type which is .XLSX. This format cannot be opened by previous versions of Excel. The fileFormat parameter can be used to save as a standard XLS file, which is compatible with Excel 97, 2000, XP and 2003 by passing oix:xlWorkbookNormal. Use oix:xlWorkbookDefault to allow Excel to save in the default format specified, which in Excel 2007 is always the new XLSX. The changes made to Excel 2007 result in unexpected behaviour if you assume a certain format when saving. If the incorrect file extension is specified the file will be saved in the default, or the specified format, but when opened it will display an error warning the user that the file extension is incorrect and that the file may be dangerous. If you choose to save the document as an Excel 97-2003 compatible XLS document by setting the fileFormat parameter to oix:xlWorkbookNormal, then depending on the content of the document Excel may display a compatiblity warning dialog box (which may or may not be displayed in front of your application)., 190108=This callback method is called for each row (record) when importing a file from Excel using the ExcelImport method. This allows each row to be processed. The queue contains the value of each cell in the row. The maximum length of the data for any cell is 1024 characters.

The new method removes the limitation of 26 columns and supports up to 450,000 columns (Excel 2007 removes the 255 column limit of previous version and supports 65535 columns).
