    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{67976=The use of NAPRELAN\u00ae\u00a0Tablets for the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis was assessed in a 12 week double-blind, randomized, placebo and active-controlled study in 348 patients. Two NAPRELAN\u00ae\u00a0500 mg tablets (1000 mg) once daily and naproxen 500 mg tablets twice daily (1000 mg) were more effective than placebo. Clinical effectiveness was demonstrated at one week and continued for the duration of the study., 22940=Significant naproxen overdosage may be characterized by drowsiness, heartburn, indigestion, nausea or vomiting. Because naproxen sodium may be rapidly absorbed, high and early blood levels should be anticipated. A few patients have experienced seizures, but it is not clear whether or not these were drug-related. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life threatening. The oral LD50 of the drug is 500 mg/kg in rats, 1200 mg/kg in mice, 4000 mg/kg in hamsters and greater than 1000 mg/kg in dogs. In animals 0.5 g/kg of activated charcoal was effective in reducing plasma levels of naproxen., 20667=The recommended starting dose of NAPRELAN\u00ae Tablets in adults is two NAPRELAN\u00ae 375 mg tablets (750 mg) once daily, one NAPRELAN\u00ae 750 mg (750 mg) once daily, or two NAPRELAN\u00ae 500 mg tablets (1000 mg) once a daily. Patients already taking naproxen 250 mg, 375 mg, or 500\u00a0mg twice daily (morning and evening) may have their total daily dose replaced with NAPRELAN\u00ae Tablets as a single daily dose., 18223=The recommended starting dose is two NAPRELAN\u00ae 500 mg tablets (1000 mg) once daily. For patients requiring greater analgesic benefit, two NAPRELAN\u00ae 750 mg tablets (1500 mg) or three NAPRELAN\u00ae 500 mg tablets (1500 mg) may be used for a limited period. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed two NAPRELAN\u00ae 500 mg tablets (1000 mg).\u00a0, 7666=These are not all the side effects with NSAID medicines. Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist for more information about NSAID medicines.\u00a0Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088., 20105=During long-term administration, the dose of NAPRELAN\u00ae Tablets may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. In patients who tolerate lower doses of NAPRELAN\u00ae Tablets well, the dose may be increased to two NAPRELAN\u00ae 750 mg tablets (1500 mg), or three NAPRELAN\u00ae 500 mg tablets (1500 mg) once daily for limited periods when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating patients, especially at the higher dose levels, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefit to offset the potential increased risk (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The lowest effective dose should be sought and used in every patient. Symptomatic improvement in arthritis usually begins within one week; however, treatment for two weeks may be required to achieve a therapeutic benefit., 65594=In a double-blind randomized, parallel group study, 19 subjects received either two NAPRELAN\u00ae\u00a0500 mg tablets (1000 mg) once daily or naproxen 500 mg tablets (1000 mg) twice daily for 7 days. Mucosal biopsy scores and endoscopic scores were lower in the subjects who received NAPRELAN\u00ae\u00a0Tablets. In another double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 23 subjects received two NAPRELAN\u00ae\u00a0500 mg tablets (1000 mg) once daily, naproxen 500 mg tablets (1000 mg) twice daily and aspirin 650 mg four times daily (2600 mg) for 7 days each. There were significantly fewer duodenal erosions seen with NAPRELAN\u00ae\u00a0Tablets than with either naproxen or aspirin. There were significantly fewer gastric erosions with both NAPRELAN\u00ae\u00a0Tablets and naproxen than with aspirin. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown., 17447=The recommended dose on the first day is two to three NAPRELAN\u00ae 500 mg tablets (1000 - 1500 mg) once daily, followed by two NAPRELAN\u00ae 500 mg tablets (1000 mg) once daily, until the attack has subsided., 67262=The use of NAPRELAN\u00ae\u00a0Tablets for the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee was assessed in a 12 week double-blind, placebo and active-controlled study in 347 patients. Two NAPRELAN\u00ae\u00a0500 mg tablets (1000 mg) once daily and naproxen 500 mg tablets twice daily (1000 mg) were more effective than placebo. Clinical effectiveness was demonstrated at one week and continued for the duration of the study., 14652=NAP-PI\u00a0-2 Rev 03/2013, 2487=NAP-MG-2 Rev 03/2013}",
