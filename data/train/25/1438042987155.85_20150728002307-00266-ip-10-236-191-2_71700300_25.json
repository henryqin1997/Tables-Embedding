Failures with critical priority require immediate attention because they make the whole database unavailable. Typically, critical failures bring down the instance and are diagnosed during the subsequent startup. The database is not available until all critical failures are fixed (see ADVISE FAILURE). Failures with HIGH priority make a database partially unavailable or unrecoverable, and usually have to be repaired in a reasonably short time. Examples of such failures include physical data block corruptions, nonfatal I/O errors, missing archived redo log files or backup files, and so on. Failures with LOW priority can be ignored until more important failures are fixed. For example, a block corruption will be initially assigned a high priority, but if this block is not important for the database availability, you can use CHANGE FAILURE to change the priority to LOW.",
