            "SYSTEM FOR PERSONAL AUTHORIZATION CONTROL FOR CARD TRANSACTIONS - An authorization system allows for cardholder-provided parameters to a personal authorization subsystem. The parameters can be selected by the cardholder to limit the authorizations that would otherwise be granted on the card. The parameters can indicate limits by frequency, dollar amount, merchant, geographic location, time of day, combinations thereof, or the like. Authorization for a given transaction, even where authorized by an issuer and a network operator, might be denied based on self-constraints set by the cardholder. In some variations, messages are sent to the cardholder based on constraints set by the cardholder and transactions might be approved and messaged, or denied and messaged.",

A bill payment request is received from an operator of an on-line banking bill payment web site. The operator may be a bank. The request is for payment of a bill using a portable consumer device. A transaction request is then generated for an issuer and sent to the issuer for authorization. The issuer then sends a response indicating whether the transaction request is approved or declined. Remittance information for a biller is generated if the transaction is approved. The remittance information is then forwarded to the operator of the on-line banking bill payment web site for forwarding to a user of the portable consumer device. Additionally, the remittance information is sent to an acquirer or cash management bank, which can forward the information to the biller associated with the bill payment request. 10-20-2011 Mark Stephen Kemper, Adrian, MI US Patent application number Description Published 20100280664",
