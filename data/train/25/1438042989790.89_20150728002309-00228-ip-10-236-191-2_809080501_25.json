The context is either format (the default), the form used within a date format string (such as \"Saturday, November 12th\", or stand-alone, the form used independently, such as in Calendar headers. The width can be wide (the default), abbreviated, or narrow. The latter is the shortest possible width: it is typically used in calendar headers. The values in formats must be distinct; that is, \"S\" could not be used both for Saturday and for Sunday. The same is not true for stand-alone values; they might only be distinguished by context, especially in the narrow format., 186788=Values calculated for the Week of Year field range from 1 to 53. Week 1 for a year is the first week that contains at least the specified minimum number of days from that year. Weeks between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (if needed). For example, January 1, 1998 was a Thursday. If the first day of the week is MONDAY and the minimum days in a week is 4 (these are the values reflecting ISO 8601 and many national standards), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends on January 4, 1998. However, if the first day of the week is SUNDAY, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and ends on January 10, 1998. The first three days of 1998 are then part of week 53 of 1997., 234816=<ldml version=\"1.1\" validSubLocales=\"de_AT de_CH de_DE\"> \u00a0<identity> \u00a0 <version number=\"1.1\" /> \u00a0 <generation date=\"2004-06-04\" /> \u00a0 <language type=\"de\" /> \u00a0</identity> ... </ldml>, 212951=Patterns support rounding to a specific increment. For example, 1230 rounded to the nearest 50 is 1250. Mathematically, rounding to specific increments is performed by multiplying by the increment, rounding to an integer, then dividing by the increment. To take a more bizarre example, 1.234 rounded to the nearest 0.65 is 1.3, as follows:, 11353=Locale data is not cast in stone: the data used on someone's machine generally may reflect the US format, for example, but preferences can typically set to override particular items, such as setting the date format for 2002.03.15, or using metric vs. Imperial measurement units. In the abstract, locales are simply one of many sets of preferences that, say, a website may want to remember for a particular user. Depending on the application, it may want to also remember the user's timezone, preferred currency, preferred character set, smoker/non-smoker preference, meal preference (vegetarian, kosher, etc.), music preference, religion, party affiliation, favorite charity, etc., 83980=\"During the period commencing at 2 o'clock antemeridian on the first Sunday of April of each year and ending at 2 o'clock antemeridian on the last Sunday of October of each year, the standard time of each zone established by sections 261 to 264 of this title, as modified by section 265 of this title, shall be advanced one hour...\" (United States Law - 15 U.S.C. \u00a76(IX)(260-7))., 231663=<ldml version=\"1.1\" draft=\"true\"> \u00a0<identity> \u00a0 <version number=\"1.1\" /> \u00a0 <generation date=\"2004-06-04\" /> \u00a0 <language type=\"af\" /> \u00a0</identity> \u00a0<characters draft=\"false\"/> \u00a0<localeDisplayNames/> \u00a0<dates/> \u00a0<numbers/> \u00a0<collations/> </ldml>, 307171=Copyright \u00a9 2001-2004 Unicode, Inc.

The mantissa is typically in the half-open interval [1.0, 10.0) or sometimes [0.0, 1.0), but it need not be. In a pattern, the exponent character immediately followed by one or more digit characters indicates scientific notation. Example: \"0.###E0\" formats the number 1234 as \"1.234E3\"., 234113=<ldml version=\"1.1\"> \u00a0<identity> \u00a0 <version number=\"1.1\" /> \u00a0 <generation date=\"2004-06-04\" /> \u00a0 <language type=\"de\" /> \u00a0 <territory type=\"AT\" /> \u00a0</identity> </ldml>, 188945=The NumberElements resource affects how these patterns are interpreted in a localized context. Here are some examples, based on the French locale. The \".\" shows where the decimal point should go. The \",\" shows where the thousands separator should go. A \"0\" indicates zero-padding: if the number is too short, a zero (in the locale's numeric set) will go there. A \"#\" indicates no padding: if the number is too short, nothing goes there. A \"\u00a4\" shows where the currency sign will go. The following illustrates the effects of different patterns for the French locale, with the number \"1234.567\". Notice how the pattern characters ',' and '.' are replaced by the characters appropriate for the locale., 78835=The weekendStart time defaults to \"00:00:00\" (midnight at the start of the day). The weekendEnd time defaults to \"24:00:00\" (midnight at the end of the day). (That is, Friday at 24:00:00 is the same time as Saturday at 00:00:00.) Thus the following are equivalent:, 41765=This attribute should only be present if draft=\"true\". It indicates that the data is proposed replacement data that has been added provisionally until the differences between it and the other data can be vetted. For example, suppose that the translation for September for some language is \"Settembru\", and a bug report is filed that that should be \"Settembro\". The new data can be entered in, but marked as alt until it is vetted., 230923=<ldml version=\"1.1\" draft=\"true\"> \u00a0<identity> \u00a0 <version number=\"1.1\" /> \u00a0 <generation date=\"2004-06-04\" /> \u00a0 <language type=\"af\" /> \u00a0</identity> </ldml>, 211005=Patterns support padding the result to a specific width. In a pattern the pad escape character, followed by a single pad character, causes padding to be parsed and formatted. The pad escape character is '*'. For example, \"$*x#,##0.00\" formats 123 to \"$xx123.00\", and 1234 to \"$1,234.00\".}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The field values are given in the following table. All field values are case-insensitive, except for the type, which is case-sensitive. However, customarily the language code is lowercase, the territory and variant codes are uppercase, and the script code is titlecase (that is, first character uppercase and other characters lowercase). The type may also be referred to as a key-value, for clarity. The latest draft for that successor is http://www.inter-locale.com/ID/draft-phillips-langtags-05.html. The latest draft of the registry corresponding to that draft is at http://users.adelphia.net/~dewell/lstreg.txt. Note: The successor to RFC 3066 is being currently developed.
