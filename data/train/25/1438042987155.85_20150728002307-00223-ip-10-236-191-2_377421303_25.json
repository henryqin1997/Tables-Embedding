    "textAfterTable": "Cisco ITS 2.0 This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(8)T. Usage Guidelines The name argument is used to provide caller ID for calls originating from a directory number in Cisco Unified CME and also generates local directory information that is accessed by using the Directories button on a Cisco IP phone. The name argument combination must match the order specified in the directory (telephony-service) command, either first-name-first or last-name-first. The name string must contain a space between the first and second parts of the string (first last or last first). The name string cannot contain special characters such as an ampersand (&). The only special characters supported in the name string are the comma (,) and the percent sign (%). To display a comma between the last and first names when the pattern is last-name-first, add a comma (,) to the end of the first part of the name string (last name), for example: last, first. The second part of the name string can contain spaces, such as \u201cand Handling.\u201d Examples The following example configures the username John Smith with the pattern first-name-first:",
