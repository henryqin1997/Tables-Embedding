The rule is effective through December 31, 2011., 80793=The RFA requires each Federal agency, during April and October of each year, to publish in the Federal Register an agenda identifying rules that the agency expects to consider in the next 12 months that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (5 U.S.C. 602(a)). The RFA specifically provides that publication of the agenda does not preclude an agency from considering or acting on any matter not included in the agenda and that an agency is not required to consider or act on any matter that is included in the agenda (5 U.S.C. 602(d)). Actions that do not have an estimated date are placed in the long-term category; the Commission may nevertheless act on items in that category within the next 12 months. The agenda includes new entries, entries carried over from prior publications, and rulemaking actions that have been completed (or withdrawn) since publication of the last agenda., 93709=Abstract: The Commission adopted amendments in December 2009 to enhance proxy disclosures. In the proposing release for those rules, the Commission also proposed further amendments to its proxy rules to clarify the manner in which they operate and address issues that have arisen in the proxy solicitation process. The Division is considering recommending that the Commission repropose amendments in this area., 113585=Abstract: The Commission adopted interim final rules, providing exemptions under the Securities Act, Exchange Act, and Trust Indenture Act for those security-based swaps that under current law are security-based swap agreements and will be defined as \u201csecurities\u201d under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act as of July 16, 2011, due solely to the provisions of title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act., 51923=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 148098=Abstract: Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commission to remove any references to credit ratings from its regulations and to substitute such standards of creditworthiness as the Commission determines to be appropriate. The Commission proposed to amend certain rules and one form under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) applicable to broker-dealer financial responsibility, distributions of securities, and confirmations of transactions. The Commission also requested comment on potential standards of creditworthiness for purposes of Exchange Act sections 3(a)(41) and 3(a)(53), which define the terms \u201cmortgage related security\u201d and \u201csmall business related security,\u201d respectively, as the Commission considers how to implement section 939(e) of the Dodd-Frank Act., 173163=The Commission is withdrawing this item from the Unified Agenda because it does not expect to consider this item within the next 12 months, but the Commission may consider the item at a future date, pending the outcome of additional NRSRO rules proposed in May 2011 (RIN 3235-AL15) to implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act., 103305=Abstract: The Commission proposed amendments to forms and rules to implement the requirements of section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed amendments would require any reporting issuer for which conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by that issuer to disclose in its annual report whether its conflict minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. If so, the issuer would be required to furnish a separate report which is audited by an independent private sector auditor, as an exhibit to the annual report that includes, among other matters, a description of the measures taken by the issuer to exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of its conflict minerals., 82373=\u201cExchange Act\u201d\u2014 Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 52562=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 4, 2015, 82289=\u201cSecurities Act\u201d\u2014 Securities Act of 1933, 106172=Legal Authority: 15 U.S.C. 78q; Pub.
