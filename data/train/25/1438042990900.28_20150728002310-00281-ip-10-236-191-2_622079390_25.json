Therefore, it is still manufactured in 40nm at TSMC., 11140=Due to similar clock speeds, the GeForce GTX 675M is as fast as the old\u00a0GTX 580M\u00a0and is this noticeably more powerful than the\u00a0GTX 670M\u00a0and\u00a0AMD Radeon HD 6970M. Current games as of 2011 should therefore run fluently in Full HD resolution and maximum details. Only a few very demanding games, such as Metro 2033, may need slightly reduced graphical settings for smoother gameplay.}",
