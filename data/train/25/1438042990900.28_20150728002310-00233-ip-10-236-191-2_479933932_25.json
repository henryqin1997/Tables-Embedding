SNMP layer 62 is used to support network management functions. For more information on SNMP layer 62 see RFC-1157 incorporated herein by reference. TFTP layer 64 is a file transfer protocol used to download files and configuration information. For more information on TFTP layer 64 see RFC-1350 incorporated herein by reference. DHCP layer 66 is a protocol for passing configuration information to hosts on an IP 54 network. For more information on DHCP layer 66 see RFC-1541 incorporated herein by reference. UDP manager 68 distinguishes and routes packets to an appropriate service (e.g., a virtual tunnel). More or few protocol layers could also be used with data-over-cable system 10., 284129=FIG. 23 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 394 for checking validity of a cable modem registration request message. At step 398, CMTS 12 receives a registration request message from CM 16 created with methods 336, 352 and/or 368. At step 400, CMTS 12 determines if the first message is authentic by checking a first message integrity check value (e.g., CMTS-MIC value) in the registration request message. CMTS 12 calculates a second message integrity check value (e.g., MD5 value) on fields in the registration request message in a pre-determined order (Table 26) and compares it to the first message integrity check value. If the first and second message integrity check values are the same, at step 400 the CMTS 12 determines if the registration request message was sent within a predetermined time limit (e.g., 1 second) by comparing a selected time-value (Table 12) in the registration request message to a current time-value in CMTS 12. As was described above, the selected time-value is a time value indicating an approximate time when the registration message was sent based on the number of seconds since time 00:00 on Jan. 1, 1970. If the registration request message was not sent within a pre-determined time limit (e.g., 1 second), the registration request message is discarded at step 402. In addition, if the registration request message was not authentic (step 398), it is also discarded at step 402 and steps 404 and 406 are executed., 104295=After receiving TCD 70 message and TSI message 76, CM 16 continues to establish access to data network 28 (and resources on the network) by first dialing into TRAC 24 and establishing a telephony PPP 50 session. Upon the completion of a successful PPP 50 connection, CM 16 performs PPP Link Control Protocol (\u201cLCP\u201d) negotiation with TRAC 24. Once LCP negotiation is complete, CM 16 requests Internet Protocol Control Protocol (\u201cIPCP\u201d) address negotiation. For more information on IPCP see RFC-1332 incorporated herein by reference. During IPCP negotiation, CM 16 negotiates an IP 54 address with TRAC 24 for sending IP 54 data packet responses back to data network 28 via TRAC 24., 115249=FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a DHCP 66 message structure 108. The format of DHCP 66 messages is based on the format of BOOTstrap Protocol (\u201cBOOTP\u201d) messages described in RFC-951 and RFC-1542 incorporated herein by reference. From a network host client's point of view, DHCP 66 is an extension of the BOOTP mechanism. This behavior allows existing BOOTP clients to interoperate with DHCP 66 servers without requiring any change to network host the clients' BOOTP initialization software. DHCP 66 provides persistent storage of network parameters for network host clients., 67598=Above modem interface 48 in data link layer 42 is Point-to-Point Protocol (\u201cPPP\u201d) layer 50, hereinafter PPP 50. As is known in the art, PPP is used to encapsulate network layer datagrams over a serial communications link. For more information on PPP see Internet Engineering Task Force (\u201cIETF\u201d) Request for Comments (\u201cRFC\u201d), RFC-1661, RFC-1662 and RFC-1663 incorporated herein by reference. Information for IETF RFCs can be found on the World Wide Web at URLs \u201cds.internic.net\u201d or \u201cwww.ietf.org.\u201d, 245683=The selected time value is used as defined in RFC-868; incorporated herein by reference. However, the selected time-value is the number of seconds since time 00:00 on Jan. 1, 1970 (i.e., UNIX epoch time) instead of the number of seconds since time 00:00 on Jan. 1, 1900. However, other time values and formats could also be used (e.g., seconds since boot time, or a common network clock time).}",
