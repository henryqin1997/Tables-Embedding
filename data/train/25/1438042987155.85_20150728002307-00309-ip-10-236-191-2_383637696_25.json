Usage Guidelines The authentication string is sent unencrypted in all HSRP messages. The same authentication string must be configured on all routers and access servers on a LAN to ensure interoperation. Authentication mismatch prevents a device from learning the designated Hot Standby IP address and the Hot Standby timer values from other routers configured with HSRP.
