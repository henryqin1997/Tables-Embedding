Note that some monthly gap still remains: our ability to adjust monthly transactions is still incomplete as we cannot account for unrecorded acquisitions that are placed with other domestic custodians. However, compared to the original Bertaut-Tryon foreign official series, the recorded \"gap\" on the survey date is notably smaller: for June 2006, for example, we reduce the gap for official holdings of Treasuries from $130 billion to $22 billion, and for long-term agencies from $149 billion to $81 billion. We include a file (ticdata.liabilities.foiadj.csv) of the new underlying monthly estimates of total foreign official holdings of long-term Treasuries, Agencies, corporate bonds, and equities, the adjusted monthly net flows in each of these security types, monthly estimated valuation changes, and the residual monthly gaps, for December 1984 through the most recent annual survey (June 2010). These adjusted estimates of foreign official holdings form the basis of our measures of foreign holdings of Treasuries and Agencies in our regression models., 83708=Caballero, Ricardo, Emmanuel Farhi, and Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas (2009), \"Financial Crash, Commodity Prices, and Global Imbalances,\" Working paper, November., 60989=Once the parameters of the model are set, global demand can then be expressed as the averages of demands for the individual assets in each country, weighted by the shares of each country's wealth in global wealth. In equilibrium, the global demand for each asset must equal the fixed asset supply. We set initial stocks of assets and levels of country wealth to be roughly comparable to levels of bank deposits held in Europe and the United States, Treasury (and Agency) securities held by the public, and U.S. corporate debt outstanding in 2003. In our simplified version, corporate debt, including ABS, is held exclusively by the United States and Europe., 111190=To adjust monthly net purchases of long-term Treasuries and Agencies, we compare the monthly changes in the (confidential) information on custody holdings of long-term Treasuries and agencies for selected official investors at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with transactions in these securities as reported in the TIC system for years 2002 forward. When the changes in holdings for these selected accounts are larger than reported in the TIC system and we do not believe these changes reflect custodial shifts, we augment the TIC official transactions to account for these larger increases. We also adjust the TIC transactions for estimated principal repayments on foreign official holdings of Agency MBS., 143107=Figure 12.

Current Account Surpluses and Financial Acquisitions of Certain Surplus Regions 2003 to 2007, 55006=The assumptions regarding the demand curve parameters used in our analysis are listed in the table below. Details of their derivation are described in Appendix A. In short, these parameters were derived from IV estimations of the demand system described in equation (2) above, applied to U.S. and European financial data over the period 1980 to 2007. However, for a number of reasons, these parameters (and the model incorporating them) should be regarded as illustrative rather than a precise representation of actual asset demands. First, asset demand systems are notoriously difficult to estimate, and we had few previous results to draw upon. Second, one of the reasons for the sparseness of previous results is the lack of suitable instruments to distinguish shocks to asset demands from those to asset supplies; we used lagged values of the variables in the model as instruments, but it is unclear how effective this approach really is. Third, in reality investor portfolios are comprised of other assets besides deposits, Treasuries, and U.S. corporate debt, and this also compromises the accuracy of the parameters of interest. The results discussed in this section use our \"baseline\" simulation coefficients; in Table 3, we also show the sensitivity of the results to somewhat higher and lower elasticities calibrated from the estimated standard errors of the portfolio balance model., 86053=Gagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julioe Remarche, and Brian Sack (2010), \"Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?\" Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 441, March., 81075=Beltran, Daniel, Laurie Pounder, and Charles Thomas (2008), \"Foreign Exposure to Asset-Backed Securities of U.S. Origin,\" International Finance Discussion Paper No. 939, August., 101835=The three equations were estimated using two-stage least squares on quarterly data for the period 1980 to 2007. The control variables along with lags of the endogenous variables were used as instruments. Results of the estimation are shown in Table A1. By and large, the estimates are quite reasonable. In the Treasury spreads and corporate spreads equations, the coefficients on the asset shares and the alternative spreads are positive and statistically significant in most cases. In the money demand equation, the coefficients on the two spread variables are significant but quite small, suggesting that the demand for money is not very responsive to longer-term yields, while the coefficient on nominal GDP is positive and significant, as expected., 81673=Bernanke, Ben S.

(2005). \"Living with Global Imbalances: A Contrarian View,\" Peterson Institute for International Economics Policy Brief PB05-3. Washington: Peterson Institute for International Economics, November., 75296=This paper explores the channels through which foreign demand for U.S. assets may have contributed to declines in interest rates and the evolution of the U.S. housing bubble. We distinguish between two prominent sources of foreign demand: demand for Treasuries and Agencies from China, OPEC, and other emerging market Asian economies (the \"global saving glut,\" or GSG, countries), on the one hand, and European demand for U.S. corporate debt, particularly private-label asset-backed securities (ABS), on the other. From 2003 through mid-2007, GSG country acquisitions of Treasuries and Agencies totaled roughly $1 trillion, but European acquisitions of U.S. corporate debt amounted to even more at $1.25 trillion, of which nearly $500 billion consisted of private-label ABS and some of the remainder was comprised of other structured investment products similar to ABS., 29745=Role of ABS It is difficult to determine how much of Europe's overseas acquisitions during the 2003-2007 period were motivated by the desire to reduce home bias (i.e., internationally diversify) in general and how much they were motivated by the demand for specific types of instruments, such as ABS. Purchases of ABS and other structured products stand out as a significant component of the buildup in Europe's cross-border positions, not only vis-\u00e0-vis the United States, as noted earlier, but against all foreign (to Europe) counterparties. Figure 11 shows Europe's holdings of long-term debt securities. Using TIC data, we can identify European-held U.S. ABS and additionally estimate ABS issued in other countries, especially offshore centers. Moreover, the bar segments labeled \"U.S. corporate bonds other than ABS\" and \"offshore bonds, other than ABS\" may in fact contain some ABS, as well as other structured products and financial-sector debt. All told, though it is difficult to distinguish with certainty among the different types of instruments held, it is evident that ABS and other structured debt instruments played an important role in the expansion of external assets in the United Kingdom and the euro area., 48921=Taking our own estimates and applying them to the roughly $1 trillion in Treasury and Agency acquisitions by the GSG countries during the 2003-2007 period, this suggests that those inflows lowered U.S. Treasury yields by 110 basis points. But to what extent did these declines spill over into other interest rates such as those on housing mortgages? Unfortunately, foreign holdings of ABS are only available beginning in 2002; this implies only 20 quarterly observations of our key independent variable, too few to generate reliable estimation results. Moreover, the markets for subprime loans and for private label MBS did not achieve substantial depth and liquidity until the 2000s., 33706=Therefore, the factors that explain European interest in ABS were likely similar to those motivating investors in the United States and elsewhere. Most obviously, ABS was overwhelmingly rated AAA, and so appeared very safe while offering slightly higher returns than Treasuries and Agencies (Bernanke et al., 2011). But some observers argue that the demand for ABS reflected not just a failure to understand the risks, as manifested in misleadingly high ratings, but also agency problems and flawed risk-management systems within the intermediation system (Kashap, Rajan, and Stein, 2008; Arteta et al., 2010): Financial industry participants were well-compensated for acquiring assets earning high returns during good times, but were not penalized for creating exposure to adverse tail risks during bad times. By the same token, industry participants faced few disincentives to acquiring substantial short-term liabilities during periods of high liquidity, even though this made them vulnerable to runs during periods of market stress. And perhaps banks' risk-return tradeoff was distorted by implicit or explicit government guarantees. For example, debt issued by the German Landesbanks prior to 2005 carried explicit state guarantees through 2015 and Arteta et al. (2010) find that Landesbanks were more likely than other banks to sponsor credit arbitrage vehicles, all else equal., 89447=Obstfeld, Maurice and Kenneth Rogoff (2009), \"Global Imbalances and the Financial Crisis: Products of Common Causes,\" Paper presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Asia Economic Policy Conference, Santa Barbara, CA October 18-20., 85369=Dokko, Jane, Brian Doyle, Michael T.

Geographical Breakdown of European Cross-Border Financial Flows in Debt Securities 2003 to 2007, 21031=Of course, some of the investment flows from external deficit countries to the United States were, in essence, recycled flows from external surplus countries to those deficit countries. Figure 7 decomposes Europe's international transactions in debt securities during the 2003-2007 period by the geographical destination of Europe's outward investment (on the claims side) and the source of the inflows (on the liabilities side). Outward investment flowed largely to the United States and offshore centers, whereas most of the expansion in Europe's liabilities is accounted for by increased holdings of its bonds in the international reserves of other countries as well as a large residual category, comprising mainly EMEs and offshore centers. Most likely, both the international reserves and the EME residual category are largely accounted for by liabilities to the global saving glut economies., 88339=Kamin, Steven B. and Laurie Pounder DeMarco (2010), \"How Did a Domestic Housing Slump Turn into a Global Financial Crisis?\" International Finance Discussion Paper No. 994, January., 80621=Baba, Naohiko, Robert N.

Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, February., 61657=Because the securities in our model include only those issued by the United States (and given the home bias in portfolios), the United States has roughly twice the financial wealth of Europe. Europe holds most of its wealth in deposits; its holdings of $400 billion in corporate debt and $1 trillion in Treasuries are roughly comparable to the stocks of U.S. corporate debt and Treasuries and Agencies actually held by Europe in 2003. \"China\" has wealth of $1,000 billion, which is roughly the size of the combined foreign exchange reserves of Asian and OPEC countries in 2003. \"China's\" wealth is held in equal amounts of deposits and Treasuries (and Agencies); the $500 billion assumption for Treasuries is roughly the stock of U.S. Treasuries and Agencies held collectively by emerging Asia/OPEC in 2003., 81291=Bernanke, Ben S. (2005), \"The Global Saving Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit.\" The Sandburg Lecture, Virginia Association of Economists, Richmond, VA, March 10., 106347=To adjust the end-June securities holdings recorded by the surveys to create estimates as of year-end, we use the Bertaut-Tryon (2007) data, which adjusts for financial center transactions bias and valuation changes. These estimates, as well as a detailed methodology of their construction, are available at: http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2007/910/default.htm, 37667=By the 2005-2006 period, however, increases in the federal funds rate had sharply depressed the profitability of U.S. ABS, both in absolute terms and relative to similar measures for the United Kingdom and the euro area. Even so, creation of subprime loans peaked during this period (Figure 17), as did European purchases of corporate bonds, including ABS (Figure 2). Why did Europeans continue to acquire these assets, even after their ex ante return, net of carrying costs, had diminished so greatly?13 The answers are probably the same as those explaining why U.S. and other investors more generally continued to buy ABS: Strong housing price appreciation had substantially held down delinquencies on subprime mortgages, allowing ABS to develop a track record of dependability and an illusion of safety (Gerardi, Lehnert, Sherlund, and Willen, 2008; Demyanyk and van Hemert, 2009). Analysts deeply discounted the possibility of a decline in housing prices, and thus assumed subprime mortgages would continue to be serviced (Gerardi, Lehnert, Sherlund, and Willen, 2008). Low yields and low spreads on other assets reduced the incentives for investors to shift their portfolios toward other investments. And, more generally, a culture of risk-taking had evolved among banks that centered importantly around securitization, and the credit boom developed a momentum of its own in this context (Diamond and Rajan, 2008; Demanyanyk and van Hemert, 2009)., 89848=Rose, Andrew and Mark Spiegel (2009): \"Cross-Country Causes and Consequences of the 2008 Crisis: International Linkages and American Exposure,\" NBER Working Paper 15358, September 2009., 87649=Hubbard, R. Glenn. (2005). \"A Paradox of Interest,\" Wall Street Journal, June 23., 18648=The fact that Europe was issuing external liabilities and acquiring external assets in roughly equal quantities does not mean, however, that the net effect of these transactions on U.S. and global financial markets was a \"wash.\" Figure 6 depicts the evolution of Europe's international balance sheet from 2003 to 2007, showing how its acquisition of external claims was financed by issuance of external liabilities. The composition of these flows of claims and liabilities were broadly similar, but the rise in claims included significant amounts of ABS and other complex financial instruments, whereas the rise in liabilities was tilted toward traditional securities and bank deposits., 17134=One of the most important differences between the foreign (mainly European) acquisitions of U.S. asset-backed securities (ABS) and the purchases of Treasuries and Agencies by the emerging market economies was how these acquisitions were financed. Figure 4 focuses on the three groups of economies most associated with the global saving glut (GSG)--China, other developing Asian economies, and the OPEC countries--and compares their current account surpluses over the period 2003 to 2007 with their acquisition of U.S. securities and their deposits into European banks.4 Although the data are incomplete, it is apparent that these economies' acquisitions of foreign assets were financed primarily by their own current account surpluses. It is also apparent that these surpluses financed not only purchases of U.S. assets, but investments in other economies, such as Europe, as well. Data on the allocation of OPEC assets, unfortunately, is especially incomplete, but it is likely that much of their overseas investments went into purchases of European assets and U.S. assets held by third-party custodians and thus not picked up in the TIC data., 89730=Rajan, Raghuram (2010), Fault Lines, Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 79693=Albertus, Jim, Carol Bertaut, and Stephanie Curcuru \"Has the Crisis Changed Foreign Positions in U.S. Securities?\" Federal Reserve staff working paper 2010., 46308=The equation is estimated using quarterly data for the period 1990 through the first half of 2007. The first column of Table 2 presents the estimation results. The foreign official share of Treasuries and Agencies significantly decreases Treasury yields, just as in Warnock and Warnock (2009). The long-run effect of a one percentage point rise in this share is to depress Treasury yields by 7 basis points. Evaluated using the level of outstanding Treasuries and agencies in June 2007, this implies that $100 billion in foreign official inflows depresses Treasury yields by 11 basis points. The table below compares this estimated effect of Treasury purchases with that derived from other studies, including some also focusing on the effect of foreign capital inflows on yields (Warnock and Warnock, 2009, Beltran et al., 2011, and Rudebusch, Swanson, and Wu, 2006) and others focusing on the effects of the Federal Reserve's recent asset purchase programs (Gagnon et al., 2010, D'Amico and King, 2010, and Hamilton and Wu, 2010). The estimated effects in these studies are quite dispersed, and our own estimates seem to fall squarely within their range., 86741=Greenspan, Alan (2005). \"Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,\" statement before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, February 16., 82368=Bertaut, Carol, William Griever, and Ralph Tryon (2006), \"Understanding U.S. Cross-Border Securities Data,\" Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Bulletin, May., 128480=Figure 6.

In the figure, reductions in home bias are expressed as positive values--the red portions of the bars represent the reduction in home bias associated with expanded holdings of ABS, while the blue portions represent reductions in home bias associated with acquisitions of other debt securities. For most of the economies examined, ABS accounted for a substantial part of the change in portfolios associated with a reduction in home bias during the period., 82135=Bertaut, C.C. and Linda S. Kole (2004), \"What Makes Investors Over or Underweight?

The coefficient on this variable is significant, and implies that the 7.5 percentage point rise in the foreign share of U.S. corporate bonds outstanding between 2002 and June 2007 depressed AAA corporate yields by 95 basis points. Moreover, the coefficient is likely biased upwards (less negative) by the endogeneity problem, as feedback from shocks to corporate bond yields should lead to increases in the same direction of foreign purchases of these bonds., 27843=Falling home bias9 Europeans were not acquiring U.S. assets solely to maintain the shares of these assets in their portfolios, however. They were also boosting the shares in their portfolio of external assets in general, and U.S. assets in particular, thereby bringing these shares closer to the levels consistent with global market capitalizations. The X-axis of Figure 10 plots the evolution of Europeans' relative portfolio weight in all externally-issued bonds: A value of 1 indicates that the share of the external bonds in Europe's portfolio was equal to the share of the external bonds' value in the total global value of bonds outstanding (i.e., no home bias); a value of zero indicates that none of the foreign bonds were being held (complete home bias).10 The y-axis computes Europeans' relative portfolio weight in U.S.-issued bonds: Again, a value of 1 indicates that the share of U.S. bonds in European portfolios was equal to their share in global market capitalization, while a value of zero indicated no U.S. bonds were being held. The figure indicates that in 2002, Europe started with considerable home bias in its holdings of all external bonds (a portolio weight of only about .19), and even more home bias against holdings of U.S. bonds (a portfolio weight of .14). However, by 2007, Europe had reduced its home bias against both externally-issued bonds in general and U.S. bonds in particular, boosting the shares of both in its portfolio. Thus, even if the dollar value of Europe's total securities holdings (both domestic- and externally- issued) had remained constant between 2002 and 2007, the reduction in bias against U.S. holdings would have, by itself, accounted for $150 billion in acquisitions of U.S. debt securities., 81499=Bernanke, Ben S. (2007), \"Global Imbalances: Recent Developments and Prospects.\" The Bundesbank Lecture, Berlin, Germany, September 11., 35842=Role of Interest Rates A recurrent issue in discussions of the U.S. subprime housing boom is the role played by U.S. monetary policy. It is beyond the scope of this paper to address the contribution of the very low federal funds rate in the 2002-2004 period to the U.S. housing boom, sub-prime lending, or the securitization process in general.12 However, it bears asking whether the evolution of U.S. policy rates influenced the large European acquisitions of U.S. assets, especially ABS. As shown in the top panel of Figure 15, policy interest rates in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the euro area all dipped in response to the mild economic recession early in the decade, but U.S. rates clearly fell the most. According to standard international economic theory, this differential should have triggered capital flows from the United States toward Europe. But this theory ignores the fact that most banking activity avoids exchange rate exposure and seeks to maintain a \"matched book\" between the currency denomination of assets and liabilities. The remaining panels of Figure 15 present data on what may have been a more relevant consideration, the differential between the yield on highly rated corporate bonds and short-term funding costs, as proxied by the countries' respective policy interest rates. By this measure, the profitability of corporate bonds funded by short-term debt was highest in the United States during the 2002-2004 period, and along with other factors described above likely played a role--just how large is difficult to say--in encouraging European financial institutions to simultaneously take on long-term U.S. corporate assets (including ABS) financed by short-term dollar liabilities., 292018=2.\u00a0\u00a0 Albertus, Bertaut, and Curcuru \"Has the Crisis Changed Foreign Positions in U.S. Securities?\" Federal Reserve staff working paper 2010.\u00a0Return to text, 14373=Figure 1 summarizes the evolution of U.S. external liabilities, while Figure 2 compares the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Treasuries and Agencies with that into U.S. corporate bonds. The increase in liabilities that financed the U.S. current account deficit in the years leading up to the crisis was very broad-based (Figure 1). While the stock of U.S. Treasuries and Agencies held by foreigners exceeded foreign holdings of corporate bonds, by 2007 the latter (including ABS) were nearly as large. Moreover, in the years leading up to the crisis, foreign flows into corporate debt were at least as large as those into Treasuries and Agencies (Figure 2). Nearly half of these inflows into corporate bonds involved the purchase of ABS. In addition, much of the non-ABS corporate debt securities purchased by foreigners were in the form of financial debt, floating rate notes, and various structured products, rather than relatively safe conventional nonfinancial corporate bonds. 2, 85686=Dooley, Michael P., David Folkerts-Landau, and Peter Garber (2003), \"An Essay on the Revived Bretton Woods System,\" NBER Working Paper 9971, September., 15949=However, the geographic distribution of the inflows into these respective securities was quite different. Figure 3 shows the cumulated flows into the same securities as Figure 2, but differentiates these inflows by region of origin. Inflows from Emerging Asia and the Middle East were almost entirely in the form of U.S. Treasuries and Agencies, and investors from these countries account for about 60 percent of the inflows into these securities from 2003 up to June 2007. In contrast, inflows from Europe were largely in the form of corporate debt securities; they accounted for about two-thirds of the total foreign purchases of corporate debt and a little over half of the total foreign purchases of ABS. Most of the remaining capital inflows into corporate debt and ABS came from Caribbean financial centers.3 The stark differences in the geography of the inflows suggest that ABS played a very different role in the evolution of capital inflows than that described by the global saving glut story., 32245=But what accounts for the Europeans' interest in U.S. ABS? To begin with, the investment strategies of European financial institutions were not all that different than those of similar institutions in the United States and other parts of the world. Figure 14 describes the evolution of the composition of U.S. holdings by U.S. and foreign residents. Between 2003 and 2007, the share of ABS in the portfolios of both European residents (the third set of panels) and U.S. residents (the fourth set) expanded significantly as the shares allocated to Treasuries and agencies declined.11 Although the share of European holdings allocated to ABS grew by more than did the ABS share of U.S. residents' holdings, this in large part appears to reflect the Europeans' greater taste for fixed income securities than for equities; focusing on their fixed-income portfolios alone, the share of ABS rose by broadly similar margins for Europeans and U.S. residents. Research by Arteta et al. (2010) also suggests that Europeans did not have a higher intrinsic demand for ABS. Arteta et al. show that large, global banks were especially likely to sponsor the vehicles that purchased ABS financed with commercial paper, and most of those banks were headquartered in Europe; in a regression explaining bank sponsorship of ABS vehicles, a dummy variable for U.S. banks is not statistically significant., 88558=Kashyap, Anil K., Raghuram G.

This research has followed two distinct strands. The first of these is the story sketched out above, in which current account surpluses in the emerging market economies increased the global supply of capital, reduced interest rates in the United States and other advanced economies, and thus encouraged the emergence of the bubble in subprime housing mortgages. Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2009), Jagannathan, Kapoor, and Schaumburg (2009), Obstfeld and Rogoff (2009), and Rajan (2010), among others, all discuss variants of this argument. Members of the official sector, such as Bernanke (2009) and Bini Smaghi (2008) have also highlighted this line of causation., 82808=Blanchard, Olivier, Francesco Giavazzi, and Filipa Sa (2005). \"The U.S. Current Account and the Dollar, \"NBER Working Paper Series 11137.

Survey reports are available on the Treasury website at, 3853=It is widely accepted that international capital flows played an important role in the emergence of the U.S. housing bubble and the global financial crisis that followed the bursting of that bubble. In this view, an excess of saving over investment in many emerging market economies, popularly referred to as the \"global saving glut\" (Bernanke, 2005, 2007), led to a surge in capital inflows to the United States that increased available credit and lowered interest rates. In combination with a number of additional factors--the increase in securitization, excessive reliance on credit ratings, increases in leverage, failures to manage liquidity and risk, and inadequacies of supervision and regulation--the expansion of financing associated with the capital inflows contributed to the U.S. housing bubble and to the buildup in financial vulnerabilities more generally that led to the crisis., 85157=Diamond, Douglas W. and Raghuram G.

The $13.6 trillion rise in European holdings of debt securities from the end of 2002 to the middle of 2007 meant that, even if the share of U.S. assets in those assets had remained constant at its end-2002 level of 6 percent, Europe would have had to acquire an additional $800 billion in U.S. assets., 90296=Sa, Filipa, Pascal Towbin, and Tomasz Wieladek (2011), \"Low interest rates and housing booms: the role of capital inflows, monetary policy, and financial innovation,\" Bank of England Working Paper No. 411, February 2011., 73255=In Simulation 3a, we boost the quantity of ABS by 25 percent (initially distributed on a pro rata basis to U.S. and European investors, based on their initial holdings), comparable to its actual rise during the 2003-2007 period. This leads to an increase in the share of U.S. corporate debt in total wealth at the expense of the shares of both Treasuries and deposits. As expected, this shock generates a pronounced increase in the ABS yield--by roughly 100 basis points--to persuade U.S. and European investors to absorb the excess ABS supply. Because of the substitutability between ABS and Treasuries, Treasury yields also rise, by about 70 basis points., 68171=Simulation 1: Greater Chinese Treasuries purchases Inflows from the saving glut countries are modeled as an exogenous increase in China's wealth, matched--consistent with the external surpluses being run against the United States--by an equally-sized rundown of deposits held by the United States. China's external investments rise from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, in the neighborhood of the increase in foreign exchange reserves of the saving glut countries from 2003 through 2006. With China's portfolio shares remaining constant at \u00bd for deposits and \u00bd for Treasuries (as they are assumed to be invariant with respect to interest rates), the shock leads to $1 trillion in additional acquisitions of U.S. Treasuries and Agencies, leading the share of these securities outstanding held by China to rise to 17 percent and the share held by all foreigners to rise to nearly 30 percent., 15442=Another way to gauge the importance of foreign asset holdings is to consider their share of the total outstanding stocks of these assets, shown in Table 1. On the eve of the financial crisis in mid-2007, while foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries and Agencies were a large share of the amount outstanding--31 percent--foreign holdings of ABS were not all that far behind. At 24 percent, they represented a substantial share of the market, certainly enough to have had a material impact on pricing., 87981=Johnson, Karen, \"Gross or Net International Financial Flows: Understanding the Financial Crisis,\" Council on Foreign Relations Working Paper, July 2009., 296795=12.\u00a0\u00a0 For discussions of the role of U.S. interest rates in the runup to the crisis, see, among others, Taylor (2008), Dokko et.al.

This decline in subprime spreads is quite remarkable, given the explosion in the number of subprime loans issued over this period: subprime originations grew nearly 20-fold, far faster than issuance of Treasuries.

For the United Kingdom, these are available in the annual Pink Book and associated data set: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/product.asp?vlnk=1140. These sources provide data on three types of cross-border investment: direct investment, portfolio investment (equity and debt securities), and other investment (banking and other transactions). Summing the flows of the euro area and the U.K. would overstate their combined net flows with the rest of the world because it would include their flows to each other. To correct this, we subtract the flows between the two economies, primarily using the geographical breakdowns of their IIPs.20 All flows and positions are converted to U.S. dollars on a quarterly basis., 31809=One of the reasons why ABS accounted for so much of the expansion of Europe's cross-border assets, of course, is that most of the ABS was being issued outside of Europe, so European investors had perforce to engage in cross-border transactions to acquire it.

However, they do not shed light on the size of the additional impact on yields of direct purchases of ABS and other corporate debt securities by Europe and other non-GSG countries. This impact is more difficult to estimate, as, unlike foreign official inflows, European purchases of U.S. corporate securities are likely to be endogenous with respect to the yields on those assets. For this reason, we instead examine illustrative simulations of a stylized portfolio balance model in Section V below.}",
