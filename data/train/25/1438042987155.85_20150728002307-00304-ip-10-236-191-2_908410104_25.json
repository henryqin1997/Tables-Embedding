            "The campus is pretty safe in that I haven't heard of really any crimes being committed ON campus. However, just off of campus in Dinkytown and on Como; there are quite a few crimes that take place. Make sure that you are always aware of your surroundings, don't walk in those areas at night by yourself if you can avoid it and use commonsense when applicable. Most crimes can be avoided with the simple use of awareness and commonsense.",
            "As I stated, there are a multitude of clubs and activities, so there is something for everyone. Take a look at the clubs and activities page on onestop and find one that interests you.",
            "Any and all types of students. There are hundreds of clubs that are eager for new members and they stretch to even the most introverted students.",
            "It is quite pricey, especially if you are coming from out of state or did not receive any scholarships. While it is a great college that provides a lot of opportunities to succeed, it is still expensive and that is something that should be considered before coming.",
            "Since the U of M is so conveniently located, there is a surplus of things to do. The Mall of America is a 40 minute train ride away, there are essentially four downtowns that are just a simple bus ride away, Target Center and Target Field are both located in downtown Minneapolis, there are other malls located in Woodbury if you would like to avoid the MOA traffic, and there are a multitude of things to do on campus as well. In other words, being bored on this campus is an option that is usually chosen through laziness and not lack of options.",
            "As I stated, the food in Comstock is less than desirable. Additionally, the food in superblock isn't very great either. If you are willing to make the treck over to Middlebrook, Sanford, or Bailey Halls; then the food there will be much better. It is all about where you live on campus. Though I have not been to many campuses to try their food, I imagine that it is a similar feeling on most college campuses. One other thing is that there are a lot of quality restaurants just a short walk from campus; so you will always be able to escape campus food if/when you need to.",
            "Like any place of living, your experience is shaped by who you meet while living there and by your neighbors (the people that live in your hall or above you). In my experience at the U of M, I found that most of the people are very nice. Most of my close friends at college were met in my dorm (Comstock). I must warn you that the food is not great there, so if you are looking for good food I would consider living in Bailey (which is in St. Paul :/), Middlebrook, or Sanford. Though, Comstock is the most centrally located dorm so it provides better access to all of your classes.",
            "It really all depends on your major. Some majors have classes that are easier than high school courses, while others have an average grade of 40% for all students (these are mostly CSE classes). So depending on what you are looking to major in, the academic rigor can be highly intense or very minimal. I would say, though that this disparity can be found at any University and for the tough majors that in which the U is highly ranked, the classes are pretty tough.",
            "As a current student, I have some hindsight on things I would have done differently if I were able to start my college career all over again. The benefit to this insight is that I am able to pass it along to others so that they don't make the same mistakes that I have made. One tip that I have for prospective students is to get involved in clubs and other activities on campus. This helps build community involvement and gives you a new appreciation for the U. Also I would recommend that you listen to your professors in regards to doing the practice problems. I shrugged their advice off in several classes only to find out, while cramming a few days before the final, that the practice problems were my best way of learning the material. As much as it sucks, it does help. Lastly, remember to make room for fun or conversely make room for studies; depending on where you are. It is important to stay balance so that you can have a well-balanced college experience.",
            "The U of M is a great university with a lot to offer any prospective student. It as one of the top non-ivy league universities in the world. Given that the Twin-Cities is full of fortune 500 companies who are eager to hire U of M alumni, a lot of doors are opened post-graduation."

However, make sure to apply before the priority deadline, usually in early December. Look up additional scholarships on the website., 43041=It is best to apply early to the University, usually before their priority deadline in mid December. Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved! You will have fun doing something you like while also meeting people. These people may become great friends later on or lead you to someone who can help you down the road in life., 147194=I can't think of a single student who found the academic rigor at the U of M to be lacking. Some courses will naturally be easier than others (especially 1000-level ones); however, those will be worth fewer credit hours in order to reflect that. Also worth iterating is the fact that the common misconception of science and math classes being more difficult is not necessarily true here; as a foreign language major, I can attest to the fact that As are not just handed out willy-nilly. All subject areas require work; there are no easy majors\u00e2??., 999561=The University of Minnesota is a very good school, it is ranked one of the top 10 research universities when I started attending in 2005. The classes are quite large and so you would need to develop a very healthy studying schedule to keep up with course work. That or you can visit the professors during office hours., 36546=The class content depends a bit on what the class is. Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants. Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation. All of that said, what someone learns depends mostly on that person's effort put into the class., 413694=On the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus we have the Weisman Art Museum. This building stands out from any other building on campus because of its postmodern architecture. It was just reopened in the fall of 2011 after it underwent a major expansion project. The museum now has many more works of art on display than it ever had before., 929488=I'd definitely give the University a 9.5 out of 10. I've actually been living here since the beginning of June and honestly I feel welcomed everyday I'm here. The University of Minnesota is full of fun, energetic, and friendly people that make up the rate 9.5, 347397=just a warning: the light rail won't be done until 2015 which blocks off all of washington ave., 770830=There's lots of cheap dates. There's a telescope on the physics building that is free to use after 8 o'clock and they show free movies in one of the buildings before the movies come out on video., 1062419=There are crime alerts that go on and it is very convenient that the university will text you on your phone and email you. Also you can call someone walk with you at night if you feel unsafe, you just call an escort. In addition there is the Gopher Chauffeur that takes calls till 2:00 AM., 929067=If you want to get into the University of Minnesota feel proud. The U of MN had 43,000 applicants for the incoming class of 2017, and only 5500 applicants were accepted. Definitely take your application seriously and meet every deadline.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck I would say, as all colleges, it is definitely pricey, but of all the schools I have visited and been to during the academic year, the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities offers so much more for your dollar. There are so many different kinds of people on campus, and groups and clubs for everything imagineable, so you are going to find everything you want and way way more for your dollar! The campus is so huge, everything about the classes and teachers is GREAT, and you'll make a million new friends and have so many opportunities going to school in the cities, that is is worth every penny. Am enjoying being here Right between St. Paul and Minneapolis, there is always stuff to do, people to meet, and you will always, always have something new to do every weekend. The sports scene is amazing if you love sports, and the night life is pretty epic, too! I can't tell you enough how much I love the cities, and how campus feels comfortable and safe, but has so many big-city things to see and do! Am learning a lot It is a huge change from high school, in my opinion, when it comes to how much you learn. College",
