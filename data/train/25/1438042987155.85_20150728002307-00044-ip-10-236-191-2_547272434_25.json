For example, on November 8, 1994, Microsoft and VISA (the credit card company) announced the provision of a standard and secure method \"for executing electronic bankcard transactions across global public and private networks.' Visa News Release, Nov. 8, 1994 (Ex. 39). In the question and answer session following the press release, the VISA spokesperson said that the driving force in VISA's decision to do the deal with Microsoft was the fact that Microsoft had an installed base of 60 million copies of Windows. The significance of Visa's agreement with Microsoft is not lost on industry observers. See, e.g., Elizabeth Corcoran, Washington Post, Nov. 12, 1994, supra, at H6. Nor is it likely to be the last such agreement: the Post reported, for example, that \"four telecommunications companies are expected to announce on Monday [November 14, 1994] that they are working with Microsoft to make dialing into Marvel a local call for many subscribers.\" Id. And, on December 21, 1994, Microsoft announced that Tele-Communications, Inc. purchased a 20% stake in the Microsoft Network for $125 million. The deal implies a value of $625 million for an on-line service that doesn't exist yet .... \"Jim Carlton & G. Pascal Zachary, Microsoft Sells A 20% Interest In Planned Unit, Wall St. J., Dec. 22, 1994. Once again, Microsoft is controlling the architecture and using a nominally open standard., 442865=Personal computers were primitive compared with mainframes and minicomputers. But they, could perform simple tasks such as word processing, keeping mailing lists or playing games, and they proved surprisingly popular. To grab some of the revenue from this small but burgeoning market, IBM launched its own PC in 1981. Because it wanted to do this quickly, it assembled its machine from off-the-shelf components made by firms which were also supplying other Pc: makers. It arranged to buy the two most important parts of the machine- the microprocessor and the operating-system software--from (respectively) Intel and a small Seattle- based company called Microsoft., 126237=In the face of mounting criticism, Microsoft executives adhered to the party line. For example, in 1989, Steve Ballmer again disputed \"the charge that his people gave their counterparts in applications previews of their upcoming systems products.\"71 Microsoft executives repeatedly told the press that a \"Chinese Wall\" was in place. See, e.g., Laurie Flynn and Rachel Parker, Infoworld, Aug. 7, 1989, supra, at 43. Indeed,, 203698=11 Amy Cortese, No Slack for Microsoft Rivals, Business Week, Dec. 19, 1994, at 35 (Ex. 5)., 444769=Until the mid-1980s, many PCs were sold customers--individuals, schools, small businesses, professional firms--who would never have been reached by tram or other established computer makers. But when big corporate customers began tying the mast powerful PCs together into networks as alternatives to minicomputers and mainframes, IBM became alarmed. In 1987 it belatedly tried to gain control of the personal-computer market with new models containing a patented technology called Microchannel, which rivals could not copy and which made IBM's machines incompatible with everyone else's. Competitors aptly dubbed these machines \"clone killers\". But by then it too late. The PC market had slipped beyond IBM's grasp and the Microchannel machines flopped. Big Blue, like any other manufacturer, had to make its machines fit the industry's standards. Three were now set by millions of personal-computes users and owned by. Intel and Microsoft., 821590=Microsoft was fed up with the investigation, which had begun in 1989 with an inconclusive Federal Trade Commission inquiry. The Justice Department picked up the case last August., 111659=As new technologies overcame the old mainframe market, the market for computer products formed into a number of horizontal markets that are vertically related to each other. Charles R. Morris and Charles H. Ferguson, Harv. Bus. Rev., Mar. 1993, supra, at 8 (Ex. 16). There are many competitors at each level that aggressively compete with each other to develop more powerful products at lower prices. Generally speaking, consumers have benefitted from the formation of horizontal markets. Consumers can put a system together using the best and most cost effective products at each level, even if the products are made by different manufacturers. But by using its installed base in operating systems to \"tip\" each of these markets in favor of its own products, Microsoft undermines the competitive process. From the initial monopoly bestowed on it by IBM and the huge installed base secured by anticompetitive practices, Microsoft has leveraged and linked a series of powerful monopolies with the intent of forming a new verticality on the market. After establishing several monopolies with enormous leverage potential, the positive feedback from the verticality imposed by Microsoft will in short order eliminate competition on all horizontal layers within the server and online markets, .just as it is eliminating competition in the horizontal layers on the desktop., 95672=The self-perpetuating nature of an installed base in an increasing returns industry causes particular products to become \"locked-in.\" W. Brian Arthur, Scientific American, Feb. 1990, supra, at 99 (Ex. 36). The costs to a consumer of using or switching to a different system are so high that the vendor with the installed base has a substantial advantage over competitors and can, once the base is established, charge consumers supracompetitive prices.56, 149546=And, as if Microsoft's use of leverage to dominate the home and on-line markets is not sufficient, Microsoft announced on October 13, 199487 its intention to buy Intuit. Inc., paying a 100% premium to market. See supra note 36. Intuit publishes the personal finance and tax planning software programs that dominate their respective markets. Intuit's product controls 80-85% of the personal finance markets.88, 8831=Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. United Airlines, Inc., 948 F.2d 536 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1603 (1992), 748687=Microsoft competitors have taken great pleasure in the slow acceptance of the much hyped NT. Some of this gloating is certainly well deserved. After a long period of anticipatory eulogies for competitive operating systems, NT barely shipped 400,000 units in its first full year of availability. This is one-sixth the number of OS/2 shipments and only marginally higher than Solaris' 1993 shipments (see Figure I). Moreover. the majority of NT shipments axe either free copies or axe being used for development or evaluation., 208008=26 See, e.g., Paul Andrews, Can Microsoft Just Do It?, Seattle Times, March 18, 1991, at B1 (Microsoft \"repeatedly' asserted \"that a 'Chinese Wall' exists between its applications and systems divisions\"); Microsoft and IBM Under Investigation by FTC, Technical Computing, Apr. 1, 1991 (\"Microsoft maintains that it does not take unfair advantage of advance knowledge of operating systems in designing its consumer products.

Also at Comdex, several PC vendors claimed to have been discouraged by Microsoft from demonstrating IBM's OS/2 Warp at the show. Hewlett-Packard Co. and Packard Bell were among the companies that decided at the last minute against showing OS/2 as a result of implied and suggested retaliation from Microsoft, according to several sources close to the companies., 186407=In January of 1982, the Department of Justice filed a Final Judgment breaking up the AT&T monopoly. In its response to comments on the proposed final judgment, the Government explained that it sought broad relief to prevent the type of leverage that Microsoft is currently employing:, 407364=Who Won? The consent decree was first viewed as a victory for the DoJ and Microsoft's com- petitors. The New York Times (July 17) carried the front-page headline, \"Microsoft's Grip on Software Loosened by Antitrust Deal,\" and crowed that \"the pact could reshape the world of computing .... The accord could undermine Microsoft's near total control of tile market for operating systems.\" The Boston Globe's headline was equally enthusiastic: \"Microsoft Accord to Greate Competition in US. Europe.\", 261179=PREEMINENT POSITION. As the battle begins to heat up, no company has produced the supporter that could carry the day: IBM. \"IBM has established such a preeminent position in the marketplace that the supplier that has its environment on IBM will have the greatest success,\" says John R. Keifer, senior analyst at InfoCorp. Since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981, the computer giant has won more than 26% of the market. As many as 75% of personal computers, industry observers agree, are expected to follow the IBM PC design by 1985 (BW -- Oct. 3)., 84508=Even more striking is the fact that Microsoft continues to exercise the very same strategy on the server side. See, e.g., J. William Semich, Datamation, Aug. 1. 1994, supra, at 40, 41-44 (Ex. 10) (\"If you think OLE is everywhere in the future, the answer is yes\"). Microsoft has made it clear that OLE will be strategic technology for the home-to-business server market, but Microsoft has not provided sufficient specifications to independent database server providers to enable them to release equally well-behaved products on the same time schedule as Microsoft's own products.38, 12022=PC Week, Feb. 21, 1994 (Paine Webber, Inc.

Econ. Rev., Dec. 1986, supra., 139799=In addition, Microsoft is nakedly leveraging its market power in the desktop operating system market to the enterprise server by requiring software developers who want to use the logo for \"Windows 95,\" the forthcoming version of Microsoft's desktop operating system, to make their desktop application products also run on \"Windows NT\" (Microsoft's server operating system). See William Brandel, Developing for Next Generation of Windows May Mean Running on NT, Computerworld, November 18, 1994, at 4. There is no technical reason to require an application to run on both Microsoft's desktop and server: indeed, a user would not even expect (nor perhaps even want) a \"Windows 95\" application program to run on the server. Microsoft's requirement is simply another way of leveraging:, 267629=And it Agenda 90, a recent trade conference outsiders were angered to see an Excel specialist demonstrating new operating system features that they hadn't been briefed on.

A vast corps of electronics engineers and programmers have been trained over the past two decades. Their job mobility and willingness to take risks are legendary. Firms have little difficulty recruiting talent, and lots of new companies are formed every year. Even in microprocessors--a capital-intensive, specialised business--intel now faces competition from a small, Texas-based firm called Cyrix, started by two engineers in 1988, in the late 1980s Toshiba, a distant also-ran in personal computers, shocked the industry when its laptop models, not those of the industry's established leaders, became a hit everywhere. Toshiba, in its turn, was shocked when its early lead was eroded by a wave of imitators, most of them American., 13119=Jesse Berst, Behind The Smoke: Microsoft Wins Again, PC Week, July 25, 1994, at 106, 243886=APPENDIX TO MEMORANDUM OF AMICI CURIAE IN OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT IN CIVIL ACTION NO. 94-1564 (SS) SIGNED BY GARY REBACK, 467986=Third, far more often than most companies, computer firms are not selling their products to an established market, but trying to create demand for an entirely new product. This involves a lot of sheer guesswork. In 1991 many firms expected pen computers to take the industry by storm (these allow people to enter information by writing with a stylus on an electronic notepad rather than using a keyboard). Since then, sales have been disappointing. Pen computers are now seen as a niche product with limited potential., 204830=15 Nor has the irony of this withdrawal been lost on the computer industry. As one observer noted: \"July [of 1994] saw Microsoft in full agreement with the Justice Department. Microsoft agreed to withdraw the 'per processor' option that most PC suppliers found the cheapest way to buy DOS [in order to] encourage firms to offer alternatives to Microsoft's operating systems.

The most stoking thing is that the new industry Is a series of horizontal layers, each containing many companies, rather than the vertical, single-company towers of the old industry. Each layer represents a distinct market. The barriers to entry, for new firms vary from laver to layer: but in no layer are they as high as they were for the old computer industry as a whole, in which any new firm hoping to challenge the established computer companies head-on had to build an entire vertical tower of its own. As a result, competition in every layer of the new industry is much fiercer than it ewer was in the old.

Don Clark & Laurie Hays, Wall St. J., Dec. 12, 1994, supra, at B6. In short, Microsoft's new practices achieve substantially the same effect as those banned by the Judgment., 583211=The information needed for competing vendors to develop ,her own drag-and-drop servers remained undock- mented until an article by Jeffrey Richter-- the author of Windows 3.1: A Developer's Guide (M&T Publishing. 1991) -- appeared m the May-June 1992 issue of the Microsoft Systems Journal. Even then, the information appeared only after attempts by Microsoft officials to suppress the article and after another publication threatened to run it. 'The Microsoft Systems Journal article by Jeffrey Richter was star[led by Microsoft for months because of resistance in the company to publishing this article,\" says Undocumented Windows coauthor Schulman. Richter confirmed this saying. \"It was held up by \ufffd Windows 3.1 product manager,\" whom he declined to identify., 406055=On Friday, July 15. Microsoft signed a consent decree with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), ending a four-year investigation by U.S. antimonopoly agencies-first the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and later the DoJ--into Microsoft's trade practices. At the same time, Microsoft signed a nearly identical settlement with the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission. The judgment lasts for six and a half years in the U.S., four and a half in Europe., 50381=A comparison of the information provided in those cases relied upon by the Department, with that provided here, highlights just how far short the Department has fallen in providing this Court with an adequate record upon which to act. For example, the Department relies heavily upon the Court of Appeals' decision affirming a modification of the consent decree in United States v. Western Electric Co., Inc., 993 F.2d at 1572. See 59 Fed. Reg. at 59,429.24 However, in finding that there was a sufficient \"factual foundation for the judgment call made by the Department of Justice and to make its conclusion reasonable,\" 993 F. 2d at 1582, the Court of Appeals in that case expressly pointed to the \"array of prominent economists (including two Nobel laureates, Stigler and Arrow),\" who had submitted affidavits in the record that supported the Department's position. These affidavits provided detailed support for the factual predicates underlying the Department's proposal, including the view that the Bell operating companies would not be able to discriminate or engage in cross-subsidization: that government oversight would be effective in regulating their behavior; and that the proposal would enhance competition in the relevant markets. See id. at 1578-82., 80104=The home computer market is in its incipiency. The most important applications programs on the home client are \"home banking\" (also sometimes known as \"personal finance\") and tax preparation.34 The most successful company in this market, Intuit, Inc., makes the largest selling home banking (\"Quicken\") and tax preparation (\"TurboTax\") programs. The only substantial competition to Intuit's products comes from Microsoft. Yet, despite a very. substantial commitment in marketing staff and resources, Microsoft has gained only a 10% share. Microsoft has therefore elected to take over the home finance market by purchasing the leading software developer, Intuit, rather than by making better products to compete against it. The Microsoft acquisition of Intuit was announced on October 13, 1994 and is still under review by the Department of Justice. It is the largest acquisition in the history of the industry with Microsoft paying twice as much for Intuit as that company was worth in the stock market.35, 98870=The Justice Department's complaint in this case recognizes the critical importance of an \"installed base.\" The complaint alleges that the \"lack of a sizable installed base of users\" constitutes a \"substantial barrier to entry\" for Microsoft's operating system competitors. 59 Fed Reg. at 42,847 (Complaint \ufffd 15). The complaint also alleges that Microsoft used \"anticompetitive contracting practices\" including \"per processor licenses\" starting as early as 1988 to \"significantly increase the already high barriers to entry.\" Id. at 42,847, 42,848 (Complaint \ufffd\ufffd 18, 20, 26). The complaint appears to assume that Microsoft's monopoly was lawfully acquired. Id. at 42,847 (Complaint \ufffd 19). But since Microsoft's installed base of operating system users has increased six-fold since 1988, it must follow that the \"anticompetitive licensing practices\" with which Microsoft is charged had the result of increasing its own installed base at the same time it impeded the development of competitors' installed bases. As set forth in the next section, Microsoft has used its installed base both to preclude competitive entry into the operating system market, and to stifle competition in related markets., 833501=LOAD-DATE-MDC: November 8, 1994, 446936=Instead of the proprietary hardware and operating-system software of the old industry, \"open\" standards now prevail. These permit the products of a growing number of computer firms to work together, which has opened the door to thousands of new firms that now compete at every link of the \"value chain\", from chips to distribution. Peter Shavoir. IBM's chief business strategist, estimates that 2,500 firms took some pan in the computer industry of 1965, but that 50,000 jostle for business now. Most of the new ones entered the industry, m the 19805 along with the personal computer., 705638=Microsoft's revenues in the world market for personal computer business grew more in 1994 than revenues in the market as a whole, according to preliminary estimates by Dataquest Inc.

By way of comparison, in United States v. Yoder, 1989-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) . 68.723, at 61,797 (N.D. Ohio 1986), the Department provided the court with an affidavit identifying the number of competitors, distributors and customers in the industry, whom it had contacted about a proposed modification to a consent decree, and described the responses and concerns of those contacted. See id. at 61,797 n. 10. Here, the Department has simply asserted orally that \"by and large I think we got positive feedback\" from competitors and customers, then adding (in response to a comment by the Court) \"there were clearly some people who wished that we had done more.\" Tr. of Status Call, Sept. 29, 1994., at 13:16-22. These observations certainly do not give the Court the full flavor of industry concerns, but critical reports in the media amply document the true reaction in the industry to the proposed decree.106 It is, therefore unnecessary to further burden the Court with affidavits or the testimony from those in the industry, regarding these concerns., 411973=Some commentators see these increasing ties, and the DoJ's apparent refusal to touch them, as a good thing. For example, Steward Alsop was quoted in the New York Times (July 18) as saying, \"If you really care about improving the personal computer, you want Microsoft to take over all the pieces of the pie.\", 341082=But the UNIX database oligopoly is only haft right.

Control of the \"human interface\" gateway on the home computer through the acquisition of Intuit will only heighten Microsoft's control throughout the market. In short, the prospects of an alliance to compete effectively with Microsoft, in the current market where the gateways are controlled by Microsoft, are extremely remote. Competitors would have to produce a competing information infrastructure through a different paradigm (e.g., cable television), something that is years, if not decades, away. Microsoft is, moreover, already committing substantial resources -- reportedly 500 employees by next June -- in anticipation of this paradigm shift. See Elizabeth Corcoran, Washington Post, Nov. 13, 1994, supra, at H6 (Ex. 44). It therefore is clearly preparing now to be in a position to control this new paradigm as well., 297214=Gates is accurate when he points out that his applications business now generates more profits--about 50% of net income--than operating software.

Relevant decisions have reflected increasing returns-type analyses. For example, in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992), the Supreme Court held that factual issues regarding consumer \"lock-in\" in the after-market for replacement parts constituted a proper basis on which to deny motions for summary judgment in a tie-in case.

Software rivals insist that Microsoft's hyperaggressiveness--its use of every trick at its disposal to gain an edge, enter a new segment, or eke out one more iota of market share--has started to edge out innovation itself as the force that determines the shape of the industry. Microsoft Chairman William H. Gates III says such charges are ridiculous. \"Our success is based on only one thing: good products. It's not very complicated,\" he says. \"We're not powerful enough to cause products that are not excellent to sell well.\" Still, complaints from other software makers helped spur a 2 1/2-year investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into Microsoft's tactics.

Microsoft has a big lead with a product called Windows, which runs on MS-DOS machines and mimics the easy point-and-click icons of Apple's computers. It has already sold more than 20m copies. But IBM is heavily promoting OS/2, its rival to Windows. In network operating-systems, which run on the machines at the centre of client-server networks, Novell has scored a success similar to Microsoft's. Its netware has become the standard. Netware's dominance is unlikely to last a decade, as Microsoft's MS-DOS has done. By the mid- dle of next year. Microsoft has promised to launch a product called Windows NT (for \"new technology\") to compete with Netware. Meanwhile Taligent, a joint venture established by Apple and IBM, is also working on an operating system that will run both on networks and on stand-alone machines. And many people in the industry believe that some version of Unix will ultimately prevail. In December Novell bought Unix Systems Laboratories from AT&T and 11 minority shareholders, with the obvious intent of making Unix an alternative standard to whatever is offered by Microsoft., 16641=Joseph Farrell and Garth Saloner, Standardization, Compatibility, and Innovation, Rand J. of Econ., Spring 1985, 13015=Amy Bernstein, Microsoft Goes Online, U.S. News & World Report, Nov. 21, 1994, at 84, 12080=Quote of the Week, InformationWeek, Aug. 1, 1994, 101952=Even if Microsoft's initial monopoly was lawfully obtained, its enormous market power (and particularly the power to leverage into related markets) comes from its installed base in operating systems. That installed base, according to the Complaint, was procured as a result of anticompetitive practices. Indeed, Microsoft's installed base of operating system users has increased more than six-fold (from 18 to 120 million) since 1988, when the company began its anticompetitive practices. Microsoft has used its monopoly and its installed base in a classically predatory manner. It has used its monopoly revenues in one market to drive competitors out of other markets. It has also used its operating system installed base in a predatory manner to \"tip\" adjacent competitive markets in the direction of its own product in those markets, to the detriment of competitors., 824604=They had agreed to a telephone conference on July 11, but Bingaman was not betting on a happy ending. \"I had to play out the hand,\" she said. \"I figured, if it works, great; and if not, we gave it our best try.\", 206218=19 Ron White, Microsoft Gives the New Word, PC Week, Oct. 20, 1987, at 95., 327655=Cairo's Object File System will provide many core functions that users currently think of as database functions functions that can become part of a standard computing architecture that Microsoft controls from top to bottom.

Microsoft Corporation successfully used a variety of unlawful and \"anticompetitive\" practices to maintain its monopoly position in the market for \"operating systems\" for use with personal computers. As a result of these unlawful practices, Microsoft has been able to preclude any meaningful competition in the market while increasing the installed base of Microsoft operating systems from well under 20 million in 1988 to approximately 120 million in 1994., 373221='Microsoft has used its monopoly power, in effect, to levy a 'tax' on PC manufacturers who would otherwise like to offer an alternative system,' said Bingaman. 'As a result, the ability of rival operating systems to compete has been impeded, innovation has been slowed and consumer choices have been limited.' She noted that Microsoft has maintained the price of its operating systems while the price of other components has fallen dramatically. Since 1988, Microsoft's share of the market has never dropped below 70 percent., 299448=One reason Microsoft draws so much criticism is simply that wherever it competes, it seems to play a particularly hard-core game of hardball. Take its dealings with Logitech Inc. Until last June, Logitech had a license to buy Microsoft Windows 3.0 at a discount, then sell it together with Logitech's mice. But Microsoft abruptly canceled the deal, saying that it was losing money on such \"bundles\" involving inexpensive hardware, according to Logitech President Pierluigi Zappacosta. Only Microsoft still continued to sell Windows bundled with its own mice--for about $10 more than Logitech had been charging.After Zappacosta publicized his situa- tion in September, Microsoft relented. But there was a catch: The new license fee would be 30% higher. Zappacosta says that priced him out of the market, depriving his company of about $20 million annually. Microsoft continues to sell its Windows-and-mouse bundle. Says Zappacosta: \"Microsoft is extremely aggressive in using everything it can to its advantage.\" Microsoft denies that it forced Logitech out of the market but declines to discuss its pricing., 187779=Had the Justice Department sought to prevent Microsoft from leveraging its installed base of \"locked-in\" operating system users, its position would have found support in the case law.

Take the case of Adobe Systems Inc., maker of software that controls how computer printers produce typefaces. In September, 1989, Microsoft and Apple Computer Inc. said they would jointly develop a rival product. Adobe's stock fell 20% in one day, and for the next nine months the company spent 90% of its time answering customer's questions and \"fighting vaporware,\" says Chairman John E. Warnock.

Innov. New Techn., 1990, 103397=As used in this brief, \"leverage\" means that Microsoft uses the installed base in a market it dominates (for example, the operating system) to create an installed base in a new market (for example, desktop applications). It uses predatory subsidization, and both marketing and technological linkages, to accomplish leverage, as explained in greater detail in the succeeding pages. For the sake of easy example, Microsoft's horizontal tie-ins within, a single layer represent the most trivial example of its marketing strategy. Thus, Microsoft has trundled for sale a number of desktop applications (under the name, the \"Microsoft Office\"), putting companies like Lotus, WordPerfect and Borland at a competitive disadvantage. Carole Patton, Bundles Are Bad News, Computerworld, Nov. 14, 1994, at 57 (Ex. 8).

After all, the operating system for the server side of Microsoft's home-to-business server is Windows NT. Why have a different business server operating system?

What really stirs fresh fear and loathing in the computer business, however, is Windows 95. Microsoft plans to begin shipping the upgrade of Windows by mid-1995, and the industry already is complaining about the software giant's pricing and marketing plans for the software. Computer makers, for example, have been startled to learn that they will be asked to swallow a huge price hike for their use of Windows 95--to as much as $70 per pc, vs. roughly $35 today. At the same time, Microsoft has established more rigorous technical requirements for hardware and software makers who want to claim their products are compatible with Windows. \"Prices are going up and terms are becoming more restrictive,\" says John B. Landry, senior vice-president at Lotus Development Corp., 205430=16 Indeed, in 1990 Microsoft began to bundle its application products together into so-called \"suites.\" These mites are the fastest growing segment of the applications market, and Microsoft commands more than 85% of the suite market.

When the Justice Dept. began its antitrust suit in 1969, IBM's hold on the mainframe market made it seem invincible. By the time federal prosecutors withdrew their suit in 1982, however, the market had taken care of the problem: New technologies such as minicomputers and PCs had made IBM's near-monopoly in mainframes largely irrelevant., 749220=[D] Figure 1: Licenses of 32-Bit Operating Systems Shipped in 1993 (thousands of units), 487035=The constant price-cutting by other PC makers eventually made Apple's strategy untenable. Alarmed by Apple's shrinking market share, Hoh Sculley, its chief executive, reversed the company's direction in 1990, slashing prices, cutting costs and pushing new versions of its computers out of the door faster. \"We realised that we didn't have a survivable company,\" he explains. Apple's market share has recovered. Mr Sculley claims that it is now the world's biggest manufacturer of personal computers.

In this view, perturbations or temporary shifts--such as the oil shock of 1973 or the stock, market crash of 1987--are quickly negated by the opposing forces they elicit. Given future technological possibilities, one should in theory be able to forecast accurately the path of the economy as a smoothly shifting solution to the analytical equations governing prices and quantities of goods. History, in this view, is not terribly important; It merely delivers the economy to its inevitable equilibrium., 679892=Despite the skepticism. Microsoft's competitors may have their best chance in years to challenge Bill Gates's desktop domination. After a lengthy investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission (the executive body that governs the European Community), Justice Department officials announced in July that Microsoft had agreed to end its \"illegal monopolistic practices\" and stop using \"unfair contracts that choked off competition and preserved its monopoly\" in the PC operating system market., 818647=Copyright 1994 The Washington Post The Washington Post, 478225=IBM has already, made wrenching changes, cutting its workforce by a quarter to 300,000 and reducing manufacturing capacity by 40% since 1986. This year it is cuing another 25.000 people. It has also reorganised its business five times over the same period. In December 1991 it announced the most drastic reorganisation of all. the division of the company into 13 autonomous businesses, each with its own balance sheet, profit and loss account and financial targets. These businesses are supposed to establish an internal marks, with prices equivalent to those offered by outsiders, which should expose hidden subsidies and obvious laggards. Whether it will make ISM as a whole more competitive is debatable. \"Markets and companies are very different things,\" says David Teece, a professor at Haas School of Business at the University of California's Berkeley campus. \"ISM may not get the full benefits of either.\", 740564=W.

In the real world, if several similar-size firms entered a market at the same time, small fortuitous events--unexpected orders, chance meetings with buyers, managerial whims--would help determine which ones achieved early sales and, over time, which firm dominated. Economic activity is quantized by individual transactions that are too small to observe, and these small \"random\" events can accumulate and become magnified by positive feedbacks so as to determine the eventual outcome. These facts suggested that situations dominated by increasing returns should be modeled not as static, deterministic problems as dynamic processes based on random events and natural positive feedbacks, or nonlinearities., 741709=LENGTH: 1774 words, 172349=Second, while there are benefits to vertical and horizontal integration that Microsoft will point out, there are also very substantial costs. The enterprise server market, for example, is currently organized into a number of horizontal layers, each of which is characterized by strong competition. Generally speaking, consumers prefer this horizontal competition. See, e.g., The Economist, Feb. 27-Mar, 5, 1993, supra, at 11 (Ex. 14). Microsoft is attempting to impose a verticality on the enterprise market so that it can extract monopoly rents., 691013=By 1985, these practices had already had their intended effect: making Microsoft's operating system the de facto PC standard. The present source of Microsoft's domination in the PC world derives from the status as the standard- holders, not the practices the Justice Department condemned and which will now be prohibited under the settlement., 753656=It will be divided into two optimized versions--one for advanced desktop users (NT Workstation) and one for servers (NT Server). This division will mark the beginning of separate, but still binary compatible code bases that are targeted at separate markets.

Robin Cowan of New York University has shown that a series of trivial circumstances locked virtually the en??e U.S. nuclear industry into light water. Light-water reactors were originally adapted from highly compact units designed to propel nuclear submarines. The role of the U.S. Navy in early reactor-construction contracts, efforts by the National Security Council to get a reactor--any reactor-- working on land in the wake of the 1957 Sputnik launch as well as the predilections of some key officials all acted to favor the early development of Light-water reactors. Construction experience led to improved light-water designs and. by the mid-1960's, fixed the industry's path. Whether other designs would, in fact, have been superior in the long run is open to question, but much of the engineering literature suggests that high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors would have been better., 2806=FEB 14 1995, 263776=There's no doubt about it. Microsoft Corp. wants to dominate the world--the personal computer software world, that is. And it isn't very far from doing so: It already supplies the core software for just about all of the world's 25 million-plus IBM PCs and their clones. It has done well, too, in many sectors of the huge market for PC applications programs--spreadsheets, word processors, and the like. All in all, it's the leader in total PC software sales--Wall Street expects revenues of $1.1 billion for the year ending next June, up 40% from the year before., 11462=Computerworld, Dec. 6, 1993 (International Data Corp.

Microsoft is a victory, for Microsoft. Directly contradicting the previous day's headline, a New York Times (July 18) news analysis by John Markoff spoke of \"Microsoft's Barely Limited Future\": \"Rather than reining in the Microsoft Corporation, the consent de- cree... frees the company to define computer industry's ground rules through the rest of the decade.\" The Wall Street Journal had a similar take: \"A Winning Deal: Microsoft Will Remain Dominant Despite Pact In Antitrust Dispute.\" According to the Journal Gates -has just won big again, this time by letting the Justice Department rake in a small pot while his company retains the power to dominate the nation's desktops., 25813=This Court has been asked to endorse the proposed Consent Decree between the Department of Justice and Microsoft without being provided with any of the information upon which a meaningful determination under the Tunney Act could be based. Thus, for example, the Department's investigation ostensibly inquired regarding \"alleged false product preannouncements\" by Microsoft. 59 Fed. Reg. 59,426, 59,427 (Nov. 17, 1994). At the September 29, 1994 hearing on this matter, the Court referred to this issue, noting that in the book Hard Drive,2 Microsoft was said \"time after time\" to predatorially preannounce products \"with the intent [to] freeze other people from coming out with their product.\" Tr. of Status Call, Sept. 29, 1994, at 16:21-22.

Rev., May 1985, at 332, 177247=According to the Government's complaint, Microsoft used anticompetitive licensing practices from at least 1988 to 1994. As noted earlier, during that period, Microsoft maintained its greater than 90 % share of the X86 operating system market.101 thereby increasing its installed base six-fold.102 Contrary to the assertions of the Assistant Attorney General, the relief proposed by the Government, a cessation of further anticompetitive practices, will not restore competition to the X86 operating system market because of the \"network effects\" present in the market., 488438=Mr Sculley is already looking far beyond any of these venues. \"In five years Apple will be heavily into services, software, and systems integration. The wars today are all about hardware prices. Microsoft's monopoly of the system software. Intel's control of microprocessor technology; that's all going to be ancient history,\" he says. The future he predicts will be one in which people will have access to all forms of information-new, television, business data-wherever and whenever they want, using hand-held \"personal digital assistnats\", a kind of computerised mobile telephone. Apple announced the first tamily of these, called the Newton, last year, but has yet to bring any of them to market. By 2000, says Mr Sculley, the consumer-electronics, television, telecommmunications, entertainment and news industries will have merged into a single market, with sales of $3.5 trillion a year. Apple will thrive in this market, he claims, because it knows better than most firms how to make complex technology easy for ordinary people to use., 22451=Gina Smith, Merger Misgivings: Will Intuit Go 'Soft?, S.F.

In analyzing the strength of the Department's case against Microsoft, Hard Drive identified Microsoft's weakness in application programs as the principal reason (apart from the competition provided by products such as DR DOS) why Microsoft's dominant position arguably would not hurt consumers. With respect to application programs, the authors in 1992 argued that, 608480=We are not as far along on the response to TurboC because we are further from product announcement. I developed a rollout plan for QuickC and CS that focused on minimizing Borland's first mover advantage by preannouncing with an aggressive communication campaign. I determined that we should preannounce in ??ty June because that is when editorial should be light and it is when BillG speaks at BCS. At SteveSn's suggestion. I worked with KathrynH to make the BCS announcement a rent extravaganza. I also proposed a new early beta program for QuickC that would help us to get press coverage sooner after shipment. I chaired a meeting with BillG. JonS. and steveB to run through the plan. While we were well prepared to discuss QuickC they were more interested in discussing how we would protect our high end product. This meeting would have gone better if I had met with Bill first to determine an appropriate agenda. We still need to figure out how to protect the high end product from price cutters. We should be prepared to offer a stripped town high-end conipiler (i.e., no CodeView, and no QuickC) at a lawer price point if TurboC begins to cannibalize the high end., 430060=While many computer firms sacked thousands of workers and last huge amounts of money last year, others thrived despite price wars and recession. On the day in August 1992 that Wang filed for chapter-11 bankruptcy, Dell, a personal-computer maker, reported quarterly sales up 129% and net profits up 77%. In 1992 some companies, such as Apple and Compaq, which looked doomed because of the price wars ravaging the PC market, staged stunning comebacks (though they too had to cut)obs and other costs). Price-cutting spread from hardware to software. And yet profits at Microsoft, the world's biggest personal-computer software company, leapt 53%. The computer business still boasts many of the world's fastest-growing and mast profitable firms. But it now has some of the world's biggest loss-makers too. Today's industry offers other remarkable contrasts. Despite the fact that its overall profitability has fallen so sharply (see chart 1). hordes of new competitors continue to enter almost every part of it. And far from slowing the pace of innovation, as might be expected, hard times seem to have quickened it. An unprecedented number of new products came to market last year. This stream is about to become a flood. With chip technology improving faster than ever, a plethora of new products will reach the market over the next few years: pen-based PCs, hand-held computing and communication devices, ever more powerful versions of today's desktop and notebook computers, sophisticated network and database software. cheaper and fancier supercomputers., 19025=Yael Li-Ron, PC DOS 6.3: DOS and DOS: Separated At Birth, PC-Computing, July 1994, at 94, 19997=Charles R.

Microsoft continued these practices through mid-1994, and, as noted previously, it was during this period that Microsoft was able to increase its installed base by more than 100 million users.65 As the preceding section explains, it is the size of Microsoft's installed base, rather than merely its market share, that determines the company's true market power. Accordingly. through practices that the Government has identified as \"anticompetitive,\" Microsoft has increased its market power many fold., 15652=Cara A.

Business Week, 174459=Nor is it altogether clear that vertical integration will necessarily produce efficiencies (that translate into lower prices) over, say, horizontal competition at each layer. There is not yet empirical research on point, but there is certainly theoretical research suggesting that there are benefits to horizontal competition in the vertical layers.100 Hence, while there is theoretical literature that documents the efficiency of the horizontal competition model, the real challenge is maintaining the horizontal model in the world. Increasing return economics indicates that there is no reason to believe that the market, as currently structured, will choose the \"best\" product at a particular level. Rather. there is every reason to believe that Microsoft. through leverage from control of the operating system, will be able to impose verticality, with its associated costs -- notwithstanding the fact that users appear to desire the benefits of horizontal competition. See, e.g., The Economist, Feb. 27-Mar. 5, 1993, supra (Ex. 14). In short, Government intervention is necessary merely to provide a sufficiently level playing field for the horizontal model to have a reasonable chance of succeeding., 566532=Because the relevant act is broad, the U.S. Supreme Court m 1972 clarified the definition of unfair competition. The Court upheld an FTC policy against practices that are: 1. prohibited by \"common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness\"; 2. \"immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous\": or 3. cause \"substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen).\", 221770=70 See Cara A. Cunningham, IBM and Microsoft Wage Open Doc vs. OLE Find, InfoWorld, Aug. 15, 1994, at 25 (Microsoft has an \"army of evangelists.., that goes out and sells the [OLE] technology and swarms over developers\")., 114989=Microsoft's strategy, which was based at the outset on an installed base created in part through anticompetitive licensing practices, succeeded in monopolizing the desktop OS and threatening desktop applications. Once Microsoft had control of the operating system, which is the key architectural technology for desktop computing, it was able to maintain its share, even with an inferior product. The introduction of DR DOS from Novell showed that Microsoft had failed to keep MS DOS abreast of leading technology.66 Yet Novell's compatible offering in the DOS market (DR DOS) stopped selling when Microsoft made it clear that Microsoft would create versions of Windows that were incompatible with DR DOS. It is common for \"better\" products to fail if a competitor controls the architecture in which the product operates. See Charles R. Morris and Charles H. Ferguson, Harv. Bus.

Firms must keep a close eye on the actions of others, even those with whom they have no formal alliance or do not compete. Most firms depend on those In other layers of the industry, to succeed. If a firm stumbles in one layer, it can deal a mortal blow to firms in other layers. In the 1980s Compaq owed much of its extraordinary success in the market for assembled PCs to Intel's willingness to provide it with carly supplies of its latest microprocessor. But when new RISC microprocessors designed by Run and others looked as if they would leave Intel's chips Par behind. Compaq had no choice but to join Microsoft, and 19 other firms whose products depended on Intel's chips, in a consortium tailed ACE assembled to search For an alternative. Alarmed. Intel accelerated plans to bring out a new generation of microprocessors and eventually persuaded ACE's members that it could keep up with RISC technology. In late 1992 ACE was dispanded. Similarly. Lotus bet that IBM would succeed with OS/2 after its split with Microsoft. When sales of Windows took off and those of OS/2 sputtered.

For example, Microsoft based its own application programs on components m the operating system that it had unique or early access to. Microsoft claimed it was \"open,\" but actually used hidden features and functions to gain a competitive advantage. Brian Livingston. InfoWorld, Nov. 16. 1992, supra, at 98 (Ex. 19). That is, Microsoft provided a proprietary architecture with a supposedly \"open\" system. See Charles R. Morris and Charles H. Ferguson, Harv. Bus. Rev.. Mar. 1993, supra. The most well-known such example involves Microsoft's \"OLE\" (object linking and embedding) standard., 141384=Microsoft also enhances its power in the server applications layer by horizontally bundling these products into a suite (the \"BackOffice\") in the same way Microsoft bundled desktop applications into a suite. Just as with the desktop applications, there is also vertical leverage to enforce the horizontal bundle by making all server applications OLE-enabled. See Stuart J.

While other software makers were announcing shrinking market share, losses, or layoffs in 1992, Microsoft tacked on $975 million in calendar-year revenues--more than 90% of all the revenue growth in the PC software industry, according to preliminary Dataquest figures. Microsoft's share of the world desktop PC software industry reached 44% last year, Dataquest figures. And if, as analysts project, Microsoft sales rise 36%, to $3.75 billion, in the fiscal year ending June 30, Microsoft will have more revenues than its seven closest publicly held rivals combined.

If a user wanted to run the competitive Borland program, it had to buy the debug kernel separately from Microsoft, at a price Microsoft set to make the Borland product less competitive. Microsoft even conspicuously advertised the fact that its own product was cheaper than the Borland product because the user had to buy the debug kernel separately from Microsoft.

Even if IBM had not become such a dominant firm, a small group of large firms would prob- ably have controlled the industry in any case. There are two reasons for believing this. First, computers were the most complicated machines ever made, in Pact, they were so complicated that even individual machines were called \"systems\". And second, though the Industry was large in revenue terms, relatively few machines were sold each year. As recently as 1980, fewer than 10,000 mainframes and 105,000 minicomputers were sold worldwide each year. Such volumes are significant for suppliers of capital equipment, but they are minuscule compared with those of the car or other consumer industries. Customers were reluctant to buy these cranky machines from anyone but large, established suppliers. So newcomers had a hard time breaking into the lousiness., 217296=54 For early examples in the economics literature, see Joseph Farrell and Garth Saloner, Standardization, Compatibility, and Innovation, Rand J. of Economics, Spring 1985 and Michael Katz and Carl Shapiro, Amer.

How IBM got this monopoly was the subject of much conjecture and years of litigation, but is irrelevant for our purposes. What is relevant is the fact that IBM, in its rush to get out a personal computer, did not leverage its own power from mainframes. Rather, it procured chips from Intel and an operating system from Microsoft (\"DOS\"), thereby transferring its market power to them as the market for personal computers expanded to displace mainframes and IBM's imprimatur established a standard.

Whatever the case, Microsoft's tactics have strained relations even with partners. This fall, John Warnock, chief executive of Adobe Systems Inc., had an emotional, public falling out with Gates. Adobe's top product called Postscript, is a key program for desktop publishing. Earlier this year, Apple, Adohe's best customer, said it would replace Postscript in Apple computers. Microsoft continued to do business with Adobe. Then, in September, Apple and Microsoft surprised Warnock by announcing at an industry conference that they would collaborate in competing with Adobe. Says Warnock: \"We used to be a strong ally of Microsoft.\" Now, \"it's easier to help their competitors.\", 491663=But the product map of the future could just as easily mean a collection of tough new competitors for the computer industry. Particularly ominous is the vast area covered by consumer electronics. Japanese firms such as Sony, Matshshita and Sharp are veterans at miniaturisation, low-cost manufacturing and selling huge volumes of low-margin products to a global market. To manufacture its Newton products, Apple has already had to turn to Sharp. Publishers and news services such as Reuters, Dow Jones and Associated Press are unlikely to let computer firms into their business without a fight. And the biggest winners of all may be the telephone companies and cellular-phone operators. They already make more money transmitting faxes than the firms which make fax machines. In November AT&T bought a 33% stake in McCaw, America's biggest cellular operator, and it already owns stakes in EO, a start-up company making mobile, hand-held computers, and General Magic, an Apple spin-off developing software for such devices., 834002=SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1994, 227988=96 All of these problems are discussed in Rory O'Connor, San Jose Mercury News, Nov. 13, 1994, supra, at 1A, 28A (Ex. 34)., 269921=Starting in early 1983, Microsoft tried to supplement MS-DOS with Windows, a program that makes PCs act much like Apple's Macintosh.

They say Microsoft also gave them mixed signals: It positioned Windows as a program mainly for low-end PCS, while it worked on a more ad- vanced--but incompatible--operating system called OS/2 for more powerful computers. And IBM threw its weight behind OS/2., 22068=Andrew Schulman, Microsoft's Grip On Software Tightened By Antitrust Deal, Dr. Dobb's Journal of Software Tools, Oct. 1994, at 143}",
    "textBeforeTable": "The following vendors are writing applications for Windows 95, but they have different plans for Windows NT. NT = no ties Developing for next generation or Windows may mean running on NT By William Brandel and Ed Scannell While software developers are enthusiastically preparing their wares for Microsoft Corp.'s rollout of Windows 95 next year, they are not thrilled about the strings attached to Windows NT. A number of software developers last week expressed both reluctance and frustration over their efforts to codevelop Windows 95 applications that also run on Windows NT. Microsoft has required that software developers who want to use the Windows 95 logo meet a standard of seven different features, one of which is that the application also run on Windows NT [CW, Nov. 14]. A number of vendors said developing for the two operating systems is difficult, as each targets a different market. Windows 95 is the 32-bit version of Windows mostly likely to run on Intel Corp.-based desktops, while Windows NT targets applications that have typically run on Unix platforms, such as server and workstation applications. ``We are not going to delay our Windows 95 applications so that we can deliver Windows NT applications at the same time,'' said Peter Cohen, a spokesman for Lotus Development Corp.'s spreadsheet business. ``We just don't see the demand for",
    "textAfterTable": "This sentiment was echoed by a number of developers, including officials at WordPerfect, the Novell, Inc. Applications Group. WordPerfect is trying to meet the NT compatibility requirement. ``Windows NT has [more than a dozen] different APIs, a different shared memory space and different bugs to test for,'' said Gary Gibb, director of development for WordPerfect's PerfectOffice. ``You have to go through your entire testing cycle on a number of different hardware configurations and then repeat these tests on NT. And none of this makes the Windows 95 applications run any better.'' However, while Microsoft has listed running on NT as a Windows 95 compatibility standard, it has also left the door open for vendors to opt out. Microsoft will allow certain vendors to ``degrade gracefully,'' or choose not to comply with some of the compatibility requirements, if the applications do not mislead the end user into believing certain functions are available when they are not, said Brad Struss, manager of Win32 developer relations at Microsoft. ``We'll let some vendors gray out an item menu if they don't support a feature,'' Struss said.~~ He added that Microsoft's aim is to ensure that users do not run into application errors from trying to run a Windows 95 application on NT. As for the alleged difficulty in developing to the Windows NT application programming interfaces (API), Struss blamed confusion over which API developers should be using.
