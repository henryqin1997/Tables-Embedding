These can be the ionomer resins described above, combined in a weight ratio which preferably is within the range of 10:90 to 90:10 parts of high and low acid ionomer resins., 40872=This was addressed by Spalding Sports Worldwide, Inc., the assignee of the present invention, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,431,193 where a multi-layered golf ball is produced by initially molding a first cover layer on a spherical core and then adding a second layer. The first layer is comprised of a hard, high flexural modulus resinous material such as type 1605 Surlyn\ufffd (now designated Surlyn\ufffd 8940). Type 1605 Surlyn (Surlyn\ufffd 8940) is a sodium ion based low acid (less than or equal to 15 weight percent methacrylic acid) ionomer resin having a flexural modulus of about 51,000 psi. An outer layer of a comparatively soft, low flexural modulus resinous material such as type 1855 Surlyn\ufffd (now designated Surlyn\ufffd 9020) is molded over the inner cover layer. Type 1855 Surlyn\ufffd (Surlyn\ufffd 9020) is a zinc ion based low acid (10 weight percent methacrylic acid) ionomer resin having a flexural modulus of about 14,000 psi., 101443=More particularly, several new metal cation neutralized high acid ionomer resins have been produced by neutralizing, to various extents, high acid copolymers of an alpha-olefin and an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid with a wide variety of different metal cation salts. This discovery is the subject matter of U.S. application Ser. No. 081493,089, incorporated herein by reference. It has been found that numerous new metal cation neutralized high acid ionomer resins can be obtained by reacting a high acid copolymer (i.e., a copolymer containing greater than 16% by weight acid, preferably from about 17 to about 25 weight percent acid, and more preferably about 20 weight percent acid), with a metal cation salt capable of ionizing or neutralizing the copolymer to the extent desired (i.e., from about 10% to 90%)., 80756=Further, Surlyn\ufffd 8162 is a zinc cation ionomer resin containing approximately 20% by weight (i.e., 18.5-21.5% weight) methacrylic acid copolymer that has been 30-70% neutralized. Surlyn\ufffd 8162 is currently commercially available from DuPont., 65922=The inner layer compositions include the high acid ionomers such as those developed by E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company under the trademark \u201cSurlyn\ufffd\u201d and by Exxon Corporation under the trademark \u201cEscor\ufffd\u201d or trade name \u201clotek\u201d, or blends thereof. Examples of compositions which may be used as the inner layer herein are set forth in detail in a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/174,765, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/776,803 filed Oct. 15, 1991, and Ser. No. 081493,089, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 07/981,751, which in turn is a continuation of Ser. No. 07/901,660 filed Jun. 19, 1992, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Of course, the inner layer high acid ionomer compositions are not limited in any way to those compositions set forth in the noted applications., 33482=This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/926,872 filed on Sep. 10, 1997, which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/631,613 filed on Apr. 10, 1996, now U.S. Pat.

This application also claims priority from U.S. provisional application serial No. 60/042,120, filed Mar. 28, 1997; provisional application Ser. No. 60/042,430, filed Mar. 28, 1997; and U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/042,439 filed Mar. 28, 1997., 181955=Examples of the more pertinent acrylic acid based hard ionomer resin suitable for use in the present outer cover composition sold under the \u201clotek\u201d trade name by the Exxon Corporation include lotek 8000, 8010, 8020, 8030, 7030, 7010, 7020, 1002, 1003, 959 and 960. The physical properties of lotek 959 and 960 are shown above. The typical properties of the remainder of these and other lotek hard ionomers suited for use in formulating the outer layer cover composition are set forth below in Table 9:, 64958=The inner cover layer is harder than the outer cover layer and generally has a thickness in the range of 0.01 to 0.10 inches, preferably 0.03 to 0.07 inches for a 1.68 inch ball and 0.05 to 0.10 inches for a 1.72 inch (or more) ball. The core and inner cover layer together form an inner ball having a coefficient of restitution of 0.780 or more and more preferably 0.790 or more, and a diameter in the range of 1.48-1.66 inches for a 1.68 inch ball and 1.50-1.70 inches for a 1.72 inch (or more) ball. The inner cover layer has a Shore D hardness of 60 or more. It is particularly advantageous if the golf balls of the invention have an inner layer with a Shore D hardness of 65 or more, and preferably 70 or more. The above-described characteristics of the inner cover layer provide an inner ball having a PGA compression of 100 or less. It is found that when the inner ball has a PGA compression of 90 or less, excellent playability results., 152182=The outer layer in another embodiment of the invention includes a blend of a soft (low acid) ionomer resin with a small amount of a hard (high acid) ionomer resin. A low modulus ionomer suitable for use in the outer layer blend has a flexural modulus measuring from about 1,000 to about 10,000 psi, with a hardness of about 20 to about 40 on the Shore D scale. A high modulus ionomer herein is one which measures from about 15,000 to about 70,000 psi as measured in accordance with ASTM method D-790. The hardness may be defined as at least 50 on the Shore D scale as measured in accordance with ASTM method D-2240., 81016=Examples of the high acid acrylic acid based ionomers suitable for use in the present invention also include the Escor\ufffd or lotek high acid ethylene acrylic acid ionomers produced by Exxon such as Ex 1001, 1002, 959, 960, 989, 990, 1003, 1004, 993, 994. In this regard, Escor\ufffd or lotek 959 is a sodium ion neutralized ethylene-acrylic neutralized ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer. According to Exxon, loteks 959 and 960 contain from about 19.0 to 21.0% by weight acrylic acid with approximately 30 to about 70 percent of the acid groups neutralized with sodium and zinc ions, respectively. The physical properties of these high acid acrylic acid based ionomers are set forth in Tables 1 and 2 as follows:, 320291=Generally, the inner cover layer which is molded over the core, or preferably a dual core component, is about 0.01 inches to about 0.10 inches in thickness, preferably about 0.03-0.07 inches thick. The inner ball which includes the core and inner cover layer preferably has a diameter in the range of 1.25 to 1.60 inches. The outer cover layer is about 0.01 inches to about 0.10 inches in thickness. Together, the core, the inner cover layer and the outer cover layer combine to form a ball having a diameter of 1.680 inches or more, the minimum diameter permitted by the rules of the United States Golf Association and weighing no more than 1.62 ounces., 222515=The density-increasing fillers for use in the invention preferably have a specific gravity in the range of 1.0-20. The density-reducing fillers for use in the invention preferably have a specific gravity of 0.06-1.4, and more preferably 0.06-0.90. The flex modulus increasing fillers have a reinforcing or stiffening effect due to their morphology, their interaction with the resin, or their inherent physical properties. The flex modulus reducing fillers have an opposite effect due to their relatively flexible properties compared to the matrix resin. The melt flow index increasing fillers have a flow enhancing effect due to their relatively high melt flow versus the matrix. The melt flow index decreasing fillers have an opposite effect due to their relatively low melt flow index versus the matrix., 162318=In addition, test data indicates that lotek 7520 resins have Short D hardnesses of about 32 to 36 (per ASTM D-2240), melt flow indexes of 3\ufffd0.5 g/10 min (at 190\ufffd C. per ASTM D-1288), and a flexural modulus of about 2500-3500 psi (per ASTM D-790). Furthermore, testing by an independent testing laboratory by pyrolysis mass spectrometry indicates that lotek 7520 resins are generally zinc salts of a terpolymer of ethylene, acrylic acid, and methyl acrylate.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon a reading and understanding the preceding detailed description. It is intended that the invention be construed as including all such modifications and alterations in so far as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. The resulting golf ball produced from the hard inner layer and the relatively softer, low flexural modulus outer layer provide for an improved multi-layer golf ball having a unique dual core configuration which provides for desirable coefficient of restitution and durability properties while at the same time offering the feel and spin characteristics associated with soft balata and balata-like covers of the prior art. After molding, the golf balls produced may undergo various further processing steps such as buffing, painting and marking as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,911,451, herein incorporated by reference. In compression molding, the inner cover composition is formed via injection at about 380\ufffd F. to about 450\ufffd F. into smooth surfaced hemispherical shells which are then positioned around the core in a mold having the desired inner cover thickness and subjected to compression molding at 200\ufffd to 300\ufffd F. for about 2 to 10 minutes, followed by cooling at 500 to 70\ufffd F. for about 2 to 7 minutes to fuse the shells together to form a unitary intermediate ball.
