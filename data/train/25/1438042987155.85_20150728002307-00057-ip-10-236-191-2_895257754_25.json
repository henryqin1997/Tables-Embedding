The large number of out-of-country programs creates immersive opportunities for the language Majors, and the Engineering program is ABET accredited, rare in private colleges. An engineer, I live in the Mathematics and Sciences. My experience with Calculus was educational, reviewing the basics in a comfortable way, like learning to swim. While my required religion course (it is a Christian Reformed campus) was a school of Sharks added, the Professor did everything to answer my questions. Every professor I have had has been understanding and helpful. Tutoring is available and free for every student. The Honors program differs from the University normal. Opposed to a single \u201cHonors\u201d curriculum tied to a building (though there is an honors floor in the Van Reken Dorm), an \u201cHonors Contract\u201d can be negotiated with most professors. This allows for any student in any major to graduate with Honors, having gained additional experience in their field. The inclusion of a Month-long term in January, \u201cInterim term\u201d, is a welcome break, giving students the chance to take a course outside their major for fun and credit. I feel that at the end of four years I will be prepared for my career field., 196555=One tradition I like is the canoe race where your team builds a canoe out of cardboard and race other teams around the Sem Pond by the presidents house. Although the best tradition I've heard of at Calvin is the Sem Pond jump. Which is when people who are planning on graduating from Calvin in four years jump into the frozen pond every January they are here and after the fourth year jump you win the Golden Knight Towel., 97410=Downtown grand rapids is just a short ride away by car or bus. Art prize is in september where on the weekends there is always something to do. The concerts at calvin are great, they always have big bands coming into town and the discounted ticket prices are the bomb!, 190049=Calvin's a 10 minute run away from the Woodland Mall in Grand Rapids. ArtPrize goes on during September, and the Post Family Farm is close by for floor dates during October that include hay rides and apple cider. In the winter students can have snow fights or visit the nearby museums, and the Grand Rapids Symphony plays and students can get cheaper student passes ($5)., 127042=The first thing that comes to mind is: taking a polar dip in the Seminary pond in February. (Winter in Michigan), 111216=- the Moses statue which freshman will see at the beginning of the year. - Calvin Walks - a couple at Calvin is considered official if they walk around campus and visits certain locations. - Calvin has acronyms for everything! - Jumping in the Seminary pond in February - Chaos Day - Airband - Dance Guild, 189515=The Sem Pond Jump: every February, students jump into the seminary pond to earn bragging rights and a golden washcloth. If a student jumps all four years, s/he earns a golden towel! Chaos Day: In September, dorm students battle for bragging rights and compete in contests; the dorm with the most points wins and has bragging rights for the next year., 264207=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 154965=Register your car in August to get a $25 discount., 204266=-Calvin Walks are a thing amongst Calvin students in which you walk around campus with a girl/guy of your interest. -The Sem Pond Jump is done annually in February and if you do it for all four years, you get a golden towel., 132676=Every year around February they have a polar bear plug type event in the pond on campus. Students who do it all four years get a golden towel.}",
