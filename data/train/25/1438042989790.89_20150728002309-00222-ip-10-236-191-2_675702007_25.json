Mr. Nesci will continue in his role as OTA's chairman., 26830=In April, VimpelCom announced the sale by GTH of a 51% interest in Orascom Telecom Algerie SpA (\"OTA\" or \"Djezzy\") to the Fonds National d'Investissement (the \"FNI\"), the Algerian National Investment Fund, for a purchase consideration of USD 2.6 billion. OTA will distribute a dividend of USD 1.9 billion to GTH immediately prior to the closing of the transaction (\"Closing\"), which is expected to occur by the end of 2014. GTH and the FNI will enter into a shareholders agreement (\"the Shareholders Agreement\"), effective as of Closing, which will govern their relationship as shareholders in OTA going forward. GTH will continue to exercise operational control over OTA and, as a result, both GTH and VimpelCom will continue to fully consolidate OTA. This partnership with the FNI provides OTA with a strong and stable shareholder structure on which to build and strengthen its operations in Algeria.

Consequently, the Company has taken a one-off charge of USD 2.0 billion in its 2013 Financial Statements.

Although the improvements in customer perception are expected to become visible in the second half of this year, the Company expects that the pressure on results will continue for the remainder of 2014., 48838=Total revenue in 1Q14 was negatively impacted by the operational performance in Russia, the intense price competition in Italy particularly through the summer of 2013, regulatory and governmental actions in the Africa & Asia Business Unit, together with unstable macro-economic situations in Pakistan and Ukraine., 54159=Total revenue of the Ukraine Business Unit decreased 7% YoY to UAH 2.9 billion. Mobile service revenue declined 6% YoY to UAH 2.7 billion, primarily due to lower mobile voice revenue, partly offset by solid mobile data revenue growth of 15% YoY. Fixed-line service revenue declined 2% YoY due to a planned reduction in low margin transit revenue, but was partly offset by a 19% YoY growth in fixed residential broadband (FTTB) revenue. EBITDA decreased 8% YoY to UAH 1.4 billion mainly due to lower mobile service revenue, but EBITDA margin remained robust at 48.6%, down 0.4 percentage points YoY. Kyivstar's transformation program is delivering the first signs of improvement in performance and the Company expects a stable market position in 2014, but the environment is expected to remain challenging throughout 2014., 93894=In 1Q14, WIND continued to outperform its peers in what remains a challenging environment characterized by further mobile market contraction as a result of the intense price competition particularly in the summer of 2013. The competitive environment continued to stabilize during the first quarter of 2014 with certain operators removing their more aggressive promotions. As a result, gross additions in the market declined materially leading to a positive impact on churn. In this context, WIND maintained a stable customer market share despite the aggressive promotions of one competitor. The Company expects that the market will continue to be challenging for the remainder of the year., 51031=In Italy, WIND continued to outperform the wider market in what remains a challenging environment characterized by further mobile market contraction mainly as a result of the heavy price competition, particularly in the summer of 2013. The competitive environment continued to stabilize during the first quarter of 2014 with certain operators removing their more aggressive promotions. Mobile service revenue in 1Q14 decreased 11% to EUR 729 million driven by 2013 price competition, the MTR reduction impact and a material contraction of SMS revenues, in line with the development witnessed in most mature markets. Mobile broadband revenue increased 24% YoY to EUR 132 million and fixed broadband revenue increased 2% YoY to EUR 138 million. EBITDA declined organically 7% YoY to EUR 430 million mainly due to the pressure on service revenue, as a result of intense price competition and the MTR reduction, partially compensated by cost savings. As a result, EBITDA margin remained stable YoY at 37.6%. The Company expects that the market will continue to be challenging for the remainder of the year mainly as a result of continued impact from the intense price competition in the summer of 2013., 49947=The Russian Business Unit continued to see pressure on its results as the Company executes its next phase of the transition focusing on Customer Excellence and implementing a cultural transformation to a customer-centric organization. Revenue was down 6% YoY to RUB 66.1 billion, while mobile service revenue declined 3% YoY to RUB 52.4 billion. Mobile data revenue increased 22% YoY to RUB 8.8 billion. Mobile broadband customers in Russia increased 16% YoY to 3.2 million. EBITDA declined organically 9% YoY to RUB 26.5 billion due to the revenue decrease and the costs related to investments in the mobile data network and in owned monobrand stores.

Customers continued to be attracted to Beeline\u00b4s value proposition as a result of the ongoing transition to bundled tariff plans, as well as the introduction of regional offers in major cities with attractive on-net tariffs during 1Q14. In line with the agreed glide path of Mobile Termination Rates, the MTR was reduced by 15% at the beginning of 2014., 194687=31 December 2013 Revised1, 113106=CAPEX increased 610% YoY mainly due to the investments in the high-speed 3G network, following the lifting of the ban on 3G equipment in December 2013., 215787=1) The 2013 statement of financial position has been revised to reflect the resolution in Algeria and fixed assets write off to operating expenses in Uzbekistan, 31183=As previously disclosed, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and the Dutch public prosecutor's office are conducting investigations related to the Company's operations in Uzbekistan, including relations with Takilant Ltd. (\"Takilant\"). Takilant held a minority interest in VimpelCom's business in Uzbekistan from 2007 until 2009 when such minority interest was purchased by the Company pursuant to the exercise by Takilant of a put option. In addition, we had agreements with Takilant in the past relating to the acquisition of frequency spectrum and channels in Uzbekistan., 80991=Beeline continued its efforts to improve customer perception by introducing a new simplified tariff portfolio with competitive prices in combination with transparent services. This was supported by an attractive smartphone offering, underpinning the new customer value proposition. Beeline introduced the first smartphone on the market priced below RUB 500, in combination with the new bundle tariff plan \"ALL!\". In addition, the Company continued with its new content and spam policy, filtering SMS spam from short numbers and offering free Beeline antivirus protection.

This milestone paves the way to launch 3G services in Pakistan during 2014 and solidifies the Group's commitment to the Pakistani market and to maintaining Mobilink's market leadership position., 95853=Mobile ARPU declined 12% to EUR 11 driven by the decline in voice ARPU caused by the 2013 competitive pressure coupled with the increased number of \"data only\" SIM cards. Mobile data ARPU increased 2% YoY and now generates 38% of total mobile ARPU., 29609=In April, Mobilink, the indirect wholly owned Pakistani subsidiary, was awarded 2x10 MHz spectrum in the 2100 MHz band. The total price for the spectrum was USD 0.3 billion and the license is valid for 15 years., 154111=Mobile service revenue in Armenia decreased 4% YoY to AMD 5.5 billion in 1Q14, as a result of an 8% YoY decline in its mobile customer base to 0.7 million, due to strong competition. Mobile ARPU increased 6% YoY to AMD 2,589 as a result of the value for money proposition. Fixed service revenue declined 4% due to decline in voice revenue and a 3% YoY loss of customers. EBITDA declined 10% YoY and EBITDA margin decreased 2.5 percentage points to 36.6% mainly due to the decrease in mobile voice revenue. Competition is expected to remain strong following the introduction of MNP in April 2014., 329204=4Q13 As reported on March 6, 2014\u00a0, 173617=2:00 pm CET investor and analyst conference call US call-in number: +1 (877) 616-4476 Confirmation Code: 33247951, 343252=FY13 As reported on March 6, 2014\u00a0, 173994=The conference call replay and the slide presentations webcast will be available until May 21, 2014.
