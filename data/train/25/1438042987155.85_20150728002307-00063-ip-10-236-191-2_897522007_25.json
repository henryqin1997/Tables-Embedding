There are always people walking around, the library is open and filled with students, the rec center still has classes going, and best of all, campus security and Portland police are constantly patrolling so I see them often. Over all? Extremely safe!, 614474=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 47023=Apply very early! The application process takes a few weeks and the deadline for all scholarships is February 1st. Take the time to apply over winter break (or even November/December); even if you don't decide to go, it will save you a potential headache., 282083=5th and Washington, Downtown Portland Or,,, 11:11 Gallery, 119198=Tuition has raised amazingly high since I started going to PSU in 2003 and managed to get two bachelors degrees. Students are nickeled and dimed for miscellaneous fees, student rec fees, and stuff that has to do with PSU's constant expansion. We don't see what the fees actually go to. If I could get some of the fee money back, I would be happy., 125777=Plenty of clubs and events on campus, especially during the spring and early fall. A farmers market is held on the weekends in the middle of campus starting in March until mid-November.}",

Tips for prospective students Apartments in the city are expensive to plan ahead. The grocery stores are also expensive. Textbooks are expensive try to avoid the PSU Bookstore. Don't expect much school spirit at this school. Join a club or organization so that you don't fell disconnected. Bang for the buck I think the college is worth the money all though PSU doesn't offer as much financial",
