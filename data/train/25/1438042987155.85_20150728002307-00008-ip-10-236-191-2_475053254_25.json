HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners-Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language\u20142.0\u201d (November 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Berners-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP/1.1: HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)., 48787=Compact disks were first introduced in the music recording industry in 1982, and now account for 43% of all recorded music sales. In the United States alone, over three hundred million compact disks are sold annually, with a retail value of over three billion dollars, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. The most prevalent format for recording multimedia events onto such disks is Digital Video or Versatile Disk (DVD). The DVD is a read only format for recording a relatively large amount of high quality data. When delivered to a user, the disk is input into a CD-ROM player on a client device such as a computer. Software on the client device allows the DVD formatted data to be read., 45843=A standard referred to as Digital Video Interactive (DVI) format developed by Intel Corporation is a compression and storage format for full-motion video and high-fidelity audio data. The DVI standard uses interframe compression techniques similar to that of the MPEG standard and uses ADPCM compression for audio data. The compression method used in DVI is referred to as RTV 2.0 (real time video), and this compression method is incorporated into Intel's AVK (audio/video kernel) software for its DVI product line. IBM has adopted DVI as the standard for displaying video for its Ultimedia product line. The DVI file format is based on the Intel i750 chipset and is supported through the Media Control Interface (MCI) for Windows. Microsoft and Intel jointly announced the creation of the DV MCI (digital video media control interface) command set for Windows 3.1 in 1992.}",

In an operation 602, DVD content is recorded onto a disc. The DVD content is in the form of standard DVD content familiar to those skilled in the art. Then, in an operation 604 DVD-ROM content is generated. This content is preferably HTML encoded content which can be read and operated on by standard Internet browsers. In an operation 606, a plurality of directories are incorporated into the DVD-ROM content. The directories allow operation with multiple user device platforms. The directories preferably include common directories which can be used on several platforms sharing common properties as well as platform specific directories for use with platforms having unique interface requirements. Thereafter, in an operation 608, the DVD-ROM content along with the directories is recorded onto the disc. Then, in an operation 610, the user's particular device platform is determined. This operation occurs automatically upon the user's attempt to use the disc.
