B440 M2 TRC#1 UC on UCS TRC Bills of Material (BOMs) Cisco TAC is not obligated troubleshoot UC apps issues in a deployment with insufficient or overloaded I/O devices. Storage access adapters must be able to accommodate the storage IOPS (described in the Storage section of this policy). LAN access adapters must be able to accommodate the LAN usage of UC VMs (described in UC app design guides). In most cases detailed capacity planning is not required for LAN IO or storage access IO. TRC adapter choices have been made to accommodate the IO of all UC on UCS app co-residency scenarios that will fit on the TRC. For guidance on active vs. standby network ports, see the Cisco UC Design Guide] and QoS Design Considerations for Virtual UC with UCS It is the customer's responsibility to ensure the external LAN and storage access meet UC app design requirements. IO Capacity and Performance There are no UC restrictions on hardware vendors for I/O Devices other than that VMware HCL and the server vendor/model must be compatible with them and support them. The customer is also responsible for configuring redundant devices",
