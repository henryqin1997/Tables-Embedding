There are roughly 1700 students here, and probably 500 or less actually party. Don't think that you need to get drunk all the time. The dorms are nice, but the apartments and theme houses are better. The dorms are really great freshman year for helping you get to know your classmates., 59865=Adrian College has been determined one of the safest campuses in Michigan. Each residence building requires entry via key or key card, and each dorm room has an individual lock. Campus Safety officers are trained intensively and are overseen by former police deputies and current reserve police officers. Their are also resident assistants in each hall to promote a safe environment. According to the Annual Security Report, in 2012 there were only 4 total reports of aggravated or sexual assault and 8 burglaries on campus among 1700 students., 133070=haven't seen dorm yet will see dorm june 12,2013}",

Tips for prospective students Stay the night before you come here, and request a Freshmen hall like Davis, or Stevens. Don't let them tell you that is not available, everyone has a futon you can crash on. You will get the real experience that way. Bang for the buck They give WONDERFUL scholarships, however don't expect much. The living situations are awful, and you can never live off campus unless you win the housing lottery your senior year. The dorms are awful, and hardly fit to live in. The classrooms are just as bad, no air conditioning, and the heat is shabby. The only nice buildings house sporting events...go figure.
