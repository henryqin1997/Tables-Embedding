            "If you only take your core classes and go full time it is worth it and a great campus for the price.",
            "Food is usually really good except the star bucks coffee. They have a lot of space to eat and a really neat Cyber cafe looking over the lake.",

            "An easy school, you can raise your GPA here.",
            "Take only main courses, I was told from my four year school that the community college classes like Spanish, business and Kines classes are tech classes and wont count. The classes are considered almost high school level courses to a four year program.",
            "NVC I rate as a fair school. The campus is nice, but the adviser's are awful and don't help much at all. In fact I lost 30 hours when I transferred because I was given false information"

    "textAfterTable": "Comments Great for these types of students great for any kind of student. as long as you have the dedication to do your best. Tips for prospective students The campus is growing every year, but its very nice and peaceful. The instructors are very helpful. The college also has small classes for one on one time with the instructor if you need additional help. Not to mention the computer labs that have people who specialize in the subjects you need help in. Bang for the buck Although it is a community college, you are getting what you paid for. Am learning a lot I learned a lot more than I thought I would.
