In addition to 2 CPU cores with a base clock speed of 1.0 GHz (no turbo), the 28-nanometer chip also integrates a Radeon HD 8180 GPU, a single-channel DDR3L-1066 memory controller as well as the Southbridge with various I/O- ports., 4423=The power consumption of the entire SoC is rated at just 3.9 watts. Thus, the A4-1200 is suitable for slim ultraportables and passively cooled tablets., 5608=Due to the low clock speed of just 1.0 GHz, the performance is quite modest and similar to the old\u00a0AMD C-60\u00a0or an Intel Celeron N2805. For simple office and multimedia tasks, the A4-1200 has sufficient power; however, it will quickly reach its limits in more demanding applications and games.}",
