            "I always feel safe. They have emergency buttons all around and there are always cops everywhere! Don't park illegally! :P",
            "I have several Greek friends (girls and guys) who love it, but I don't have any personal experience, sorry!",
            "I'm a music major, so I don't really get to be involved in clubs... but I hear we have some great ones!",
            "Usually we are the nicer kids. Snobby doesn't go well with us. For example, our football fans are normally really considerate to other teams when they visit etc.",
            "For homecoming, its fun to go see all the sorority and fraternity houses because they but up really extravagant decorations outside! If you are going to join OSU's family, you need to learn *pistols firing*! Just point your pointer finger and extend your thumb and hold it in the air, GO POKES! :) Also, everyone here loves the marching band, they did a Beatles, Disco, etc shows and they were amazing!",
            "Pretty pricey, but I absolutely love OSU and am getting a great education.",
            "Going to movies or church events are great, there's a lot of eating places on and near campus. Just hanging out in the lobbies is fun to, (they have TVs and some floors have things like pool etc)!",
            "Oklahoma State is voted best Student Union!",
            "Some people are stupid (to be expected), but the dorm hang-outs are tons of fun, it's a great way to make friends.",
            "Classes take work and the essays are usually pretty long, but if you pay attention teacher's give you all the information you need. If you have any questions, go to their office hours and they will be impressed with your effort and be happy to help.",
            "Make sure you take campus tours and talk to some current students at the colleges you want to attend! It makes a huge difference- my visits and tours changed my college choice at last minute and I am thrilled with my decision.",
            "The teachers are VERY knowledgeable and helpful. The campus and town have a real at home feeling. Great education and helpful advisers."

Houses are usually all gone by June, 432253=It's a beautiful campus with more clubs and opportunities than anybody could ever hope for. Diversity, and creativity are two words to describe life at OSU. With over 1500 students from all over the world and 450 student organizations, there is something for everyone., 316252=One thing I wish I would've done before I got here is wait to come here. I transferred from a jucco in the spring of January 2012 and its been a bumpy ride since then but I'm handling the reins now; so if you transfer make sure you have a plan on what to do and when to do it. If not, wait till the Fall., 467394=I've enjoyed all of the food here on campus, and there are many options to choose from. The restaurants in the dorms are going to be open later than anywhere else so if you're craving something from the union, get it early! Also, go a random times during the day like 3:00 to avoid dinner and lunch rushes., 210724=one of the traditions is going to the student union. another tradition is before a home game the band and all the students march to the stadium ,having a big pep ralley., 737677=OSU police share jurisdiction with Stillwater police so real officers are on campus at all times. The emergency light system also allows students to feel safer when walking alone. OSU is also implementing a new system fall 2013 that has OSU students work in an escort program. If you don't feel safe walking home at night you can call them and they'll send someone to pick you up at your class and walk you back to your dorm., 152104=Tip #1: Rain boots are always helpful when you ahve a test at 5:30 in the afternoon and it is pouring Tip #2: Eat on campus as much as possible, your meal plan only carries over so much. Tip #3: Set aside time everyday for homework and studying. College is not necessarily harder, but definitely time consuming Tip#4: NEVER skip class unless you are seriously ill. The information from class is always helpful on tests. Tip #5: Don't be afraid to ask mom and dad for money. You can't always have all the money you need, but you can't be asking them every week either., 1131950=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 1095864=The amount of food here at OSU is incredible. The student union has many restaurants that handle the student flow pretty well. Around 11:30 until 12:30 the student union is a crazy maze of people, but otherwise very good., 17140=While room and board is a little bit on the pricey side, OSU is the best buy in the big 12, so says the OkState homepage. Where you live on campus determines how much you pay a month. Meal plan is a great deal for freshmen! However, you do have a minimum of $1000 a semester your first year. Meal plan can be spent at any place that sells food including the markets. With the fees that you pay it includes the gym (which is top notch), all of the computer labs and printers (if you have your own printer great.. but you already pay for the ink in the school ones), lab fees depending on your schedule and upkeep of the sidewalks and reconstruction of the buildings., 201623=i am a readmitted student planning on returning in the fall of 2012. i miss the atmosphere and school spirit of osu as it was very uplifting in several ways. oklahoma state is a great school academically as well as the many clubs and activites it has to offer; it is an overall outstanding choice to attend., 352049=OSU received 2011 Big 12's Safest Campus. There are several lights and safety towers all over campus. The police line is always on if someone is walking home at night and would feel more comfortable with them taking them home!!, 637198=First years have a mandatory food card they must purchase, the cheapest being $1000.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Engineering Students, Agriculture Students, or HRAD Students. Or just any one in the Big-12 Area whose just wants to have fun. Tips for prospective students Get involved in something, it keeps you focused. Rather you drink or not, you will probably get carried away with the idea that you are away from your parents for 9 months (like i did), but as long as you make the grades and attend class during the week you'll be fine. Use all the free services Oklahoma State offers you. If you need help in a class, financial aid, depression, sickness, or anything else, there is someone you can go to. Bang for the buck The Colvin Center is recreation center at Oklahoma State. Its one of the top 10 in the country. It offers a huge gym consisting of free weights and just about every machine you would ever need. It also has i think 4 or 5 basketball courts, an outdoor and indoor swimming pool, running track, virtual golf, a rock climbing wall (a big hit- you can either climb when you want, or take a class), racket ball, table tennis, and more. They also offer free aerobic or martial art classes for any student. Education - for an agriculture major,",
