For example, the processor 1632 may be any general-purpose processor, controller, or microcontroller device. In some embodiments, processor 1632 controls logging of data (e.g., locate information) from the processing circuit 1628, timing system 1640, and/or location tracking system 1642 to the local memory 1634. The manner in which such data may be logged to the local memory 1634 may depend on the type of data being logged, as the operation of locate receiver 1610 is not limited in this respect., 134522=U.S. publication no. 2009-0204466-A1, published Aug. 13, 2009, filed Sep. 4, 2008, and entitled \u201cTicket Approval System For and Method of Performing Quality Control In Field Service Applications;\u201d, 370679=In some embodiments, the locate receiver 1610 is capable of operating in a null mode (e.g., capable of detecting a null signal when positioned over an object (e.g., facility) emitting a magnetic field), such that RF antenna 1624 may comprise a null detection antenna. Alternatively, the locate receiver 1610 is capable of operating in a peak detection mode (e.g., capable of detecting a peak signal when over an object (e.g., facility) emitting a magnetic field), and the RF antenna 1624 comprises two peak detection antennae, which may be positioned substantially parallel to each other but at different positions within the locate receiver (e.g., at different heights). In some embodiments, the locate receiver 1610 is capable of operating in both peak detection and null detection modes, and the RF antenna 1624 may comprise three antennae, e.g., one null detection antenna and two peak detection antennae. However, RF antenna 1624 may comprise any other number, type, and orientation of antennae, as the locate receivers described herein are not limited in these respects., 473359=The display 146 of the combination locate and marking device 1810 may be used to display various information of interest to a user. For example, information about a detected magnetic field strength, a detected signal frequency, a mode of operation, or a depth measurement may be displayed. Similarly, information about marking material (e.g., color, brand, amount remaining in a marking material dispenser, etc.) may also be displayed to the user. In some embodiments, the display may be a touch screen display, although other display types are also possible, as discussed above in connection with previously described embodiments., 136817=U.S. publication no. 2009-0202112-A1, published Aug. 13, 2009, filed Feb. 11, 2009, and entitled \u201cSearchable Electronic Records of Underground Facility Locate Marking Operations;\u201d and, 379882=It should be appreciated that while the foregoing discussion focuses on logging locate information to local memory 1634, the locate information may also, or alternatively, be transmitted to remote computer 1650 via communication interface 1636. As with logging locate information to local memory 1634, the transmission of locate information to remote computer 1650 may be performed continuously, periodically in response to one or more types of events, in response to user input or actuation of an actuator, or in any other suitable manner., 132987=U.S. publication no. 2008-0228294-A1, published Sep. 18, 2008, filed Mar. 13, 2007, and entitled \u201cMarking System and Method With Location and/or Time Tracking;\u201d, 133922=U.S. publication no. 2009-0201311-A1, published Aug. 13, 2009, filed Jan. 30, 2009, and entitled \u201cElectronic Manifest of Underground Facility Locate Marks;\u201d, 428366=According to another embodiment, locate information generated in connection with the locate receiver functionality of combination locate and marking device 1810 may be logged and/or transmitted periodically (e.g., at least every two seconds, every five seconds, or at any other suitable intervals). For example, the locate information may be logged in local memory 122 and/or transmitted to remote computer 150 via communication interface 124 every five seconds, every ten seconds, every thirty seconds, every minute, every five minutes, or at any other time interval. According to one such embodiment, marking information relating to any marking performed with the combination locate and marking device (e.g., marking material information, position of the combination locate and marking device, duration of actuation, etc.) may be logged upon actuation of the actuation system 120., 429326=According to another embodiment, locate information generated in connection with the locate receiver functionality of combination locate and marking device 1810 may be logged in response to an event. The event may be the detection of an underground facility, for example as indicated by detection of a magnetic field magnitude above a threshold value, may be the detection of the absence of an underground facility, may be the taking of a depth measurement, or may be any other event of interest. As but one example, information relating to magnetic field strength, detected electrical current magnitude, geographical location of the combination locate and marking device, and timing information may be automatically logged into an electronic record in local memory 122 upon detection by RF antenna 1624 of a magnetic field magnitude exceeding a threshold value. Other events, however, may additionally or alternatively be used to trigger logging of locate information related to the locate receiver functionality., 137043=U.S. publication no. 2009-0204614-A1, published Aug. 13, 2009, filed Feb. 11, 2009, and entitled \u201cSearchable Electronic Records of Underground Facility Locate Marking Operations.\u201d, 135481=U.S. publication no. 2009-0210298-A1, published Aug. 20, 2009, filed Apr. 30, 2009, and entitled \u201cTicket Approval System For and Method of Performing Quality Control In Field Service Applications;\u201d, 135961=U.S. publication no. 2009-0204238-A1, published Aug. 13, 2009, filed Feb. 2, 2009, and entitled \u201cElectronically Controlled Marking Apparatus and Methods;\u201d, 475586=In act 2012, an actuation event of an actuator of the combination locate and marking device is sensed. In act 2014, any information of interest associated with the combination locate and marking event is captured in response to sensing the actuation event. For example, any of the information shown in Table 17 may be captured, or any other information of interest associated with the combination locate and marking device., 134761=U.S. publication no. 2009-0207019-A1, published Aug. 20, 2009, filed Apr. 30, 2009, and entitled \u201cTicket Approval System For and Method of Performing Quality Control In Field Service Applications;\u201d, 103351=U.S. Publication No. 2006/0282280, naming inventors Stotz et al. and entitled \u201cTicket and Data Management\u201d (hereafter \u201cStotz\u201d), also is directed to a locate device (i.e., a \u201clocator\u201d) including a GPS receiver. Upon detection of the presence of a utility line, Stotz' locate device can update ticket data with GPS coordinates for the detected utility line. Once the locate device has updated the ticket data, the reconfigured ticket data may be transmitted to a network., 133524=U.S. publication no. 2009-0202101-A1, published Aug. 13, 2009, filed Feb. 12, 2008, and entitled \u201cElectronic Manifest of Underground Facility Locate Marks;\u201d, 419137=The operation of the components of combination locate and marking device 1810 may be coordinated in various manners. As has been described previously herein, the detection electronics may operate to detect the presence or absence of a target object, such as an underground facility. The marking-related components (e.g., actuation system 120, marking dispenser 116, etc.) may be used in connection with dispensing a marking material, for example to mark the location of an underground facility once detected. In practice, the two activities (detecting a target object and marking a location of the target object) may not coincide temporally. Rather, a locate technician may scan an area one or more times to detect the presence of the target object, or may have to scan over a large area to determine the extent of the target object, utilizing the locate receiver functionality of the combination locate and marking device. In some embodiments, the locate technician may operate the combination locate and marking device to dispense a marking material after the target object is detected, or in some instances intermittently while detecting the target object (e.g., while following the length of an underground facility). Thus, various schemes may be employed to coordinate the object detection functionality and the marking functionality., 134320=U.S. publication no. 2009-0204625-A1, published Aug. 13, 2009, filed Feb. 5, 2009, and entitled \u201cElectronic Manifest of Underground Facility Locate Operation;\u201d, 83632=Ser. No. 12/569,192 claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119(e), of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/102,122, filed on Oct. 2, 2008, entitled \u201cCombination Locate and Marking Device With a Data Acquisition System Installed Therein, and Associated Methods.\u201d, 410848=Communication between the locate receiver 1610 and the marking device 110 may proceed under any suitable protocol, and may include any suitable information, as the embodiments described herein relating to a locate device communicatively coupled to a marking device are not limited in this respect. According to one embodiment, one of the locate device and marking device may receive one or more event entries or one or more electronic records generated by the other device. The receiving device may then combine the received event entries/electronic records with event entries/electronic records it has generated, and store and/or transmit the combined data. Event entries and/or electronic records from different devices may be combined based on a common key (e.g., a common timestamp, a common job ID, any combination of information, such as date, time and location, or any other suitable key) or in any other manner., 133723=U.S. publication no. 2009-0202110-A1, published Aug. 13, 2009, filed Sep. 11, 2008, and entitled \u201cElectronic Manifest of Underground Facility Locate Marks;\u201d, 411824=As a non-limiting example, the locate receiver may generate a locate event entry of the format illustrated in Table 12. The locate event entry may be transmitted to the marking device, which itself may have generated a marking actuation event entry of the type illustrated in Table 3. The marking device may combine the locate event entry from the locate receiver with the marking actuation event entry it has generated if, for example the two records share some common \u201ckey,\u201d i.e., means of identifying, relating and/or associating the respective event entries/records from different devices. Examples of common keys may include, but are not limited to, a common job ID, device ID's that are recognized as a working pair of \u201cpartnered\u201d locate receivers and marking devices (discussed further below), common file names or file extensions for electronic records, a common timestamp (an exact match may not be required in all embodiments, but rather time within some suitable tolerance may suffice), a common geographic location (e.g., one or more GPS coordinates for a present location of the respective devices), and information derived from any other entry or combination of entries from the respective devices. The combined, or compiled, electronic record, may then be stored in local memory of marking device 110 and/or transmitted to remote computer 1650., 371847=The RF antenna 1624 may be coupled to the detection circuit 1626 such that the signal(s) received/detected by the RF antenna 1624 may be provided to the detection circuit 1626 as an output signal of the RF antenna. The output signal of the RF antenna may be any frequency detectable by the antenna, and in some embodiments may be between approximately 512 Hz and 1 MHz, although these non-limiting frequencies are provided primarily for purposes of illustration. As mentioned, the output signal of the RF antenna 1624, which in some embodiments is an analog signal, may be provided to detection circuit 1626, which may perform various functions. For example, the detection circuit 1626 may perform various \u201cfront-end\u201d operations on the output signal of RF antenna 1624, such as filtering, buffering, frequency shifting or modulation, and/or pre-amplifying the output signal. Furthermore, the detection circuit 1626 may perform additional functions, such as amplifying and/or digitizing the output signal provided by RF antenna 1624. It should be appreciated, however, that the types of functions described as being performed by detection circuit 1626 are non-limiting examples, and that other functions may additionally or alternatively be performed., 375773=For example, data from timing system 1640 and/or location tracking system 1642 may be automatically logged continuously or periodically to the local memory 1634, may be logged in response to one or more types of events (e.g., may be logged automatically when a particular event occurs), and/or may be logged at any suitable times. In particular, in one implementation, logging may occur at periodic intervals during performance of a locate operation, such as every second, every five seconds, every minute, or at any other suitable time interval. According to another embodiment, timing information and/or geographic information from timing system 1640 and location tracking system 1642, respectively, may be logged in response to particular types of events, such as detecting an underground facility or detecting the absence of an underground facility. Such events may be identified by signals output by processing circuit 1628 to processor 1632. As a non-limiting example, timing information and/or geographic information may be logged when a characteristic (e.g., magnetic field strength) of a signal detected by RF antenna 1624 is greater than a particular threshold value, which may be indicated by a signal output from processing circuit 1628 to processor 1632, and which occurrence may be indicative of the presence of an underground facility. Similarly, in some embodiments time timing information and/or geographic information may be logged when a signal detected by RF antenna 1624 has a magnitude above a first threshold and the gain of the locate receiver 1610 is above a second threshold. It should be appreciated that various combinations of detected signals detected by locate receiver 1610 may be used to trigger logging of information (e.g., timing information and/or geographic information) to local memory. It should also be appreciated that any information available from the location tracking system 1642 (e.g., any information available in various NMEA data messages, such as coordinated universal time, date, latitude, north/south indicator, longitude, east/west indicator, number and identification of satellites used in the position solution, number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation, azimuth and SNR values, dilution of precision values) may be included in geographic information constituting all or a portion of logged locate information., 135241=U.S. publication no. 2009-0210297-A1, published Aug. 20, 2009, filed Apr. 30, 2009, and entitled \u201cTicket Approval System For and Method of Performing Quality Control In Field Service Applications;\u201d, 533696=In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccarrying,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d \u201ccontaining,\u201d \u201cinvolving,\u201d \u201cholding,\u201d \u201ccomposed of,\u201d and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to. Only the transitional phrases \u201cconsisting of\u201d and \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d shall be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03., 133356=U.S. publication no. 2009-0013928-A1, published Jan. 15, 2009, filed Sep. 24, 2008, and entitled \u201cMarking System and Method;\u201d, 469344=The information logged and/or transmitted by combination locate and marking device 1810 may be used for various applications. For example, the information may be used to monitor progress and/or operation of the user, to monitor operation of the device itself, to reconstruct the user's actions at a later time and date, and/or to compare to historical information. Various examples of computer-assisted visual rendering of locate information and/or marking information are discussed below in section VI., 479641=In act 2124, a determination is made whether the locate and marking operation is complete, for example based on instructions provided with the locate request. If the locate operation is complete, method 2100 ends. If the locate operation is not complete, method 2100 returns to act 2116., 478693=In act 2118, it is determined whether the target facility is located, for example based upon the strength of any electromagnetic field detected in act 2116. If the target facility is located, method 2100 proceeds to act 2120, at which the user dispenses marking material, for example by actuating an actuator of the combination locate and marking device. Conversely, if the target facility is not located, method 2100 returns to act 2116., 109651=Examples of marking devices configured to collect some types of information relating specifically to marking operations are provided in U.S. publication no. 2008-0228294-A1, published Sep. 18, 2008, filed Mar. 13, 2007, and entitled \u201cMarking System and Method With Location and/or Time Tracking,\u201d and U.S. publication no. 2008-0245299-A1, published Oct. 9, 2008, filed Apr. 4, 2007, and entitled \u201cMarking System and Method,\u201d both of which publications are incorporated herein by reference. These publications describe, amongst other things, collecting information relating to the geographic location, time, and/or characteristics (e.g., color/type) of dispensed marking material from a marking device and generating an electronic record based on this collected information. Applicants have recognized and appreciated that collecting information relating to both geographic location and color of dispensed marking material provides for automated correlation of geographic information for a locate mark to facility type (e.g., red=electric power lines and cables; blue=potable water; orange=telecommunication lines; yellow=gas, oil, steam); in contrast, in conventional locate devices equipped with GPS capabilities as discussed above, there is no apparent automated provision for readily linking GPS information for a detected facility to the type of facility detected., 103863=U.S. Publication No. 2007/0219722, naming inventors Sawyer, Jr. et al. and entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Collecting and Updating Geographical Data\u201d (hereafter \u201cSawyer\u201d), is directed to collecting and recording data representative of the location and characteristics of utilities and infrastructure in the field for creating a grid or map. Sawyer employs a field data collection unit including a \u201clocating pole\u201d that is placed on top of or next to a utility to be identified and added to the grid or map. The locating pole includes an antenna coupled to a location determination system, such as a GPS unit, to provide longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates of the utility under or next to the end of the locating pole. The data gathered by the field data collection unit is sent to a server to provide a permanent record that may be used for damage prevention and asset management operations., 405873=As with the marking devices described above, some aspects of the invention provide a locate device (e.g., locate receiver) that may be configured (e.g., via particular instructions executing on the processor 1632) to operate in multiple different modes to collect various information relating not only to a locate operation (locate information), but additionally or alternatively various information relating to the work site/dig areas in which the locate operation is performed. For example, in one implementation, the locate receiver may be configured to operate in a first \u201clocate mode\u201d which essentially follows various aspects of the operation of the locate receiver 1610 described herein, and also may be configured to operate in a second \u201clandmark identification mode,\u201d like that described previously in connection with a marking device. When switched into the landmark mode, the locate receiver may stop detecting a magnetic field, e.g., the RF antenna of the locate receiver may be temporarily disabled in some embodiments. In other embodiments, the locate receiver may continue to operate and the landmark mode may represent additional functionality added to the locate receiver functionality., 134121=U.S. publication no. 2009-0202111-A1, published Aug. 13, 2009, filed Jan. 30, 2009, and entitled \u201cElectronic Manifest of Underground Facility Locate Marks;\u201d, 479216=In act 2122, information associated with the locate operation may be stored locally and/or transmitted to an external system or device. For example, data, such as the data shown in Table 9, may be stored in local memory and/or transmitted in real time or non-real time to a remote computer and/or network via a communication link of the combination locate and marking device., 478002=In act 2116, the user performs a scan with the combination locate and marking device to detect the presence and/or absence of a target facility. For example, the user may sweep the combination locate and marking device over the ground. The signal strength of any detected electromagnetic field may be presented to the user via the user interface. The user interface may include, for example, a visual display of the signal strength (e.g., display numerical readings of signal strength, display a variable length bar that corresponds to signal strength, etc.) and/or an audible tone that varies in pitch and/or amplitude with signal strength., 477599=In act 2114, the user activates (i.e., powers on) the combination locate and marking device by the actuation of, for example, a manual pushbutton or toggle switch of user interface 126, or in any other suitable manner. As a result, power from power source 114 is delivered to the active components of combination locate and marking device., 136158=U.S. publication no. 2009-0208642-A1, published Aug. 20, 2009, filed Feb. 2, 2009, and entitled \u201cMarking Apparatus and Methods For Creating an Electronic Record of Marking Operations;\u201d, 84556=Ser. No. 12/568,087 also claims a priority benefit, under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd120, as a continuation-in-part (CIP) of U.S. Non-provisional application Ser. No. 12/539,497, filed on Aug. 11, 2009, entitled \u201cMethods and Apparatus for Generating an Electronic Record of a Marking Operation based on Marking Device Actuations,\u201d which in turn claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119(e), of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/102,151, filed on Oct. 2, 2008, entitled \u201cData acquisition system for and method of analyzing marking operations based on marking device actuations.\u201d, 476066=In act 2016, information associated with the combined locate and marking event, including the information captured at block 2014, may be stored and/or transmitted in real time or non-real time to a remote computer and/or network., 133190=U.S. publication no. 2008-0245299-A1, published Oct. 9, 2008, filed Apr. 4, 2007, and entitled \u201cMarking System and Method;\u201d, 380500=As discussed above in connection with the marking device 110, in yet another embodiment, the processor 1632 of the locate receiver 1610 may be configured to continuously collect various available locate information (e.g., repeatedly/regularly poll all available input devices and other components of the locate receiver) and generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets including locate information. In one aspect of this embodiment, each data packet of locate information may include a header, one or more flag fields, and one or more information payload fields. For example, in one implementation, the header for each packet may include one or more of a job ID (e.g., ticket identifier), technician ID, device ID (e.g., serial number), packet type ID, and/or a time stamp corresponding to logging of information/generation of the packet. Each packet also may include one or more payload fields for carrying information provided by the polled device(s) or components of the locate receiver, and one or more flag fields that are set (or reset) upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events (e.g., signal strength from receiver antenna exceeding a predetermined threshold, low power, communication link fail, etc.). In this manner, a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor, in which certain interrupt events, such as an actuation and/or release of an actuator, or other event-based logging of locate information, \u201ctag\u201d certain data packets via an interrupt flag. In yet other aspects of this embodiment, all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and/or transmitted from the locate device in essentially real time; alternatively, only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and/or transmitted., 427339=According to one embodiment, locate information generated in connection with the locate receiver functionality of combination locate and marking device 1810 may be logged and/or transmitted continuously. For example, object detection-related information such as the detected magnetic field strength (expressed, for example, as a percentage of the maximum detectable magnetic field strength), the magnitude of the electrical current creating the detected magnetic field, and the location of the combination locate and marking device may be logged continuously to local memory 122, for example in one or more electronic records in the local memory 122. According to one such embodiment, information relating to any marking performed with the combination locate and marking device (e.g., marking material information, position of the combination locate and marking device, duration of actuation, etc.) may be logged upon actuation of the actuation system 120., 136622=U.S. publication no. 2009-0201178-A1, published Aug. 13, 2009, filed Feb. 2, 2009, and entitled \u201cMethods For Evaluating Operation of Marking Apparatus;\u201d, 439712=Table 17 below illustrates one non-limiting example of four electronic records that may be stored in the local memory 122 of the combination locate and marking device 1810, each corresponding, for example, to a separate actuation event of actuation system 120. It should be appreciated, however, that these are merely examples, and that various alternative electronic records may be generated according to the aspects of the invention, for example reflecting different types of information associated with operation of a combination locate and marking device.}",
