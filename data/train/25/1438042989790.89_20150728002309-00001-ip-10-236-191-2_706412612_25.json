Our first licensee, the Institute for Cellular Medicine (\"ICM\") in San Jose, Costa Rica, an entity controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, began revenue generating activities in the third quarter of 2006. \u00a0A second licensee subscribed to our model four months later in January 2007 with its base of operations located in Mexico. \u00a0However, due to a lack of sufficient development of a market by the licensee, we expect to terminate the Mexican license agreement in 2008., 7054=In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (\"FIN 48\") - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (\"SFAS No. 109\"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 109 and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a return. Guidance is also provided on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. \u00a0The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 in 2007 and no material uncertain tax positions were identified. \u00a0Thus, the adoption of FIN 48 did not have an impact on the Company's financial statements., 118646=December 31, 2006, 34401=We analyzed our licensing agreements for off-balance impacts and have determined as of December 31, 2007, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors., 163084=10/4/2007, 81418=At the end of 2007, we had a change in strategic direction toward focusing on the development of our product candidates for United States commercialization. \u00a0As such, we modified our license agreement with ICM to eliminate the need to fund and manage its daily operations, and we will no longer be consolidating ICM's financial results in our future financial statements. \u00a0As such, instead of reflecting ICM's total revenues in our financial statements (as has historically been presented) our revenues from ICM will only consist of our royalties earned under this license agreement (equal to 20% of the ICM's revenues) which will likely cause a decline in revenues in the near future. \u00a0However, we expect similar declines in cost of services and operating expenses due to the effects of deconsolidation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 60267=$727,000 of general and administrative costs incurred by our licensee, ICM, that was consolidated through December 31, 2007;, 84652=Year Ended December 31,, 101995=In 2007, we acquired all intellectual property rights to a novel stem cell line derived from menstrual blood (\"Endometrial Regenerative Cells\" or \"ERC\") that is easily expandable, applicable as a universal donor, and can be administered intravenously for repair of injured tissue. \u00a0Potential uses of the ERC population include regeneration of tissue, such as healing of injured myocardium, reducing the cirrhotic area in liver failure, and accelerating new blood vessel formation in tissues that lack oxygen. \u00a0Similar to other stem cells, which are in Phase II and III clinical trials in the United States, ERC's appear to be capable of suppressing pathological immune responses, making them an ideal candidate for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. \u00a0\u00a0In comparison to other types of stem cells, ERC cells appear to possess: (a) higher levels of growth factor secretion; (b) increased proliferative rate while maintaining chromosomal integrity; and (c) higher immune modulatory activity. \u00a0, 166422=12/14/2005, 120291=March 31, 2006, 171337=The future market for stem cell research and treatment is believed to be quite large. \u00a0A report by Research and Markets predicts that the international cell therapy market will be worth $56.2 billion in 2010 and $96.3 billion in 2015. \u00a0It is thought the largest area of expansion will be in diseases of the central nervous system and cancer. However, it is unlikely that stem cell treatments will be approved for broad application in neurological and degenerative diseases within the next 5-10 years in the United States. \u00a0Those in need of treatment must either wait until FDA clearance is given or seek treatment abroad in countries where governmental approval has been granted. \u00a0, 58526=$311,000 of general and administrative costs incurred by our licensee, ICM, that was consolidated through December 31, 2007; and, 125974=We spent $642,759 and $116,398 on research and development activities in fiscal year 2007 and 2006, respectively., 115360=As of February 29, 2008, there were approximately 70 holders of record of our common stock and we believe there were approximately 70 beneficial owners., 195861=[ \u00a0\u00a0] \u00a0\u00a0TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 188143=The number of shares outstanding of the registrant's common stock on February 29, 2008 was 133,527,122., 75861=Cost of services include laboratory and clinical expenses associated with the generation of revenues. \u00a0During 2007 and 2006, our cost of services consisted primarily of expenses incurred by our consolidated licensee, ICM. \u00a0In future periods, as we no longer will be consolidating ICM, we expect our cost of services to be minimal., 163644=12/18/2006, 71032=Research and development costs include research staff salaries, acquisition of in-process research and development, patent investigational expenditures, patent application filing fees, patent attorney costs, and other research and development costs (excluding laboratory expenses which are included in cost of services above). \u00a0Research and development expenses in 2007 consisted primarily of $355,000 incurred for all intellectual property rights surrounding our ERC stem cell line, as well as research staff salaries and other development costs. \u00a0Expenditures in 2006 consisted of costs related to define and file our patent applications surrounding the use of stem cells in a variety of applications, methods for expanding stem cells, and matching stem cells to a recipient to reduce rejection rates., 173487=Because of the modification to the license agreement, ICM ceased to be consolidated in the Company's financial statements beginning December 31, 2007. As a result, the balance sheet at December 31, 2007 does not include the assets and liabilities of ICM. \u00a0However, as ICM was not deconsolidated until December 31, 2007, the Statement of Operations and Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2007 incorporate the revenues, expenses and cash flows of ICM through the date of deconsolidation. \u00a0, 53790=Operating loss decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to increases in revenue, partially offset by increases in cost of services and research and development expenses, the specifics of which are described above., 96511=Until December 31, 2007, our licensee in Costa Rica met the definition of a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Interpretation No. 46, \"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 41\" as amended December 2003 (\"FIN No. 46\") and therefore met the requirements for consolidation in our financial statements as we were required to fund the operations and were the recipient of a majority of the income or losses generated from the licensee. \u00a0However, such consolidation required us to be responsible for day-to-day internal controls and reporting of the entity which not only posed an administrative burden to us, but also detracted from our focus on our biotech activities. \u00a0Further, the obligation to fund the entity posed additional financial risks to us. \u00a0, 182310=A stem cell is a self-renewing, unspecialized cell that can differentiate into many or possibly all of the more than 200 types of specialized cells in the body. Following decades of research with animal stem cells, the first human stem cell was isolated from an embryo in 1998., 184001=Medistem Laboratories, Inc. (formerly SGC Holdings, Inc) (\"Medistem\" or the \"Company\") was formed in 2001 as a Nevada corporation. \u00a0During 2005, we experienced a change in control and a new strategic direction. \u00a0On October 12, 2005, we entered into a Contribution Agreement with Neil Riordan Ph.D., whereby Dr. Riordan transferred all of his rights, title and interest to certain intellectual property in exchange for 100,223,602 shares of our common stock. \u00a0In connection with this transaction, Dr. Riordan assumed the roles of Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company., 196763=[X] \u00a0\u00a0ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 160115=4/6/2007, 81842=Revenues for 2007 consisted of $2,339,276 of fees generated by our consolidated licensee, ICM and $164,180 of revenues generated through licensing activities of Medistem. \u00a0Revenues for 2006 consisted exclusively of revenues from ICM. \u00a0, 49192=Under the terms of our former license agreement with ICM, we received royalties based on 85% of pretax income, computed on a cumulative basis. \u00a0The remaining net income was attributable to the shareholders of ICM. \u00a0ICM was not in a cumulative income position until the fourth quarter of 2007. \u00a0Through December 31, 2007, the amount of cumulative earnings attributable to the shareholders of ICM amounted to $27,868, and is reflected as minority interest in the statement of operations., 3313=In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (\"SFAS No. 141(R)\") and No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (\"SFAS No. 160\"). SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 are products of a joint project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board. \u00a0The revised standards continue the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting. SFAS No. 141(R) will significantly change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. These changes include the expensing of acquisition related costs and restructuring costs when incurred, the recognition of all assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value during a step-acquisition, and the recognition of contingent consideration as of the acquisition date if it is more likely than not to be incurred. \u00a0SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. \u00a0SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 are effective for both public and private companies for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (January 1, 2009 for companies with calendar year-ends). SFAS No. 141(R) will be applied prospectively. SFAS No. 160 requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. All other requirements of SFAS No. 160 shall be applied prospectively. Early adoption is prohibited for both standards. \u00a0The Company is currently evaluating the effects of these pronouncements on its financial position and results of operations., 35952=\u00a0Investing cash outflows were $592,205 for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $486,122 for the year ended December 31, 2006. \u00a0The deconsolidation of ICM at December 31, 2007 caused their existing balance of cash and cash equivalents $336,279 at December 31, 2007) to no longer be reflected on our financial statements. \u00a0Other investing cash outflows consisted primarily of $265,926 of purchases of equipment, the majority of which were purchased by ICM. \u00a0In 2006, our cash outflows consisted of purchases of equipment, leasehold improvements and other fixed assets, the majority of which were for ICM, as well as the purchase of a $60,000 long-term certificate of deposit. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 61191=General and administrative expense includes stock-based compensation, salaries, rent, utilities, general office expenses, insurance and other costs necessary to conduct business operations. \u00a0General and administrative expense in 2007 included the following:, 165872=5/19/2006, 89971=Until December 31, 2007, our licensee ICM met the definition of a VIE through its existing capitalization and license agreement with us, and because we were the primary beneficiary of this VIE, as both terms are defined in FIN No. 46. \u00a0As required by FIN No. 46, ICM was consolidated in our consolidated statement of operations \u00a0through December 31, 2007. \u00a0, 125504=As of February 28, 2008, we employed four full-time and one part-time individual. \u00a0None of our employees are represented by a union or other collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. \u00a0Our business model relies heavily on the outsourcing of research and development and general and administrative activities. \u00a0We have established affiliations with numerous organizations throughout the world to help support our biotech activities. \u00a0, 118011=March 31, 2007, 164773=8/23/2006, 188509=The aggregate market value of common stock held by non-affiliates of the registrant (32,242,091 shares) as of June 29, 2007, was $5,158,735 based on the closing sales price per share as reported by the OTCBB on such date., 161551=5/25/2007, 89420=Effective December 31, 2007, ICM no longer met the definition of a VIE. \u00a0As such, we have deconsolidated ICM from our financial statements effective December 31, 2007. \u00a0As a result, our balance sheet at December 31, 2007 does not consolidate the balance sheet of ICM. \u00a0Prior periods have not been restated. \u00a0, 172360=Under the Mexican license agreement, we generated revenues of $164,180 during 2007. \u00a0However, there has been a lack of sufficient market development in Mexico and we do not expect to generate significant future revenues from this licensing agreement., 4240=In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (\"SFAS No. 159\"), which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. \u00a0SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. \u00a0SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007 with early adoption allowed. \u00a0The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, that adopting this standard might have on its financial statements., 119199=September 30, 2006, 92886=In January 2007, we entered into a License Agreement with a Mexican corporation for the use of our intellectual property. \u00a0We also agreed to supply Licensee technologies, materials, and to provide certain administrative functions, in exchange for 90% of the monthly net revenue in excess of $20,000 resulting from Licensee's sale of any product derived from or involving infusion quality adult stem cells. \u00a0\u00a0, 94283=Because of the modification to the license agreement, ICM no longer meets the criteria for consolidation and was deconsolidated in the Company's financial statements beginning December 31, 2007. As a result, the balance sheet at December 31, 2007 does not include the assets and liabilities of ICM. \u00a0On a comparative basis, the balance sheet at December 31, 2006 does include the assets and liabilities of ICM. \u00a0The Statement of Operations for both years ending December 31, 2007 and 2006 include the operating results of ICM and Medistem as de-consolidation did not occur until December 31, 2007. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These events will allow our management to focus on our bio-tech endeavors while retaining cash flows related to the ICM licensee., 116925=September 30, 2007, 109516=Represents shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to options granted and available for future grant under the 2005 Officer & Director Equity Ownership Plan., 172663=In January 2007, we entered into a License Agreement with a Mexican corporation for the use of our intellectual property in Mexico. \u00a0, 70038=Factors that influence our amount of research and development costs include the number of cell types to be developed, the number of patents to be pursued, the volume of clinical trials to be conducted, and the amount of medical discoveries or breakthroughs that merit further research and development. \u00a0In 2007, we hired a Chief of Scientific Development to pursue such endeavors on a full-time basis., 114352=The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2007, concerning outstanding options and rights to purchase common stock granted to participants in our equity compensation plans and the number of shares of common stock remaining available for issuance under such equity compensation plans., 165312=6/22/2006, 119742=June 30, 2006, 167443=2/14/2006, 37846=During 2007, our affiliate, ICM, received an inquiry from the Ministry of Health of Costa Rica (the \"Ministry\") concerning its operations. \u00a0Based on the results of discussions with the Ministry, ICM made certain changes to its operations, none of which had a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations. \u00a0ICM received notification that its existing operations are in compliance with its operating permits. \u00a0However, ICM continues to receive inquiries from government officials concerning their operations. \u00a0There can be no assurance that any such inquiries will be resolved in a manner favorable to ICM., 118169=2007, 179412=ERC cells can be converted into basically all the major tissues of the body, including the liver, lung, pancreas, brain, heart, blood vessel, and muscle. Additionally, these cells produce 100,000 times the number of certain growth factors found in cord blood. \u00a0These findings have been reported in a peer reviewed publication in November, 2007. \u00a0Coauthors of the paper included scientists from Medistem, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, and the Bio-Communications Research Institute., 180456=In 2007, we acquired all intellectual property rights to a novel stem cell technology. The technology derives stem cells from menstrual blood (\"Endometrial Regenerative Cells\" or \"ERC\"). \u00a0Potential uses of the ERC population include regeneration of tissue, such as healing of injured heart tissue, improving liver function, and accelerating new blood vessel formation. \u00a0Similar to other stem cells, which are in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in the United States, ERC's appear to be capable of suppressing pathological immune responses, making them an ideal therapy for autoimmune diseases. \u00a0\u00a0In comparison to other stem cell types ERC cells appear to possess: (a) higher levels of growth factor secretion; (b) increased proliferative rate while maintaining chromosomal integrity; and (c) higher immune modulatory activity. \u00a0, 174744=Until December 31, 2007, our licensee in Costa Rica met the requirements for consolidation in our financial statements as we were required to fund the operations and were the recipient of a majority of the income or losses generated from the licensee. \u00a0However, such consolidation required us to be responsible for day-to-day internal controls and reporting of the entity which not only posed an administrative burden to us, but also detracted from our focus on our biotech activities. \u00a0Further, the obligation to fund the entity posed additional financial risks to us. \u00a0Therefore, on December 31, 2007, we revised our license agreement which had the effect of: (i) revising the royalty rate from 85% of ICM's pretax income to 20% of ICM's gross revenues; (ii) extending the term of the license agreement to perpetuity; and (iii) removing the Company's obligation to fund ICM pursuant to the license agreement. Under current projections which were reviewed by an independent valuation firm, such modification is expected to yield substantially similar cash flows in the near future. \u00a0\u00a0, 59258=General and administrative expense in 2006 included the following:, 164209=9/21/2006, 36797=Our operating cash outflows were $214,353 for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $1,012,341 for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $797,988 \u00a0We experienced a smaller amount of net cash outflows in 2007 due to the cash flows generated by our licensee, ICM, that was consolidated until December 31, 2007. \u00a0We have reduced cash flows from operating expenses in each of the last two quarters and generated positive operating cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2007. \u00a0Our net cash outflows are significantly different than our net income due to the substantial amount of non-cash expenses, particularly stock-based compensation., 65363=Factors that impact the amount of professional fees to be incurred include the rate of growth of our business, the impact of new compliance requirements such as the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the expansion of our business, the number of key business functions to be outsourced, and the amount of legal actions to be taken and/or defended., 161091=4/23/2007, 120449=2006, 49913=Other income (expense) in 2007 consisted primarily of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. \u00a0In 2006, other income (expense) consisted primarily of $114,706 of accrued liquidated damages incurred in connection with the registration rights agreements associated with our preferred stock offerings in 2006, offset by $42,595 of interest income. \u00a0, 45348=Income tax provision in 2007 relates primarily to income taxes incurred by our licensee ICM that was consolidated until December 31, 2007. \u00a0We are in a taxable loss position with respect to our United States operations but are unable to apply those losses against the taxable income of ICM. \u00a0As ICM will no longer be consolidated, we do not expect to incur income tax expense in the immediate future., 187095=The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995), within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. \u00a0The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. \u00a0These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"could,\" \"is likely,\" or \"anticipates,\" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. \u00a0The Company wishes to caution the reader that these forward-looking statements that are not historical facts are only predictions. \u00a0No assurances can be given that the future results indicated, whether expressed or implied, will be achieved. \u00a0While sometimes presented with numerical specificity, these projections and other forward-looking statements are based upon a variety of assumptions relating to the business of the Company, which, although considered reasonable by the Company, may not be realized. \u00a0Because of the number and range of assumptions underlying the Company's projections and forward-looking statements, many of which are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies that are beyond the reasonable control of the Company, some of the assumptions inevitably will not materialize, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur subsequent to the date of this report.

structure of our licensing activities and, specifically, our licensing arrangement with ICM, our Board of Directors consulted with management and outside valuation experts and determined that a revision of the license agreement was in our best interests. \u00a0Therefore, on December 31, 2007, we revised our license agreement which had the effect of: (i) revising the royalty rate from 85% of ICM's pretax income to 20% of ICM's gross revenues; (ii) extending the term of the license agreement to perpetuity; and (iii) removing the Company's obligation to fund ICM pursuant to the license agreement. Under current projections which were reviewed by an independent valuation firm, such modification is expected to yield substantially similar cash flows in the near future. \u00a0\u00a0Because of his involvement with ICM, Dr. Neil H.

Our first licensee, ICM in San Jose, Costa Rica, an entity controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, began revenue generating activities in the third quarter of 2006. \u00a0A second licensee subscribed to our model four months later in January 2007 with its base of operations located in Mexico. \u00a0However, due to a lack of sufficient development of a market by the licensee, we expect to terminate the Mexican license agreement in 2008. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 5937=In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (\"SFAS No. 157\"). SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting procedures and expands disclosures on fair value measurements. This statement applies under previously established valuation pronouncements and does not require the changing of any fair value measurements, though it may cause some valuation procedures to change. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value is established by the price that would be received to sell the item or the amount to be paid to transfer the liability of the asset as opposed to the price to be paid for the asset or received to transfer the liability. Further, it defines fair value as a market specific valuation as opposed to an entity specific valuation, though the statement does recognize that there may be instances when the low amount of market activity for a particular item or liability may challenge an entity's ability to establish a market amount. In the instances that the item is restricted, this pronouncement states that the owner of the asset or liability should take into consideration what effects the restriction would have if viewed from the perspective of the buyer or assumer of the liability. This statement is effective for all assets valued in financial statements for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its financial position and result of operations., 41610=Net losses in 2007 and 2006 are attributable to expenses incurred in the development of our business. \u00a0A substantial amount of this net loss is attributable to $1,517,314 and $2,596,565 in stock based compensation for the years ended 2007 and 2006, respectively, as previously described. \u00a0, 159784=(1) The use of \"US\" in this column indicates that a patent application was filed with the United States PTO.

SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting procedures and expands disclosures on fair value measurements. This statement applies under previously established valuation pronouncements and does not require the changing of any fair value measurements, though it may cause some valuation procedures to change. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value is established by the price that would be received to sell the item or the amount to be paid to transfer the liability of the asset as opposed to the price to be paid for the asset or received to transfer the liability. Further, it defines fair value as a market specific valuation as opposed to an entity specific valuation, though the statement does recognize that there may be instances when the low amount of market activity for a particular item or liability may challenge an entity's ability to establish a market amount. In the instances that the item is restricted, this pronouncement states that the owner of the asset or liability should take into consideration what affects the restriction would have if viewed from the perspective of the buyer or assumer of the liability. This statement is effective for all assets valued in financial statements for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.

SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 are products of a joint project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board. \u00a0The revised standards continue the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting. SFAS No. 141(R) will significantly change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. These changes include the expensing of acquisition related costs and restructuring costs when incurred, the recognition of all assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value during a step-acquisition, and the recognition of contingent consideration as of the acquisition date if it is more likely than not to be incurred. \u00a0SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. \u00a0SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 are effective for both public and private companies for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (January 1, 2009 for companies with calendar year-ends). SFAS No. 141(R) will be applied prospectively. SFAS No. 160 requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests.
