    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6058=FIG. 3 indicates that the albumin binding peptide can alter the toxicity of a drug conjugate. Ab.Fab4D5-H-vc-MMAE (containing the albumin binding peptide) was significantly less toxic in rats than Fab4D5-vc-MMAE at Study Day 5. The group average change in body weight in animals administered 5.7 mg/kg rhuFab4D5-val-cit-MMAE and 7.85 mglkg rhuFab4D5-H-val-cit-MMAE (Groups 3 and 5) were not significantly different from each other. Dose groups 2, 4, and 6 (20.2 mg/kg Herceptin\ufffd-val-cit-MMAE, 14.24 mg/kg rhuFab4D5-val-cit-MMAE, and 19.62 mg/kg rhuFab4D5-H-val-cit-MMAE, respectively) all received 2105 ug/M2 MMAE. The group average decrease in body weight in Group 2 and 4 animals was more severe than group 6 animals.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{197138=To determine the affinity of albumin binding peptide conjugated to Fab molecules (Fab-H) to Albumin, we developed two types of ELISA. The first format involved the adsorption of albumin to the well surface and the bound Fab is detected with goat-anti-huFab-HRP. The second format involves the binding of Fab-H with albumin in solution and determines the dissociation constant (Kd). The basic principle of the second assay is to allow the binding, of a constant concentration of Fab-H to varying amount of albumin, to reach equilibrium in solution, and determine the un-bound Fab-H in ELISA well coated with albumin. The Kd value can be determined by analyzing the data using Scatchard Analysis (Munson et al., 1980, Anal. Biochem., 107: 220), 146208=SABMs of the invention can be prepared conveniently using solid-phase peptide synthesis. Merrifield, 1964, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149; Houghten, 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5132. Solid-phase peptide synthesis also can be used to prepare the conjugate molecule compositions of the invention if the TAs is or comprises a polypeptide., 141426=Examples of useful mammalian host cells include monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC.CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al. 1977, J. Gen Virol. 36:59); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR (CHO, Urlaub and Chasin 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:4216); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather 1980, Biol. Reprod. 23:243-251); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al 1982, Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 383:44-68); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2). For expression in mammalian host cells, useful vectors include vectors derived from SV40, vectors derived from cytomegalovirus such as the pRK vectors, including pRK5 and pRK7 (Suva et al. 1987, Science 237:893-896; EP 307,247 (Mar. 15, 1989), EP 278,776 (Aug. 17, 1988)) vectors derived from vaccinia viruses or other pox viruses, and retroviral vectors such as vectors derived from Moloney's murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)., 185414=In sum, Herceptin\ufffd F(ab\u2032)2-val-cit-MMAE (lysine) caused acute toxicity in a dose-dependent fashion. Animals in the high dose Herceptin\ufffd F(ab\u2032)2-val-cit-MMAE showed a significantly greater weight loss compared with animals receiving the same amount of drug as Herceptin\ufffd-val-cit-MMAE. Animals administered free MMAE at a comparable dose (2150 ug/m2) to the high dose of Herceptin\ufffd F(ab\u2032)2-val-cit-MMAE had comparable weight loss and changes in liver associated serum enzyme levels and white blood cell and platelet counts. The findings are consistent with the administration of agents that inhibit tubulin formation (Wood K W, Cornwell W D, and Jackson J R. Past and future of the mitotic spindle as an oncology target. Current Opinion in Pharmacology, 1:370-377. 2001)., 207552=The affinity measurement using ELISA was first published by Friguet et. al. in 1985. We have used this methodology in determining the Kd and selecting humanized antibody to HER2 ECD. (Carter et. Al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 89, 4285, 1992 )., 165029=The liquid aerosol formulations of the present invention will typically be used with a nebulizer. The nebulizer can be either compressed air driven or ultrasonic. Any nebulizer known in the art can be used in conjunction with the present invention such as but not limited to: Ultravent, Mallinckrodt, Inc. (St. Louis, Mo.); the Acorn II nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products, Englewood Colo.). Other nebulizers useful in conjunction with the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,624,251 issued Nov. 25, 1986; U.S. Pat. No. 3,703,173 issued Nov. 21, 1972; U.S. Pat. No. 3,561,444 issued Feb. 9, 1971 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,635,627 issued Jan. 13, 1971., 87813=The term \u201ccytotoxic agent\u201d as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The cytotoxic agent should be capable of being internalized and/or capable of inhibiting cell growth from outside the cell without necessarily binding to the cell surface. According to one preferred embodiment, the agent is a small molecule. According to another embodiment, the active portion of the cytotoxic agent is 1100 KD or less. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g. At211, I131, I125, Y90, Re186, Re188, Sm153, Bi212, B213, P32 and radioactive isotopes of Lu), chemotherapeutic agents e.g. methotrexate, adriamicin, vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide), doxorubicin, melphalan, mitomycin C, chlorambucil, daunorubicin, or other intercalating agents, enzymes and fragments thereof such as nucleolytic enzymes, antibiotics, and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, (e.g., MMAE) including fragments and/or variants thereof, and the various antitumor or anticancer agents or grow inhibitory agents disclosed below. Other cytotoxic agents are described below. According to one preferred embodiment, the cytotoxic agent is not a radioisotope., 136034=The present invention encompasses a composition of matter comprising an isolated nucleic acid, preferably DNA, encoding a SABM or a conjugate molecule comprising a SABM and a polypeptide TAs as described herein. DNAs encoding the peptides of the invention can be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, chemical synthesis by any of the methods described in Engels et al. 1989, Agnew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 28:716-734 (the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) such as the triester, phosphite, phosphoramidite, and H-phosphonate chemical synthesis methods. In one embodiment, codons preferred by the expression host cell are used in the design of the encoding DNA. Alternatively, DNA encoding the peptides can be altered to encode one or more variants by using recombinant DNA techniques, such as site specific mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1991, Methods Enzymol., 204:125-139; Carter et al. 1986, Nucl. Acids Res. 13:4331; Zoller et al. 1982, Nucl. Acids Res. 10:6487), cassette mutagenesis (Wells et al. 1985, Gene 34:315), restriction selection mutagenesis (Carter, 1991, In: Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach, M. J. McPherson, ed., IRL Press, Oxford), and the like., 67807=TAs are amino acid sequences as described above that may contain naturally as well as non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, such as phage-display derived antibodies. So-called \u201cpeptide mimetics\u201d and \u201cpeptide analogs\u201d, that include non-amino acid chemical structures that mimic the structure of a particular amino acid or peptide, can be TAs within the context of the invention. Such mimetics or analogs are characterized generally as exhibiting similar physical characteristics such as size, charge or hydrophobicity present in the appropriate spatial orientation as found in their peptide counterparts. A specific example of a peptide mimetic compound is a compound in which the amide bond between one or more of the amino acids is replaced by, for example, a carbon-carbon bond or other bond as is well known in the art (see, for example Sawyer, 1995, In: Peptide Based Drug Design pp. 378-422, ACS, Wash. DC)., 75990=SABMs and TAs within the context of the present invention may be \u201cengineered\u201d, i.e., can be non-native or non-naturally occurring TAs. By \u201cnon-native\u201d or \u201cnon-naturally occurring\u201d is meant that the amino acid sequence of the particular SABM is not found in nature. That is to say, amino acid sequences of non-native or non-naturally occurring TAs or SABMs need not correspond to an amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring protein or polypeptide. TAs or SABMs of this variety may be produced or selected using a variety of techniques, including those well known to the skilled artisan. For example, constrained or unconstrained peptide libraries may be randomly generated and displayed on phage utilizing art standard techniques, for example, Lowman et al., 1998, Biochemistry 37:8870-8878., 135263=One skilled in the art will recognize that various combinations of atoms provide for variable length molecules based upon known distances between various bonds. See, for example, Morrison and Boyd, 1997, Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed., Allyn and Bacon, Inc., Boston, Mass. The linker domain may be a polypeptide of variable length. The amino acid composition of the polypeptide determines the character and length of the linker. In a preferred embodiment, the linker molecule comprises a flexible, hydrophilic polypeptide chain. Exemplary linker domains comprise one or more Gly and/or Ser residues, such as those described in the Example sections below., 186645=Female rats were administered equivalent doses (2105 ug MMAE/m2) via tail-vein injections at a dose volume of 10 ml/kg (diluted in PBS). All dose solutions were administered as a single bolus injection., 66628=A \u201ctargeting agent\u201d or \u201cTA\u201d of the present invention will bind a target molecule on the surface of a cell with sufficient affinity and specificity if the TA \u201chomes\u201d to, \u201cbinds\u201d or \u201ctargets\u201d a target molecule such as a specific cell type bearing the target molecule in vitro and preferably in vivo (see, for example, the use of the term \u201chomes to,\u201d \u201choming,\u201d and \u201ctargets\u201d in Pasqualini and Ruoslahti, 1996 Nature, 380:364-366 and Arap et al., 1998 Science, 279:377-380). In general, the TA will bind a target molecule with an affinity characterized by a dissociation constant, Kd, of less than about 10 microM, preferably less than about 100 nM and less than about 10 nM. However, polypeptides or small molecules having an affinity for a target molecule of less than about 1 nM and preferably between about 1 pM and 1 nM are equally likely to be TAs within the context of the present invention. Preferably, the TA is a polypeptide (e.g., an antibody). In general, a TA that binds a particular target molecule as described above can be isolated and identified by any of a number of techniques known in the art., 126223=(a) Radioisotopes, such as 35S, 14C, 125I, 3H, and 131I. The SABM can be labeled with the radioisotope using techniques described in Coligen et al., 1991, eds., Current Protocols in Immunology, Volumes 1 and 2, Wiley-Interscience, New York, N.Y., for example. Radioactivity can be measured using scintillation counting., 34955=ZEVALIN\ufffd (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen Idec Inc.) is an antibody-radioisotope conjugate composed of a murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and 111In or 90Y radioisotope bound by a thiourea linker-chelator (Wiseman et al (2000) Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 27(7):766-77; Wiseman et al (2002) Blood 99(12): 4336-42; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(10):2453-63; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(15):3262-69). Although ZEVALIN\ufffd has activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. MYLOTARG\u2122 (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), an antibody drug conjugate composed of a CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection (Drugs of the Future (2000) 25(7):686; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,970,198; 5,079,233; 5,585,089; 5,606,040; 5,693,762; 5,739,116; 5,767,285; 5,773,001). Cantuzumab mertansine (Immunogen, Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the huC242 antibody linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1 (Xie et al (2004) J. of Pharm. and Exp. Ther. 308(3):1073-1082), is advancing into Phase II trials for the treatment of cancers that express CanAg, such as colon, pancreatic, gastric, and others. MLN-2704 (Millennium Pharm., BZL Biologics, Immunogen Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM 1, is under development for the potential treatment of prostate tumors., 129862=In some phage display ELISA assays, binding affinity of a mutated (\u201cmut\u201d) sequence was directly compared of a control (\u201ccon\u201d) peptide using methods described in Cunningham et al., 1994, EMBO J. 13:2508, and characterized by the parameter EC50. Assays were performed under conditions where EC50(con)/EC50(mut) will approximate Kd(con)/Kd(mut)., 89276=A \u201cchemotherapeutic agent\u201d is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents such as thiotepa and CYTOXAN\ufffd cyclosphosphamide; alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan, improsulfan and piposulfan; aziridines such as benzodopa, carboquone, meturedopa, and uredopa; ethylenimines and methylamelamines including altretamine, triethylenemelamine, trietylenephosphoramide, triethiylenethiophosphoramide and trimethylolomelamine; acetogenins (especially bullatacin and bullatacinone); a camptothecin (including the synthetic analogue topotecan); bryostatin; callystatin; CC-1065 (including its adozelesin, carzelesin and bizelesin synthetic analogues); cryptophycins (particularly cryptophycin 1 and cryptophycin 8); dolastatin; duocarmycin (including the synthetic analogues, KW-2189 and CB1-TM1); eleutherobin; pancratistatin; a sarcodictyin; spongistatin; nitrogen mustards such as chlorambucil, chlornaphazine, cholophosphamide, estramustine, ifosfamide, mechlorethamine, mechlorethamine oxide hydrochloride, melphalan, novembichin, phenesterine, prednimustine, trofosfamide, uracil mustard; nitrosureas such as carmustine, chlorozotocin, fotemustine, lomustine, nimustine, and ranimnustine; antibiotics such as the enediyne antibiotics (e. g., calicheamicin, especially calicheamicin gamma1I and calicheamicin omegaI1 (see, e.g., Agnew, Chem Intl. Ed. Engl., 33: 183-186 (1994)); dynemicin, including dynemicin A; bisphosphonates, such as clodronate; an esperamicin; as well as neocarzinostatin chromophore and related chromoprotein enediyne antiobiotic chromophores), aclacinomysins, actinomycin, authramycin, azaserine, bleomycins, cactinomycin, carabicin, carminomycin, carzinophilin, chromomycinis, dactinomycin, daunorubicin, detorubicin, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine, ADRIAMYCIN\ufffd doxorubicin (including morpholino-doxorubicin, cyanomorpholino-doxorubicin, 2-pyrrolino-doxorubicin and deoxydoxorubicin), epirubicin, esorubicin, idarubicin, marcellomycin, mitomycins such as mitomycin C, mycophenolic acid, nogalamycin, olivomycins, peplomycin, potfiromycin, puromycin, quelamycin, rodorubicin, streptonigrin, streptozocin, tubercidin, ubenimex, zinostatin, zorubicin; anti-metabolites such as methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); folic acid analogues such as denopterin, methotrexate, pteropterin, trimetrexate; purine analogs such as fludarabine, 6-mercaptopurine, thiamiprine, thioguanine; pyrimidine analogs such as ancitabine, azacitidine, 6-azauridine, carmofur, cytarabine, dideoxyuridine, doxifluridine, enocitabine, floxuridine; androgens such as calusterone, dromostanolone propionate, epitiostanol, mepitiostane, testolactone; anti- adrenals such as aminoglutethimide, mitotane, trilostane; folic acid replenisher such as frolinic acid; aceglatone; aldophosphamide glycoside; aminolevulinic acid; eniluracil; amsacrine; bestrabucil; bisantrene; edatraxate; defofamine; demecolcine; diaziquone; elfornithine; elliptinium acetate; an epothilone; etoglucid; gallium nitrate; hydroxyurea; lentinan; lonidainine; maytansinoids such as maytansine and ansamitocins; mitoguazone; mitoxantrone; mopidanmol; nitraerine; pentostatin; phenamet; pirarubicin; losoxantrone; podophyllinic acid; 2- ethylhydrazide; procarbazine; PSK\ufffd polysaccharide complex (JHS Natural Products, Eugene, Oreg.); razoxane; rhizoxin; sizofiran; spirogermanium; tenuazonic acid; triaziquone; 2,2\u2032,2\u2033-trichlorotriethylamine; trichothecenes (especially T-2 toxin, verracurin A, roridin A and anguidine); urethan; vindesine; dacarbazine; mannomustine; mitobronitol; mitolactol; pipobroman; gacytosine; arabinoside (\u201cAra-C\u201d); cyclophosphamide; thiotepa; taxoids, e.g., TAXOL\ufffd paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers Squibb Oncology, Princeton, N.J.), ABRAXANETM Cremophor-free, albumin-engineered nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel (American Pharmaceutical Partners, Schaumberg, Ill.), and TAXOTERE\ufffd doxetaxel (Rh\ufffdne-Poulenc Rorer, Antony, France); chloranbucil; GEMZAR\ufffd gemcitabine; 6-thioguanine; mercaptopurine; methotrexate; platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin; vinblastine; platinum; etoposide (VP-16); ifosfamide; mitoxantrone; vincristine; NAVELBINE\ufffd vinorelbine; novantrone; teniposide; edatrexate; daunomycin; aminopterin; xeloda; ibandronate; CPT-11; topoisomerase inhibitor RFS 2000; difluorometlhylomithine (DMFO); retinoids such as retinoic acid; capecitabine; oxaliplatin, including the oxaliplatin treatment regimen (FOLFOX); inhibitors of PKC-alpha, Raf, H-Ras, and EGFR (e.g., erlotinib (Tarceva\u2122)) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, acids or derivatives of any of the above., 37950=The use of albumin binding polypeptides have also been investigated. Extended in vivo half-times of human soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) fused to the albumin binding domains from Streptococcal protein G have been reported (Makrides et al. 1996 J. Phannacol. Exptl. Ther. 277:532-541). Labelled albumin binding domains of protein G have been described (EP 0 486,525). Several phage diplay-derived albumin binding peptides have been described by applicant. See WO 01/45746, United States Patent Publication No. 2004/0001827, and Dennis, M S, et al., (2002) JBC 277(38):35035-43. In theory, serum albumin binding peptides associate with serum albumin non-covalently in vivo. As such, the serum albumin binding peptides are necessarily a step removed from the in vivo cycling mechanism of serum albumin itself., 36732=Various methods have been tried to improve the half life of small molecule or biological therapeutics. For example, glycosylation sites have been introduced to the molecules (Keyt et. al., 1994, PNAS USA 91:3670-74), and molecules have been conjugated with PEG (Clark et.al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem., 271: 21969-77; Lee et. al, 1999, Bioconjugate Chem. 10:973-981; Tanaka et. al., 1991, Cancer Res. 51:3710-14) to increase size and increase elimination half-times. Some have attempted to use human serum albumin to improve the therapeutic use of the drug. For example, albumin has been attached to small molecules (Syed et. al., 1997, Blood 89:3243-3252; Burger et. al., 2001 Int. J. Cancer 92:718-724; Wosikowski K, et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2003 May 9(5):1917-26); CD4 (Yeh et. al., 1992, PNAS USA 89:1904-1908); the Fc portion of an IgG (Ashkenazi et. al. (1997) Curr. Opin in Immunol. 9:195-200), IL-2 (Yao, Z et al., (2004 May) Cancer Immunol Immunother. 53(5):404-10) and the bridge between an anti-gp72 antibody and a methotrexate molecule (Affleck, K et al., (1992) Br J Cancer.65(6):838-44)., 55020=According to one embodiment, the anti-HER2 antibody comprises variants of the light chain variable sequence SEQ ID NO:428 and heavy chain variable sequence SEQ ID NO:429, wherein at least one or more of the amino acids selected from the group consisting of D28(VL), N30(VL), T31(VL), A32(VL), Y49(VL), F53(VL), Y55(VL), R66(VL), H91(VL), Y92(VL), T94(VL), W95(VH), D98(VH), F100(VH); Y100a(VH), and Y102(VH), numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, are substituted with any amino acid other than alanine.

According to another embodiment, the anti-HER2 antibody is any anti-HER2 antibody disclosed in United States Patent Publication No. 2003/0228663 A1, filed Apr. 9, 2003; WO 03/087131; Carter et al., (1992) PNAS 89:4285-4289 which publications are expressly incorporated by reference herein., 69956=The \u201cCD20\u201d antigen is non-glycosylated phosphoprotein found on the surface of greater than 90% of B cells from peripheral blood or lymphoid organs. CD20 is expressed during early pre-B cell development and remains until plasma cell differentiation. CD20 is present on both normal B cells as well as malignant B cells. Other names for CD20 in the literature include \u201cB-lymphocyte-restricted antigen\u201d B1 and \u201cBp35\u201d. The CD20 antigen is described in Clark et al.

X12530 and Swissprot P11836., 32434=Attempts have been made to use antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), to locally deliver cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, i.e. drugs that kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer (Payne, G. (2003) Cancer Cell 3:207-212; Syrigos and Epenetos (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614; Niculescu-Duvaz and Springer (1997) Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 26:151-172; U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278). Theoretically, the drug moiety will be targeted to the tumors and be internalized, wherein systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells (Baldwin et al., (1986) Lancet pp. (Mar. 15, 1986):603-05; Thorpe, (1985) \u201cAntibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,\u201d in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, A. Pinchera et al. (ed.s), pp. 475-506)., 71415=The \u201cCD19\u201d antigen refers to an antigen identified, for example, by the HD237-CD19 or B4 antibody (Kiesel et al. Leukemia Research II, 12: 1119 (1987)). CD19 is found on Pro-B, pre-B, immature and mature, activated and memory B cells, up to a point just prior to terminal differentiation into plasma cells. Neither CD19 nor CD20 is expressed on hematopoietic stem cell or plasma cell. Binding of an antagonist to CD19 may cause internalization of the CD19 antigen. The amino acid sequence of human CD19 is shown in The Leukocyte Antigen Facts Book, Barclay et al. supra, page 180, and also EMBL Genbank accession no. M28170 and Swissprot P11836., 87135=Humanized anti-ErbB2 (HER2) antibodies include huMAb4D5-1, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 and huMAb4D5-8 (HERCEPTIN7) as described in Table 3 of U.S. Pat.

Throughout the disclosure, the terms \u201chuMAb4D5-8\u201d and \u201chu4D5-8\u201d are used interchangeably., 68778=A \u201cB cell surface marker\u201d or \u201cB cell surface antigen\u201d herein is an antigen expressed on the surface of a B cell which can be targeted with an antagonist which binds thereto. Exemplary B cell surface markers include the CD10, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD24, CD37, CD40, CD53, CD72, CD73, CD74, CDw75, CDw76, CD77, CDw78, CD79a, CD79b, CD80, CD81, CD82, CD83, CDw84, CD85 and CD86 leukocyte surface markers (for descriptions, see The Leukocyte Antigen Facts Book, 2nd Edition. 1997, ed.

Chemical Synthesis Another method of producing the SABMs of the invention involves chemical synthesis. This can be accomplished by using methodologies well known in the art (see Kelley and Winkler, 1990, In: Genetic Engineering Principles and Methods, Setlow, J. K, ed., Plenum Press, N.Y., Vol. 12, pp 1-19; Stewart, et al., 1984, J. M. Young, J. D., Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,105,603; 3,972,859; 3,842,067; and 3,862,925)., 104856=\u201cElimination half-time\u201d is used in its ordinary sense, as is described in Goodman and Gillman's The Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics, pp. 21-25 Alfred Goodman Gilman, Louis S. Goodman, and Alfred Gilman, eds., 6th ed. 1980. Briefly, the term is meant to encompass a quantitative measure of the time course of drug elimination. The elimination of most drugs is exponential (i.e., follows first-order kinetics), since drug concentrations usually do not approach those required for saturation of the elimination process. The rate of an exponential process may be expressed by its rate constant, k, which expresses the fractional change per unit of time, or by its half-time, t1/2, the time required for 50% completion of the process. The units of these two constants are time\u22121 and time, respectively. A first-order rate constant and the half-time of the reaction are simply related (k\ufffdt1/2=0.693) and may be interchanged accordingly. Since first-order elimination kinetics dictates that a constant fraction of drug is lost per unit time, a plot of the log of drug concentration versus time is linear at all times following the initial distribution phase (i.e. after drug absorption and distribution are complete). The half-time for drug elimination can be accurately determined from such a graph. According to one preferred embodiment of this invention, the conjugate molecules of this invention have a longer half-life and lower toxicity than conjugate molecules that lack the SABM., 171735=A single intravenous dose of 1650 \u03bcg MMAE/m2 rhuAB.Fab-4D5-H-vc-MMAE (i.e., with AB), rhuFab4D5vcMMAE (i.e., without AB), or rhuABFabATFL-vc-MMAE (negative control) was given to mMMTV-HER2 Fo5 tumor bearing mice. Each treated mouse had a mean tumor volume between 100 and 200 mm3. The MMAE-conjugated molecules or a phosphate buffer saline (\u201cvehicle\u201d) were administered on day 0 of the study and tumor measurements were performed twice weekly for 17 days. A known efficacious MMAE conjugate, Herceptin\ufffd-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was run for comparison at a dose of 1245 \u03bcg/m2 MMAE. Log Cell Kill analyses based on tumor doubling times were conducted. The Log Cell Kill analysis uses a mathematical computation of tumor growth delay based on the time it takes for tumors to double in size after treatment begins compared to controls. The mathematical equation is:, 179443=For the Herceptin\ufffd-val-cit-MMAE, the \u03bcg MMAE/m2 was calculated using 718 as the MW of MMAE and 145167 as the MW of Herceptin\ufffd. For the Herceptin\ufffd F(ab\u2032)2-val-cit-MMAE, the \u03bcg MMAE/m2 was calculated using 718 as the MW of MMAE and 100000 as the MW of Herceptin\ufffd F(ab\u2032)2. The body surface area was calculated as follows: [{(body weight in grams to 0.667 power)\ufffd11.8}/10000]. (Guidance for Industry and Reviewers. Estimating the Safety Starting Dose in Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers. U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Center for Biologics Evaluation and research (CBER), December 2002)., 170098=The resulting construct was expressed and secreted from E. coli as a fusion protein (\u201cAB.Fab4D5-H\u201d or \u201crhuABFabATFL\u201d), then isolated and purified. Next, the fusion proteins were conjugated to monomethylauristatin (MMAE). For the tumor efficacy study, the fusion proteins were attached to MMAE via a valine-citrulline (val-cit or vc) dipeptide Linker reagent having a maleimide moiety and a para-aminobenzylcarbamoyl (PAB) spacer. See Klussman, K et al., (2004) Bioconjugate Chem. 15:765-773 for an example of methods for attaching MMAE to antibodies. For the toxicity study, the fusion proteins were attached to MMAE via, for example, conjugation with an MMAE modified with an activated derivative of maleimidocaproyl through their lysines using succinimidyl acetylthioacetate (Sata) to generate free thiols followed by conjugation to valine-citrulline-MMAE (\u201cvc-MMAE\u201d). The ratio of MMAE on the resulting AB.Fab4D5-H was generally an average around 1:1 with ratios as high as 4:1 and as low as 0:1 such that between 0-4 MMAE moieties were randomly distributed on exposed lysines, the overall average being about 1 MMAE per AB.Fab4D5-H., 187519=In a previous study, the 2105 ug MMAE/m2 dose of Herceptin\ufffd-val-cit-MMAE resulted in changes in liver associated serum enzyme levels and hematology parameters that were moderately severe. Doses of 5.7 mg/kg rhuFab4D5-val-cit-MMAE and 7.85 mg/kg rhuFab4D5-H-val-cit-MMAE were also administered in the present study to give an MMAE exposure of approximately 840 ug MMAE/m2., 143892=The mammalian host cells used to produce peptides of the invention can be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in the art (for example, Ham and Wallace, 1979, Meth. Enz. 58:44; Barnes and Sato 1980, Anal. Biochem. 102:255, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; or 4,560,655; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; U.S. Pat. Re. 30,985; or U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,469, the disclosure of each is incorporated herein by reference) may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleosides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as Gentamycin\u2122 drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan., 106879=\u201cTransformation\u201d means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosornal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in section 1.82 of Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning (2nd ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY, is generally used for prokaryotes or other cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens is used for transformation of certain plant cells, as described by Shaw et al., 1983 Gene, 23:315 and WO 89/05859, published 29 Jun. 1989. For mammalian cells without such cell walls, the calcium phosphate precipitation method described in sections 16.30-16.37 of Sambrook et al., supra, is preferred. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transformations have been described by Axel in U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,216, issued 16 Aug. 1983. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van Solingen et al., 1977, J. Bact., 130:946 and Hsiao et al., 1979, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 76:3829. However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells such as by nuclear injection, electroporation, or by protoplast fusion may also be used., 31604=This application is a non-provisional application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b)(1), claiming priority under 35 USC 119(e) to provisional application No. 60/641,534 filed on Jan. 5, 2005 and 60/616,507 filed on Oct. 5, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference., 72855=Therefore, the term \u201camino acid\u201d within the scope of the present invention is used in its broadest sense and is meant to include naturally occurring L alpha-amino acids or residues. The commonly used one and three letter abbreviations for naturally occurring amino acids are used herein (Lehninger, A. L., 1975, Biochemistry, 2d ed., pp. 71-92, Worth Publishers, New York). The correspondence between the standard single letter codes and the standard three letter codes is well known to the skilled artisan, and is reproduced here: A=Ala; C=Cys; D=Asp; E=Glu; F=Phe; G=Gly; H=His; I=lie; K=Lys; L=Leu; M=Met; N=Asn; P=Pro; Q=Gln; R=Arg; S=Ser; T=Thr; V=Val; W=Trp; Y=Tyr. The term includes D-amino acids as well as chemically modified amino acids such as amino acid analogs, naturally occurring amino acids that are not usually incorporated into proteins such as norleucine, and chemically synthesized compounds having properties known in the art to be characteristic of an amino acid. For example, analogs or mimetics of phenylalanine or proline, that allow the same conformational restriction of the peptide compounds as natural Phe or Pro, are included within the definition of amino acid. Such analogs and mimetics are referred to herein as \u201cfunctional equivalents\u201d of an amino acid. Other examples of amino acids are listed by Roberts and Vellaccio, 1983, In: The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology, Gross and Meiehofer, eds., Vol. 5 p. 341, Academic Press, Inc., N.Y., which is incorporated herein by reference., 74435=SABMs and TAs synthesized, for example, by standard solid phase synthesis techniques, are not limited to amino acids encoded by genes. Commonly encountered amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code, include, for example, those described in International Publication No. WO 90/01940 such as, for example, 2-amino adipic acid (Aad) for Glu and Asp; 2-aminopimelic acid (Apm) for Glu and Asp; 2-aminobutyric (Abu) acid for Met, Leu, and other aliphatic amino acids; 2-aminoheptanoic acid (Ahe) for Met, Leu and other aliphatic amino acids; 2-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) for Gly; cyclohexylalanine (Cha) for Val, and Leu and Ile; homoarginine (Har) for Arg and Lys; 2,3-diaminopropionic acid (Dpr) for Lys, Arg and His; N-ethylglycine (EtGly) for Gly, Pro, and Ala; N-ethylglycine (EtGly) for Gly, Pro, and Ala; N-ethylasparigine (EtAsn) for Asn, and Gln; Hydroxyllysine (Hyl) for Lys; allohydroxyllysine (AHyl) for Lys; 3-(and 4)-hydoxyproline (3Hyp, 4Hyp) for Pro, Ser, and Thr; allo-isoleucine (Alle) for Ile, Leu, and Val; \u03c1-amidinophenylalanine for Ala; N-methylglycine (MeGly, sarcosine) for Gly, Pro, and Ala; N-methylisoleucine (MeIle) for Ile; Norvaline (Nva) for Met and other aliphatic amino acids; Norleucine (Nle) for Met and other aliphatic amino acids; Ornithine (Orn) for Lys, Arg and His; Citrulline (Cit) and methionine sulfoxide (MSO) for Thr, Asn and Gln; N-methylphenylalanine (MePhe), trimethylphenylalanine, halo (F, Cl, Br, and I) phenylalanine, trifluorylphenylalanine, for Phe., 33363=Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been used in to make ADCs (Rowland et al., (1986) Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 21:183-87). Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate and vindesine (Rowland et al., (1986) supra). Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (Mandler et al (2000) J. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92(19):1573-1581; Mandler et al (2000) Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 10:1025-1028; Mandler et al (2002) Bioconjugate Chem. 13:786-791), maytansinoids (EP 1391213; Liu et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-8623), and calicheamicin (Lode et al (1998) Cancer Res. 58:2928; Hinman et al (1993) Cancer Res. 53:3336-3342). More recently, auristatin peptides, auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin (MMAE) and synthetic analogs of dolastatin (WO 02/088172), have been conjugated to full length antibodies (e.g., Klussman, et al (2004), Bioconjugate Chemistry 15(4):765-773; Doronina et al (2003) Nature Biotechnology 21(7):778-784; Francisco et al (2003) Blood 102(4):1458-1465; US 2004/0018194; WO 04/032828; Mao, et al (2004) Cancer Res. 64(3):781-788; Bhaskar et al (2003) Cancer Res. 63:6387-6394; WO 03/043583; Mao et al (2004) Cancer Res. 64:781-788). Variants of auristatin E are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,237; U.S. Pat. No. 6124431., 142882=Optionally, DNA encoding the peptide of interest is operably linked to a secretory leader sequence resulting in secretion of the expression product by the host cell into the culture medium. Examples of secretory leader sequences include STII, ecotin, lamB, herpes GD, 1 pp, alkaline phosphatase, invertase, and alpha factor. Also suitable for use herein is the 36 amino acid leader sequence of protein A (Abrahmsen et al. 1985, EMBO J. 4:3901)., 155203=As described above, some embodiments of the invention include cyclized SABMs. SABMs may be cyclized by formation of a disulfide bond between cysteine residues. Such peptides can be made by chemical synthesis as described above and then cyclized by any convenient method used in the formation of disulfide linkages. For example, peptides can be recovered from solid phase synthesis with sulfhydryls in reduced form, dissolved in a dilute solution wherein the intramolecular cysteine concentration exceeds the intermolecular cysteine concentration in order to optimize intramolecular disulfide bond formation, such as a peptide concentration of 25 mM to 1 uM, and preferably 500 uM to 1 uM, and more preferably 25 uM to 1 uM, and then oxidized by exposing the free sulfhydryl groups to a mild oxidizing agent that is sufficient to generate intramolecular disulfide bonds, e.g., molecular oxygen with or without catalysts such as metal cations, potassium ferricyanide, sodium tetrathionate, and the like. Alternatively, the peptides can be cyclized as described in Pelton et al., 1986, J. Med. Chem. 29:2370-2375., 139714=For expression in prokaryotic hosts, suitable vectors include pBR322 (ATCC No. 37,017), phGH107 (ATCC No. 40,011), pBO475, pS0132, pRIT5, any vector in the pRIT20 or pRIT30 series (Nilsson and Abrahmsen 1990, Meth. Enzymol. 185:144-161), pRIT2T, pKK233-2, pDR540, and pPL-lambda. Prokaryotic host cells containing the expression vectors of the present invention include E. coli K12 strain 294 (ATCC NO. 31,446), E. coli strain JM11 (Messing et al. 1981, Nucl. Acid Res. 9:309), E. coli strain B, E. coli Strain\u20141776 (ATCC No. 31537), E. coli c600, E. coli W3110 (F-, gamma-, prototrophic, ATCC No. 27,325), E. coli strain 27C7 (W3110, tonA, phoA E15, (argF-lac)169, ptr3, degP41, ompT, kanr) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,931, ATCC No. 55,244), Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcesans, and Pseudomonas species., 161499=The liquid aerosol formulations generally contain the conjugate molecules and a dispersing agent in a physiologically acceptable diluent. The dry powder aerosol formulations of the present invention consist of a finely divided solid form of the conjugate molecule and a dispersing agent. With either the liquid or dry powder aerosol formulation, the formulation must be aerosolized. That is, it must be broken down into liquid or solid particles in order to ensure that the aerosolized dose actually reaches the alveoli. In general the mass median dynamic diameter will be 5 micrometers or less in order to ensure that the drug particles reach the lung alveoli (Wearley, 1991, Crit. Rev. in Ther. Drug Carrier Systems 8:333). The term \u201caerosol particle\u201d is used herein to describe the liquid or solid particle suitable for pulmonary administration, i.e., that will reach the alveoli. Other considerations such as construction of the delivery device, additional components in the formulation and particle characteristics are important. These aspects of pulmonary administration of a drug are well known in the art, and manipulation of formulations, aerosolization means and construction of a delivery device require at most routine experimentation by one of ordinary skill in the art.}",
