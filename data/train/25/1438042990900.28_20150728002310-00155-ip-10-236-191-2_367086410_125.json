The hold time (and thus the hello multiplier and the hello interval) can be set on an individual interface basis, and can be different between different networking devices in one area., 213969=Under normal conditions, the default MTU size should be sufficient. However, if the MTU size of a link is less than 1500 bytes, the LSP MTU size must be lowered accordingly on each router in the network. If this action is not taken, routing becomes unpredictable.}",

Command Modes Router configuration Interface configuration Command History Release Modification Release 3.7.2 This command was introduced. Release 3.9.0 Support for IPv6 was added. Usage Guidelines Use the address family command to place the router or interface in address family configuration mode. In router address family configuration mode, you can configure routing that uses standard IPv4 or IPv6 address prefixes. An address family must be specified in interface configuration mode. In interface address family configuration mode, you can alter interface parameters for IPv4or IPv6. You must specify an address family in order to configure parameters that pertain to a single address family. Task ID",
