            "Campus Safety is wonderful. There are usually two or three officers on duty, and the buildings are all secure. If ever you need anything, there are phone posts on campus where you can call campus safety and they will assist you. At the beginning of the year they asked all freshmen to put their number into their cell phones, in case we are no where near the phone posts. I feel very safe being on campus.",
            "There is no Greek life.",
            "This school is good for students who value community and a great education. Everyone here is here because they want to learn and be in a strong community.",
            "Every once in a while they do a Friday night activity called a Coffeehouse, when some type of singer comes and performs and there is a coffee bar with coffee, an alternative drink, and some type of snack. There are also some activities on Saturday nights hosted by the gym staff such as late night laser tag or ice skating. There's almost always something to do on campus, and if there is nothing that interests you, hanging out with friends is just as good!",
            "The food is excellent. There is a wide variety to choose from. There are two main lines which change every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Then there is a line from which you can get an omelet in the morning or Chinese food during lunch and dinner. Next to that line is the vegetarian line, then there's a station where you can get a sandwich or wrap. Then there is a grill where they have pizza or pasta and burgers or some type of warm sandwich. Those are the main options, but there are several other things to choose from. The dining space is quite nice, too. There are many places to sit and you can stay as long as you need/want to.",
            "The dorm life is not as bad as people say. I personally do not mind it that much. The rooms are a little small, but it is something you can easily adjust to. The bathrooms are shared by around twenty other girls, but there is seldom more than five or six girls in there at one time. And they are usually well kept. It's also nice having them co-ed. In the dorm I am in, the guys are on one side of the building and the girls on the other, and then there is a dividing door which is locked at night so no one can sneak in and out of the guy's and girl's wings.",
            "You have to be willing to do some work. There is usually reading that must be done for a majority of the classes, and of course there are tests and papers to be done. Many of the classes are discussion based, and it is expected that you have read the material and are prepared for class. It can be difficult sometimes, but the professors are more than willing to help find ways for you to succeed.",
            "Do not let the tuition scare you. Augustana wants to help students of all economic backgrounds, and there are many ways to receive financial help. Also, don't be afraid about the freshman label. At this school, it doesn't exist. People do not pay attention to the status and there are no cliques. Everyone is welcome here on campus.",
            "It's a wonderful school. Teachers and students are friendly and want to be helpful. I feel like I am getting a decent education."

However, this class is free to take and recommended to do so as no other college will offer a free course.

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Over night visits during the fall can be great fun. Due to the pure number of events on campus you are sure to enjoy your stay. Also, talk to you admissions representative. Our representatives are known for calling and checking in. Spend a little time chatting. They are a great resource. Bang for the buck Augustana College is one of the most inexpensive private, liberal art schools in the country. They strive to make the school affordable for each an every student. Additional expenses such as parking are a hidden bargain. Also, remember, cost of living in Sioux Falls is very reasonable. Think of down the road when you want to live off campus-reason rent is always available in Sioux Falls. Am enjoying being here Augustana has a strong sense of community. The freshman dorms allow for a strong sense of unity among classes. There is never a dull moment on campus. The student groups host an event almost every night. Am learning a lot Each professor strives to utilize text, lecture, and assignments to ensure each student truly dives into the subject matter. What truly sets Augustana College above and beyond on this level is the",
