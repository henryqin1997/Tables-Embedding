            "Emergency buttons in case of mugging or whatever are peppered throughout the campus. The campus police do their job well and send out reports via text messages to students about any potential danger and suspects in the area, which tends to be rare.",
            "Philadelphia is the fifth largest city in the U.S. There's going to be something to do with your friends if you're fine with walking a bit or taking the campus bus or paying for the subway.",
            "The meal plans are adequate. They include meal swipes, which are redeemed for a buffet at the dining center, and dining dollars, which can be spent at the campus market. Students can pick whether they want more of one or the other or neither. The dining center's food can be bland at times, but there are plenty of choices with about half of them cycling through every day. The campus market acts like a mini convenience store with Subway, Chick-fil-A, and Currito. The variety is slightly disappointing, but it's very close to the dorms which makes it good enough for the convenience. Outside of the meal plans, there are plenty of good restaurants and food trucks around the area and throughout Philadelphia. Whether you want good burgers, pizza, cheesesteaks, deli, Chinese, Halal, or fish tacos, there's something out there for you if you're fine with opening up your wallet.",
            "There are about seven or eight different dorms to choose from. Some are classic two-to-a-room kind of dorms, while others might have three or four in a suite-style room. Each has their own flavor, and there are enough dorms to give students a real choice in how much privacy or social interaction they want. The only notable downside in all of the dorms is that they are all a slightly long walk to the dining center (ten to twelve minutes), but they are very close to the campus market with some other food choices relatively close by as well.",
            "Drexel runs on a quarterly semester system. During freshman and senior years, it's effectively a trisemester system since the summer term is just a long break, but if you choose to do a co-op, sophomores and juniors work through summer with either more courses or their co-op work. The quick pace of the school also makes the courses faster and denser than some other colleges. It's not uncommon to see all of your project deadlines and exams on the same day or week.",
            "Don't slack off after the first week or so. The work picks up pace fast with midterms taking place as quick as the fourth or fifth week. Make connections with your professors and go to some of your major's meet-and-greets. There are a lot of different courses to choose from, so it's nice to get to see which professors you like and what courses might be useful or interesting to you.",
            "Drexel University is a great school for anyone looking to earn a head start in real world experience and building connections for a career. The co-op plans provide the perfect opportunity to learn the ins-and-outs of what's in store after college and is also good for anyone who isn't sure of what they want to be and wants to test out some work both in and out of the country. The work is hard and fast, but it pays--mostly literally."

A group tour might be ok if you want to see the campus, but not if you want to try to get to know the campus. Plus, a student will be able to give you a more personal insight into their experiences. With all of that in mind, be aware that the way Drexel operates is in terms or a quarter system. The average college has two semesters of around 14 or 16 weeks and a summer break. Drexel's freshman year consists of three 10 week terms equal to that of a semester and summer term off. The credits you earn on the quarter system are sometimes looked as unequal to those on a semester system by other colleges, so if you ever want to transfer it might be very difficult to do. The workload is very intense being 10 weeks as opposed to 16. Also, Drexel starts and ends later than most colleges. Drexel begins Fall term near the end of September, and Spring term ends around the second week of June, much like most high schools. Good luck on your searching!, 2340=Right now, I am on summer vacation. I cannot wait to go back to Drexel in September. Drexel's campus is filled with fun clubs, organizations, and there's always something to do. If you tire of being on campus, the heart and soul of Philadelphia, Center City, is a short, (free) shuttle ride away., 136741=File FAFSA in January, and you will automatically get $1000 in aid from Drexel., 591407=The top floor of our main buildings has this one room that surely hasn't been touched since 1980. There's all this old tech stuff forgotten up there, which is cool to see. I always want to explore that floor more, I have a feeling there's alot more history to be found., 379117=Not so much on campus but Philadelphia has the Mummer's parade every New Year's and has a great Welcome America for fourth of July., 821129=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 747539=If you're up for the challenge, the opportunities are here at Drexel. If your interested in research, check out the STAR program for incoming freshmen. It's a paid summer internship with housing. For anyone considering attending Drexel, I would contact the department you would be considering for your major. I set up an appointment with the Electrical Engineering department when I went on the campus tour. I met with a professor and an adviser, they were great. They explained how the program worked, spoke about Drexel in general and answered all the questions my parents and I had . They gave us contact information that we used later for followup questions via email and telephone. Checkout the COOP program,COOP is what makes Drexel different. Freshman year started in 9/2012, all freshman are required to take classes to prepare for COOP. In 12/2013 I interviewed with 4 companies, got job offers from 3 and just started(3/31/14) a 6 month full-time position with SAP Solutions (the 4th largest software company in the world). It's an unbelievable opportunity. Even more unbelievable is that I get paid (I think alot), they offered me benefits, health insurance, 401K. I'm excited to learn and contribute. The other tip is something I heard from student at every school I looked at. GET INVOLVED and do it right away... club, sports, Greek life, work study job, student government, newspaper, pep band, anything.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Hard-working, self-motivated, involved, those who like a challenge, leaders, those who like the city, and those who want to learn the most they can so they can go out in the working world and be successful. Tips for prospective students In high school, work hard and get involved. Drexel University is looking for students with good grades and those that take leadership roles. If you get accepted into Drexel, I suggest to take advantage of the 5 year program, which gives you the most working experience. If you are stressed out about the price of the school and you live within commuting distance, don't be afraid to commute. I am a commuter and I feel that I still get the college experience while saving a lot of money. Bang for the buck The reason I give Drexel five stars in this category is that it offers the Co-Op program. It's an opportunity anyone should took take advantage of. It enables you to get yourself into the working world and helps you to boost your resume. Students can work with top companies in different parts of the world as well as here in the U.S. Am enjoying being here",
