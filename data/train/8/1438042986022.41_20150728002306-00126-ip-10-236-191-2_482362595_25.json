    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6920=Below, a brief description will be given on where pixel data output from the CMOS image sensing array 22 is stored in the SDRAM 38, and how the microprocessor (i.e. implementing a decode algorithm) 36 accesses such stored pixel data bytes. FIG. 9F represents the memory space of the SDRAM 38. A reserved memory space of 1.3 MB is used to store the output of the CMOS image sensing array 22. This memory space is a 1:1 mapping of the pixel data from the CMOS image sensing array 22. Each byte represents a pixel in the image sensing array 22. Memory space is a mirror image of the pixel data from the image sensing array 22. Thus, when the decode program (36) accesses the memory, it is as if it is accessing the raw pixel image of the image sensing array 22. No time code is needed to track the data since the modes of operation of the bar code reader guarantee that the microprocessor 36 is always accessing the up-to-date data, and the pixel data sets are a true representation of the last optical exposure. To prevent data corruption, i.e. new data coming in while old data are still being processed, the reserved space is protected by disabling further DMA access once a whole frame of pixel data is written into memory. The DMA module is re-enabled until either the microprocessor 36 has finished going through its memory, or a timeout has occurred.}",
