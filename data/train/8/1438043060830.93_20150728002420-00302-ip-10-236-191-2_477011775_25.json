    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Many modifications and variations of the present invention will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the above teachings. It is therefore understood that the scope of the invention is not to be limited by the foregoing description, but rather is to be defined by the claims appended hereto. Bituminous compositions of the present invention were also produced on a manufacturing scale in parallel flow drum plants in a second field project the Republic of South Africa, where many new asphalt paving technologies have been developed. In the second full-scale construction job, solvent-free bitumen emulsions were prepared using 80/100 bitumen and emulsifiers consisting of blends of polyalkylenepolyamine condensate of modified and unmodified fatty acids and one or more tallow polyalkylenepolyamines. Percentages of the polyalkylenepolyamine condensate of modified and unmodified fatty acids ranged from 0-0.30% and percentages of the tallow polyalkylenepolyamines ranged from 0-0.30%, both by weight of the emulsion. The emulsifier was dissolved in warm water and treated with hydrochloric acid solution to lower the pH to 2.0. The aqueous solution of emulsifier(s) in water (called the \u201csoap solution\u201d) was heated to 55\ufffd C. and added to an Atomix-type colloid mills. Aggregate was a 19-mm nominal basalt. The P-200 content in the aggregate was roughly 7.0%. Emulsion was produced at 68% bitumen residue. Sufficient emulsion was pumped into the drum mixer to yield a bituminous composition having",
