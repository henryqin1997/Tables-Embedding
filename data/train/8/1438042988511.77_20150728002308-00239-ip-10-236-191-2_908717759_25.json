THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE. I love my friends, but if they're using words I don't know, it's obscure drug slang or something they learned off of urban dictionary., 87810=yes an excellent education my dream is attending this campus upon my 2012 graduation}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students who like a sense of community and belonging will definitely profit from the college system. Tips for prospective students Make sure you remember to maintain balance in your life. Most people here are selected not only because of their amazing academic abilities but also because they have strong experiences outside of the classroom. Bang for the buck Rice is definitely cheaper than just about every private school. It's also worth going here over larger public schools. The personal attention from everyone, including the university president who responds quickly to emails you send him make you feel much more like an important person. Make sure to visit, especially for Owl Days if you're admitted. Am enjoying being here Rice deeply cares about your standard of living. The food is great, our new servery has fresh made crepes for lunch and dessert during the week. The dorms are beautiful, as a freshman I have a double with our own bathroom which is cleaned once a week. Everything here is set up to be responsive to the students, especially our awesome college system. Am learning a lot",
