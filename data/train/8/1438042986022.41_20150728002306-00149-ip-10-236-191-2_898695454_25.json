            "Any student planning to major in art, business, philosophy, and nutrition. NYU has highly ranked programs in these fields.",
            "NYU isn't for everyone. If you are expecting a green campus with grass and trees like you see in all the movies, you're coming to the wrong place. Also, don't be afraid to apply. A lot of students who attend NYU never thought that they would be accepted in a million years. If you want to come, you should definitely apply, because you really never know what going to happen.",
            "NYU isn't a cheap school, and its financial aid is not highly regarded. However, it is one of the top universities in the nation. You need to think of the money you spend to attend NYU as an investment. You are going to have to pay a great deal of money, but in the long run, it may be worth it. Still, there are other universities that are ranked higher and give better financial aid, which is definitely something to think about.",
            "NYU is a very enjoyable place. There is an abundance of work that needs to be done for your classes, but there is still plenty of time to enjoy yourself. The university has a variety of activities such as sports teams and clubs. NYU's location is ideal because it is right in Manhattan, which allows for students to take full advantage of all the city has to offer, from its restaurants, museums, theaters, and sports teams.",
            "NYU is a very large university, with about 20,000 undergraduate students. Although there are a great deal of students, NYU manages to keep many of its classes relatively small, which is conducive to learning. The university stresses a solid liberal arts foundation, so you learn way more then just your major, regardless of what school you are in."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{346005=Don't discount it. Seriously. I wasn't very enthusiastic before I came to NYU, even though I had accepted a few months ago. I wasn't even enthusiastic in August, the few weeks before I came to New York. I was terrified and starting to wonder if I'd made the right decision for me. That all changed the first week. I made friends, I met super interesting and creative people, I explored the city, and I was energized. There's nothing like being in New York City with amazing people in your college years. You have the whole world ahead of you, and the city isn't as scary as it seems (coming from someone whose hometown has 8000 people)., 1031362=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 13972=Academically speaking, New York University is somewhat of a hodgepodge in quality between its different schools, so make sure you apply to the right one with the right credentials. Among its more renowned branches include: The Tisch School of the Arts: Founded and supported by the late Laurence Tisch (who, by the way, graduated from what is now Stern) and his family, the Tisch School is known as the #1 film school in the U.S. That said, If you're applying here, make sure you've got artistic chops. You will need a strong portfolio that should blow people away with its creativity and uniqueness, and know that you are competing against the best amateur film makers and artists around the globe. On the bright side, standardized scores and figures aren't emphasized, so a low GPA and SAT aren't that hazardous. Known graduates include Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone, and even Angelina Jolie. Left-handedness is preferred. The Stern School of Business: Known for producing investment bankers that go on to work for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc, the Stern school is filled with people with great mathematical skills with good GPA's and high SAT scores. Aim for a > 3.6 GPA, > 2100 SAT and > 720 on SAT II's. Known graduates include: John Paulson, Robert Soros, Alan Greenspan. NYU's College of Arts & Sciences is a bit trickier than the other two schools, but its strong points include the Courant Department of Mathematics (#1 in applied math, USNWR), Philosophy and Economics. You can study anything here and the requirements are significantly lower than the previously mentioned schools. Aim for >3.4 GPA, >1900 SAT, >650 SAT II's. Gallatin is the school where you can create your own major. You have access to every course at NYU, so you can mix and match things around and end up as a specialist in Indian Agriculture. While the atmosphere here is extremely liberal, I would advise against applying to this school unless you are very independent. Keep in mind, if you wanted to major in Finance or a something in NYU's specialized schools (Tisch & Stern), you would have to do an internal transfer. Requirements are about the same as CAS Polytechnic is the new engineering branch for NYU. Since the school has just been incorporated in to the system, I expect that its requirements would be a little lower than CAS. There you go, a whirlwind tour of NYU's departments. Good luck on your application., 778748=I believe theres about 1000 clubs to choose from, you'll find something!, 244778=Not an unusual tradition, but the 2011 welcome week dance was Lady Gaga themed - called the Monster Ball. People went all out for this dance - some friends and I actually made our dresses out of duct tape!, 754581=Types of students that don't want the typical college experience of going to sports games and everyone in NYU attire. it's great for hipsters, people who march to their own drum, girls who are independent and like to dress up for class, and definitely international students., 538159=During May, there is what is called NYU Strawberry Festival. Basically, it is a celebration of springtime. Many free things are handed out, there is music, and you can see the very long strawberry cake that they have for you taste., 342810=It varies from hall to hall. Weinstein has the only Chick-Fil-A in the city (as of 2014 anyway). There's also a Subway and Jamba Juice in Weinstein. There's also an on-campus Starbucks that accepts Dining Dollars (a component of the NYU meal plan that all freshmen are required to sign up for). Palladium has an awesome all-you-can-eat Sunday brunch with a chocolate fountain, a bagel bar (bagels, smoked salmon, a few types of cream cheese, and scallions), fruit bowls, omelettes, and of course, cereal, eggs, and tater tots. Third North is supposed to be the worst dining hall, but I think we have it pretty good here if people say that. I always see a lot of people at Third North, and I personally like it. The pizza is the best of NYU (in my opinion), and their breakfast wraps are amazing. They also have incredibly addicting chocolate chip cookies. I swear, you can't stop at one. You have to have at least two cookies., 337289=There's a public safety bus that will take you from any NYU location to another from 12:00-7:00AM (I think those are the hours, I forget when the morning ones end). It's also very safe around campus though. There are scattered police on the streets. There are also other students. In general, Greenwich Village (where NYU is located) is a nice area of NYC. Just don't be stupid and you'll be fine. I usually walk back from the library with friends anyway because I don't like walking alone., 705191=Depends on how much tuition is for you, but the teachers here will make it worth your while. The only slight negative effect is that NYU has plans to expand their campus by 2031, and there's a lot of money being diverted to renovations and other things, all which take away from the scholarships that NYU offers. Look for other scholarships at Cappex!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students I transitioned easily, but prior to my arrival, I was told that it was easy to feel isolated at NYU\u2014that it was necessary to put yourself out there and to actively make friendships. For those who do not find that fact daunting, NYU will probably be a great place for you. However, even if you are more reserved, there are plenty of opportunities to meet people (orientation, extra-curricular activities, residence halls, classes) and there truly is a niche for everyone. As long as you are open to new relationships (friends, professors, etc.), perspectives, and environments, you will most likely thrive at NYU. Living in one of the world\u2019s greatest cities is not without its temptations, so make sure you can keep a realistic balance between the social and academic aspects of college. NYU is perfect for those who want an exciting/non-traditional college experience, who don\u2019t mind being obstructed from class because Robert Pattinson is filming, who love bustling cities and cultural experiences, who are open-minded and independent, who want to carve out their own opportunities, who revel in the fact that NYU\u2019s football team is undefeated and the mascot is a violet/the library card catalog, who want to explore, grow, and challenge themselves, in addition to those who are looking to have the time of their lives.
