Mr. Golombek advises that while debt repayment is important, you shouldn't ignore your long term savings goal either. Budgeting Key to Making Retirement Savings Contributions \"While it's positive that so many eligible Canadians plan to contribute towards their retirement this year, we know from previous years that only 26 per cent of eligible tax filers actually made a contribution to their RRSP",
