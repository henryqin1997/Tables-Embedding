    "textAfterTable": "Configuring the LECS Database The LECS database contains LANE configuration information, including ELAN name-to-LES/BUS ATM address mappings, LEC address-to-ELAN name mappings, and the name of the default ELAN, if specified. You must configure at least one LECS database in the LANE network. When configuring the LECS database, remember the following guidelines: You can configure redundant LECSs. Redundant LECSs should be configured on different devices in the LANE network. If you configure more than one LECS, make sure that all databases with the same name are identical. You can specify one default ELAN in the database. The LECS assigns any client that does not request a specific ELAN to the default ELAN. ELANs are either restricted or unrestricted. The LECS assigns a client to an unrestricted ELAN if the client specifies that particular ELAN in its configuration. However, the LECS only assigns a client to a restricted ELAN if the client is specified in the LECS's database as belonging to that ELAN. The default ELAN should have unrestricted membership. If you are configuring fault tolerance, you can have any number of servers per ELAN. Priority is determined by entry order; the first entry has the highest priority unless you override",
