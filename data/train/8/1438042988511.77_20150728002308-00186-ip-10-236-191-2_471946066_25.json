As an example, the harvester may be invoked as follows: harvester -i eth0 -c 1000 -enc 10.5.63.6:333, 112296=As an example, the harvester reads packets off the network when invoked as follows: harvester -i eth0 -c 1000 -dump qs.dmp, 140151=Using the Policy Generation Wizard, a user specifies a network security policy in terms of the network services provided by certain hosts to other hosts in the network. When such policy is processed, the wizard generates a formal and more detailed description of the network security policy using the policy language. The policy language specification may then be used to analyze network traffic using the policy monitor tool. The results of this analysis can be studied using the query tool. An exemplary policy language is taught in A Declarative Language for Specifying a Security Policy, patent application Ser. No. 09/479,781 filed on Jan. 7, 2000., 312177=The preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a technique for a policy engine internally to organize policy rules in order to effect an efficient evaluation of protocol events at runtime. Evaluation of a protocol event entails selecting one or more applicable policy rules using an evaluation algorithm. The preferred evaluation algorithm is described on pages 75 through 77 in A Declarative Language for Specifying a Security Policy, patent application Ser. No. 09/479,781 filed on Jan. 7, 2000. An excerpt describing the preferred evaluation algorithm is provided below in Table S., 112862=In this example, 1000 packets are read off the network interface labeled \u2018eth0\u2019, converted to event data suitable for policy monitor 100, and stored in the file \u2018qs.dme\u2019., 41147=This application is a Continuation-In-Part to U.S. Ser.

No. 60/212,126 filed Jun. 16, 2000., 113404=In this example, 1000 packets are read off the network interface labeled \u2018eth0\u2019, converted to event data suitable for policy monitor 100, and transmitted in a TCP network stream to port 333 on the machine with IP address 10.5.63.6. This machine and TCP port may be configured so that the policy monitor 100 reads the data and processes it., 112460=In this example, 1000 packets are read from a network interface labeled \u2018eth0\u2019 and stored in file \u2018qs.dmp.\u2019, 54010=The policy definition language is described in A Declarative Language for Specifying A Security, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/479,781, (Jan. 7, 2000). The policy definition language is discussed herein to the extent necessary to explain such language to those skilled in the art in connection with the invention and the monitoring system disclosed herein. The declarative language system comprises a language as a tool for expressing network security policy in a formalized way. It allows the specification of security policy across a wide variety of networking layers and protocols. Using the language, a security administrator assigns a disposition to each and every network event that can occur in a data communications network. The event's disposition determines whether the event is allowed, i.e. conforms to the specified policy or disallowed and what action, if any, should be taken by a system monitor in response to that event. Possible actions include, for example, logging the information into a database, notifying a human operator, and disrupting the offending network traffic. Further details of the policy definition language can be found in the patent application cited herein above.}",
