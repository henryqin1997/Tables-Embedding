    "textAfterTable": "Seattle Pacific University is a small school, but the educational quality is wonderful. The professors teach every class themselves, and they are all always ready to meet and talk about your education. Furthermore, the professors themselves are actively engaged in teaching the students, and they love us just as much as we love them. The educational programs available are excellent as well, ranging from one of the top pre-med programs in the nation to an astounding Theology school. Personally, as a School of Theology major, I have learned so much about Christian History and Ministerial Teaching that I never knew about. Even better, this knowledge will help me in my own career plans, and isn't just about memorizing facts for the test.
