She was adopted from Sellers Baptist Home and Adoption Center (which is no longer there) (their records are kept in Monroe, Louisiana at the La. aptist Children's Home). I do know that Antoinette was adopted by a couple who had three years earlier adopted a son. The adoptive father was a salesman with a greeting card company and the mother had stopped her secretarial job with the adoption on the son. I have longed for 27 years to once again hug, kiss and tell Antoinette that I love her and always have. If my love alone could have allowed me to keep my daughter I would have. My family has a history of cancer, heart diease and diabetics. I lost my mother and father at young ages (mother was 49 and father was 68) due to cancer and I would love to at least allow her to know the health history of the family if she does not allow me contact with her.

I was discharged Sept. 20th. I was surrendered september 26th by my birth mother to the Orange County Dept. of Social Services. My parents were not married. My mom was 22. 5'5\" green ey s,brown hair, and medium olive complexion. She was of Protestant faith, college graduate, German and Scottish descent. She may have worked in a library at one time. She liked puzzels, played piano, and was an avid reader. At age three she had rheumatic fe er. My birth father was 24. He was 6 ft talland weighed 175 pounds. He had black hair, blue eyes, fair complexion and was of German descent. He wears glasses. He was working his way through school. He had been in military service. He enjoyed sports cars, unting and fishing. Apparently my parents had known eachother from early childhood and decided together they were not prepared to have a child yet.

I would like edical histories a little more current than thirty two years old., 209318=Comments: I am looking for any member of my birth family.I have no animosity or hard feelings toward either of my birth parents.I would love to be able to say thank you for doing the right thing by giving me to a wonderful family when they felt that they couldn't t ke care of me.I have a great family with two brothers and one sister who are very dear to me.We all look so much alike that you really could never tell that I was the one that was adopted.I used to think that they were actually lying to me as a cruel joke because I look so much like everybody in my family. Through all of my searching this is what I have been able to find so far.I am still researching the best that I can.I know that Catholic Social Services of Wayne County Michigan and Macomb County Probate Court Family Division, also of Michigan handled the adoption.I was told that my birth mom has one son from her previous marriage.I think he was about 3 or 4 years old and his birthday is in February.She was described to me as having light brown/blonde hai and brown eyes. She was 5'2 and slender.Her mother was born in the Ukraine and moved to Nova Scotia before moving to the USA.She is of Polish/Ukrainian decent.My birthmother's father is a mixture of Nationality's,Portuguese being one of them.My birthfath r,I was told through The \"Non-Identifying Information\" was also 23 at the time.He was described as being 5\"7 black hair and blue eyes.He is 100% Polish and was in the military at one point.I have also learned that he knew my birth mom was pregnant but cho e not to even establish paternity.I would love to meet anyone one that I may be related to.You know, to see whom I take after, medical history, etc. Through the Non-Identifying Information I was told that my birth mom and I have a lot of similarities.I wa told that she \"talks in a most rapid manner\" Well,if you knew me you could definitely say the same,she was a Medical Secretary,I went to Medical School.I learned this after I was already in school.Would you say that this may be Hereditary or environmenta ???I have been looking for years with no luck.I'm sure most other people that have been adopted have all of the same questions that I do like,does there family now know about me do I have any other half brothers or sisters? Will they say NO if I finally f nd them and would like to meet them.Are they still alive, etc.If you think you can shed some new light on this or have another avenue that I might be able to try please let me know. At any time please feel free to e-mail me at SpenceMotorHead@Juno.Com Thanks and I hope every ending is a happy one.
