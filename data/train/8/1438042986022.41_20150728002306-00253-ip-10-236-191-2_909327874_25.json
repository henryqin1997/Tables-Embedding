            "It is perfect for someone who is looking for a not to big/not to small school. Tech is known for its engineering program, and now also the nursing program.",
            "Tour the campus and talk to students!",
            "I had looked at many other schools, and in my particular area I am in a higher rated department, paying way less than average.",
            "The campus is beautiful and for the most part everyone is very friendly and inviting. There are many activities on campus, numerous clubs, and a great greek life program. As long as you bring a positive attitude, you will quickly assimilate into college life at Tech.",
            "The general courses are wonderful and challenging. Speaking from experience TTU's classes are on par with any other college, if not more challenging than some more expensive, larger colleges. They offer just the right amount of personalization, because the classes are not tiny but also not all huge lectures."

Fall semester of 2012, Deirks Bentley came and we got two free tickets., 191919=Cafeteria is versatile... but that's not always good. The only good food places close on Friday at 5:30 and open on Monday mornings around 10. Starbucks is really quick., 320415=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 7206=I enjoy the small town feel of Tech. It's safe and cops are always patrolling so I don't have to be as nervous about walking over to the library at night. Also the campus is small so if I am running late for that 8 o'clock class I can get there in five minutes.}",
