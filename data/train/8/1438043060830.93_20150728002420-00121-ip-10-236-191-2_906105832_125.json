I know that the French classes focus more on the grammar of the language than they do vocabulary, so it goes to show how you get a different sort of emphasis in some of the more traditional academics such as foreign language., 772417=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 298835=FSCJ is amazingly cheap, 4 classes this semester ended up being $1234.56, which was cheap and amusingly consecutive. Your education will be good, but that money is pretty much only going to pay for the faculty. Do not expect a shining campus or well-trained staff members. If you are looking to have the full college experience, look somewhere else. If you just want a degree and to enjoy your teachers, you have come to the right place., 677777=I love being a student here at Fscj. This is my second semester. I can't wait to accomplish my goals and graduate in 2017 as a registered nurse., 143690=I don't have any I start class May 14, 2012., 464842=Academic rigor is a little bit of an overstatement. You can learn here, and learn a lot, even if you are a very smart cookie. Getting an A often takes work, but as long as you turn everything in, you'll probably pass a lot of the classes, especially in English. Seems like people pass ENC1101 without knowing anything about MLA.}",

Students looking for small class sizes and a high school feel. Students looking for a smaller, easier to navigate college. Students looking for friendly, accepting peers and understanding faculty. Students who want to test out the waters and find their major. Tips for prospective students This is a great school for first-time college students.
