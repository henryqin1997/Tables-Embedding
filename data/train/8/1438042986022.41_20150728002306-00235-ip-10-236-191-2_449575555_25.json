The difference between the solid red and solid blue lines represents the stock effects of the LSAP program on the yield curve. From this picture, we can see that the effects were statistically significant over nearly the entire term structure and were largest--with a point estimate of about 50 basis points--in the 10- to 15-year sector. The reason that the biggest effects occur in this region is a combination of the relatively large coefficients on old bonds and the relatively large amount of purchases (as a fraction of outstandings) within this sector., 185688=Gagnon, J.; Raskin, M.; Remache, J,; and Sack, B., 2010. \"Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?\" Mimeo, March., 96846=Notes: Volume data come from Bloomberg, and fails-to-deliver data come from the FR 2004 reports.

Although policymakers had floated the possibility of Treasury purchases prior to this announcement, market participants did not appear to place high odds on the decision being taken, and the announcement generally came as a surprise.4 The first operation under the Treasury LSAP program was conducted on March 25. Purchases continued at a pace of about $10 billion per week over the subsequent five months. On August 12, 2009 the Committee announced that it would purchase the full $300 billion (eliminating the ambiguity of the \"up to\" language) and that it would wind down the program in October. After this announcement, the pace of purchases gradually slowed to minimize any potential disruption that might have resulted from a sudden closing of the program., 184257=Bernanke, B.

O., 1994. \"Estimating and Interpreting Forward Rates: Sweden 1992-4,\" NBER Working Paper 4871., 16461=The logistics of the purchase operations were as follows. Every-other Wednesday, the Desk announced the broad maturity sectors in which it would be buying over the subsequent two weeks and the days on which it would be conducting these operations. Auctions took place from Monday of the first week through Friday of the second week and typically settled on the following day.5 At 10:15 on the morning of each auction, the Desk published a list of CUSIPs that were eligible for purchase, which generally included nearly all securities in the targeted sector,6 and began accepting propositions. At 11:00 AM, the auction closed. The Desk then determined which securities to buy from among the submitted bids based on a confidential algorithm, and it published the auction results within a few minutes of the auction close. Market participants were not aware in advance of the total amount to be purchased or of the distribution of purchases across CUSIPs., 185972=Greenwood, R. and Vayanos, D., 2010. \"Price Pressure in the Government Bond Market.\" American Economic Review 100(2): 585-90., 186147=Gurkyanak, R. and Wright, J., 2010. \"Macroeconomics and the Term Structure.\" Mimeo, April., 91268=Finally, we caution that the environment that produced our data involved exceptional conditions in the Treasury market that could make extrapolation of these results to other situations problematic. We provided some evidence that our main flow-effect results did not depend greatly on the liquidity environment over the course of 2009. But we are not able to conduct a similar test for stock effects, and we still cannot rule out that other special circumstances during that period might have helped to drive the results--for example, Gurkaynak and Wright (2010) conjecture that increased risk aversion during the financial crisis could have reduced arbitrage activity and led to greater market segmentation. Testing how stock and flow effects differ across risk and liquidity regimes is an interesting area for future research and could further illuminate the factors that influence pricing and functioning in the Treasury market., 188536=Vayanos, D. and Vila, J-L., 2009. \"A Preferred-Habitat Model of the Term Structure of Interest Rates.\" NBER Working Paper 15487., 185075=Engen, Eric, and R. Glenn Hubbard. 2005. \"Federal Government Debt and Interest Rates.\" In Gertler and Rogoff (eds.), NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2004. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press., 65602=In the remainder of this section, we focus only on securities with less than 15 years to maturity, given that that is where most purchases occurred and where most of the statistical significance seems to be. Within this sub-sample, Table 4 splits the data into purchases that occurred during the first half of the LSAP program (March 25 - July 6) and those that occurred during the second half (July 7 - October 29). As noted earlier, liquidity in the Treasury market was substantially better during the second half of the sample. Thus, if the price responses to LSAP purchases were due to impediments to market clearing and price discovery resulting from poor market functioning, we would expect the results to be substantially weaker in the second sub-sample. The first two columns of the table show that there is no evidence of this, at least among securities that were eligible for purchase--the coefficients are nearly identical for the two sub-periods and are very close to the pooled results reported in the first column of Table 3. However, the story is more complicated for the securities that were ineligible for purchase. For those securities, the coefficients on all of the substitute purchases are negative in the first half of the sample and positive in the second half. (Recall that they were insignificant when the two sub-samples were pooled.) During the second half of the sample, the coefficients on near- and mid-substitute purchases are close to those for the eligible sample, as we would expect given that there was generally little qualitative difference between eligible and not-eligible securities. Thus, the first half of the sample for the not-eligible securities is the puzzling piece of the data. A possible explanation is that dealers anticipated being able to sell more to the Fed than they actually were able to sell and thus sold securities (including securities that had not been eligible) after LSAP operations in order to maintain a portfolio target. Such an effect would likely have dissipated by the second half of the sample, as participants learned the pattern of the Desk's operations., 187460=Modigliani, F. and Sutch, R., 1966. \"Innovations in Interest Rate Policy.\" American Economic Review 56(1): 178-197., 183819=Andres, J.; Lopez-Salido, J. D.; and Nelson, E., 2004. \"Tobin's Imperfect Asset Substitution in Optimizing General Equilibrium.\" Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking 36(4): 665-90., 188217=Tarhan, V., 1995. \"Does the Federal Reserve Affect Asset Prices?\" Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 19: 1199-222., 19050=Figure 2 shows the behavior of Treasury yields over the period of the program. After the initial announcement, medium- to long-dated yields fell by as much as 50 basis points, with yields in the 5- to 10-year sector declining the most. However, the decline was short-lived--by early May most yields had returned to their pre-announcement levels, and they shot up further in June as the economic outlook improved, policy uncertainty increased, and investors shed duration following a rise in mortgage rates. Although some of these increases reversed by October, most yields were still 20 to 40 basis points higher at the end of the program than they were before it started, and indeed they increased by the greatest amount in precisely the 5- to 10-year portion of the term structure where purchases were concentrated. These increases led some observers (e.g., Thornton, 2009) to conclude that the LSAPs had been ineffective in reducing interest rates. Of course, as we demonstrate below, such reasoning ignores other factors that may have been influencing yields over this period, including the possibility that the distribution of purchases itself was responding endogenously to relative changes in Treasury prices., 187052=Krishnamurthy, A. and Vissing-Jorgensen, A., 2007. \"The Demand for Treasury Debt.\" NBER Working Paper 12881., 175070=Notes: The dependent variable is the cumulative percentage price change from March 17 to October 30, 2009.

E., 1969. \"'Operation Twist' and the Movement of Interest Rates and Related Economic Time Series.\" International Economic Review 10(3): 260-5., 75353=Our identification relies on two ideas. First, preferred-habitat or portfolio-balance effects are large enough such that reducing the available supply of a particular security should have greater effects on that security (and its near substitutes) than on securities that are of much different maturities. Second, we note that the expectation effects just mentioned only matter prior to the conclusion of the program. In other words, while there may be temporary price fluctuations reflecting changing expectations of future purchases, these expectations become irrelevant once the total actual amounts and distribution of purchases is revealed. Thus, all else equal, the difference in price changes across two securities between the time the program was announced and the time it was concluded should depend only on the relative amount of each security that was actually purchased over the life of the program. With this in mind, our regressions for the stock effects use the cross section of total price changes for all nominal Treasury coupon securities between March 17 and October 30, 2009. Some previous studies of LSAPs, such as Gagnon et al. (2010), have tried to identify their effects by looking at the reaction of prices within specific event windows around important announcements. The difficulty with this approach (apart from the danger of mis-specifying the appropriate windows) is that it relies solely on changes in expectations of purchases that occur within the windows--if market participants had some expectation of purchases prior to the windows, or if they changed their expectations any time outside the windows, or if they waited until purchases actually occurred to fully impound their effects, the event study will not capture the true effects of the program. Instead, our approach relies solely on cross-sectional variation for identification and is therefore less susceptible to this sort of timing critique., 187921=Stroebel, J. C. and J. B. Taylor, 2009. \"Estimated Impact of the Fed's Mortgage-Backed Securities Purchase Program.\" NBER Working Paper 15626., 186480=Hamilton, J. and Wu, J., 2010. \"The Effectiveness of Alternative Monetary Policy Tools in a Zero Lower Bound Environment.\" Mimeo, August., 82576== {1, ..., 4} indexes the security type, and is the remaining maturity as of March 17. Because we are using a cross section, we exclude securities that matured or were issued while the program was in progress, leaving us with 148 observations., 186259=Hakim, S. R. and Rashidian, M., 2000. \"Testing for Segmentation in the Term Structure: Operation Twist Revisited.\" Quarterly Journal of Business and Economics 39(1): 3-21., 48395=Our data consist of daily observations on the universe of outstanding nominal Treasury coupon securities from March 25 through October 30, 2009. To simplify the analysis, we exclude TIPS and securities with remaining maturities of less than 90 days, leaving us with an unbalanced panel of 204 CUSIPs (including 44 securities that were never purchased under the LSAP program). Our dependent variables are percentage price changes in each of these securities (measured at end-of-day). Our independent variables are constructed from the security-level amounts purchased and total outstanding amounts.16, 170753=Notes: The dependent variable is the total amount of each security purchased under the LSAP program, normalized by the total amount of Treasuries outstanding with remaining maturities within two years.

S., 2009. \"The Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet.\" Speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond 2009 Credit Markets Symposium, Charlotte, North Carolina, April 3., 4249=There was particular cause for skepticism regarding the program to purchase Treasury securities. The market for U.S. government debt is among the largest and most liquid in the world, and it was not obvious that even such a sizeable intervention--the $300 billion purchased by the Fed constituted about 8 percent of the market at the time--would have significant effects, given the array of other securities that serve as potential substitutes for Treasuries. Indeed, while the MBS and agency-debt LSAP programs were quickly judged successful, with conventional mortgage rates dropping about 1 percentage point after the announcement of these programs and remaining in the range of 5 percent for the duration of the crisis, the effects of the Treasury program were far from obvious. Treasury yields fell notably when the program was announced on March 18, 2009, but they retraced those declines in subsequent weeks. Some observers even speculated that the program could perversely serve to increase yields if the accompanying rise in reserve balances were seen as inflationary or if the Fed were viewed as accommodating fiscal expansion by \"monetizing the debt.\"1, 188686=Yellen, J., 2009. Panel discussion for the Federal Reserve Board/Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking conference on \"Financial Markets and Monetary Policy.\" Washington, DC, June 5., 185285=Federal Reserve, 2008. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 15-16, 2008. Washington, DC. http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20081216.pdf, 187625=Neely, C. J., 2010. \"The Large Scale Asset Purchases Had Large International Effects.\" FRB St. Louis Working Paper 2010-018A., 8242=An additional innovation of our approach is to distinguish between two types of impact that the LSAP program might have had--flow effects and stock effects. \"Flow effects\" are defined as the response of prices to the ongoing purchase operations and could reflect, on top of portfolio rebalancing activity due to the outcome of the purchases, impairments in liquidity and functioning of the Treasury market. Such market imperfections might allow even pre-announced withdraws of supply to have effects on prices when they occur. To estimate flow effects, we model the percentage change in each CUSIP's price on each day that purchase operations occurred as a function of the amount of that CUSIP and the amounts of substitute securities purchased. Meanwhile, \"stock effects\" are defined as persistent changes in price that result from movements along the Treasury demand curve and include the market reaction due to changes in expectations about future withdraws of supply. To estimate stock effects, we model the cumulative change in each CUSIP's price between March 17, 2009 and October 29, 2009 (i.e., the cross section of Treasury returns) as a function of total own and substitute Treasury purchases. Because, over the life of the program, purchased amounts could have responded endogenously to price changes, we instrument LSAP purchases with the purchased securities' characteristics prior to the announcement of the program when estimating stock effects. By removing our estimated stock effects from the actual cross section of Treasury prices as of the end of the LSAP program, we are able to construct a counterfactual yield curve that represents what interest rates might have looked like if the program had never existed., 77339=However, there is an obvious danger of endogeneity in our exercise--if the Fed was deliberately targeting securities that were underpriced, purchases may have been higher among issues whose yields rose the most during the life of the program. To control for this possibility, we use two-stage least squares. In the first stage, we instrument the LSAP purchase amounts of each security using information available before the program was announced. Specifically, our instruments are: remaining maturity and remaining maturity squared; the residuals from a yield curve estimated on March 17 using the Svensson functional form; the average of these Svensson fitting errors for each security's near substitutes; the price of each security on March 17; a dummy variable for whether the security was on the run; and a dummy variable indicating whether the security was an \"old bond,\" meaning an originally 30-year security with less than 15 years remaining until maturity.25 In the second-stage regression, we use instrumented purchases from the first stage as independent variables and the cumulative changes in Treasury prices as the dependent variable. We also include remaining maturity and remaining maturity squared as regressors to account for secular changes in the slope and curvature of the yield curve that were unrelated to the LSAP program, such as could have resulted from macroeconomic conditions and new Treasury issuance., 184615=Cochrane, J. and Piazessi, M., 2005. \"Bond Risk Premia.\" American Economic Review 95(1): 138-60., 187288=Longstaff, F.

L., 2009. \"The Effect of the Fed's Purchase of Lon-Term Treasuries on the Yield Curve,\" FRB St. Louis Economic Synopses (25)., 13942=Although smaller than the MBS LSAP program in dollar volume and smaller than the agency-debt program as a fraction of its respective market, the Treasury program merits special study for several reasons. First, while the agency-debt and MBS programs were primarily focused on reducing mortgage rates and stimulating the housing market, the Treasury program was seen as having the ability to contribute to reductions in the cost of credit across a range of markets. Indeed, there were those on the FOMC who argued for a greater role for the Treasury program, rather than the other two, on precisely these grounds.3 Second, understanding the effects of changes in the supply of Treasury debt available to the public is likely to have broader policy importance. Under normal circumstances, the Fed conducts most of its open-market operations in Treasuries, the Treasury Department may worry about the interest-rate effects of introducing new supply, and foreign central banks conduct sizeable interventions in this market to maintain their reserves. The issue also received renewed attention in mid-2010, when the FOMC announced that it would begin reinvesting the principal payments on its MBS and agency debt portfolios into Treasury securities, potentially taking substantial additional quantities out of the market., 187772=Ross, M., 1966. \"`Operation Twist': A Mistaken Policy?\" Journal of Political Economy 74(2): 195-99.}",
