    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{78076=An alternate to having the remote controller with embedded G-code decoder send channel, date, time and length information to the video cassette recorder/player 70, is to have the remote controller with embedded G-code decoder perform more operations to simplify the interfacing problem with existing video cassette recorder/players. In particular, if the remote controller not only performs the G-code decoding to CDTL, but also keeps track of time via clock 85, then it is possible for the remote controller to send just channel, start record and stop commands to the video cassette recorder/player. The channel, start and stop are usually basic one or two key commands, which means there is no complicated protocol or sentence structure involved. Thus, to communicate with a diverse set of video cassette recorder/player models it is only necessary to have memory within the remote controller, such as ROM 64 of FIG. 4, for storing the protocol for all the models or at least a large subset. The G-code would be entered on the remote controller as before and decoded into channel, date, time and length information, which would be stored in the remote controller. Via clock 85, the time would be checked and when the correct time arrives the remote controller would automatically send out commands to the VCR unit for tuning to the correct channel and for starting and stopping the recording. It is estimated that only two (2) bytes per key for about 15 keys need to be stored for the vocabulary for each video cassette recorder/player model. Thus, to cover 50 models would only require about 30*50=1500 bytes of memory in the remote controller. It would be necessary to position the remote controller properly with respect to the VCR unit so that the infrared signals sent by the remote controller are received by the unit., 231135=The initial set-up programmer 1200 includes a keyboard 1202, a display 1204, an enclosure 1206, and a lid 1208, with hinges 1209 at the top that allow the lid to open to reveal a depression 1210 for holding instant programmers 300 and custom programmers 1100 and two electrical contact pins 1212 as shown in FIG. 46. The initial set-up programmer 1200 includes a modular phone jack 1230 and a serial port 1232 as shown in FIG. 47 for transferring data to and from computers, either directly or over telephone lines., 246903=If the embodiment of FIG. 59 is used, the ROM 1332 installed into the custom controller at manufacture is programmed with the IR codes of many different brands, models and types of home electronic devices. In this case, the computer downloads, through microphone assembly 1334, the addresses of the ROM for all of the necessary IR codes into RAM 1330 instead of downloading the IR codes themselves., 233626=Alternatively, local channel table data can be transferred to the initial set-up programmer 1200 by audio signals carried over telephone lines. Further, local channel tables may be entered into the initial set-up programmer through keyboard 1202 in the same manner used to program this information into either instant programmers 300 or custom programmers 1100., 254926=Two alternative embodiments of the custom controller 1300 are shown in FIGS. 65-70 and FIGS. 71-76. These controllers include control faces that are at angles from the rear face of less than or equal to 45\ufffd, substantially circular bottom faces and rear faces that are larger relative to prior art remote controls., 254201=Another feature of the custom controller is its two control surfaces 1302 and 1304. Auxiliary control surface 1304 is designed to include buttons that will be used most often when the custom controller is in its upright position, such as volume up and down controls. The angle between the rear surface and the auxiliary control surface is less than or equal to 45\ufffd. Keeping the angle less than or equal to 45\ufffd directs at least half of the force needed to press button on the auxiliary control surface downwards into the table or other surface the custom controller is resting on instead of sideways, which would tend to topple the custom controller when it is in the upright position., 232552=FIG. 51 is a schematic that shows circuitry included in the initial set-up programmer 1200. The initial set-up programmer includes a microcontroller (NEC \u03bcPD7530x) 1214, a liquid crystal display 1216, a keypad 1218, static random access memory (static RAM) 1220, computer port 1222 and programming pins 1224. Local channel tables can be transferred from a computer to the initial set-up programmer 1200 and stored in static RAM 1220., 251512=The degree of enlargement of the rear surface 1312 needs to be enough so that the custom controller is stable and resistant to being tipped over when it is put in the upright position shown in FIG. 58. Determining an acceptable size of rear portion is based on several factors. First, it usually desirable for the length and the width of the rear surface to be approximately equal. If the length is significantly greater than the width (as is the case with traditional prior art universal remote controls), the controller can be easily tipped over along the axes that span the width of the rear surface. Next, the proportion of the height of the controller to the length and width of the rear surface cannot be too great. A ratio of the length of the rear face to the height of the controller and of the width of the rear face to the height of the controller of approximately 3 to 1 or less is usually sufficient. However, this ratio depends on the uniformity of the density of the custom controller and thus the center of gravity. If the upper portions of the custom controller (when it is in the upright position) are more dense than the lower portions, the center of gravity will be high and the ratio of the width and length of the rear surface will need to be reduced. On the other hand, if the lower portions are more dense, the center of gravity will be lower and the ratio can be safely increased. One way the center of gravity is lowered in the custom controller is by placing the batteries 1316, which are comparatively very dense, very near the rear surface., 234035=Included in keyboard 1202 are \u201cSEND CLK\u201d, \u201cSEND CH\u201d, \u201cSEND CAB\u201d and \u201cSEND VCR\u201d, which set the clock, download the local channel table, select the protocol for the cable box brand and model and select the protocol for the VCR brand and model, respectively when they are pressed. If the information is successfully transferred to the instant programmer 300 or custom programmer 1100 connected to the initial set-up programmer 1200, display 1204 displays the message \u201cTr OK\u201d, otherwise the message \u201cTr Err\u201d is displayed on display 1204., 227677=FIGS. 43 and 44 are schematics of the circuitry needed to implement alternative embodiments of the custom programmer 1100. The circuit consists of microcomputer 1150, oscillator 1152, liquid crystal display 1154, keypad 1156, five way IR transmitters 1158 and red warning light emitting diode 1160. These components directly correspond to microcomputer 380, oscillator 382, liquid crystal display 384, keypad 386, five way IR transmitters 388 and red warning light emitting diode 332, respectively of instant programmer 300 and perform in the same manner. In both FIGS. 43 and 44, earpiece 1142 generates serial audio signals which are received by microphone 1162., 97816=Suppose the channel date time length (CDTL) 144 data is 5 10 19.00 1.5, which means channel 5, 10th day of the month, 7:00 PM, and 1.5 hours in length, then for the above example the Cp,Dp,Tp,Lp data 148, which are the result of looking up the priorities for channel, date, time and length in priority tables 124, 126, 128 and 130 of FIG. 7, would be 4 9 1 3. Step 150 converts Cp,Dp,Tp,Lp data to binary numbers. The number of binary bits in each conversion is determined by the number of combinations involved. Seven bits for Cp, which can be denoted as C7 C6 C5 C4 C3 C2 C1, would provide for 128 channels. Five bits for Dp, which can be denoted as D5 D4 D3 D2 D1, would provide for 31 days in a month. Six bits for Tp, which can be denoted as T6 T5 T4 T3 T2 T1, would provide for 48 start times on each half hour of a twenty four hour day. Four bits for length, which can be denoted as L4 L3 L2 L1, would provide for a program length of up to 8 hours in half hour steps. Together there are 7+5+6+4=22 bits of information, which correspond to 2**22=4,194,304 combinations., 215574=Another preferred embodiment of the transmission method and apparatus between equipments is shown in FIG. 36, which is a perspective view showing a cable box 372 placed on top of a VCR 370 having an infrared transmitter 1008 behind the front panel 1009 which communicates to the cable box infrared receiver 1010 via reflection from surrounding reflecting surfaces such as walls., 249867=Alternatively, the initial set-up programmer 1200 could be used to perform the IR code programming of the custom controller 1300 instead of using the microphone/telephone interface., 222721=As discussed above, when using the instant programmer 300, the consumer initially performs a set-up sequence, consisting of selecting a protocol for the model/brand of VCR, setting the current real time, selecting a protocol for the model/brand of cable box, and entering a series of channel number assignments. Although the instant programmer 300 makes recording of television programs extremely simple, the initial set-up sequence for the instant programmer 300 is more complex and deters the use of the instant programmer by some consumers. Custom programmer 1100 includes a microphone opening 1140 through which at least one microphone inside the custom programmer 1100 can receive electronically coded audio signals that contain the information necessary for the custom programmer's initial set-up and commands to store this information into the custom programmer 1100., 229823=Another preferred embodiment includes a separate initial set-up programmer 1200 as shown in FIG. 45. The initial set-up programmer 1200 serves the same basic function as the telephonic audio signal programming capability of custom programmer 1100, namely allowing the total set up of the instant programmer 300 or custom programmer 1100 with a minimum of effort on the part of the consumer. Normally, initial set-up programmers 1200 would be maintained by sellers of either the instant programmer 300 or the custom programmer 1100. The initial set-up programmer could be programmed with the local channel tables for the cable systems and the television calendars that publish G-codes in the vicinity of the seller. When a customer purchases an instant programmer 300 or custom programmer 1100, the seller can inquire where the customer lives and which television calendar the customer uses and use the initial set-up programmer 1200 to download the appropriate local channel table for that customer. Further, the initial set-up programmer 1200 can also set the clock, VCR brand and model, and cable box brand and model for the customer's instant programmer 300 or custom programmer 1100., 195715=Suppose the channel, date, time and length (CDTL) 514 data is channel 5, Feb. 10, 1990, 7:00 PM and 1.5 hours in length, then the Cp,Dp,TLp data 532 for the above example would be 4 9 19. The next step is the convert Cp, Dp, TLp to binary numbers and concatenate them into one binary number step 534, resulting in the data word . . . TL2TL1 . . . C2C1 . . . D2D1 536. For the example given above, converting the . . . TL2TL1 . . . C2C1 . . . D2D1 536 word to binary would yield the three binary numbers: . . . 0010011, . . . 0100, . . . 01001. The number of binary bits to use in each conversion is determined by the number of combinations involved. This could vary depending on the implementation; however one preferred embodiment would use eight bits for Cp, denoted as C8 C7 C6 C5 C4 C3 C2 C1, which would provide for 256 channels, five bits for Dp, which can be denoted as D5 D4 D3 D2 D1, would provide for 31 days in a month, and fourteen bits for TLp, denoted as TL14 . . . TL3 TL2 TL1, which would provide for start times spaced every 5 minutes over 24 hours and program lengths in increments of 5 minute lengths for programs up to 3 hours in length and program length in increments of 15 minute lengths for programs from 3 to 8 hours in length. This requires about 288*(36+20)=16,128 combinations, which are provided by the 2**14=16,384 binary combinations. Altogether there are 8+5+14=27 bits of information TL14 . . . TL2TL1C8 . . . C2C1D5 . . . D2D1. For the above example padding each number with zeros and then concatenating them would yield the 27 bit binary number: 000000000100110000010001001., 241461=In the embodiment of FIG. 59, the microprocessor consults a look-up table in RAM 1330 which contains address to ROM 1332, which contains the actual IR codes. The ROM address is retrieved from RAM at the address derived from the pressed button on keyboard 1320. The IR code is then retrieved from ROM at the address retrieved from RAM. This embodiment allows the ROM to be preprogrammed with the IR codes for a large number of home electronic devices. This increases the minimum size of the ROM substantially, but reduces the minimum size of the RAM because ROM addresses are generally shorter than IR codes., 177943=FIG. 22 is a schematic of the circuitry needed to implement the instant programmer 300. The circuity consists of microcomputer 380, oscillator 382, liquid crystal display 384, key pad 386, five way IR transmitters 390 and red warning light emitting diode 332. The microcomputer 380 consists of a CPU, ROM, RAM, I/O ports, timers, counters and clock. The ROM is used for program storage and the RAM is used among other purposes for stack storage of the programs to be recorded. The liquid crystal display 384 is display 350 of FIGS. 15 and 19. The key pad 386 implements all the previously discussed keys. The five way IR transmitters 390 consists of front infrared (IR) diode 340, left IR diode 342, down IR diode 344, two back IR diodes 346 and right IR diode 348. FIG. 23 shows the detailed schematic of the instant programmer 300 circuitry and previously identified elements are identified by the same numbers. The microcomputer can be implemented with a NEC \u03bcPD7530x part, which can interface directly with the display, the keypad, the light emitting diodes and the oscillator. The 25 degree IR diodes can be implemented with NEC 313AC parts and the 5 degree IR diodes can be implement with Litton 2871C IR diodes., 224541=The operator then directs the consumer to press a designated programming key which is, in the case of the preferred embodiment, the CH key located under lid 1114. When the CH key is pressed, the display 1134 with display the message \u201cPHONE1 KEY2\u201d. Pressing the \u201c2\u201d numeric key places the custom programmer into the manual local channel table programming mode that is implemented by instant programmer 300 when CH key 322 is pressed. Pressing the \u201c1\u201d numeric key initiates the remote programming mode. The custom programmer 1100 is then ready to receive an audio signal and display 1134 displays the message \u201cWAIT\u201d., 216533=Another preferred embodiment of the transmission method and apparatus between equipments is shown in FIG. 38, which is a perspective view of a VCR 370 having an infrared transmitter 1022 inside a mouse 1020 coupled via a cable 1018, which is plugged via plug 1017 into receptacle 1016 on the VCR. The mouse 1020 is placed near the cable box infrared receiver 1010. This embodiment is most useful when the cable box is separated from the VCR by walls of a cabinet, for example, that would prevent either direct or reflective infrared transmission., 202335=The next step is the combine groups of bits and convert each group into decimal numbers and concatenate into one decimal number step 542. For example, after reordering according to the bit hierarchy key, the code may be 000000001010010000010001001, which could be grouped as 00000000101001000,0010001001. If these groups of binary bits are converted to decimal as 328,137 and concatenated into one decimal number, then the resulting decimal number is 328137. The last encoding step is the permute decimal number step 546, which permutes the decimal number according to permutation function 544 that is dependent on the date 548 and in particular the month and year and provides a security feature for the codes. After the permute decimal number step 546, the decimal compressed code G8 . . . G2G1 1 550 may, for example, be 238731. These encoded codes are then included in a program guide or calendar as in the compressed code indication 212 of FIG. 8., 126395=The first step 102 is to enter G-code 104. Next the G-code 104 is converted to a 22 bit binary number in step 106. Then the bits are reordered in step 108 according to the bit hierarchy key 120 to obtain the reordered bits 110. Then the bits are grouped together and converted to decimal form in step 112. As this point we obtain Cp,Dp,Tp,Lp data 114, which are the indices to the priority vector tables. For the above example, we would have at this step the vector 4 9 1 3. This Cp,Dp,Tp,Lp data 114 is then used in step 116 to look up channel, date, time, and length in priority vector storage 122. The CDTL 118 for the example above is 5 10 19.00 1.5, which means channel 5, 10th day of the month, 7:00 PM, and 1.5 hours in length., 226967=Alternatively, a live operator could be provided by the local cable company and the initial set-up information downloaded to the custom programmer 1100 by telephone line, through the existing cable of the cable system, or any other transmission means. If local cable companies supply the live operators, the only information they would need to gather from the consumer would be the VCR brand and model and the publication containing compressed codes that the consumer plans on using, because the local cable company would know the model and brand of cable box installed at the consumer's location and the necessary data regarding the local channel designations for that cable system., 238978=Most of the time, the custom controller will be used to control televisions, VCRs, cable boxes, satellite receivers and hi-fi audio equipment. It is noted that both the instant programmer 300 and the custom programmer 1100 already functioned as universal remote controllers with respect to video recorders, cable boxes, televisions and satellite receivers as they can control diverse brands and models of these devices. However, the instant and custom programmers only use their universal remote features to change or select channels on cable boxes, video recorders, televisions and satellite receivers, begin and end recording by video recorders and turning the power on any of these devices on and off. Nonetheless, the schematic of the custom controller will be the same as the schematics of the custom programmer shown in FIGS. 43 and 44 except that the custom controller includes a keypad (see 1156) with more buttons and the size requirements for the ROM and RAM in the microcomputer (see 1150) are greater than in the custom programmer. FIGS. 58 and 59 show block diagram schematics for two alternate embodiments of the custom controller. It is noted these two schematics contain the same basic components, but the utilization and minimum size of the RAMs 1324 and 1330 and ROMs 1326, 1332 are different., 203396=FIG. 28 is a flowchart of the method for decoding a decimal compressed code into channel, date, time and length 560, which is step 414 of FIG. 24. Once the decimal compressed code G8 . . . G2G1 564 is entered in step 562, it is necessary to invert the permutation function of steps 544 and 546 of FIG. 27. The first step is the extract day code step 566, which extracts the day code for the program in the decimal compressed code and passes the day code to step 568, which also receives the current day 574 from the clock 576, which is implemented by microcomputer 380 in FIGS. 22 and 23. The clock 576 also sends the current month and year to the permutation function 570, which is dependent on the month and year. Then step 568 performs the function: if day code is same or greater than current day from clock, then use permutation function for month/year on clock, otherwise use permutation function for next month after the month on the clock and use next year if the month on the clock is December. In other words, since there is provision for preprogramming recording for one month or 31 days ahead, if the day for the program is equal to or greater than the current day of the month, then it refers to a day in the present month; otherwise, if the day for the program is less than the current day of the month, it must refer to a program in the next month. The extract day code step 566, which must be performed before the invert permutation of decimal compressed code step 580, is accomplished by a prior knowledge of how the permute decimal number step 546 of FIG. 27 is performed relative to the day code information., 233068=FIG. 52 is a schematic showing the data transfer connection between a personal computer 1226 and initial set-up programmer 1200. Local channel table data is output from personal computer 1226 through a serial RS-232 port with +12 and \u221212 volt signals. The +12 and \u221212 volt signals are transformed to TTL compatible 0 and 5 volt signals by level shifter 1228 which are input into microcontroller 1214. Level shifter 1228 can be either external or internal to initial set-up programmer 1200., 240365=The custom controller's complete universal remote feature operates as follows. Each button on the keyboard 1320, which is mounted on control surfaces 1302, 1304 of the custom controller, is hard wired with a button code or a memory address, which is generated each time the button is pressed. The microcomputer 1322 receives the code or address generated by the pressed button and, if the button generates a code, consults a look-up table to retrieve an address for the button code. This look up table, as well as the instructions that control the operation of the microprocessor are stored in ROM 1326 and 1332., 183212=FIG. 27 is a flowchart of the method for encoding channel, date, time and length (CDTL) into decimal compressed code 510. This process is done \u201coff-line\u201d and can be implemented on a general purpose computer and is done to obtain the compressed codes 212 that are included in the program guide or calendar of FIG. 8. The first step in the encoding method is the enter channel, date, time and length (CDTL) step 512 wherein for a particular program the channel, date, start time and length CDTL 514 of the program are entered. The next step is the look up assigned channel number step 516, which substitutes an assigned channel number 522 for each channel 518. Often, for example for network broadcast channels, such as channel 2, the assigned channel number is the same; however, for a cable channel such as HBO a channel number is assigned and is looked up in a cable assigned channel table 520, which would essentially be the same as the first two columns of the table of FIG. 29. Next, the look up priority of channel, date and time/length in priority vector tables step 524 performs a look up in priority vector channel (C) table 526, priority vector date (D) table 528 and priority vector time/length (TL) table 530 using the indices of channel, date and time/length, respectively, to produce the vector Cp, Dp, TLp 532. The use of a combined time/length (TL) table to set priorities recognizes that there is a direct relationship between these combinations and the popularity of a program. For example, at 6:30 PM, a short program is more likely to be popular than a 2 hour program, because it may be the dinner hour., 225998=If the initial set-up data is successfully transferred to the custom programmer 1100, the display 1134 of the custom programmer 1100 will display the message \u201cDONE\u201d. If the reception of the initial set-up data is not successful within a predetermined time limit, red warning light emitting diode 1132 will blink to inform the consumer to adjust the position of the telephone earpiece before another down load of the information is attempted. After a waiting period allowing this adjustment, the initial set-up data and commands are re-transmitted over the telephone line. If after a predetermined number of attempts to download the initial set-up information are unsuccessful, the liquid crystal display 1134 displays the message \u201cFAIL\u201d and the operator is again connected to the consumer allowing the operator to speak to the consumer to provide additional assistance in the positioning of the telephone earpiece., 241039=In the embodiment of FIG. 58, the microprocessor retrieves an IR code from RAM 1324 at the address derived from the pressed button. In this embodiment, the minimum size for the ROM is very small as the ROM only needs to store the button code look up table and microprocessor instructions. However, the size of the RAM needs to be large enough to store an IR code for each button on the keyboard., 67269=By contrast, this command could have been \u201ccoded\u201d and entered in a typical G-code sequence as follows: PROG 1138 PROG. To distinguish that the command is a coded G-code, the G-code switch 22 should be turned to the \u201cON\u201d position. Instead of having a switch, a separate key \u201cG\u201d can be used. The G-code programming keystroke sequence would then be: G 1138 PROG., 229013=Alternatively, a dual microphone system (not shown) may be employed to increase reliability, especially when the custom programmer 1100 is to be programmed in an environment with a high level of background noise that could interfere with the transmission of data through the single microphone acoustic means. In this system, one microphone would be placed near the telephone earpiece and the second microphone would be place some distance away from the earpiece in order to pick up background noise. A audio signal cancellation circuit is then used to effectively \u201csubtract\u201d the background noise picked up by the second microphone from the audio data signals combined with the background noise that is picked up from the first microphone resulting in solely clean audio data signals., 219674=FIG. 35 is a block diagram of a system including a satellite receiver 1005 having a G-code decoder, a television 952, a VCR 964, and a cable box 966. The user would use the television remote controller 956 or controls on the satellite receiver 1005 to enter the code that signifies the program to be recorded. When a G-code is entered, the television remote would send the G-code to satellite receiver 1005 with G-code decoder 1004 via infrared transmitter 958. An infrared receiver 1002 on the satellite receiver 1005 would receive the transmission and send the code to the G-code decoder 1004, which would decode the code into CDTL and use this information along with a clock, which would also be embedded in the satellite receiver 1005, to send the proper commands to the VCR 964 and the cable box 966 at the appropriate time so that the selected program will be recorded at the proper time. The transmission from the satellite receiver 1005 would be via infrared transmitters 1006, which can be placed at strategic points on the satellite receiver. The transmission is then received by the VCR 964 via infrared receiver 968 and the cable box 966 via infrared receiver 969. The transmission methods and apparatus of FIGS. 36, 37, 38 and 39 could also be used with the system of FIG. 35 to transmit information from satellite receiver 1005 to VCR 964 and cable box 966., 249469=A decoder (not shown) is included between the microphone assembly 1334 and the microprocessor 1322 that converts the 3000 Hz signals to high electrical signals and converts the 500 Hz signals to low electrical signals that are sent to a serial input into the microprocessor. A clock signal is simultaneously sent to the microprocessor with each high or low signal., 246172=Once this information has been entered into the computer, in block 1354 the computer programs the custom programmer in at least two different ways, depending on whether the embodiment of FIG. 58 or 59 is used. If the embodiment of FIG. 58 is used, the computer downloads, through microphone assembly 1334 in either manner described above in connection with the custom programmer and shown in FIGS. 43 and 44, all of the necessary IR codes into RAM 1324 at the addresses associated with the buttons on the keyboard 1320 according to the consumer's expressed wishes. If this method is used, no IR codes need be stored in the ROM of the custom controller when it is manufactured., 44467=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/000,934, filed Jan. 5, 1993 now abandoned, which is a continuation in part of patent application Ser. No. 07/965,075 filed Oct. 22, 1992, now abandoned, which is a continuation of patent application Ser.

No. 07/289,369, filed Dec. 23, 1988, now abandoned., 221261=Another preferred embodiment of an apparatus for using compressed codes for a recorder programming is the custom programmer 1100 of FIGS. 40 and 41. The custom programmer 1100 is similar to instant programmer 300 and has number keys 1102, which are numbered 0-9, a CANCEL key 1104, a REVIEW key 1106, a WEEKLY key 1108, a ONCE key 1110 and a DAILY (M-F) key 1112, which correspond directly to keys 302-312 of instant programmer 300, and which are used to program the custom programmer 1100. Like the instant programmer 300, a lid normally covers other keys, which are used to set up the instant custom programmer 1100. When lid 1114 is lifted, the following keys are revealed, but not shown in the drawings: SAVE key, ENTER key, CLOCK key, CH key, ADD TIME key, VCR key, CABLE key, and TEST key. These keys of the custom programmer 1100 correspond to and operate substantially the same as keys 316-330 of instant programmer 300, respectively. Also included in the custom programmer 1100 shown in FIG. 40 are: liquid crystal display 1134, red warning light emitting diode 1132 and IR diodes 1134, which correspond to liquid crystal display 350, red warning light emitting diode 332 and IR diodes 342-348 as shown in FIG. 15., 67655=The use of a G-code does not preclude \u201con-screen\u201d confirmation of the program information that has been entered. When the keystrokes \u201cPROG 1138 PROG\u201d are entered with the G-code switch in the \u201cON\u201d position, the G-code would be decoded and the television could display the following message:, 218140=FIG. 34 is a block diagram of a system including a cable box having a G-code decoder 997, a television 952, a VCR 964, and a satellite receiver 986. The user would use the television remote controller 956 or controls on the cable box 997 to enter the code that signifies the program to be recorded. When a G-code is entered, the television remote would send the G-code to cable box 997 with G-code decoder 998 via infrared transmitter 958. An infrared receiver 996 on the cable box 997 would receive the transmission and send the code to the G-code decoder 998, which would decode the code into CDTL and use this information along with a clock, which would also be embedded in the cable box 997, to send the proper commands to the VCR 964 and the satellite receiver 986 at the appropriate time so that the selected program will be recorded at the proper time. The transmission from the cable box 997 would be via infrared transmitters 1000, which can be placed at strategic points on the cable box. The transmission is then received by the VCR 964 via infrared receiver 968 and the satellite receiver 986 via infrared receiver 988. The transmission methods and apparatus of FIGS. 36, 37, 38 and 39 could also be used with the system of FIG. 34 to transmit information from cable box 997 to VCR 964 and satellite receiver 986., 238237=Custom controller 1300 also includes additional buttons on its control surfaces 1302 and 1304 that can used to operate any home electronic device that can be controlled by an infrared remote control. These standard infrared remote controls work by transmitting different IR codes for each different function to be performed by the device being controlled. Each button of the custom controller triggers the transmission of an IR code that would ordinarily be transmitted by another remote control. The actual make up of these IR codes used to control the various home electronic equipment are described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,623,887 to Welles, II which is hereby incorporated by reference., 223664=In order to receive these audio signals, a user may call a special phone number which could be a toll-free 800 number, a pay-per-minute 900 number, or a standard telephone number with standard toll charges applying. The consumer can speak to an operator who orally inquires from the consumer the information regarding the consumer's VCR model and brand, zip code, model and brand of cable box and the newspaper or other publication which the consumer will use to obtain the compressed codes. This is all the information needed to perform the initial set-up for the custom programmer 1100. From the zip code information, the operator can determine to which cable system the consumer is connected and can combine this data with the knowledge of which publication the consumer will use to select the correct local channel mapping table for the consumer., 235585=The invention as shown in the preferred embodiments of the custom programmer 1100 and the initial set-up programmer 1200 can be readily included within televisions, video cassette recorders, cable boxes, or satellite receivers. It would not be complicated to embed either the custom programmer 1100 or the initial set-up programmer 1200 in televisions, video cassette recorders, cable boxes, and satellite receivers by adding suitable cabling or other transmission means between various video devices being used., 217155=Another preferred embodiment of the transmission method and apparatus between equipments is shown in FIG. 39, which is a perspective view of a VCR 370 having an infrared transmitter 1026 inside a stick on miniature mouse 1024 coupled via a cable 1018, which is plugged via plug 1017 into receptacle 1016 on the VCR. The stick on miniature mouse 1024 is stuck onto the cable box very near the infrared receiver 1010. This embodiment is also most useful when the cable box is separated from the VCR by walls of a cabinet, for example, that would prevent either direct or reflective infrared transmission., 243742=In an alternate embodiment, the custom controller can be programmed by either of both of these methods. IR codes that are \u201clearned\u201d from other remote controllers are store in RAM 1324 shown in FIG. 58. Alternatively, ROM 1332 shown in FIG. 1332 includes IR codes for most VCRs, cable boxes, satellite receivers, televisions and stereo components and the ability to program which brand/model of these device he or she is using. In yet another embodiment, the embodiments shown in FIGS. 58 and 59 can be combined by including a flag bit in the data stored in RAM 1324 or 1330. If the flag bit is set, the rest of the data at that address is a ROM address which points to the location of the IR code in ROM 1332. If the flag bit is not set, the rest of the data at that address contains actual IR code data., 236145=Another embodiment of the invention is the custom controller 1300 shown in FIGS. 53-58. The custom controller contains the same circuitry and performs the same functions as the custom programmer 1100, but also perform the functions of a complete universal remote control that can be set up automatically. The custom controller includes on its main control surface 1302 and its auxiliary control surface 1304, buttons that perform the same functions as buttons 1102-1112, 1156 of the custom programmer, a display 1306 that performs the same functions as display 1134, 1154 and IR transmitters 1314 which perform the same functions as IR transmitters 1131, 1158. The custom controller can also be equipped with a lid (not shown) that covers hidden keys (not shown) used to set up the custom controller like lid 1114 on the custom programmer 1100 and lid 316 and keys 316-330 on the instant programmer 300. The keys under the lid could include SAVE, ENTER, CLOCK, CH, ADD TIME, VCR, CABLE and TEST keys like the instant programmer and the custom programmer., 116387=Now for the above example, which combination is more probable: T2 with C1 L1, or C2 with T1 L1, or L2 with T1 C1. This will determine the next bit in the key. So, which is greater: 11\ufffd9.3\ufffd70=7161; 7\ufffd15.8\ufffd70=7742; or 20\ufffd15.8\ufffd9.3=2938.8? In this case the combination with the greatest probability is 7\ufffd15.8\ufffd70=7742, which corresponds to C2 with T1 L1. So, C2 is selected as the next bit in the bit hierarchy key., 225231=The operator will then direct the consumer to place the earpiece 1142 of the telephone receiver 1144 over the microphone opening 1140 of the custom programmer 1100 as generally shown in FIG. 42. The earpiece need not be placed directly against the custom programmer 1100, but may be held more than an inch away from the microphone opening with generally satisfactory results. After a pause sufficient to allow the consumer to place the telephone receiver in the proper position, the operator will initiate the downloading of the initial set-up data and initial set-up programming commands transmitted over the telephone line 1146 using audio signals to the consumer's custom programmer 1100., 216007=Another preferred embodiment of the transmission method and apparatus between equipments is shown in FIG. 37, which is a perspective view showing a cable box 372 placed on top of a VCR 370 having an infrared transmitter 1014 inside a infrared dome 1012 on the top of the VCR which communicates to the cable box infrared receiver 1010 via direct communication or reflection depending on placement of the infrared receiver 1010 relative to infrared dome 1012., 234630=Data is transferred to instant programmer 300 and custom programmer 1100 through the two contact pins 1212. The first of these pins is the ground pin. The second pin connects with test point 392 a shown in FIG. 22. Test point 392 is connected to both an interrupt pin and one input/output (I/O) pin of microcomputer 380. The two pins are tied together with an open collector method so that both input and output can be accomplished with one pin. The two contact pins 1212 connect to the same functional pins of the microcomputer 1150 of the custom programmer 1100. Data is transferred serially through these pins at a 4800 baud rate using TTL voltage levels. The instant programmer 300 and custom programmer 1100 return a low pulse of a predetermined length to the initial set-up programmer 1200 when they have received all of transferred data., 237352=The custom controller includes a microphone 1308, which performs the same functions as microphone 1140 of the custom programmer and is accessible through the microphone access hole 1309. Through the microphone, the custom controller is programmed with all of the set-up information needed to function as an instant or custom programmer (i.e., channel map, current time of day, model/brand of cable box and VCR). Alternatively, the custom controller can be programmed by the initial set-up programmer 1200 shown in FIGS. 45-47 and 49-51 in the identical manner described above in connection with these figures for the instant and custom programmers. Accordingly, the custom controller includes access holes 1310 through which contact can be made with the contact pins 1212 of the set-up programmer 1200., 116960=The next bit is selected in the same way. Which combination is more probable: C3 with T1 L1, or T2 with C1 or C2 and L1, or L2 with C1 or C2 and T1. For the example shown, which has the greatest probability: 8.8\ufffd15.8\ufffd70=9732.8; 11\ufffd(9.3+7)\ufffd70=12551; or 20\ufffd(9.3+7)\ufffd15.8=5150.8? In this case the combination with the greatest probability is 11\ufffd(9.3+7)\ufffd70=12551, which corresponds T2 with C1 or C2 and L1. So, T2 is selected as the next bit in the bit hierarchy key. This procedure is repeated for all the differential probabilities until the entire key is found., 231768=FIG. 48 shows two access holes 1213 in the bottom of the instant programmer 300 that allow access to two contact points on the to the circuit board (not shown) inside the instant programmer 300. FIG. 49 shows the initial set-up programmer 1200 with an instant programmer 300 fit into the depression 1210 with the two contact pins 1212 extending upwards through the access holes 1213 in the bottom of the instant programmer 300. FIG. 50 shows the initial set-up programmer 1200 with a custom programmer 1100 fit into the depression 1210 with the two contact pins 1212 extending upwards through the access holes 1136 in the bottom of the instant programmer 300., 206702=The look up local channel number step 606 looks up the local channel 612 given the assigned channel number 608, in the assigned/local channel table 610, which is setup by the user via the CH key 322, as explained above. An example of the assigned/local channel table 610 is the right two columns of the assigned/local channel table 620 of FIG. 29. The correspondence between the assigned channel numbers, such as 624 and 628, and the local channel numbers, such as 626 and 630 is established during setup by the user. For the example, FIG. 29 shows an exact correspondence between the assigned channel number 5 and the local channel number 5. The last step is the append month and year to day to form date step 614. The correct month and year are obtained from step 568 and are again dependent on whether the day code is equal to or greater than the day from the clock or less than the day from the clock. If the day code is equal to or greater than the day from the clock, the month and year as shown on the clock are used, otherwise the next month is used and the next year is used if the clock month is December. The result is the channel, date, time and length (CDTL) 618, which for the above example would be channel 5, Feb. 10, 1990, 7:00 PM and 1.5 hours in length., 248159=It is noted above that in either of the embodiments shown in FIGS. 58 and 59, the microphone and decoding assemblies from either FIG. 43 or FIG. 44 may be used. Preferably, the microphone and decoding assembly in FIG. 44 is used as it is less expensive than the assembly in FIG. 43 that uses a DTMF decoder 1166. The system shown in FIG. 44 utilizes just two single frequency signals rather than many dual frequency signals as in a DTMF system. The first signal, a tone of approximately 3000 Hz, is used to signify a binary \u201cone\u201d and the second signal, a tone of approximately 500 Hz, is used to signify \u201czero.\u201d Since a 500 Hz signal is being used in this embodiment, the bandwidth of the 1000-5000 Hz high pass filter 1168 from FIG. 44 will have to be broadened to include 500 Hz when included in the microphone and decoder assembly 1334., 205210=The selected permutation method 578 is used in the invert permutation of decimal compressed code step 580. For the example given above, the output of step 580 would be: 328137. The next step is the convert groups of decimal numbers into groups of binary numbers and concatenate binary groups into one binary number step 584, which is the inverse of step 542 of FIG. 27 and for the above example would result in the binary code: 000000001010010000010001001. Then the bit hierarchy key 588 is used in the reorder bits of binary number according to bit hierarchy key step 586, which inverts step 538 of FIG. 27 to obtain 000000000100110000010001001 for the above example, which is . . . TL2TL1 . . . C2C1 . . . D2D1 582 corresponding to 536 of FIG. 27. The next step is to group bits to form three binary numbers TLb, Cb, Db and convert to decimal numbers step 590 resulting in Cp, Dp, TLp 592, which for the example above would be: 4, 9, 19, and which are priority vectors for channel, day and time/length, which in turn are used to look up channel, day, time and length 604 in priority vector channel (C) table 598, priority vector date (D) table 600, and priority vector time/length (TL) table 602, respectively., 228473=As shown in FIG. 43 the audio signals received by microphone 1162 are passed through amplifier 1164 and forwarded through a DTMF decoder circuit and into a serial port of microcomputer 1150. In the alternative circuit shown in FIG. 44, the audio signals received by microphone 1162 are passed through amplifier 1166, through a high pass filter 1166 with a cutoff at approximately 1-5 kHz, and through a second amplifier 1170 to a serial port of microcomputer 1150., 250082=The custom controller has several additional features. First, the rear surface 1312 of the custom controller is large enough so that custom controller can be set on the rear surface as shown in FIG. 61 and resist tipping over. The advantage of being able to stand the custom controller in this upright position is that IR transmitters 1314 are then at a substantial height above the surface on which the custom controller is set. This lessens the probability that pillows, newspapers, magazines or other debris will be inadvertently placed on top of the custom controller as it will be difficult for debris to balance on the top of the custom controller when while in the upright position. Further, stacks of pillows, magazines and other debris placed next to the custom controller must be rather high before they will block the IR transmissions of the custom controller. This feature is extremely important because, unlike the instant programmer which can have a permanent holder next to the cable box and VCR, away from magazines and pillows, the custom controller, having full universal remote capabilities, is designed to be used some distance away from the video equipment. Yet, to function properly as an automatic video recorder controller, the IR transmitters of the custom controller need to have a direct line of sight to the IR receivers of the video equipment to be controlled., 145850=6:30 pm, 244608=In the preferred embodiment of FIGS. 53-60, though, IR codes are programmed into the memory of the custom controller through the microphone 1308 that is used for the set up of the channel map, cable box and VCR brand/model and the current time of day. Using the process shown in FIG. 60, a process similar to that described above in connection with the custom programmer 1100, in block 1340, the user calls either a special phone number which could be a toll-free 800 number, a pay-per-minute 900 number, or a standard telephone number with standard toll charges applying. In block 1342, the consumer speaks on the telephone to a customer service representative (representative) located at a remote site who orally inquires from the consumer the information regarding the brand and model of each home electronic device with which the consumer wants to use custom controller. In blocks 1346 and 1348, the consumer also has the opportunity to tell the representative which functions each button of the control surfaces 1302 and 1304 is to perform. In block 1350, the representative enters this information into a computer at the remote site. If the consumer does not have preferences regarding which button of the custom controller is used to perform which functions, in block 1352, the representative does not enter any preferences into the computer and the computer relies on default associations between the buttons and functions that are previously stored in the computer., 242109=In both the embodiments of FIGS. 58 and 59, the IR code retrieved from either ROM or RAM is sent by the microprocessor to IR transmitters 1328 and is transmitted., 247342=In an alternative embodiment the ROM 1332 contains default associations between IR codes and buttons of the custom controller, so that these associations need not be downloaded unless the consumer has requested associations between buttons and IR codes that are different from the default associations. This method reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent over the telephone lines from the remote site to the custom controller, but can increase the size and cost of the ROM installed in the custom controller. In the rare case where the IR codes for the device that the consumer wants to control are not included in the ROM, the computer would just download the IR codes themselves for that device as in the first programming method described above with reference to FIG. 58.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is thought that the universal remote that includes apparatus and method using compressed codes for television program record scheduling of the present invention and many of its attendant advantages will be understood from the foregoing description and it will be apparent that various changes may be made in the form, construction and arrangement of the parts thereof without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the form hereinbefore described being merely a preferred or exemplary embodiment thereof. Yet another feature of the custom controller are one touch channel tuning buttons. These buttons would be assigned to a specific television or cable channel such as HBO, ESPN, CNN or MTV. For example, if a button is assigned to CNN, when the CNN button is pressed, the custom controller transmits IR codes to change the channel on a television, VCR, cable box or satellite receiver to the channel number on which CNN is broadcast. When the consumer sets up the custom controller, he or she tells the representative what channels he or she watches the most and the representative directs the computer to have selected keys on the custom controller be programmed to tune these channels. The consumer tells the representative which keys on the custom controller he or she wishes to tune which channels or the representative can select the keys. After the keys and channels have",
