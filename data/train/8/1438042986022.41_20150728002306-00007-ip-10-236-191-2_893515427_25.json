    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments What to do for fun this is not a place for fun this is just mostly for classes and to leave. the way a person can have fun is joining sports like high schools are. Food and Dining the food and dining is not the worst. i would say the food and dining is average just about any Dorm Life no dorms are at this campus, since this is a 2 year community college. Academic Rigor some of the professors are very good teachers i will not lie. this is why a person should check with other students or online aid before selecting a professor for a class. Tips for prospective students go to counselors more; than, once a semester, since they don't help as much. mostly a person will wait 3 hours for a counselor and still not end up with a great counselor. In three sentences modesto junior college is for people; who, can't afford universities and if pretty inexpensive. this college gives you what you pay for and that is counselors; that, hardly help the students. also,",
