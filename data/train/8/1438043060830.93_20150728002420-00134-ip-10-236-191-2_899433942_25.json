            "This school is great for students who want to learn and aren't afraid of doing so. The courses are usually tough but the professors are always there for you and will do all they can to help you pass their class.",
            "The campus seems big however, it is very easy to navigate and if you get lost all you have to do is ask someone and they are more than willing to help you out. The sports teams are amazing and help create that sense of family and community since you're all in it for the same reason. You really become family with your roommates and hall-mates and you miss them when you go home for vacations. This school has amazing scenery and it's easy to get caught up in how beautiful it is."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia Tech\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s History. We don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 925204=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck College is a huge expense, but worth it. Tech offers many ways to help pay for the expense which is very helpful. Am enjoying being here Virginia Tech is great. I have met so many amazing people from so many different backgrounds which have exposed me to things I may have never encountered. Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.
