Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871. For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see Understanding Windows automatic updating., 5401=What is the Microsoft Excel Viewer?\u00a0 The Microsoft Excel Viewer is a replacement for all previous Excel Viewer versions, including Excel Viewer 97 and Excel Viewer 2003. With Excel Viewer, you can open, view, and print Excel workbooks, even if you don't have Excel installed. You can also copy data from Excel Viewer to another program. However, you cannot edit data, save a workbook, or create a new workbook., 6149=What components of the Microsoft Of fice Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?\u00a0 The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin., 7759=How is this security update related to MS10-087 and MS10-088?\u00a0 The Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB2505924) update offered in this bulletin also addresses the vulnerabilities described in the MS10-087 and MS10-088 security bulletins., 9166=Why is this update only Important for all affected versions of Excel?\u00a0 Microsoft Excel 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit., 19174=This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Excel 2002, Microsoft Excel 2003, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Microsoft Office for Mac 2011; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; and all supported versions of Microsoft Excel Viewer and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack. For more information, see the subsection, Affected and Non-Affected Software, in this section., 646=The following severity ratings assume the potential maximum impact of the vulnerability. For information regarding the likelihood, within 30 days of this security bulletin's release, of the exploitability of the vulnerability in relation to its severity rating and security impact, please see the Exploitability Index in the April bulletin summary. For more information, see Microsoft Exploitability Index., 7359=MS11-022 and MS11-023 also describe vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2004 fo r Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. MS11-022 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office for Mac 2011. How do MS11-022 and MS11-023 relate to this bulletin, MS11-021?\u00a0 The security update packages for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB2505924), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB2505927), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB2505935) offered in this bulletin also address the vulnerabilities described in the MS11-022 and MS11-023 security bulletins. The security update package for Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 (KB2525412) offered in this bulletin also addresses the vulnerabilities described in MS11-022. Users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, Open XML File Format Converter for Mac, or Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 installed will only need to install these security update packages once., 10603=[1]For Microsoft Excel 2007 Service Pack 2, in addition to security update package KB2464583, customers also need to install the security update for Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats Service Pack 2 (KB2466156) to be protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin., 19849=Published: April 12, 2011, 8341=Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?\u00a0 Yes. The updates for Microsoft Excel 2003 Service Pack 3 (KB2502786) and Microsoft Excel 2007 Service Pack 2 (KB2464583), in conjunction with the update offered in MS11-023, provide support for the Office File Validation feature.
