He had a long run-up, unwound at the crease like a slimline Merv Hughes, and found lavish movement off the seam, particularly away from the left-handers. He dropped too short occasionally, but when in the groove with the reverse swing working, he could be irresistible: Headley took three hat-tricks for Kent in 1996 alone, and sliced through Australia at Melbourne in 1998-99. His record for England is good, even if injury and loss of form have limited his chances. His batting wasn't quite in the same class as his grandfather, George, or father, Ron, but he's a handy nightwatchman with a nice line in straight drives and square cuts. He was awarded one of the ECB's 12 central contracts for 2000, but his persistent back injury forced him into an early retirement.
