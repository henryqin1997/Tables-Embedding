            "Cowbells are MSU's well known tradition! The cowbell symbolizes good luck, and we bring these cowbells to every sporting event to bring our teams luck! However, you cannot buy yourself one; someone has to buy you one!",
            "Yes! This university gives you everything plus more! You will not be disappointed!",

            "Most dorms are beautiful! You can choose what type of dorm you want, but it will cost you! However, most dorms are pretty spacious; some have their own bathrooms, and some have a community bathroom.",
            "Depends on the person. What's vigorous for me might be a piece of cake for you! However, if you don't understand something their are plenty of people that are willing to help you-I promise!",
            "The best tip I can give is get involved, get involved, and get involved! Exposing yourself to positive people will create a fun experience on campus. However, maintain your focus in school; you can not get too caught up on a social life; you must stay focus.",
            "Mississippi State University is an outstanding institution. This university provides their students with functions on and off campus to further their academic and social growth. Also, this campus is a enormous diverse family-you can feel a keen sense of unity here."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck MSU is one of the cheapest colleges in the nations, even if a student comes from out of state or is a non-resident. You receive great information compared to other colleges and you pay less tuition compared to other colleges. Am enjoying being here MSU is in a small town so fun things to do is movies and a roller skating place. However, The campus life is really good. We have places to shop and other dining places besides the cafeteria in the Student's Union. The enjoyment part is the parties that are done by students/roommates and also during the football season, it feels great being in the stadium surrounded by students who shake their cowbells. Am learning a lot The teachers are really good and friendly. But besides that, the information they give us helps us learn a lot. They provide us with needed materials that students later on use in their chosen careers. If a student does not understand something, he or she can always go to a teacher's office or a tutor provided by the university to receive more help and this helps the student learn a lot.
