There are probably going to be some marriages that were not announced in either of those two newspapers. You can also check the vital record index that are in the Rochester Public Library and 10 other locations around the State. See this web page for those locations. You can order a copy of the marriage record from the NY State Department of Health in Albany. They charge $22 for an uncertified copy for genealogical research and take up to about 8 months to get a copy to you. The Rochester City Hall only asks $10 for a one year search (& copy) and $1 for another year. Go to this web page for an online PDF form to order from Rochester City Hall.
