    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{59204=The adhesive layer 120 may be a pressure sensitive adhesive layer, a moisture activatable adhesive layer or a heat activatable adhesive layer. The adhesive may comprise any pressure sensitive, moisture activatable or heat activatable adhesive known in the art for use with film substrates. The adhesive layer 120 may be in the form of a continuous or discontinuous layer, and may comprise one or a mixture of two or more adhesives. The adhesive layer may be in the form of a patterned adhesive layer with a relatively strong adhesive in some areas and a relatively weak adhesive in other areas. In one embodiment, the adhesive layer provides initial tack and allows slight movement of the laminate to allow positioning adjustments prior to forming a permanent bond. In one embodiment, the adhesive permits facilitated stripping of the dry paint film layer from a substrate when use of the paint film layer is no longer desired. The adhesive may comprise a rubber based adhesive, acrylic adhesive, vinyl ether adhesive, silicone adhesive, or mixture of two or more thereof. The adhesive may be applied as a hot melt, solvent-based or water based adhesive. Included are adhesive materials described in \u201cAdhesion and Bond\u201d, Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Vol. 1, pages 476-546, Interscience Publishers, 2nd Ed. 1985, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The adhesive materials that are useful may contain as a major constituent an adhesive polymer such as an acrylic-type polymer; block copolymer; natural, reclaimed, or styrene-butadiene rubber; tackified natural or synthetic rubber; a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate; an ethylene-vinyl-acrylic terpolymer; polyisobutylene; poly (vinyl ether); etc. Other materials may be included in the adhesive such as tackifying resins, plasticizers, antioxidants, fillers, waxes, etc., 35357=The present application is a continuation of and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd120 to commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 10/367,611, filed Feb. 14, 2003, now abandoned, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 94290=A matte release coat corresponding to first release coating layer 135 is applied to the other side of the backing liner using gravure at a coat weight of 4.4-4.6 gsm. The formulation for the matte release coat is as follows: 50.54% by weight methylisobutyl ketone, 7.84% by weight isopropanol, 8.93% by weight Lankyd 13-1425, 10.68% by weight VAGH (product of Union Carbide identified as hydroxy modified polyvinyl chloride/polyvinyl acetate copolymer), 22% by weight Microtalc MP 15-38, 2% by weight Cycat 4040, and 6.8% by weight Cymel 303. The matte release coat is dried using forced hot air at a temperature of 149\ufffd C., 94953=A first coat of a transparent film layer corresponding to transparent film layer 140 is applied to the matte release coat using gravure at a coat weight of 1.3-2 gsm and dried using forced hot air at a temperature of 120\ufffd C. The dry film thickness is 0.05-0.1 mil. The formulation for this first transparent film layer coat is as follows: 41.5% by weight methyl ethyl ketone, 41.5% by weight methyl isobutyl ketone, and 17% by weight Elvacite 2042 (a product of Lucite International identified as a polymethyl methacrylate)., 81104=A matte release coat corresponding to first release coating layer 135 is applied to the other side of the backing liner using gravure at a coat weight of 6.5-7.75 gsm. The formulation for the matte release coat is as follows: 26% by weight methylisobutyl ketone, 6% by weight isopropanol, 34.8% by weight Lankyd 13-1425 (a product supplied by Akzo Resins identified as an acrylic modified alkyd), 2.6% by weight Elvacite 2042 (a product supplied by Lucite International identified as a polyethyl methacrylate polymer), 30% by weight Microtalc MP 15-38 (a product supplied by Barrett's Minerals identified as a talc extender pigment), 2.5% by weight Cycat 4040 (a product supplied by Cytec identified as paratoluene sulfonic acid) and 8.7% by weight Cymel 303 (a product supplied by Cytec identified as a melamine resin). The matte release coat is dried using forced hot air at a temperature of 149\ufffd C., 139985=A matte release coat corresponding to first release coating layer 135 is applied to the other side of the backing liner using gravure at a coat weight of 4.4-4.6 gsm. The formulation for the matte release coat is as follows: 50.54% by weight methylisobutyl ketone, 7.84% by weight isopropanol, 8.93% by weight Lankyd 13-1425, 10.68% by weight VAGH (product of Union Carbide identified as hydroxy modified polyvinyl chloride/polyvinyl acetate copolymer), 22% by weight Microtalc MP 15-38, 2% by weight Cycat 4040, and 6.8% by weight Cymel 303. The matte release coat is dried using forced hot air at a temperature of 149\ufffd C., 67139=Release coating layer 135 may contain one or more solid particulates that project into the surface 114 of dry paint film layer 110 or the surface 141 of transparent film layer 140 to provide the surfaces 114 or 141 with a matte or flat finish. When particulates are present, the release coating layer 135 may be referred to as a matte release coat or matte release coating layer. The particulates that may be used may be any of the filler pigments described above for use in the paint film layers. Specific examples include talc and aluminum silicate. Particulates with irregular shapes (e.g., platelet shapes) may be used. By controlling the use of these particulates the surface finish of the dry paint film layer or the transparent film layer may be controlled. For example, by using these particulates, the dry paint film layer or the transparent film layer may be provided with a flat or semi-gloss finish. The paint film layer or transparent film layer may be provided with a glossy finish by not using or minimizing the use of these particulates. The weight ratio of particulates to resin or binder may range up to about 1.1:1, and in one embodiment about 0.7:1 to about 1.1:1, and in one embodiment from about 0.7:1 to about 0.9:1, and in one embodiment about 0.9:1 to about 1.1:1.}",
