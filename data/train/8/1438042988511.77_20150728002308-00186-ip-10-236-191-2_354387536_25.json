In the mobile examination centers (MECs) and analytical laboratories, data for the laboratory component is recorded directly onto a computerized data collection form. The system is centrally integrated and it allows for ongoing monitoring of much of the data. While the complete blood count and pregnancy analyses are performed in the MEC laboratory, most analyses are conducted elsewhere by 21 laboratories across the United States., 10325=For the survey years, the eligible sample was as follows: in 1999, there was a one-fourth subsample of persons 20\u201359 years; in 2000, there was a one-third subsample of persons 20\u201359 years. There were no component-specific exclusions., 1865=The dataset includes 2-year subsample weights. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively), which are included in the demographic data file for each data release.

The medical technologists hold baccalaureates in medical technology. The American Society for Clinical Pathologists or a similar organization certifies the medical technologists and the phlebotomists. All laboratory staff complete comprehensive training in standardized laboratory procedures before they begin working in the MEC.}",
