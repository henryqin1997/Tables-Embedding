I loved all of the classes I took over the last two years and I would recommend every single one of my teachers. I felt that each teacher was passionate about teaching and was very active in engaging students, which I k ow is not always easy. I have found that when I am on a school break, I long to be back in school and I think that part of the reason for this is because Red Rocks is a great school. One more thing I would like to add that I particularly liked about RRCC is the small campus!!
