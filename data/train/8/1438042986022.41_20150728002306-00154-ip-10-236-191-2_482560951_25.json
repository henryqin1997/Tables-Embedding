    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6430=FIG. 1 depicts a wireless network containing an intrusion detection system (IDS) particularly focused on wireless events, according to the present invention. Such a wireless intrusion detection system (WID system or WIDS) monitors a specific geographic area to discover both authorized and unauthorized access points and authorized and unauthorized client machines that may be trying to connect to the wireless network. These access points and client machines are, collectively, wireless access devices. In one embodiment, the WID system has two functional parts: one or more WIDS nodes (or simply \u201cnodes\u201d) that collect data from access points and clients; and one or more WIDS collectors (or simply \u201ccollectors\u201d) that collect the raw data from the WIDS nodes using an out-of-band means. The raw data (e.g., intrusion and status information) from the WIDS nodes can be stored in a database for access by a local web based management console, or sent to any Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) client software by the WIDS collector. Other features of a WID system are discussed in a related pending, commonly owned application filed May 17, 2002, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Wireless Intrusion Detection,\u201d U.S. application Ser. No. 10/147,308, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.}",

Web page 1004 is a login page, where various users could access information about the WID system. In an embodiment, a user would login to access the WID system over the Internet. Alternatively, the user could login to access the WID system over a private network, such as a corporate intranet. A user can have one or more authorization levels. In an embodiment, the authorization levels can include a customer client, customer administrator, field engineer, or root administrator. A customer client or customer administrator can be associated with different groups or business units within the customer organization., 190472=(3) Field Engineer Level interface 1036 (which includes all of the Customer Client Level and Customer Administrator Level privileges described above) provides access to the following additional functions and accessibility:, 191653=(4) Root Administrator Level interface 1044 (which includes all privileges described above for the Customer Client Level, Customer Administrator Level, and Field Engineer Level) provides access to the following root level functions and accessibility:, 189265=(2) Customer Administrator Level interface 1028 (which includes all of the Customer Client Level privileges described above) provides access to the following additional functions and accessibility:, 28731=This application is a divisional of prior co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The previous description of the disclosed embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. Various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein. . The POC table allows the WID system to manage the level of access of each user. Via entry of a username and associated password authentication, the corresponding privileges will be granted to each specific user. Attempts to access different levels within the web page that are outside of the specific privileges associated with a user can cause a login window to appear, which will prompt the users to enter additional authentication information to gain the access to a specific level. FIG. 9 According to the different access levels listed above, a POC table that maintains the roles of users is created in the database depicted in View userlog data 1078: This interface allows viewing from the management console of the log of WIDS collector access attempts by users.
