In an earlier era of rf/microwave testing, the measurement environment could almost always be assumed to be 50 ohms (or perhaps 75 ohms in the video-related world). Matching Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful and accurate method for measuring corrosion rates. The corrosion rate at the monitored interface is proportional to the charge transfer resistance or polarization resistance. The actual relationship requires modeling of the interface Measuring Low Value Resistance / Impedance A broad range of systems include components with very low resistance/ impedance values such as current meters, force measurement devices, temperature sensors, battery/fuel cells, etc. Such impedance values can be in the range of 0.001 ohm to 0.1 ohm (maybe even smaller). In many cases Distortion and source impedance in JFET-input op amps of two JFET-input op amps for high and low source impedance. A new fabrication process that limits common mode capacitance provides more device options when low distortion is required over a wide range of source impedance.",
