            "ENCODING APPARATUS AND ENCODING METHOD - To ease operations by a user carried out for compression-encoding video data and mitigate operational errors that might be caused upon the compression-encoding. In an encoding apparatus, an encode information input accepting section accept an input of first encode information used when video data is compression-encoded, a parameter setting section sets a parameter used when each short section is compression-encoded as a first parameter on the basis of the first encode information, an output section displays a change screen for changing the parameter while following a previously created chapter file, a parameter change section change the parameter from the first parameter to a second parameter on the basis of change information, a GOP configuration determination section determines a GOP configuration by using the first parameter while following the chapter file, and a compression-encoding section",
            "METHOD OF SELECTING A DESTINATION NODE, NODE AND RECORDING MEDIUM - A monitoring node periodically transmits an active/inactive monitoring signal to selection target nodes. Upon receipt of the active/inactive monitoring signal, each selection target node calculates a current subscriber accommodated ratio, which is load information, creates an active/inactive monitoring response signal based on the load information, and transmits the active/inactive monitoring response signal to the monitoring node. Upon receipt of the active/inactive monitoring response signal from the selection target node, the monitoring node extracts the load information from the active/inactive monitoring response signal, determines the relevant acquisition ratio based on the load information, and performs the selection procedure of a destination node based on the determined acquisition ratio."
