            "METHOD FOR RESOLUTION OF A MIXTURE OF PINOCEMBRIN OPTICAL ISOMERS, ESPECIALLY A PINOCEMBRIN RACEMATE - The present invention relates to a method for resolution of a mixture of pinocembrin optical isomers, in particular a pinocembrin racemate, using a chiral primary amine or a chiral sulfinamide. The present invention also relates to a (R)-(+)-pinocembrin obtained by the method.",
            "TWO TYPES OF CRYSTALLINE OF PINOCEMBRIN, THEIR PREPARATION AND THEIR USE FOR MANUFACTURE OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS - Two crystalline forms of pinocembrin of formula (I): \u03b1 and \u03b2, their preparation and their use for manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. There exists difference between them in bioavailability. They are used for treating and preventing cerebral ischemic diseases by protective action of neurovascular unit, and enhancing blood drug level in vivo.",
            "INCLUSION COMPLEXES OF PINOCEMBRIN WITH CYCLODEXTRIN OR ITS DERIVATIVES - Inclusion complexes of pinocembrin with cyclodextrin or its derivatives and their preparation are provided. The inclusion complexes can be used to make drugs.",
            "USE OF RACEMATES OF PINOCEMBRIN IN PREPARING MEDICAMENTS FOR TREATING STROKE - Use of a racemate of pinocembrin, a racemate of pinocembrin salt, a racemate of pinocembrin precursor or a racemate of pinocembrin hydrate in manufacture of a medicament for prophylaxis and treatment of stroke. Particularly, use of pinocembrin racemate in manufacture of a medicament for treatment of acute ischemic stroke."

The CS paging message is received when a packet switched (PS) service is active at the multi-mode communication device. A PS precedence feature is activated at the multi-mode communication device that prioritizes PS communications over CS communications. A CS bearer connection is established with a CS network in response to receiving the CS paging message, and an incoming call notification message that identifies a calling party is received from the CS network. Upon receipt of the incoming call notification message, the CS bearer connection with the CS network is released. A notification of a missed incoming call from the calling party is displayed (e.g., substantially in real-time) via a user interface. 20130142088 05-02-2013 Reducing In-Device Interference Between Multiple Wireless Communications of a Multi-Mode Mobile",
