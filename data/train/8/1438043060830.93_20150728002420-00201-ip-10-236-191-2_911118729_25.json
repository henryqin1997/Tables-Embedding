            "Very nice, very responsive, and always there to help. As long as you are not doing anything completely idiotic the police leave you alone.",
            "Greek life is a very large part of the campus. They take a lot of pride and are always doing something in the community.",
            "There are hundreds of clubs that are all run by the students. There is something for everyone and there is always something to keep you busy. The activities the school organizations put on are fun. Events include but are not limited to: Midnight pizza, karaoke night, bingo, movies and concerts.",
            "Business students certainly have the upper hand right now as they just built a brand new business school. Students who want to get away from the city life would be perfect. It is literally in the middle of nowhere and you have to find stuff to do on campus.",
            "The Quad is somewhere you will always see people at. It is a nice place to catch a tan in the summer, or have a snowball fight in the winter.",
            "If you get into your major at an early stage in the game, you will be getting much more bang for the buck. It is difficult to get into classes due to large demand, so the quicker you get them done, the higher the chances are that you will graduate on time.",
            "There is many things that you can do for fun on campus. If you live in a dorm, the assistance organize many events throughout the semester so there is always something to do. There is a game room with many pool tables, ping pong, video games, and computers. You can join hundreds of clubs, and even plan intramural sports.",
            "The commons are nice at first, but eventually get old. There is not much of a variety at the other places unfortunately. However, they just built a subway and another Starbucks on campus, so there is another option.",
            "The dorms are not new, but the ones that are very old, they are redoing. They are bigger then some dorms at other schools. All the dorms are located pretty close to one another so it is easy to go visit friends.",
            "The classes are not very hard to the point where you want to give up, but they give a nice challenge so that it is much harder than high school.",
            "Try to decide what you want your major to be early on. The earlier you decide, the sooner you can start the classes for it. Bloomsburg is difficult to get into classes because they are growing so quickly and do not yet have the teachers they need to keep up with demand.",
            "Bloomsburg University is a diverse and opportunistic school. Bloomsburg gives students many opporitunities that many other schools may not be able to offer. Bloomsburg University would be rated 8/10 for local state schools."

Nearly all have their terminal Ph.D. degrees, and they have good, credible experience teaching and doing research in the field.

If you are interested in any of these, this school could be the one for you. Class sizes are variable. There are large lectures and small sized classes for almost all of the courses, so do not fret the stereotypical 300+ student class. For the",
