This means breaking big masses of functionality into discrete services and libraries that do one thing well. Such a design tends to yield smaller, more cohesive services, and provides natural lines along which our team can subdivide., 114867=Jun 4th, 2013, 23362=Jan 30th, 2014, 142604=Copyright \u00a9 2014 - 99designs - Privacy Policy - Terms of Use - Powered by Octopress, 110520=Our Javascript similarly needed to be prepared for translation, with rich client-side pages the worst hit. All strings needed to be hoisted to a part of the JS file which could be marked up for translation. String concatenation was no longer ok, since it made flawed assumptions about the grammar of other languages. Strings served through a JSON API were likewise hidden from translation, meaning we had to find other ways to serve the same data., 65749=need make titl look better take text top adjust remain element offic los angel mayor eric garcetti partnership ucla labor center rosenberg foundat california communiti foundat california endow asian americans/pacif island philanthropi cordial invit close recept also add hashtag bottom descriptor dreamsummer13 take rsvp august 19 2013, 46970=Jan 22nd, 2014, 92387=Jul 1st, 2013, 113052=Over time, we repeatedly found our translation queue clogged with huge numbers of strings awaiting translation. Many of these cases were bugs where we hadn\u2019t appropriately marked up user-generated content, but the most stubborn were due to our long-tail marketing efforts. Having a page for each combination of industry, product category and city led to an explosion of strings to translate. Tackling these properly would require a natural language generation engine with some understanding of each language\u2019s grammar. For now we\u2019ve simply excluded these pages from our translation efforts., 116374=When your app starts up (in development), it should make a request to http://localhost:11111/assets/manifest.json, which provides a JSON hash linking asset names (e.g. \u201capplication.css\u201d) to the relative URLs the compiled assets can be fetched from. To generate a link to an asset in your app, use the JSON hash you fetched to lookup the URL. For example, the URL for \u201capplication.css\u201d this might look like http://localhost:11111/application-8e5bf6909b33895a72899ee43f5a9d53.css., 19651=Mar 31st, 2014, 121872=Oct 30th, 2012, 23650=At 99designs we heavily (ab)use Varnish to make our app super fast, but also to do common, simple tasks without having to invoke our heavy-by-contrast PHP stack.

So, for example, \u201cbusiness card\u201d was broken into \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201ccard\u201d, and the importance of those words appearing together was lost. Bigrams are simply pairs of words that appear next to each other. So, if we include both unigrams and bigrams, the text \u201cbusiness card\u201d would provide us the features \u201cbusiness\u201d, \u201ccard\u201d and \u201cbusiness card\u201d.
