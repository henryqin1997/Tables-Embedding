            "Method of controlling an internal combustion engine, in particular a diesel engine - In a method for controlling an internal combustion engine, in particular a diesel internal combustion engine, at least one variable is formed on a cylinder-specific basis, which variable characterizes a respective profile of a combustion in an associated combustion chamber, and the control of cylinder-specific fuel injection parameters is influenced as a function of said at least one variable which characterizes the combustion profile.",
            "METHOD FOR OPERATING AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE - In a method for operating an internal combustion engine comprising at least one a cylinder with a combustion chamber, wherein by means of at least one detection device assigned to the combustion chamber a first value characterizing the pressure in the combustion chamber is detected, wherein on the basis of the first value at least a second value characterizing a progression of the energy released during a combustion in the combustion chamber is determined, on the basis of the second value at least a third value is determined, by means of which the progression of the combustion is subdivided into at least two sub-curves and one of the sub-curves is assigned to a normal combustion for operation of the internal combustion engine and the other of the sub-curves is assigned to a special combustion differing from the normal combustion."
