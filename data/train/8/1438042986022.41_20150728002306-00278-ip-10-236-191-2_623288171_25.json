            "The data are collected using a Cessna 310 aircraft. The NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) laser scanner collects the data using a green (532-nm) raster scanning laser while a digital camera acquires a visual record of the flight. The data are stored on hard drives and archived at the U.S. Geological Survey, FISC office in St. Petersburg, FL, and the NASA office at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The navigational data are processed at Wallops Flight Facility. The navigational and raw data are then downloaded into the Advanced Lidar Processing System (ALPS). Data are converted from units of time to x,y,z points for elevation. The derived surface data can then be converted into raster data (GeoTIFFs).",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center received the data in LAS format. The files contained Lidar elevation and intensity measurements. The data were projected in UTM coordinates (NAD83; Zone 15N) and referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) using the Geoid03 model. The following processes were performed to make the data available within the Digital Coast: 1. The data were converted from UTM (NAD83; Zone 15N) to geographic coordinates (NAD83). 2. The data were converted from NAVD88 (orthometric) heights to GRS80 (ellipsoidal) heights using the Geoid03 model. 3. The data were reclassified to reflect a bare earth surface (class 0 to class 2). 4. The LAS data were sorted by latitude and the headers were updated."
