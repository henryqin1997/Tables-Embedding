            "the university sends out safety alerts if anything unsafe happens on campus. also, you can call campus police and get an escort whenever you have to go somewhere. i used it so many times when i came home late and didn't want to walk from my parking garage. of course, there is always going to be the dangers of living in a city. always walk with a friend at night just to be safe.",

            "being right downtown, students don't have to go far to have fun. csu has many events planned, such as movie nights. also, right around the corner is the wolstein center where csu basketball plays their home games and concerts are held. also, down the road is progressive field, the brown's stadium, and quicken loans arena. many events are held at the q. there are many clubs around too, for people that like to go out at night.",
            "the cafeteria tries to make all the food healthy. while this is a good thing, it kind of sucks the flavor out of the food. there is always plenty of food and is set up buffet-style.",
            "the dorms are beautiful in euclid commons, apartment like. my dorm has 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a full kitchen, living room. there is an additional fee to get your own bedroom, but it is well worth the privacy. sometimes it does get a little loud since it is located right in the middle of downtown.",
            "the education is excellent, however, i had some problems understanding some of my professors accents.",
            "attend the school more than once before deciding.",

I am so happy to be attending CSU in the fall of 2012., 130616=Before attending CSU in 1997, I was very skeptical about applying because of the reputation it had regarding racism. I have mixed feelings about CSU due to my personal academic experiences. I believe that money is more important than the students, at CSU., 478833=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 425748=If you're starting out as a freshman prepare to be in debt! Fall and Spring semesters cost around $5000 for a full-time schedule. That doesn't include books, food, supplies, and every other educational expense. I transferred from a community college where a full-time semester cost about $1200-$1500. CSU also has University partnership programs with some community colleges. You attend CSU classes through the community college and it's cheaper., 219755=The Penthouse 2011-2012}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot All right all of you incoming freshmen, listen up! Cleveland State University is a GREAT school. I am shocked at how much effort is put into helping out the students. This is only my second year in college, however, the professors that I have had so far have all been amazing. I feel that everyday I'm getting close with the faculty which is great because I can one day become a colleague of theirs. (Which would be a great.) Of course, some classes are much harder than others and a lot of work has to be put in in order to make the grade, but to work hard and have it all pay off is definitely worth it. There is always a lot of material to learn, but just keep focused and you'll come out on top.
