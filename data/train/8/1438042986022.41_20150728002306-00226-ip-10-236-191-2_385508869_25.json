Rockefeller moved into an office of commission brokers in Cleveland, Ohio, and soon after became a partner in his own firm, Clark & Rockefeller.\u00a0 In 1859, oil was discovered in Pennsylvania and the visionary Rockefeller took an early interest in these developments, travelling to Pennsylvania to see for himself what this new industry might have to offer.\u00a0 Although the industry was highly unstable in these early days, Rockefeller saw the great potential of oil.\u00a0 In 1863, in partnership with a British engineer named Samuel Andrews, Rockefeller invested $4,000 in the construction of a refinery in Cleveland, Ohio, and took the first steps to becoming one of the richest men in the world.\u00a0 Within two years, Rockefeller bought out his partner (Clark) and the firm became known as Rockefeller & Andrews.\u00a0 By 1870 the business had expanded rapidly and in June of that year all their interests were incorporated as the Standard Oil Company (Ohio).\u00a0 The business continued to grow rapidly and on 27 April 1888 acquired their first foreign affiliate which was named the Anglo-American Oil Company, destined to become one of the largest companies in Great Britain involved in the bulk transportation of oil products.\u00a0 The Company opened offices at 16 Great St. Helens, London, later moving to Dock House, Billiter Street, and later 22 Billiter Street., 260977=Laid up at

the British Isles and Dublin, Ireland.\u00a0 By the turn of the century, the ships were increasing in size, up to 8,400 DWT.\u00a0 In 1903 the Company took delivery of its largest ship until then, the 9,196 GRT NARRAGANSETT, at that time the largest oil tanker in the world and the largest vessel to be built in the lower reaches of the Clyde, from the Yard of Scott & Coy of Greenock., 178677=B/U

and sales, whereas responsibility for the provision of tonnage and management of the tanker fleet had been covered by the Esso Transportation Company Limited from 1947.\u00a0 In 1951, with the new refinery at Fawley about to begin production, the Anglo-American Oil Company became a major producer of petroleum products and its whole scope of activities changed.\u00a0 The transportation aspect also greatly increased at this time with increased distribution and requirements to feed the new refinery.\u00a0 Consequently it was decided to re-assume control of the tanker fleet and set up a Marine Department to take responsibility for the management and operation of the fleet, maintenance and repairs of the ships, new construction, and the chartering of vessels.\u00a0 With these changes came a change of Company name, from the Anglo-American Oil Company to the Esso Petroleum Company Limited.\u00a0 In a similar manner, the parent Company in the USA, the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), had been transferred to a new subsidiary Company in 1950, the Esso Shipping Company., 189591=1951, 220276=When built in Sweden, the \u2018Esso Fawley\u2019 class at just over 18,000 TDW were the largest vessels in Esso\u2019s coastal fleet and were designed for distributing refined products from the Fawley and Milford Haven refineries.\u00a0 They became frequent users of the Dingle tanker buoy berth in the River Mersey, completed in August 1967, and connected to the onshore Dingle Bank Oil Storage Facility adjacent to the Herculaneum Branch Dock, where importation of oil first began in 1892.\u00a0 Two oil engines, geared to a single controllable-pitch propeller, giving the vessels a speed of 16.25 knots powered these ships.\u00a0 (A third vessel of the same class, the Esso Slagen, was completed by A/B Lindholmens, in October of 1968, for Esso Norske of Oslo)., 78445=Bombed & B/U in 1940, 87785=Collision loss -1943, 26610=Submarine Loss in 1941, 94879=Was still afloat in 1950,

Petroleum Corporation Limited and was incorporated in 1920.\u00a0 On its formation, the Company acquired 406 acres in Hampshire that was to become the new Fawley refinery and oil storage depot.\u00a0 The first of the Company\u2019s vessels, the newly built S.S. Agwilake, landed the first oil at Fawley on 18 June 1921, discharging 1,398 tons of Mexican crude oil, 5,843 tons of fuel oil and 2,677 tons of gas oil.\u00a0 In 1921 the facility had storage capacity of 99,000 tons.\u00a0 In 1923, A.G.W.I.
