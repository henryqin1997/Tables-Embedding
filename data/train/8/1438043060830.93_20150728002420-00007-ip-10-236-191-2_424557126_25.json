            "Spatial Phase Feature Location - Methods for locating an alignment mark on a substrate are described. Generally, the substrate includes one or more locator marks adjacent to a substrate alignment mark. Locator marks provide the relative location of the substrate alignment mark such that the substrate alignment mark may be used in aligning a substrate with a template within a lithographic system with a reduced magnitude of relative displacement.",
            "Alignment Using Moire Patterns - Methods of determining relative spatial parameters between two substrates in a process of alignment are described. Generally, multiple alignment data may be collected from phase information using a pair of alignment marks.",
            "Enhanced Multi Channel Alignment - An imprint lithography system operable for imprinting a pattern into a material deposited between an imprint mold and a substrate, the system including, inter alia, a first set of imaging units positioned at a first angle relative to normal of the substrate; and a second set of imaging units positioned at a second angle relative to normal of the substrate, wherein the first and second angles are not equal to each other.",
            "Interferometric Analysis Method for the Manufacture of Nano-Scale Devices - The present invention features a method to determine relative spatial parameters between two coordinate systems, which may be a mold and a region of a substrate in which mold is employed to generate a pattern. The method includes sensing relative alignment between the two coordinate systems at multiple points and determines relative spatial parameters therebetween. The relative spatial parameters include a relative area and a relative shape."
