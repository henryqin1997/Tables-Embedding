It's a great way to get your generals done and by taking a variety of classes, maybe you can narrow down your decision by seeing what you like/dislike. If you are thinking about transferring to a four year college after going to a two year, DMACC offers a few 2+2 programs that will help make a smooth transfer. It will also be cheaper than many other colleges. Tips for prospective students There are many resources that are offered for students, so use them to your advantage. If you ever are struggling in a certain class, seek out some extra help. The Academic Achievement Center at DMACC can help out with a lot of different subject areas including math, writing, science, and other areas.",
