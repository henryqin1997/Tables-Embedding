However, according to the MHD, these fluctuations may be in part attributable to different reporting rates by different jurisdictions. The EB does not account for fluctuations by individual town. The difference in reporting between 2003 (the year before the advance street name signs were installed) and 2005 (the year after they were installed) is very pronounced in some towns and cities. To illustrate this large fluctuation in total reported crashes in some towns, table 4 displays the total reported crashes from 2002 to 2006 for 10 cities and towns. The percent change from the before to the after period (i.e., 2003 to 2005) is also reported in this table. It is important to note that these changes are in total reported crashes for these towns., 172866=\u03b1 (1994, rural, no business entrance), 186372=0.2540, 162687=0.1890, 186647=0.1921, 194629=0.1565, 154693=0.1056, 165710=0.2906, 156123=0.1121, 198793=0.1286, 139873=0.2194, 154372=0.1202, 195400=0.1764, 166042=0.1827, 161214=0.1110, 196360=-0.1661, 189439=0.2125, 179620=0.1560, 181984=0.1819, 10967=Table 3.

At several sites, more than one advance street name sign was installed per approach. The number of advance signs per intersection ranged from two to four signs, which were staggered to provide additional visual cues for drivers approaching the intersection. On average, the first signs are placed approximately 0.85 km (0.528 mi) prior to the intersection. Signs installed on interstates and ramps or signs that were installed outside the project period (before 1997 or after 2005) were removed from the database. To ensure these sites were installed at signalized intersections, this list was compared to a list of State-maintained signalized intersections provided by ADOT. Also contained in the signalized intersection database are the urban/rural designations of the intersections. Although there are several hundred intersections in this database, only signalized intersections with adequate traffic volume and intersection data were included in this study., 186298=0.2161, 12603=Table 21. Massachusetts fatal and injury crashes for treatment sites, 2002-2003, 73753=WisDOT provided electronic crash data from 1994\u00ad\u00ad to 2006 as well as the data dictionary. The crash data contained information on driver age, which was linked by crash number to identify when older drivers were involved in crashes., 157179=0.2500, 175827=0.1242, 195675=0.2415, 194007=0.1708, 193733=0.1900, 183106=0.1588, 186995=0.1929, 190511=0.1190, 149137=0.2377, 127411=Based on information from the Office of Management and Budget, a discount rate of 2.6 percent was used to determine the annual cost of the strategy.(13) This resulted in an annualized cost of $140 per sign for Arizona and $86 per sign for Massachusetts. Although the number of signs per intersection may vary, it was assumed that most intersections will have at least two signs (one for each approach of the major road), resulting in an annual cost per intersection of $280 for Arizona and $172 for Massachusetts. Consequently, a $560 and $344 annual crash savings is required per intersection to achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio in Arizona and Massachusetts, respectively., 144475=0.1450, 177486=-0.1721, 58819=For the years 2002 to 2006, the crash data files were significantly different than the data files for previous years. Crash data beginning with 2002 were derived from a new registry of motor vehicles (RMV) computer system called the Crash Data System (CDS). Entirely new forms were used to collect crash reports from police and operators., 62706=2003, 150567=0.2356, 639=5.

However, for specific crash types (i.e., sideswipe crashes) and at specific locations (i.e., along the major road at three-legged intersections, locations with a relatively large AADT, and locations with a relatively large expected number of crashes), this strategy has the potential to significantly reduce crashes. Based on conservative cost estimates, a reduction of just 0.01 crashes per intersection-year (i.e., one crash every 10 years per treated intersection) would achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio. Given the very low cost of this strategy and the potential to enhance way-finding, the use of advance street name signs is justified as a way-finding improvement, particularly at three-legged intersections as well as those locations with a relatively large AADT or a large expected number of crashes. From a safety standpoint, this strategy may not be justified as an effective measure to reduce total crashes, but it may be justified as an effective measure to reduce sideswipe crashes at or near signalized intersections., 145849=1994, 139524=-4.1570, 54963=Advance signs were installed on State-maintained roadways in Massachusetts as a statewide initiative in 2004. Districts were instructed to install the advance street name signs in a three-line format with the street name on the first two lines and \"NEXT SIGNAL\" on the third line on a 1.07-m (3.5-ft) by 0.91-m (3-ft) panel. If the intersecting street names were different on each side of the intersection, both street names were provided on the sign if space allowed or on separate panels, if necessary. The signs were placed on the right side of the street; however, if there was not sufficient space, they were placed in the median., 157437=0.2486, 54248=ADOT provided electronic AADT counts for each year from 1994 to 2006 and maintained comprehensive traffic data. Counts were available for all years in the before and after period for all treatment and reference locations. There was no need to estimate AADTs for any of the locations., 173386=0.1338, 140917=-0.1781, 166431=0.2241, 194081=0.2930, 194355=0.1699, 62982=2006, 57423=Massachusetts provided traffic counts from permanent count stations, periodic counts that occur every 2 to 3 years, and special counts that were project specific. There were limited traffic data available, which reduced the number of treatment and reference sites that could be included in the study. The Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD) conducted special counts for this study to supplement the existing data. Even with these special counts, annual traffic data were sparse for the major approach at most intersections. Therefore, an estimation process was used to compute major road AADT for years without AADT data. The first step in the process was to fit a model for the log of major road AADT within each district based on available traffic volume data for 1995-2006. The model included main effects for sites and a shared linear term for each year. Using this model, the major road AADT for 1999 was predicted for each site for which no reported value was available. A series of district-specific annual growth factors were then applied to the 1999 traffic volume counts to impute major road AADT for each site-year for which no reported value was available., 169696=0.2450, 188390=0.2020, 176875=0.1332, 195326=0.1855, 181013=0.1409, 174433=0.1285, 60556=2003, 186223=-0.2463, 2059=12.

For example, there was a 14-percent increase in total crashes between 2004 and 2005. The total crashes reported by year during the study period are reported in table 3. According to the MHD, this increase is explained primarily by the changes in data entry procedures at the RMV that resulted in a greater number of operator-only reports being entered in CDS, not necessarily due to an increase in the number of operator-only crashes or total crashes., 192614=0.1783, 163002=1.2487, 58681=Crash data were provided electronically for 2002 to 2006.

Massachusetts rear-end crashes for reference sites, 2002-2003, 139439=\u03b1 (1994, rural, undivided), 3881=Geometric, traffic, and crash data were obtained at signalized intersections for 82 sites in Arizona, 65 sites in Massachusetts, and 46 sites in Wisconsin. To account for potential selection bias and regression-to-the-mean, an Empirical Bayes before-after analysis was conducted to determine the safety effectiveness of installing advance street name signs. Based on the aggregate analysis, sideswipe crashes were the only crash type that changed significantly, which was a 27-percent reduction in Massachusetts and a 10-percent reduction for the three States combined. While results showed an insignificant reduction for total crashes in Massachusetts and Wisconsin, there was an insignificant increase in total crashes in Arizona. For the three States combined, there was a statistically insignificant reduction in total crashes (1.6 percent). The disaggregate analysis indicated that advance street name signs may be more effective on the major road at three-legged intersections as well as those locations with a relatively large average annual daily traffic (AADT) or a large expected number of crashes. Also, additional signs (i.e., two or more per approach) were shown to be more effective than just one advance sign. Based on conservative cost estimates, a reduction of just 0.01 crashes per intersection-year would achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio. Given the very low cost of this strategy and the potential to enhance way-finding, the use of advance street name signs is justified, particularly at three-legged intersections and locations with a relatively large AADT or a large expected number of crashes., 182756=0.1484, 183717=-0.2344, 198297=0.1232, 143764=0.1119, 175479=0.1290, 12718=Table 22. Massachusetts fatal and injury crashes for reference sites, 2002-2003, 128103=The most recent FHWA mean comprehensive cost per crash is $55,060 for an undefined collision based on 2001 dollar values.(8) Similarly, the costs for rear-end and sideswipe crashes at signalized intersections are $26,735 and $34,004, respectively. Comprehensive crash costs represent the present value, computed at a discount rate, of all costs over the victim's expected life span that result from a crash. The major categories of costs used in the calculation of comprehensive crash costs include medical-related costs, emergency services, property damage, lost productivity, and monetized quality-adjusted life years.(8) The value of an undefined crash is based on the comprehensive crash costs of various crash types and the proportion of each type of crash., 194703=0.1683, 186572=-0.1285, 176525=0.1275, 182480=0.2190, 190050=-0.1912, 60910=2005, 193311=0.1661, 63075=Percent Change From 2003 to 2005 (percent), 196821=0.1203, 155656=0.1840, 23549=Intersections account for a small portion of the total highway system; however, in 2006, approximately 2.42 million intersection-related crashes occurred. Intersection crashes accounted for 41 percent of all reported crashes and 21 percent (8,291) of all fatal crashes.(1) The disproportionately high percentage of intersection crashes is not surprising because intersections present more points of conflict than nonintersection locations. Crashes at signalized intersections represent about 51 percent (1.23 million) of all intersection-related crashes, of which 2,740 involved a fatality in 2006.(1), 146812=1997, 188042=0.2014, 167462=-5.1497, 195823=0.1880, 188316=0.1589, 187344=0.1994, 180317=0.1515, 128895=Based on the cost data from Arizona and assuming two signs per intersection (one on each major approach), a reduction of 0.010 crashes per intersection-year would achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio. If the advance street name signs are only intended to reduce target crash types (i.e., rear-end or sideswipe crashes), a greater reduction in crashes would be needed to achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio because target crash types are less costly. Based on Arizona cost data, a reduction of 0.020 rear-end crashes or 0.016 sideswipe crashes would achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio. Based on the cost data from Massachusetts, the corresponding reductions are 0.006 total, 0.013 rear-end, or 0.010 sideswipe crashes to achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio. If more than two signs are used per site, a greater reduction in crashes would be needed to achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio because the additional signs would increase costs., 189770=0.1029, 193659=0.1780, 173809=0.2100, 174084=0.1316, 28362=In 1997, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Standing Committee on Highway Traffic Safety, with the assistance of the FHWA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Committee on Transportation Safety Management, met with safety experts in the field of driver, vehicle, and highway issues from various organizations to develop a strategic plan for highway safety. These participants developed 22 key areas that affect highway safety. Two of these areas are older driver crashes and signalized intersection crashes., 168184=0.1998, 62798=2004}",
    "textBeforeTable": "STUDY DESIGN The study design involved a sample size analysis and prescription of needed data elements. The sample size analysis assessed the sample size required to statistically detect an expected change in safety and determined what changes in safety could be detected with likely available sample sizes. Sample Size Estimation Overview Sample size estimations required assumptions of the expected treatment effects and the average crash frequency at treatment sites in the before period. Minimum and desired sample sizes were calculated assuming a conventional before-after with reference group study design, as described in Hauer and a literature review of likely crash rates.(9) The sample size analysis undertaken for this study addressed the sample size required to statistically detect an expected change in safety. The sample size estimates were conservative because the EB methodology was incorporated in the before-after analysis rather than applied in a conventional before-after analysis with reference groups. Sample sizes were estimated for various assumptions of the likely annual crash frequency in the before period and likely safety effects of the advance street name signs. Annual crash frequencies were assumed for three crash types (total crashes, older driver crashes, and rear-end crashes), as shown in table 1. A crash frequency of 7.0 total crashes per intersection per year was assumed for urban signalized intersections based on summary statistics from Massachusetts and a variety of sources, including previous studies. SafetyAnalyst assumes that rear-end collisions represent 23 percent of total crashes and that crashes involving older",

It was necessary to identify a suitable reference group to be used in the EB procedure. As a general rule of thumb, 30 reference sites are required for each major category (e.g., rural/urban and three-legged/four-legged) within the strategy sites for each State. For example, if the strategy is implemented in both rural and urban areas at both three- and four-legged intersections, there are four major categories requiring 30 reference sites each (rural three-legged, rural four-legged, urban three-legged, and urban four-legged). If the strategy is only in rural areas, the number of categories would be reduced to just two major groups (rural three-legged and rural four-legged). Based on the study design, it was estimated that a maximum of 120 reference sites for each State would be needed for the EB analysis.
