The determination may be based at least in part on factors such as the amount of time since the last time dynamic presence information was captured, or the like. At 1810, a flag set based on the determination 1805 is made. If presence information should be captured, it is done at 1820. If presence information should not be captured, a normal response is issued at 1815., 168935=[0117] Turning now to FIG. 5, a detailed event sequence diagram that illustrates collecting and using dynamic presence information in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is presented. FIG. 5 provides more detail for FIG. 4. Mobile phone and 470 of FIG. 4 corresponds with mobile phone 500 of FIG. 5. Presence client SIM 505 of mobile phone 500 has previously registered for notification upon call connections on mobile phone 500. At 520, mobile phone 500 communicates the call connection event to presence client subscriber SIM 2005. At 525, presence client subscriber SIM 505 forms a SIP-like \u201cRegister\u201d request. At 530, presence client 505 uses SMS to send the \u201cRegister\u201d request to SMS-SIP gateway 510. At 535, SMS-SIP gateway 510 performs a phone number-to-SIP address lookup. At 540, the SMS-SIP gateway updates the presence attributes. At 545, the SMS-SIP gateway translates the SIP-like \u201cRegister\u201d request to a SIP request. At 550, the SMS-SIP gateway sends the SIP \u201cRegister\u201d request to presence agent 515. At 555, presence agent 515 retrieves the presence attributes associated with the originator of the \u201cRegister\u201d request. At 560, presence agent 515 updates the presence attributes with information from the \u201cRegister\u201d request. At 565, an event may be triggered based on the update. These updates are evaluated. If the result of the evaluation indicates notification is required, at 570, presence agent 590 is notified. Presence agent 590 responds with a \u201csuccess status\u201d at 575. At 580, presence agent 590 sends a \u201cNotify\u201d message to presence client 595. Presence client 595 responds with a success status at 585., 192036=[0143] Turning now to FIG. 17, a flow diagram that illustrates an event-driven method for triggering dynamic presence information collection in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is presented. At 1700, an envelope command corresponding to a registered event download trigger is received. At 1705, a determination is made regarding whether presence information should be captured. The determination may be based at least in part on factors such as the amount of time since the last time dynamic presence information was captured, or the like. At 1710, a flag set based on the determination 1705 is examined. If presence information should be captured, it is done at 1720. If presence information should not be captured, a normal response is issued at 1715., 188304=[0138] Turning now to FIG. 14A, an event sequence diagram that illustrates a status command from a mobile phone that is not followed by a proactive SIM request is presented. At 1404, the ME 1402 issues a status command. At 1406, the SIM 1400 responds with normal data on dynamic presence and a status code of \u201890\u2019, indicating there is nothing more for the ME 1402 to do., 194172=[0146] Turning now to FIG. 19, a flow diagram that illustrates a method for proactive congestion control in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is presented. At 1900, an exponent is set to a starting threshold. At 1905, a measurement of the end-to-end PSA streaming rate and a current measurement of the available bandwidth are passed through a low pass filter. At 1910, a determination is made regarding whether the filtered PSA streaming rate is greater than the filtered bandwidth value. If the filtered PSA streaming rate is not greater than the filtered bandwidth value, the exponent is set to the starting threshold at 1900 and the process continues at 1905. If the filtered PSA streaming rate is greater than the filtered bandwidth value, at 1915 a delay is performed. The delay period is based on the value 2exponent. At 1920, the value of the exponent is increased. At 1925, the next SIP over SMS packet is sent. The process continues at 1905., 186276=[0136] Turning now to FIG. 13A, an event sequence diagram that illustrates using a proactive SIM request for dynamic presence data responsive to a normal command from a mobile phone in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is presented. At 1304, the ME 1302 issues a normal command. At 1306, the SIM 1300 responds with a status code of \u201891\u2019, indicating the ME 1302 should request information from the SIM 1300. At 1308, the ME 1302 issues a \u201cFetch\u201d command to the SIM 1300. At 1310, the SIM 1300 responds with a proactive SIM command that may include a request for presence information. At 1316, the ME 1302 performs the proactive SIM command. At 1312, the ME 1302 provides a successful response.
