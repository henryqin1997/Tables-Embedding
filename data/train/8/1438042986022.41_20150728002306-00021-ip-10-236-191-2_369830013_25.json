Release 4.2.0 This command was supported in the dynamic template configuration mode for BNG. Usage Guidelines To use this command, you must be in a user group associated with a task group that includes appropriate task IDs. If the user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for assistance. When you enable CHAP or PAP authentication (or both), the local router requires the remote device to prove its identity before allowing data traffic to flow. PAP authentication requires the remote device to send a name and a password, which is checked against a matching entry in the local username database or in the remote security server database. CHAP authentication sends a challenge message to the remote device. The remote device encrypts the challenge",
