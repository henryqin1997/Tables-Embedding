I am going to be a senior this coming 2012-2013 school year and I have lived on campus for 3 years. You meet so many great people living on campus and I can say that I have found friends that I will keep in touch with after we all graduate. Living on campus is also convenient, because the dorms are connected to the whole campus either by hall ways or underground tunnels so you don't have to go outside if you don't want to. Its a little easier to get to classes and easier to get to on campus activities that go on during the school year., 44518=Concordia has great food and food choices. We have our cafeteria which is a buffet style with a salad bar and an ice cream bar (similar to cold stone creamery). We are currently building a student union for the 2012-2013 academic school year where we will have more choices of food similar to a food court style.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Concordia is a place many people enjoy being at. While you are very sheltered at this school, students can feel safe and really focus on school and their career paths. I feel that by going to other schools, I would not be as focused as I am here. Also, the classes are small allowing the proffessors to know the students on more of a personal level. There are also a lot of opportunities for the students to transform Concordia into anything they want it to be. Am learning a lot Concordia University is known for having one of the top Athletic Training Education Programs in the country. In my first semester as a freshman I have already begun to learn a lot about my major and have begun practicing skills that are necessary for athletic training. Not only have I grown in my knowledge but Concordia also strives in helping its students to grow in their knowledge of the bible and Jesus. I have also gained additional knowledge in this way.
