Sparged glacial acetic acid (0.060 g, 0.001 mol) was added through a Teflon septa and the solutions were heated to 90\ufffd C. for about 18 hours in an oil bath. The contents of each vial was allowed to cool to room temperature and 2 g of THF added. A sample of the contents was removed to determine the molecular weights, then the solutions were added to excess n-heptane to cause precipitation, the solids collected and dried overnight at 90\ufffd C. in a vacuum oven and weighed. Yield, molecular weights, polydispersity, CA and SA for each polymer is shown in Table M., 294608=38 g of the initial polymer was obtained and after reprecipitation using an excess of 85:15 MeOH/water, 35 g of the polymer (50% isolated yield) was obtained., 296959=To a glass reactor equipped with stirring, TFSNB (36.7 g, 0.144 mol), NBHFAEsNB (13.3 g, 0.036 mol), toluene (56.0 g), and ethyl acetate (19.0 g) were added. The mixture was sparged and then the reactor was placed in a dry box, after which solid DANFABA (0.481 g, 0.0006 mol), Pd-1206 (0.145 g, 0.00012 mol) and triethylsilane (1.465 g, 0.0126 mol) were added to the reactor. The reactor was then removed from the dry box and sparged glacial acetic acid (0.216 g, 0.0036 mol) added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was then heated to 100\ufffd C. for 18 hours with stirring. After allowing the mixture to cool to room temperature, it was subjected to purification to remove residual monomer and catalyst. Mw, Mn, and PDI were determined to be 5382, 3544, and 1.39, respectively. The polymer composition was found to be 84/14/2 (TFSNB/NBHFAEsNB/Acid NB) where as previously mentioned the Acid NB is derived from the acid dissociable monomer during purification of the polymer. From a film of the polymer cast onto a substrate. CA and SA were determined to be 80\ufffd and 25\ufffd, respectively. The dissolution rate in 0.26 N aqueous TMAH was found to be 1601 nm/sec., 183961=The variables for these examples P4 and P5 are shown in Table C. In example P4, secPrHFAEsNB monomer and anhydrous toluene (30 mL) were mixed in a 100 mL crimp-cap vial, nitrogen purged for 10 minutes and sealed. The vial was moved to a dry box, unsealed and Pd-1394, LiFABA and triethyl silane were added and the vial resealed. Glacial acetic acid was then added by syringe. The reaction mixture was heated for about 23 hours at 90\ufffd C. in an oil bath to obtain a clear yellow liquid. After purification to remove residual monomer and catalyst, the reaction mixture was precipitated using hexanes and dried under vacuum at 90\ufffd C., 193129=The variables for examples P6, P7, and P8 are shown in Table D. For P6 and P7, TFSNB, HFANB, toluene, and ethyl acetate were added to a glass reactor with stirring and sparged and moved to the dry box. For example P8 TFSNB, HFANB, toluene and ethyl acetate were added in the dry box. Solid DANFABA, Pd-1206 and triethylsilane were added to the reactor and the reactor sealed and removed from the dry box. Sparged glacial acetic acid was added to the reaction mixture, after which it was to 100\ufffd C., with stirring, for the length of time shown in Table D. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. Total solids determination of the reaction mixture indicated that essentially 100% conversion of monomer had occurred. The reaction mixture was purified to remove residual monomer and catalyst. For P8, purification included precipitation of the polymer from hexane, which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum at 90\ufffd C. The analytical data obtained is shown in the table., 299376=In a dry box, TFSsecPrNB (10.0 g, 0.0353 mol), triethylsilane (0.286 g, 0.00247 mol), toluene (12 g), ethyl acetate (4 g), Pd-1206 (0.043 g, 0.000035 mol), and DANFABA (0.084 g, 0.000105 mol) are added to a glass reactor equipped with stirring. The reaction mixture is sparged then the reactor capped and brought out of the dry box. Sparged glacial acetic acid (0.094 g, 0.00157 mol) is added and the reaction mixture is heated to 100\ufffd C. for 15-20 hours and allowed to cool to room temperature. After purification to remove residual monomers and catalyst, the polymer is precipitated by adding the reaction mixture to excess hexane. After collection and drying, the solids are the target polymer., 292078=1H-NMR analysis of the final product did not indicate the presence of residual monomer and the 13C NMR analysis revealed a composition of approximately 35/31/30/4 of ECHNB/TFENB/TFSNB/Acid NB. Mw, Mn, and PDI were determined to be 4300, 2600 and 1.66, respectively. A thin film (about 1 micron) of this polymer, spun on silicon wafer from a 20% solution in PGMEA, had a CA of 77\ufffd\ufffd2\ufffd., 108612=In accordance with some multi-component catalyst embodiments of the present invention, monomer to catalyst to cocatalyst molar ratios can range from about 500:1:5 to about 20,000:1:5 or from 500:1:1 to 20,000:1:1. In some such embodiments, molar ratios are from about 5,000:1:4 to about 1,000:1:2, and in still other such embodiments, molar ratios of from about 3,000:1:3 to about 1,000:1:2 are advantageous. It should be recognized that appropriate molar ratios can and will vary depending, among other things, on the activity of a particular catalyst system, the reactivity of the monomer selected, and molecular weight of the resulting polymer that is desired. In addition, for embodiments of the present invention where single component catalysts are employed, the addition of a cocatalyst can be eliminated. However, generally a ratio of from about 5,000:1:4 to about 5000:1:2, and in particular of about 2000:1:3 to about 1000:1:3 have been found useful., 294799=1H-NMR of the final product did not indicate the presence of residual monomer and the 13C NMR analysis revealed a composition of approximately 35/32/29/4 of ECHNB/TFENB/TFSNBB/Acid NB. Mw, Mn and PDI were determined to be 12453, 6043 and 2.06, respectively. A thin film (about 1 micron) of this polymer, spun on a silicon wafer from a 20% solution in PGMEA, had a CA of 75\ufffd\ufffd2\ufffd., 311683=The number of defects on the thus-obtained line-and-space pattern (1:1) having a pitch of 130 nm was counted with KLA2351 (by KLA Tencor Co., Ltd.), and it decreased to 0.5% of the number thereof in a control sample not having a protective film formed thereon., 128235=In some photoresist composition embodiments, a mixed solvent containing at least one of propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) and ethyl lactate (EL), together with \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL) as the organic solvent has been found advantageous. In such a case, the mass ratio of the former and latter components of such a mixed solvent is from about 70:30 to about 95:5. Where both PGMEA and EL are employed, a mass ratio of from 50:50 to about 90:10 is useful., 234839=The variables for examples P18, P19, and P20 are shown in Table H below. To a glass reactor equipped with stirring; TFSNB, toluene, ethyl acetate and one of NBXOCH3, NBCH2OCH2CH2OCH3, or NBCOOCH2CH2OH were added. The mixture was sparged with nitrogen for 10 min and moved to a dry box in which solid DANFABA, Pd-1206 and triethylsilane were added to the reactor, the reactor sealed and removed from the dry box. Glacial acetic acid, sparged with nitrogen, was then added and the mixture heated to 100\ufffd C. for the length of time shown in the table, after which it was allowed to cool to room temperature. For P18, THF (2 g) and toluene (4.5 g) were added to the reaction mixture, and then this was poured into hexanes (200 g) to cause precipitation. The precipitate was collected and then dried in a vacuum oven at 90\ufffd C. The analytical data obtained is shown in the table., 171213=Portions of this synthesis were modified from the original literature report: Kas'yan, et al. in Russian Journal of Organic Chemistry 2002, 38(1), 29-35. Sodium hydroxide (29.5 g, 0.738 mol) was dissolved in deionized water (75 g) and cooled in an ice bath. Norbornene carboxaldehyde (50.0 g, 0.410 mol), nitroethane (32.3 g, 0.431 mol) and methanol (300 mL) placed in a 1 L 3-neck round bottomed flask and cooled in an ice water/salt bath to about \u22125 C to \u221210\ufffd C.). The cold sodium hydroxide solution was added to this flask drop wise while keeping the temperature below \u22125\ufffd C. The solution was brought to room temperature in 2 hours and the stirring continued for 15 hours at room temperature. The white solid mass formed was partially dissolved in cold water (500 mL). This suspension was added to 20% hydrochloric acid solution (600 mL) and extracted with methylene chloride (2\ufffd300 mL). The methylene chloride extract was washed with brine solution (2\ufffd250 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The reduced pressure distillation of the crude product yielded the target compound (NBCH\u2550C(CH3)NO2) in 47% yield., 290805=To the solution in the reaction vessel, Pd-1394 (1.394 g, 0.001 mol), Li FABA (2.613 g, 0.003 mol), and triethylsilane (1.16 g, 0.01 mol) were added, and the solution was mixed. Glacial acetic acid (0.30 g, 0.005 mol) was added to the solution in the reaction vessel and the solution was heated to 90\ufffd C. overnight., 329454=When the L/S pattern for each example was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the line and space at 65 nm yielded a 1:1 resist pattern. Further, regarding the form of the resist pattern, the lines showed no waviness and little roughness., 245610=The variables for examples P21, P22 and P23 are shown in Table J below. For P21 and P22, TFSNB, the appropriate monomer, toluene, and ethyl acetate were added to a glass reactor equipped with stirring, the mixture was sparged and placed in a dry box. For P22, TFSNB, PPVENB, toluene and ethyl acetate were added to a glass reactor placed in a dry box. To the reactor in the dry box; solid DANFABA, Pd-1206 and triethylsilane were added, the reactor sealed and taken out of the dry box. Sparged glacial acetic acid was added and the mixture heated to 100\ufffd C. for the length of time shown in the table. The reaction mixture was then allowed to cool to room temperature. For P21 and P22, THF (2 g) was added to the reaction mixture, and then the reaction mixture was poured into hexanes (200 g) to cause precipitation. For P23, the undiluted reaction mixture was added to hexane to cause precipitation. The TFSNB to PPVENB ratio was found to be 84 to 16 and the OD of the polymer was 0.14 \u03bc\u22121. The precipitates or all the reactions were collected and dried in a vacuum oven at 90\ufffd C. The analytical data obtained for the polymers is shown in the table below., 295966=After treatment to remove catalyst residue from the polymer, the resulting solution was concentrated using a rotary evaporator and the polymer product was precipitated with an excess of 85:15 MeOH/water. The colorless solid polymer obtained (67 g) was dried overnight at 90\ufffd C. in a vacuum oven, dissolved in toluene and precipitated with an excess of hexane. The polymer was dried overnight at 90\ufffd C. in a vacuum oven to obtain 62 g of the polymer (43% isolated yield)., 127076=Exemplary solvents are generally organic solvents that include ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, methyl isoamyl ketone and 2-heptanone; polyhydric alcohols and derivatives thereof, such as ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monoacetate, diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol, propylene glycol monoacetate, dipropylene glycol, or the monomethyl ether, monoethyl ether, monopropyl ether, monobutyl ether or monophenyl ether of dipropylene glycol monoacetate; cyclic ethers such as dioxane; and esters such as methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, methylpyruvate, ethyl pyruvate, methyl methoxypropionate, and ethyl ethoxypropionate. As mentioned above, the exemplary solvents can be used singularly, or as a mixed solvent having two or more different, individual solvents. Where mixed solvents are employed, mixed solvents of propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate and a lactate ester have been found to be advantageous in general and specifically where a mixture ratio of from about 8:2 to 2:8 (by mass), respectively is employed., 329066=The substrates were then subjected to a post exposure bake (PEB) at 100\ufffd C. for 90 seconds, and put through puddle development for 60 seconds in 2.38 wt % aqueous tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) at 23\ufffd C., followed by rinsing in pure water for 30 seconds, after which they were spin-dried, obtaining 1:1 for the resist pattern (\u201cL/S pattern\u201d below)., 328591=Next, using a LEIES 193-1 two-beam interferometer (manufactured by Nikon) for immersion exposure, immersion two-beam interferometer exposure was performed using a prism, water, and two 193 nm interferometers. This method has been reported in the Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B (US) (19:6 2001, p. 2353-2356) and is publicly known as a method usable in research labs for obtaining line and space (L&S) patterns., 213212=The variables for examples P12, P13, and P14 are shown in Table F. For P13 and P14, a glass reactor equipped with stirring was placed in a dry box and TFSNB, toluene, ethyl acetate and one of C9BrAcNB or C10BrAcNB were added. For P12, TFSNB, secPrHFAEsNB, toluene and ethyl acetate were added to a glass reactor, the mixture sparged, and then placed in a dry box. For each of P 12, P 13 and P 14, DANFABA, Pd-1206 and triethylsilane were added to the reactor, the reactor sealed and removed from the dry box. Sparged glacial acetic acid was then added and the mixture heated to 100\ufffd C., with stirring, for the length of time shown in the table after which it was allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction mixture was purified to remove residual monomer and catalyst. For P13 the reaction mixture was added to heptane and in P14 to hexane, the resulting precipitate collected and dried. The analytical data obtained is shown in the table., 273281=To each solution, Pd-1394 (0.070 g, 0.00005 mol), Li FABA (0.131 g, 0.00015 mol), and triethylsilane (0.116 g, 0.001 mol) were added, and the vials resealed and taken out of the dry box. Sparged glacial acetic acid (0.060 g, 0.001 mol) was added to each solution through a Teflon septa and the solutions were heated to 90\ufffd C. for 18 hours in an oil bath. The contents were allowed to cool to room temperature and 2 g of THF added to each vial. A sample of each vial was removed to determine the molecular weights and polydispersities shown in Table N. After which the solutions were added to excess n-heptane to cause precipitation, the solids collected and dried overnight at 90\ufffd C. in a vacuum oven. The CA's and SA's of thin films of each polymer on a bare silicon wafer were measured and the data obtained shown in Table N., 111762=In top-coat polymer embodiments of the invention, a desired average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymers is from about 3000 to about 200,000. In other embodiments, Mw is from about 3500 to about 50,000 and in still other embodiments from about 4000 to 10,000. In photoresist polymer embodiments of the invention, a desired Mw of the polymers is from about 2000 to about 50,000. In other embodiments, Mw is from about 2500 to about 35,000 and in still other embodiments from about 3000 to 10000. However, it should be understood that other embodiments in accordance with the present invention encompass top-coat and photoresist polymers having other average molecular weight ranges, and that such polymers can have either a higher or lower Mw that is provided with the exemplary Mw ranges above. Thus such other Mw ranges will be understood to be within the scope and spirit of the present invention. Further to the Mw ranges provided above, it will be noted that Mw for any polymer referred to herein is measured using gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) with an appropriate standard, unless otherwise noted., 291552=After treatment to remove catalyst residue from the polymer, the resulting solution was concentrated using a rotary evaporator and the polymer product was precipitated with an excess of hexane. The colorless solid polymer obtained (26 g) was dried overnight at 90\ufffd C. in a vacuum oven, dissolved in 1:1 THF/MeOH mixture (60 mL) and precipitated with an excess of 90:10 MeOH/water. The polymer was dried overnight at 90\ufffd C. in a vacuum oven to obtain 23.3 g of the polymer (38% isolated yield)., 332464=It should be realized that by and through the examples, data and discussion thereof has been provided that demonstrate that embodiments of top coat polymers, top coat (protective film-forming) materials formed using such polymers, top coat layers formed thereof and processes for using such layers provide solutions to the aforementioned problems found with previously known materials. Such top coat materials and layers formed thereof provide alkali solubility, resistance to an immersion fluid, low solubility to and with photoresist layer components, good protection against leaching from and/or to such photoresist layer and good protection as gas-barrier layer and low optical densities. In addition, top coat materials and layers formed thereof provide, during an immersion lithographic process, excellent scanability and reduced defectivity as compared to a process where such a top coat layer is not used. Further, such layers demonstrate high contact and receding angles and a low sliding angle which are believed desirable for such performance. Also, it should be realized that the examples provided herein are not limiting, but rather exemplary of what might be obtained through a process of polymer design. For example a film was formed from a 4 wt % solution of a non-self imageable polymer of TFSNB and NBXOH (97:3) in isobutanol a found to have a CA of 70\ufffd, a SA of 22\ufffd, a dissolution rate (DR) of 1710 nm/sec and a waterproofness of \u22122%. Also, films formed from 4 wt % solutions of the non-self imageable polymers TFSNB and NBHFAEsNB (90:10) and TFSNB and NBHFAEsNB(80:20) in isobutanol were found to have CAs of 70\ufffd and 71\ufffd, SAs of 23\ufffd and 21\ufffd, DRs of 1937 nm/sec and 1654 nm/sec and waterproofness of \u22120.2% and \u22120.1%, respectively. Like the non-self imageable disclosed in Examples TC5a-f, this polymer also exhibited advantageous results after both the wet and dry exposure imaging tests described for such examples., 295631=To the solution in the reaction vessel, Pd-1394 (0.8364 g, 0.00060 mol), Li FABA (1.5684 g, 0.0018 mol), and triethylsilane (2.91 g, 0.025 mol) were added, and the solution was stirred. Glacial acetic acid (0.72 g, 0.012 mol) was added to the solution, after which it was heated to 90\ufffd C. for 40 hours., 184623=In example P5, TFSCH2NB, toluene, and ethyl acetate were added to a glass reactor equipped with stirring. The mixture was sparged and then placed into a dry box and solid DANFABA, Pd-1206 and triethylsilane added. The reactor was taken out of the dry box and sparged glacial acetic acid added. The mixture was heated to 100\ufffd C. for 17.5 hours then allowed to cool to room temperature, after which it was purified to remove residual monomer and catalyst. The analytical data obtained is shown in the table below., 296469=1H-NMR of the final product did not indicate the presence of residual monomer and the 13C NMR analysis revealed a composition of approximately 46/40/9/5 of ECHNB/TFENB/HFANB/Acid NB. Mw, Mn, and PDI were determined to be 4116, 2478, and 1.66, respectively., 330084=When the L/S pattern obtained using the alternative composition by the same exposure method was observed using the SEM, the line and space for 65 nm formed a resist pattern of 1:1. However, the form of the resist pattern showed remarkable unevenness and much roughness in the lines., 159279=Norbornene ethylamine (NBCH2CH2NH2) was obtained by first reacting 5-norbornene-2-carboxaldehyde (NBC(O)H) with nitromethane in the presence of sodium hydroxide in methanol followed by selective reduction of the nitroethyl pendent group with lithium aluminum hydride. This synthesis had being reported by Kas'yan et al, in Russ. J. Org. Chem. 2002, 38(1), 29-35. Norbornene ethylamine was reacted with trifluoromethane sulfonic anhydride in the presence of triethylamine to form the target monomer, TFSCH2NB., 298290=TFSNB (44.9 g, 0.176 mol), ethanol (0.811 g, 0.0176 mol), anhydrous toluene (72 mL), and propyleneglycol methylether (8 mL) were mixed in a 250 mL crimp-cap bottle containing a stirrer bar, sparged and then the bottle sealed. The bottle was brought into a dry box, unsealed and Pd-1206 (849 g, 0.0007 mol), DANFABA (1.69 g, 0.0021 mol), and triethylsilane (1.23 g, 0.0106 mol) were added. The bottle was re-sealed and the contents heated to 80\ufffd C., with stirring, in an oil bath for 21 hours. After the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, THF (10 g) was added. After treatment to remove catalyst and monomer residues from the resulting solution, it was concentrated using a rotary evaporator and the polymer product was precipitated with an excess of hexane to yield, after collection and drying in a vacuum oven at 90\ufffd C., 26 g of the homopolymer (58%). Mw, Mn, and PDI were determined to be 5580, 3810 and 1.47, respectively., 173082=The variables for these examples are shown in Table B. To a glass reactor equipped with stirring, TFSNB toluene; ethyl acetate; and one of HFANB, FPCNB, or C8AcNB; were added. The mixture was sparged and placed in the dry box where solid DANFABA and triethylsilane were added. The reactor was taken out of the dry box and sparged glacial acetic acid, was added. The mixture was then heated to 100\ufffd C. after which Pd-1206 in ethyl acetate was added. The mixture was maintained at 100\ufffd C. with stirring for the length of time indicated and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The amount of total solids indicated that essentially 100% conversion of monomers had occurred. Each reaction mixture was purified to remove residual monomer and catalyst. The analytical data obtained is shown in the table below., 256701=The vials were unsealed and Pd-1394 (0.070 g, 0.00005 mol), Li FABA (0.131 g, 0.00015 mol) and triethylsilane (0.116 g, 0.001 mol) were added to each. The vials were then re-sealed and removed from the dry box where glacial acetic acid (0.060 g, 0.001 mol), sparged with nitrogen, was added to each solution through the teflon septa and the solutions were heated to 90\ufffd C. for 18 hours in an oil bath. The contents of the vials were then allowed to cool to room temperature and 2 g of THF added to each. The polymer solutions were then added to excess n-heptane to cause precipitation. Solid polymer was collected and dried overnight at 90\ufffd C. in a vacuum oven. Yield, molecular weights, polydispersity, CA and SA for each polymer is shown in Table K., 48870=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.
