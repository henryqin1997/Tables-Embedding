We attribute this increase, in part, to the decision to use the Departmental tracking system as the sole source of data for FOIA reporting.

The OIS is the focal point for the coordination of FOIA program improvement efforts at DOL. OIS provides agency-wide oversight, leadership and guidance to ensure compliance with FOIA, particularly to increase the quality, and timeliness of FOIA responses; reduce the backlog of pending FOIA requests; and review the effectiveness of each agency's FOIA processes in order to benchmark best practices, and make recommendations for programmatic improvements.

No. 98-78, 91 Stat. 319, 341634=05-11-10, 5537=One of the initiatives advanced by OIS is the consistent use of the Department's centralized FOIA tracking database, the Secretary's Information Management System for FOIA or \"SIMS-FOIA.\" DOL component agencies have utilized SIMS-FOIA in their FOIA processing to an increasing degree in the years since the database's launch in FY 2006. The system assigns a unique SIMS-FOIA number to each logged request. As part of the logging process, users enter information describing the request and various processing milestones that are required in this report. In past years, DOL agency components have used both SIMS-FOIA and other manual or automated tracking methodologies in the preparation of the annual FOIA report. However, with this report, for the first time DOL is using SIMS-FOIA as the sole source of data for its FOIA reporting requirements. Because the agency is not relying on manual or other tracking systems, there are some discrepancies between the data in this report and in the data reported in FY 2010. This report incorporates footnotes and other explanatory information to reconcile those differences., 343341=02-11-11, 360082=01-13-09, 335450=09-23-09, 344344=06-15-11, 345696=10-26-10, 335682=04-01-09, 361405=1170, 367124=1039.0, 356729=01-10-11, 344114=07-14-11, 9923=1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of the Secretary (OSEC), (202) 693-7277. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of the Solicitor (SOL), (202) 693-5391. 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of Administrative Law Judges (ALJ), 800 K Street, N.W., Suite N-400, Washington, D.C. 20001-8002, (202) 693-7440. 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management (OASAM), (202) 693-7277. 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy (OASP), (202) 693-5925. 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), (202) 693-6806. 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs (OCIA), (202) 693-4630. 8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP), (202) 693-4930. 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), (202) 693-1145. 10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of Inspector General (OIG), (202) 693-5113. 11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of Labor Management Standards (OLMS), (202) 693-0123. 12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of Public Affairs (OPA), (202) 693-4654. 13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), (202) 693-0934. 14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB), (202) 693-4770. 15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Postal Square Building, Room 4040, 2 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20212-0001, (202) 691-7628. 16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Employment and Training Administration (ETA), (202) 693-3140. 17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Job Corps (part of ETA), 1-800-733-JOBS. 18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), 1100 Wilson Boulevard, 21st Floor, Arlington, Virginia 22209, (202) 693-9424. 19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), (202) 693-1897. 20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA), (202) 693-8655. 21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS), (202) 693-4745. 22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Employees' Compensation Appeals Board (ECAB), (202) 693-5028. 23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Administrative Review Board (ARB), (202) 693-5028. 24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Benefits Review Board (BRB), (202) 693-5028. 25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wage and Hour Division (WHD), (202) 693-0388. 26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Women's Bureau (WB), (202) 693-6735., 12973=U.S. Department of Labor 201 Varick Street New York, New York 10014 (212) 337-2215 (For Wage and Hour Division only: Contact Region III), 421564=03-22-11, 361116=08-13-07, 421261=08-01-11, 348971=12-02-09, 15158=U.S. Department of Labor 1999 Broadway Denver, Colorado 80202 (303) 844-1700 (For Wage and Hour Division and OFCCP: Contact Region VI), 342098=8-13-07, 336378=12-29-08, 348161=07-11-11, 345465=05-11-11, 403125=08-01-11, 347619=09-15-11, 7032=A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For questions concerning this report, please contact Ramona Branch Oliver, Director, Office of Information Services (OIS), Office of the Solicitor, Room N-2420, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210, telephone number (202) 693-5391, fax number 202-693-5389., 446515=[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistent usage of the Departmental FOIA tracking system has allowed for more accurate reporting of the agency's FOIA activities, and has resulted in the identification of requests that may have been miscalculated in last year's FOIA report.
