It also leases pipeline capacity to others. The company drills for and produces oil and gas, extracts and sells natural gas liquids, and is engaged in the gas marketing business. Public utilities include natural gas, electricity, water, and telephone systems. Many utility companies will diversify themselves into many categories, but these firms below have, for the most part, not done that. Most of the companies here are specialized in the sales of natural gas. Those that are vertically integrated have a more stable foundation over those that only market their gas, as they are involved directly in the production and distribution of their product. Revenue is heavily dependent on weather conditions (colder weather causes gas sales to rise as people heat their homes) and population growth. \u00a0 ONEOK Inc. vs Gas Utilities",
