    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{109012=In 1840 Thiers made a treaty with Holland which, in spite of opposition from the seaports, lasted till 1860. Formidable opposition compelled Guizot to abandon a projected commercial treaty with England. Louis Philippe had an idea of opposing the German Zollverein, definitely constituted in 1833, by a Customs union with Belgium, but the sole outcome was the treaty of 1842, established for four years. When Guizot proposed a treaty with Piedmont, even on a four years\u2019 basis, he had to demand a vote of confidence. The Free Trade Association, with the Duc d\u2019Harcourt as its president and Frederic Bastiat as general secretary, did not aim at complete Free Trade, but the substitution for prohibition of a 20 per cent. duty; a 91/2d. duty on corn instead of the sliding scale; the 1816 tariff of 2s. 7d. per head on oxen; repeal of the duties on coal and pig-iron; steel to be brought under the imperial tariff at 79s. per ton; abolition of duties on some hundreds of minor articles only bringing in an insignificant Edition: current; Page: [21] return, of zones and classes and all right of exportation. They did not demand immediate repeal, but gradual reduction of duties on raw material, e.g., raw cotton, fleeces, hemp, flax, iron and steel bars, and dyestuffs., 176200=And to reach this result the State paid between 1893-1902 in, 407414=In 1901 the Board of Trade commissioned Sir Edition: current; Page: [158] Alfred Bateman to issue a Memorandum on the Comparative Statistics on Population, Industry, and Commerce in the United Kingdom and some leading foreign countries. The American having succeeded the German bogey in 1902, a fresh Memorandum was issued for the United States. As early as 1896 Mr. Chamberlain had proposed an Imperial Customs Union: on June 30, 1902, the Colonial Premiers took part in a Colonial Conference, where Mr. Chamberlain declared that he wished to establish Free Trade within the Empire, while recognising the special needs of new countries; and he drew attention to Canada\u2019s offer of preferential treatment to English goods., 140327=It is true that the rise in imports was greater in proportion than the rise in exports; but the latter had kept up even after deducting the exceptional years after the war, 1872 to 1875., 725929=The metal factories wanted to shake off the tyranny of the Mining Cartel: those who were able worked their own mines, and the output from the non-Syndicate mines grew steadily\u201411,900,000 tons in 1899, it was 12,600,000 in 1900 and 13,100,000 in 1901. Meanwhile, the factories that were subject to the Cartel found themselves at a disadvantage compared to those which provided their own raw material. The heads of the Cartel had, of course, taken care to repeat that they must be distinguished from a Trust, that they would not destroy moderate or small producer; Edition: current; Page: [274] of course the exact reverse is the case. In the Ruhr basin the Coal Syndicate had one competitor, the State coal mines. It carried the subordination of the metal industry to such a pitch that a high-power furnace could only be worked in conjunction with its own coal mine. Having crushed a combined steel factory and rolling mill, they established the principle that every establishment must contain in itself blast furnace and steel manufactory. This is the effect of the trust tyranny, confusing industry instead of specialising it according to the law of the division of labour. Thus, out of nineteen independent businesses at Rote Erde coal mines\u2014blast furnaces and iron mines\u2014sixteen have been absorbed by three companies, Gelsenkirchen, Schalke, and Aachener Hutten., 722157=The panegyrists of the German Cartels would lead one to suppose that they worked in perfect harmony without the slightest friction; as a matter of fact, some of the Cartels tyrannised over those which used their raw materials. In 1899, for example, the Rehmschied canal builders bought sheet-iron at the Essen dock for 200s. per ton, which was sold to a Dutch timber-yard for 180s., and the Manchester cutlers got their iron cheaper than those in Solingen. The Rheinish-Westphalian Cartel sold iron at home for 95s. which they sold abroad for 80s., and 72s. in September, 1902. The English Edition: current; Page: [272] and Belgian rolling mills fixed their selling price in relation to the lowest cost at which they could get German iron; and the German rolling mills, which exported 60 per cent. of their output, had to sell abroad at this price, although they paid 18 and 20 per cent. more for their raw materials. A Cartel which sells semi-manufactured goods with a bounty to foreigners is robbing the industry of its own country of these goods, and especially in giving labour in proportion to the degree of finish of the product. Far from protecting \u201cnational labour,\u201d Cartels give work to foreign workmen., 236211=The export of clothes and underclothes stands ninth in the total of French exports. The following are the figures reckoned on an annual average over the three years preceding the 1892 tariff:\u2014, 724571=In September, 1904, the Association for the Defence Edition: current; Page: [273] of Steel Consumers protested against the action of the Syndicate in selling them couplings at 5s. 6d. and plates at 4s. above the selling price in England, and demanded the reduction of the price of partly manufactured steel to 5s. As ground for their refusal the Syndicate alleged the 15s. bounty., 99672=The Commission raised the duty on cast steel from 40s. to 48s. per cwt., and that on sheet iron and wire to 56s. per cwt. The discussion of the Bill showed the enormous profits of the ironmasters. In 1790 they sold their iron profitably at 12s. 10d. per cwt.; in 1822 they declared the price must be 20s. per cwt., a figure which represented an excess of \u00a31,200,000 on the production of 1825. The 1822 tariff was maintained without increase. Under a pretext of giving drawbacks, bounties were granted; they were given on woollen threads and textiles so as to maintain for the benefit of the manufactures the profit assured by protection to wool., 215099=A duty of 1s. 3d. was imposed in the following year, when the state of agriculture had proved it unnecessary; in 1887 a duty of 2s., and in 1904 one of 2s. 10d. The harvest of 1882 was not equalled till 1894; that of 1874 in 1898 and 1899, when it was 352,000,000 bushels. The last great harvest was that of 1902 with 341,000,000 bushels., 512200=The Reports of the Committee appointed in 1900 to inquire into the production and consumption of meat and milk in the United Kingdom by the Royal Statistical Society, give the following results, estimated on the five years ending May 31, 1903:\u2014, 835957=Copyright \u00a92004 - 2015 Liberty Fund, Inc. All rights reserved., 711922=Nevertheless a great deal has been made of the industrial development of Germany, and although her imports exceed her exports, those who weigh the balance of commerce are never tired of admiring the increase at each end of the scale; they even go as far as to compare the trade of Germany in 1870 with that of 1904, although since the German Empire only came into existence in 1871 any calculations up to 1880 are quite worthless. Hamburg and Bremen did not enter the Imperial Customs Union (Zollverein) till 1888. Customs statistics before 1888 cannot be compared with that of to-day; those who undertake such a comparison may obtain some very striking percentages, but all their conclusions are nullified by their mistaken premises. Glancing over the statistics for German imports and exports since 1889, we find:\u2014, 237901=That is, during the period following the 1892 tariff there was a fall, relative to the preceding period, of 18 per cent., and even in the second period a fall of 10 per cent.; that the excess of the average of the three years 1900-02 over the average of 1889-91 was not due to, but in spite of, Protection; and 1903 shows a return to the figures of 1894-96., 321839=The rise in the consumption of pork was less than the rise in population until 1903, when it was slightly above it, probably because in a number of households pork has been substituted for butcher\u2019s meat as being cheaper. The consumption of fish has remained stationary between 1880-1903. Only in the case of chicken and game has the consumption increased more than in proportion to the population; but it is a luxury. The annual ration of a Parisian is only 191 lbs. of meat, instead of the 227 lbs. of the soldier\u2019s fare: it has gone back., 149219=This system was inaugurated by the law of January 11, 1892, and passed by the Chamber elected in 1889. The Protectionists had left no stone unturned to ensure a majority; in every district reactionaries bargained with the Republican candidates. Edition: current; Page: [42] \u201cVote for the duties, and we will support you.\u201d Some Protectionists ran labour candidates, paying their expenses in return for their promise of support. Very few Republicans were strong enough to resist; the majority salved their consciences by saying, \u201cAfter all, unless we vote Protectionist we shan\u2019t get in; and we must not let an enemy of the Republic win the seat.\u201d To keep their seats they guaranteed the rent of the landlord and the profits of the manufacturer. It was a wonderful sight to see a large majority whose interests were entirely opposed to Protection enthusiastically overwhelming with presents an insignificant majority consisting almost exclusively of their political opponents., 748269=Figures by themselves have no significance. Since 1887 the International Statistical Institute has done splendid work in attempting to unify and control statistics. The reports of Major Craigie, Secretary to the Board of Agriculture, show the difficulties involved in preparing agricultural statistics, and the lacun\u00e6 that remain there. A yearly report on the statistics of incomes is presented to the Institute by Alfred Neymarck. With their help Sir Alfred Bateman, who was at the head of the Board of Trade, has tried to attain such a unification of method as should permit of the establishment of statistics of international trade; but though some progress has been made, his 1903 report shows how far we still are from the desired end. Since 1903 an attempt has been made in England to classify the imports and exports in the Statistical Abstract in identical groups on the system employed in most countries, except the United States, where a different classification is employed for exports and imports; but tobacco is still classed under food. Pig-iron, which is classed with manufactures in England and the United States, is a raw material in France and Germany., 474618=And this in spite of the 1904 cotton crisis, which deprived Lancashire of its raw material., 227215=Every one consumes in order to produce; the greatest producer is also the greatest consumer; directly, in virtue of the plant he has to supply himself Edition: current; Page: [84] with and the raw material which he purchases, indirectly in virtue of the wages which he pays. If I can prove that under the French Protectionist system the great majority of producers, employed as masters or wage-earners in the majority of industries, have to pay tribute to a few protected industries\u2014no one can say that in denouncing such oppression, I am neglecting the interests of producers, and thinking only of a few officials and people of independent means who consume without producing. I shall not imitate Le Play in going into great detail, but draw my general conclusions from the Blue Books of the French Government. In 1897 the Board of Trade published four volumes of an \u201cInquiry into Wages and Hours of Employment.\u201d Since the Census of Industries and Professions has not yet been published in its complete form, for lack of adequate information as to budgets, I shall only use the edition of 1896, while indicating in passing any important modifications which are already known., 685855=In 1841, Friedrich List, a German who had for long resided in England and the United States, published a book entitled \u201cA National System of Political Economy.\u201d When no one paid any attention to it, he killed himself., 759856=I would have the Belgian Commercial Survey imitated by all other nations. It appears about June 15th. At the beginning are preliminary observations indicating the system according to which amount and prices have been estimated. Allowance made for the difference between gross and net value, the movement of currency assessed, and goods classified which have been temporarily admitted. A resum\u00e9 is given of the total trade of Belgium with foreign countries since 1831; and a table Edition: current; Page: [290] showing the machinery and plant of the country, illustrated by graphs and diagrams. On the same page you can see imports and exports, specific and general trade, transit, quantity and value, and the measure of value employed. But what is the advantage of retaining the French system with its double columns for general trade? The English plan of giving the total of exports and distinguishing re-exports from exports of home goods is infinitely preferable. The Belgian figures are given as follows:\u2014, 802679=Clause 2 of the Act of January 11, 1892\u2014Inequality\u2014Retention of differential duties\u2014As impediments to trade\u2014Effects on raw materials\u2014Transit dues on Colonial produce\u2014Delay and inaccurate appraisement of goods\u2014Duty on oranges\u2014The English Chamber of Commerce in Paris\u2014Exceptions to the duties\u2014Advantages of abolishing the duties\u2014\u201cAbolition of duties on extra European goods imported from a European country in return for a reduction by England of the duties on wines.\u201d, 392274=In June, 1903, a Congress of Social Hygiene met at Montpellier. I am most ready to do justice to the intentions of its organisers and members, but why the title? Private hygiene consists of the rules which the individual has to observe for his own preservation; public hygiene has to do with the cleanliness of public streets, the supply of drinking water, the removal of dirt of every sort\u2014but what is the meaning of social hygiene? An anti-social hygiene is inconceivable. One meets the word \u201csocial\u201d everywhere; people talk of \u201csocial justice\u201d as if justice could exist outside of society. To what idea does this strangely misused word correspond?, 835179=\u201cFacts and Figures. The Basis of Economic Science,\u201d 1904., 357302=Admitting that the French capitalists would not have been capable of doing what the Danes did under pressure of competition; admitting that, if the 2s. 10d. duty had not existed, the owners who produced enough corn to sell it would have lost the \u00a314,000,000 paid to them by the people who bought corn, and so by the consumers of bread; admitting that without the 10s. duty on fresh meat raised in 1903 to 14s. they would have lost not the \u00a328,000,000 estimated by M. Debussy, but \u00a318,000,000\u2014that would have involved a net loss for the producers of corn and live stock of \u00a332,000,000. The whole question is, Who is to bear the loss? If the cause of a loss be rain or drought, the dearness of pasture or the cheapness of produce, internal or external competition, ignorant or unscientific cultivation:\u2014ought that loss to fall upon those immediately concerned\u2014in this case the landowners, who also have the chance of increase in rent\u2014or on those who, without any share in the direction of their business, have no more interest in their chances of gain than Edition: current; Page: [134] in their risks of loss? Perhaps the legislators who imposed the corn duties were themselves convinced, and convinced public opinion, ill-informed on economic questions, that they could charm away the loss resulting from foreign competition? No; they light-heartedly confined themselves to transferring the loss to the consumers, and to that largest class of consumers whose diet is the least varied, the wage-earners of every sort; by cutting down the meat-ration of those on whom the creation of a new population depends, with the connivance of the law they put their hands into the pockets of the class whose daily labour has to support themselves and their families, and whose wages have to extend to some provision for the future, and they gave what they took to the class who, over and above their personal gains, possess an assured revenue in the land., 125767=The treaty of 1860 was anything but pleasing to the agrarians of the Faubourg Saint-Germain and the feudal manufacturers or their successors of the time of Louis Philippe, and M. Pouyer-Quertier made speeches in the Chamber on the fatal consequences of commercial treaties that were as false as they were grandiloquent: that France was not ruined by them was proved by her recovery from the fearful crisis of 1870-1871. When Thiers came into office, however, he showed that he had not abandoned the reactionary economic views he held in 1851. Dutiable articles were hunted out; a tax on raw materials was proposed, but even Thiers with all his position and prestige, could not get it passed. His suggestion to Mr. Gladstone to compromise with Free Trade principles so far as to permit him to apply the old Protectionist doctrines in spite of the treaty, was na\u00efve enough, and in February, 1872, the National Assembly actually passed Edition: current; Page: [32] a resolution which pledged the French Government to repudiate the commercial treaties with England and Belgium. Nevertheless, the majority in the country remained true to economic freedom; when the Minister of Commerce, M. de Meaux, put the question to the vote in the Chamber there were sixty-two votes to fourteen for renewal, a result which certain speakers went so far as to say that they regarded as a step towards complete freedom. The Higher Board of Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry, composed of men with Protectionist interests, was timid, and even the Protectionist leaders, both great cotton-spinners, Pouyer-Quertier and Feray, were satisfied with a rise of 20 to 25 per cent. on the conventional tariff. On April 9, 1877, M. Teisserenc de Bort, Minister of Commerce and Agriculture, introduced a general tariff scheme, reproducing the conventional tariff, except for a 10 per cent. rise in the duties on cotton threads and textiles\u2014a step towards freedom. Then came the political crisis, known as May 16. Marshal MacMahon having a majority in the Chamber, at the command of the Vatican dismissed the Ministry, and dissolved the Chamber with the aid of a reactionary Cabinet.1 The capitalists, mine-owners, and cotton-spinners, who have always almost, without exception, been at the head of the Protectionist party, seized the opportunity of showing their sympathy with MacMahon, to demand in return for their support a rise in the tariff, already on the table of the House. The mine-owners joined together in the issue of a manifesto. When MacMahon went Edition: current; Page: [33] down to Normandy, Pouyer-Quertier, at the head of the cotton-spinners and weavers, presented him with a Protectionist address. But the leaders of May 16th and their partisans were defeated. Political defeat ought to have brought economic defeat in its train, but the very reverse was the case. Teisserenc de Bort returned to the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture, and instead of maintaining the tariff already on the table, he produced a new one drawn up in accordance with the petitions of Pouyer-Quertier and his allies, which contained, instead of a 10 per cent. increase on the conventional tariff for cottons, a rise of almost 24 per cent. on all manufactured goods. What was the cause of this fiscal concession to defeated opponents? And when M. Tirard, a staunch Republican with Free Trade ideas, succeeded him in office, instead of reverting to the tariff antecedent to May 16th, he adopted the later tariff. In future the Republican party made it its business to fulfil the fiscal ideals of its most pronounced opponents\u2014those capitalist manufacturers of Orleanist or Bonapartist creation, who used their authority and their economic influence against Republicanism and Republican institutions; those landowners, legitimists almost to a man, who, descended from the \u00e9migr\u00e9s, had had rich wives found for them by Jesuits in girls greedy for titles; men who spent most of the year on their estates, hand in glove with the priest, busy founding Congregation Schools for girls, and actively engaged in those conspiracies against the Republic, representing free parliamentary government, which are called Boulangism, Anti-semitism, or Nationalism., 611679=In 1902, Mr. Seddon, the Australian Prime Minister, made himself famous by the following statement in a speech he made in London: \u201cThe excess of your imports costs you yearly 200,000,000 gold sovereigns.\u201d, 112171=In 1836 Count Jaubert had declared, \u201cNo society can outgrow aristocracy: the aristocracy of the July Government is composed of great manufacturers and employers: they are the feudatories of the new dynasty.\u201d Thus they had the right to demand privileges. But the 1848 Revolution replaced a system based on property qualification by one of political equality, and substituted universal for restricted suffrage. Was the policy of universal suffrage to be the same as that dictated by the electors of the Restoration with their dual vote, and by the 200,000 copyholders of the Louis Philippe Government?, 187414=showing a diminution of \u00a396,880. For the workmen the results were purely negative. In 1902-3 there were only 332 sugar manufacturers, and these in the eighteen years after 1884 obtained in bonuses on excess of output \u00a341,360,000, to which must be added, since 1897, \u00a33,000,000 in export bounties and \u00a36,720,000 to the Colonial sugar trade. In all \u00a351,080,000 went to the sugar manufacturers. Thus in France a few hundred sugar manufacturers\u2014only 322 in 1902\u2014received \u00a341,360,000 for a plant not worth \u00a314,000,000, while the number of workmen employed diminished., 586240=In the Economic Notes on Insular Free Trade, which Mr. Balfour addressed to his colleagues in the Ministry, published in September, 1903, apparently logical deductions are put together with consummate skill; but it is all really a mere card-house., 398685=But not only M\u00e9line: in 1894 the Socialists, with Jaur\u00e8s at their head, cut off a slice from the bread of all those who were forced to buy it; led away by the mirage of political power, they dreamed of winning over the rural electors by Protection, as if the peasant proprietor and the agricultural labourer had anything to gain by it! Thus the friends of the poor, the humble, and the disinherited, joined in the work of death carried on by the agrarians., 578600=All the old Protectionist lumber has reappeared, decked out with tinsel and coats of fresh paint to make it look new. When Mr. Chamberlain and his friends can find a single phrase in the books of independent economists which seems to support their views, they quote it with alacrity, and invoke \u201cthe eminent authorities\u201d whom they usually treat with profound contempt. They rely on the old scholastic method, which cut short all questions with two lines from Aristotle. Mr. Chamberlain has perfected the \u201cargument from authority\u201d he has invented an anonymous authority. In his speech of October 6, 1903, he declared that \u201cone of the highest authorities of this country\u201d had told him that \u201cthe Edition: current; Page: [209] incidence of a tax depends upon the proportion between the free production and the tax production\u2014in this case the free production being the home production and the production of the Colonies, the taxed productions the production of the Colonies. \u201cThis gentleman\u201d is of opinion that if, for instance, the foreigner supplies, as he does in the case of meat, two-ninths of the production, the consumer only pays two-ninths of the tax. If he supplies, as he does in the case of wheat, something like three-fourths of the consumption, then the consumer pays three-fourths of the tax. If, as in dairy produce, he supplies half of the production, then the consumer pays half the tax. I do not know who this \u201chigh authority\u201d is who persists in remaining anonymous, nor do I know if Mr. Chamberlain has accurately expressed his views; but anyhow he has not explained how there can be two market prices for the same goods, one price for foreign wheat and one for that grown at home and in the Colonies. If this were the incidence of the tax, preferential tariffs would be of no avail, since they would not raise the price of home or colonial products. Mr. Chamberlain wisely adds, \u201cThis is a theory like any other. . . . \u201d It is not a theory like any other: it is at variance with all known facts., 92710=Since 1793 England had been the sole object of all the commercial measures taken by France. With the Restoration there came a complete change. Louis XVIII., knowing how much he owed to England, was unwilling to maintain the hostile provisions of the law of the 6th Brumaire. The prohibitionists, however, regarded him with suspicion, and the law of December, 1814, forbade any alteration of the tariff by royal decrees except in the direction of an increase, with a reservation, however, in the case of raw material. It permitted the export of corn when the price of wheat was not above 5s. 31/2d. to 6s. 4d. per bushel, according to the district, while on import there was merely a 41/2d. duty per cwt. of grain or flour., 433363=The result, then, of the Tariff Commission\u2019s Report on cotton is an approximate increase of 100-146 from 1876-80 to 1904., 285455=In time of peace the actual rations of the French soldier are 26 oz. of bread and 101/2 oz. of meat, without counting vegetables, sugar, and coffee; and over and above the ordinary bread ration pieces of 41/2 oz. are given out with the soup twice a day, thus increasing the ration to 35 ozs. There are certain substitutes, however, for the bread given out with soup. The meat ration of 101/2 oz. is uncooked and includes bones; from the weight one-fifth, or 20 per cent., must be deducted for bones. The account puts the meat, when cooked with the bones, at 46 per cent. The meat book of the Military Academy at Saint Cyr for February, 1905, runs: Paris meat of the best quality (i.e., the lower portions, neck, loin, ribs, and some portions of the cheek without bones, and flank portions), net weight 99 lbs., 75 per cent. being meat and 25 per cent. bones when uncooked. The cooked meat was 57 lb., bone 151/2 lb., 55 per cent. Edition: current; Page: [110] being the average for the high-class fare from which the above example is taken. Thus the average of cooked meat may be taken as 50 per cent., 723521=Here is a striking example of the different phases through which a Cartel may pass: In 1900 the Paper Syndicate raised the price of paper 33 per cent.; this rise naturally produced its normal effect\u2014increased output, creation of new works, installation of new machinery. The competition of factories outside the Syndicate compelled it to lower its output to 45 per cent. The members submitted to this reduction only on condition that it applied solely to the qualities of paper included in their agreement, and then devoted all their energy to the production of the other qualities, the result being over-production. To clear the home market the Syndicate forced exportation; paper was offered abroad at 10 to 15 per cent. reduction; the Hamburg wholesale dealers paid 2d. or 21/4d. for goods that cost the home consumer 21/2d. or 23/4d. Since some of these consumers were manufacturers of paper goods, exporting half their output, their position with regard to foreign competitors was one of marked inferiority., 496169=In 1904 in England the price of a quartern loaf was:\u2014, 267015=Out of a total production of \u00a317,760,000 in 1902, and \u00a31,680,000 in 1903, \u00a34,000,000 and \u00a33,560,000 respectively go to silk and cotton mixtures, whose price was raised by the French Customs duties on cotton yarn, especially in the high numbers., 190778=The years 1899-1901 were marked by a series of attempts in Senate and Chamber at the creation of import, or rather export, bonds. For every cwt. of wheat brought from abroad the exporter might claim a bond for 2s. 10d., limited in every case to a depreciation of three months\u2019 interest and a deduction of 4 per cent., payable on demand by the Treasury. The Higher Board of Agriculture threw out the scheme as extravagant, but on July 7th it was passed in the Chamber in spite of the opposition of M\u00e9line, who was frightened by the boldness of his disciples, one of whom, M. Viger, introduced the project in the Senate. Thus, at the very time when the failure of the sugar bounties was most glaring, an attempt was made to apply the same system to wheat: the 2s. 10d. duty was to encourage the landowners to produce and to restrict home consumption, while the high bounty in the Budget was to induce foreigners, and especially England, to consume French wheat. The effects of such a system would have been as follows: Edition: current; Page: [66] In 1897 the harvest failed; on May 4, 1898, on the eve of the election, M\u00e9line, as President of the Chamber of Commerce, followed exactly the opposite policy to that of 1885: then a duty of 1s. 3d. had been imposed, now the 2s. 10d. duty was suspended until July. Some 38 to 40 million cwt. of wheat came in, an excess of about 8 millions over what was needed:\u2014, 220014=Revenge of the \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u2014War policy of the Protectionists\u2014Property in tariffs\u2014Tyranny of protected interests over the Government\u2014The 1860 treaty\u2014An economic policy worse than Colbert\u2019s\u2014Universal suffrage hoodwinked., 322419=I have made an inquiry from the mayors of the towns in France whose population has most rapidly increased, comparing the development in the consumption of butchers\u2019 meat and other animal food. With the exception of Angoul\u00eame there is no increase in the consumption of animal food except in the case of towns where the consumption was very low; and except in Bordeaux, Angoul\u00eame, and N\u00eemes there is no case where the consumption reaches the standard of the military ration. In Toulouse the smallness of the consumption of meat is astounding: 61/4 lbs. per head! I know that it is said that a country man coming to the town eats less meat than the native town-dweller, and that this might explain why the consumption of meat should not keep pace with the increase in numbers. But even so, the discrepancy is so striking in some towns, e.g., Edition: current; Page: [123] Lyons and Marseilles, that it is difficult not to believe that consumption has absolutely diminished, and that there is some connection between this result and the rise in the price of meat. In this rise an element is the Customs duties. Between 1863 and 1881 the importation of fresh meat was free of duty; on November 3, 1881, a duty of 1s. 3d. was imposed. The law of January 11, 1892, raised the tax to 10s. per cwt. on beef, 13s. on mutton, and 5s. on pork; the law of April, 1898, raised the duty on pork to 7s. 2d.; the law of July, 1903, to 14s. on beef and mutton and 10s. on pork., 36240=I wrote a book called \u201cThe Sugar Question in 1901.\u201d On March 5, 1902, the Brussels Convention was signed, proving once more the truth of William of Orange\u2019s remark, \u201cOne must not wait to hope to undertake.\u201d, 404652=This, is indeed, the psychology of Protection, but Adam Smith did less than justice to his countrymen. They had not only adopted Free Trade principles in 1846; they now regarded them as indisputable as the rule of three. Gladstone said wittily, \u201cAll Englishmen without exception are Free Traders, but they are not all Free Traders without exception.\u201d Protectionists were already putting forward pretexts to try the ground, for the economic reaction which appeared in Germany in 1879 under Bismarck, and in France in 1877, showed itself in England after 1880 in the expression \u201cFair Trade,\u201d and in the growth of a movement strong enough to cause the appointment of a Commission into the causes of trade depression. There were two reports: that of the majority was for Free Trade, the minority report recommended a 10 per cent. duty on manufactures and on such articles of food as could be produced by India Edition: current; Page: [157] and the other colonies. A small number of landowners, as a tribute to tradition rather than from conviction, continued to protest against Free Trade. In 1896 the Cobden Club celebrated its jubilee: its principal members did not trouble to conceal their contempt for continental Free Traders, and the sense of security inspired by their own indisputable success. Nevertheless, a certain member of Parliament, Mr. Howard Vincent, got an Act passed, obliging all goods to carry a mark of origin\u2014German goods being stamped, \u201cMade in Germany.\u201d Under this title Mr. E. E. Williams, a Fabian, published a book showing that many small objects of everyday use were made in Germany. Out of his surprise box he produced the German bogey, and many grown-up children retain their childish fear of the bogey; it is a necessary part of their scheme of existence., 85559=It would appear that the collection of Customs dues was singularly arbitrary. Nevertheless, in 1826 the Duke of Pasquier said that \u201cthe competition opened by the treaty of 1786 did more to encourage industry than all the prohibitions that it repealed.\u201d, 692939=The Emperor, whose speeches at Essen and Breslau in 1902 showed his hatred of the Socialists, saw that it was suicidal for a Government, such as Edition: current; Page: [260] he intended to maintain, to encourage the growth of an industrial population in Germany: reversing the political traditions of the last quarter of a century he aimed at an agrarian policy. But it is certain that taxes on food have never operated to send workmen from factories and mines back to the land; nor does any better success attend the policy of artificially retaining on the soil the labourers who are anxious to leave it, by means of taxes which make the town workers dependent on the agricultural interest. The 1902 tariff contained a minimum tariff for cereals which narrowed the field of possible treaties of commerce. The duty on rye and oats was raised to 2s. 6d. per cwt. (a rise of 43 per cent. on the first and 78 per cent. on the second); that on wheat to 2s. 10d. (a rise of 57 per cent.); that on brewing barley to 2s. (a rise of 100 per cent.); while the duty on other barley was 7d. The duty on beef was raised to 6s. per cwt., the average weight of an ox being reckoned in Germany as 12 cwt., of which 58 per cent. can be used as food. When Von B\u00fclow laid the commercial treaties before the Reichstag on February 1, 1905, he took care, in order to curry favour with the agrarians, to announce a rise in the duty on bacon from 2s. 6d. to between 6s. and 7s. The trebling of the duty was greeted by violent protests from the Extreme Left. \u201cYou protest against the increase in Customs on foodstuffs? Follow the example of the Radical majority in the French Republic. They passed a duty of 2s. 10d. on wheat\u2014higher than ours, that is. In 1903 they raised the duties on live stock to 8s. per cwt., making the tax on meat 14s., and raised the duties on pork to Edition: current; Page: [261] 6s. and 10s. What have you to complain of when they pay more than you will have to do?\u201d Von B\u00fclow was right. French fiscal policy was as incoherent as the German; but there is no logic in imitating some one else\u2019s want of logic., 715690=The increase in exports from 1895 on is due to Caprivi\u2019s policy of commercial treaties, which, however, the Emperor did not hesitate to sacrifice to agrarians. The increase of exports in 1902-3 is not due to prosperity, but to the liquidation of the stock incurred at the time of the crisis of 1902, as the following table of the production and trade in iron proves\u2014(\u00b7000 tons):\u2014, 242804=That the 1892 tariff did not increase the export of men\u2019s clothes is proved by two tables; thus export, 631691=McKinley was elected in 1896, not on the tariff but on the silver question; but at the opening of the session of Congress in March, 1897, a raised tariff, drawn up beforehand by Mr. Dingley, the President of the Committee of Ways and Means, was forced through, amended by the Senate, and signed by the President in July. In spite of the protests of the manufacturers, the duties on wool, wool raw material, with the same duties on woollen cloths and worsteds as in 1890, were reimposed. The duties ad valorem were combined with the specific duties of 1890. Duties on cotton slightly lower than those of 1890 were imposed; those on iron and steel remained unchanged with the exception of cutlery and small arms. The duty on coal, fixed at 3s. 11/2d. in 1890 (75 cents) and 1s. 8d. (40 cents), 1894, was raised to 2s. 101/2d. (67 cents). This tariff is still in force, and may be regarded as the maximum of Protection which America will support. In the electoral campaign of 1904 the Republicans declared their belief in Protection, the Democrats in Free Trade; but the Democrats made the mistake of not formulating the reforms they would introduce if returned to power, while the Republicans did admit that modifications might be introduced. Theodore Roosevelt declared in the letter in which he accepted the Presidency that \u201cThe schedules are liable from time to time to modification and revision to meet changed conditions; that can only be done safely by those who are devoted to the cause of Protection.\u201d In certain states, for example Massachusetts, although Roosevelt polled a majority, the Democratic candidate was elected a governor, Edition: current; Page: [234] which showed that there were Free Traders among those who contributed to his overwhelming success. The question was, \u201cWould his message deal with the tariff, and would he call an extra session to deal with it?\u201d He merely said, \u201cThe tariff must be applied in a progressive spirit and in accordance with the changing conditions of the times.\u201d But it is easy to predict that the tariff will be modified after the next presidential election, and modified in a liberal direction. Optimists quote the American dictum, \u201cYou can fool some of the people all the time, or all the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time.\u201d, 183140=Without going back so far as the ancien r\u00e9gime since 1819, the sugar industry had been a political one, owing its very existence to the Legislature. The law of 1884 was of the same character as all those passed during the nineteenth century, its objects being (1) to extend the consumption of sugar, (2) to limit internal consumption, (3) to encourage foreign consumption at the expense of French consumers. The tax was levied on account, but assessed at less than the real amount, the sugar produced over and above being exempt in whole or part; the difference between the amount taxed and the total output constituting a bonus on manufacture. Almost immediately on the passing of the Bill the excess was 21 to 31 per cent. of the output. The bounty ate up the tax.1 In bringing forward the Bill of 1884 giving bounties to the sugar industry, M. M\u00e9line declared that he was acting in the workmen\u2019s interests; but the results for the workmen are shown in the Blue Books:\u2014, 202499=In 1881 came reaction; the ad valorem were replaced by specific duties, and some duties were raised. England refused under these conditions to renew the commercial treaty. In the following period\u20141882-1886\u2014the annual average was for\u2014, 717947=If the prosperity of an industry were measurable by its exports the metal trade in Germany would never have been so prosperous as in 1902 and 1903. This was due to the crisis when the impossibility of selling at home forced goods on to the foreign market. Business looked up; there was an increase in home consumption, as is shown by the Edition: current; Page: [269] fall in exports. In spite of the two years of crisis and a persistent attempt to extend exportation, its total only reached 30 per cent. over the four years, and in 1904, when there was a maximum output of iron, the export of iron actually diminished, which only proves that more was consumed at home, and that this accounted for the increased industrial activity. The sworn believers in the balance of commerce had to see here the ruin of Germany, since imports continued in excess of exports in spite of the Cartels and export bounties. The average importation between 1900-1904 was \u00a3290,000,000, while that of exportation was \u00a3240,000,000\u2014\u00a350,000,000 less. And yet\u2014oh, irony!\u2014all the efforts of the national system of political economy were directed to the encouragement of exports., 120489=Free Trade is in line with the revolution in the means of transport; it allows the full benefit to be obtained from railways, steamships, and electric telegraphy instead of trying to fight against them. English fiscal policy has been a consistent attempt to remove from the tariff those small and vexatious duties which are useless from the point of view of revenue. After 1846 the Government continued to simplify the tariff. The expiration of the funded annuities of the National Debt put some fifty-three millions at its disposal., 264847=The weaving and spinning of silk stands next in importance to wool, giving employment to some 136,000 persons, 80,000 in weaving, 20,000 in silk-throwing, and 26,000 in spinning. The weavers of Lyons are Free Trade, but the spinners who supply them with the silk, that is, their raw material, are Protectionists, who, though they failed to get Customs dues on raw silk, had got bounties on a pretence of defending the French cocoon. This splendid system led in 1902 to the production of 1,254,000 lbs. out of a European production of 11,943,800, and a world production of 41,005,800 lbs., which fell in 1903 to 1,042,800 out of a European production of 9,605,200, and a world production of 39,681,400. In 1902 16,627,600 lbs. were put on the French market, of which total the home produce was only 7 per cent.; in 1903 15,250,400 lbs., of which the home produce was only 6 per cent. The bounty system had not increased the number of silk-growers. There were 148,971 in 1893 with 225,000 oz. of eggs; in 1902 only 128,199 with 198,427, and 120,266 in 1903 with 262,145. In his report to the Customs Commissioners for 1902, M. Baumlin, President of the Committee on Silk, said that the bounty system was of no use in encouraging the production of silk; it did not attract the peasants to plant mulberries. The Edition: current; Page: [98] bounties on spinning have only assisted a few big firms. In 1898 there were 273 manufacturers with 11,823 vats; in 1901 there were 247 with 11,250 vats., 697792=The agrarian policy of the Government was expounded by Posadowski, the Home Secretary, at a meeting of the Reichstag, on February 23, 1905, as intended to balance the impatient and \u201chysteria\u201d of German public and political life by the agricultural interest which he called \u201cthe solid anchor of the ship of state\u201d; the stable element of agriculture was to act as a counterpoise to the floating population of the towns which formed the unprecedentedly large Radical majority in the Reichstag. He admitted that such a policy, aimed against the representatives of trade and manufacture involved an increase in the cost of living; and though he did not say that the Government imagined that such a result would enlist support, he did, like Mr. Chamberlain at Glasgow, affirm categorically that it would raise wages., 171168=The exports from France into Italy were in 1902 \u00a36,992,250, and in 1903, \u00a36,639,000. Those from Edition: current; Page: [57] Italy into France were \u00a35,965,290 and \u00a36,779,520. So the exports from France only slightly exceeded those of 1897, and the exports from Italy to France were about \u00a36,000,000 less than they were in 1887., 688087=In 1879 Bismarck embarked on a fiscal policy which led to the shipwreck of his political enterprise: until 1890 the Emperor William II. was faithful to his plans, only to throw them overboard; by a more than Swiftian irony the measures employed to assist national as a matter of fact assisted foreign industry: and all this forces us to the conclusion that the national Political Economy was but a will-o\u2019-the-wisp: its pompous title a glittering covering for the old fallacies., 626434=The strict constructionists, holding by the letter of the Constitution, maintained that it only permitted the collection of taxes for revenue purposes. In 1819, however, the loose constructionists, interpreting its spirit more liberally, maintained that the power of regulating trade and providing for defence gave the Government the right of imposing protective taxes. In 1824, having a majority, they passed a tariff definitely framed to exclude foreign commodities; it was followed by the 1828 tariff, so strongly protective that the South protested against what they called \u201clegalised robbery.\u201d An attempt to aggravate it in 1832 led to the Clay Compromise in 1833, which provided that the duties were gradually to diminish until 1842, when all were to be reduced to 20 per cent. and a revenue tariff established. It was completed by the high revenue tariff of 1846. The Republican party, founded in 1856, made Protection an article in its programme, but the fiscal surplus of 1857 caused a reduction to a scale below that of 1816. During the Civil War two tariffs, August 5 and December 24, 1861, raised the duties in order to obtain revenue., 676673=When imports and exports are taken together\u2014and their proportion is very nearly equal\u2014France stands third among the nations trading with the United States. The McKinley Tariff did not succeed in checking French imports; they rose 25 per cent. between 1896-7, when they stood at 67,530,000 dollars, and 1902-04, when they were 84,680,000; and in spite of the M\u00e9line Tariff the exportation of American manufactures to France rose from 6,049,000 dollars in 1892 to 26,775,000 dollars in 1900, and to 16,786,000 in 1903., 568091=Between 1896 and 1904 for these two countries, Canada\u2019s principal importers have risen 156 per cent. for United States, 84 per cent. United Kingdom., 490964=It is not enough to have vast territories suitable for wheat-growing; to work them an adequate supply of men and capital is needed. The immense area of Edition: current; Page: [182] Canada produced in 1902, a year when the harvest was good, 9,875,000 imperial quarters; the little British Isles in the same year 7,285,000 quarters only 26 per cent. less., 754432=How do we get at the values given in the Customs Returns? Up till 1854 they were based, in England, on the prices of nearly two centuries back; between 1854-1870 the Board of Trade figures were taken from existing prices; after 1870 on the returns made by the merchants of their transactions, which could be relied upon, since there were no Customs duties, except in the case of some dozen articles, to prevent their making straightforward returns. And it is due to this freedom from fiscal pre-occupation that the English figures are more reliable than those of any other country. The English Customs House does not valuate; it merely registers declared values at the port of arrival or departure. The Board of Trade does not measure; it simply states. But even here an average has to be struck to allow for fluctuation in price and seasonal variation. The same positive system is followed in Russia and Portugal., 145329=The problem remains: How had the great manufacturers, a weak minority, succeeded in forcing the Republican majority to endorse their claims? The majority of the population was rural, according to the 1876 census, 19,000,000 being employed in agriculture; how could members representing this majority consent to duties of 20 to 40 per cent. on iron and steel; 40 to 300 per cent. on cotton thread, and textiles; to taxes which weighed so heavily on the labourer\u2019s plough and threshing machine, on the shoes, coats, smock-frocks, dresses, and linen of the whole population? The tax on wheat, indeed, remained at 31/2d. a hundredweight; but the tax on cattle had been raised to 12s. on an ox worth \u00a316 to \u00a324\u2014that is, about 3 per cent. protection. This protection was much less than that given to the manufacturers; how did the agriculturists allow themselves to be fleeced to support the Edition: current; Page: [40] claims of the manufacturers? Although M. Pouyer-Quertier was called the \u201cMarquis of Dear Bread,\u201d he did not dare to raise the tax on corn; the agrarians were afraid of rousing a violent change of opinion; they modestly contented themselves with a 12s. duty on live stock. But the manufacturers said to them, \u201cSupport us, vote for our duties. In the name of Free Trade we will get agricultural products off the conventional tariff. If you support us, we will support you in our turn.\u201d The bargain was struck. When the 1881 tariff was put in operation the landlords recalled the promise, but the manufacturers were not very anxious to carry it out. They waited till the eve of the 1885 elections. May 28th the 3d. duty per hundredweight on wheat was raised to 1s. 21/2d., 518581=Mr. Chamberlain talked at first of the necessity of drawing closer together the bonds between the United Kingdom and the Colonies, but the projected Edition: current; Page: [188] taxes on foreign agricultural products were instantly hailed by Lord Harris and Mr. Brassey as protection to English agriculture. But do protective duties remove agriculture from the danger of crises? There were high duties in 1821, 1822, 1833, 1836, and 1837, when the House of Commons nominated the Commission to inquire into agricultural depression, and in France the groans of the landowners have been louder than ever since they have been given a monopoly of their countrymen\u2019s food supply., 211282=These figures lead to the following conclusions: England, already possessing a greater measure of liberty, received during the first quinquennial period less stimulus than France from the commercial treaty, In the last period\u20141876-1880\u2014the increase in the percentage of imports is greater in France than in England, and in the percentage of exports rather less; but France had lost Alsace and Lorraine. After the 1881 tariff, French exports show, at first, a falling off, while English continue to increase. For the last five years the figures show that French imports are stagnant, while exports have only developed 18 per cent. relatively to the period 1876-1880, whereas English exports have developed 38 per cent. Thus events have not given the lie to the confidence of the Free Traders; can the same be said of Protectionist prophecies?, 536952=In 1902-1903 the gross income from agriculture in the United Kingdom was \u00a385,000,000. Consequently if Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s programme produced its maximum effect it would add 5\u00b764 per cent. to this income. The tax on food would bring in more to the British landowner than to the Colonies, and thus the magnificent Imperial policy would be no more than a cloak for unscrupulous agrarianism. Even so, however, it could not attain its ends, since Protection, like reduction, only succeeds where it is considerable., 645643=National expenditure is relatively small; the National Debt also\u2014$914,500,000; the interest being $25,541,000, i.e., 32 cents\u20141s. 4d. per head. The ordinary budget was $560,000,000 in 1903, of which $279,800 came from the Customs, and represented a tax of 14s. 8d. per head\u2014according to the Protectionists the total effect of the duty. In so far, however, as the tariff did not raise the price of home products by the full amount of the tax, it failed of its protective purpose; and it is therefore not enough, in increasing the burden it imposed, to look at what the Treasury received: that is found by multiplying the rise in price of dutiable articles by the amount consumed., 691100=The result was that they polled three million votes at the 1904 election., 274857=This group employs about 335,000 persons\u2014tanning and leather-dressing, 48,000; boot-making, 220,000; saddlery, 54,000; gloves, 20,000. All industries employing leather feel the effect of Customs duties varying from 8s. to \u00a35 on prepared skins. Between 1888-1890 our average export of shoes was 45,600 cwt. at \u00a32,560,000; it fell between 1901-1903 to 30,000 cwt. at \u00a3680,000. Our average export of gloves was worth \u00a32,096,000 from 1880-1890; between 1901-1903 it fell to below \u00a31,400,000. The duties on the goods which serve as raw materials for our finished manufactures compel us to sell dear and export dear., 833706=Journal of the Statistical Society of Paris, 1901., 464280=Mr. Chamberlain has never had a chance. He declared that England was ruined; her trade and industry in a galloping consumption; if imports were increasing, exports were diminishing. The foreign trade returns for 1903 gave him the lie in the most striking manner; the total had never been so high; it was \u00a3903,353,641\u2014\u00a326,000,000 above the record years 1900 and 1902. It represented \u00a324 19s. per head; whereas, even in the annus mirabilis 1873, when prices were much higher, it was only \u00a321 4s. Comparing this total with those of the other six great nations, and subtracting \u00a325,000,000 to allow for the fact that their returns are for 1902, not 1903, we find that the English total compared with Germany, the highest of them, is as 170 to 100., 251475=This manufacture employs some 100,000 persons; and it stands tenth in the list of French exports at \u00a354,400,000. Dependent altogether on the protected industries, it pays duty on the flour used for making paste, on the wire on which the flowers are fixed which are made of dutiable paper. In the Seine Department there is a falling off in the number of employ\u00e9s; 18,207 in 1896, it was only 16,865 in 1901. From the above statistics the conclusion can be drawn that Protection, restricting the choice of materials, injures these industries. They need free scope, and their expansion is hindered by Protection to those textiles on which they depend., 821020=In 1900, to meet the expenses of the Transvaal War, the taxes on wines were raised in the following manner:\u2014, 774330=His own ideal is to fasten the labourer to the land. He declares that peasant proprietors are diminishing, though statistics prove that such is not the case. There were 2,150,000 in 1882, and 2,199,000 in 1892. Peasant proprietorship is the ideal of all reformers who believe that the well-being of a nation consists in a state of somnolence. Peasant proprietors are a good sort of people, easily governed, very respectful to authority; but as a matter of fact neither they nor the great landowners are the real representatives of agriculture; it is in the hands of the farmers. The farmer is not an owner: he has to spend all his capital on his implements, his cattle, and his expenses: most farmers, finding it easy to rent land, Edition: current; Page: [298] take more than they can really cultivate, and go in for extensive rather than intensive cultivation. In spite of agrarian alarmists the number of farmers has not diminished: there were 968,000 in 1882, 1,061,000 in 1892., 314319=The baker then transfers to his customers the price of the corn plus the duty. When the price of bread was raised 1/4d. to 1/2d. per pound, every family in France was affected. They turned to the Government\u2014and rightly enough, for it was responsible for the dearness due to the Customs. Instead, however, of demanding no more intervention, they asked for more; they asked that the bakers should be forbidden to raise the price of bread by the amount of the rise Edition: current; Page: [119] in the price of corn; in the country they implored the mayors, in Paris the Prefect, to put in force Article 30 of the Law of July 19-22, 1791. This Article, provisionally inserted in the law guaranteeing freedom to labour, had stood for 115 years; it gave to mayors the right of taxing bread and meat; and mayors were now found ready to force the bakers to sell their products cheaper than the raw material of which they were made. But no tradesman exercises his trade to ruin himself; when the mayors prepared to put these suggestions into operation the bakers lowered the quality of their flour; and, knowing that a sphere, as presenting the smallest surface for its size, delays evaporation, they made their loaves round., 301140=In spite of all the stimuli given to corn production, the surest proof that France needs foreign corn is that importation continued in spite of the 2s. 10d. duty per cwt. imposed in 1904., 414075=and the last period, 1900-04, exceeds all the others. But, say the Protectionists, the increase in foreign trade is an increase in imports, and these twentieth-century politicians believe with Colbert that imports spell ruin., 307018=A fall in the price of corn sends down prices in England, the United States, and Germany; in 1882 the difference relative to Great Britain was in our favour\u2014it is now nearly 3s. against us. In 1887 the duty was raised to 5 francs in France and 5 marks in Germany., 95517=A proposition was introduced for making provision Edition: current; Page: [13] for bad years by filling granaries in the good, and the Government scheme was carried further in Committee. The Finance Minister, Vill\u00e8le, represented the great landowners of the Upper Garonne. \u201cThe Home Secretary,\u201d said M. Am\u00e9, \u201cfights with the Finance Minister, and he in his turn has to face the Chief Director of Customs and M. H\u00e9ly d\u2019Oissel, the royal agent.\u201d The Committee\u2019s scheme was passed. \u201cWhat justification was there,\u201d asked M. Voyer d\u2019Argenson, \u201cfor disturbing the happy equilibrium between producer and consumer established in 1815, simply because the landowners who paid \u00a312 were considered the only qualified representatives of the nation, and for making a monopoly of what was before only preference?\u201d Facts remained ironic: the harvest was comparatively good, and prices went down in 1822. Protection for corn was not enough; cattle must be protected. In 1664 Colbert had only taxed cattle 2s. 6d. per head; neither the Republic nor the Empire had placed any duty on food; the law of 1816 taxed fat cattle 2s. 8d. and medium stock in proportion. M. de Bourrienne declaimed against \u201cthe fatal superabundance of meat\u201d; an amendment suggested raising the duty to 26s. 1d., the Committee to 40s.; and M. de Bourrienne declared that were that not enough a provisional decree could set things right. A Western deputy, indeed, asked for a duty of 88s. Germany threatened to retaliate. Threats and an aggravation of the tariff was the only reply. The Revolution had abolished the privileges and exemptions of the nobles; the \u00e9migr\u00e9s and their descendants were taking their revenge. If they paid taxes they Edition: current; Page: [14] recouped themselves by private dues levied on all their countrymen who had to buy bread or meat; they satisfied their ancient grudges and at the same time looked after themselves with great success. They completed their work by heavy charges on industry. When smelting was done by means of charcoal the ironmasters were owners of the forests. Since 1814 they had insisted on the iron tax of 1794 and 1806 being raised, and meantime, by means of the royal decree of 1814, which ordered iron to be put in bonded warehouses, they put a stop to importation. The projected tax of 12s. on a product which sold at 24s. to 28s. raised the price 50 per cent., but the ironmasters clamoured for prohibition. The Government, however, introduced their tariff as a provisional measure, and in compliance with the will of Louis XVIII. announced that they should demand its gradual reduction. In spite of this, however, the duties on iron steadily rose. In 1822 the Commission\u2019s scheme was passed by 217 votes to 78, in spite of M. Laborde\u2019s protests: \u201cThe law which you are about to pass is a law of partial privilege: all France is to pay a bounty to the ironmasters and the Norman cattle-breeders.\u201d The law of 1826 marks the zenith of Restoration Protectionism. The landowners, pretending that they were always being sacrificed to the manufacturers, demanded the exclusion of foreign wools and obtained a tariff as complicated as it was oppressive. In spite of the Government the tax on fat cattle was made to apply to lean; the duty on vegetables was doubled. Raw cotton had been penalised, as competing with flax. In 1820 Leclerc Edition: current; Page: [15] de Beaulieu, declaring cotton textiles \u201ca plague to France,\u201d demanded their prohibition, and Saint Chamans wanted the duty on silk and cotton mixtures raised from 32s. to 120s.; Kergariou asked that linen and hemp should be absolutely prohibited, and Saint Cricq himself had to put in a warning voice\u2014\u201cWe must not prohibit everything.\u201d, 124214=At the beginning of the century there were 1,550 articles in the English Customs Tariff, 2,900 in the Irish; they were reduced to twenty-six, of which ten were excise duties, equivalent to inland duties, while the others were merely revenue taxes, reduced still further in the following years. In 1897 there were only nine of them; after the war about a dozen., 263825=In 1892 very high tariffs were set up for flax spinning and linen weaving. The stimulus of Protection led to over-production. In the 1902 Reports of the Customs Commission, edited by M. Widmer, President of the Linen Committee, it runs as follows: \u201cExports passed the high total of 1900, and rose to more than twenty-two million pounds. Such an unprecedented total shows that something is wrong at Edition: current; Page: [97] home, for such sales abroad could only be effected at a heavy loss\u2014an evil that must be endured in order to clear the market, but still an evil.\u201d, 497281=Mr. Chamberlain, however, calls the cry of dear bread \u201can imposture,\u201d the Times \u201can appeal to ignorant prejudice.\u201d M. M\u00e9line used the same sort of language in 1887 when he taxed wheat but not bread; afterwards seeing that there is a relation between the price of a product and that of its raw material, he put a duty on bread equal to that on wheat., 634766=American Protectionists rely on the authority of List, who followed Colbert in the use of the infant industries argument, but tariff history in the United States, as everywhere else, proves that the demands of any industrial group for Protection grow with its growth. The American Protectionist is no better acquainted with economic laws than the European politician. On December 15, 1904, Senator MacCumber said: \u201cOur receipts rise at the rate of 2 per cent. on our imports; every 20 cents that comes into the Treasury from imports shows that we have sent a dollar from this country to that from which the goods come.\u201d Mr. MacCumber evidently has the most profound contempt for economics., 147218=Since 1881, one class, the pig breeders, had been satisfied\u2014not by any rise of duties framed in Parliament, but by an administrative prohibition based on sanitary regulations. A doctor declared before the Hygienic Society that American hams caused trichina. No case of it had ever been known in France, but what matter! A governmental decree of 1881 laid down regulations regarding the importation of American bacon and hams that practically amounted to prohibition, operative until 1890. These hygienic pretexts are a disgrace to the men who prostituted science to Protectionist interests., 568278=At the Colonial Conference in 1902 Mr. Chamberlain said, \u201cThe results have been a deception.\u201d And they have grown worse. The reasons are clearly given in a Board of Trade Memorandum. The United States enjoy geographical advantages which no preferential tariff can abolish, and in spite of the tariff Canadian policy, remaining Protectionist, taxes manufactures more heavily than raw materials. England sends manufactures to Canada, and the duties on them are still above the average duty on the goods imported from the United States. In 1903 manufactures ready for consumption brought Edition: current; Page: [204] in 24\u00b73 per cent., \u201cluxuries\u201d 53\u00b756 per cent., most of which came from England. In 1903 the average duty on English imports was 17 per cent., while that on American imports was only some 121/2 per cent. The preferential tariff produced the usual recrimination. Canadian manufacturers, pretending to be penalised by English competition, got an Act passed, June 20, 1904, which specified that the minimum tariff on cloth and woollen goods should be at least 30 per cent., and that on ropes at least 20 per cent. In 1904 a special tax on commercial travellers was specially aimed against the English ones. Is all this a preparation for Free Trade within the Empire?, 596947=If increased imports had taken work from British workmen, they would have exported themselves. The annual emigration to British possessions between 1854-1860 was, on an average, 134,000, or 48 per 10,000 inhabitants; for 1895-1899, 55,000, or 13 per 10,000; between 1901-1903 it rose to 106,000, or 21 per 10,000., 121059=Michel Chevalier approached Cobden with a proposal for a commercial treaty; Cobden replied that Parliament would not hear of it. Chevalier stuck to his point; he went to see Gladstone, and while admitting that he spoke without official mandate, pledged himself to obtain in return for a sweeping reduction in the duties on wines the abolition of all prohibitions and a merely conventional tariff containing no duty above 30 per cent. Gladstone agreed. The Emperor gave audience to Cobden and Chevalier, and authorised them to draw up, with all possible secrecy, a tariff treaty. The Constitution empowered the sovereign to conclude commercial treaties, but the Emperor was in such dread of the efforts of the Protectionists that not a single member of the Ministry was let into the secret. Copies of the tariff were made by Madame Chevalier, and by the end of the year 1859 the terms of the agreement were fixed, and on January 23, 1860, it was published. It had been laid down as a principle that the tariff was not to exceed an ad valorem duty of 30 per cent., falling in 1864 to 25 per cent.; the final ratification of Edition: current; Page: [29] October 12th and November 16th lowered the duty on threads to between 8 and 10 per cent., on cotton, linen, and woollen textiles to 15 per cent., and at the end of 1864 to 10 per cent. The average duty was 15 per cent., except in the case of certain mineral products, on which it was nearly 30 per cent. As a consequence the French Government, in spite of lively opposition, passed Bills permitting the free importation of wool and other raw materials, and facilitating temporary admission. England went further. The duty was removed from forty-two articles still paying 10 per cent., and Cobden said in a letter to John Bright, \u201cWe are making no concessions to France which do not equally apply to every other nation.\u201d As Morley says in his \u201cLife of Cobden,\u201d instead of reciprocal monopoly there was reciprocal freedom\u2014or at least partial freedom., 299650=In wheat the average supply, allowing for seed sowing, for the last ten years was 7,500,000 tons. Then, according to our formula, 35 ozs. of bread per day = 790 lbs. per year, and for 30,000,000 inhabitants = 10,800,000 tons\u2014i.e., there is a deficiency in supply of 3 million tons, nearly 29 per cent. There are, indeed, certain inferior grains which can be used for human food. The annual average for 1893-1902 gives 1,590,000 tons of rye; 971,000 tons of barley, which, however, is little use for food; 4,115,000 tons of oats, and 554,000 tons of buckwheat, neither of which is a desirable food. The potato harvest was 12,148,000 tons during the decennial period, but 5 million tons go for cattle-feeding, distilleries, and sowing. And according to M. Armand Gautier\u2019s Edition: current; Page: [115] table, the proportion of albuminoids is 12\u00b764 per cent. in fresh grain, home or foreign grown, while in potatoes it is only 1\u00b73 per cent. In a word, for the same amount of albuminous matter, 972 tons of potatoes go to 100 tons of wheat., 698796=Von B\u00fclow\u2019s argument against the Socialists from the example of France was really brilliant. \u201cThey tax wheat,\u201d he said, \u201cand yet wheat is a much more important item of diet in France than it is in Germany.\u201d As a matter of fact, the German wheat crop in 1903 was only 70 million cwt., an allowance of 124 cwt. per 100 inhabitants, while in France it was 440 cwt. per 100. Germany imported 44 million cwt., or 62 per cent. of the total consumption, while the export was negligible in amount; and this made an allowance of little more than 1 cwt. per head. Adding a quarter to arrive at the ordinary ration of the French soldier, and allowing for the lower diet of women, children, and old people, the German allowance of bread is only 275 lb. instead of nearly 790 lb., the normal French allowance., 198752=Trade in 1855-1859 and 1861-1865\u20141876-1880 and 1882-1886\u20141882-1886 and 1899-1903\u2014Stagnation\u2014Comparison with the United Kingdom\u2014Verification of Free Trade prophecies., 110455=The Committee of Labour Defence, with MM. Odier, Mimerel, P\u00e9rier, Lebeuf, at its head, declared that those who benefited by Protection bore the heaviest part of the dues, and that on them national existence depended. They denounced the Journal des D\u00e9bats and \u201ccertain paid professors\u201d for being impertinent enough not to be Protectionists, and they described those who thought their privileges too great as English emissaries; they put up placards to warn factory employ\u00e9s against Free Traders, \u201cwhose only aim was to help England to ruin and then rule over France.\u201d Their anger was, of course, increased by the triumph of Free Trade in England. M. Duch\u00e2tel, the Home Secretary, had said to the Free Trade Association, \u201cBe strong and we stand by you.\u201d The Government was besieged by the arrogant claims of the Protectionists. In March, 1847, M. Cunin-Gridaine brought in a Bill (1) to repeal five prohibitive taxes; (2) to reconsider some minor duties; (3) to free 298 of the 666 articles of the tariff which would have reduced the revenue \u00a31,200,000; (4) to repeal altogether the duty on shipbuilding materials. The Chamber of Commerce opposed these propositions in a vast report drawn up by M. Lanyer. Discussion was prevented by the Revolution of 1848., 560096=In 1904 it imported 400 per cent. more cotton than all the self-governing Colonies put together., 654433=There was a tax of 1s. 1d. (25 cents) per bushel of potatoes; in 1902 7 million bushels had to be imported, with a duty which amounted to nearly 1,500,000 dollars. Nine million dollars came from Edition: current; Page: [246] the duties on eggs, cabbages, oats, and other foodstuffs., 608320=The Memorandum has attempted to ascertain the share of export trade in wages. Wages may be estimated as between 40 and 60, say 50 per cent. in exported manufactures, of which the annual average for 1900-4 was \u00a3232,000,000\u2014i.e., \u00a3116,000,000 in wages; 10 per cent. may be added for repair, secondary labour, &c.; in round numbers wages may be counted as \u00a3120,000,000 to \u00a3130,000,000. According to the inquiries the total wages of industry in the United Kingdom may be estimated at between \u00a3700,000,000 and \u00a3750,000,000; consequently wages of the export trade are less than 20 per cent., or a fifth of the whole, and Mr. Chamberlain is thus attempting to upset the whole of English trade to increase, perhaps by a tenth, Edition: current; Page: [222] a fifth of the total wages. It is always the same, this wonderful system of sacrificing the majority to the minority, risking the normal conditions of industry for hazardous advantages., 117753=I shall not here relate the history of the Free Trade Movement in England, or pause to praise Cobden and John Bright, great as is my admiration for them\u2014that has been often and eloquently done already; I have only to speak of the results of their work, and for that purpose borrow my information from the Blue Book on the Customs Tariff of the United Kingdom from 1800 to 1897. 53 George III. (1815) prohibited the importation of foreign corn when the price of English wheat was less than 80s. a quarter. After 1828 the prohibition ceased, but the duty stood at 20s. 8d. when the price was 67s.; when it fell to 66s. or below, the duty rose by 1s. for every shilling fall in price. In 1820 a petition was presented Edition: current; Page: [27] by the merchants of the city; drawn up by Tooke, it is an admirable demonstration of the need for Free Trade, and from it dates the beginning of the Free Trade Movement. Fourteen times Pelham Villiers proposed the repeal of the Corn Laws. He was supported by Colonel Thompson, in conjunction with whom Cobden founded the Anti-Corn Law League in 1839. To discount the importance of the League, the Government lowered to 51s. a quarter the price above which the duty was to be no more than 20s. This assessment was maintained in 1842, but levied at 51s. a quarter and below. The tariff was preferential; on corn from a British possession outside Europe the duty was 5s. when the price was below 55s. In 1846 Sir Robert Peel\u2019s Bill definitely broke with the policy of Protection. Now people are apt to believe that the Free Traders effected a sudden revolution; as a matter of fact the transition was to take two and a half years; a sliding scale was maintained. The Act provided that on wheat at 48s. a quarter the duty should be 10s., falling to 4s. a quarter when the price rose to 53s. and upwards. This duty remained in force until Feb. 1, 1849, when it fell to 1s. a quarter. This was practically Free Trade. In 1864 it was fixed at 3d. a hundredweight for convenience of assessment, and in 1869 the last tax on corn was abolished. In 1902 the duty of 3d. per hundredweight was reimposed as a war tax, and removed the next year by Mr. Ritchie. And Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s attack on Cobdenism is the merest nibble; in the Glasgow speech of October 6, 1903, he proposed the modest duty of 2s. a quarter, which would be a Free Trade triumph in France., 172934=The tariffs of 1892 were completed by the Act of 1893 dealing with the merchant service. In compensation for expenses resulting from the Customs tariff the law of 1893 established a system of bounties to shipbuilders so arranged as to reduce the construction of steam ships and encourage sailing vessels, which indeed made voyages not so much for the purpose of transportation as of collection of bounties. The law was, in fact, the death-blow to the construction of the vessels which it was designed to encourage. French dockyards having a monopoly, demanded such extravagant prices that the class of shipbuilders disappeared, and if there was any development in the building of sailing ships, that of steam ships sank to a negligible quantity. The following table gives the tonnage of vessels constructed under the system of the law of 1893:\u2014, 106898=With the exception of Marseilles the seaport towns demanded the repeal of prohibition; the County Council of Arras argued against Protection, and petitions in favour of a gradual diminution of duties were sent up by the Chambers of Commerce of Strassburg, Tours, Clermont Ferrand, Givet, Metz, Orleans, and the County Councils of Niort, Valenciennes, Bar le Duc, Nevers, Rennes, d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, Limoges, Rethel, Vire, Grenoble, Saumur Rouen, however, was loud in support of prohibition; the burgesses denounced \u201csecret agents from England.\u201d Roubaix put down the Revolution of 1830 to the fact that the printers were afraid of being deprived of their work by royal decree, and said, \u201cRemember that two risings in Lyons have been caused by reduction of wages.\u201d, 188719=In 1901 the French consumer paid for sugar, native and colonial, more than \u00a34,400,000 of bonuses, bounties, and rebates for export on \u00a36,080,000 worth of sugar., 92314=Liberal policy of 1814\u2014Famine of 1816-1817\u2014The great landowners\u2014The great electors\u2014Maintenance of famine prices\u2014Humblot Conti against the low price of corn\u2014Governmental anarchy\u2014Live stock\u2014The ironmasters\u2014Landed owners against manufacturers\u2014Theory of vested interests\u2014Right to the maintenance of the tariff., 606945=When Mr. Chamberlain has once got hold of an argument he sticks to it, however often it has been refuted. At St. Helens on June 3, 1905, he waxed Edition: current; Page: [221] enthusiastic over the condition of the cotton operatives in protected countries, and expressed the hope of seeing English workers similarly placed. Almost the next day the Report of the Tariff Commission on cotton declared \u201cThat in these countries the conditions of labour are poor and the wages low.\u201d And they count on the lowness of their wages to enable them to compete with England. Inquiries made in connection with the Chamberlain programme have confirmed the following axioms:\u2014, 87837=This scheme was not passed by the National Assembly. Its proposer, who had at least the merit of not being infatuated by his ideas, brought forward another scheme containing only one prohibition of importance, that on new or old ships; other duties being fixed at from 5 to 15 per cent. This tariff, dated March 15, 1791, was the most liberal passed in France down to 1860., 160558=The National Bimetallic League was founded on March 25, 1895, with the Cashier of the Bank of France as its treasurer, and it summoned a preliminary meeting of the English and German leagues for December 10, 1895. The resolutions then passed led to a discussion in the House on March 17, 1896. M. M\u00e9line laid a projected resolution on the table which was signed by 348 members out of 581; but in the Chamber of Commerce the discussion went against him, the resolution not being so much as considered. In 1897, when McKinley sent envoys to Europe to consider the possibility of summoning an international conference, the bimetallists thought that their case was won. But at the very time of the arrival of the envoys from France in England, silver, by a curious coincidence, fell to 2s. in the Edition: current; Page: [50] London market, while the price of wheat in Paris rose to 30 francs\u2014a convincing proof that the fall in the price of wheat did not depend on a fall in the price of silver. On the refusal of the English Government, the American envoys did not trouble to go to Germany, and it was left for M. M\u00e9line and the bimetallists to deplore that English blindness refused to throw overboard half her foreign bills of exchange. The death of bimetallism was celebrated by a dinner in Paris on January 28, 1903, the result of a wager I made with Edmond Th\u00e9ry in 1897; but if England had not saved us, M. M\u00e9line and his friends would have imposed on France the system of silver assignats. In a book called \u201cPrices and the Foreign Exchanges,\u201d M. Jacques Pallain proves, with the aid of irrefutable documents, the absurdity of the contention of the French bimetallists. The example of Spain certainly shows that prices rise in a country where there is very little currency; but they rise not because of the lowness of the currency, but because of the quantity of paper money in the hands of people who distrust their power of converting it into coin., 740358=Germany buys \u00a3560,000 worth of silk from us and sells us \u00a3477,600 worth: probably the quality is not the same in each case, since pure black silks are valued at 38s., and on export at 60s., and cream silk at 54s., and 60s. on export. In clothes and underclothes we export \u00a3758,960 worth and get \u00a3205,800 worth from Germany; and here again it is probable that the same name covers a difference of quality and price. The richer Germany grows the greater will be her demand for our high-class wines and the articles of luxury and elegance in whose production we excel all other nations. In 1887 we sold her \u00a3529,320 worth of silk and \u00a3155,480 worth of clothes and made-up linen goods. Germany\u2019s industrial progress has stimulated, and not repressed, our exportation. The commercial treaties concluded by the German Government with Italy, Belgium, Russia, Roumania, Servia, Switzerland, and Austria Hungary were passed in February, 1905; they take effect in 1906 and terminate on December 31, 1917., 86885=Internal Customs dues were abolished by an order of November 4, 1790, and the question of commercial freedom versus prohibition came up before the Committee of Trade and Agriculture. M. Goulard, member for Lyons, who introduced a scheme, openly avowed himself a prohibitionist. He made all the jokes against the Free Traders which are still in vogue, declaring that one of the best planned and most successful measures of Colbert\u2019s Ministry was the issue of a tariff based not on fiscal considerations, but on the protection and defence of national handicrafts against foreign Edition: current; Page: [8] industry. He proposed a prohibitive duty on all goods which could be made in native factories for consumption, while ready to remove all duties on food and raw materials., 403111=Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s programme may now be spoken of as an historical phenomenon belonging to the past: no one now believes in its success except M. M\u00e9line, and he thought he had invented Colbertism. But Colbertism is old, commercial freedom young. Thus Adam Smith, when he published the \u201cWealth of Nations\u201d in 1776, says: \u201cTo expect, indeed, that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in Great Britain is as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or Utopia should ever be established in it. Not only the prejudices of the public, but, what is much more unconquerable, the Edition: current; Page: [156] private interests of many individuals, irresistibly oppose it. . . . The member of Parliament who supports every proposal for strengthening this monopoly is sure to acquire not only the reputation of understanding trade, but great popularity and influence, with an order of men whose numbers and wealth render them of great importance. If he opposes them, on the contrary, and still more, if he has authority enough to be able to thwart them, neither the most acknowledged probity, nor the highest rank, nor the greatest public services can protect him from the most infamous abuse and detraction, from personal insults, nor sometimes from real danger, arising from the insolent outrage of furious and disappointed monopolists.\u201d, 111832=Under the government of Louis Philippe, there were only 166,000 electors in 1831, 171,000 in 1834, 199,000 in 1837, 201,000 in 1839, 220,000 in 1842., 31114=And there are other elements of comedy in the Protectionist question. A professor of economics at a great American University said to me, \u201cIn America there is not a single professor who is not a Free Trader, but you see how little effect Edition: current; Page: [ix] our teaching has on Congress or the Government.\u201d In England a manifesto in which Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s proposals are confronted with economic truth has been signed by most of the professors in the subject. In Germany, to avoid any such conflict, Schmoller, in his inaugural address as Rector of Berlin University, ordered any professor who set the authority of Adam Smith above that of the Imperial rescripts of 1880 and 1890 to resign his chair. In France, M. M\u00e9line threatened professors who thought it their duty to teach the truth with the rigours of the law; but he has never taken up my challenge to him to formulate the doctrines which they are to teach. Indeed, Protectionists so seldom define what they mean by Protection, that I must borrow from a Protectionist journal published in Philadelphia\u2014The American, of August 7, 1884: \u201cThe object of a protective duty is to divert a portion of the labour and capital of the population out of its natural channels into those favoured or created by the law.\u201d That is, the aim of Protection is to substitute the will of the Government for that of the individual in the direction of his private affairs, by granting privileges to industries favoured by powerful influence at the expense of the unprivileged and those which only ask for freedom., 275868=Every year from 1900-1903 France has imported about 12,000,000 tons of coal, 6,800,000 coming from England. The duty of 1s. per ton on coal affects all the industries which use it. The result of the close connection between the clothing and textile trades, between the manufacture of iron and steel goods and the mining industry, between the manufacture of leather goods and the tanning trade, is that all these trades, employing a large number of hands, trades in which labour is relatively the most important element in the value of the product, are affected by the protective duties obtained by the industries supplying their raw material, industries which represent a much smaller number of workmen, and are for the most part concentrated in the hands of a few big firms. Our inquiry enables us to say that from the point of view of consumers and of the makers of semi-manufactured goods Protection means the profit of a few at the expense of everybody; it is at the same time clear that it leads to over-production and unemployment and organises commercial crises., 298831=The Agricultural Inquiry of 1892 gives Eure-et-Loire with a production of 2,491 bushels for 100 inhabitants as the department in which the proportion of corn grown is greatest relatively to the population. 2,491 bushels = 1,560 cwt.; allowing for the fact that only 75 per cent. of the population needs the ration of 26 ozs. of bread per day, 1,750 cwt. for 100 inhabitants. The standard ration allows 790 lbs. per head per year; this allowance, therefore, at 1,925 lbs. per head per year, gives an excess of 1,133 lbs. Going through the same calculation for the other departments, we find that any district producing less than 9 bushels per head must either have too little food or else import it from other departments, and half the departments\u201443 out of 87\u2014are in this position., 690629=When Bismarck tried to stamp out Socialism in 1879, he attempted to do it by imposing Customs duties which acted as a hothouse for industry, and spread Socialism far and wide; the logical completion of this delightfully illogical policy was the establishment of the Imperial Insurance Bureau as a soothing poultice in the form of bureaucratic Socialism, under whose application he imagined that the Social Democrats would melt away., 117243=Corn Laws in England\u2014Free Trade Movement from 1820\u2014Act of 1846\u2014Progressive reduction\u2014Moderation of Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s proposals\u2014Purification of the tariff\u2014High and low duties in 1840\u2014Michael Chevalier and Cobden\u2014Gladstone\u2014Napoleon III.\u2014Fears of the Protectionists\u2014Treaty of January 23, 1860\u2014Reciprocal freedom\u2014Other treaties\u2014Most favoured nation clause\u2014Spontaneous reduction in England\u2014Commercial treaties are hand-rails., 448073=The Economist of May 26, 1905, gives the following statistics showing the position of 12 iron and steel factories in 1903-4 and 1904-5:\u2014, 408865=The details of this movement had been little followed in England. Two speeches made on May 16, 1903, by Mr. Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain came as a thunderbolt., 569897=The Canadian Customs returns put down to England\u2019s account all that is sent there; the English figures only count what comes in, and the difference is considerable. According to Canadian returns, it sent in 1904 \u00a34,714,000 worth of wheat; the English returns reduce the total to \u00a33,787,000. The English figures for Canadian imports in 1904 are\u2014, 221739=Colbert, indeed, expounded and applied the theory which bears his name, but he applied it with moderation. Even in the tariff of 1667, which cost France a war with the Low Countries, there were no prohibitions, and the duty on iron and other necessaries was only 1s. the thousand pounds. The tariff of 1791 was very liberal, with the exception of certain prohibitive clauses\u2014for example, that applying to foreign-built vessels hitherto admitted free, and even encouraged by bounties., 409367=Mr. Balfour merely suggested that England might have recourse to a policy of Retaliation; Mr. Chamberlain went much further. It is not necessary to go into the details of the policy which he unfolded in Glasgow on October 6, 1903, and Greenock on October 7th\u2014it is too well known. Its main proposals may be briefly summarised under three heads:\u2014, 36600=While Government is absorbed in Protection and the Church, it has no time for the general interests of the country. England\u2019s strength has lain in her comparative freedom from these preoccupations. In France the Protectionists have persuaded the electorate Edition: current; Page: [xii] that expansion must be sought in colonies acquired and retained at an immense cost; and as a corollary France has had to enter into conflict with England in every quarter of the globe, has had to sacrifice a customer who took 30 per cent. of our exports for the sake of a set of discontented officials or soldiers or poor natives who after twenty-five or thirty years only take 10 per cent. And this policy led to Fashoda. It is high time that those who assume the direction of foreign affairs should know rather more than they do of economics: politics must gradually be more and more directed by economic considerations, but not in the sense of a return to commercial wars, as is held by too many Protectionists who accept this view. For the present I will give one instance of what I mean. While every one is thinking of Morocco, and public opinion in France plays with the notion of the partition of the Austrian Empire and a German occupation of Trieste, the Customs Union of Germany and the Low Countries, mooted in 1900, and a first step to political union, is passed by unnoticed. Holland is the emporium for Germany, Rotterdam is the port for the Rhine, in spite of all attempts to make the united navies go up as far as Cologne or make a port of Emden, where there is never anything but a few dredges and fishing-smacks. The project is supported in two newspapers, the Hague Courant and the Avondpost, though it is dangerous in the last degree to Dutch independence, and in 1901 and 1902 a number of German pamphlets by Messrs. Stubmann, von Hale, and Anton advocated the scheme. Fortunately there are great economic difficulties in Edition: current; Page: [xiii] its way. The Low Countries are Free Trade, and the union would involve the adoption of the German Customs tariff, with free ports like Hamburg and Bremen. It threatens the very existence of Holland as a nation. It can only be saved by an alliance between France and England to support Holland against any attempt on the part of Germany to win it over by bribery or threats, which must be checked by some such fiscal union as I am laying before the House, i.e., \u201cThe abolition by France of surtaxes on extra European goods introduced from a European country and the reduction by England of duties on wines.\u201d, 83942=Turgot tried to break the power of the corporations, and those interested in maintaining them denounced him to the King and the people as an enemy. But Edition: current; Page: [6] in 1776 Adam Smith\u2019s great \u201cWealth of Nations\u201d appeared, of which Buckle declared that there was no book in the world so important. Although Turgot had been overthrown he had left disciples, and one of them, M. de Vergennes, wrote on February 1, 1783, to the French Ambassador in London: \u201cThere is an ancient prejudice that a natural incompatibility exists between the two nations. Every nation must aim at attaining the maximum prosperity for itself, but in so far as such prosperity is exclusive it leads to its own negation. One cannot grow rich when other nations are destitute.\u201d In 1786 he succeeded in concluding a commercial treaty with Pitt, which abolished those prohibitive duties which led to nothing but smuggling. When it was opposed in Parliament, Pitt defended the treaty in terms as valid now as they were then. \u201cIs a good understanding between these two kingdoms so derogatory to our honour that its opprobrium is not removed even by the extension of our trade? . . . I have no hesitation in opposing the opinion, too often expressed, that France is necessarily an irreconcilable foe to England, a doctrine which my understanding rejects as monstrous and impossible.\u201d The Rouen Chamber of Commerce, always Protectionist, protested against the invasion of English goods., 639537=Some one is sure to say, \u201cThat proves that Customs duties improve employment.\u201d Leaving out of account for the moment the effect of the duties in lowering the wages and diminishing the demand for the labour of the workmen, who, though not producing raw materials, are dependent on its producers, although Mr. Atkinson estimates at 100 million dollars the loss caused during this period of the restraint placed by the high prices of steel and iron on the manufacture of high-class goods, the question Edition: current; Page: [239] is, Would there have been no furnaces and no production of steel and iron in America without the duties? During this period the output of Great Britain averaged 7,559,000 tons of 2,000 lbs. The United States\u2019 consumption, 6,000,000 tons, represented more than three-quarters of this total. But England and Germany could not have continued to satisfy the United States\u2019 demands; the price of iron and steel would have risen so high in England as to make the establishment of metal works of their own of the first importance for the States; and arising out of the natural order of things, they would have escaped the intermittent crises caused by the over-production encouraged by high Customs tariffs. Since 1892 the pig-iron trade fluctuated as follows:\u2014, 459590=The Protectionists have made great use of the argument from percentages. The increase in exports has certainly been greater in the United States than in the United Kingdom; and when one is added to one the result is 100 per cent. Very fine results can be deduced, as Mr. Chamberlain has shown, especially when he starts his German figures before 1890, that is, before the Free Towns came into the Zollverein., 610296=England, say the Protectionists, is the dumping-ground of all nations; but the relative proportion of manufactures to total imports gives them the lie. When the French cotton spinners from the Vosges dumped their cottons in Manchester, they did it to their own loss, and they recognised that a repetition of the process would be their ruin. Mr. Chamberlain and his satellites have all repeated Mr. Byng\u2019s dumping theory, but they have either cited no fact or cited them incorrectly. A typical instance\u2014Mr. Alexander F. Acland Hood, Conservative Whip, said at a Unionist meeting at Wellington, at the end of November, 1903: \u201cOne Edition: current; Page: [223] of my friends has done a lot of business in the glass trade. Now in France there is a tariff against him. The State Railways carry glass free from Paris to Calais.\u201d, 195843=The question of import bonds had been raised in connection with that of temporary admission. The landowners had begun by declaring that if the corn duties did not raise prices as much as their promoters had promised the suspension of silver coinage was to blame for it. In 1900 they blamed the temporary admission which allowed millers to re-export wheat imported by means of a Customs\u2019 permit involving repayment of the 2s. 10d. duty. The corn-growing departments of the south produced less, those of the north more, than they could consume; the southern millers imported grain from Odessa without exporting flour; the northern millers exported flour without importing wheat. A certificate of temporary admission only benefited the southern miller in so far as he could sell it to a colleague in the north; and since 1873 it had been necessary for a northern miller who wanted to send flour to London to send first from Dunkirk to Marseilles Edition: current; Page: [69] for a Customs\u2019 permit. A decree of 1897 allowed the sending of permits by post., 272779=But the 1903 Blue Book is not enthusiastic. \u201cExports have increased considerably, and imports diminished to a notable extent, but home consumption is being reduced and prices are falling; to maintain production it is necessary to go abroad for a market.\u201d And these admissions come from the representative of one of the most strongly Protectionist trades in France. Iron and steel are raw materials; their production is controlled by a small number of firms; their consumption is an essential of a great number of different industries. In 1901 M. Millerand, at that time Minister of Commerce, estimated that the bounty granted to those among the thirty-one great firms which produced cast iron, iron, and steel had risen to 33 per cent. of the price of railway carriages, 9 per cent. on carriages and Edition: current; Page: [102] tramways, 6 per cent. on hydraulic machines, 33 per cent. on electric dynamos, from 31/2 to 12 per cent. on spinning and weaving machines, 4 per cent. on printing presses, 6 per cent. on agricultural machines, and more than 50 per cent. on naval works, of which the price was \u00a318 a ton., 130839=Development of cotton-spinning\u2014Funds for the unemployed\u2014Tables from 1859 to 1879\u2014Growth in wealth., 80101=An order of June 29, 1700, constituted a general Board of Trade, to be composed of twelve leading merchants chosen from the great trade centres of the kingdom. Nine from among the memoranda issued in 1701 have been preserved. Only one, that of the Rouen delegate, is in favour of a high restrictive tariff. The deputy from Nantes declares liberty to Edition: current; Page: [4] be the soul and substance of all trade; the deputy from Bordeaux seeks for final causes: \u201cGod has distributed His bounties in order to compel men to love one another. He has willed that the earth should not everywhere produce the same things, in order that its inhabitants should seek out and help one another by interchange of the goods which they severally possess.\u201d The deputy from Lyons declares: \u201cWe must abandon the theory of M. Colbert that France can be independent of the rest of the world. Trade ceases to exist when in return for our commodities and manufactures we only receive coin from abroad.\u201d In an essay on Trade, published in 1734, Melon, a former farm inspector from Bordeaux, said: \u201cDo people imagine that a present is being made to the foreigner when they talk of the danger of sending money out of the country?\u201d Mollien, in his Memoirs, quotes some notes made by Orry, Finance Minister and Royal Treasurer from 1736 to 1745, which contain a complete refutation of the Balance of Trade fallacy:\u2014, 222638=After the Restoration the political necessity for prohibition against England had gone; nevertheless, most of the prohibitions were retained or replaced by prohibitive tariffs. In order to get the duties of 1822 and 1827 passed they were declared to be temporary; in 1828, however, when a Governmental Commission of Inquiry was nominated, they were loudly proclaimed to be vested interests; any modification was denounced as a violation of property granted by the law. A coalition of the industrial and agricultural interests asserted the same claims Edition: current; Page: [81] under the Government of Louis Philippe, in spite of the attempt made by the Ministry, and especially by Count Duch\u00e2tel, to reduce the excessive duties and abolish prohibitions., 753832=Thus in the net increase of trade for 1904, relative to 1903, more than 5/6, or \u00a315,252,000, is accounted for by the increase in the quantity of imports and exports, and less than 1/6, or \u00a32,780,000, by the rise in prices., 809666=Why, then, keep the surtaxes at all? From the revenue point of view they hinder commercial transactions, and therefore cannot be productive. Between Edition: current; Page: [318] 1900-1904 their average yield was \u00a362,080. There is no reason for their maintenance, every reason for their abolition. The future of free zones is bound up with their abolition. Their abolition would mean increased facility in the importation of the raw materials of industry. Finally, since they hamper the shipping industry and carrying trade of Great Britain, their abolition would enable us to negotiate with Great Britain for the reduction of the duties on wines which were raised at the time of the Transvaal war. This is my modest programme of reform. It need not alarm the terrible metal manufacturers, the even more terrible cotton kings; it does not affect the agrarians. I have no longer to face the serried ranks of the sugar-makers, masters since 1869 of a political industry; and all wine-growers ought to be on my side, since it is to their interest to extend the English market for their wines., 267322=Of the 8,166,440 lbs. exported in 1902, 54 per cent. and 56 per cent. of the 8,296,200 lbs. exported in 1903, was composed of cotton mixtures, whose prices were raised and sales restricted by protection to cotton yarn., 202348=which represents an increase of \u00a3106,200,000, or 52 per cent., over the period 1861-1865., 835665=Made for the Commission of Enquiry into Foreign Customs Tariffs, June 19, 1903., 801293=I will now sketch the programme which I should like put in operation next session, one much simpler to realise than that for which I worked between 1897-1902. Indeed, every one told me at the time that I was breaking my head against a stone wall in attacking the sugar question; most of the delegates at the Brussels Conference thought that it would end in nothing, and yet March 5, 1902, crowned it with success., 311516=The 7-franc duty per quintal (i.e., 2s. 10d. per cwt.) represents 12s. 21/2d. per imperial quarter. In 1897, when the harvest failed, the duty had more than its full effect, raising the price from 30s. 2d. to 43s. 9d., i.e., 13s. 7d. On May 4, 1898, M. M\u00e9line was obliged to suspend it\u2014declaring \u201cin a few days prices had risen from 12s. to 13s. 21/2d. and even 13s. 71/2d.\u201d, 731969=I.

At the time of the debate on the Budget of 1819 prices were at famine height. M. Lain\u00e9, in introducing the measure, stated that the price of wheat at Marseilles was 5s. 91/2d. per bushel. The Home Secretary, the Duke of Decazes, abandoning all pretence, openly admitted that \u201cthe scheme had been drawn up solely in the interests of the landlords and the farmers\u201d; and the large proprietors paying \u00a312 got the sliding scale established to maintain the famine prices. By the irony of facts low prices followed, instead of preceding, the tariff. The reaction that followed on the death of the Duc de Berry still further increased the preponderance of the landed interest by giving them cumulative votes in the electoral congress. In order to raise prices still further they forced on the Ministry a new project, which, however, did not satisfy them; M. Humblot Conti went so far as to demand a prohibitive tax on wheat. \u201cCheap corn,\u201d he said, \u201cmakes the labourers idle; labour is dear and difficult to get.\u201d, 76281=In 1650, Colbert at the time assistant to Mazarin, was instructed to discover by what means commercial relations might be renewed between France and England, where, the year before, Charles I. had had his head cut off. In the memorial which he presented on this subject Colbert speaks of trade as \u201ccarrying from one province to another, and to foreign countries, the goods which the people in any place require.\u201d In 1666, however, he formulated in Edition: current; Page: [2] the following words the system which M. M\u00e9line imagines himself to have invented: \u201cIt is advisable by raising duties to keep out articles of foreign manufacture, and to buy French goods rather than foreign ones even when they are rather inferior or more expensive, since the double advantage is secured when money does not go out of the country that it does not grow poorer, and that his Majesty\u2019s subjects make a livelihood by stimulating industry.\u201d He had begun in 1664 by setting up a fairly moderate tariff; but Protectionists have always been hard to satisfy, and in April, 1667, they got the duties on manufactures doubled, i.e., on English and Dutch textiles, wool, and lace, and a duty of 2s. per ton placed on foreign vessels to encourage the French navy. After some fruitless negotiations England retaliated by retroactive duties on wines and brandies. Holland threatened: in 1670 their ambassador submitted a memorandum to Louis XIV. in which, after putting commerce under the care of Providence, he said: \u201cThose who facilitate trade, facilitate national happiness and prosperity; those who impede it, stopping its passage by taxes so heavy as to prohibit traffic in the goods on which they are levied, not only prevent their subjects from enjoying the things which grow elsewhere, but even from selling in exchange for them the things they grow at home. By one stroke they compel people to keep the goods of which they already have too much and prevent their obtaining those that they require.\u201d Such ideas clashed with Colbertism. Holland, therefore, placed prohibitive duties on wine brandies, and very heavy ones on French silks Edition: current; Page: [3] and other manufactured goods. France retaliated by again raising the duties on herrings and groceries imported from Holland and prohibiting the export of brandies in Dutch vessels. This led to the war of 1672. Six years later, at the peace of Nymeguen, Holland enforced a return to the tariff of 1664. When hostilities broke out again in 1668, Louis XIV. reimposed the tariff of 1667, but the Peace of Riswyck in 1697 restored the tariff of 1664, which, slightly modified, formed that of 1699. At the end of the War of Succession, which, breaking out in 1702, was likewise a commercial war, England and Holland, in the Peace of Utrecht, revived the 1664 tariff, but the English Parliament threw out the Bill and the tariff applied to Holland only. Colbertism had thus produced one result\u2014war with Holland., 741426=The Protectionist crisis in Germany has not gone beyond the creation of commercial treaties; it changed the spirit of Caprivi\u2019s policy while preserving his methods. It would have been interesting if Mr. Noel, in his historical sketch of German commercial progress, had shown the development of the Franco-German exchanges: he would then have seen that neither nation had any reason to complain of that eleventh clause of the Frankfort Treaty which imposed on each \u201ca system of reciprocity on the basis of the most favoured nation clause.\u201d The Paris Edition: current; Page: [280] Chamber of Commerce observed that this article only took into account six nations\u2014England, Belgium, the Low Countries, Switzerland, Austria, and Russia\u2014while Germany apparently extended it to cover more than 40: a horrible misfortune indeed!\u2014including San Marino and Hawai; and that if Germany extended most favoured nation treatment to 34 nations over and above the six cited in the Frankfort Treaty, France would find herself in a position of inferiority. In proof of this the arrangement concluded between Germany and the United States on July 10, 1900, was brought forward. Certainly the United States was not included in Clause 11, but Clause 1 declares that Germany concedes to them the reduced duties granted to the nations enumerated in Clause 11. Mr. Noel calls the \u201cattention of the authorities\u201d to the tariff of the new treaty. Why? The new tariff might affect French fruit\u2014that would certainly be annoying; but what use would there be in our attacking German fruit, which does not come into France? The new tariffs threatened our wines. Mr. Noel spoke of the arrangement concluded between Germany and Spain. That is all very well, but are we to imitate Spain in offering something to Germany? He proposes to retaliate by an increased duty on leather; apparently we are too well shod. We are free, of course, to make any tariffs we like, since we are not bound by the commercial treaties; but does Mr. Noel think that this sort of teasing policy is likely to open German and other markets? while it would affect all our international relations through the most favoured nation clause, which by an extraordinary piece of good fortune was inserted in Edition: current; Page: [281] the Frankfort Treaty by Bismarck and Pouyer-Quertier, without their foreseeing any of its results. No French Foreign Minister would ever dream of demanding any modification of Clause 11 as long as the treaty stands\u2014the reason it is surely needless to state., 625162=The question of Protection is not purely economic in the United States or anywhere else: it is always confused by fiscal and political considerations. The first tariff was established in 1789 to ensure the revenue of the Federal Government, although the preamble mentions, among other objects which it had in view, \u201cencouragement and protection to manufacture.\u201d The average duty was 5 per cent. ad valorem. The theory of Protection was created by Hamilton in his report on manufactures in 1792, but had no immediate effect. In 1808 the Embargo Act forbade American vessels to engage in foreign trade, or foreign vessels to carry cargoes to the United States. In Edition: current; Page: [230] 1809 it was superseded by the Non-intercourse Act, applying solely to England and France. In 1812 war broke out between the States and England. In the midst of these alarms cotton and linen manufactories and hardware factories were established. They had not waited for Protection, but in proportion as they grew stronger they demanded it more and more loudly., 627619=The first revision after the war took place in 1883. The Budget of 1879 showed a surplus of Edition: current; Page: [231] $100,000,000, and tariff revision was undertaken in order to reduce the revenue. The Commission nominated in 1882 for that purpose was Protectionist: the duties on cheap materials were lowered, but that on wool was maintained; the duties on cheap cotton fabrics were reduced; the duty on pig-iron lowered from $7 to $6.72 (29s. 2d. to 28s. 11/2d.), that on steel rails from $28 to $17 (116s. 8d. to 80s. 10d.) per ton. There was no change in the duties on agricultural produce. The tariff of 1882 cannot be characterised as embodying any general policy. The majority of the Democratic party tried to obtain a reduction of duties, and the elections of 1888 were fought on the tariff issue. The Republicans came in and passed the McKinley Tariff Act of 1890. The duties on woollen cloth, lowered in 1883, were raised, and the number of taxable articles increased; duties on cottons were raised. The duty on linen cloth was raised from 35 to 50 per cent., on lace from 30 to 60 per cent.; that of 50 per cent. on silk was maintained unchanged. The duty on pig-iron was not raised, and that on steel rails was reduced by $13.44 (56s. 2d.). The McKinley Tariff revived the 1828 system of minimum assessments and minimum duties, so as to avoid ad valorem duties, while making the tariff proportionate to the value of the articles. It was not successful, however, in avoiding them, for the foreign exporter sent goods whose price was just on the minimum, and the importer lowered his price just below it. The complicated nature of the tariff concealed the real relation of the duties to the value of the goods on which they were levied. It was put in operation in October, 1890; by November the Democratic party got Cleveland in Edition: current; Page: [232] as President, and won 236 seats against 88 in the House of Representatives. In the Senate, however, there was a Republican majority of 47 to 39, and even after the 1893 elections the Democrats were only 44 to 38. In 1893, in spite of the views of the Democratic party which had elected him, Mr. Cleveland put an end to the purchase of silver (repealed the Sherman Act), and the Committee of Ways and Means, under the presidency of Mr. Wilson, drew up an amended tariff. Several duties were suppressed, and a general reduction effected, but the policy of Protection was not abandoned. The scheme was passed by the Chamber on February 1st: violently attacked in the Senate, where various amendments were introduced which the Chamber finally accepted. The duty on wool was abolished, and this entailed important modifications of the duties on woollen cloth. The ad valorem duties were reimposed, but for most textiles the changes were unimportant. The duty on pig-iron fell from $6.72 to $4 (28s. 11/2d. to 16s. 8d.); that on steel rails from $13.44 to $7.84 (56s. 2d. to 32s. 6d.). The duty on sugar, abolished by the McKinley Tariff, was restored in the form of a 40 per cent. ad valorem duty, equivalent to 2d. a lb., with an additional tax of 1/4d. per lb. on refined sugars and of \u2155d. on bounty-fed German sugars. If the scale of duties was lower than the McKinley Tariff it was higher than that of 1883. Public opinion, looking to each new Act for a radical change of system, was disappointed. The Protectionists created the theory of retro-active responsibility and blamed the new tariff, put in operation in August, 1894, for the 1893 crisis, whose effects had not immediately ceased to be felt., 223552=Napoleon III. only succeeded in defeating the insolent Protectionist coalitions by using his constitutional right of making commercial treaties to conclude an international agreement against them. But after an experience of twenty years of complete success, the democratic Republic, based on manhood suffrage, returned to a Customs system more rigid than that of Colbert\u2014a system which placed heavy duties on food. This was the policy of the great landowners with their cumulative vote and the 200,000 copyholders\u2014and the democratic Republic took it over as the inheritance of the revenge of the \u00e9migr\u00e9s and the feudatories of the July Government, with their traditional privileges. A majority of the eleven million French voters enthusiastically returned candidates who, if they were courageous enough to express, and intelligent enough to understand what they were doing, ought to have said to them, \u201cWe promise to increase your burdens by making you pay taxes on necessaries and private imposts which are to go into the pockets of the Restoration Legitimists, the descendants of the great manufacturers of the time of Louis Philippe, these political adversaries whom you would not dream of electing\u2014and rightly not. But give us seats in the Palais Bourbon or in the Luxembourg, and we promise to put in force a fiscal system which will give them the biggest revenue and the largest profit at your expense.\u201d If hardly this language, yet the policy which it represented Edition: current; Page: [82] was acclaimed by peasants, whether proprietors or not, by workmen, even in the great cities, even by the most impassioned assailants of every form of property among the socialists; this was the policy which they sent a majority to the Senate and Chamber to execute. And yet, taken individually, these men were ready enough to look after their own interests; they knew how to measure their own advantage when immediately presented to them; they like to buy cheap; they were passionately devoted to freedom. How, then, did they come to support a fiscal policy opposed to these interests, opinions, and ideals? It was because, being full of prejudices, the outcome of their ignorance of economics, they were skilfully exploited by people whose interest was to deceive them., 82847=Gournay, a retired merchant, Quesnay, and the Physiocrats uttered the formulas, \u201cLaissez faire, laissez passer\u201d; \u201cAs much competition as possible\u201d; \u201cThe merchants of other countries are the right people for us to trade with.\u201d Mercier la Rivi\u00e8re asked those who talked about the Balance of Trade what would happen to a nation fortunate enough to exchange all its raw material and all its foodstuff for money. The edict of 1764 on the corn trade showed that, thanks to the economists, some progress had been effected; and in 1774, Turgot, who had laid down the lines of his programme in a panegyric of Gournay uttered in 1759, was made Controller-General of Finance. He said in the preceding year, in a letter to the Abb\u00e9 Terray: \u201cThose who carry on trade always try to rid themselves of competition; they always produce some sophistical arguments to prove that it is to the interest of the State to rid them at least of foreign competition, which they have no difficulty in representing as the enemy of national trade.\u201d, 731064=Mr. Chamberlain threatened a downfall for English industry like that of the Campanile in Venice\u2014an inapplicable comparison, for while the fabric of English trade, without Cartels or export bounties, stands firm in a position which can be gauged by the market returns, that of Germany shows cracks, at times like the crisis of 1902-1903, which foreshadow a fate like that of the Campanile for an artificial trade, not resting upon solid foundations, but founded upon piles., 158591=In 1894 M. Edmond Th\u00e9ry published a book called the \u201cCurrency Crisis.\u201d In it he declared that \u201ca crisis in the foreign credit market, a rise in the rate of exchange, is favourable to the country in which it takes place,\u201d and this became an article of faith in the creed of those bimetallists who involved the Spanish and the Mexican bogeys. They proposed a tariff which should vary with the rate of exchange to protect France against the bounties given to Spanish exporters by the depreciation of their currency. The landed and farming interest, and even thoughtful men, in their own opinion able, and indeed accustomed, to reason, men who despised what they would call adventurers or Bohemians, declared solemnly\u2014and men who stood high in business and politics agreed with them\u2014that a country grows rich in proportion as the inferiority of its currency gives a greater or less bounty to its exports. The system of assignats is ideal. In 1894 the Agricultural Society Edition: current; Page: [49] of France, whose members were as a matter of fact rich proprietors who let out their estates instead of working them themselves, issued a memoir in favour of bimetallism. Their action was imitated by the French Association of Agriculture and Industry, a society dedicated to Protectionist propaganda, and the Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture. These three societies, in February, 1895, approached the Government with a view to the creation of an international agreement for the following objects: (i.) The establishment of a fixed ratio between the standards; (ii.) free coinage of silver by every national mint. Should this attempt fail, the Agricultural Society \u201cdrew the attention of the French Government to the possible economic consequences for France of a return to the free coinage of silver.\u201d, 811779=Diminution in Quantity\u2014Exports of cheap wines in the last five years\u2014Export to England\u2014Comparison of two quinquennial periods\u2014Loss on the second\u2014The 1899 duties\u2014\u201cReduction of the English duties on wines in return for the abolition of the surtaxes on extra European goods imported from a European country., 125480=Thiers attempts Protection\u2014Sixty-two Chambers of Commerce to fourteen vote for Free Trade\u2014Projected tariff of April, 1877\u2014May 16\u2014Twenty-four per cent. increase\u2014Fiscal triumph of the defeated party., 376979=The diet of the French soldier has been taken as the standard. Allowing for waste it is a good deal below Atwater\u2019s estimate of the necessary diet for an adult occupied in moderately active work, nevertheless it is among the highest. Although French army bread is only made of meal containing 29 per cent. of chaff, it stands first among the military rations of the world, containing 14\u00b769 of azotic matter to 7\u00b720 in the Prussian army bread. The meat ration is about 13 oz. in England, about 12 in Germany, and 101/2 in France; but in Austria it is only 67/9 oz., in Italy and Russia 71/9, in Belgium 88/9, and in Sweden 93/6. Since humanity has survived and developed on a diet much below that established physiologically by Atwater, or empirically in the case of the French Edition: current; Page: [144] soldier, neither can be assumed as absolutely necessary. But neither the Neapolitan lazzarone who lies in the sun and feeds on a slice of melon, or the Russian moujik sleeping on his stove in winter and satisfied with some cabbages and cucumber cooked in pickle, is capable of effort. At any particular moment an underfed man may make an effort, but he cannot sustain it for long. The Kabyle is sober and a hard worker, but all over Algeria they say, \u201cYou can tell the mark of a Frenchman\u2019s ploughshare from that of a Kabyle.\u201d Teachers of the young, moralists who assume the direction of others without always being able to direct themselves, are always praising temperance, and that to men who have not food enough for their physical needs; talking of the dignity of labour to men with empty stomachs. It would be just as reasonable to expect an engine to move without coal. They might think of the letter Marshal St. Arnaud wrote to Ducos, the Naval Minister, at the end of April, 1854, \u201cThere is no coal anywhere; Ducos orders us to stoke with the sailors\u2019 patriotism!\u201d1, 216378=I have sometimes heard Free Traders of the passive, non-resisting type regret that the treaty of 1860 was ever signed; it seemed to them that an Act of such unusual authority directed against the Protectionists was passed in advance of public opinion, and therefore provoked reaction. I am not a Free Trader of the Buddhistic type; I did not hesitate to join issue with my friends of the Cobden Club when it was necessary to oppose bounties given to Continental sugars by countervailing duties. The Brussels Convention demolished the stronghold of the worst form of Protection\u2014aggressive Protection, as M. Smet de Naeyer has so aptly qualified it; and the efforts to rebuild it could not restore its lost strength and stability. The effect of experience in human affairs is not the same as in a laboratory: it always modifies things so that no reconstruction can restore them exactly to their original form. And so with Edition: current; Page: [77] the 1860 treaties. In Europe their effects were profoundly felt for twenty years; in France they so transformed public opinion that the Protectionists were driven to the base subterfuges I have described in the attempt to win it again to their side, without succeeding, in spite of all their efforts, in re-establishing a r\u00e9gime such as had existed before the treaty. Before the treaty the following articles were absolutely prohibited in France: Woollen and cotton thread and textiles, linen textiles embroidered in cotton, hair thread and cloth (with the exception of cashmere shawls and scarves), ready-made clothes, prepared hides, manufactured goods in skin or leather, plated metal, cutlery, manufactured metal goods, cast iron in pieces of less than 32 lbs. in weight, wrought iron, polished brass wire, refined sugar, unscented soap, dye-wood extracts, madder, all chemicals not specifically excepted, rough earthenware and fine stoneware, glass and crystal, foreign molasses, powdered curcuma, patent medicines not specifically excepted, extract of quinine, ground chicory, goods made of hair or cork, carriages on springs, seagoing ships, and fancy turned goods. In not one of these cases was the prohibition re-established., 637236=To prove the inherent virtue of Protection it must be proved that increased consumption is due to it. The tariff could not have assisted railway development; by raising the selling price it rather restrained it, otherwise for the same cost more lines could have been laid and heavier rails. Protective duties can only increase consumption at the cost of over-production, which sends prices down, as has been the case at crises in American commercial history, when capital is wasted and loses its purchasing powers. Its normal effect is not to encourage but to diminish consumption by reducing the purchasing power of buyers in compelling them to pay 20, 30, 50 per cent. for the things they need above their natural prices. It is a mistake to attribute the increased consumption of iron and steel in America to the Customs duties, which have rather hindered than helped it. Mr. David A. Wells, a former Revenue Edition: current; Page: [238] Commissioner, responsible for the Civil War Settlement, deals in his work, \u201cRecent Economic Changes,\u201d with the position of the American metal trade between 1878-1887: \u201cThe world\u2019s average annual production of pig-iron was, in round numbers, 20,800,000 net tons of 2,000 lbs. each; the average product of the United States was 4,758,000 tons. The average annual import was 1,100,000, to which 225,000 net tons may be added for machinery, hardware, &c. The aggregate excess of cost of iron and steel in these ten years to the consumers of the United States above that paid in Great Britain was 560 million dollars, an average of 56 million dollars a year; for the single year 1887 the disparity in price for the United States was 80 million dollars, while the revenue derived for that year was only 20,783,000 dollars. According to the 1880 census, 300,000 workmen were employed in iron and steel plants at an average wage of 400 dollars a year (about 30s. per week), making a total of 120 million dollars, on which the United States paid 80 million excess.\u201d1, 114909=At this time the Empire was practically a dictatorship; the legislative body, composed of candidates for office, was dumb. So soon, however, as 1856 it ventured to resist the Emperor by nominating a Protectionist Commission. This did not check him; in a scheme issued June, 1856, he proposed the repeal of all prohibitions. In defiance of articles 471 and 472 of the Penal Code the Protectionists had a central committee in Paris, connected with local branches. Roubaix, as violent as in 1834, declared that without prohibition the working classes would be reduced to misery and beggary. Duties of 30 to 40 per cent. did not satisfy the manufacturers. They threatened to provoke risings by closing their factories. The Government scheme had to be withdrawn., 833437=La R\u00e9forme \u00c9conomique, June 26, 1904., 484781=Between 1898 and 1902 the United States were the chief source of our food supply. Mr. Chamberlain and his friends denounced this invasion by American corn, and demanded that the English market should be reserved for Canadian wheat. But since 1904, almost the day after Mr. Chamberlain and the other agrarians were thundering against the American Peril, the imports from the States fell from 60 to 15 per cent. of the whole. In 1904 the United Kingdom imported 118,000,000 cwt. of foodstuffs, of which the U.S.A. were only responsible for 18,500,000; their place was taken by India with 25,500,000 cwt.; Russia with 23,700,000, and Argentina with 21,800,000., 758756=There is a constant confusion between specific trade and general trade. The returns for general trade in France include the export of \u00a3445,360 worth of pearls, those for specific trade the export of \u00a3441,576 but pearls are not a national product; the word is not found at all in the Belgian list. In France the word \u201cdiamond\u201d is not in the list, nor are diamonds included under the head of jewellery; apparently France neither imports nor exports diamonds. However, there is a note to the Belgian commercial return which explains the position: \u201cThe excessive value of diamonds in proportion to their small weight allows them to be imported and exported without the cognisance of the Customs House officer. . . . As a matter of fact the Antwerp merchants imported some \u00a33,200,000 worth of uncut diamonds in 1905 and exported some \u00a33,400,000 worth of cut stones.\u201d, 586526=In regard to France, Mr. Balfour is mistaken on a matter of fact. He estimates that English imports pay on an average 30 per cent.: here he is confusing the maximum and minimum tariffs. In return for her policy of the open door England receives most favoured nation treatment; and in 1902, the year which Mr. Balfour takes as the basis of his calculations, our exports to France were assessed by the English Customs House at \u00a315,587,000, and by the Edition: current; Page: [213] French at \u00a322,680,000\u2014the duty amounted to 9 per cent. on the English and less than 61/2 per cent. on the French assessment., 642732=Pig-iron rose from $12 to $24 per metric ton from 1900-1903, and steel from $16 to $35. Production, encouraged beyond bounds by Protection, had to be restricted: from 415,400 tons a week in June, 1904, Edition: current; Page: [240] it fell to 250,000 in December; in summer the price of iron fell to $12\u00b775 and steel bars to $19. Later, when the price rose again to $28, large orders were made by the railway companies, and the weekly output again increased to 375,000 tons. In 1902 and 1903 even this supply did not meet the demand. America imported 158,000 tons from England and Germany in 1902, and 956,000 in 1903. The United States\u2019 consumption was 18,000,000 tons in 1902, and 18,700,000 in 1903; that of England being 7,875,000, Germany 9,758,000 tons, France 2,749,000, Russia 2,457,000\u2014thus equal to England and Germany together., 93512=Between 1816-1817 there was a famine. M. Voyer Edition: current; Page: [12] d\u2019Argenson describes its effects when he says that he collected in his herbal twenty-two different species of plant used as food by the people of the Vosges, who, taught by old traditions, pulled them up in the fields., 424007=Thus the value of the exports of textile manufactures is \u00a335,000,000, or 43\u00b77 per cent. above the value of the raw materials, a figure which is far from representing the difference in value between the materials and the manufactures, since the forty-one million inhabitants of the United Kingdom keep part for their own use. Between 1886 and 1905 there is an increase of \u00a3229,000,000 in the consumption of raw cotton; but had there been no increase, had there even been a diminution in the consumption of raw cotton, that would not prove that the cotton industry was therefore on the verge of that abyss which Mr. Chamberlain describes. Since 1874 the speed of the spindles has continually augmented, and thus produces finer and finer thread, requiring less and less raw material in proportion to the length produced. In England the consumption of cotton is 33 to 34 lbs. per spindle to 65 abroad., 218789=Sulphuric acid at 6s. 5d. was protected by a duty of 16s. 5d., and is now free; nitric acid at 19s. 2d., with a duty of 36s., is taxed on the maximum tariff at 1s. and is free on the minimum; hydrochloric acid at 3s. 7d. paid 24s. 10d. duty; it now pays 11/2d. on the general tariff and is free on the minimum. Raw cotton, raw wool, linen, hemp, and raw silk are now duty free, and the French agrarians Edition: current; Page: [78] have not succeeded in reimposing the 3s. 7d. duty on wheat and the sliding scale which existed before 1861., 402728=Adam Smith\u2019s pessimistic forecast\u2014No Free Traders without exception\u2014Influence of the economic reaction abroad\u2014Fair Trade\u2014Commission on trade depression\u2014Two reports\u2014Optimism of the Cobden Club\u2014Made in Germany\u2014Protectionist campaigns\u2014Memoranda of the Board of Trade\u2014Colonial Conference of 1902., 311987=On May 1, 1903, the price of wheat was 20s.

(15\u00b794) in New York. The difference between London and Paris was, therefore, 6s. 10d. instead of 5s. 61/2d.

But there are some goods which French ships will not carry. The following instance is taken from the 1900 Minutes of the French Chamber of Commerce in London:\u2014, 324075=The average price of meat at the Vilette market on August 1, from 1900-1904, taking an average of the three qualities, was as follows:\u2014, 313351=I am aware that in 1887, when the duty on corn was 2s. a cwt., M\u00e9line refused to put a tax on bread, stating that the middlemen, i.e., the bakers, would bear the burden of the duty. This involved the supposition that, if the 2s. 10d. duty produced its full effect on the 14,000,000 cwt. on the market, the bakers\u2014small tradesmen for the most part\u2014were to make a present of \u00a319,600,000 to the landowners. If they had been inspired by any such altruistic sentiments, the prospect of bankruptcy would in most cases have prevented their acting upon them. But M. M\u00e9line\u2019s delightful theory was immediately disproved by the action of the Belgian bakers in sending bread to France, and by the French bakers who removed to Belgium. Bread was sent in in tons to an ever-widening circle. M. M\u00e9line had to accept the evidence of his senses and impose a tax on bread equal to that on corn., 449292=The dividends vary for different firms. Bolckow, Vaughan, & Co. have given 5 per cent. for the last 4 years, and the profits for the year ending June 30, 1905, are \u00a3213,000, of which \u00a356,000 goes in increased plant. Guest, Keen, & Nettlefolds gained Edition: current; Page: [171] a net profit of \u00a3337,000 on the year ending June, 1905, and on the preceding year \u00a3333,000, and since its establishment it has paid 10 per cent. dividends., 86234=M.

The export of French woollens fell from \u00a3803,280 to \u00a3203,240; the export of Italian wines from \u00a33,900,160 to \u00a341,720, and of silks from \u00a32,874,000 to \u00a31,691,320. It is easy to close a market, but much more difficult to open it again., 179689=The shipbuilders, for whom the Act of 1893 had been passed, did not need to build for the merchant service; they preferred to serve the Edition: current; Page: [60] Government which paid them highly. In 1898 among the 117 million orders received by the Mediterranean ironworks and shipyards, not a single one applied to the merchant service. If the ships of the companies subventioned for the postal service had not been obliged to be built in France, the effect of the Act of 1893 would have been the complete disappearance of the shipbuilding which it aimed at developing. Speaking on November 9, 1901, M. Guillain declared that out of nine companies which built sea-going ships, three owned 37 out of a total of 67 ships; and for the last twenty years they had executed no private order except for some twenty packet boats, while the other six did almost no building except of sailing ships. When the Merchant Marine Bill of 1902, designed to rearrange the bounty system, was under discussion, the tonnage of sailing ships on the stocks rose between January 1, 1901, and July to 99 vessels, with a gauge of more than 237,438 tons. The Finance Minister, M. Cailloux, calculated in December, 1901, that were the Act of 1893 allowed its full effect until the Bill now before the House became law, the total cost would be \u00a36,000,000 for vessels whose building had cost from \u00a33,600,000 to \u00a34,000,000. Thus the Treasury, by buying and destroying them, would gain some \u00a32,000,000. The Bill of April 7, 1902, which replaced the law of 1893, limited for twelve years the bounties on the construction of the 270,000 tons of steam ships and 90,000 tons of sailing ships contemplated in the Act to \u00a32,000,000 to be expended on a maximum annual construction of 47,260 tons of steam and 114,778 tons of sailing vessels. On Edition: current; Page: [61] January 8, 1903, the Journal Officiel published the names of the vessels on the list, and for twelve years there was to be no building beyond this number. In 1905 the Government introduced a new resolution to correct this anomaly at the expense of the taxpayers. The private iron shipbuilding-yards employed 15,000 men in 1896, and the number was fixed at that. In 1902 France imported 47,857 tons of ships valued at \u00a3505,160, and exported 48,025 valued at \u00a3429,840\u2014old ships, some as old as 1856, most of them of English make and dating 1881-1886. Such are the results of the bounty system in the shipbuilding industry., 203458=and taking the last quinquennial period for which exact figures can be given, we find\u20141899-1903\u2014the annual average to be\u2014, 153722=But the Customs duties were far from producing the effects promised by M\u00e9line and the other Protectionists; facts gave the lie to their prophecies. Encouraged by high protective duties capital had been poured into certain industries with the result of over-production. In spite of the 2s. per hundred-weight on wheat imposed in March, 1887, the price went on falling till 1890, when a bad harvest compelled the reduction of the duty to 1s. 2d. A series of good harvests sent prices down, but the 2s. 10d. duty failed to produce its full effect., 565026=These figures show that the influence of preferential tariffs has been rather to increase Canadian exports to England than English exports to Canada; the former having risen 70 per cent, from 1890-1894 to 1898-1902, whereas the latter have only increased 43 per cent. A glorious result, the Protectionist may say, but his enthusiasm becomes wholly unreasonable when we compare Canada\u2019s imports from Great Britain and the United States in million dollars:\u2014, 711644=Customs statistics worthless up to 1880\u2014Inclusion of the free towns after 1889\u2014Statistics from 1889-1904\u2014Export\u2014Payment of debt\u2014Iron\u2014Imports increase in spite of efforts to restrain them., 309031=In 1894 the duty was 7 francs. Germany lowered her tariff to 3 marks 90. Result:\u2014, 168299=On the morrow of the Franco-Prussian war the reactionary majority in the National Assembly dreamed of repairing military disaster by declaring war on Italy for the re-establishment of the temporal power of the Pope.1 The Republican party made the mistake of combining its anticlerical policy at home with hostility to Italy, and the result was the Triple Alliance, by which his most Catholic Majesty the Emperor of Austria guaranteed keeping the Italian capital at Rome against the secular French Republic\u2014a startling enough paradox. And economic relations followed political ones. On November 15, 1886, the Italian ambassador in Paris declared that the Commercial Treaty of November 3, 1881, must terminate on January 1, 1888. The Italian Government\u2019s proposal of negotiations delayed the final breach till February 2, 1888. On February 28th the French Government levied differential duties on certain Edition: current; Page: [56] Italian goods, and on the 29th the Italian Government retaliated. Surcharges were laid on the navies; and the exchange of goods was replaced by the exchange of reprisals. The effect of this was immediately perceived. The total volume of trade, which had risen in 1887 to \u00a320,000,000, fell in 1888 to \u00a312,000,000. Such a fall was excessive, and in January, 1890, tariff war ended in favour of the application to each country of a general or maximum tariff. In May, 1897, the Italian Government approached the French with a view to the re-establishment of the most favoured nation clause. France excepted silks and wines from the minimum tariff, retaining differential duties on them, and demanded a reduction of the Italian Customs tariff on certain goods. Italy consented, and the agreement was signed on November 21, 1898. The Bill ratifying it was passed almost unanimously in Senate and Chamber by the end of January, 1899., 406587=A series of articles appeared in the Contemporary Review by E. J. Dillon and an anonymous writer called Ogniben, in 1901 and 1902, bearing the burden \u201cof the cry.\u201d \u201cOur agriculture is going down, that of France and Germany is going up; our industry is going down, that of Germany and the States is going up\u201d; and weeping over the decline of the carrying trade. To maintain the impartial character of the Review, however, the Editor asked me to reply to these articles, which I did in July, 1902, replying at the same time to a book on \u201cProtection,\u201d written by a German called Byng, who owned English factories. The sententious arrogance of its arguments was based on the theory of the Balance of Trade, and collapsed when it was touched., 691212=Caprivi, rightly judging that a protective policy which encourages production without providing for commercial expansion naturally leads to crises, pursued the Bismarckian policy in the commercial treaties of 1891, and with success, as the German census returns testify. In 1871 the rural population living in groups of less than 2,000 inhabitants was 64 per cent. and the urban population 36 per cent. of the whole; in 1898 they were equal. Now, whereas the urban population is more than 54 per cent., the rural has fallen to 46 per cent. The division into occupations was as follows, according to the 1896 census:\u2014, 598459=The question of Fiscal Policy was discussed in September, 1903, at the Trades Union Congress at Leicester. A resolution strongly condemning the Chamberlain programme was introduced by Mr. Sexton, of Liverpool, on behalf of the National Dock Labourers, supported by Mr. Holmes, of Cardiff, representing the Railway Servants, and Mr. Michaels, Edition: current; Page: [219] of London, for the Cabdrivers\u2019 Association. This condemnation was not confined to the representatives of the powerful Trades Unions of the Dock Labourers and Railwaymen. The adhesion to the Conservative programme of Mr. Macdonald, the secretary of the London Trades Union Council, gave a momentary encouragement to the Protectionists, which was freely exploited by the Birmingham Tariff Committee. He did not appear at Leicester to defend his views, and they were violently attacked by several speakers, notably by Mr. Harvey, of the Miners\u2019 Federation. With the exception of Mr. Mosses, of Leeds, and one or two other timid speakers, who professed themselves in favour of an inquiry, there was a general recognition of the benefits of Free Trade. Where, but from protected countries, do the poor foreigners come who carry on the sweating system? In what Protectionist country is the workman\u2019s condition as good as in England? In the days of dear bread, wages were 50 per cent. below their present standard, and the price of food has gone down 30 per cent. A national protest against Preferential Tariffs was signed by 960 of the most prominent Trades Union and Co-operative representatives. Twelve out of the thirteen Labour M.P.\u2019s had signed it. The signatures of the officials of the Co-operative Societies represented 2,022,000 members, with a capital of \u00a326,600,000, and a working capital in 1902 of \u00a355,319,000. At the 1905 Trades Union Congress the question was again raised, and the Chamberlain programme thrown out by 1,256,000 to 26,000., 29363=The first two steamers crossed the Atlantic in 1837; in 1842 a Home Industry Convention meeting at New York drew attention to the necessity of protecting Edition: current; Page: [viii] the United States against ocean traffic by steam. When the Saint Gothard Tunnel was opened the South Germans demanded a raising of the tariff to protect them against the influx of Italian goods.1 In 1891 M. Teisserenc de Bort, in the name of the Limousin cattle-breeders, opposed the Havre and Rouen harbour works. All this was logical enough: a Protectionist who spends millions on a port and then builds a tariff wall to close it, and who digs tunnels instead of cutting the railway lines at each frontier, is involved in contradictions which prove the malady of his mind. When the first fire-engine appeared in Japan the carpenters asked to have it removed because it robbed workmen of the employment provided by fires. Bastiat himself never invented anything better., 429255=The Tariff Commission assumes the increase for 1904 to be more than 3,000,000 looms. At this moment 30 new factories are in course of construction, adding 10 per cent. to Lancashire\u2019s productive power. Including these, the increase since 1885 must be some 10,000,000 looms, or 100 factories with 100,000 looms each, representing a capital of about \u00a312,500,000. Moreover, the power of machinery has been continually on the increase for the last 30 years; it is probably twice what it was 25 years ago: assuming it to be only in the proportion of 3 to 2, production must have increased about 40 per cent., 124611=England is the only nation which can have been said to have voluntarily repealed or reduced Customs duties; the others did so only under external pressure. For twenty years the treaty of 1860 preserved France and Europe from economic reaction. One great advantage of a commercial treaty to a country like France is the freedom from Protectionist attacks which it secures for the Government., 449912=Such an industry is not ruined. Germany itself recognised the supreme position of the English steel and iron industries, when, in the three years Rail Syndicate, concluded in 1904 between England, Germany, Belgium, and France, the following share assignment was made on a total of 1,300,000 marks., 100360=As a Protectionist, Count Jaubert admitted later, \u201ceach branch of industry was in a state of recrimination to the others.\u201d In 1828 a majority of the Chamber, in an address to the Throne, declared freedom to be the first essential for trade and industry. In 1828 a Commission of Inquiry of twenty-eight members was appointed, and at once attacked the rights gained by Protectionist duties. \u201cThere are rights wherever there are interests created by the law.\u201d In virtue of this theory the Protectionists could always demand new tariffs and deny the right of Parliament ever to reduce or abolish any., 410936=All Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s arguments are based on the Balance of Trade. In the Glasgow speech he described the growth of imports\u2014which had risen from 63 millions in 1892 to 149 millions in 1902, an increase of 86 millions\u2014as a national danger., 425712=The Free Trade League in Manchester replied to the report of the Tariff Commission on the Cotton Industry. The answer was given in the clearest and most precise form by Mr. S. J. Chapman, Professor of Political Economy at Manchester University, but it was in no sense the work of pure theorists: the men in whose name it was published were for the most part engaged in the cotton trade, men whose object was profit. Had Mr. Chamberlain held out a profit to them they would have accepted it; that they do not enthusiastically accept his presents proves them of little value. Like prudent men they waited to examine his promises before swallowing them greedily. They did not despise economic truth any more than a merchant, anxious to discover his real position, despises accounts; and they were not to be frightened by a few figures such as the diminution in the export of cotton yarn at the end of 1901. In 1901 it fell from 233,000,000 lbs. to 170,000,000; in 1902 to 166,000,000, in 1903 to 151,000,000, and in 1904 to 164,000,000. What a decline! cry the Protectionists, thinking only of the Balance of Trade, as usual. But the question is, Does this decline indicate a decline in the industry? It does not; since there is an increase in the number of looms. All that it does mean is this: in the last few years the price of raw cotton has been very high, rising to 6\u00b703d. per lb. in Edition: current; Page: [164] 1903, and 61/2d. in 1904, an increase which, naturally affecting the price of cotton yarn, has reduced foreign demand. Cotton yarn has become much finer, and thus export can no longer be measured by relative weight but rather by length. The reply to the report estimates the increase in the value of the export of cotton, with respect to quality and fineness, at 7\u00b733 per cent. The export of sewing cotton has increased from 11,600,000 lbs. in 1876-80 to 24,300,000, in the proportion of 100 to 210, but since the cotton has grown increasingly fine weight alone does not give an exact measure of the export. Were the cotton industry declining the number of looms would not have increased., 269853=Has this system led to what is called \u201cdumping\u201d in England, i.e., that sale of goods abroad at very low prices which is made possible by the high prices which a protected industry can command for its products at home? No. Foreign trade in cast iron, iron, and steel only stands twenty-first in the list of exports. Taking the triennial averages, calculated Edition: current; Page: [101] on the three years before the 1892 tariff, and the last three years:\u2014, 700048=Potatoes, difficult to transport, are used for distilling as well as for food; they are grown over 11/2 million acres, an area twice as large as that devoted to them in France. Germany is not self-sufficing. In 1903 the import of agricultural produce was 154 million cwt., worth \u00a351,050,000, and in 1904, 146 million cwt., worth \u00a350,900,000; while the export was only some 20 to 24 million cwt., worth \u00a37,000,000 to \u00a38,000,000; i.e., 14 per cent. of the imports. Mr. Noel said: \u201cGermany\u2019s Edition: current; Page: [264] herds have improved, for imports have declined.\u201d As a matter of fact, there might be many other causes for a decline in the imports, which have, however, as a matter of fact, not declined: between 1892-1902 they increased from \u00a3950,000 to more than \u00a33,650,000., 220358=The experience of the commercial treaty of 1860 entitles one to repeat with even greater force the arguments used by the early members of the Free Trade League and to ask, How does the majority in France come to be Protectionist? How do statesmen in a Republic based upon universal suffrage come to have exchanged a really Liberal fiscal system for one more thoroughly reactionary than that of Colbert or even of Napoleon? From the middle of the seventeenth century down to 1791 duties on food were very moderate; there was no duty on corn and only one of 3s. per head on live stock. Between 1791-1816 wheat and cattle were altogether exempt. It was left for the great capitalist landowners, whose influence was predominant at the Restoration, to establish the sliding scale in order to maintain wheat at the famine prices of 1819 and cattle with a duty of 44s. per head., 33995=One cannot insist too often on the greatness of the work done by England in 1846, when, in basing her Fiscal Policy on science, she brought it into harmony, instead of contradiction, with industrial progress, and thus acquired a start of half a century over other nations. As a result her condition was that of a man in good health whose organs perform their functions without his being aware of it: she became so thoroughly adapted to the benefits of Free Trade as to be hardly conscious of them. It was not until Mr. Chamberlain and his friends threatened her with amputation and mutilation that she realised the advantages of that healthy economic life in which economic competition is not replaced by the lobbying and back-stairs intrigues, the coalitions of corrupt vested interests, the pressure of trusts and cartels, characteristic of political competition., 580974=In January, 1841, Cobden had committed the crime of saying at Manchester, \u201cEurope has been corrupted by the detestable example of England. I believe that if you abolish the Corn Law and establish Free Trade, in five years\u2019 time there will not Edition: current; Page: [210] be a Customs tariff which has not been changed after our example.\u201d, 327140=I am now going to check these results by the information supplied in a Blue Book published in 1902 by the Labour Bureau on Wages Returns, containing the results of an inquiry made among instructed experts as to the monthly board paid by unmarried workmen and the cost of living of families of four., 215475=Thus the Liberal r\u00e9gime, marked by the registration tax of 1860, had not destroyed French corn. In spite of the advance of agricultural science, the harvest of 1874 has never been equalled since., 200534=These results were produced by the silent labour of two economists, who had gradually cancelled some tariffs and modified others, with the result that the annual average of French imports rose \u00a328,600,000, or 41 per cent.; exports \u00a326,800,000, or 35 per cent.\u2014a total increase of \u00a355,440,000, 38 per cent.; results which may well be compared with those noisy enterprises which pretend to find expansion for trade Edition: current; Page: [71] with muskets and cannons. Every advantage is on the side of those who free the natural outlets for trade from the barriers by which they have been shut off. It is hardly necessary to say that the disasters of 1870, the loss of Alsace and Lorraine, did not assist the development of French industry and wealth. During the last quinquennial period\u20141876-1880\u2014following the treaty these are the figures\u2014, 444645=From 1884-1904 the number of cotton-spinning companies rose from 60 to 90; over the whole period, fifteen years, show a gross profit of \u00a32,689,000, six years a gross loss of \u00a3266,786; the net profit, then, for the whole industry is \u00a32,423,000, or \u00a3116,000 a year. An industry in this condition is not ruined., 193391=Estimating the annual consumption at 9,620,000 tons, that is for the two years 17,240,000 tons, there was a surplus in 1900 of 1,116,260. Had the law voted in the Chamber of July 7th come into operation, these 1,166,260 tons would have been exported and the State would have had to pay 1,116,260 \u00d7 55s. = \u00a33,070,000. Two months later it was found that the harvest was 1,000,000 tons below the normal. The State would then have received \u00a32,750,000, and the loss, if it had not been necessary to suspend the duties, would have been reduced to \u00a31,640,000. And the wonderful effect of the law would have been to add a failure in the harvest equivalent to 1,000,000 tons to the 1,116,260 tons whose exportation it had encouraged, and \u00a34,520,000 would have gone into the pockets of skilful traders for having sent corn out of the country and paid nothing to bring it back., 768460=In the summer of 1905 a book appeared called \u201cBack to the Land, and Industrial Over-production,\u201d by M. Jules M\u00e9line; in it, assuming Colbertism to be a new invention, he indulges in some very astonishing statements of a pseudo-historical sort, to the effect that the United States, by suddenly renouncing their former policy of free imports, closed what had been a huge market for European goods, while their exports to Europe continued to increase; and worse than that, having lost America, we are now threatened from Asia: the Yellow Peril is decked out in all its horrible unreality. Indeed, M. M\u00e9line\u2019s interpretation of the \u201ccivilising mission\u201d of Europe in general and France in particular seems to consist in the suppression or holding back of all less civilised nations, and more especially of the Asiatic races. M. M\u00e9line is a melodramatist: that is why he is so successful in France. Regardless of realities he plays upon the people\u2019s appetite for terror, hatred, and fear: he Edition: current; Page: [295] weeps tears over those two poor orphans, national industry and national agriculture, and works himself into a fury of denunciation of the traitors who plot against them, first England, then America, and then Japan., 163488=The founders of the Bimetallic League of 1894, MM. M\u00e9line and Edmond Th\u00e9ry, and the agrarians who followed in their train, declared the more depreciated the currency the larger is the bounty to exporters, the more rapid the development of the country. But all recent experience comes to reinforce the experience of the past, that bad money is not a source of wealth., 266489=In 1892 a duty of 1s. 41/2d. per lb. was placed on thrown silk, the raw material for weaving. The production of silk fabrics was \u00a318,080,000 in 1902, of which \u00a317,760,000 came from Lyons and its neighbourhood; \u00a316,819,000 in 1903, of which Lyons claimed \u00a316,520,000. The export was 8,166,400 lbs. at \u00a38,302,280, of which \u00a33,633,600 worth went to England in 1902; and in 1903 8,296,200 lbs. at \u00a310,030,400, of which England took \u00a35,962,440., 148229=Two tariffs\u2014Law of January 11, 1892\u2014Saving raw materials., 581466=Cobden was mistaken in the date, but not in the effect produced by English policy. If England had not adopted Free Trade the 1860 treaties would never have been signed: they abolished prohibitions which have never been re-established, and lowered duties which have never since been raised to their former height. Mr. Chamberlain blames Cobden and the Free Traders for the non-adoption of Free Trade by other nations, and for the economic reaction since 1879; and demands that England should give it up to punish Cobden and the Free Traders for the fact that all foreign nations have not seen its advantages. Since other nations are loaded with duties which increase the expenditure of effort necessary to everything they produce, Mr. Chamberlain endeavours to induce his countrymen to renounce economy of effort: since other nations have set their Customs system in opposition to that progress in science, industry, commerce, banking which has continuously operated to lower the price of goods and facilitate exchange, to keep down frontiers and Customs tariffs by lowering prices (for example, in the case of chemicals): therefore forsooth England is to give up a fiscal system suited to the processes of industrial evolution., 88247=On February 1, 1793, the Convention declared war on England, and on March 1st it annulled all commercial treaties. Any one introducing, selling, or advertising English goods was punished by twenty years\u2019 penal servitude. Little attention, however, was paid to their orders as long as privateers succeeded in selling their captures. At the time of the discussion of the law of 10th Brumaire year V, it was stated that in the last three years more than \u00a31,600,000 worth of English commodities and manufactured goods had been sold. And the new law, passed to make the prohibition more stringent, was equally ineffective. On June 16, 1801, the First Consul reopened the frontiers to the passage of English goods, and on the advice of Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s, who declared that the last cause of division would then be removed, considered the possibility of a commercial treaty. War, however, broke out in May, 1803. Napoleon tried to renew, on a more extensive scale, the prohibitions of the Convention and the Directory: in the Berlin Decree of Edition: current; Page: [9] November 21, 1806, he forbade any exchange or communication with England; in the Milan Decree of November 23, 1807, he declared any vessel which had touched English soil contraband of war; and in the Decree of the following September he put the British Isles under blockade. Smuggling increased with the increased duties. In the Order of October 8, 1810, he created County Courts which could in the last resort condemn smugglers to ten years\u2019 penal servitude and branding. He himself, however, broke the Continental Blockade by conceding by means of licences the more or less imaginary obligation of exporting an amount equal to the quantity imported; and he dressed the soldiers who were to enforce the blockade on Europe in smuggled cloth. Nevertheless, the Continental Blockade was the main object of his policy. He tried to conquer Spain in 1808 in order to close it against English goods; he invaded Russia in 1812 because it would not accede to the policy which he wished to extend as far as India. When he refused in 1813 to hand over the Hanseatic towns to Austria, it was because of his designs on English trade. He aimed at ruining England. In 1813 he saw that, far from having attained that end, he had extended her markets. The drafts of English business men enabled her to pay her own troops and finance allied powers: they transmitted to their correspondents commodities and manufactures which liquidated the drafts. By 1813 Napoleon realised so clearly that he must abandon the idea of ruining England that, according to M. Thiers, he had issued enough licences \u201cpractically to re-establish Edition: current; Page: [10] trade with England, on which the import dues brought in some \u00a34,000,000. The parts were thus reversed. Whereas two years ago Napoleon had tortured Europe to break off its commercial intercourse with England, England now, seeing the advantage her enemy reaped by licensing trade with her, tried to render it impossible.\u201d, 164506=The Free Trade Movement had been headed by the southern departments of France\u2014the great wine-growing district of Gironde to the west, and H\u00e9rault to the east. When the French wine-harvest was reduced by phylloxera, it was necessary to turn to Spanish and Italian wines. In proportion as the vineyards of the 1,900,000 wine-growers recovered, the exclusion of foreign wines was demanded, and the law of January 11, 1892, placed them on the maximum tariff at a duty of 1s., and on the minimum tariff at 1d. per degree of alcohol for the first 10 degrees, with a Customs duty proportionate to the rise in the consumption of alcohol for each degree over and above. Until the wine-growers began to demand Protection people had imagined that wine only came from Bordeaux. They renounced this traditional monopoly by showing that such good and cheap wines could be got from Spain and Italy that Edition: current; Page: [53] the French growers needed Protection against them. It was strange enough to see the wine-growers of Medoc become fervent believers in Customs duties, nominating an ardent Protectionist as their member; but as a matter of fact it was not Protection but expansion that was needed by the great vineyards of Bordeaux, Ch\u00e2teau Yquem, Haut-Brion, Ch\u00e2teau Margaux, Ch\u00e2teau-Larose, Ch\u00e2teau-Lafitte, &c. At the warehouses they had been in the habit of making an excellent blend of French and Spanish or Italian wines, which commanded a large market in France; when it was suppressed the blending was done at Pasages, in Spain. M\u00e9line had said to the wine-growers, \u201cI will give you Protection; you can then make as much wine and of such quality as you want, and your countrymen will be obliged to drink it.\u201d Acting on this advice the growers of H\u00e9rault and the other southern departments planted a vineyard called Aramon, from which a great quantity of wine was made, containing 4, 5, or 6 degrees of alcohol, which would not keep at all. Formerly the strong wines of the south had been used to enrich the thin wines of the centres; now they needed enriching themselves, and for this purpose some 132 to 198 million gallons were imported annually. A series of abundant harvests caused complaints on every side of the small sale of wine. The south shook, as a contemporary wit declared. But in spite of all the efforts of the Government and the indignant protests of the deputies, the consumption of weak wines that would not keep could not be forced either at home or abroad., 730370=The Syndicate thus failed either to fix prices or keep them to the high standard of 1890., 443395=The export of cotton from the principal Western nations has increased 38 per cent. between 1891-5 and 1901-2; of the total Great Britain claims 62\u00b75 per cent., Germany comes next with 12 per cent. European competition is confined to fancy and new-fashioned goods; that of the United States to coarse or very fine cottons. The population of the neutral countries is so great and their consumption of cotton so small that there is room for a great increase in the export of yarns and textiles., 249033=In the case of women\u2019s garments the lady\u2019s travelling trunk is a secret means of exportation, as was proved at the time of the Exhibitions of 1889 and 1900; in the latter, according to the Custom House returns, although the showrooms had been very busy, the dress exports went down 25 per cent. The export of silk dresses, which had risen considerably, fell 57 per cent. in 1903 on the preceding years; and in 1904 it continued to fall. The rise was not due to Protection, but to an increase in the wealth of other nations which caused an increased expenditure on articles of feminine elegance, which the Parisian shops were better fitted than any others in the world to meet. Then came a change in fashion; perhaps it will change again and the export of silk dresses rise again. But our shops must sell at high prices because all the materials that they use are burdened by Protection. Far from helping, it hampers them; far from raising wages, it lowers them, because in the net cost the share taken by Protection is subtracted from wages., 113534=After the Revolution of 1848 the Socialists followed in the steps of the landed proprietors of the Restoration and the capitalist employers of Louis Philippe, in denouncing competition, and M. Victor Grandin, a manufacturer from the Lower Seine, who had distinguished himself under the late r\u00e9gime by his passionate ardour for Protection, became the spokesman of the Committee of Commerce in the Constituent Assembly. He got the duty on glass raised to 27 per cent. and the import of nankeen in foreign vessels prohibited. In 1850 the Legislative Assembly took the opportunity afforded by the introduction of a liberal bill by Sainte-Beuve to express Protectionist sentiments, Thiers being much less moderate in his views than he had been in 1832 and 1834. After the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat the Emperor aimed at gradually working round to Free Trade. Between 1853 and 1855 Edition: current; Page: [24] M. Magne lowered the duties on coal, cast iron, sheet iron, steel, wool, oil seeds, and dye-woods, and substituted a 10 per cent. duty on live stock, meat, cereals, and wines for the prohibitive duty on foreign-built vessels., 189441=The Brussels Convention was a complete success. It was put in operation September, 1903, and down to the end of August, 1904, the results were: Consumption in France rose from 365,634 tons in 1902-3 to 688,700 tons in refined sugar, i.e., an increase of 83 per cent.; and in Germany raw sugar rose from 366,538 to 729,255 tons, and in Austria-Hungary from 501,977 to 1,109,470 tons., 212489=Thiers had declared in a speech made June 27-8, 1851, that to abolish the sliding scale and the Customs duties, then 3s. 7d. per bushel, would mean that no more seed was sown or corn produced in France; he threatened an inundation of corn from Russia, Naples, and Seville. In 1861 the Customs duty was converted into a registration duty of 21/2d., and the number of acres sown with wheat, which was 14,400,000, rose to 16,560,000 in 1865, 16,800,000 in 1869, and after the war, in 1880, under the same fiscal policy, the acreage remained the same. With the sliding scale in the single year 1857 the harvest had been 303,600,000 bushels. While the duty was only 21/2d. the following are the figures:\u2014, 194325=The chapter of Budget history dedicated to what Edition: current; Page: [67] were paradoxically called import bonds would have been one of permanent deficit, its statistics would have depended on the excess of the selling price in foreign markets increased by 2s. 10d. per cwt. over the buying price in France, including cost of transport, &c. To satisfy the fears of men more far-seeing than themselves the authors of the scheme limited the experiment to 1901-1904. This fine system was supported by M. Viger, former Minister of Agriculture, and opposed by M. Durand Savoyat, of the Bounties Commission, M. Couteaux, an intelligent farmer, and M. Caillaux, Minister of Finance. It was rejected, but I have dealt with it here to show the aberrations to which Protection leads., 35354=In the following pages the absurdity of certain Protectionist propositions will be demonstrated. The insufficiency of the diet of the French population is shown by a comparison with that of the army. I am waiting for some Protectionist to get out of this argument for Free Trade by proposing to reduce the soldier\u2019s ration. In 1904 the value of a ton of French exports was about \u00a317 3s., of imports \u00a37 15s. Taking the value of a ton of imports as \u00a3100, that of exports is \u00a3253. The cheaper we buy, the greater our marginal benefit on selling dear. Protection, by raising the price of imports, tries to reduce this margin; no Protectionist can disprove this.

M. M\u00e9line himself was the first to shake it. The minimum tariff was to be inviolate, but the tariffs of 1892 were hardly established when an agreement had to be concluded with Switzerland, involving a reduction on 55 articles of the minimum tariff. The first agreement was rejected, but the Act of 1895, though only reducing duties on 30 articles, began the work of demolition. M. M\u00e9line, who introduced the measure, admitted that the agreement made a breach in the minimum tariff. For the agreement the existing tariff was used by introducing two Bills\u2014one, numbered 2,339, proposing reductions in the French tariff, the other, 2,338, ratifying the agreement with Switzerland on the basis of the reduced tariff., 197565=According to the Blue Book on Agriculture, the northern and north-western districts produced 268 cwt. of corn for every 100 cwt. produced in the south. The Act of February, 1902, forced the miller to pay duty immediately the wheat was brought in, and prevented his alienating the right of collection, the amount of which would be refunded to him on reexportation. The aim of the landowners was to force the south to buy the wheat it needed exclusively from the north, and thus pay the whole duty, i.e., 2s. 10d. From one point of view this was logical, but it was illogical to lower the price of wheat in the wheat-growing districts by making it impossible for the northern miller to export flour., 86566=De Tocqueville has shown that in the National Assembly of 1789 considerable influence was exercised by the economists, although, according to Du Pont de Nemours, every self-respecting speaker thought it necessary to begin by reviling them., 648837=Thus in 1897 dutiable goods were 50 per cent., the whole more than 58 per cent. in 1901 and 1903, and 54\u00b718 per cent. in 1904\u2014that is, rather more than half the total import. The yield of the duties on food and live stock is higher in proportion than the yield from those on luxuries, since it falls on the necessaries of existence. Up to 1897 raw materials were from 20 to 26 per cent. of the imports, since they have been 32 to 38 per cent., while partly manufactured goods are 9 to 12 per cent., 107695=Nevertheless, Duch\u00e2tel got the Act of 1834 passed, empowering the Government to convert the prohibitions on the following articles into duties: Unbleached cotton thread of high numbers, cashmere shawls, lace made by hand or with a distaff, silk handkerchiefs, new ready-made clothes, naval iron cables, watches and clocks, spun silk, Russia leather, rum, &c. To legalise this measure he drew up a Bill for February 1, 1836, which gave rise to a long Edition: current; Page: [20] debate reopening the whole question of Free Trade versus Protection. Ducos, introducing the Bill, pronounced definitely against the restrictive system, and demanded sweeping reductions of the duties on iron. Thiers opposed him on the ground that \u201cfive miles of railroad would not be made in a year.\u201d M. David, the Director of Customs, opposed temporary importation. \u201cThere has never been any question of admitting prohibited textiles for printing\u2014as, for example, calico and other cotton fabrics.\u201d When the consumption of meat was stated to have diminished, General Bugeaud declared that he preferred an invasion of Cossacks to that of a herd of oxen., 652279=According to the commercial tables for 1904, 308 million dollars\u2019 worth of raw materials were exempt, while 181 million dollars\u2019 worth, i.e., 35 per cent. of the whole, paid a duty of 25 to 30 per cent. Applying this percentage to only a third of the raw materials of industry, there is a tax of over 600 million dollars on the raw materials of the United States; and yet this system is by some strange irony called protective!, 704661=Of course, in Germany, as in France, it is said that the consumer of bread does not feel the Customs dues on corn or flour: but Professor Hirschfeld, in a monograph on the prices paid for flour and rye-bread in Berlin between 1886-1895, and Dr. Paul Mombert, in a book called \u201cThe Annual Burden laid on the Workman by the Corn Taxes,\u201d have proved that the price of the product depends on the price of its raw material. A tax on rye of 35s. per ton takes Edition: current; Page: [265] 4\u00b75 per cent. from the income of a workman\u2019s family of ten, and the figures prove that duties on food are a bounty on small families., 765083=To define the Balance of Indebtedness, the Economic Balance, one must begin by eliminating. It must not be confounded with the wealth of the country: only that part of capital must be taken into account which is used in economic relations with nations in general or certain specified nations; it is found by analysing the gains and losses resulting from the coming into or going out of a country of four classes: (1) Men; (2) merchandise; (3) mineral wealth; (4) incomes and credit. In a work on the Foreign Exchanges, published in 1863, Mr. Goschen stated that the debts of one country to another were the first and most important factor in the determination of the movement of the Exchanges. A German, Adolf S\u00e6tbeer, celebrated for his investigation into the prices of precious metals, replaced the name \u201cBalance of Trade\u201d by that of \u201cBalance of Payments,\u201d which M. Ignaz Gruber has defined in the following terms: \u201cThe arithmetical representation in terms of money of the total of one nation\u2019s economic relations to others in a given period, and the different debit and credit transactions between them, is the determination of the balance.\u201d One could put it more simply: The Economic Balance of a given country at a given time comprises all the payments and promises to pay made or received by it., 489655=Sir Howard Vincent, the incarnation of all Protectionist prejudices, saw how large an area Canada occupies on the map, and on June 23, 1905, he said at the Imperial Industries Club, \u201cCanada could produce 5 million quarters of wheat; it has 20 million acres of virgin soil capable of producing 25 bushels of wheat per acre.\u201d, 236907=The tariff came into operation on February 1, 1892. Passing over this and the following year to allow for the disturbances caused by a change in system, we find:\u2014, 101981=The centre of political gravity had been changed. Since the double vote had been taken from the great landowners, the electoral basis made a property qualification of \u00a38, and the hereditary peerage abolished, the July Government had not to depend exclusively on the landed interest, which was for the most part in the hands of the Legitimists, its worst enemies. In 1834 M. d\u2019Argout, the Minister of Commerce, proposed to modify the sliding scale. His scheme was tentative enough, but the Committee of the House found it too advanced. It was, however, energetically supported by M. de Laborde, the Duke d\u2019Harcourt, and Duvergier de Hauranne, who Edition: current; Page: [17] asked whether the Customs were intended to secure a remunerative price, relative to the cost price of corn, to the owners of good land or bad. The eternal M. de Saint Cricq replied with a political argument which brought the capitalist manufacturers in line with the landed interest, prophesying that the next step to the abandonment of agricultural Protection by the Government would be its removal from every sort of manufactured product. The effect of this statement was heightened by a remark made by Count Duch\u00e2tel to a deputation of cloth manufacturers from Elb\u0153uf in 1832: \u201cThe object of the Revolution was the destruction of privilege; you must accustom yourselves to the idea that the destruction of the privileges that protect you is only an affair of time: they cannot shelter you for ever.\u201d Certainly neither d\u2019Argout, Minister of Commerce in 1830, nor Thiers in 1832, nor Duch\u00e2tel in 1834, was a Free Trader; yet each of them perceived the necessity of at least exchanging prohibitive taxes for Customs dues, and the prohibitive for a protective tariff. Their object as members of the Ministry was the furtherance of public interests: They encountered the determined opposition of a coalition of private interests. When M. d\u2019Argout proposed to admit for re-exportation certain prohibited goods, among them plain silk, which had been admitted since 1818, M. Fulchiron cried out, \u201cThat spells ruin for Lyons.\u201d When Paris demanded an emporium, M. Roux, member for Marseilles, cried, \u201cThat is the end of our maritime trade, sacrificed to the insatiable ambition of the capital!\u201d M. Jair threatened a social revolution. However, Edition: current; Page: [18] d\u2019Argout got his Bill passed by 190 votes to 76. The sliding scale set up in 1819 and 1821 ended by creating the most inequitable system possible. The price of corn varied between 6s. per cwt. in Marne and 10s. 9d. in Gard. In October, 1831, d\u2019Argout proposed to repeal prohibition and in every case replace it by graduated duties: to create instead of a crowd of small zones two main divisions, one comprising the sea coast from Dunkirk to Bayonne with a piece of land frontier from the North to the Upper Rhine Department; to replace the hectolitre by a measure of weight; to abolish all taxes on foreign vessels when prices rose very high; and to calculate the scale of duties at the rate of 8s. per cwt. for the first district and 9s. 7d. for the second. But M. Laurence\u2019s amendment reduced the Bill to the level of the Act of 1821. The people of the southern non-corn-growing departments had to endure higher duties to secure for the North a monopoly of their food supply. In September, 1835, the duties stood, according to the scale, at 6s. 7d., 5s., 3s. 1d. per cwt. for the first, third, and fourth classes respectively. In 1847, a year of bad harvests, the sliding scale was suspended, but too late; French buyers had to wait until foreigners had already taken the best. Prices rose to famine height. In February, 1848, the scale was re-established; suspended again from 1853 to 1859; but then the Emperor was obliged to revive the Act of 1832, not finally repealed until 1861. In 1832 the Ministry demanded from Parliament the repeal of prohibitions and the reduction of certain duties. The proposal was not even discussed, but the Government got some of the suggested modifications effected by means of a Edition: current; Page: [19] royal decree, which it was in 1834 proposed to legalise in two Bills. For the decree Thiers was responsible: he entered a protest against prohibition and the aggravation of the tariff. M. Duch\u00e2tel, his successor, was more courageous. He nominated a Commission of Inquiry into prohibitive duties affecting the manufacture of glass, pottery, plated metal goods, wool and cotton textiles., 550911=This is a good example of the sort of exaggeration in which Mr. Chamberlain habitually indulges. The Colonies have never taken \u00a310 per head of our products; in 1904 they took a little over \u00a34 per head, i.e., 60 per cent., less., 452100=A great many foreigners, and even a considerable number of English people, seem to believe that the magnitude of England\u2019s exports is due to coal; and pessimists say that the export of coal enriches the present at the expense of the future by exhausting natural resources; some go so far as to urge that its export should be prevented by raising the export duty 1s. a ton, since the use of English coal by foreign merchant service and factories helps them to compete against the English merchant service and English factories. A comparison of three tables shows how baseless such apprehensions are. The average export of coal, coke, and other fuel was \u00a330,000,000 between 1900 and 1904; the total export, \u00a3289,000,000; and the export of manufactures, \u00a3232,000,000. Therefore, for every \u00a3100-worth of coal exported, England exports \u00a3773-worth of manufactured stuff\u2014a total of \u00a31,000., 595477=Speaking at Newcastle, October 20, 1903, Mr. Chamberlain said, \u201cIn thirty years the total imports of manufactures, which could just as well be made in this country, has increased eighty-six millions, and the total exports have decreased six millions. We have lost ninety-two millions, the balance; that is to say, ninety-two millions of trade that we might have done here has gone to the foreigner. The Board of Trade tells you that you may take one-half of the exports as representing wages. We, therefore, have lost \u00a346,000,000 a year in wages during the thirty years; that would give employment to nearly 600,000 men at 30s. per week, continuous employment that would give a fair subsistence for these men and their families amounting to three million persons.\u201d, 350860=In 1892 the duties on oxen, bullocks, and cows were 4s. the hundredweight on the live weight. There was no minimum tariff. There was a duty of 4s. 10d. on calves, 6s. 3d. on sheep, and 3s. on pigs. There was a duty of 12s. 4d. on mutton, 4s. 10d. on fresh pork, 10s. on salt pork, 12s. on salted beef and other meats. In 1892 MM. M\u00e9line and Viger found these duties high enough, as they certainly were, when, under pretence of sanitary regulations, neither foreign live stock nor meat was admitted at all. In 1903, when a good understanding with Italy had been arrived at, M. Debussy, a member of the House, declared with charming frankness that it would be a good thing to replace the sanitary regulation by a higher duty. \u201cIf Italian live stock came into France the price of native stock would fall to \u00a34 a head, which would involve a loss to French breeders of not less than \u00a328,000,000.\u201d One of the members, M. Fayot, who voted for the duty, urged it upon grounds which ought to have ensured its rejection: \u201c100 lbs. of live weight, in the case of an animal of average quality, give 50 lbs. of meat. Leaving out of account the fifth quarter, worth some \u00a32 to \u00a33 3s. 11d., the tax proposed on the minimum tariff amounts to some 21/2d. per net lb. of meat.\u201d This calculation was confirmed by the tariff which raised the tax to 14s. per cwt. of fresh meat, including bones, and making no distinction for quality. At the time of the discussion on the Bill the breeders charged about \u00a31 12s. per cwt. Edition: current; Page: [132] for live stock: the duty was thus 25 per cent. The tariff of July, 1903, was:\u2014, 152167=The tariff of January 11, 1892, replaced the minimum tariff affecting agricultural produce by a duty of 4s. per hundredweight on live oxen, 6s. on sheep, and 3s. 2d. on pigs, while the duty on fresh beef was 10s., pork 4s. 10d., and mutton 14s. Public health regulations only permitted the importation of mutton in quarters, the entrails attached to one of the forequarters; and thus kept out Hungarian and La Plata mutton. To avoid rousing public opinion, the 1889-1891 Ministry shelved the question of a higher duty on corn, leaving that responsibility to its successor. In 1894 the question came up. The 1893 election had returned some forty Socialists. They behaved strangely enough. With M. Jaur\u00e8s at their head they made it their aim to win over the small peasant proprietor by outbidding the Protectionists in making bread dear for the workmen who had returned them, and whose interests they pretended to represent. A Bill of February 27, 1894, raised the duty to 2s. 10d. per hundredweight. Most of the Protectionists were not satisfied; they declared that farmers must grow their corn at a loss. This is the usual argument; the poor things always work for loss, not gain., 699636=Wheat, which does not grow at all in the north, is a luxury in Germany. For a long time the staple food of Central Europe was oats, now it is rye in Germany, which can be grown on the poor land and bare hillsides which are not fit for wheat, but even of that there is not a sufficient supply. Germany imported 8,800,000 metric tons in 1902-3, and 3 millions tons in 1903-4., 527331=If, however, Mr. Chamberlain did get a tax imposed for the benefit of the great landowners in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, it must be an effective tax, and what could be the effect of one of 2s. a quarter on wheat and 5 per cent. on meat and dairy produce? The advantage which wheat might derive from Protection must not be calculated Edition: current; Page: [191] upon the whole harvest, but only on that on the market. The annual average of wheat put on the market in the United Kingdom between 1900 and 1904 was 2,400,000 quarters; multiplied by 2s. that gives \u00a3240,000. During the same period the average acreage sown with wheat was 1,600,000 acres. If the tariff produced the maximum advantage for the English landowners and farmers they would reap a profit of 3s. per acre. Allowing 3 quarters of wheat for 2 of flour in reckoning breadstuffs or foodstuffs, the average importation over the five years 1900-1904 from the British Colonies and Possessions has been 5,700,000 quarters, representing at 2s. a quarter a yield of \u00a3570,000. From abroad the average import of 17,300,000 quarters, representing \u00a31,730,000. Thus the English consumer would have to pay:\u2014, 79574=In a memorandum on Colbertism, read before the Royal Economic Society of Florence in 1791, Francis Menzotti showed that in order to incline the Balance of Trade in its favour a nation must get money from others by selling to them without buying, by which means it aggrandises its own treasury at their expense. The practical application of Colbertism under Louis XIV. left France nerveless and exhausted; every treaty obliged her to abandon the tariff which had originally provoked the war., 271761=Thus during a period of ten years, in spite of Customs duties, imports rose 309 per cent. in quantity, while exports only rose 12 per cent., including the exceptional year 1902, which raised the annual average to its total export of 376,468 tons. This result, however, the Commission declared to be \u201cdue to a falling off in internal consumption.\u201d, 321058=An increased consumption of animal food is a sign of comfort. If the consumption of meat in the towns has not increased in proportion to the increase in population it is due to the high price of meat, of which the main cause is the Customs duties, which have risen steadily since 1881. In Paris the consumption of butcher\u2019s meat has diminished relative to the population. While the population has increased Edition: current; Page: [122] 33 per cent. between 1880-1903, the consumption has only increased 8 per cent., and the fall from 10 per cent. in 1902 to 8 per cent. in 1903 was largely due to the Customs Act of July, 1903., 188929=I took an active part in the negotiations which resulted in the Brussels Sugar Convention of March 5, 1902. Had England, however, not threatened the sugar-refining nations who should retain their bounties with countervailing duties, the Conference would have ended in nothing, and a fearful sugar crisis would have followed in France, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, and Holland. A manufacture cannot be carried on with impunity which aims at realising bounties rather than sales., 557134=As a matter of fact, comparing 1890 and 1902 there is a diminution in our exports to foreign countries. In 1900 there was a decline of \u00a37,000,000, and in 1902 of \u00a318,000,000. This \u00a318,000,000 was exactly balanced by increased exports to the self-governing Colonies. Foreign countries take 58 per cent., Colonies 42 per cent; consequently the foreign market is still 16 per cent. greater than the colonial. The Report of the Imperial Tariff Committee on the Cotton Industry shows that of \u00a373,300,000 in Edition: current; Page: [201] 1903 and \u00a384,000,000 in 1904, the self-governing Colonies took\u2014, 34897=Truths once acquired cannot be lost: there are abuses whose recurrence experience has made impossible. Edition: current; Page: [xi] Neither Bismarck nor M\u00e9line nor the agrarian party in any country has been able to return to the system of prohibition and taxes on raw materials existing before 1860., 261589=But this export trade with England is to be considered rather as a payment of debts than as a sign of prosperity. The surcharges on cotton goods were so heavy that when the manufacturers tried to extend their sales by sending them to Manchester they lost a day a week. In 1904 a Congress was held at which M. M\u00e9line made two confessions\u2014\u201cIt is sad to have to confess that our exports of cotton tend to diminish, while those of England and Germany increase\u201d; and \u201cIt is true\u201d that the protective duties led to the establishment of new factories. The Congress nominated a permanent committee, empowered to enforce the closing of mills and factories Edition: current; Page: [96] on receipt of an indemnity\u2014but it was not stipulated that this indemnity should be extended to the employ\u00e9s.1 In the article on Cotton in the \u201cDictionary of Commerce,\u201d a manufacturer, M. Gustav Roy, says: \u201cThe Protectionist system must be made responsible for a great part of the considerable difference existing between the price of cotton in France and of the same goods in England; price had to be reckoned plus the addition of interest on capital sunk in the paying of duties (1) on the materials, (2) on the machines and workmen employed\u2014of annual charges necessitated by the Customs dues on the raw material, cotton; and secondly, on all the plant needed for the working of the factory, such as coal, oil, metals, and woods of different kinds, and various other goods; finally, of expenses caused by the bounties paid to certain industries, and of the rise in cost of transport due to the protection given to the merchant service. Moreover, since the sales can only be extended over a strictly limited market, there is a constant need to guard against the danger of over-production.\u201d, 131027=The justification of economic reaction, urged in season and out of season by those who encouraged it, was that France had been ruined by the commercial treaties of 1860, although ten years after their conclusion she had been able to sustain the disasters of the war of 1870. The lamentations of the cotton-spinners were the loudest of all: had they been justified they must have closed their factories and ceased to import raw cotton; as a matter of fact, in spite of the loss of Alsace-Lorraine, importation increased, as the table shows:\u2014, 425118=In June, 1905, the Imperial Tariff Committee, got up by Mr. Chamberlain to prove his case for Protection, Edition: current; Page: [163] published a report on cotton; a few days before it appeared Mr. Chamberlain said at St. Helens, \u201cCotton is stationary\u201d; its report gives statistics to the contrary. In 1892-94 cotton exports rose to \u00a365,400,000; in 1903 to \u00a373,300,000; in 1904 to \u00a383,900,000, an increase of 28 per cent., 250751=The export price of silks was in 1903, plain silk, 27s. 3d. a yard; figured or broch\u00e9, 32s.; mixtures Edition: current; Page: [92] of silk and cotton, 14s. 3d. plain and 16s. 4d. figured. Silk dresses came at \u00a315 11s. 6d; the difference in price is in the style, and the greater part of this difference between cost of material and cost of the finished garment goes in wages., 315688=Farmers and consumers denounced the bakers for starving them; but what were their profits? In the Agricultural Returns for 1903 the price of a hundredweight of corn is 8s. 11d., and that of white bread\u2014a 1-lb. loaf\u2014is 11/4d.; the 3/10d. per lb. difference\u201429 per cent.\u2014has to cover the cost of grinding, general expenses of the milling and baking, the bakers\u2019 risks, which are very considerable, since, in times of crises, the baker is the poor man\u2019s banker. It can be said, then, that while the duty is incapable of affording complete protection to corn in times of abundance, it becomes a crushing burden when prices rise, and a burden that falls upon the working classes, the least able to bear it, whose diet is the least varied, and who, since they are employed in manual labour, require a diet not only adequate for supporting life but to sustain effort., 832812=See Yves Guyot, \u201cThe Sugar Question in 1901\u201d (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Sept. and Oct., 1902)., 132512=It is worth notice that the War of Secession took place during the years following the treaty, and made Edition: current; Page: [35] it difficult to obtain a supply of cotton. In 1863 the Government handed to the manufacturers a sum of \u00a340,000, to be used in assisting the unemployed cotton hands. In his evidence before the Senate\u2019s Committee of Inquiry, M. Delessalle admitted frankly that the motive used to obtain this sum was a mere pretex. \u201cM. Pouyer-Quertier, president of a society for assisting the unemployed, knows as well as I do that for want of people to assist another use has been found for a large portion of the fund.\u201d It would be interesting to know the use made with so little ceremony of funds diverted from their proper purpose. The cotton-spinners resented the treaty because it had forced them to improve their plant, and had hastened the substitution of mechanical for manual labour. Since, however, the number of factories had increased, and the horse-power of the engines employed, it is not easy to draw, with M. Pouyer-Quertier, the conclusion that the industry has been ruined. Figures disprove it:\u2014, 312401=Experience, then, justifies the conclusion that wheat duties cannot raise the price to its full extent in years of good harvest, while they raise them by more than the full amount in years of scarcity. Dealers in the protected country wait, not daring to buy; in France they are always afraid that the duties will be suspended, and so by not supplying the market they invite the high prices which lead to suspension. On May 4, 1898, the day after the suspension of the duties, Edition: current; Page: [118] there was a rush on the market; coinciding with Leiter\u2019s speculations at Chicago, this sent prices up with a bound; by May 10th the export price in New York was nearly 8s. per bushel. When the full effect of a duty of 2s. 10d. per cwt. is felt, it raises the price of a pound of bread 3/10d., 229105=I shall first examine the relative importance of different industries, to see whether Protection is an advantage to the majority. According to the 1896 census of persons employed in professions and industry in seventeen out of eighty-seven departments, more than 40 per cent. of the population is employed in industry. In order of diminishing proportion they are: The Nord, Belfort, Rh\u00f4ne, Loire, Seine, Ardennes, Vosges, Bouches du Rh\u00f4ne, Meurthe et Moselle, Seine Inf\u00e9rieure, Somme, Pas de Calais, l\u2019Oise, l\u2019Aisne, l\u2019Aube, Seine et Oise, Marne. Taking a hundred as the total of industry properly so called, the order of importance relative to the number of persons employed is as follows:\u2014, 400460=M. Victor Modeste made an investigation into the registers of public relief, and finding there the same families again and again, one generation after another, he drew the conclusion, \u201cThe poor are Edition: current; Page: [154] becoming poorer, the rich richer.\u201d The true conclusion is that people in receipt of relief, accustomed to live upon it with the minimum of effort, make no attempt on their own behalf, or on that of their descendants, to become independent. Considering themselves as annuitants, they come to think that their submission and importunity gives them a claim to permanent relief. Cheap and showy sentimentalism, as incoherent as it is inconsistent, may well be answered in the courageous words spoken by Madame Ashurst Venturi at the Neuch\u00e2tel Conference for the Abolition of Recognised Prostitution, held in 1878. She said, \u201cNo doubt the charity whose aim is to succour the unfortunate is worthy of praise, but it must be left to the weak, to those tender and pious creatures whose task is to lift up the wounded from the battlefield where the brave and strong must fight. The work of our Federation is a work not of charity, but of justice. Justice is the highest charity, for its aim is to substitute certainty for the chance operation of pity and of philanthropy. More is done for humanity by the abolition of a bad law or a vicious system than by succouring its victims, for if such help assuages individual misery it yet leaves intact, if it does not actually help to support, the state of things which has caused that misery.\u201d, 199008=I have already adduced facts which prove that the commercial treaties of 1860 had not ruined even those manufacturers who made the loudest outcry against them. Looking at our specifically foreign trade as a whole during the quinquennial period preceding and following them, we can state\u2014, 529951=According to the Annual Statement for 1904 the average annual total import of meat is\u2014, 116265=The Emperor had frequently extended the operation of the decree of 1853 suspending the sliding Edition: current; Page: [25] scale, but in 1857 he was obliged to restore the Act of 1832 in full force. The Constitution of 1852, however, gave him the power of concluding commercial treaties; and to paralyse the opposition he must make alliances abroad which should enable him to meet it with a non possumus., 253862=The cotton industry is found in three districts, Normandy, the North, and the Vosges; and the Edition: current; Page: [94] cotton spinners and weavers, especially in Normandy, have been for three-quarters of a century ardent Protectionists. 37,500 persons are employed in spinning, 122,000 in weaving. The report of the Commission on Customs for 1891 declares, \u201cThe output in cotton spinning and weaving can actually be said to balance demand. The industry is this year in a thoroughly sound condition, as is proved by extreme commercial and industrial activity, and the firmness of the market for cotton.\u201d In 1892 this prosperous industry obtained an almost prohibitive rise in duties on thread and textiles; according to the Blue Book on Direct Taxation, the number of spindles in spinning mills was some 3,799,400 in 1891; after that year there are no official statistics, but the Cotton-spinners\u2019 Union fixed the number in 1904 at 6,150,000, a 62 per cent. increase, while the increase in consumption for the same period was only 31 per cent., 758105=A further source of confusion lies in the fact that re-exports are sometimes included in exports and imports and sometimes not. For example, in 1903 \u00a3640,000 worth of indigo was included in French exports, whereas in Belgium the cotton imported for re-exportation is deducted from the imports., 720214=Up to September 1, 1903, there was a bounty on the export of sugar, and alcohol has still a bounty of 81/2d. per gallon. Other bounties were granted by Cartels, associations of producers which marshalled industry under the benevolent eye of the Government, on the military system of the \u201cflogging corporal.\u201d Raffalovich\u2019s recent work on \u201cTrusts and Cartels\u201d gives the truly wonderful results of this system. In 1891 the mine and metal Cartels agreed to give bounties on exportation in order to clear the home market, the amount of the bounty being calculated with reference to the distance of the factory from the frontier; those factories which wished to share in the benefits had to Edition: current; Page: [271] submit their books to the distributing official. In 1901 the mines of the Ruhr were over-productive; the theoretical reduction of output which was 15 per cent. in October, was carried to 20 per cent. It was found necessary to stimulate export, and the Syndicate raised the margin reserved for covering losses on export from 3 per cent. in 1900 to 6 per cent. in 1901-2. The bounty paid by the mines producing more than this specified tonnage and the indemnity allowed to those producing less was raised from 6d. to 1s. Cartels could increase home consumption by lowering prices, but that was not their aim; they reserved all their favours for the foreigner: the price of blast furnace coke was only lowered from 17s. to 15s. a ton, and that of coke from 10s. to 9s. 6d. a ton, although the sales in 1901 were 13 per cent. lower than those in 1900. The coke sold at home at 15s. was sold by the Cartel in France, Luxembourg, and Belgium at 12s. 6d., and a contract has been produced referring to a sale to a factory in Bohemia at 11s., 492173=According to the Report on Agricultural Returns the price of wheat in 1839, 1840, 1841, was more than 8s. a bushel. In 1846 the Corn Laws were repealed; in the famine year which followed wheat rose 8s. and 8s. 6d.; how high would it have risen if the Corn Laws had not been repealed? In 1848 it fell to 6s. 33/4d., in 1849 5s. 61/4d., 1850 5s. 01/4d., 1851 4s. 93/4d., 1852 5s. 1d.; rising again during the war with Russia\u2014at that time the great centre of the wheat supply\u2014only to fall immediately afterwards to 5s. 61/4d.; and except for one year, 1867, it never rose again to 8s. In 1894-5 it fell to below 3s., and since then has varied between 3s. and 4s. a bushel. The Returns give a table showing the monthly prices of home-grown and imported wheat in England, compared with the prices in France, where it pays Edition: current; Page: [183] a duty of 2s. 10d. per cwt., and Belgium, where it is admitted free., 590667=As a matter of fact the import for 1903 was \u00a31,995,000, and for 1904 \u00a32,636,000. At the time Edition: current; Page: [215] of our conversation my interlocutor could not have been acquainted with the second total, and even if he had his statement exaggerated it by more than 40 per cent. I mention this as an example of the methods employed by the leaders of the Fiscal Reform party, even to their own supporters. This gentleman had been given the figure; he repeated it in good faith without troubling to verify it., 646428=The following table gives the value of the imports, dutiable and exempt, and the proportion of duties on the former for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903:\u2014, 617840=The example of the Argentine Republic, cited by the Financial Reform Almanac, is decisive. Between 1888 and 1890 England invested a large capital in South American railway construction. For five years, between 1886 and 1890, England\u2019s exports to Argentina exceeded her imports, \u00a338,177,000 to \u00a312,628,000. Then the railways began to succeed; the balance changed: from 1891 to 1895 English exports fell to \u00a325,300,000, and imports rose to \u00a328,100,000. Between 1896 and 1901 England had only to draw in profit on the railways; exports rose to \u00a337,114,000, imports to \u00a359,000,000., 573414=What were the 4,000,000 inhabitants of Australia to receive? According to the Board of Trade, in Edition: current; Page: [206] 1904 Australia exported \u00a323,300,000 to the United Kingdom, as follow:\u2014, 834944=Recent Economic Changes, 1889,\u201d pp. 468-74., 204297=These figures for our foreign trade ought to inspire serious reflection. They remained, during the last Edition: current; Page: [72] quinquennial period, within four millions of those for 1876-1880, and exactly equal to those for 1882-1886. While foreign trade was thus stagnant, the total trade of France had increased 52 per cent. between 1861-1865 and 1876-1880. Those who upheld the Balance of Trade theory said with enthusiasm: \u201cAll the better, for imports have diminished and exports increased.\u201d But how much? Ten per cent. There is stagnation here also, for the increase in exports between 1861-1865 and 1876-1880 had been 24 per cent. I know some one will say, \u201cPrices have fallen,\u2019 and so they have, but relatively to the preceding period they had fallen in 1876-1880; and if they fell in France they also fell in England, while England remained true to Free Trade. Compare the results:\u2014, 75721=The Colbertist formula\u2014Tariffs of 1664 and 1667\u2014Colbertism and the Dutch war\u2014The Balance of Trade: hoard up treasure and ruin others\u2014The delegates of 1701\u2014All except Rouen demand freedom\u2014Melon, and the export of money abroad\u2014Orry, the Royal Treasurer, refutes the Balance of Trade theory\u2014How a country grows rich\u2014\u201cLaissez faire, laissez passer\u201d\u2014The Physiocrats\u2014Mercier la Rivi\u00e8re\u2019s question\u2014Turgot, de Vergennes, and Pitt\u2014Treaty of 1786., 290891=Lagrange, in his \u201cThe Internal Needs of France\u2014an Essay in Political Arithmetic,\u201d reduced food to butcher\u2019s meat including pork, and corn, under which he included wheat, rye, and barley. His basis was the military ration\u201428 oz. of bread and 1/2 lb. of meat. In estimating a family budget, Lagrange assumed that in a family consisting of a man, his wife, and three children under ten, the man would eat as much as the rest taken together. On the hypothesis that one-fifth of the population is under ten, he assumed that the consumption of this fifth, added to that of the women, is equivalent to that of the men; so that, while allowing for the lower consumption of the old, the consumption for the whole of France might be rated as four-fifths of that of a population of soldiers. Following his example in taking the peace ration of the soldier as the standard, I divide the population into general classes according to the Census returns of 1876-1896, so as to be able to work out the reduction involved in the lower consumption per head of children below fifteen, women from fifteen to fifty-nine inclusive, and old people above sixty; and I exaggerate the number in this class by estimating the number of children below one year of age at 20 per cent. instead of 16 per cent., 252890=Wool is the most important of the textile industries, employing more than 200,000 persons, to 150,000 employed in cotton, and 55,000 in linen; its plant can produce twice as much as is consumed in France. M. Gaston Grandgeorge estimates the output of French woollen yarn at \u00a320,000,000, and assessing woollen cloth at a price of 4s. per lb.\u2014a rather low figure\u2014values it at \u00a331,080,000 a year.1 The export for 1903 was \u00a35,920,000 worth of textiles, \u00a33,780,000 of wool combings, a net total of \u00a312,680,000; for several years the industry has been stationary, enduring rather than demanding Protection., 687229=His imitation of Colbert made List a great man in Germany: since 1879 his spirit has governed its Government and inspired its professors. Schmoller, in his inaugural address as Rector of Berlin University, took care to warn the professors that \u201cdisciples of Adam Smith were no use there: if they did not wish to resign their chairs, their science must conform to the exigencies of politics.\u201d At the Berlin International Statistical Institute, I heard Wagner, in a lecture on the incidence of Customs duties, speak of Bismarck as an infallible authority to whom every statistician must bow the knee. And what are the results of this national political economy, which is an instrumentum regni, and not a search for truth? what are the results of its axioms and the means employed to realise them?, 751648=If England had paid the same price for her imports as she did in 1903, their value was \u00a3480,000,000\u2014an increase of 11/2 per cent.; and so for exports, an increase of 2\u00b78 per cent. Then taking imports and exports together, we find the actual figures for British trade to be:\u2014, 823558=In the export of so-called vin ordinaire to England, Gironde bears the predominant share, as the figures for 1903, an average year, prove., 803236=Clause 2 of the law of January 2, 1902, establishing a general Customs tariff, runs as follows: \u201cThe surtaxes in Schedule C of this Bill apply to goods of extra-European origin imported from a European country. The surtaxes in Schedule D of this Bill apply to goods of European origin imported from a country other than that of origin.\u201d, 396636=It has been shown that in Germany out of 112,000 cases of consumption in a year 80,000 are workmen. In the north Italian provinces the peasants who cultivate the corn are too poor to buy it; they are forced to live upon maize, which engenders pellagra. Our inquiry made in 1900 proves the existence of 72,000 cases of the disease with an annual mortality of from 2,000 to 4,000. Dr. Livi\u2019s inquiry into the state of the army shows the extent to which the Italians suffer from insufficient food; the ration of the Italian army is below the French; the meat ration is 67/9 instead of 101/2 oz., and yet during their first two years of service the recruits gain in weight, and the increase both in height, weight, and girth is much greater in the case of peasants than students. The death rate rose in 1867 with the rise in the price of wheat and maize; nevertheless, although the price of corn and maize rose still further in 1880 wages rose also\u2014a hundredweight of wheat or maize cost 132 hours work instead of 183, and the death rate was lower than in 1867. And in 1881, 1884, 1885 it fell in Edition: current; Page: [152] proportion to the fall in the price of corn and maize. If a fall in the price of corn lowers the death rate, a rise in price raises it. Those who force its rise by Customs Duties are doing the work of death, but since they only murder indirectly their scruples are few in proportion to their ignorance of their victims. M. M\u00e9line said calmly, \u201cThe food of the great towns where people live crowded together and workers require to be specially well nourished often leaves much to be desired.\u201d1 Whose fault is that but the man\u2019s who taxes every pound of bread 1/2d. and every pound of meat 2d.? Surely M\u00e9line is not so stupid as not to know what he is doing., 689722=In 1894, when France raised the duty on corn to 2s. 10d., Germany lowered it to 1s. 11d. per cwt. The agrarians complained that they were being sacrificed to the manufacturers: they, the solid foundation of Europe in general and Prussia in particular. The aim of the Chancellor, Caprivi, was to open markets to German manufactures; the aim of the Emperor in introducing the 1902 tariff was to close Germany to agricultural competition. The 1902 tariff is an attempt to check the flow of the population to the industrial centres and keep it on the land., 744508=The German Government, entering in 1789 on a policy of Protection, created a hotbed of Social Democracy in the developing industrial centres. In entering in 1902 on an agrarian policy it strengthened the Socialists by providing them with new arguments; by encouraging the formation of Cartels it went a long way to justify Karl Marx\u2019s theory of the concentration of Capital. When the Prussian Government bought mines and took shares in the Potassium Salt Syndicate and the Tube Syndicate it put in practice Marx\u2019s theory of Collectivism, which it is part of its political creed to deny.
