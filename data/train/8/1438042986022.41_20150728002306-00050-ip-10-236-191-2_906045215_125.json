If You Are Cutting Up And Acting A Fool Just Like Anywhere Else You May Start To Fail. If You Go In There And Take Notes And Ask Questions Like You Should Then There Shouldn't Be A Problem. Just Stay Focus And Stay Out Of Trouble., 267092=Public Security on all campus are very responsible for their job. They patrol every time from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm. They are also very helpful when you need help. I one time lost my wallet and iPhone at Clarkson Campus. I reported my lost to the Police of school and they just took 4 hours to find out my wallet and phone. I thought they couldn't find those things for me, but they could. Incredible! Rate 5 stars for security and police at GPC., 619536=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 324005=it all comes down to the teacher. the school itself tries to make it easy for you to pass, but teachers will not pass you unless you know the curriculum. that's no problem for english 1101, but if you're taking advanced physics, look out., 393681=I would say its pretty good value. Tuition is like $400 bucks for 3 hours and up to $1700 for 15 hours. If you are trying to get a degree it isnt near the value of a larger state or private school but its great for getting certain credits., 617031=Listen i am now a 2015 Associates Degree Graduate of GPC. This school is an amazing start in your college journey; if you were like me no help from family and barely hope for the future., 558745=Free activities on campus, basically all the time. We had ice skating in September on the tennis court, with actual ice skate and then there is also Peer Up. Like who doesn't want to talk about things like that? It's necessary!, 580399=Some classes are easier than others. Some of the harder classes that I've taken were Human Anatomy & Physiology 1&2, Chemistry 1151 w/lab, Microbiology and Accounting. Other than that, the classes are fairly easy. You just have to put the time and the effort into studying. Talk to your professors if you don't understand something. They are willing to help you in any way possible. A lot of them allow you to meet with them before or after class hours.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck A plus for those who may not be ready for the $15,000+ tuition, that you would get at a 4 year. In state students save a lot. Example, a semester I was $1,117. Talk about savings!!!! Did enjoy being here At first I didn't enjoy being at GPC due to the fact I felt I should've been enrolled at a University. : P. Yet I can say looking back that it helped shape who I am today. What did I know then, I was only 18. Didn't really feel I got the college experience that I wanted. Since its a community college. Did learn a lot I learned a great deal. From experience I had some wonderful, weird yet interesting teachers. LOL!!! In college period, regardless of 2 year or 4 year, you will learn a lot. For those of you who make the best out of your college experience. It is also best that you take notes and get familar with your professors. I.e, their methods of teaching, what they tolerate and going above the call of duty. Pays off in the long run. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
