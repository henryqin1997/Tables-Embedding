    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{159257=Oklahoma opened up their Big 12 schedule on the road with Colorado. Head coach Dan Hawkins was in his 2nd year as head coach of the Buffaloes and was looking to improve on the 2\u201310 record of the last year as well as put an end to OU's five-game winning streak against CU.[74] This was Colorado's Big 12 opener as well as their homecoming. The Buffaloes had lost fourteen consecutive games to ranked opponents.[75] On September 25, 2007, the Sooners were favored to win by about 22\u00a0points. Through four games, the Sooners were the highest scoring team in the nation with 61.5\u00a0points per game and had the second-most efficient quarterback with freshman star Sam Bradford.[75], 248928=The Dr. Pepper Big 12 Championship Game was held in San Antonio, Texas at the Alamodome for the third time; it previously hosted the game in 1997 and 1999. This was Oklahoma's sixth appearance in the game, more than any other conference member. The Tigers were guaranteed a spot in the BCS National Championship Game with a win over the Sooners. The two teams had previously met in Norman, where Oklahoma defeated Missouri 41\u201331. The crew of College GameDay previewed the matchup in front of the Alamo.[147] The GameDay crew had featured the earlier Oklahoma-Missouri game as well. Even though this game was on a neutral field and Missouri had their star running back Tony Temple (who was injured for the first meeting), the #1 Tigers were 3-point underdogs to the eighth-ranked Sooners.[148], 125394=Oklahoma and Miami had only met six times, including this year's matchup.[35] Between 1985 and 1987, Oklahoma was 33\u20133 with all three losses coming to Jimmy Johnson's Miami teams.[21][36] It began in 1985 when the unranked Miami squad came to Norman to take on Barry Switzer's No. 3 ranked Oklahoma team. The Sooners lost the game 14\u201327, they lost their starting quarterback Troy Aikman to a broken leg, and Miami was propelled to the national stage.[37] The next two times the teams met, OU was ranked No. 1 and Miami #2.[35] In 1987, the two teams met in the 1988 Orange Bowl. Again, the Sooners lost. The game is said to have featured more talent than any other game in college football history. In the 1988 NFL Draft, thirteen Oklahoma players and twelve Miami players were drafted including four first rounders and four second rounders. The head coaches of both teams would both go on to coach the Dallas Cowboys and they both remain the only people to ever win a national championship in college football and the Super Bowl.[36], 275565=Statistics from: \"Oklahoma Sooners \u2013 Cumulative Season Statistics\". University of Oklahoma Department of Intercollegiate Athletics. Archived from the original on December 7, 2009. Retrieved September 22, 2007.\u00a0, 25129=The 2006 season was the last for quarterback Paul Thompson. With his departure came the race for the next quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners. The three players in contention for the coveted spot included true freshman Keith Nichol, redshirt freshman Sam Bradford and junior Joey Halzle (the only one of the three with actual game experience). They competed throughout the summer and well into fall practice. On August 21, 2007, it was announced that Bradford would start the first game of the season.[9], 78967=The 2007 Oklahoma Sooners football team consisted of 106 total players. The class breakdown of these players was 18 seniors, 26 juniors, 21 sophomores, 17 redshirt freshman, 23 true freshman and one unknown.[20] There were eight returning offensive starters and seven returning defensive starters from the 2006 team. Overall, 50 lettermen were returning from the 2006 team (25 on offense, 20 on defense and 5 on special teams).[21] The 2007 team captains were Joe Jon Finley, Allen Patrick, Lewis Baker, Marcus Walker and Jacob Gutierrez. Finley and Patrick represented the offense, Baker and Walker represented the defense and Gutierrez represented the special teams.[22], 251635=On the first play of the second quarter, Chris Brown ran into the endzone for a Sooner touchdown. Garrett Hartley punched in the extra point to make it 7\u20133, Oklahoma. Missouri then put together a 14\u00a0play drive, but failed to score a touchdown. They had the ball, first and goal, at the Oklahoma 9. Daniel chose to keep the ball and ran it up the middle for an apparent score. However, the officials ruled that when his knee touched the ground, the ball had not broken the plane of the goal line, and the ball was spotted at the 1\u00a0yard line. The Sooners' defense then kept the Tigers out of the endzone, ultimately forcing another Wolfert field goal. The score at this point was 7\u20136, Oklahoma. The Sooners got the ball but could not do anything with it, punting it away from the 50-yard line. Missouri promptly threw three incomplete passes and punted it back to Oklahoma, where it went out of bounds at the 50. Oklahoma passed its way into the redzone on this drive, and then rushed their way into the endzone, ending with a 2\u00a0yard play by Chris Brown for the score. Hartley's extra point was good, making the score 14\u20136, Oklahoma. With 3:06 left in the half, Mizzou pressed down the field, aided by a pass to Martin Rucker for 13\u00a0yards, to which an Oklahoma 15\u00a0yard facemask penalty was added. The Tigers ended up on the Oklahoma 4\u00a0yard line, where Missouri set up for the pass, spreading the Sooners' defense out. This let Chase Daniel easily jog across the goal line for a touchdown. Interestingly, the Tigers decided to go for a two-point conversion and the tie, rather than attempt the almost sure kick and trail by one at the half. The play was a double reverse; Jeremy Maclin ended up with the ball and passed it to Martin Rucker, who was wide open in the endzone. Oklahoma got the ball back with 5 seconds on the clock and took a knee, ending the first half with a score of 14\u201314.[149], 16337=Following the season, Malcolm Kelly and Curtis Lofton were drafted in the 2nd round of the 2008 NFL Draft, Reggie Smith was selected in the 3rd, and Allen Patrick was chosen in the 7th., 15320=Conference play began with an upset loss to the Colorado Buffaloes in Boulder, Colorado on September 29, and ended with a victory over the Missouri Tigers in the Big 12 Championship Game on December 1. The Sooners finished the regular season with an 11\u20132 record (6\u20132 in Big 12) while winning their fifth Big 12 title and their 41st conference title overall. They received an automatic berth to the Fiesta Bowl, where they lost to the West Virginia Mountaineers, 28\u201348., 284253=The 2008 NFL Draft was held on April 26\u201327, 2008 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The following Oklahoma players were either selected or signed as undrafted free agents following the draft., 195515=The Sooners, coming off of a bye week, took on Texas A&M led by fifth year head coach Dennis Franchione. During his tenure at Oklahoma, Bob Stoops had compiled a 7\u20131 record for games played directly after a bye week.[111] The Aggies' trips to Norman had been unkind ever since Stoops took over in 1999. Stoops' teams had combined to score 144\u00a0points in three games to Texas A&M's 40\u00a0points[112] including the 77\u20130 victory in 2003. In 2006, however, the Sooners escaped College Station with a one\u00a0point victory. In addition, Aggie running back Mike Goodson ran for a career record 127\u00a0yards against the Sooners tough run defense.[21] In CBS Sports' weekly \"Expert Picks\", all five reporters chose Oklahoma to win.[113] Two days prior to the game, Las Vegas casinos favored OU to win by 21\u00a0points., 28122=The university announced that it would appeal the Infraction Committee's finding and the vacation of the wins from the 2005 season. University president David Boren released a statement that the university \"[does] not believe that erasing the 2005 season from the record books is fair to the over 100 student-athletes and coaches who played by the rules and worked their hearts out for a successful season.\"[11] The Sooners won the appeal to get back their wins from the 2005 season., 181546=The Tigers came into the game with a Heisman-hopeful quarterback, Chase Daniel,[98] and Jeremy Maclin, the nation's leader in all-purpose yardage[99] (Maclin originally committed to Oklahoma but decommitted and went to Missouri).[100] Daniel broke Missouri's record for passing in a single season in 2006 when he threw for 3,527\u00a0yards. He was also a run threat averaging 38\u00a0yards per game on the ground.[101] However, the Tigers were without their leader rusher, Tony Temple, who was out with a sprained ankle.[95] On the Oklahoma side, Sam Bradford again came into the game as the nation's top-rated passer.[102], 214390=The Sooners travel led to Lubbock, Texas, to take on the Texas Tech Red Raiders and head coach Mike Leach for the Sooners' final road game of the regular season and Texas Tech's final game of the regular season. The Sooners led this series 11\u20133 since the first game was played in 1992.[129] In the last game between the two in 2006, the Sooners trailed 24\u201310 late in the second quarter but went on to score 24 unanswered points to win 34\u201324. Oklahoma receiver Malcolm Kelly also tied a school record with 11 receptions in that game.[21], 232689=Oklahoma began the game with the ball and capitalized quickly. On the opening kickoff, Juaquin Iglesias returned the ball 47\u00a0yards to the 50\u00a0yard line. The Sooners relied on the running game throughout the entire game. The Sooners worked their way towards the endzone with nine plays, seven rushing and two passing, to take the early lead. Oklahoma State went three-and-out on their first possession and Oklahoma began their next possession on their own 42\u00a0yard line. This time, it only took Oklahoma six plays, all rushing, to get back in the endzone. This included a 41\u00a0yard run by Allen Patrick. Oklahoma State had more success on their next possession. Beginning on their own 13\u00a0yard line, the Cowboys drove the 87\u00a0yards on 13\u00a0plays to get seven\u00a0points of their own on the board. Oklahoma answered with another touchdown on their next possession which included a 32\u00a0yard run for Patrick. The Sooner defense was tested on the next possession. Again, the Cowboys started deep in their own territory. They drove nearly 60\u00a0yards to Oklahoma's 13\u00a0yard line. On the next play, the Cowboys got the first down when Dantrell Savage ran for 12\u00a0yards before being tackled at Oklahoma's one-yard line. Oklahoma State tried three\u00a0rushing plays up the middle but were stuffed by Oklahoma's defense. On the fourth attempt, rather than kick a field goal, the Cowboy offense tried one last time to get in the endzone. Rather than run straight up the middle as they had tried the previous three times, quarterback Zac Robinson rushed to the right but was tackled by Curtis Lofton. The ball popped loose and Oklahoma's D.J. Wolfe recovered it and was tackled at the Oklahoma 13\u00a0yard line.[139] Oklahoma followed with another touchdown that saw Bradford's two longest pass of the first half \u2013 a 24-yard throw to Jermaine Gresham and another of the same distance to Iglesias. Bradford completed a two\u00a0yard touchdown pass to Joe Jon Finley, his 30th touchdown pass of the season. That pass broke the NCAA record for most touchdown passes for a freshman quarterback. The previous record was set in 1998 by Nevada's David Neill and tied in 2006 by Texas's Colt McCoy.[140] Oklahoma State managed to score a field goal in the closing seconds of the first half. Oklahoma had scored a touchdown on every possession in the first half to give them a 28\u201310 lead going into halftime.[141][142], 171203=The game against the 2007 Texas Longhorns football team marked the 102nd meeting of the AT&T Red River Rivalry, a rivalry that has been called one of the greatest in all of sports.[77] It's the current longest running rivalry for the Longhorns and the second longest for Oklahoma, behind only the Bedlam Series with Oklahoma State.[78], 14218=The 2007 Oklahoma Sooners football team represented the University of Oklahoma in the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season, the 113th season of Sooner football. The team was led by two-time Walter Camp Coach of the Year Award winner, Bob Stoops, in his ninth season as head coach. They played their homes games at Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium in Norman, Oklahoma. They were a charter member of the Big 12 Conference., 206056=On November 10, Guy Morriss brought his Baylor Bears to Norman to take on the Sooners. The Sooners had never lost to the Bears, going 16\u20130 since the first game between the two teams in 1901 (with the second game being in 1973).[121] In 2006, the Sooners held the Bears to \u221248\u00a0yards total rushing.[21][122] However, the last time the Bears were in Norman, they took the Sooners to double overtime before Oklahoma finally pulled out the win.[121] Under Bob Stoops, the Sooners had outscored the Bears 287\u201376.[121], 141638=The Sooners, again, accomplished much in this game. Through three games, Oklahoma had scored 184\u00a0points. This set a new school record, breaking the previous record of 179\u00a0points in 1986.[51] They had also won their first three games by 158\u00a0points,[54] the most since 1972 when they outscored their first three opponents by 163\u00a0points.[50] For the second time this season, and the fourth time under Stoops, the Sooners had more than 600\u00a0yards of total offense.[51] Also, for the second time this season and under Stoops, the Sooners had over 400\u00a0yards of offense in a half.[51] Bradford finished the Miami game with ten straight completions, and when combined with his eleven straight to start the game against Utah State, it made it the second longest streak in school history, behind Bradford's own streak of 22.[51] This was Stoops' 50th win at home.[51] Allen Patrick surpassed the 1,000\u00a0yard rushing mark for his career to become the 65th Sooner to do so.[55], 106620=The Sooners opened up the season at home against the North Texas Mean Green coached by Todd Dodge. Going into the game, Oklahoma was 8\u20131 in home openers under Bob Stoops. The last time Oklahoma played North Texas was in 2003, when the Sooners held the Mean Green to 154 yards of total offense in a 37\u20133 win.[21] At the time, North Texas was affiliated with the Sun Belt Conference in the NCAA Division I FBS. The Sooners were favored to win by a wide margin with most estimates between 38 and 41 points. The official attendance for the game was 84,472, the 50th consecutive sellout and the largest crowd ever to see an opener at Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium.[25], 130866=Miami was able to keep the game close in the first half, going into halftime with the Sooners up 21\u201310. In the second quarter, Miami replaced their starting quarterback Kirby Freeman with backup Kyle Wright. Wright led the Hurricanes down the field to their only touchdown of the game. Wright was later pulled and Freeman went back into the game.[43] Wright completed seven of his fourteen passes for 65 yards while Freeman completed three of his nine for seventeen yards.[44] The Sooners pulled away in the second half. The 51 points Oklahoma scored against the Hurricanes was the most they had given up since 1998.[43] Miami finished with 139 total yards, with 52 of them coming on their lone touchdown drive.[44] Oklahoma cornerback Reggie Smith was named the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Week for his performance.[42] The Sooners finished with 411 total yards with 295 yards coming through the air and 116 yards on the ground.[45] However, because of a new NCAA rule, a bad snap to the punter which resulted in a loss of 42 yards came off the rushing total.[46], 236165=Oklahoma State began the second half with the ball. The Cowboys managed to get to Oklahoma's 23\u00a0yard line but had to settle for a field goal attempt. The 40\u00a0yard attempt by Dan Bailey hit the goal post and bounced to the ground.[143] The Sooner's next possession saw Bradford make an uncharacteristic mistake. Bradford's pass was intercepted and returned 23\u00a0yards to Oklahoma's one-yard line. The defense was unable to stop this one. After being set back five\u00a0yards on a penalty, Savage rushed up the middle on the first play to get the touchdown and put the Cowboys within 11\u00a0points halfway through the third quarter. But the Oklahoma defense did not allow an Oklahoma State first down for the rest of the game. The Sooners, meanwhile, went on to score three more touchdowns on their next three possessions. The Sooners received the ball for the last time with 5:37 left on the clock but drained the clock, ending the game with a final score of 49\u201317 in favor of the Sooners.[141][142][144], 172111=This game was listed by CBS Sportsline.com as number six on the list of games to watch during the 2007\u00a0season. \"The annual Red River Shootout in Dallas will once again feature two top-ten teams with the winner being the front-runner for not only a Big 12 title but a factor in the national title picture. The game will also feature one of the best match-ups of the year with Limas Sweed and Billy Pittman of the Longhorns facing against Oklahoma\u2019s excellent secondary.\"[79] However, the matchup was hurt when both teams suffered unexpected losses the week before.[80][81] The last time both teams entered the game after a loss was 1999.[82] The morning of the Red River Rivalry, oddsmakers favored Oklahoma to win by 12\u201313\u00a0points., 66374=In the middle of the season, several more Sooners were added to various watchlists. Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Bradford was added to the watchlist for the Maxwell Award, awarded to the nation's best player. Oklahoma has had two prior winners of this prestigious award, including Tommy McDonald and Jason White.[17] Auston English was added to the watchlist for the Ted Hendricks Award, given to the nation's best defensive end.[18] The Sooners had not yet had a winner of this award in its five-year history. Punter Michael Cohen was also receiving recognition, as he was added to the watchlist for the Ray Guy Award. Again, no Sooner had ever won this award, though Jeff Ferguson was a finalist in 2001.[19], 26245=In 2006, the team and the fanbase were stunned when the returning starting quarterback, Rhett Bomar, was kicked off the team one day before the start of fall practice. Quarterback-turned-wide receiver Paul Thompson was converted back to quarterback and led the Sooners to an 11\u20133 season capturing the Big 12 Championship and competing in a BCS bowl game. However, the fallout of the Bomar scandal began to affect the team in 2007. On July 11, 2007, the NCAA announced a finding of \"failure to monitor\" the employment of student athletes and handed out penalties, most of which were extensions of punishments already set in place by the university., 176507=With the loss, Texas opened conference play 0\u20132 for the first time since 1956, when they were in the Southwest Conference and one year before Darrell Royal became head coach of the Longhorns.[83] The win kept the Sooners in position to win the South Division of the Big 12 Conference.[91], 179968=After three games away from home, the Sooners returned to Norman to take on Gary Pinkel's undefeated Missouri Tigers in front of 85,041 fans.[92] The Tigers were picked by some in the preseason to win the Big 12 North.[1][93] Coming into the game, the Sooners were 16\u20131 against Missouri since 1984[94][95] including a 26\u201310 win the past season. The crew of ESPN's College GameDay made a visit to Norman, adding to the meaning of this Homecoming bout.[96] The Tigers entered the game ranked 11 in both polls, their highest ranking since 1981.[97] The game matched the two highest ranked teams in the Big 12 at the time and was a preview of the Big 12 Championship., 23281=On July 19, a preseason poll voted on by members of the media that cover the Big 12 was released. The Sooners were chosen to finish second in the Big 12 South behind Texas. They finished nine votes behind the Longhorns but 44 points above Texas A&M, the third team.[1] This poll was released in anticipation of the Big 12 media day which began on July 23, 2007. Most publications had the Sooners ranked between five and ten in the preseason.[2][3][4][5] Phil Steele's self-titled publication, which is considered by many to be the most accurate college football preseason prediction magazine,[6] had the Sooners ranked number three in terms of how they would finish the year and how strong the team is going into the year.[7] On August 2, 2007, Coach Bob Stoops announced at a rally that the names of players would be put back on the team's jerseys. They had been removed in a re-design before the 2006 season.[8], 64899=On August 28, 2007, the Palm Beach County Sports Commission released their watch list for the Lou Groza Award, awarded to the most outstanding place kicker. On the list was Oklahoma's Garrett Hartley. Hartley was a finalist for the award in 2006 after making nineteen of twenty field goals and going 49 of 50 on extra points.[14][15] Tight end Brody Eldridge made the Mackey Award watchlist, safety Nic Harris was on the Jim Thorpe Award watchlist, and Malcolm Kelly and Allen Patrick were both on the Maxwell Award watchlist.[16], 29130=National Signing Day was on February 7, 2007, and Oklahoma was set to sign many talented high school athletes from around the country. It ended up being a smaller class than usual due to the loss of only a few seniors. In addition to the seniors leaving, running back Adrian Peterson left early for the NFL Draft and three other players were set to be on medical redshirt for the upcoming season. There was some separation in Oklahoma's recruiting ranking by the two major recruiting websites. Scout.com ranked the Oklahoma recruiting class as the 30th best in the nation, while Rivals.com ranked Oklahoma as the 14th best. In the pre-season, incoming quarterback Keith Nichol was named one of the top-10 impact freshman for 2007.[12] Below is a list of the recruits that signed their letter of intent., 153422=The Sooner offense continued to dominate their opponents. In their first three games, the Sooners averaged 61\u00a0points per game, making them the highest scoring team in the nation.[68] Against Tulsa, they managed to maintain that average after scoring 62\u00a0points. The Sooners had scored over 50\u00a0points in four games, the first time they had accomplished that since 2003, when they scored over 50\u00a0points against Fresno State, UCLA, Iowa State, and Texas.[64][69] The Sooners also ranked third nationally in total offense coming into the game, averaging 565\u00a0total yards.[70][71] Again, the Sooners remained consistent, putting up 553\u00a0yards of total offense against Tulsa.[64] However, Tulsa, ranked fourth nationally in total offense after their first two games,[71] did its damage in the air. Of Tulsa's 398\u00a0total yards, 354 were passing yards. Oklahoma also suffered its first major injury of the season. Starting defensive end John Williams tore his Achilles tendon and would be out for the rest of the season. He later applied for a medical redshirt in hopes of getting a sixth year of eligibility.[72] This was the second injury for Williams in his career at Oklahoma, the first coming when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in the first game of the 2005 season.[73], 64225=On July 13, 2007, the Charlotte Touchdown Club released their watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy. Sooner defensive back Reggie Smith was among the 50 players listed. In the previous season, Smith had 40 tackles and three interceptions as a defensive back, and was also the main return specialist for the team, returning an interception and a punt for touchdowns.[13], 149055=The Golden Hurricane came into the game following a high scoring defeat of BYU with a final score of 55\u201347. Both teams combined for over 1,000\u00a0passing yards.[62] However, Tulsa had not defeated a team from an AQ conference since they defeated Oklahoma State in 1998.[63] This was the first Friday game for Oklahoma since it last played at Tulsa in 2002.[64], 276959=As the 2007 college football season neared the end, many organizations began to announce finalists and winners of various post-season awards. Duke Robinson was named a semifinalist for the Lombardi Award, given to the nation's best lineman. He was one of 12\u00a0athletes recognized.[151] Jermaine Gresham was named one of eight semifinalists for the John Mackey Award for the best tight end.[152] Sam Bradford was named a finalist for the Manning Award, given to the nation's best quarterback.[153] Gerald McCoy was named the Big 12 Defensive Freshman of the Year. Oklahoma also had six players make the All-Conference First Team (the most of any school[154]), six players on the All-Conference Second Team and seven players on the All-Conference Honorable Mention (these selections are made by the 12 [now 10] coaches in the league):[155], 190247=Going back on the road, the Sooners traveled to Ames, Iowa to take on first year head coach Gene Chizik and his Iowa State Cyclones. Chizik previously served on the coaching staff of the Texas Longhorns, so he was familiar with Oklahoma. However, history was on Oklahoma's side. Going into the game, the Sooners were an overall 66\u20135\u20132 against the Cyclones with only two of those losses coming in Ames (1928 and 1960).[21][108], 147482=The Sooners ventured 90 miles east to Tulsa to take on the Golden Hurricane and their new coach, Todd Graham. This was the first time that the two teams came into the game undefeated since 1919 (not including season openers).[56] The Sooners last played the Conference USA-affiliated Golden Hurricane in 2005 in Norman and walked away with a 31\u201315 victory.[57][58] Oklahoma and Tulsa first played in 1914 and had played 22\u00a0times with the Sooners leading the series, 14-7-1.
