The third-place finisher in the SPARQ Rating was 6-1, 237 pound defensive end Demi Thompson out of Lake Mary",
    "textAfterTable": "Note: The 40-yard dash and 20-yard shuttle at the Nike Combine in Orlando were timed on outdoors on grass in wet and soggy conditions. The 40-yard dash was timed digitally with SPARQ Timing, except when indicated by an asterix(*), as the final 200 participants were timed by stopwatch after electronic equipment went down due to heavy rains. Not all players chose to test or could complete all four tests due to weather and some had their marks scratched in individual events. The top 10 SPARQ Ratings should be considered unofficial until all results are verified later in the week. For more information on the SPARQ Rating 2.0, checkout SPARQTraining.com!
