            "This college is great if you are interested in sororities or fraternities. My parents are still good friends with their brothers and sisters. However, look at the school before you decide to enroll so you can get the feel for it.",
            "If you like the feel, then the school has a lot of bang for it's buck, as you will learn a lot and have fun. However, if you aren't interested in school spirit, or house life, then you probably won't enjoy this school as much.",
            "There is a club for almost everything. The weather though is not very great, so if that is a big factor, visit the campus during spring to see just how gray the skies are. It is also a big school, so I would say that if you are interested in being in a sorority or fraternity that you will enjoy this school more than if you would live in a dorm. If you like school spirit though, this is a great school. You will also live in a college town, not far away from downtown Seattle, so make sure you want to live in a town where almost everyone is a student.",

There are so many things to do: clubs, recreational sports, sporting events (division 1 HUSKIES!), etc. Sign up for your A&O sessions (advising and orientation) early! The early the date, the chances of getting a better class schedule will greatly increase, especially since the freshman class size should range from 2000 to 3000., 17299=Tuition is going up this fall of 2009, and up again in 2010. Times are tight, so there's a definite sense that the increase in tuition coupled with the decrease in professors is a bit of a jip for the students., 667167=I have never felt safer anywhere. Last quarter I had classes until 9:30 at night and had to walk back to my sorority by myself and I felt very safe. There is also a night-ride you can call to drive or walk you from place to place during the night., 637573=I am a 38 year old student and do not live in the dorms. Off campus housing can be more affordable than dorms, depending on what you consider affordable and reasonable. I live in a comfortable, though not luxurious, house. I have three other housemates. We can easily bus, walk and drive to UW, the Avenue, and the grocery stores in the area. Housing moves very fast in July and August so if you found a place you like, or potential housemates, secure it as quickly as possible., 481921=There is a large greek system at UW Seattle. There are thirty three fraternities and seventeen sororities, and we have been adding chapters each year for the past few years. All freshman new members in a chapter live in starting in September when school starts and both sororities and fraternities can be, and usually are cheeper than living in a dorm and having a dining account. The greek system houses are all located across the street from campus in a four block area, and there are about two thousand people in our system which can attest to its strength and offerings., 1083231=The wide range of dorm buildings allows students to live in quite a few locations on campus. There are dorms built in 2012 and others that dated back a century. There is even a new dorm being constructed right now for move in during the second quarter of this school year. The amenities available in the assortment of living choices will satisfy all personality types. This atmosphere promotes new friendships and the potential to find lifetime relationships., 818402=The activity center will be opening for 2012-13 academic year. There are plenty of clubs to join but you are also only a bus ride away from downtown Seattle which has a great night life.}",

This school does not hand-hold you by any means. You are responsible for figuring out how to get that extra financial aid, what classes to register for, and how to manage your schedule. Granted, there are many knowledgeable outlets for help and guidance (Mary Gates Undergraduate Advising, Departmental Advisers, Husky Mentors program to name a few), but an education at this school mainly consists of",
