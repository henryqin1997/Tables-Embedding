    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck What else can i say besides LBCC will save you loads of cash. Not only cause their tuition is cheap but they have tons and tons of scholarships to offer. LBCC keeps getting better and better for me! Am enjoying being here When I was in High School I dreaded waking up in the morning I felt as if others things were more important! I was always nervous about attending college. But since i have been at LBCC It makes me look back and appreciate what i dealt with in High School. I love college and enjoy it so much at LBCC i will more then likely miss attending this school once I graduate from it or transfer to another. Am learning a lot When I enrolled to LBCC I really thought nothing of it. In my head I just thought oh look more school. But after the first year at LBCC I have learned so much and respect and thank every professor I have had and will have in the near future. Thank you LBCC for all the help you have given me!
