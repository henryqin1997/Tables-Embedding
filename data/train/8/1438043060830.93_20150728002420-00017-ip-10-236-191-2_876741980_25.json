    "textBeforeTable": "Florida State would love freshman guard Michael Snaer to come in right away and help fill the void created by Toney Douglas' departure. Florida State was one of only five schools from the six major conferences that had only one player score in double figures last season. Here's a look at the five teams, along with their top scorers and second-leading scorers. (Scoring averages are in parentheses. Players in italics have completed their eligibility.) IN NEED OF BALANCE Florida State went 25-10 and reached the NCAA tournament last season by relying heavily on ACC scoring leader Toney Douglas, the only player on his team to average in double figures. That kind of attitude should come in handy this season. Snaer arguably has the toughest assignment of any freshman in the country. \"I can't mess up,\" Snaer said. \"I had to buckle down in school and make something for myself.\" Snaer's tenacity came from a good place. As the second-oldest kid in a family with eight children, Snaer wanted to set an example for his younger siblings. \"If he'd been that into academics [to that degree], people would have called him a nerd,\" Showalter said. \"I worried about it. To some degree, his behavior was almost obsessive. But he was just very focused",
    "textAfterTable": "Minnesota was the only other tournament team that had just one player score in double figures. Iowa State, Oregon and Rutgers were the only other programs from the six major conferences to hold that distinction. Of those five schools, Florida State is the lone team that now must replace its leading scorer. Douglas has moved on to the NBA's New York Knicks. Snaer happens to play the same position. No matter how much the Seminoles try to help ease Snaer into his new surroundings, Florida State fans are going to assume he's the guy to provide much of the scoring Douglas offered last season. \"There's a lot of pressure coming in as a freshman, but I'm willing to put that on my back,\" Snaer said. \"I can deal with pressure. I've been having to deal with it for a while now.\" Snaer already has proved he doesn't back down from a challenge. He proved that much in the days leading up to the McDonald's All American Game. The one-on-one matchups between Snaer and Texas recruit Avery Bradley - the nation's No. 4 prospect - highlighted most of those practice sessions. Jerry Meyer, a national recruiting analyst for Rivals.com, said Snaer and Bradley were at a different intensity level than all the other players in those practice",
