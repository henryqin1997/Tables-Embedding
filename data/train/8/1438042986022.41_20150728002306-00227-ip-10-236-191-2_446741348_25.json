            "Compound, a molecular switch employing the compound and a method of electronic switching - Classes of molecules are disclosed which can, for example, be used in molecular switches. The classes of molecules include at least three segments\u2014an electronic donor (\u201cD\u201d), a switchable bridge (\u201cB\u201d), and an electronic acceptor (\u201cA\u201d)\u2014chemically connected and linearly arranged (e.g., D-B-A). The electronic donor can be an aromatic ring system with at least one electron donating group covalently attached; an aromatic ring system with an electron withdrawing group covalently attached is usually employed as the electronic acceptor; and the switchable bridge can be a pi system that can be switched on or off using an external electric field.",
            "METHOD OF FORMING A CROSSED WIRE MOLECULAR DEVICE INCLUDING A SELF-ASSEMBLED MOLECULAR LAYER - A method of forming a crossed wire molecule device comprising a plurality of bottom electrodes, a plurality of top electrodes crossing the bottom electrodes at a non-zero angle, and a self-assembled molecular film chemically bonded to a surface of each of the bottom electrodes is provided. The self-assembled molecular film includes one or more defect sites and a plurality of active device molecules, each of the plurality of active device molecules including a molecular switching moiety having a self-assembling connecting group at one end of the moiety and a linking group at an opposed end of the moiety. The polymeric material chemically bonds to at least some of the linking groups of the plurality of active device molecules, causing the formation of the self-assembled molecular layer covering the plurality of active device molecules and the defect site(s). A molecular switching device is also provided."

Certain of these methods involve employing a magnetic field during manufacture to induce desired orientations of precursors, subunits, and/or molecular subassemblies. The applied magnetic field steers the precursors, subunits, and/or molecular subassemblies into desirable orientations while the precursors, subunits, and/or molecular subassemblies are assembled or self-assemble into a complex, anisotropic material. One embodiment of the present invention is a class of new, complex, well-ordered, network-like materials that include a ferromagnetic-material-based framework in which organic and/or organometallic compounds are organized. The ferromagnetic-molecule-based framework provides a scaffold for assembling the stable, precisely separated layers of organic and/or organometallic compounds and maintaining the layers of organic and/or organometallic compounds in well-ordered, anisotropic arrangements. Additional embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods for manufacturing the new ferromagnetic-molecule-based, network-like materials.</td> <td>20080258103</td> <tr> </tr> <th>Published</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Patent application number</th> <tr> <tbody> <table class=\"preltab\" id=\"inv_tab_3604579\"> <h2>Sean Zhang, Sunnyvale, CA US</h2> </table> </tbody> </tr> <td>08-25-2011</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20110204507\">TWO-SHELF INTERCONNECT</a> - Consistent with the present disclosure, a",
