Laurinaitis' 18 tackles set an all time BCS bowl game record. OSU RB Chris Wells breaks free of the LSU defense on route to a 65-yard touchdown gallop and the 1st TD in the BCS National Championship game. Wells broke Archie Griffin's record for OSU rushing yards as a sophomore. Appropriately, Wells said he didn't care about that at all after the game. This was his ninth 100-year rushing game of the year. With 1,609 yards this season, Wells passed Pepe Pearson, Tim Spencer and Archie Griffin to move into fourth place among all-time single season rushers in Ohio State history.",
