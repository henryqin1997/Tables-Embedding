I suggest applying before april or as soon as it opens up to assure that you will receive ample support! Good luck!, 154568=UNL gives GREAT scholarships. This is ultimately why I chose to go to UNL for my freshman year. As an out of state student, the price UNL offered me was within $1000 of what an in state school offered me. They also don't have many hidden fees. You get unlimited meals (which are EXCELLENT! The #1 thing I miss about UNL), free internet (don't take this for granted!), along with many other free services., 258518=The campus police are very active on campus and I never felt unsafe. They are very diligent with their work and have great standards to maintaining the safety and justice of the college. My friend lost his glasses sometime in March and they are still updating him well into the summer, so they are very persistant., 596816=The food here is pretty good and is probably what you would typically expect in a dining hall. The staff is usually friendly and the dining halls themselves are really clean. The variety of food is usually not really great, and healthy options are limited. The only really disappointing part of having a meal plan is that on the weekends, you only get two meals (Brunch and Dinner) and brunch doesn't start until 10:30. Also, the variety of food on the weekends is substantially less than what is available on the weekdays., 80068=I am a past student, then I transferred to Southeast Community College, and am returning to UNL in the Fall of 2011. The University of Nebraska Lincoln has really good professors for the most part, but it's best to ask around about which professors to take. I had one that I feel like I didn't learn anything from, but the rest have been really knowledgeable and passionate about their fields which always helps retain interest and increase learning.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students If you don't know what you want to do, UNL will help you figure it out. You won't waste your time here. It's also great for English students. There are a surprising amount of Engineering scholarships available. If you like to be involved in activities (student council, sports, clubs) there are tons at UNL. Tips for prospective students Search hard for financial aid. This goes for any college. There are a lot of scholarships out there just for college freshmen, and if you don't get them now you never will. If you don't know what major you want, there's a great general studies department to help you out. You'll get your requirements out the way sooner if you stay with them until you're sure what you want to do. If you jump into a major, you might end up taking classes that will be useless to you later. Most people end up switching eventually, so you're better off with the general studies people. Look into housing off-campus. It's a good way to save money. I moved into an apartment downtown at the end of my freshman year, and it's saving me about $4,000. I ride my bike home for lunch and save tons of money that way, too. Also, bring a bike. It's cheaper than driving and MUCH cheaper than parking. UNL parking permits go into the high hundreds.",
