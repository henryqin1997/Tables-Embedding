Specifically, the Tri-Pact Speed Control provides the following motor controls based on the position of the joystick: Click Photo For Enlargement (64 Kb) Click Photo For Enlargement (144 Kb) The picture shows a dual MAG speed control implemented with 20amp automotive relays that is used to control two independent tracks. The relays are installed in sockets that come with all of the wires attached (can't beat that for $1.29) The battery is connected using the red and black wires on the bottom. The common ground (black) is connected to the normally-closed (NC) pole on each relay and to one side of each relay coil. The positive wire (red) is connected to the normally-open (NO) pole on each relay and through 4 individual switches (not shown) to the other side of the relay coil via the white wires. Finally, the yellow wires are connected to the common pole on each relay",
