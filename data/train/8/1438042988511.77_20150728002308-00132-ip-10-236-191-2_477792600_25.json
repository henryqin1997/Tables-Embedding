Stroma-free, polymerized, pyridoxylated hemoglobin was essentially prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,498,141. Ascorbic acid was added at 0.8-1.1 g/L. In batch NA803, no sodium lactate was added and pH was adjusted with HCl to 9.12-8.82. In batch NF803, the final pH (no adjustment) was 8.38 and sodium lactate was added. It is not expected that the presence of sodium lactate in batch NF803 has an effect on the results of this study., 133784=For testing at recommended storage conditions (2-8\ufffd C.), units were packed in one liter bags fabricated from the barrier film described in Example 2. Two weeks following packaging, units were doped with 0.45M ascorbic acid to the desired concentration through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter using aseptic techniques, mixed thoroughly by hand and stored at 2-8\ufffd C. Upon the addition of ascorbic acid (T=0 days) and at intervals thereafter measurements of oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin were determined using a IL 482 CO-Oximeter according to the direction of the manufacturer (Tables 8 and 9). Samples were diluted, hemolyzed and brought to constant temperature prior to measurement. In addition, at T=0 and at the various intervals described in Table 10, ascorbic acid levels were determined by HPLC using an HP1100 Chemstation (Hewlett-Packard). In these same samples, tetramer elaboration was measured as % 64 kD tetramer by HPLC (Table 11)., 23147=This application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 11/231,921, filed on Sep. 21, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,341, which is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 10/124,941, filed Apr. 18, 2002, abandoned, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/284,651, filed Apr. 18, 2001., 79005=In a preferred embodiment, the diameter of the interface port is approximately 0.210\ufffd0.05 inches below an administration side membrane with, but not limited to, a range of 0.5 to 5 degrees draft or degrees of deflection. This diameter is compatible with the standard spike ports mentioned herein. A draft above the administration side membrane facilitates the gripping of the spike. The membrane thickness is approximately 0.02 inches at the spike. This dimension allows for ease in spiking. In addition, with materials such as the Ferro RxLoy polyolefin polymer resin, the membrane is compressible which facilitates the boat ports compatibility with all standard spikes. When the bag is under pressure during administration of the product, the boat port deforms to apply pressure to the spike, which eliminates the risk of the spike being expelled under pressures as high as approximately 1000 mm of Hg. In other embodiments, less elastic materials than the Ferro resin may require this membrane to be thinner to allow for ease in spiking.}",
