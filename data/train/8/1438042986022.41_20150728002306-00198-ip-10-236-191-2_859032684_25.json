            "During the titration and long-term maintenance periods, placebo was supplied as oral capsules matching galantamine capsules in size and appearance. The study drug was administered using the same titration and maintenance regimens as was used for participants in the galantamine treatment group.",
            "During the titration period (Days 1 to 84), participants received galantamine controlled-release oral capsules 8 mg/day for the first 4 weeks, followed by 16 mg/day for the next 4 weeks, then 24 mg/day for the next 4 weeks (based on tolerability). During the long-term maintenance period (Months 4 to 24), participants received galantamine at the dosage achieved at Day 84 of the titration period and continued until the completion of the Month 24 visit. A one-time dose titration to 16 or 24 mg/day was allowed, based on the investigator\u2019s judgment and participant tolerability."
