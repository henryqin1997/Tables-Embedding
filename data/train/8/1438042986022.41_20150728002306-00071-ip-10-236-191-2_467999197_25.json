The block copolymer and tackifying resin amounts are given in Table 4 (the parts by weight of tackifying resins were added in to 100 parts by weight of block copolymer). The resulting compositions were dissolved in toluene to form 30-40 weight percent solids solutions and knife coated on PET film. The coatings were dried in an oven at 70\ufffd C. for 15 minutes and conditioned in a constant temperature (25 degrees Celsius) and humidity 20 room (50% relative humidity) for 24 hours before testing. Adhesive testing was carried out according to the test methods listed above and the results are shown in Table 5. Additionally, comparative adhesives were prepared and tested according to the same procedure. Comparative Example C1 is a 95.5/4.5 IOA/AA copolymer with inherent viscosity (measured in ethylacetate at 27\ufffd C.) of about 1.6 dl/g. Comparative Example C2 is a 90/10 IOA/AA copolymer with inherent viscosity (measured in ethylacetate at 27\ufffd C.) of about 1.85 dl/g. Comparative Example C3 was prepared by dissolving 100 parts by weight of Kraton D1107 at about 35% solids in toluene. To this solution, 100 parts by weight of Wingtack Plus are added and the mixture is allowed to agitate to form a homogenous solution for coating. The results for adhesive testing is presented in Table 5.}",
