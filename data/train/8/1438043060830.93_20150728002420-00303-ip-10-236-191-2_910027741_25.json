Tips for prospective students If you can afford it it's a great school. Bang for the buck It is worth its weight in gold. But it is way to expensive when we have a family of 7 and I have a loan of over $15k from one semester :( Did enjoy being here I loved attended La Sierra. It was so personal and helpful. Did learn a lot I learned more at this school",
