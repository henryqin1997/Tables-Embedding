SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY (A.I.R. 1985 S.C.482),\u00a0 while pointing out the distinction between the words a officiating and a temporary their lordships held in reference to the Railway Establishment Manual that officiating in the ordinary connotation is generally used when a servant having held one post permanently or substantively is appointed to a post in a higher rank,. But not permanently or substantively, while still retaining his lien on the substantive post, i.e. officiating in that post till his confirmation.\u00a0 Such officiating appointment may be made when there is a temporary vacancy in a higher post due to the death or retirement of the incumbent or otherwise.\u00a0 In contrast, the word a temporary usually denotes a person appointed in civil service for the first time and the appointment is not permanent but temporary, i.e. for the time being without no right to the post.\u00a0 The Central Administrative Tribunal in O.A.No.449 of 2000 dated 25.6.2001 in reference to another case relating to the Railways, under similar circumstances, has taken the view that the applicants who had retired before a post had been upgraded cannot be said to have held the post at the time of their superannuation.\u00a0 There should be a positive act of selection in the upgraded post.\u00a0 The Tribunal, in that case, repelled\u00a0 the argument that the appointment was a mere formality and that empanelment is sufficient.\u00a0 The said judgment squarely applied to the facts of this case, since admittedly the second respondent was not promoted to the post of ADRM., 306074=2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The question of implementation of the above instructions, especially in respect of staff associated with scrap disposal came up for review by the Ministry of Railways.\u00a0 It has been decided that in the Mechanical Department the post of Section Engineer/Sr.Section Engineer connected with disposal\u00a0 of scrap may also be treated as sensitive.\u00a0 Accordingly, in item \u201cE.
