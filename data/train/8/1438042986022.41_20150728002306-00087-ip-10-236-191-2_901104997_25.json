            "Those who are interested in nursing and criminal justice, this is DEFINITELY the school for you. They cater to those majors the most, as well as a few others. Also, if you are a quiet person who is all about the academics, this is also the perfect atmosphere for you.",
            "There are clubs available, but because this is a community college, most people who attend the school have their own lives going on. So, it's difficult getting people involved in festivities, thus, making the campus kind of boring.",
            "Make sure you pay attention to the curriculum of your major before registering to attend. Make sure RVCC caters to your particular major so that you can excel here.",
            "The classes are great, but the curriculum for my major is ridiculous and should be improved. Plus, the campus is boring. I don't think this is the college for me."
