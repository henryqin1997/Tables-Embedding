SASL bucket may not be placed on any other port beside 11211. These buckets can be reached with either a vBucket aware smart client or a binary client that has SASL support. These buckets cannot be reached with ASCII clients., 241489=Here the localhost:11210 is the host name and default memcached port for a given node and beer_sample is a named bucket for the node. If you do not specify a bucket name, the command will apply to any existing default bucket for the node., 219046=The server-side Moxi port is 11211. Pre-existing Couchbase and Memcached (non-smart) client libraries that are outside the 2nd level firewall would just need port 11211 open to work., 228347=The memcached client is configured to have just one server in its server list (localhost), so all operations are forwarded to localhost:11211 \u2014 a port serviced by the proxy. The proxy hashes the document ID to a vBucket, looks up the host server in the vBucket table, and then sends the operation to the appropriate couchbase server on port 11210., 992741=11211 \u2014 Server-side Moxi port for standard memcached client access, 246355=This updates the parameter for the named bucket, beer-sample on the given node on localhost. To change the initial time that the access scanner process runs from the default of 2:00 AM UTC:, 218129=If you are deploying Couchbase behind a secondary firewall, you should open the ports that Couchbase Server uses for communication. In particular, the following ports should be kept open: 11211, 11210, 4369, 8091, 8092 and the port range from 21100 to 21199., 588023=Be aware that if you are trying to restore data to a different cluster, that you should make sure that cluster should have the same number of vBuckets as the cluster that you backed up. If you attempt to restore data from a cluster to a cluster with a different number of vBuckets, it will fail when you use the default port of 8091. The default number of vBuckets for Couchbase 2.0 is 1024; in earlier versions of Couchbase, you may have a different number of vBuckets. If you do want to restore data to a cluster with a different number of vBuckets, you should perform this command with port 11211, which will accomodate the difference in vBuckets:, 963734=In a Couchbase Server cluster, any communication (stats or data) to a port other than 11210 will result in the request going through a Moxi process. This means that any stats request will be aggregated across the cluster (and may produce some inconsistencies or confusion when looking at stats that are not \u201caggregatable\u201d)., 992906=0 to 21199 \u2014 inclusive for dynamic cluster communication, 728086=Interval between checkpoints, 60 to 14400 (seconds). Default 1800. At this time interval, batches of data via XDCR replication will be placed in the front of the disk persistence queue. This time interval determines the volume of data that will be replicated via XDCR should replication need to restart. The greater this value, the longer amount of time transpires for XDCR queues to grow. For example, if you set this to 10 minutes and a network error occurs, when XDCR restarts replication, 10 minutes of items will have accrued for replication., 992833=11210 \u2014 native couchbase data port, 730078=Document batching size, 10 to 100000 (kB). Default 2048. In general, increasing this value by 2 or 3 times will improve XDCR transmissions rates, since larger batches of data will be sent in the same timed interval. For unidirectional replication from a source to a destination cluster, adjusting this setting by 2 or 3 times will improve overall replication performance as long as persistence to disk is fast enough on the destination cluster. Note however that this can have a negative impact on the destination cluster if you are performing bi-directional replication between two clusters and the destination already handles a significant volume of reads/writes., 725467=(Number) xdcrCheckpointInterval: Interval between checkpoints, 60 to 14400 (seconds). Default 1800., 62410=Non-SASL buckets may be placed on any available port with the exception of port 11211 if the bucket is not named \u201cdefault\u201d. Only one Non-SASL bucket may placed on any individual port. These buckets may be reached with a vBucket aware smart client, an ASCII client or a binary client that doesn\u2019t use SASL authentication, 79771=The expiration value is user-specified on a document basis at the point when the data is stored. The expiration can also be updated when the data is updated, or explicitly changed through the Couchbase protocol. The expiration time can either be specified as a relative time (for example, in 60 seconds), or absolute time (31st December 2012, 12:00pm)., 964080=In general, it is best to run all your stat commands against port 11210 which will always give you the information for the specific node that you are sending the request to. It is a best practice to then aggregate the relevant data across nodes at a higher level (in your own script or monitoring system)., 272341=To prevent auto compaction taking place when your database is in heavy use, you can configure a time during which compaction is allowed. This is expressed as the hour and minute combination between which compaction occurs. For example, you could configure compaction to take place between 01:00 and 06:00., 916276=The input includes a count for each of the error types for each month. Note that because the key output includes the year, month and date, the view also supports explicit querying while still supporting grouping and roll-up across the specified group. For example, to show information from 15th November 2010 to 30th April 2011 using the following query:, 229401=The server-side (embedded) proxy exists within Couchbase Server using port 11211. It supports the memcached protocol and allows an existing application to communicate with Couchbase Cluster without also installing another piece of proxy software. The downside to this approach is performance., 1044073=vbuckets 8, 9, 10 and 11 are active at node 192.168.1.83:12004, and vbuckets 2, 6, 14 and 15 are replicas at that same node, 109807=Mac OS X 10.7 and 10.8 (64-bit only) for Developer Only. Not supported in production. Couchbase Server on Mac OSX uses 64 vBuckets as opposed to the 1024 vBuckets used by other platforms. Due to this difference, if you need to move data between a Mac OS X cluster and a cluster hosted on another platform, please use cbbackup and cbrestore. For more information, see Backup and Restore Between Mac OS X and Other Platforms., 559704=To change the initial time that the access scanner process runs from the default of 2:00 AM UTC:, 549514=For this command, host is the IP address for your Couchbase cluster, or node in the cluster. The port will always be the standard port used for cluster-wide stats and is at 11210. You also provide the named bucket and the password for the named bucket. After this you provide command options and authentication., 776236=May be returned within the view processor as:, 212680=All nodes in the cluster should be able to communicate with each other on 11210 and 8091., 239520=The server has a process that will periodically scan every key in RAM and compile them into a log, named access.log as well as maintain a backup of this access log, named access.old. The server can use this backup file during warmup if the most recent access log has been corrupted during warmup or node failure. By default this process runs initially at 2:00 GMT and will run again in 24- hour time periods after that point. You can configure this process to run at a different initial time and at a different fixed interval., 1086853=As of 2.0 build 1667, there is a special (non-public) URI to get statistics for all the btrees of an index (design document). These statistics are developer oriented and are useful for analyzing performance and longevity issues. Example:, 61713=The default bucket is a Couchbase bucket that always resides on port 11211 and is a non-SASL authenticating bucket. When Couchbase Server is first installed this bucket is automatically set up during installation. This bucket may be removed after installation and may also be re-added later, but when re-adding a bucket named \u201cdefault\u201d, the bucket must be place on port 11211 and must be a non-SASL authenticating bucket. A bucket not named default may not reside on port 11211 if it is a non-SASL bucket. The default bucket may be reached with a vBucket aware smart client, an ASCII client or a binary client that doesn\u2019t use SASL authentication., 880113=The flexible structure and nature of the startkey and endkey values enable selection through a variety of range specifications. For example, you can obtain all of the data from the beginning of the year until the 5th March using:, 1043929=vbuckets 4, 5, 6 and 7 are active at node 192.168.1.82:12002, and vbuckets 0, 1, 9 and 13 are replicas at that same node, 245834=By default the scanner process will run once every 24 hours with a default initial start time of 2:00 AM UTC. This means after you install a new Couchbase Server 2.0 instance or restart the server, by default the scanner will run every 24- hour time period at 2:00 AM UTC by default. To change the time interval when the access scanner process runs to every 20 minutes:, 886673=If you specify a group_level of 2 then you must specify a key using at least the year and month information. For example, you can specify an explicit key, such as [2012,8] :, 89901=However, Couchbase Server also allows information to be stored in the database with an expiry value. The expiry value states when a key/value pair should be automatically deleted from the entire database, and can either be specified as a relative time (for example, in 60 seconds), or absolute time (31st December 2012, 12:00pm)., 109442=Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (64-bit). You must upgrade your Windows Server 2008 R2 installation with Service Pack 1 installed before running Couchbase Server. You can obtain Service Pack 1 from Microsoft TechNet., 1043785=vbuckets 0, 1, 2 and 3 are active at node 192.168.1.81:12000, and vbuckets 4, 5, 8 and 12 are replicas at that same node, 879793=Then precise date (and time) ranges can be selected by specifying the date and time in the generated data. For example, to get information between 1st April 2011, 00:00 and 30th September 2011, 23:59:, 219258=Nodes within the Couchbase Server cluster need all the above ports open to work: 11211, 11210, 4369, 8091, 8092, and the port range from 21100 to 21199, 828669=Converts a JavaScript Date object or a valid date string such as \u201c2012-07-30T23:58:22.193Z\u201d into an array of individual date components. For example, the previous string would be converted into a JavaScript array:, 559964=In this example we set the initial time to 11:00 PM UTC., 559149=By default the scanner process will run once every 24 hours with a default initial start time of 2:00 AM UTC. This means after you install a new Couchbase Server 2.0 instance or restart the server, by default the scanner will run every 24- hour time period at 2:00 AM GMT and then 2:00 PM GMT by default. To change the time interval when the access scanner process runs to every 20 minutes:, 218417=If you\u2019re using smart clients or client-side Moxi from outside the 2nd level firewall, also open up port 11210 (in addition to the above port 8091), so that the smart client libraries or client-side Moxi can directly connect to the data nodes., 1044220=vbuckets 12, 13, 14 and 15 are active at node 192.168.1.84:12006, and vbucket 3, 7, 11 and 10, 993086=Couchbase Server supports Red Hat (and CentOS) versions 5 starting with update 2, Ubuntu 9 and Windows Server 2008 (other versions have been shown to work but are not being specifically tested). There are both 32-bit and 64-bit versions available. Community support for Mac OS X is available. Future releases will provide support for additional platforms.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "There are two types of data bucket in Couchbase Server: 1) memcached buckets, and 2) couchbase buckets. The two different types of buckets enable you to store data in-memory only, or to store data in-memory as well as on disk for added reliability. When you set up Couchbase Server you can choose what type of bucket you need in your implementation: Couchbase Server provides data management services using buckets ; these are isolated virtual containers for data. A bucket is a logical grouping of physical resources within a cluster of Couchbase Servers. They can be used by multiple client applications across a cluster. Buckets provide a secure mechanism for organizing, managing, and analyzing data storage resources.

    "textAfterTable": "The different bucket types support different capabilities. Couchbase-type buckets provide a highly-available and dynamically reconfigurable distributed data store. Couchbase-type buckets survive node failures and allow cluster reconfiguration while continuing to service requests. Couchbase-type buckets provide the following core capabilities. Capability Description Caching Couchbase buckets operate through RAM. Data is kept in RAM and persisted down to disk. Data will be cached in RAM until the configured RAM is exhausted, when data is ejected from RAM. If requested data is not currently in the RAM cache, it will be loaded automatically from disk. Persistence Data objects can be persisted asynchronously to hard-disk resources from memory to provide protection from server restarts or minor failures. Persistence properties are set at the bucket level. Replication A configurable number of replica servers can receive copies of all data objects in the Couchbase-type bucket. If the host machine fails, a replica server can be promoted to be the host server, providing high availability cluster operations via failover. Replication is configured at the bucket level. Rebalancing Rebalancing enables load distribution across resources and dynamic addition or removal of buckets and servers in the cluster.
