These tests verify whether the voice application can service requests from a user. For example, you can use synthetic tests to verify whether phones can register with a Cisco Unified CM. You can configure these test to run periodically. Synthetic tests use synthetic phones to measure the availability of voice applications by emulating your actions. For example, a synthetic test places a call between clusters and then checks whether the call is successful. Prime Collaboration can monitor the information returned from the synthetic tests and generate events based on the results. If a synthetic test fails, Prime Collaboration generates a critical event. Such events are displayed in Event Browser. Prime Collaboration supports synthetic testing for the following applications: Cisco Unified CM and Cisco Unified CM Express Cisco TFTP Server Cisco Emergency Responder Cisco Unity, Cisco Unity Express, and Cisco Unity Connection",
