            "The vertical values in this data set have been filtered through visual inspection to find abnormally high and abnormally low values. In addition, these data have been filtered using a spatial filtering program that identifies and discards outlier elevation measurements. This program reads each elevation measurement within a file and identifies \"spatially close\" points (i.e. those neighboring points within a fixed radius of the point). The mean and standard deviation is calculated using the elevations of these points. If the elevation difference from the mean of the point under consideration is more than 2 standard deviations and greater than a defined distance the point is discarded.",
            "The xyz coordinates of this data set were transformed from ITRF_2000 to ITRF_1994 using datum transformation parameters from the National Geodetic Surveys HTDP software.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
