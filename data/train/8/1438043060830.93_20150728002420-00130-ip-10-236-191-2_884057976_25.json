            "The campus is actually very safe as no matter what time even when the school is quite as most students are in class the police on campus are always doing their patrols wheather it be on their car or on a golf cart or by foot. We have a new addition on campus now a few months ago. Having Camera now feels its even safer then it was then.",
            "All year round their always seem to have some kind of event or club outside with music. Often you can find them at the Grullo bulding across the cafeteria. You can even take a walk to the lake and watch ducks and other widlife passing by or finding their next meal. If you have sport gears you can play tennis or baseball when the place is not use or you can run up the hill and expolre the beauty of nature at the college.",

            "Proffessors there are to help you learn for those that are serious about getting their degree or be just taking the class. Each Proffessor has their own adenda and style of teaching and lecturing. Then again most of them are very laid back as most went to community college like Evergreen valley college so they are able to relate to how the students feel.",
