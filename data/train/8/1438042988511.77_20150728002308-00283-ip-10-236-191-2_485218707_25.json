    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6218=FIG. 8 is a GBS display in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The upper right area of the screen shows the account list. There are four types of accounts: Assets, Liabilities & Equity, Revenues, and Expenses. The user clicks on one of the tabs to show the accounts of the corresponding type. The student journalizes a transaction by dragging an account from the account list onto the journal entry Debits or Credits. The student then enters the dollar amounts to debit or credit each account in the entry. In the interface, as in real life, the student can have multi-legged journal entries (i.e., debiting or crediting multiple accounts). A Toolbar 1200 and the first transaction of this Task 1210 appear prominently on the display. The student can move forward and back through the stack of transactions. For each transaction, the student must identify which accounts to debit and which to credit. When the student is done, he clicks the Team button. FIG. 9 is a feedback display in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The student may attempt to outsmart the system by submitting without doing anything. The ICAT system identifies that the student has not done a substantial amount of work and returns the administrative feedback depicted in FIG. 9. The feedback points out that nothing has been done, but it also states that if the student does some work, the tutor will focus on the first few journal entries. FIG. 10 illustrates a journal entry simulation in accordance with a preferred embodiment. FIG. 11 illustrates a simulated Bell Phone Bill journal entry in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The journal entry is accomplished by debiting Utilities Expenses and Crediting Cash for $700 each. FIG. 12 illustrates a feedback display in accordance with a preferred embodiment. After attempting to journalize the first three transactions, the student submits his work and receives the feedback depicted in FIG. 12. The feedback starts by focusing the student on the area of work being evaluated. The ICAT states that it is only looking at the first three journal entries. The feedback states that the first two entries are completely wrong, but the third is close. If the student had made large mistakes on each of the first three transactions, then the ICAT may have given redirect feedback, thinking a global error occurred. The third bullet point also highlights how specific the feedback can become, identifying near misses.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{189798=These are the steps required to configure that simulation: Define a name for cell C2 in Excel. Here we have defined \u201cDistinct-Input\u201d. In the ICA, define a task that will be assigned to the simulation. Ex: a TaskID of 123 is generated by the ICA. In the ICA, define a Target for the input. Ex: a TargetID of 4001 is generated by the ICA. In the ICA, define a SourceItem for the input. Ex: a SourceItemID of 1201 is generated by the ICA. Associate the input to a path (refer to Path object discussion). Add the information in the Input table of the simulation engine database. A record in an Input table is presented below., 196107=These are the steps required to configure that section of the simulation: Define a name for cell C11 in excel. here we have defined \u201cDragdrop_Input\u201d; Let's use the same TaskID as before since Question 2 is part of the same simulation as Question 1. Ex: TaskID is 123; In the ICA, define a Target for the input. Ex: a TargetID of 4002 is generated by the ICA; In the ICA, define a SourceItem for every possible answer to the question. Ex: SourceItemIDs 1202 to 1205 are generated by the ICA; Associate the input to a path (refer to Path object discussion); and Add the information in the Input table of the simulation engine database. A record in the Input table in accordance with a preferred embodiment is presented below., 219020=All this information is stored for every output in the Output table of the simulation database (ICASim.mdb). When designers construct their simulation model, they must be aware of the fact that there is only 1 type of Outputs: the Distinct Output. A Distinct Output consists of one and only one spreadsheet cell that contains a formula or a result of calculations. The existence of Output cells is the main reason to have a simulation model. If the cell is TutorAware, the ICA will be notified of any changes to the cell when all outputs are processed otherwise the ICA will be unaware of any changes. When the ICA is notified of a change two messages are in fact sent to the ICA: An ICANotifyDestroy message with the output information i.e., SourceItemID, TargetID and null as Attribute. This message is to advise the ICA to remove this information from its memory. An ICANotifyCreate message with the output information i.e., SourceItemID, TargetID, Attribute (cell numeric value). This message is to advise the ICA to add this information to its memory. As opposed to Distinct Inputs and Drag & Drop Inputs which notify the ICA on every change, Distinct Outputs are processed in batch just before asking the ICA for feedback. To notify the ICA of the total dollar amount of the items in the list. We definitely need a Distinct Output for that. The output will contain a sum formula. Define a name for cell C24 in Excel. Here we have defined \u201cDistinct_Output\u201d. Let's use the same TaskID as before since Question 3 is part of the same simulation as Question 1 and 2. Ex: TaskID is 123. In the ICA, define a Target for the output. Ex: a TargetID of 4005 is generated by the ICA. In the ICA, define a SourceItem for the output. Ex: a SourceItemID of 1215 is generated by the ICA. Associate the output to a path (refer to Path object discussion)., 28157=This application is a 35 USC 371 National Phase Filing of International Application PCT/US99/0274 entitled: A System and Method and Article of Manufacture for a Simulation Engine with a Help Website and Processing Engine, filed on Feb. 8, 1999 which is a Continuation-in-Part of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations illustrates an ICA utility in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The ICA Utilities consist of six utilities that work with the Intelligent Coaching Agent Tool (ICAT) to incorporate business simulation with the multimedia application. FIG. 30 , each on-line question has one Target Group for ease of maintenance. Each TargetGroup must have at least one related Target (4). These are the SourceItem Target mappings that were made at the end of Step 3. Next, Rules (2) are created to fire when the SourceItem Target is mapped (a question is clicked). Coach Items (3) are associated to a rule and represent the feedback which will be shown if the rule is fired. The ICA Utilities incorporate business simulation into a multimedia application. What this means is that there is now a middle layer between the application and the ICAT. These utilities, along with the simulation engine (described later), allow the architecture to be a front end to the simulation. Now, any changes to a simulation model do not need to be incorporated into code. The ICA Utilities and simulation engine work with simulation models created in Microsoft Excel. After the model is created, the designer uses the Defined Name function in Excel to flag specific cells that are to be used by the application and the ICA Utilities in accordance with a preferred embodiment. FIG. 29 is a display of video",
