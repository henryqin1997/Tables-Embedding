Through theuse of EHR Modules, eligible professionals and eligible hospitals have the opportunity to use practice management systems or clearinghouses that provide the capability to conduct administrative transactions as components of Certified EHR Technology. In that regard, we recognize the concerns expressed by some commenters that the developers of some practice management systems may not be prepared to seek certification for these legacy systems in 2010 or 2011. We also acknowledge that the required compliance date of January 1, 2012 for ASC X12N version 5010 transactions would further complicate the certification process associated with meaningful use Stage 1. However, we believe that after the ASC X12N version 5010 transition has occurred, and we approach the October 1, 2013 compliance date for HIPAA covered entities to use ICD-10, our decision to delay the adoption of administrative transactions certification criteria will prove beneficial for the adoption of Certified EHR Technology., 15889=Effective Date: This final rule is effective August 27, 2010.

Several commenters suggested replacing the functional description of the encryption standard with a specific reference to FIPS 140-2. These commenters also noted that HHS had included such a reference in an update to its guidance specifying the technologies and methodologies that render protected health information unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable that was included in the Breach Notification for Unsecured Protected Health Information Interim Final Rule, published on August 24, 2009 (74 FR 42740), and further, requested that we make our standard consistent with this guidance.

While we appreciate the commenter's point, we believe that the proposed language is unnecessary and potentially problematic. Federal agencies are already required under the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 3701et seq.) and OMB Circular A-119 [1] to use, wherever practical, technical standards that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies to carry out policy objectives or activities, with certain exceptions. In drafting the Interim Final Rule, we briefly discussed relevant provisions of the NTTAA and OMB Circular A-119, our compliance with the statute and the Circular, and we requested comments on our approach to the selection of standards. We also explained that both the NTTAA and OMB Circular A-119 provide for certain exceptions to selecting only standards developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies, namely when doing so would be \u201cinconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical.\u201d In the Interim Final Rule, we identified those instances in which we had and had not adopted voluntary consensus standards. In the instances in which we had not adopted voluntary consensus standards, we provided two principal reasons: first, that in most cases a voluntary consensus standard that could meet the requisite technical goals was simply unavailable; and second, that to the extent a potentially equivalent voluntary consensus standard was available, the standard was too limiting and did not meet our policy goals, including allowing for greater innovation by the industry. Inthis final rule, we have adopted only voluntary consensus standards, except for two government-unique standards (CMS Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) 2009 Registry XML Specification and the Office of Management and Budget Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity), a functional standard relating to vocabularies included in RxNorm, and the specified standards to protect electronic health information. We are aware of no voluntary consensus standards that would serve as alternatives to these standards for the purposes that we have identified. We encourage the HIT Standards Committee to obtain public input, hold hearings on, and recommend to the National Coordinator standards that have been developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies., 91544=(1) LOINC version 2.3, released on February 26, 2010; and, 528089=Or share a tiny url: http://govpulse.us/e/2010-17210, 435402=Section 3004(b)(1) of the PHSA requires the Secretary to adopt an initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. On January 13, 2010, the Secretary published in the Federal Register an interim final rule to adopt the initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. This final rule has been published to amend previously adopted standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria in order to realign such standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria with final meaningful use Stage 1 objectives and measures, and to respond to public comments received. Certification criteria and associated standards and implementation specifications will be used to test and certify Complete EHRs and EHR Modules in order to make it possible for eligible professionals and eligible hospitals to adopt and implement Certified EHR Technology. The use of Certified EHR Technology is one of the requirements an eligible professional or eligible hospital needs to meet in order to qualify for an incentive payment under the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs., 491728=(2) Implementation Guide for Immunization Data Transactions using Version 2.3.1 of the Health Level Seven (HL7) Standard Protocol Implementation Guide Version 2.2, June 2006, IBR approved for \u00a7 170.205., 491609=(1) HL7 Standard Code Set CVX\u2014Vaccines Administered, July 30, 2009, IBR approved for \u00a7 170.207., 493244=(1) Annex A: Approved Security Functions for FIPS PUB 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, Draft, January 27, 2010, IBR approved for \u00a7 170.210., 469814=While Complete EHRs and EHR Module developers represent a small segment of the overall information technology industry, we believe that the entities impacted by this final rule most likely fall under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541511 \u201cCustom ComputerProgramming Services\u201d specified at 13 CFR 121.201 where the SBA publishes \u201cSmall Business Size Standards by NAICS Industry.\u201d The size standard associated with this NAICS code is set at $25 million in annual receipts [17] which \u201cindicates the maximum allowed for a concern and its affiliates to be considered small entities.\u201d, 178539=Response. Many commenters misinterpreted our intent with respect to the adoption of the PQRI 2008 Registry XML specification as the standard for electronically submitting quality reporting data to CMS. Presently, CMS requires the submission of aggregate, summary level data for the purposes of meaningful use and not data at the patient-specific level. It is our understanding that the PQRI 2008 Registry XML specification is capable of serving as the \u201cenvelope\u201d for aggregate, summary level data. Accordingly, we do not believe that, as some commenters suggested, an eligible hospital's familiarity with the PQRI program is relevant to the adoption of this standard for this specified purpose. Nor do we believe that a specific implementation of this standard is necessary for hospital settings as the standard's purpose and the type of data it will transmit to CMS will be the same\u2014aggregate, summary level data. Through recent discussions with CMS since the publication of the Interim Final Rule we have determined that the PQRI 2009 Registry XML specification, a more recent version of the standards we adopted in the Interim Final Rule is a suitable replacement for 2008 version, and accordingly, we have adopted the 2009 version in its place. We believe this revision should assuage some commenters' concerns about the obsolescence of the adopted standard and reduce concerns that a wholly different standard would be adopted in the near future. If adopting a different standard for Certified EHR Technology becomes necessary, we would do so only after engaging in subsequent rulemaking., 94670=Much like minimum code set standards, we could foresee possibly adopting a backward compatible version of a previously adopted standard and allowing entities to voluntarily use the newer version for a period of time. In such cases, much like a minimum code set standard, Complete EHR and EHR Module developers would be permitted to have their Complete EHR or EHR Module certified according to the adopted backward compatible version, and eligible professionals and eligible hospitals in possession of Certified EHR Technology would be permitted to upgrade voluntarily their Certified EHR Technology to include the adopted backwards compatible version. Given that we anticipate adopting new or modified standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria every two years in sync with the initiation of a new meaningful use stage, we believe that the Secretary's adoption of backward compatible versions of standards would generally be limited to intermediate years (i.e.,2012 and 2014). To accomplish the adoption of a backwards compatible version, we would take an approach very similar to the approach described in the final e-prescribing regulation., 79241=Comments. A number of commenters across several certification criteria requested that we clarify the meaning of \u201chuman readable format.\u201d These commenters questioned what human readable format meant when it was used in the certification criteria and offered examples of what they thought would constitute human readable format such as, style sheets and PDFs. A couple of commenters suggested that human readable format should consider patients' linguistic needs. A commenter requested we discuss the compliance requirements associated with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the relevant sections of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to ensure human readable format was meant to include an obligation to provide people with disabilities alternative formats such as large print or Braille., 483900=(e)Immunizations. Standard. HL7 Standard Code Set CVX\u2014Vaccines Administered, July 30, 2009 version (incorporated by reference in \u00a7 170.299)., 489998=(1) National Council for Prescription Drug Programs Prescriber/Pharmacist Interface SCRIPT Standard, Implementation Guide, Version 8, Release 1, October 2005, IBR approved for \u00a7 170.205., 299486=At the time we published the Interim Final Rule, we noted that NLM, according to the most recent RxNorm release, listed a number of RxNorm drug data source providers with complete data sets integrated within RxNorm. After the Interim Final Rule was published, NLM subsequently released several more RxNorm versions. NLM has also reorganized the RxNorm documentation in a way that we believe more clearly specifies the intent of our standard. Accordingly, we believe that this standard, particularly in response to public comments, can be further clarified. In addition, to permit the development or mapping and use of other vocabularies independent of NLM, we have dropped the requirement that NLM explicitly identify the acceptable data sources. Instead, the standard now permits the use of codes from any drug vocabulary successfully included in RxNorm. To provide guidance and clarification to the industry, we will recognize any source vocabulary that is identified by NLM's RxNorm Documentation as a source vocabulary included in RxNorm. We are therefore revising the standard to state: \u201cAny source vocabulary that is included in RxNorm, a standardized nomenclature for clinical drugs produced by the United States National Library of Medicine.\u201d We note that in section 3.1, of the most recent release of the \u201cRxNorm Documentation (06/07/10, Version 2010-3) [7] ,\u201d NLM has identified the following source vocabularies as being included in RxNorm., 17530=HIPAAHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 488828=(4) HL7 Version 2.5.1 Implementation Guide: Electronic Laboratory Reporting to Public Health, Release 1 (US Realm) HL7 Version 2.5.1: ORU ^ R01, HL7 Informative Document, February, 2010, IBR approved for \u00a7 170.205., 517735=3. ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/datasets/DATA2010/Focusarea27/O2701a.pdf., 433104=Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major rules with economically significant effects ($100 million or more in any one year). We have determined that this final rule is not an economically significant rule because we estimate that the costs to prepare Complete EHRs and EHR Modules to be tested and certified will be less than $100 million per year. Nevertheless, because of the public interest in this final rule, we have prepared an RIA that to the best of our ability presents the costs and benefits of the final rule., 221120=Comments. Multiple commenters stated concerns that the Federal government and state governments, as well as other public health agencies, do not have the capability to receive information electronically in a standardized format. One commenter stated that while they supported using the HL7 standards, some agencies are only able to accept public health submissions if they have an HL7-based feed. Several commenters suggested that the public health reporting requirement be delayed until a single, national standard exists. One commenter stated that requiring EHRs to \u201celectronically record, retrieve, and transmit syndrome-based public health surveillance information to public health agencies\u201d is a worthwhile future goal, but they strongly questioned the likelihood that it could be accomplished within the 2011-2012 timeframe. The commenter also noted that the certification criterion did not specify which agencies (local, state, Federal) are included, and that most of those agencies are not prepared to receive biosurveillance data electronically in the format specified. The commenter concluded that it would be difficult for any EHR to prove compliance with the certification criterion as written and recommended the following alternative: \u201cElectronically record, retrieve, and be capable of producing an electronic message containing syndrome-based public health surveillance information in accordance with one of the standards specified in \u00a7 170.205(g).\u201d, 479017=(2) Standard. ASTM E2369 Standard Specification for Continuity of Care Record and Adjunct to ASTM E2369 (incorporated by reference in \u00a7 170.299)., 488208=(1) Health Level Seven Standard Version 2.3.1 (HL7 2.3.1), An Application Protocol for Electronic Data Exchange in Healthcare Environments, April 14, 1999, IBR approved for \u00a7 170.205., 521596=14. CCHIT began testing and certifying inpatient EHRs in 2007 and we assume that all of those EHRs are included in Table 1 which is why they are not included in this discussion., 455429=The second type of cost we estimate includes the costs that we expect for CCHIT-certified ambulatory EHRs certified prior to 2008 (\u201cout-of-date CCHIT-Certified-EHRs\u201d) and never previously CCHIT-certified-EHRs to beprepared to be tested and certified as Complete EHRs rather than as EHR Modules. [14] We assume the EHR technology that falls into this category may require more extensive changes than previously CCHIT-certified-EHRs identified in Table 1. Again, we have estimated low and high preparation cost ranges. We assume that there will be very little growth in the Complete EHR market due to the market share [15] represented by the previously CCHIT-certified-EHRs included in Table 1 and the upfront costs required to bring a Complete EHR to market. As a result, we expect there to be 8 and 5 Complete EHRs (for use by eligible professionals and eligible hospitals, respectively) prepared to be tested and certified to all of the applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary. [16], 447548=As we noted in the Interim Final Rule, we analyzed previously developed CCHIT ambulatory and inpatientcertification criteria and believe that many of those criteria, but not all, require the exact same capabilities as the certification criteria adopted by the Secretary at 45 CFR 170.302, 45 CFR 170.304, and 45 CFR 170.306. Generally speaking, we believe this overlap includes most of the clinically oriented capabilities required by the certification criteria adopted by the Secretary. Accordingly, we believe that a significant number of previously CCHIT-certified-EHRs will only incur moderate costs to prepare for certification. For the purpose of estimating costs, we presume that previously CCHIT-certified-EHRs include the functionality to meet the definition of a Complete EHR. As a result, for our estimates in Table 1, we anticipate that these previously CCHIT-certified-EHRs will again be prepared for certification as Complete EHRs. We estimated in the Interim Final Rule that there were 74 CCHIT-certified-EHRs certified to its 2008 ambulatory certification criteria and 17 CCHIT-certified-EHRs certified to its 2007 or 2008 inpatient certification criteria. 11, 12, 13 Of these 74 and 17 previously CCHIT-certified-EHRs, we expect that 90% will be prepared and submitted for certification according to the certification criteria adopted by the Secretary. We do not believe that it is realistic to assume that 100% of previously CCHIT-certified-EHRs will be prepared for certification for a number of reasons. These reasons include: (1) A recognition that mergers and acquisitions within the marketplace have reduced the number of previously CCHIT-certified-EHRs; (2) that the subsequent resources needed to market and promote Certified EHR Technology may not be available at the present time; and (3) that some previously CCHIT-certified-EHRs will be tested and certified as EHR Modules rather than Complete EHRs. Given these assumptions, we have estimated the number of previously CCHIT-certified-EHRs that will be prepared to be tested and certified will be 65 and 15, ambulatory and inpatient, respectively. We also believe it is reasonable to assume that of these 65 and 15, some will require more preparation than others (i.e., we assume that some EHRs that were previously CCHIT-certified will include more capabilities than what they had when CCHIT originally tested and certified them, and they may consequently be able to more easily meet the certification criteria adopted by the Secretary). Based on this assumption, we have created low and high ranges for the costs to prepare previously CCHIT-certified ambulatory and inpatient EHRs., 482495=(2)Standard.

Many commenters stated that the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) 2008 Registry XML specifications apply only in the context of eligible professionals. Some of these commenters went on to state that hospitals are not familiar with PQRI and have been submitting quality measurement data to CMS under a separate program. A few commenters recommended that this standard requirement be removed while several others stated we should adopt both Quality Reporting Document Architecture (QRDA) and the PQRI XML Registry specification in this rulemaking and move to a single standard in the next rulemaking. Other commenters recommended that QRDA not be adopted in this rulemaking. Several commenters suggested that an implementation specification for eligible hospitals be created if we intend to continue to require that quality measure be reported in the PQRI Registry XML format. One commenter expressed a concern that if the PQRI 2008 Registry XML standard is maintained as the adopted standard that there is a danger that the certification Complete EHR and EHR Module developers obtain may become obsolete before Stage 1 has run its course. Finally, a couple of commenters suggested that ONC consider deferring the naming of a standard for submission of clinical quality measures until Stage 2 and instead only require what is necessary to support clinical quality measure submission in Stage 1., 493728=(1) HITSP Summary Documents Using HL7 Continuity of Care Document (CCD) Component, HITSP/C32, July 8, 2009, Version 2.5, IBR approved for \u00a7 170.205., 306741=Response. We agree with these commenters and have adopted the OMB race and ethnicity codes. In the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs proposed rule (75 FR 1855), CMS stated that race and ethnicity codes should follow current Federal standards. We note that the OMB race and ethnicity codes constitute a government-unique standard for the purposes of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA). We have adopted this standard because it provides an easily understood structure and format for electronically transmitting the data elements identified in the meaningful use Stage 1 objective, the standard is readily available, in general it provides the best standard to use to support our policies goals. Moreover, we are unaware of any alternative voluntary consensus standard that accomplishes the same purpose., 489537=(2) ASTM E2369-05 (Adjunct to E2369): Standard Specification Continuity of Care Record,\u2014Final Version 1.0 (V1.0), November 7, 2005, IBR approved for \u00a7 170.205., 490208=(2) SCRIPT Standard, Implementation Guide, Version 10.6, October, 2008, (Approval date for ANSI: November 12, 2008), IBR approved for \u00a7 170.205., 489127=(c) ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, PO Box C700, West Conshohocken, PA, 19428-2959 USA; Telephone (610) 832-9585 or http://www.astm.org/., 518746=7. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/2010/rxnorm_doco_full_2010-3.html., 428346=Nothing required by this interim final rule should be construed as affecting existing legal requirements under other Federal laws. While the capabilities provided by Certified EHR Technology may assist in the compliance with certain legal requirements, they do not in any way remove or alter those requirements * * *. As another example, in providing patients with access to their online health information, it is important to note that the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 still apply to entities covered by these Federal civil rights laws. Additionally, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations protect persons from unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin. Under Title VI and its implementing regulations, recipients of Federal financial assistance must take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to their programs, services, and activities by eligible limited English proficient persons., 491954=(3) HL7 2.5.1 Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging Release 1.0, May 1, 2010, IBR approved for \u00a7 170.205., 470684=Based on our analysis, we believe that there is enough data generally available to establish that between 75% and 90% of entities that are categorized under the NAICS code 541511 are under the SBA size standard, but note that the available data does not show how many of these entities will develop a Complete EHR or EHR Module. We also note that with the exception of aggregate business information available through the U.S. Census Bureau and the SBA related to NAICS code 541511, it appears that many Complete EHR and EHR Module developers are privately held or owned and do not regularly, if at all, make their specific annual receipts publicly available. As a result, it is difficult to locate empirical data related to many of the Complete EHR and EHR Module developers to correlate to the SBA size standard., 169891=Comments. Several commenters requested clarification regarding the set of variables that should be included in the demographic information for the patient lists. Some of these commenters suggested that the gender, race, ethnicity and preferred language of the patient should be included in this data set. One commenter suggested that the final rule should explicitly adopt and incorporate the recommendations of a report published by the Institute of Medicine in mid-2009 entitled, \u201cRace, Ethnicity and Language Data: Standardization for Health Care Quality Improvement.\u201d, 484090=(f)Race and Ethnicity.

Further, for the purposes of testing this alternative approach, we assumed that it would be reasonable for the employees of a Complete EHR or EHR Module developer responsible for preparing a Complete EHR or EHR Module for testing and certification to be paid equivalent to a Federal employee with a Federal Salary Classification of GS-15 Step 1 ($59.30/hr plus 21.35/hr for benefits) given the educational and professional experience we believe would be necessary to lead this type of activity. Multiplying the total hourly rate by the 2500 hours yields a total preparation cost of approximately $201,000. Thus, even if we were to assume that a high average for preparation of a Complete EHR or EHR Module would be double what the commenter stated, it would only represent close to $400,000 in preparation costs. Accordingly, we believe that our estimates are in fact comparatively high and the estimate range covers a wide range of possibilities., 492093=(4) Public Health Information Network HL7 Version 2.5 Message Structure Specification for National Condition Reporting Final Version 1.0, including Errata and Clarifications, National Notification Message Structural Specification, 8/18/2007, August 18, 2007, IBR approved for \u00a7 170.205., 91620=(2) CVX\u2014Vaccines Administered, March 17, 2010., 23936=On December 30, 2009, the Federal Register made available for public inspection, an interim final rule (the Interim Final Rule) with a request for comments, which adopted an initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria.

We also explained our approach for aligning these standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria with: the adopted standard and certification criterion related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule Accounting of Disclosures Regulation under the HITECH Act; alignment with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Regulations; the Medicare Part D Electronic Prescribing Regulations; and the HIPAA Transactions and Code Sets Standards Regulations., 22072=2.

We appreciate the constructive comments and recommendations provided by commenters. We address our adoption of the patient summary record standards in this certification criterion because we believe that it is the most applicable place to do so. Section 3004(b)(1) of the PHSA requires the Secretary to adopt an initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. Section 3004(b)(2) of the PHSA provided the Secretary with additional flexibility in considering what standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria to adopt in the initial set. Section 3004(b)(2) states that \u201c[t]he standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria adopted before the date of the enactment of this title through the process existing through the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology may be applied towards meeting the requirement of paragraph (1).\u201d Accordingly, we looked at all of the standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria recognized by the Secretary at any point in time prior to the enactment of the HITECH Act to determine whether they should be included in this initial set. Contrary to some commenters statements, the CCR patient summary record standard was in fact recognized by the Secretary in 2008 (73 FR 3976) as part of the HITSP Consumer Empowerment Interoperability Specification (HITSP V2.1 2007 IS03). We understand that in January, 2009, the Secretary recognized (74 FR 3604) an updated HITSP IS03 which removed the CCR standard. We do not believe that section 3004(b)(2) precludes the Secretary from considering all possible standards that were part of the \u201cprior process.\u201d To the contrary, we believe the HITECH Act provided the Secretary with the authority and flexibility to determine which standards would be best to include in this initial set. Accordingly, we adopted both the CCR and CCD as patient summary record standards., 489720=(d) National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, Incorporated, 9240 E.

This will provide an important opportunity to align EHR technology capabilities and standards for administrative transactions with the administrative simplification provisions that the Affordable Care Act provides for health plans and clearinghouses. Therefore, we intend to include for adoption, administrative transactions standards and certification criteria to support meaningful use Stage 2 rulemaking, and expect health care providers and Complete EHR and EHR Module developers to take this into consideration leading up to 2013., 463490=In total, if we were to distribute the costs to prepare Complete EHRs and EHR Modules between 2010 and 2012 evenly per year, we believe they would likely be in the range of $67.35 to $205.3 million or $22.45 to $68.43 million per year with an annual cost mid-point of approximately $45.44 million. However, we do not believe that the costs will be spread evenly over these three years due to market pressures and the fact that higher upfront incentive payments are available under the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. We assume this factor will motivate a greater ratio of commercial vendors and open source developers of Complete EHRs and EHR Modules to prepare such technology for testing and certification in 2010 and 2011 rather than 2012. As a result, we believe as represented in Table 4 that the costs attributable to this final rule will be distributed as follows: 45% for 2010, 40% for 2011 and 15% for 2012., 492617=(1) CMS PQRI 2009 Registry XML Specifications, IBR approved for \u00a7 170.205., 434396=Section 202 of the UMRA also requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule whose mandates require spending in any one year of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. In 2010, that threshold is approximately $135 million. This rule will not impose an unfunded mandate on States, tribal government or the private sector of more than $135 million annually., 22605=The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. 111-5), was enacted on February 17, 2009. The HITECH Act amended the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and established \u201cTitle XXX\u2014Health Information Technology and Quality\u201d to improve health care quality, safety, and efficiency through the promotion of health information technology (HIT) and the electronic exchange of health information. Section 3004(b)(1) of the PHSA requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to adopt an initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria by December 31, 2009 to enhance the interoperability, functionality, utility, and security ofhealth information technology. Section 3004(b)(1) of the PHSA also permits the Secretary to adopt the initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria on an interim, final basis., 479213=(b)Electronic prescribing.
