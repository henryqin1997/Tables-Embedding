            "Description",
            "Sky Research acquired elevation data using an ALTM 3100 airborne LiDAR system at an average altitude of 1000 meters and a laser repetition rate of 71 kHz (71,000 measurements per second). The following were the LiDAR Data Acquisition Parameters: Scan width: 317 m, Scan Overlap: 50 percent, Scan Frequency: 50 Hz, Scan Angle: plus or minus 13 degrees, Average spot spacing: 0.54 m, Vertical accuracy: 10 cm, Horizontal Accuracy: 33 cm. During the data acquisition, the sensor operator observed the real-time LiDAR swath coverage to assure full coverage for the survey area. The operator also monitored the in-flight Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) and GPS satellite coverage. If tolerance thresholds of either were exceeded, data acquisition activities were put on hold until acceptable conditions resumed. After the data acquisition flight, data from GPS base stations were checked against in-flight GPS data for concurrence. Once data quality assessments were completed, all data (image and ancillary) were transferred to a centralized location for pre-processing and quality control analysis.",
            "After acquisition, the data were processed and analyzed, and the draft data was uploaded to the RVCOG interactive mapping site (IMS). Final data delivery and reporting concluded in August 2007.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received the files in las format. The files contained lidar elevation and intensity measurements. The data were in the Lambert Conformal Conic projection and NAVD88 Geoid 03 vertical datum. CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The data were converted from Lambert Conformal Conic coordinates to geographic coordinates. 2. The data were converted from NAVD88 (orthometric) heights in feet to GRS80 (ellipsoid) heights in meters using Geoid 03. 3. The data were filtered to remove outliers. 4. The LAS data were sorted by latitude and the headers were updated.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
