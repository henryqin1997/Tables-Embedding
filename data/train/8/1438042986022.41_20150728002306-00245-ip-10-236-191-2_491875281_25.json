    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{56292=Examples of the dimer acid diglycidyl ester comprise diglycidyl esters of 3-hydroxypropylene oxide or 3-hydroxypropylene sulfide and aliphatic or cycloaliphatic acids (as those terms are defined herein) having anywhere from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms and especially from about 2 to about 10 carbon atoms such as the dimer acid diglycidyl ester Aldrich Chemicals No. 43, 030-7 (Aldrich Catalog 1998, 1999 incorporated herein by reference)., 55661=Examples of epoxy/hydroxyl compounds comprise bisphenol A or bisphenol F-epichlorohydrin reaction products which are glycidyl end-capped polymers such as the EPON\ufffd compounds from Shell Chemical Co. Polyglycidyl ethers of aliphatic polyols generally comprise polyalkylene glycol diglycidyl ethers where the alkylene group has from 2 to about 5 and especially from about 2 to about 3 carbon atoms, and anywhere from about 2 to about 1000, and especially from about 2 to about 500, and preferably from about 2 to about 10 repeating polyalkylene glycol units such as polypropylene glycol (3 moles) diglycidyl ether., 29612=The silanol content, the adsorbed water content and the surface area of the silica, also affect the cure time (S. Wolff et al., American Chemical Society, Rubber Division Meeting, Denver, Colo., May 1993; M. P. Wagner, Rubber Chemistry & Technology, 49, 703, 1976). Silica, because of its high specific component of surface energy, has a strong tendency to agglomerate and is difficult to disperse in hydrocarbon rubbers. Polyfunctional organosilanes with sulfur linkages such as TESPT improve interactions of filler (e.g., silica) with a polymer, thereby improving the physical properties of vulcanizates such as abrasion resistance and reduced tan \u03b4 at 60\ufffd C. The scorch and cure times are also affected (S. Wolff, M. J. Wang, Tyre Technology Conference, Basel 1993, and Wolff et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,229,333; Thurn et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,873,489; Wideman et al., European Patent Application No. EP 0780429A1; R. J. Pickwell, Rubber Chemistry and Technology, 56, 94, 1983; K. J. Sollmann et al., Rubber Division Meeting, American Chemical Society, Cincinnati, Ohio, Fall 1972)., 88886=In all of the cases listed in Tables 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, solution SBR is styrene butadiene rubber with 25% styrene and 55% vinyl; silica is precipitated silicon dioxide (VN3 from Degussa Corp.); carbon black is Vulcan 1380 from Cabot Corp.; 6PPD is N-1,3-dimethylbutyl-N\u2032-p-phenylenediamine; X50S is a 50% dispersion of 3,3\u2032-bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide (TESPT) in N330 carbon black; wax is microcrystalline wax; aromatic oil is Sundex 8125 from Sun Oil Co.; DPG80 is 80% diphenylguanidine dispersed on an inert carrier; CBS is N-cyclohexylbenzothiazolesulfenamide; all amounts are in parts by weight per hundred parts of rubber., 189676=In this example, the compositions and their properties are shown in Table 11 and Table 12 respectively. SS28 is the control composition. It can be seen from Table 12, that the use of poly(phenylglycidylether)-co-formaldehyde (SS31), poly(Bisphenol A-co-epichlorhydrin) glycidyl end-capped, MW=380 (SS32), poly(Bisphenol A-co-epichlorhydrin) glycidyl end-capped, MW=6100 (SS33) and polyethyleneglycol, MW=1000 (SS34) significantly reduce the cure time as well as the value of the processability index compared to the control composition. The use of 2-ethylhexylglycidylether (SS29) significantly reduces the value of the processability index compared to the control composition. It should be noted that the use of a lower molecular weight epoxy resin (SS32) provides better storage stability than a higher molecular weight epoxy resin (SS33). In addition, it is clear from Table 12, that low molecular weight epoxy compounds (SS29, SS30, SS31) are more effective than polyethyleneglycol (M. P. Wagner, Rubber Chemistry and Technology, 49, 703, 1976) (SS34) as far as slowing down the adverse rheological changes that occur during storage., 27820=The difference in the surface free energy of carbon black and silica results in significant differences in the filler-filler and filler-rubber interaction. Compared to carbon black, surface energies of silica with equivalent surface area and structure, have a low dispersive component and a high specific component (M. J. Wang & S. Wolff, Rubber Chemistry and Technology, 65, 329, 1992). The low dispersive component (related to weaker polymer-filler interaction) has been shown to produce low modulus at high strains (S. Wolff, M. J. Wang & E. H. Tan, American Chemical Society, Rubber Division Meeting, Denver, Colo., May 1993). The higher specific component of the surface free energy of silica results in strong filler-filler interaction, resulting in increased viscosity of the rubber composition, especially at low strain rates., 30716=Epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) with up to 50 mole percent epoxidation has been used alone and in combination with other diene rubbers such as natural rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, or butadiene rubber at levels higher than 30 phr (parts per one hundred parts of rubber, on a weight basis) with precipitated silica and mixture of silica with carbon black to improve wet skid resistance, but with poor tire tread abrasion and tear properties. The use of epoxidized natural rubber was accompanied by increased viscosity, retardation of cure rate and poor processability on storage (\u201cNatural Rubber Science and Technology,\u201d edited by A. D. Roberts, p.359-456, Oxford University Press, UK, 1988; S. Varughese et al., Kautschuk Gummi und Kunststoffe, 43, 871, 1990). ENR, because of the higher mole percent epoxide groups (10-50%), is reinforced by silica even in the absence of coupling systems such as TESPT or \u03b3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane. The addition of a coupling system enhances the cure rate and strength properties of silica-filled ENR (10-50 mole % epoxidation). (M. Nasir et al., European Polymer Journal, 25, 267, 1989; S. Varughese and D. K. Tripathy, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 44, 1847, 1992). Epoxidized natural rubbers with an epoxy content from 15 to 85 mole percent have been reportedly used in blends with other diene rubbers such as polyisoprene, butadiene, carboxylated nitrile at a 1-15 phr level in silica or silica/carbon black reinforced tread compositions. A synergistic effect of ENR with a carboxylated nitrile was reported to improve vulcanizate properties (Sandstrom, U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,628)., 25097=This is a division of application Ser. No. 09/571,503, filed May 15, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,482,884, which has been allowed, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09/514,461 filed Feb. 28, 2000, both of which are incorporated herein by reference., 76553=Specific abietyl amine organic compounds employed according to the invention comprise Polyrad\ufffd 0515 (Hercules, Incorporated), ethoxylated (5 moles) dehydroabietylamine with about 15% dehydroabietyl amine, Polyrad\ufffd 1110, ethoxylated (11 moles) dehydrohydroabietylamine with about 10% dehydroabietyl amine, including both primary and scondary amines, and combinations thereof., 25739=Particulate fillers such as silica, carbon black, clays, talc, calcium carbonate, silicates (Science and Technology of Rubber, edited by J. E. Mark et al., Academic Press Inc., San Diego, Calif., 1994 p 387-469) and starch (F. G. Corvasce et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,639) have been generally used as reinforcing materials for rubbers to improve their physical properties such as modulus, tensile strength, abrasion, tear properties, and dynamic properties., 90850=Processability is defined inversely as the roughness of the surface of the extrudate after an extrusion experiment. The extrudate is defined as the product of an extrusion experiment. The processability was evaluated by the measure of the peak stress during a slow start-up flow experiment performed by using a modified multi speed Mooney viscometer equipped with a grooved biconical rotor, at a rotor rotation speed of 0.1 rpm at 120\ufffd C. after a preheating period of 10 minutes (S. Schaal and A. Y. Coran, Paper No. 46, presented at a meeting of the Rubber Division, American Chemical Society, Orlando, Fla., Sep. 21-24, 1999). The higher the maximum stress, which is called Mooney peak, the poorer the processability, i.e., the greater the roughness of the extrudate after an extrusion experiment. Processability, as defined here, is measured after a storage period of 8 days at 70\ufffd C. The processability index (PI) is defined as the ratio of the height of the Mooney peak of the modified composition to the height of the Mooney peak exhibited by the control composition. The lower the value of PI, the more improvement in processability compared to the control composition. Unless specified, all the processability measurements were made on non-productive compositions, i.e., compositions that do not contain any curing ingredients (CBS, DPG80, sulfur)., 77990=Other ester hydroxyl compounds containing hydroxyl, ester and optionally ether groups that may be employed according to the invention especially comprise ester diols such as propanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-, 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylpropyl ester (Chemical Abstracts Registry No.1115-20-4), and the art known derivatives thereof as given in Chemical Abstracts and incorporated herein by reference, decanedioic acid, polymer with 2-ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol and 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylpropyl, 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylpropanoate (Chemical Abstracts Registry No. 193749-51-8), also known as Ester Diol 204-sebacic acid-trimethylolpropane copolymer having the molecular formula (C10H20O4.C10H18O4.C6H14O3)x where x equal from about 2 to about 1000 and especially from about 4 to about 750; propanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-, 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylpropyl-ester, polymer with hexahydro-1,3-isobenzofurandione and hexahydromethyl-1,3-isobenzofurandione (Chemical Abstract Registry No. 228545-55-9), also known as Ester Diol 204-hexahydrophthalic anhydride-methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride copolymer, molecular formula (C10H20O4.C9H12O3.C8H10O3)x where x equal from about 2 to about 1000, and especially from about 4 to about 750; propanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-,3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylpropyl ester, polymer with 2-ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol and hexahydromethyl-1,3-isobenzofurandione (Chemical Abstract Registry No. 173196-70-8), molecular formula (C10H20O4.C9H12O3.C6H14O3)x where x equal from about 2 to about 1000 and especially from about 4 to about 750., 32371=ENR at 5-30 phr was also reportedly used in blends with diene rubber and a coupling system (TESPT) to improve the abrasion and adhesion properties of the vulcanizate. (Segatta et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,396,940). The addition of glycols, amines or guanidines to rubber compositions containing silica has been reported to counter the retarding effect of silica on the cure rate during vulcanization. Addition of diethylene glycol or triethanolamine in silica-filled rubber reduced the Mooney viscosity and scorch time. The reduction in Mooney viscosity was storage temperature dependant and was not apparently effective at higher storage temperature (M. P. Wagner, Rubber Chemistry and Technology, 49, 703, 1976). Diene rubber compositions with excellent processability and improved dispersibility of silica have been claimed when dicyclohexylamine and diene polymers modified with \u2014COOH, epoxy, amino or hydroxyl group are used in the rubber composition (H. Takamata et al., Japanese Patent No. JP 07292159). Epoxidized soybean and linseed oils have been reported to enhance the adhesion properties of rubber compositions, containing carbon black as major filler and silica as minor filler, with steel cords. No significant effects on viscosity and processability of compositions containing epoxidized soybean and linseed oils were reported with the aforementioned filler blend (Stevens et al., DE 19700967A1, Jul. 16, 1998).}",
