Houses on Orange Street average two bedrooms with rent under $1000/month., 243057=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 228613=The campus is pretty safe. I have been there three years and have never felt unsafe. I have taken several night classes that end as late as 10:30 pm and have never felt like I was in danger. This is due to the several security guards that walk/drive around the campus constantly and will answer your call promptly if you call them. There is also security cameras installed in the buildings. Campus security will also offer to walk you to your car if you ever feel unsafe.}",
