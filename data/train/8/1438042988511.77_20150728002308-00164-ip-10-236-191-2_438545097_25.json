            "TOP AND TAIL SYSTEM FOR LEAFY VEGETABLES - A leafy vegetable having a core end and a leafy end is processed after being harvested. The harvested leafy vegetable is transported to a trim area on a conveyor. A first cutting implement located in the trim area trims a portion of the core end. A second cutting implement located in the trim area trims a portion of the leafy end. The first and second cutting implements are spaced a set distance apart, which defines an amount of the leafy vegetable remaining after the portions of the core and leafy ends are trimmed. As the portions of the core and leafy ends of the leafy vegetable are being trimmed by the first and second cutting implements, a set of one or more nozzles located in the trim area sprays a rinsing liquid on cut sites on the leafy vegetable to rinse off natural juices exuding from the cut sites.",

The present invention provides compositions comprising antibodies that bind FGFR2IIIb, wherein at least 95% of the antibodies in the composition are afucosylated. In some embodiments, methods of treating cancer comprising administering afucosylated anti-FGFR2IIIb antibodies are provided. 20150050273 Published Description Patent application number Namrata Patil, Sunnyvale, CA US 09-26-2013 OFFLOADING APPLICATION COMPONENTS TO EDGE SERVERS - An apparatus and method for off-loading application components to edge servers are provided. An application is made edge-aware by defining which components of the application may be run from an edge server, and which components cannot be run from an edge server. When a request is received that is to be processed by an application on an origin server, a determination is made as to whether the application contains edgable components. If so, an edgified version of the application is created. When a request is received that is handled by a component that may be run on the edge server, the request is handled by that component on the edge server. When a request is received that is handled by a component that is not edgable, the request is passed to a proxy agent which then provides the request to a broker agent on the origin server. 20130254258 Published Description Patent application number",
