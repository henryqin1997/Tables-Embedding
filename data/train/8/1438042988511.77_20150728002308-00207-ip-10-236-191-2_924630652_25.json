Additional elements of interest to industrial hygienists which might be present in tungsten carbide grinding operations (and elements interfering with the analysis of W and Co) were included for use in performing interelement corrections and screening. Also see Section 4.3). In the case of this analytical method, W and Co spectrally interfered slightly with one another when using the wavelengths recommended by the instrument manufacturer. In addition, Ti [present in some tungsten carbide matrices as titanium carbides ( 1.5.2.

When ingested or given intravenously to guinea pigs, the chief effects of W (insoluble) and Na 2WO 4.2H 2O (soluble) are anorexia, colic, weight loss, incoordination of movement, trembling, and dyspnea ( 5.2). 1.8.2. The toxic effects of W are greater for the more soluble forms. In terms of W content, the compounds Na 2WO 4, WO 3, and (NH 4) 6W 7O 24 were shown to have decreasing toxicity to rats in the order listed. Insoluble WC was found biologically inert, although the metal W produced toxic effects. Dust chamber exposures of animals to W, WO 2, and WC produced only minor changes ( 5.2). The major toxic component in many tungsten carbide cutting tools is often the Co that provides the tough matrix in which the relatively brittle WC is embedded (",
