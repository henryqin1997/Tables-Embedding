            "Laminate and Method for Manufacturing the Same - A laminate includes a substrate, and a surface layer laminated on the substrate with an intermediate layer sandwiched therebetween. The intermediate layer has a thickness of 8 to 40 \u03bcm. The surface layer has a thickness 0.4 to 1.5 times that of the intermediate layer. The laminate satisfies the following (A) and/or (B): (A) tan \u03b4 (loss tangent) of the intermediate layer as measured under a condition of a vibration frequency of 1 Hz at 20\u00b0 C. is 0.2 or greater; and (B) A ratio (MG/SG) of a storage modulus (MG) of the intermediate layer to a storage modulus (SG) of the surface layer as measured under a condition of a vibration frequency of 1 Hz at 20\u00b0 C. is 0.003 or greater and 0.14 or less.",
            "ARTICLE HAVING MICRO UNEVEN STRUCTURE ON SURFACE THEREOF AND VIDEO DISPLAY DEVICE HAVING THE SAME - Provided is an article having a micro uneven structure on a surface thereof, wherein the article is obtained by forming a micro uneven structure composed of a cured product of a solvent-free active energy ray curable resin composition on a substrate containing triacetylcellulose, wherein an average interval between two adjacent convex parts in the micro uneven structure is less than or equal to a visible light wavelength, and adhesion between the substrate containing triacetylcellulose and a layer composed of the cured product of the active energy ray curable resin composition is classified into any one of type 0 to 2 according to a crosscut method defined in ISO2409:1992 (JIS K 5600-5-6:1999)."
