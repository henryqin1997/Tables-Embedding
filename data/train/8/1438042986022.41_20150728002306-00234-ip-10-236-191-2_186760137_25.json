No forward references are allowed. Any valid data type can be expressed as an array in the template definition. The basic syntax is as follows: array <data-type> <name>[<dimension-size>]; <dimension-size> can either be an integer or a named reference to another template member whose value is then substituted. Arrays may be n-dimensional, where n is determined by the number of paired square brackets trailing the statement. For example: array DWORD FixedHerd[24]; array DWORD Herd[nCows]; array FLOAT Matrix4x4[4][4]; Restrictions Templates may be open, closed, or restricted. These restrictions determine which data types may appear in the immediate hierarchy of a data object defined by the template. An open template has no restrictions, a closed template rejects all data types, and a restricted template allows a named list of data types. The syntax for indicating an open template is three periods enclosed by square brackets. [ ... ] A comma-separated list of",
