            "You can only enter housing with your Ucard and it only works for your specific building, so you don't have to worry about creeps coming in. During the winter the always put salt on all the sidewalks so you won't slip and fall. You're safe here.",
            "At the beginning of each semester there is welcome week. During this week a bunch of clubs set up booths in front of the union where you can sign up for clubs and the greek life. So It really isn't hard to get involved.",
            "There are none that I really know of yet.",
            "Things can be a little on the hefty side, but you get some awesome discounts at restaurants for being a student! An extra bonus is that you get free UTA services with your Ucard- I always carry that around with me.",
            "The U always has things to do, plus it's located in Salt Lake City and there are loads of stuff you can do in SLC. There are party's every week, social games to attend, seminars, school games, dances, and more. Outside of campus you have pretty much everything else: skiing, snowboarding, paint balling, sledding, ice skating, skating, etc.",
            "Their food is good and they have multiple choices to choose from, but after awhile it's pretty much the same thing; you eventually get tired of it. It is pretty expensive and each meal plan is around 3,000 dollars a semester. It's important to remember that you are required to have a meal plan if you live in housing without a kitchen.",
            "Dorm life is pretty relaxed. There are some really cool students here at the U and if you're lucky, like I was, you'll get an awesome roommate. Be aware that there is smoking and beer even though the University of Utah is considered a dry campus, but no one ever forces it on you. You don't ever have to worry about peer pressure on that matter.",
            "The difficulty level of each class really depends on the teacher and on the class. It also depends on how willing your are to put in effort and how willing you are to attend extra help classes (TA sessions). You get what you put in so keep that in mind.",
            "My tips to incomers is be informed. Know how much tuition is going to be and know how much housing will cost per semester, remember dining is included in that bill. I also recommend looking up your classes, that way it's easier to find you classes on campus. At first it may be overwhelming, but trust me you'll get the hang of it.",
            "University of Utah is a great school! I can't imagine having attended a different university and I'm very satisfied with my choice to come here. I give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars."

Even if you have a scholarship that covers living on campus you have to cough up the money for the food plan, which is like $1500. The food is edible but some people find it to be rather questionable., 702389=Outdoor activities abound! Hiking, skiing (both water and snow), swimming, tennis, canoeing, you name it, you can do it at the U and around in the nearby mountains. Plenty of open space for almost any activity. The U has great recreational facilities. The 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Sale Lake and the facilities are still in use to the public. Lots of outdoor concerts are held all through the valley and many sporting activities, outdoor fairs and festivals are held all year long. Southern Utah is beautiful year round and great for hiking., 34028=The U may overall be a tiny bit more expensive than Utah State but not by much. I am living at home (resident) and taking public transportation so all I had to pay for this semester was tuition which was around $3,000 for 14 credit hours. This amount is easy to take care of with scholarships and Financial Aid which the U offers a lot of. Just make sure to check the deadlines! They may be earlier like in February. Those are on the web and they also have departmental scholarships if you've already decided on a major; you just have to talk to your Advisor for more info. Also, as a student I get tons of free resources such as the gym/field-house use, FREE public transportation services, and academic resources such as career services (clean up your resume) or the writing center (edit a paper). Plus on top of that the U is always giving out freebies at events and discounts to restaurants and such. As a college kid free is my favorite word and the U understand that., 206576=it is a fairly diverse college with students from all over the world. it also has a good reputation in being a research university and is in the pac12. not to forget also that it has good professors, one recent one had won the 2007 nobel prize., 392750=I didn't stay in the dorms, however, I did have friends that did. I was up at the dorms quite a bit. The dorms were built for the 2000 Olympic guests and it shows. Unlike most dorms where four people share one bathroom the dorms here are spacious and have two separate bathrooms. Because the dorms were built in 2000 they are newer and pretty clean. My friends really loved being in the dorms., 892831=Dorm life is so much fun! RHA is the on-campus resident association and they constantly have things going on, like movie nights, ice cream socials, and last year we even held our own Hunger Games! The dorms are also incredibly nice since they rebuilt everything for the Olympics in 2002., 627793=The Olympic torch is outside the stadium, where the 2002 Opening Ceremony took place., 237760=my goodness, they are always having friday night events and wednesday nights there are movies at the post theater and every friday at 12:30 the spanish department puts on a foreign language film (but they keep that on the down-low)., 126517=This year I am living off campus at home. The Olympics were here in Salt Lake back in 2002 so dormitories were built for the Olympians which are now used by students., 926448=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 296813=The dorms on the University of Utah's campus are extremely nice considering they were built to house the participants of the 2002 Olympics. There is plenty of space for both your roommate and you., 242795=There's pretty much a club for everyone. and if you can't find one, you can get six random people together and start your own! Personally, I joined the marching band because they get to perform at all the football games, including bowl games! It's amazing feeling when a huuuge crowd of people cheer as you march onto the field!, 54518=The school is generally well priced, especially for in-state tuition. Housing is a bit pricey but the buildings were all just re-done for the athletes competing in the 2002 olympics. The personal rooms are spacious and the closets are pretty big, every floor has a laundry room and some kind of hang-out or study room.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck I live in-state so I was able to get the in-state tuition rate, which is pretty good. I would say if you live in-state and decide to stay in your state, you definitely get a big bang for the buck. Am enjoying being here I enjoy being here because there is a lot to do when you get bored. It almost seems as though the outdoor activities offered are endless and there is always something to do and there is some nice sight seeing and shopping around town. Another bonus? You get to experience all four seasons to a near extreme here! Am learning a lot The first year felt like a review for me (in some of my classes). I was, however, able to take classes that fulfilled some of my general education requirements where I did learn new things. The professors were also always trying to find ways to help you get good grades (with study sessions before tests, study guides, and supplemental instruction sessions) :D Login to rate or flag the reviews Alexys from Sterling, UT 08/20/2009",
