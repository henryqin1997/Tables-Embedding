            "Bridgeport is dangerous but campus security is up on it's game. We have security buttons that work on campus and a little ways off, and when pressed security can locate you within seconds and be there within one minute. You always see them driving around and they are very friendly.",
            "Not many sororities and frats to choose from, and they are predominately African or Latino based.",
            "Like I said, over 45+ activities, and they are glad to support you if you would like to create your own club.",
            "Health, Mass Comm, Business, Chiropractor, Biology, Engineering, Computer majors.",
            "This school is so expensive. If you do well in high school they provide you with amazing scholarships, but if you slacked off a bit I would look into financial aid. At 42K a year, things begin to add up. It's worth it though, it's a private school with an amazing education and we get discounts at Subway because the CEO graduated from UB. That's just one example of what you can become with a UB education and some will-power.",
            "Whatever you want! It's located in one of the largest cities in CT. It is dangerous in Bridgeport, but as long as you have a friend or your school issued security button you should be okay. The Zoo is 10 minutes away, you could go over to neighboring town Fairfield for shopping, the Trumbull mall, the campus is located right on the ocean for summer months, and lots takes place in the center of Bridgeport as well. On campus activities are great, they have 3 sororities, 3 frats, and over 45+ activities and clubs so don't be afraid that you won't find something for you.",
            "It's cool because you can eat snacks and Starbucks-esque food at the Scribe in the library for a very good price. The Marina dining hall has different vendors, like a BBQ hut, Thai food, Italian. In marina you get your food first then pay for what you get at the checkout. The HUB is set up like a high school cafeteria but with as many options as you wish. If you eat a lot I would consider getting a meal plan (they have one for commuters too) because you have to pay BEFORE you go into the hub, and then you can get whatever you would like, similar to a buffet. It does get pricey though, with lunch ranging to about $10.75 and dinner $11.75",
            "Honestly, it's college. Harder than high school but not quite real life yet. Some assignments are challenging, some you can get done in one night. Some professors allow you time to turn them in late, some will not. Your best bet is doing them ahead of time and getting them in on the respective due date. Study hard and always check with your syllabus.",
            "Come in prepared. Register as early as possible, get your books before the first day, and do your homework/classwork. The first few weeks are low key but will seriously help.",
            "The university is warm, welcoming and dedicated to their students. Expect to receive a packed pamphlet full of activities and ways for you to get used to the campus and surrounding area. Also, the dean and professors are very active in the lives of freshman, helping them to work their full potential."

The campus is gorgeous and the friendliness and personable staff is just overwhelming and extremely encouraging! The curriculums for my double majors in Criminology and Martial Arts are interesting, informative, and very modern., 2386=Within the University of Bridgeport, the classroom ratio, students to teacher, is 17:1. The classroom has very little students in each class. For example, if you are taking an English 101 class there are about 20 english 101 classes giving during the semester so that no class is over booked. That is a benefit for each student as well as the teacher., 177548=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck this school is very expensive and except you have up to 40,000 a year i wouldn't advice you to go. get financial aid and confirmed scholarships before you go or else you might find yourself out of school with no transcript and nowhere to go. Did enjoy being here i had a great time at this school. i found a home away from home there. there is a huge variety of clubs, organizations, and extracurricular activities available to choose from. if you get out your dorm room and get involved you won't have a dull moment. they also have great parties for the party lovers. Did learn a lot The classrooms were moderately sized and the teachers care about their students. if you have any problem you could talk to your teacher and they will help you. Teachers are also very knowledgeable about whatever course they teach and they are eager to pass it on to you!
