The Commission sought further comment on meeting the future funding needs of the E-rate program in light of the goals it adopted for the program in an accompanying Report and Order. The Commission acknowledges that modernizing a program of this size and scope cannot be accomplished at once and so it will continue to seek public input and additional ideas to bring 21st Century broadband to libraries and schools throughout the country. The document was published in the Federal Register on August 19, 2014., 24826=This document corrects errors in the dates section, the supplementary information portion, and Final Rules section of a Federal Register document regarding the Commission taking major steps to modernize the E-rate program (more formally known as the schools and libraries universal service support mechanism). Building on the comments the Commission received in response to the E-rate Modernization NPRM, and the E-rate Modernization Public Notice, as well as recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the program improvements the Commission adopts as part of this document begin the process of reorienting the E-rate program to focus on high-speed broadband for our nation's schools and libraries. The document was published in the Federal Register on August 19, 2014., 19890=On July 23, 2014, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) released a document which contained information collection requirements for the schools and libraries universal service mechanism (E-rate) which required approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted approval on October 27, 2014, under emergency processing for certain of the information collection requirements contained in the Report and Order as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520)., 29868=This document corrects errors in the supplementary information portion of a Federal Register document finalizing decisions to use, on a limited scale, Connect America funding for rural broadband experiments in price cap areas that will deploy new, robust broadband to consumers. The Commission will use these rural broadband experiments to explore how to structure the Phase II competitive bidding process in price cap areas and to gather valuable information about interest in deploying next generation networks in high-cost areas. The summary was published in the Federal Register on August 6, 2014., 3833=In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) takes the next critical steps to modernize the Universal Service Fund's Schools and Libraries program, known as E-rate. Building on the E-rate Modernization Order, the Commission adopted in July, the improvements to the program that the Commission adopts in this Order seek to close the high-speed connectivity gap between rural schools and libraries and their urban and suburban counterparts, and provide sufficient and certain funding for high-speed connectivity to and within all eligible schools and libraries. The Commission takes these actions to ensure the continued success of the E-rate program as it transitions from supporting legacy services to focusing on meeting the high-speed broadband connectivity needs of schools and libraries consistent with the recently adopted program goals and long-term connectivity targets. In the Order on Reconsideration, the Commission grants in part the petitions for reconsideration of the areas designated as urban for purposes of the E-rate program. The Commission also denies petitions for reconsideration of the document retention period, the phase out of support for telephone components and other services, and funding commitments that cover multiple years. At the same time, the Commission clarifies our cost effectiveness test for individual data plans and the cost allocation rules for circuits carrying voice services., 33280=\u00a7 1302 - Advanced telecommunications incentives, 9982=In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) takes momentous strides towards fully implementing a modernized universal service regime capable of meeting consumer demands for 21st century networks.
