            "The food was very good, they have many options.",
            "Centennial (the new freshman dorm) is very pretty, but the rooms are smaller. The others may not be as ascetically pleasing,but the rooms are bigger.",
            "Make sure you research well, if you want to go to a crowded school, this school won't be for you.",
            "This is very small and comfortable school. Everyone there is absolutely amazing, which (i hope) is going to make it an easier transition. I can't wait for the fall."

I was accepted to TLU in December of 2008 and started attending August of 2008 and have been there since. Providing small classes that consist of around 20 to 25 students really does make a difference. At TLU you matter unlike other institutions where your just another kid in the class. All the teachers know your name and always are encouraging you to ask questions and very helpful when you are unsure about things. TLU offers free tutoring Sunday-Thursday for all math courses, physics, etc. They even have a writing tutor! The higher level classes have an SI which has already taken the class and offers study sessions for homeworks and upcoing tests. From a personal experience, a few classmates as well as I had trouble in our economics class which didn't not have a tutor or an SI, so the teacher himself set a once a week study session with the 4 of us! It truly made a difference! Overall TLU has taught me so much. I still have much to learn and I wouldn't choose any other insitution to be at while I progress in my learning experience!}",
