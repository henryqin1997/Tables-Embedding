Reservable queues are used for interfaces configured for features such as RSVP. Range: 0 to 1000. Default: 0., 27390=The Enhanced Codec Support for SIP Using Dynamic Payloads feature enhances codec selection and payload negotiation between originating and terminating SIP gateways., 43276=Of the four codecs listed that allow dynamic payload values to be assigned, only the payload type for the clear-channel codec can be configured using the command-line interface (CLI). The remaining G.726r16, G.726r24 and GSM-EFR codecs are selected on a per-call basis by the SIP subsystem. The dynamic payload range is assigned by the IANA, with values from 96 to 127. The SIP subsystem looks for and uses the first value in the range that is both available and not reserved for Cisco IOS applications. Once a dynamic payload value is picked for a particular payload type, it cannot be used for other payload types. Of the 32 available IANA values, those reserved for special Cisco IOS applications are listed in the table below. To configure dynamic payload values for the payload types listed in the table, use the rtp payload-type command; otherwise the default values for the payload types are used., 30199=Cisco 2600 Series, Cisco 3620, Cisco 3640, Cisco 3660, 73748=SAA probes used for CAC go out randomly on ports selected from within the top end of the audio User Datagram Protocol (UDP) defined port range (16384 to 32767). Probes use a packet size based on the codec the call will use. IP precedence can be set if desired, and a full Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP), UDP, or IP header is used just as a real voice packet would carry. The SAA Responder feature was called Response Time Reporter (RTR) in earlier releases of Cisco IOS software., 298850=codec --Codec type to test. Valid values are 711 (G.711 codec) and 729 (G.729 codec)., 62424=The table below lists the possible codec configuration that, taken together with Annex B support at the remote end, result in selecting the negotiated codec., 39295=Payload types define the content and format of Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets and the resulting stream of data generated by the RTP flow. The payload type defines the codec in use and is identified in the payload type field of the header of each RTP packet. There are two mechanisms for specifying payload type, static and dynamic., 62101=Cisco implements support for multiple G.729 codec versions by using a=fmtp and a=rtpmap attributes in the SDP body of outgoing INVITE requests. For the G.729 codec, the value of a=fmtp is 18 (the IANA assigned static value), and the annexb value is either yes or no. The default for annexb is yes., 54456=A static payload value of 4 is used for all versions of the G.723 codec., 56003=Negotiated Codec, 72890=Each probe consists of multiple packets, a configurable parameter of this feature. SAA packets emulate voice packets and receive the same priority as voice throughout the entire network. The delay, loss, and ICPIF values entered into the cache for the IP destination are averaged from all the responses. If the call uses G.729 and G.711 codecs, the probe packet sizes mimic those of a voice packet for that codec. Other codecs use G.711-like probes. In Cisco IOS software releases later than Release 12.1(3)T, other codec choices may also be supported with their own specific probes., 53236=In addition to the previously supported G.723r63 version of the G.723 codec, the feature supports the following versions:, 179546=dynamic-queues --Number of dynamic queues used for best-effort conversations (that is, a normal conversation not requiring any special network services). Valid values: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096. See tables in the fair-queue (class-default) command for the default number of dynamic queues., 30103=Codec, 81904=INVITE with Session Description Protocol (SDP) body. The PSTN Fallback feature provides support for a new attribute line, a=rtr, in the SDP message body. The rtr attribute enables support for invoking fallback services. The INVITE message with SDP body provides media connection information, including IP address and negotiated codec., 273216=timer --Multiples of the RTCP report transmission interval. Range: 2 to 1000. Default: 5., 96528=For more detailed information on the structure of TEL URL, see RFC 2806, URLs for Telephone Calls., 292046=The following sample output shows configuration for the Cisco IOS VoiceXML feature. If the SIP hold timer is enabled, which is the default setting, and the timer is set to the default value of 2880 minutes, command output does not display the timers hold 2880 command. In the following partial output, the hold timer is set to a nondefault value of 18 minutes., 51314=The following sample SIP INVITE message shows the payload value and codec selection resulting from the payload negotiation process. The media m= field includes the added payload value. The attribute a= field includes the selected codec. In this outgoing INVITE message, the first available dynamic payload value of 115 is selected by the SIP subsystem for a GSM-EFR codec., 275324=RFC 1889, RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications , recommends a minimum 5-second average reporting interval between successive RTCP reports. It also recommends that this interval be varied randomly. The randomization function is performed automatically and cannot be disabled. Therefore, the reporting interval does not remain constant throughout a given voice session, but its average is the specified reporting interval., 54554=Expanded codec support allows the originating and terminating gateways to advertise and negotiate additional codec capabilities. Cisco implements support for multiple G.723 codec versions by using a=fmtp and a=rtpmap attributes in the SDP body of outgoing INVITE requests to define the G.723 codec version. For the G.723 codec, the value of a=fmtp is 4 (the IANA assigned static value), and the annexa value is either yes or no. The default for annexa is yes., 242432=number --Time (in ms) to wait before retransmitting. Range: 100 to 1000. Default: 500., 80278=Supports calls of any codec. Only G.729 and G.711 have accurately simulated probes. Calls of all other codecs are emulated by a G.711 probe., 55039=The table below lists the possible codec configurations, that, taken together with Annex A support at the remote end, result in selecting the negotiated codec., 280036=13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 test call fallback probe ip-address codec, 29302=Support for codecs varies on different platforms. See the table below for a listing of SIP codec support by platform. Use the codec ? command to determine the codecs available on a specific platform., 265043=time --Time, in minutes, before the gateway disconnects held calls. Range: 15 to 2880. Default: 2880., 98682=The SIP: Hold Timer Support feature provides a new configurable hold timer that allows you to specify a maximum hold time of up to 2880 minutes. Prior to this feature, there was no mechanism to automatically disconnect a call that had been on hold for a set period of time. When the SIP call hold process occurs in response to ISDN Suspend and Resume messages, a media inactivity timer allows a gateway to monitor and disconnect a VoIP call if no Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP) packets are received within a configurable time period. This timer is deactivated when a call is placed on hold and no media packets are sent. As a result, a call is potentially allowed to stay on hold indefinitely., 49749=The dynamic payload value selected by the SIP subsystem is advertised in the outgoing SIP INVITE request. The Enhanced Codec Support for SIP Using Dynamic Payloads feature supports dynamic payloads by expanding the SIP subsystem ability to advertise and negotiate available codecs. SIP uses the connection, media, and attribute fields of the SDP message during connection negotiation., 62002=A static payload value of 18 is used for all versions of the G.729 codec., 136446=Assigns a priority queue for jitter-probe transmissions. You must set IP priority queueing for UDP voice ports 16384 to 32767., 39663=Static payload types are assigned to specific RTP formats by RFC 1890 and these mappings are registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Although not required, static payload types can also be mapped to RTP encodings using the rtpmap attribute. The following SIP-supported codecs have static payload values defined by the IANA:}",
