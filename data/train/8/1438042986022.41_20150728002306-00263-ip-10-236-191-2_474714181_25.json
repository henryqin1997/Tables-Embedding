    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70719=The HPLC system used to monitor the USP aqueous medium can be the same reverse phase system for both cetirizine and pseudoephedrine. The column is typically a C-18 CN column, of the type available under the registered trademark ZORBAX from Mac-Mod. The mobile phase is maintained at 30\ufffd C. and can be an isocratic combination of 1:1 (v/v) water/methanol with the pH adjusted to 6.5 by adding sodium dihydrogen phosphate and sodium hydroxide, as appropriate, and made 5 mM in 1-octanesulfonic acid sodium salt. Detection can be effected for both cetirizine and pseudoephedrine with a UV detector at 214 nm. Typical retention times are 3-4 minutes for pseudoephedrine and 8-9 minutes for cetirizine, thus assuring reasonably good separation., 137018=The membrane coating described in the table below was applied to the tablet cores in a perforated tablet coating pan (Hi-Coater, HCT-30, Vector Corp.). A tablet core batch of about 1200 grams was coated by spraying the membrane solution at about 30 g/min while maintaining an outlet temperature of about 24\ufffd C. After a 20% by weight membrane was applied, the tablets were dried for approximately 16-24 hours at 50\ufffd C. on trays in a forced air oven., 143533=The dried tablets were then subsequently coated with the cetirizine HCl-containing coating shown in the following table. The drug layer was overcoated onto about 1100 grams of membrane coated tablets in a perforated tablet coating pan (Hi-Coater, HCT-30, Vector Corp.). The drug solution was sprayed at about 5 g/min while maintaining an outlet temperature of about 40\ufffd C. Enough drug layer was applied such that the tablet cores were overcoated with about 10 mg of cetirizine hydrochloride., 21657=This is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/864,490, filed May 28, 1997, now U.S. Pat.

These compounds are useful as antiallergens, spasmolytics, and antihistamines which are generally non-sedating. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,525,358 and The Merck Index, Eleventh Edition, 1989, page 310, entry 2013., 25975=In a preferred embodiment, the dosage form is substantially free of alcohols having a molecular weight less than 250, and reactive derivatives thereof. In a more preferred embodiment, the dosage form is substantially free of alcohols having a molecular weight less than 500 and reactive derivatives thereof. In a still more preferred embodiment, the dosage form is substantially free of alcohols having a molecular weight less than 1000 and reactive derivatives thereof.}",
