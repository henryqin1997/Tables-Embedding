BIS submitted a foreign policy report to the Congress indicating the imposition of new foreign policy controls on July 28, 2004., 158186=Note to paragraph (b)(1): The items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) are not controlled under EAA section 6(j) to military, police, intelligence and other sensitive end-users in Iraq. The 30-day prior Congressional notification requirement also does not apply for the issuance of licenses for such transactions involving Iraq, consistent with Presidential Determination 2003-23, in which the President exercised his authority under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003, to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq provisions of law that apply to countries that have supported terrorism. As described in \u00a7 746.3(a)(3), items to all end-users in Iraq classified under ECCNs 0B999, 0D999, 1B999, 1C992, 1C995, 1C997, 1C999 and 6A992 continue to be controlled under EAA section 6(a). Other licensing requirements continue to apply., 109102=The rule removes Iraq from Country Group E:1, found in Supplement 1 to part 740. Iraq has been added to Country Group D:1 and remains in Country Groups D:2, D:3 and D:4. Although Iraq currently remains on the list of designated terrorist-supporting countries, the anti-terrorism (AT) controls that apply to such countries under section 6(j) of the EAA will not apply to Iraq pursuant to Presidential Determination 2003-23. Countries in Country Group D:1 are of concern for national security reasons. Countries in Country Groups D:2, D:3 and D:4 are of concern for weapons proliferation reasons. As a result of Iraq's inclusion in Country Groups D:1 to D:4, the following License Exceptions may be available: CIV, CTP, TMP, RPL, GOV, GFT, TSU, BAG, AVS, ENC and KMI. A specific transaction is eligible for a License Exception only if it satisfies all of the terms and conditions of the relevant License Exception and is not excluded by any of the restrictions that apply to all License Exceptions, as set forth in the EAR (including, specifically, section 740.2)., 157650=(1) On December 28, 1993, the Secretary of State determined that the export to Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria of items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this Supplement, if destined to military, police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users, are controlled under EAA section 6(j). Therefore, the 30-day advance Congressional notification requirement applies to the export or reexport of these items to sensitive end-users in any of these countries., 142873=(d) Computer Tier 3\u2014(1) Eligible countries. The countries that are eligible to receive exports and reexports under this License Exception are Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bosnia Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cambodia, China (People's Republic of), Comoros, Croatia, Djibouti, Egypt, Georgia, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Latvia, Lebanon, Macau, Macedonia (The Former Yugoslav Republic of ), Mauritania, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Vietnam, and Yemen. As of May 2, 2002, Latvia is moved to Computer Tier 1., 118369=1. This interim rule has been determined to be significant for purposes of E.O. 12866., 199787=(i) Designated countries. The following countries have been designated by the Secretary of State as terrorist-supporting countries: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. However, the congressional notification requirement does not apply to Iraq in view of Presidential Determination 2003-23, in which the President exercised his authority under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003, to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act and any other provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism., 94866=Finally, on June 8, 2004, the UNSC adopted Resolution 1546. In this resolution, the UNSC decided that prohibitions related to the sale or supply to Iraq of arms and related materiel under previous resolutions shall not apply to such items required by the Interim Government of Iraq or the Multinational Force in Iraq to serve the purposes of the resolution. Provisions in UNSC Resolutions 687 and 707 noted above are not affected by UNSC Resolution 1546., 178877=(e) Transition for licenses issued by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Prior to July 30, 2004, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) exercised primary licensing jurisdiction for transactions with Iraq, as provided in 31 CFR part 575. This section establishes a validity period for licenses issued by OFAC for exports or reexports to Iraq., 185279=50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; Sec. 1503, Pub.L. 108-11,117 Stat. 559; E.O. 12918, 59 FR 28205, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 899; E.O. 13222, 3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 783; Presidential Determination 2003-23 of May 7, 2003, 68 FR 26459, May 16, 2003; Notice of August 7, 2003, 68 FR 47833, 3 CFR, 2003 Comp., p. 328., 103607=Such review will be conducted consistent with UNSC Resolutions 1483 and 1546, and relevant resolutions, including UNSC Resolutions 687 and 707. UNSC Resolution 1483 reaffirms Iraq's disarmament obligations contained in prior UNSC resolutions relating to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as ballistic missiles (defined for Iraq as those capable of a range greater than 150 kilometers). UNSC Resolutions 1483 and 1546 also retain restrictions on the sale or supply to Iraq of arms and related materiel and their means of production, and limit Iraq's civil or military nuclear activity, except for use of isotopes for medical, industrial or agricultural purposes. UNSC Resolution 1546 affirms these restrictions, while permitting exports, reexports, and transfers to the Interim Government of Iraq or the Multinational Force in Iraq., 159755=50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; 22 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. 2139a; Sec. 901-911, Pub.

Items subject to a license requirement under the EAR for export or reexport to Iraq as of July 30, 2004, that were previously exported or reexported to Iraq under a specific license granted by OFAC:, 292284=[FR Doc. 04-17532 Filed 7-29-04; 2:13 pm], 122830=The period for submission of comments will close August 30, 2004. The Department will consider all comments received before the close of the comment period in developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but their consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not accept public comments accompanied by a request that a part or all of the material be treated confidentially because of its business proprietary nature or for any other reason. The Department will return such comments and materials to the persons submitting the comments and will not consider them in the development of final regulations. All public comments on these regulations will be a matter of public record and will be available for public inspection and copying. In the interest of accuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in written form., 128854=50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; E.O. 13026, 61 FR 58767, 3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 228; E.O. 13222, 66 FR 44025, 3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 783; Notice of August 7, 2003, 68 FR 47833, 3 CFR, 2003 Comp., p. 328., 180887=(ii) May be reexported to the United States without a license,, 292080=Dated: July 28, 2004., 117490=Although the EAA expired on August 30, 2001, Executive Order 13222 of August 17, 2001 (66 FR 44025, August 22, 2001), as extended by the Notice of August 7, 2003 (68 Fed. Reg. 47833, August 11, 2003), continues the EAR in effect under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act., 73481=3 actions from July 30th, 2004 to December 10th, 2010, 180996=(iii) May be reexported to third countries subject to the license requirements for the destination, end-use or end-user set forth elsewhere in the EAR., 180756=(i) May not be transferred within Iraq to a new end-user without a license from BIS,, 181194=(3) Recordkeeping requirement. Persons in receipt of a specific license granted by OFAC described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must maintain a record of those items exported or reexported to Iraq pursuant to such specific license and record when the items are consumed or destroyed in the normal course of their use in Iraq, reexported to a third country not requiring further authorization from BIS, or returned to the United States. This requirement applies only to items subject to a license requirement under the EAR for export to Iraq as of July 30, 2004. These records must be maintained in accordance with recordkeeping requirements set forth in part 762 of the EAR and must include the following information:, 72576=This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to implement the reversion to the Department of Commerce from the Department of the Treasury of the licensing responsibility for exports and reexports to Iraq of items subject to the EAR. In addition, a license will be required for certain transfers within Iraq of items subject to the EAR. This rule is consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1483 (2003) and 1546 (2004), which lifted the comprehensive United Nations trade embargo imposed on Iraq but retained an embargo on arms and related materiel and their means of production., 92741=In addition, Section 1503 of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Pub. L. 108-11), authorized the President to make inapplicable, with respect to Iraq, Section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act and any other provision of law applicable to countries that have supported terrorism. On May 7, 2003, the President exercised this authority by the issuance of Presidential Determination 2003-23, which, among other things, suspended the application of the provisions of the Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990 (101), except section 586E (relating to penalties). In particular, the President's action suspended the requirement in section 586G(a)(3) of the Iraq Sanctions Act that items controlled under sections 5 and 6 of the Export Administration Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.) (EAA) be prohibited for export to Iraq and made inapplicable with respect to Iraq section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act and any other provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism., 204418=50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; E.O. 13222, 66 FR 44025, 3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 783; Notice of August 7, 2003, 68 FR 47833, 3 CFR, 2003 Comp., p. 328., 131820=50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; 10 U.S.C. 7420; 10 U.S.C. 7430(e); 18 U.S.C. 2510 et seq.; 22 U.S.C. 287c; 22 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.; 22 U.S.C. 6004; 30 U.S.C. 185(s), 185(u); 42 U.S.C. 2139a; 42 U.S.C. 6212; 43 U.S.C. 1354; 46 U.S.C. app. 466c; 50 U.S.C. app. 5; Sec. 901-911, Pub.

These persons include individuals and entities listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13315, as well as persons subsequently designated pursuant to criteria set forth in the order. OFAC includes the names of persons designated pursuant to E.O. 13315 in Appendix A to 31 CFR Chapter V, which lists persons subject to various sanctions programs administered by OFAC. All persons designated in or pursuant to E.O. 13315 are identified in Appendix A by the bracketed initials [IRAQ2]., 179495=(1) Validity period. Licenses issued by OFAC for the export or reexport of items that require a license to Iraq under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) shall continue to be valid under the EAR. For those licenses with specified expiration dates, such dates will continue to apply. Licenses without specified expiration dates will be valid through July 30, 2005. The recordkeeping requirements applicable to exports and reexports of items pursuant to licenses issued by OFAC are described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section., 113195=Among other things, the termination of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12722 ends the export prohibition in that and related Executive Orders and in OFAC's Iraqi Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 575. However, to facilitate a smooth transition of licensing responsibility from OFAC to BIS, this rule extends the validity of licenses issued by OFAC for Iraq. For those specific licenses with specified expiration dates, such dates will continue to apply. Licenses without specified expiration dates will be valid through July 30, 2005., 171537=Pursuant to United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions 1483 and 1546 and other relevant resolutions, the United Nations maintains an embargo on the sale or supply to Iraq of arms and related materiel and their means of production, except items required by the Interim Government of Iraq or the Multinational Force in Iraq to serve the purposes of Resolution 1546. UNSC Resolutions 707 and 687 require that Iraq eliminate its nuclear weapons program and restrict its nuclear activities to the use of isotopes for medical, industrial or agricultural purposes. Such resolutions further mandate that Iraq eliminate its chemical and biological weapons programs as well as its ballistic missile program. In support of the applicable UNSC resolutions, certain Iraq specific license requirements and licensing policies are detailed in this section. In addition, this section details restrictions on transfers of items subject to the EAR within Iraq. Exporters should be aware that other provisions of the EAR, including parts 742 and 744, will continue to apply with respect to exports and reexports to Iraq and transfers within Iraq., 92109=The President has signed an Executive Order terminating the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12722, revoking it and certain related Executive Orders. Among other things, the termination of the national emergency in those Executive Orders ends the Department of the Treasury's authority to maintain export controls pursuant to those orders and related regulations, namely the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 575. By virtue of this action, primary export licensing jurisdiction reverts to BIS., 93972=Further, on May 22, 2003, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution 1483 that lifted the comprehensive UNSC trade sanctions on Iraq while retaining restrictions on the sale or supply to Iraq of arms and related materiel and their means of production. Resolution 1483 also reiterated certain provisions of related UNSC Resolutions 707 of August 15, 1991, and 687 of April 3, 1991. In particular, those provisions require that Iraq eliminate its nuclear weapons program and restrict its nuclear activities to the use of isotopes for medical, industrial or agricultural purposes. Such provisions further mandate the elimination of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs as well as its ballistic missile program. Sale or supply by U.S. entities that would make a material contribution to any of these programs is prohibited., 115220=Consistent with Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003 (\u201cBlocking Property of the Former Iraqi Regime, its Senior Officials and Their Family Members, and Taking Certain Other Actions\u201d), this rule amends the EAR to create a new section 744.18 that creates a license requirement for exports, reexports, or transfers, of any item subject to the EAR to persons designated in or pursuant to Executive Order 13315. These persons include individuals and entities listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13315, as well as persons subsequently designated pursuant to criteria set forth in the order., 163735=(i) Persons listed in the Annex to E.O. 13315 of August 28, 2003; or, 95700=The new Iraq export licensing policy significantly reduces the level of control over commercial exports to Iraq while retaining restrictions on the export of multilaterally-controlled items and other sensitive items to Iraq in keeping with Iraq's new economic and security status. The licensing requirements and licensing policy reflected in this rule are consistent with UNSC Resolution 1483 (2003) and other relevant resolutions which lifted the comprehensive trade embargo imposed on Iraq but retained certain restrictions including an embargo on arms and related materiel and their means of production., 150876=50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; 18 U.S.C. 2510 et seq.; 22 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. 2139a; Sec. 901-911, Pub.
