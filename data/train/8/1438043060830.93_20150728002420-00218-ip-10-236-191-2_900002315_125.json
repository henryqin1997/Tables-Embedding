            "Because MSU is a big 10 school there are a ton of games to watch to cheer your Spartans on. We also have a huge variety of clubs to join to get involved in; clubs for your major or club sports and also leisure and hobby clubs for just about every interest.",
            "Depending where on campus you lived and ate the food ranged from excellent to mediocre. A few dining halls are brand new and they definitely have the best food on campus. THe older dining halls don't seem to have much selection and the food gets boring after a while.",
            "Dorm life at MSU is a great way to meet friends. I lived in West Akers and it was a fun place to live, and it was clean and well kept. my only complaint is the water that comes out of the faucet; they tell you it is safe for drinking, but it tasted metallic.",
            "I am a biochemistry and molecular biology student at MSU and I find that my classes are quite challenging. I have to work hard to keep up with the material, but its not too difficult to handle. If you stay on top of assigned homework and read chapters, i have found that it is possible to achieve good grades.",
            "Michigan State University provides a great learning environment for students of all types. The courses are challenging but the professors are always willing to help students outside of class. Big 10 athletics make campus an exciting place to be on game day, which provides for out of class entertainment."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70649=many different types of dorms are available. some house only 300 students, while others house nearly 1000. about half have community bathrooms for the entire floor, while the other half have suite-style bathrooms shared between two rooms. floors (or at least wings) are typically separated by gender, although coed floors are available. one dorm (yakeley) houses only females. dorms are arranged into complexes which all have at least one cafeteria. some classes are even held in dorm buildings; this is especially common for students in residential academic programs. dorms are constantly being updated and redone to make them pleasant places for students to live. unique residential options are also available in dorms. for example, there are honors floors for honors college students, and quiet floors with special courtesy hours. students can also choose to live in dorms with other students in their major or college. for example, science majors may choose to live in holmes, while political science students may live in case., 337968=I completed 38 credits from spring 2011 to fall 2012 all while working two jobs 40 + hours sometimes and I have a little girl. Let's say at this point I'm burnt out and scholarships would help a lot., 787033=There are many different sororities and fraternities at Michigan State. Greek Week is sometime in September or October and is a great way to meet new people and possibly join a fraternity or sorority., 1027473=MSU is in the process of building/ renovating many of their dining halls on campus. In 2010-2011, they built Brody Cafeteria, which is the largest non-military cafeteria in the world. There are always so many selections, such as, sushi, homestyle cooking, a deli, a dessert bar, a salad bar, stir fry, etc. After building that cafeteria and seeing the success rate, they began remodeling other cafeterias (at least one in each neighborhood) like that as well. The head chef of MSU Culinary Services is constantly striving to be better, despite the rising reviews every year., 69503=every meal plan is unlimited, meaning students can go to the cafeteria as many times as they want. this is especially nice for late-night snack runs and going to the cafe just to socialize. the university is in the process of updating all the cafeterias. three new cafeterias have opened since 2007, and all look similar to a large mall food court. these cafeterias give students many different meal options and are generally better than the other cafeterias. currently the cafeterias in case, brody, and snyder-phillips halls are the best. this section gets three stars because of some of the older cafeterias that have not yet been updated. the new cafeterias would get five stars. regardless of which dorm students call home, they can eat in any cafeteria. students who live off-campus can also purchase smaller meal plans, and eat on campus at their leisure., 180472=It's great. There is food all the way up until 12:00 A.M in some halls!, 1002695=If you are interested in MSU, keep your GPA up and apply early! MSU had over 30K applications and accepted only 8K for the fall of 2012., 1122862=During finals week there is this thing called the Midnight Scream. At 12:00 am every night the students on campus let out a loud scream. This scream is to relieve the stress of finals week., 335993=I'm a non-traditional student trying to complete my first degree so that I can stop working dead end jobs and help to take care of my daughter like a man should. I am a really hard worker. Working two jobs and manage to complete 38 credits without falling below a 3 point is an accomplishment I can live with, in addition I still make the time for my little girl. I would like some assistance to make life a little easier as it is a challenge. I did much of it by myself but I'm no superhero and so now I am asking for help. I have a bill now for over $1800 for this semester., 46431=currently i am enrolled for 14 credits. Monday and Wednesday and Friday i have college algebra from 10:20-11:10 and then on Monday and Wednesday i have Cse101(computer class) from 12:40 to 2:30. my math class is only challenging because i cant understand my teacher, thankfully the book text is really helpful and the online homework, extra practice and so on, really helps me understand the material i don't get in class, and there are reviews for every test. Cse101 is challenging, but I'm glad that it's giving me a broad understanding of Word, Excel, Access, And web design. Then on Tuesdays and Thursdays i have Com225 (intro to interpersonal communication) i really like this class, i have it from 10:20 to 11:40 and its taught by 2 professors that are married, steve and kelly. they are so engaging and are really cool and interesting people. then from 12:40 to 2:30 i have ISS210 (society and the individual) i really like the professor in this class too, he's very versed on the information he teaches, but you really have to pay attention to catch everything he says. its not like in highschool where you can just do the work and in the process you'll get the material, you have to be the one to motivate yourself to go to class and listen and thats how you'll understand the material. then i have Yoga from 4:10 to 5:00. 14 credits isn't too overwhelming i would say, its keeps me busy for the first half of the day, then i really have the rest of the day to do all my work and other extra-curricular activities., 171561=Michigan State is going through a remodeling process with many of the dorms around campus so the quality of living is much higher. The building I am living in was remodeled in 2011 and I love it. Most sophomores preferred to live in this building because it was more convenient than living in apartments., 202325=Apply Early! There's nothing better than feeling the stress and anxiety of the college applications process being over. It's also beneficial to you as a student to apply by the first week of November because MSU is really good about responding promptly. I received my acceptance letter within 3 weeks and it was great to know that I am already getting into schools!}",
