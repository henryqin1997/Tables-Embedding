The effective date of each community's scheduled suspension is the third date (\u201cSusp.\u201d) listed in the third column of the following tables. 44 CFR Part 64 Summary This rule identifies communities where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that are scheduled for suspension on the effective dates listed within this rule because of noncompliance with the floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives documentation that the community has adopted the required floodplain management measures prior to the effective suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will not occur and a notice of this will be provided by publication in the Federal Register on a subsequent date. Also, information identifying the current participation status of a community can be obtained from FEMA's Community Status Book (CSB). The CSB is available at http://www.fema.gov/fema/csb.shtm. 2015-05-13; vol. 80 # 92 - Wednesday, May 13, 2015 80 FR 27261 - Suspension of Community Eligibility GPO FDSys",
