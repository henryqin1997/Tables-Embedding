            "I see security around every now and then. I haven't had anything stolen so far and once, I had to leave my laptop to use the restroom. When I came back, the girl that had been sitting next to me actually waited until I came back before leaving to her next class to make sure my items were not stolen. It was very sweet of her!",
            "There are lots of clubs and activities to join. Unfortunately, I am only in BGS because as a MBA student, I am on campus mostly at night. Sometimes I do come during the day and notice there are lots of activities going on.",
            "CSULA is great if you want an affordable education and care about learning. If you don't care about learning and just want a fancy degree, try the UC system.",
            "Haven't seen anything unusual yet other than the 150 steps, but that's a good way to workout!",
            "There are lots of organizations you can join and also a gym and a game room. The gym is small but has many excellent machines.",
            "The food options are ok. There is a large cafeteria that most students like. However, I prefer to eat healthy items and there are a limited amount of healthy shops on campus. However, there are options and options is better than nothing.",
            "I am not dorming so I have no comments here.",
            "I really care about my education and about learning as much as possible to improve the success of my future. The professors here also care and if you try, you will learn a lot.",
            "If you're looking for an affordable education that will train you for the real world, CSULA is a good choice. As a UCLA undergrad, I had medium expectations for CSULA, but now that I've been here for a year, I'm glad I chose CSULA because the professors and the material are well worth my time.",
            "CSULA has excellent professors that care about their students' education. The material they teach focus on timely topics that are relevant to the real world and the professors are very responsive to inquiries via technological platforms. Though the CSULA administration system needs improvement, their teaching staff makes my overall experience in CSULA's MBA program well worth my time and money."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck As far as tuition goes, it's very adorable. Housing, on the other hand, is another story. The housing cost much more than the tuition. Did enjoy being here I have mix feelings about this. Basically, I realized the school wasn't for me. The campus was a bit too small for me and I would have enjoyed seeing a college football game but they don't have a football team. Also, I was constantly stressed out with financial aid because they are slow and confusing. When I thought I had everything done, I would receive a letter from the housing department saying that I haven't paid yet and was charged with late fees almost every month while I was attending the school. It was probably one of the main reasons I transferred out after the first quarter. But I loved my suite-mates very much. When I was faced with financial problem they were there to cheer me up. Also, you can get free scan trons and blue books at the student union. THAT was very helpful. Did learn a lot I did learn a lot and the professors are very friendly. They are also not scary so don't hesitate to ask a question. A lot of them have",
