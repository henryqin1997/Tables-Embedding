It was great in 2009, but now they are changing a lot about the college making you do unnecessary work that in my opinion isn't helping me.

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck If you're looking to save money, I can't think of better advice than to tell you to go to Hinds. I got money back. Am enjoying being here The student body is fairly friendly, the faculty is usually amazing, but it's not a large university and there is no party scene. A lot of people commute, and the campus is dead on the weekends. Am learning a lot Depending on what classes [topic, honors/nonhonors, specific teachers], there's no reason to down the curriculum just because it's a bargain school. The work is just as solid as a large university.
