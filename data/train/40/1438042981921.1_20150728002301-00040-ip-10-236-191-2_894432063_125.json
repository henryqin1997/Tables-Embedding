On a scale from 1-10, 10 being the highest, I would rate the school a 10. I can't wait until the fall of 2012 to go to school at PVAMU., 630617=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 229437=They can be a little unorganized. When I applied in 2011, they lost all of my paperwork and I had to pay money to everything sent again. The staff can be a little rude., 114481=For me it is safe. I'm an architect major and at times I'm in the architecture building at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning and I've walked back to my dorm room across campus worry free. Just lookout for the skunks because they will spray you. Also during the events they do have security outside the gates of the dorm rooms to make sure that the people that are trying to get into the dorm areas actually live there., 19039=I have visited this campus several times because I was interested in attending it in the Fall of 2009. This faculty that I have spoken with pretended like they wanted to assist me with enrolling but each time that I have attended I leave not knowing much more than when I visited. I'm very frustrated and feel that they do not want me as a student. You have to jump through hoops to get any info and they really act like they don't care. I am now looking at going to another college because of this., 607517=With the new recreational center being put up this January I plan to be in there lifting often, But as of now basketball and some on campus activities such as salsa night are fun things to do.}",
