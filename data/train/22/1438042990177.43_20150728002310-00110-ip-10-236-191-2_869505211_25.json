For more information about the WLSTProgress object, see \"WLSTProgress Object\" in Oracle WebLogic Scripting Tool. In the event of an error, the command returns a WLSTException. Updates an application configuration using a new deployment plan. The application must be fully configured and available in the WebLogic domain. Description    Use with WLST: Online Command Category: Deployment Commands updateApplication    wls:/mydomain/serverConfig> Deployment Message : no message Deployment State : completed Deployment command type: undeploy Current Status of your Deployment: Completed the undeployment of Application with status to AdminServer .> <Initiating undeploy operation for application, businessApp [archive: null], <Jul 20, 2005 9:34:15 AM EDT> <Info> <J2EE Deployment SPI> <BEA-260121> Undeploying application businessApp ... wls:/mydomain/serverConfig> undeploy('businessApp', timeout=60000)  The following example removes the businessApp application from all target servers. WLST waits 60,000 ms for the process to complete. Example       Optional. Comma-separated list of deployment options, specified as name-value pairs.

Successfully updated the application. The previous example stores the WLSTProgress object returned in a user-defined variable, in this case, progress. You can then use the progress variable to access the state of the updateApplication command.
