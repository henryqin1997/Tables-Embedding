While still being identified as either a 'submission' or a 'memorandum', papers were controlled within a single sequential numbering system. Rather than commencing with '1' this new series commenced with '1962', which was the first number after allowing for the combined total of numbers used for the issue of submissions and memoranda through the life of the First Hawke Ministry. This series is registered by the National Archives as A14039., 3032=During 1986 and 1987, the Hawke Cabinet considered 1020 memoranda., 7317=The Second Hawke Ministry, which was sworn in following the re-election of the government at the double dissolution election held in December 1984, served until the double dissolution election held in July 1987., 816=CA files of interest from 1986 and 1987 can be identified through the Archives' collection database, RecordSearch, where an application for access can also be placed online., 1099=Files for the Hawke Cabinets in 1986 and 1987, which are held in series A11116, have numbers beginning with the prefix 'CA' and are often referred to as 'CA files'., 4998=During 1986 and 1987, the Hawke Cabinet considered 814 submissions., 7561=There were two Hawke ministries and Cabinets in 1986 and 1987:, 7091=The Third Hawke Ministry was sworn in following the re-election of the government at the election held in July 1987 and served until the general election held on 24 March 1990., 1911=During 1986 and 1987 the Hawke Cabinet made 3595 decisions, of which 1193 were made without submission.}",

Details of these records can also be found on RecordSearch. To search for them choose the 'Advanced search' tab, and select the 'Commonwealth persons' box. Enter the Cabinet member's name (for example, 'Gareth Evans') into the 'Person name' field to reach the person registration, and select 'Series'., 3945=Following the election held in December 1984 a change in Cabinet office administrative practice saw the two forms of papers in which matters could be placed before Cabinet \u2013 submissions and memoranda \u2013 managed within a single record series (A14039). The two formats \u2013 the submission which was the detailed and formal information paper, and the memorandum, a briefer document often used to place supplementary or updated information on a subject before Cabinet \u2013 were retained, although they were now issued and controlled under a single sequential numbering system., 2271=Professor the Hon Gareth Evans AC QC provided context and insight into the issues, events and personalities of 1986 and 1987. Professor Evans has been Chancellor of the Australian National University since January 2010.
