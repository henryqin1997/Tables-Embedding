In one embodiment, the query node may perform some preprocessing of the query node request, for example normalization of an unnormalized query expression specified in the query node request. As indicated at 1022, the query node may determine if the query expression specified in the query node request can be satisfied from a local query cache that caches results from previous query node requests. At 1024, if the query node can be satisfied from the local query cache, then, as indicated at 1026, the query node may return query results retrieved from the local query cache to the client application in accordance with the Web service interface.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{284309=As indicated at 1050, the searchable data service may initialize a searchable index for a data store as a single partition stored on a single storage node. As indicated at 1052, over time, the partition may grow. For example, the partition may grow as storage requests are received from a client application to add searchable data service objects to the searchable index. At some point, the searchable data service may detect that the available disk space on the storage node is at or near the limits of a comfort zone for available disk space on the storage node., 288391=To replicate a partition stored by the storage node, a storage node may locate another storage node to receive a replica of the partition, as indicated at 1100. In one embodiment, the other node cooperatively volunteers to receive and store the replica. In one embodiment, the storage node that wants to replicate a partition may broadcast a message within a group of storage nodes indicating that the storage node is seeking a volunteer to receive the replica. One or more of the storage nodes that receives the message may then volunteer to store the replica. The storage node may then select a best storage node from the volunteers to store the replica, and cooperate with the selected storage node to replicate the partition to the other storage node., 136717=This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/754,777, filed Dec. 29, 2005, and which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety., 269336=As indicated at 1004, the coordinator node may determine if the service request is a query node request (a read operation to the searchable index) or a storage node request (a write operation to the searchable index, or a list attributes request). In one embodiment, a request router component of the searchable data service may perform said determining. At 1004, if the service request is a storage node request, the coordinator node may locate a storage node to receive the storage: node request, as indicated at 1006. In one embodiment, a request router component of the searchable data service may consult a local storage node locator component of the searchable data service to locate a storage node to receive the storage node request. As indicated at 1008, the coordinator node may then forward the storage node request to the determined storage node., 397383=As indicated at 1200, each node in a node group may monitor one or more usage metrics for each of one or more local resources of the node used in supporting searchable data service functionality on the node. In one embodiment, nodes in the node group may propagate usage metrics for local resources to other nodes in the node group in accordance with a gossip protocol. As indicated at 1202, one of the nodes in the node group may detect that a monitored usage metric for one of the local resources of the node has crossed a boundary of a specified comfort zone for the usage metric. As indicated at 1204, the node may communicate with at least one other node in the node group to transfer at least part of the resource usage for the local resource on the node to another node in the node group that includes a similar resource. In one embodiment, a gossip protocol and/or an anti-entropy protocol may be used in communicating with the at least one other node. Note that transferring at least part of the resource usage for the local resource to another node in the node group may move the monitored usage metric for the local resource on the node into the specified comfort zone for the usage metric on the node., 289198=As indicated at 1102, the storage nodes may then cooperatively replicate the partition to the other storage node using an anti-entropy protocol. Note that the partition may potentially be updated during the replication as storage node requests for the searchable index are received and processed. To obtain consistency between the partition and the replica, in one embodiment, the replica may be updated with received updates to the partition using a gossip protocol to propagate the updates to the other storage node, as indicated at 1104. Note that the gossip protocol may provide weak consistency between replicas of the partition. Also note that updates to replicas of a partition may continue to be performed using the gossip protocol to thus maintain weak consistency between the replicas., 274053=As indicated at 1032, each storage node that receives the query node request from the query node may search a local partition of the searchable index to locate searchable data service objects that satisfy the query expression specified by the query node request. As indicated at 1034, each of the storage nodes may then return query results that satisfy the query expression to the query node. In one embodiment, the query results may be cached in a local query cache, as indicated at 1036. The query node may merge, sort, and/or paginate the query results, as necessary or desired, as indicated at 1038. If query results are received from more than one storage node, then the query results may need to be merged. If the query results exceed a page limit, then the query results may be paginated, and then may be returned to the client application in two or more response messages. In one embodiment, the query results may be sorted according to a sort criteria specified in the query node request. In one embodiment, the query results may include at least the entity identifiers (eIDs) from each searchable data service object in the searchable index that satisfied the query expression specified in the query node request. As indicated at 1040, the query node may return the query results received from the storage node(s) to the client application in accordance with the Web service interface., 284932=To allow the searchable index to continue to grow, the partition may be repartitioned to generate two or more new partitions, as indicated at 1054. Each of the new partitions may include a different subset of the searchable data service objects in the searchable index. One or more of the new partitions may then be moved to one or more other storage nodes, thus freeing up storage space on the storage node, as indicated at 1056. In one embodiment, another node may cooperatively volunteer to receive and store a new partition. In one embodiment, the storage node that needs to move a partition may broadcast a message within a group of storage nodes indicating that the storage node needs to move the partition. One or more of the storage nodes that receive the message may then volunteer to store the partition. The storage node may then select a best storage node from the volunteers to store the partition, and may then cooperate with the selected storage node to move the partition to the other storage node. Note that the different partitions stored on the two nodes may continue to grow, and thus may be repartitioned to generate new partitions that may then be moved to other storage nodes if necessary. Repartitioning and moving partitions to other storage nodes thus allows partitions of a searchable index to grow beyond the storage limits of a single storage node. An exemplary stress management mechanism that implements a stress management algorithm for managing disk load on storage nodes in one embodiment of a searchable data service system, and that may be used to select a best storage node from among two or more volunteer storage nodes to receive a partition, is described later in this document in the section titled Stress Management., 273461=At 1024, if the query node request cannot be satisfied from the local query cache, then, as indicated at 1028, the query node may locate one or more appropriate storage nodes to receive and process the query node request. In one embodiment, the query node may consult a local storage node locator component of the searchable data service to locate the one or more storage nodes to receive the storage node request. As indicated at 1030, the query node may then forward the query node request to the determined storage node(s)., 429901=As indicated at 1300, each node in a node group may collect local health information for the node. As indicated at 1302, each node in the node group may periodically or aperiodically send a message including collected local health information for the node to at least one other node in the node group. As indicated at 1304, each node in the node group may periodically or aperiodically receive messages originating from one or more other nodes in the node group and including collected local health information for the other nodes. In one embodiment, the local health information for a node may include one or more of, but is not limited to: one or more storage resource usage metrics for a local storage resource; one or more processor usage metrics for a local processor resource; and one or more network usage metrics for a network communications resource., 270267=Upon receiving the storage node request, the storage node may modify a partition of a searchable index in accordance with the storage node request, as indicated at 1010. In one embodiment, the storage node may:, 431181=In one embodiment, the health messages may be used as heartbeat messages to detect if another node in the node group has gone offline. In this embodiment, as indicated at 1306, one of the nodes in the node group may determine that another node in the node group has gone offline if a new message including collected local health information for the other node is not received within a specified period., 271239=As indicated at 1012, changes to the partition may be propagated to one or more other storage nodes that store a replica of the modified partition. In one embodiment, the changes may be propagated to other storage nodes in accordance with a gossip protocol. In one embodiment, an anti-entropy protocol may also be used to propagate changes to other replicas of the partition. As indicated at 1014, a response indicating success or failure of the storage node request may be returned to the client application in accordance with the Web service interface.}",
