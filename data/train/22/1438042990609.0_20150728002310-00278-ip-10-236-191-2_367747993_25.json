Configuring a Server Port Server Ports You can only configure uplink Fibre Channel ports on an expansion module. The fixed module does not include uplink Fibre Channel ports. By default, Fibre Channel ports are uplink. However, you can configure them to function as Fibre Channel storage ports. This is useful in cases where a Cisco UCS requires a connection to a Direct-Attached Storage (DAS) device. Uplink Fibre Channel ports handle FCoE traffic between the fabric interconnect and the next layer of the storage area network. All network-bound FCoE traffic is pinned to one of these ports. Uplink Fibre Channel Ports You can configure uplink Ethernet ports on either the fixed module or an expansion module. Appliance FCoE Uplink Server By default, Ethernet ports are unconfigured. However, you can configure them to function in the following ways: Uplink Ethernet ports handle Ethernet traffic between the fabric interconnect and the next layer of the network.
