However, most parties are broken up by 9pm because of how hectic they get. Every year in April before finals we have something called 'Pup Cup' where freshmen and sophomores compete in sports to see which class is better. Plus there's a mini carnival during the day and good food., 27077=1. Get involved in the various clubs and activities that Assumption provides. 2. Use the tutoring center and you professors office hours, it may be the difference between an A and A-. 3. Make friends with more than one group of people, its nice to have multiple options for plans on the weekends. 4. 8:30 AM classes are worth it if your taking a class with the best professor. 5.
