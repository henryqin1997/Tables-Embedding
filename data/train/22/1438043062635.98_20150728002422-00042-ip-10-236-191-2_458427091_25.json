No. 6,468,961 to Brodbeck et al. and United States Patent Application Nos. 2004/0024069 and 2004/0151753, both to Chen et al., disclose a depot composition that includes a viscous gel formed from a polymer and a solvent. The polymer is a polylactide, polyglycolide, caprolactone-based polymer, polycaprolactone, polyanhydride, polyamine, polyurethane, polyesteramide, polyorthoester, polydioxanone, polyacetal, polyketal, polycarbonate, polyorthocarbonate, polyphosphazene, succinate, poly(malic acid), poly(amino acid), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol, polyhydroxycellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyphosphoester, polyester, polyoxaester, polybutylene terephthalate, polysaccharide, chitin, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, or copolymer, terpolymer, or mixtures thereof. The solvent includes aromatic alcohols; esters of aromatic acids, such as lower alkyl or aralkyl esters of aryl acids; aromatic ketones, such as aryl, aralkyl, or lower alkyl ketones; and mixtures thereof., 26576=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/650,225, filed Feb. 3, 2005., 68086=The suspension formulation including the suspension vehicle and the omega-INF particles was prepared in a dry box under nitrogen. A hot plate was moved into the dry box and preheated to 60\ufffd C. Appropriate amounts of the omega-INF and the suspension vehicle were weighed into a glass beaker. Using a stainless steel spatula, the omega-INF particles were manually incorporated into the suspension vehicle while warming the suspension vehicle with the hotplate. The suspension formulation was mixed by hand for 15 minutes. The suspension formulation included 1:2:1 omega-INF:sucrose:methionine by weight with 25 mM citrate buffer. The particle loading of omega-INF in the suspension was approximately 10%, which is equivalent to a drug loading of approximately 1.7%. This is consistent with a unit dose of 25 \u03bcg/day of the omega-INF., 31427=United States Patent Application No. 2003/0108609 to Berry et al. discloses a stable, nonaqueous single phase viscous vehicle that includes at least two of a polymer, a solvent, and a surfactant. The vehicle suspends a beneficial agent, which is deliverable at a low flow rate and at body temperature from an implantable drug delivery device. The solvent includes carboxylic acid esters, polyhydric alcohols, polymers of polyhydric alcohols, fatty acids, oils, lauryl alcohol, or esters of polyhydric alcohols. The polymer includes polyesters, pyrrolidones, esters or ethers of unsaturated alcohols, or polyoxyethylenepolyoxypropylene block copolymers. The vehicle is well suited to preparing suspensions that include biomolecular beneficial agents and are stable over extended periods of time, even at elevated temperatures. However, under certain circumstances, a formulation of the vehicle and the beneficial agent may have the potential to inhibit delivery of the beneficial agent into the desired environment of operation. In particular, when the formulation is exposed to an aqueous liquid, such as a physiological fluid, within a delivery conduit of a device used to deliver the formulation, the polymer in the vehicle tends to phase separate from the solvent into the aqueous liquid. As the polymer partitions into the aqueous liquid, the concentration of the polymer within the aqueous liquid may increase to such an extent that a highly viscous polymer gel is formed within the delivery conduit, which results in a partial or complete occlusion of the delivery conduit and interferes with the desired operation of the delivery device. The potential for such occlusions increases where the geometry of the delivery conduit is such that aqueous liquid interfaces with the drug formulation in a confined area over a relatively long period of time (e.g., hours or days)., 84707=The omega-INF was prepared as described in Example 1, except that the final target composition of the omega-INF particles was 1:2:1:2.15 (omega-INF:sucrose:methionine:citrate). Each suspension formulation had a target particle loading of approximately 10% (w/w). The incorporation of the omega-INF particles into the suspension vehicle was conducted in a Scott Turbon Mixer in 25 g lots. Following deaeration, the samples were filled in 10 mL syringes and sealed in polyethylene and polyfoil pouches. Samples of the suspension formulations were stored refrigerated until filling., 53553=The active agent used in the suspension formulation may be provided as a stabilized, dry powder that is produced by spray-drying, freeze-drying, a supercritical fluid process, dessication, granulation, grinding, milling, precipitation, homogenization, or a coating process, as known in the art. To provide the active agent as the dry powder, the active agent may be formulated with one or more adjuvants, excipients, stabilizers, bulking agents, preservatives, or coating agents, as known in the art. For instance, the active agent may be formulated with at least one of citrate, histidine, succinate, methionine, sucrose, and dextran. In one embodiment, the suspension formulation includes omega-INF:sucrose:methionine:citrate at a ratio of 1:2:1:2.15.}",

The 72 systems in groups 1 through 12 were sent for N-ray imaging prior to testing in vitro to provide a greater level of detail about the systems than can be provided by X-ray due to the superior resolution of the contents of the implant when N-ray is performed. The membrane side of the implant was immersed in phosphate buffered saline at neutral pH containing 0.2% sodium azide.
