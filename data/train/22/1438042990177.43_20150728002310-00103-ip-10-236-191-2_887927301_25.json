    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6471=The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society and television, and many aspects of the human condition.[1] The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a family and named the characters after members of his own, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987.[2] After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox.[3], 3491=The Simpsons holds several American television longevity records. It is the longest-running prime time animated series and longest-running sitcom in the United States.[4] In May 2007, The Simpsons reached its 400th episode at the end of the eighteenth season.[5] The year 2007 marked the twentieth anniversary of The Simpsons franchise. With its twenty-second season (2010\u20132011) concluded, the series has surpassed Gunsmoke in seasons to claim the spot as the longest-running American prime-time scripted television series. However, Gunsmoke's episode count of 635 episodes far surpasses The Simpsons.[6] 2009 marked the 20th anniversary of the half-hour series.[7] Episodes of The Simpsons have won dozens of awards, including 27 Emmy Awards (with ten for Outstanding Animated Program),[8] 27 Annie Awards[9] and a Peabody Award.[10], 1300=Since its debut on December 17, 1989 the show has broadcast 574 episodes and the twenty-sixth season began airing on September 28, 2014.[11] The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27, 2007, and grossed US$526.2 million worldwide.[12] Currently, the first fourteen seasons are available on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4 with the twentieth season released on both DVD and Blu-ray on January 12, 2010 in Region 1[13] and on January 20, 2010 in Region 4.}",
