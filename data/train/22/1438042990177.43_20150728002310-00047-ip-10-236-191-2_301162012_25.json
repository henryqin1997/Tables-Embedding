The Standard Size Wide Range has several line class records and is a tuna killer! This lure can be trolled over a \u201cWide Range\u201d of speeds from 4-14 knots (hence the name), and this lure is SUPER in rough water. The Wide Range is responsible for breaking Blue Marlin records in Venezuela, Puerto Rico and Africa. In Hawaii, it is one of the favorites of many boat captains. The larger heavier head gives the lure more stability at high speeds and rough water.
