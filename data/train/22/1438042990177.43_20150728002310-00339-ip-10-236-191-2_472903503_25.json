    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6117=DNA analysis was carried out by Southern blot hybridization. DNA was isolated from the clones as described Laird et al. (Laird, P. W. et al., (1991) Nucleic Acids Res. 19: 4293). Isolated genomic DNA was digested with SpeI and probed with a 915 bp SacI fragment, probe A (FIG. 6), which hybridizes to a sequence between the mu intronic enhancer and the mu switch region. Probe A detects a 9.9 kb SpeI fragment from the wild type locus, and a diagnostic 7.6 kb band from a mu locus which has homologously recombined with the CMD targeting vector (the neo expression cassette contains a SpeI site). Of 1132 G418 and FIAU resistant clones screened by Southern blot analysis, 3 displayed the 7.6 kb Spe I band indicative of homologous recombination at the mu locus. These 3 clones were further digested with the enzymes BglI, BstXI, and EcoRI to verify that the vector integrated homologously into the mu gene. When hybridized with probe A, Southern blots of wild type DNA digested with BglI, BstXI, or EcoRI produce fragments of 15.7, 7.3, and 12.5 kb, respectively, whereas the presence of a targeted mu allele is indicated by fragments of 7.7, 6.6, and 14.3 kb, respectively. All 3 positive clones detected by the SpeI digest showed the expected BglI, BstXI, and EcoRI restriction fragments diagnostic of insertion of the neo cassette into the Cmul exon.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{86790=Nucleic acids encoding antibody chains to be displayed optionally flanked by spacers are inserted into the genome of a display package as discussed above by standard recombinant DNA techniques (see generally, Sambrook, et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989, incorporated by reference herein). The nucleic acids are ultimately expressed as antibody chains (with or without spacer or framework residues). In phage, bacterial and spore vectors, antibody chains are fused to all or part of the an outer surface protein of the replicable package. Libraries often have sizes of about 103, 104, 105, 10 6, 107, 108 or more members., 522795=Samples to be analyzed were diluted 1:4.5 in conjugate diluent (CD8; 10 mM Tris, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 0.1 mM zinc chloride, 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide, at pH 8.15). Standard curves were created using samples of either conjugate diluent or pooled normal plasma with various concentrations of interleukin-8 (IL-8) added. 40 \u03bcl of 2 \u03bcg/ml biotinylated polyclonal murine antibody, polyclonal human antibody or monoclonal human antibody M1-10 in CD8 were pipetted into individual microplate wells. The microplate was incubated for 1 hour at 25\ufffd C. and individual wells were washed three times with wash buffer (20 mM borate, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.02% polyoxyethylene 20-sorbitan monolaurate, 0. 1% sodium azide, at pH 8.2) in overflow mode. 40 \u03bcl of the sample to be analyzed was pipetted into individual microplate wells, and the plate was incubated for 1 hour at 25\ufffd C. Individual microplate wells were washed three times with wash buffer, and 40 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcg/ml alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibody in CD8 was pipetted into individual microplate wells. Polyclonal murine antibody-AP, polyclonal human antibody-AP, and monoclonal human antibody M1-25-AP were paired with polyclonal murine antibody-biotin, polyclonal human antibody -biotin, and monoclonal human antibody M1-10-biotin, respectively. The microplate was incubated for 1 hour at 25\ufffd C. and individual wells were washed six times with wash buffer. 40 \u03bcl of 1 mM AttoPhos substrate in 2.4 M diethanolamine, 0.057 mM magnesium chloride, 0.005% sodium azide at pH 10.0 was pipetted into each microplate well, and the kinetic fluorescence was read for 20 minutes. Samples known to contain human-anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) or heterophilic antibodies were purchased (Scantibodies, Inc., Santee, Calif.). All HAMA-positive and standard curve samples were analyzed in quadruplicate., 44052=Specific binding between an antibody or other binding agent and an antigen means a binding affinity of at least 106 M\u22121. Preferred binding agents bind with affinities of at least about 107 M\u22121, and preferably 108 M\u22121 to 109 M\u22121, 1010 M\u22121, 1011 M\u22121, or 1012 M\u22121. The term epitope means an antigenic determinant capable of specific binding to an antibody. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and nonconformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents., 198696=The H chain ss-PCR products and the L chain ss-PCR products were separately pooled and ethanol precipitated by adding 2.5 volumes ethanol and 0.2 volumes 7.5 M ammonium acetate and incubating at \u221220\ufffd C. for at least 30 min. The DNA was pelleted by centrifuging at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 2-8\ufffd C. The supernatant was carefully aspirated, and the tubes were briefly spun a 2nd time. The last drop of supernatant was removed with a pipet. The DNA was dried in vacuo for 10 min on medium heat. The H chain products were dissolved in 210 \u03bcL water and the L chain products were dissolved separately in 210 mL water. The ss-DNA was purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Hewlett Packard 1090 HPLC and a Gen-Pak\u2122 FAX anion exchange column (Millipore Corp., Milford, Mass.). The gradient used to purify the ss-DNA is shown in Table 1, and the oven temperature was at 60\ufffd C. Absorbance was monitored at 260 nm. The ss-DNA eluted from the HPLC was collected in 0.5 min fractions. Fractions containing ss-DNA were pooled, ethanol precipitated, pelleted and dried as described above. The dried DNA pellets were resuspended in 200 \u03bcL sterile water., 56680=Inefficiencies and limitations of prior methods of generating human antibodies relative to mouse antibodies are overcome by the disclosure of new methods for producing indefinite numbers of human antibodies having extraordinarily high binding affinities and multiple epitope specificities. Examples of the affinities of human antibodies produced by these methods are described in Example 21. Evidence that the antibodies bind to a number of different epitopes is provided by Example 27. The use of high affinity antibodies as detection reagents is desirable because it allows washing to be conducted at higher stringency and consequently results in a higher signal to noise ratio. Use of antibodies binding to different epitopes is advantageous in sandwich detection formats. Using the methods disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 60/157,415, filed Oct. 2, 1999, and reproduced in the present application, high affinity human antibodies, optionally binding to different epitopes, can be generated with comparable facility to that of mouse antibodies generated by Milstein-Kohler technology., 257459=The PCR reaction was performed as in Example 3 on a 4\ufffd100 \u03bcl scale; the reactions containing 100 pmol of 5\u2032 primer (K), 1 pmol of the inner 3\u2032 primer (L), and 100 pmol of outer 3\u2032 primer (M), 10 \u03bcl 2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 \u03bcL Taq DNA Polymerase, 10 \u03bcl 10\ufffdTaq DNA polymerase buffer with MgCl2, and H2O to 100 \u03bcL. The araCparaBAD PCR product was precipitated and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and full-length products excised from the gel, purified, resuspended in water, and prepared for cloning by digestion with EcoRI and HindIII as described earlier. The pBR vector (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.) was prepared to receive this insert by digestion with EcoR! and HindIII and purification by agarose gel electrophoresis as described above. The insert and vector were mixed (2:1 molar ratio) together with 1 \u03bcl 10 mM ATP, 1 \u03bcl (1 U/\u03bcl) T4 DNA ligase, 1 \u03bcl 10\ufffd ligase buffer in a final volume of 10, and ligated overnight at 15\ufffd C. The ligation reaction was diluted to 20 \u03bcl, and 1 \u03bcl electroporated into electrocompetent E. coli strain, DH10B (Example 8), plated on LB tetracycline (10 \u03bcg/ml) plates and grown overnight at 37\ufffd C. Clones were picked and grown overnight in 3 ml LB broth supplemented with tetracycline., 146565=Human antibodies for use in detection methods of the invention are preferably produced using the methods described above. The methods result in virtually unlimited numbers of human antibodies of any epitope binding specificity and very high binding affinity to any desired antigen. In general, the higher the binding affinity of an antibody for its target, the more stringent wash conditions can be performed in an immunoassay to remove nonspecifically bound material without removing target antigen. According, human antibodies used in the above assays usually have binding affinities of at least 108, 109, 1010, 1011 or 1012 M\u22121. Further, it is desirable that antibodies used as detection reagents have a sufficient on-rate to reach equilibrium under standard conditions such as those described in Example 28 in at least 12 hours, preferably at least five hours and more preferably at least one hour., 550583=The polyclonal phage specific to oxidized troponin I was generally selected as described in Example 31 with the following changes. The phage libraries were made from RNA isolated from 5 HCo7 mice, oxidized troponin biotin (Example 30) was used at a final concentration of 10\u22129M for each round of selection, and high salt conjugate diluent (1% bovine serum albumin (from 30% BSA, Bayer, Kankakee, Ill.), 10 mM MOPS, 650 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 0.25% casein, 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol (80% hydrolyzed, Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.), pH 7.0) was used instead of the panning buffer. The phage library was subcloned after 5 rounds of functional panning using oligonucleotides 1161 and 1182 to amplify the antibody cassette., 58540=Methods for producing human antibodies are described in copending application U.S. Ser. No. 60/157,415, filed Oct. 2, 1999. These methods include the trioma technology of Ostberg et al. (1983), Hybridoma 2:361\u2013367 and Engelman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,634,666, phage display methods and nonhuman transgenic mice expressing genes of the human immune system. Preferred methods are reproduced below. The methods typically work by immunizing a nonhuman transgenic animal having human immunoglobulin genes. The animal expresses a diverse range of human antibodies that bind to the antigen. Nucleic acids encoding the antibody chain components of such antibodies are then cloned from the animal into a display vector. Typically, separate populations of nucleic acids encoding heavy and light chain sequences are cloned, and the separate populations then recombined on insertion into the vector, such that any given copy of the vector receives a random combination of a heavy and light chains. The vector is designed to express antibody chains so that they can be assembled and displayed on the outersurface of a display package containing the vector. For example, antibody chains can be expressed as fusion proteins with a phage coat protein from the outersurface of the phage. Thereafter, display packages can be screened for display of antibodies binding to a target., 557227=The monoclonal antibodies that bound to IL-8 could be classified in two groups. The first group comprising the antibodies MED002.1.10, MED002. 1.25.1.4, MED002.1.25.1.5, and MED002.1.25.1.9 binds to a single epitope on IL-8 because none of the pairwise combinations of these antibodies results in a sandwich assay response proportional to the concentration of target antigen. The second group comprising the antibodies MED002.1.25, MED002.1.4, MED002.1.3, and MED002.1.5 binds to a single epitope also because none of the pairwise combinations of these antibodies results in a sandwich assay response proportional to the concentration of target antigen. The epitope bound by the first group of antibodies is different from the epitope bound by the second group of antibodies and these two epitopes are sufficiently separated from one another to allow all possible pairwise combinations of monoclonal antibodies, one from the first group and the second from the second group, to function in a sandwich assay that exhibits a response proportional to the concentration of target antigen., 494593=The resulting plasmid was linearized with Not I, and a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) cassette was inserted to allow for enrichment of ES clones (mouse embryo-derived stem cells) bearing homologous recombinants, as described by Mansour et al. (1988) Nature 336: 348\u2013352. This cassette consists of the coding sequences of the tk gene bracketed by the mouse pgk promoter and polyadenylation site, as described by Tybulewicz et al. (1991) Cell 65: 1153\u20131163. The resulting CMD targeting vector contains a total of approximately 5.3 kb of homology to the heavy chain locus and is designed to generate a mutant mu gene into which has been inserted a neo expression cassette in the unique SmaI site of the first Cmu exon. The targeting vector was linearized with PvuI, which cuts within plasmid sequences, prior to electroporation into ES cells., 266310=Monoclonal antibodies were obtained by picking individual colonies off the LB agar plates supplemented with tetracycline used to measure the subcloning efficiency or from plates streaked with cells from the glycerol freezer stocks. The picks were incubated overnight at 37\ufffd C., 300 rpm in a shake flask containing 2\ufffdYT media and 10 \u03bcg/mL tetracyclin. Glycerol freezer stocks were made for each monoclonal for long term storage at \u221280\ufffd C. A total of 15 different colonies were picked off of the 109 affinity cut and analyzed for binding to IL8. Of those 15 clones, two expressed a very low amount of antibody, one expressed antibody but did not bind IL8, two expressed functional antibody but the DNA sequence was ambiguous most likely due to sequence template quality, and one expressed functional protein but was not sequenced. Nine clones were sequenced as described in Example 22. A total of 21 different colonies were picked off of the 1010 affinity cut and analyzed for binding to IL8. Of those 21 clones, four expressed a very low amount of antibody, three expressed antibody but did not bind IL8, and four expressed functional protein but were not sequenced. Ten clones were sequenced as described in Example 22., 37966=Human antibodies used in such methods typically have affinities of at least 108 M\u22121, 109 M\u22121, 1010 M\u22121, 1011 M\u22121, 1012 M\u22121 for the analyte. Some human antibodies used in the methods are produced by expression of a recombinant construct in E. coli. Some such antibodies have immunoreactivities of at least 90%., 32307=U.S. Pat. No. 6,794,132, filed Dec. 1, 1999, WO98/47343, filed, Apr. 3, 1998, U.S. Pat. No. 6,555,310, filed Apr. 4, 1997 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,057,098, filed Apr. 4, 1997 are directed to related subject matter, and each is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes., 241204=The 5th round antibody phage was set up in triplicate as described above using 950 \u03bcL panning buffer, 50 \u03bcL 5th round antibody phage per sample with the experimental (foreground) tubes receiving 10 \u03bcL 10\u22127M interleukin-8-biotin or 10 \u03bcL 10\u22128M interleukin-8-biotin, respectively. The third tube did not receive any interleukin-8-biotin. This round of panning or affinity selection preferentially selects for antibodies of \u2267109 affinity and \u22671010 affinity by including the interleukin-8-biotin at a final concentration of 10\u22129 M and 10\u221210 M, respectively. After greater than 24 hours at 2\u20138\ufffd C., the phage samples were panned with avidin magnetic latex and processed as described above. The 6th round antibody phage sample 10\u22129 M cut had a foreground:background ratio 1018:1 and the 10\u221210 M cut had a foreground:background ratio 225:1., 176252=The spleens were harvested in a laminar flow hood and transferred to a petri dish, trimming off and discarding fat and connective tissue. The spleen was, working quickly, macerated with the plunger from a sterile 5 cc syringe in the presence of 1.0 ml of solution D (25.0 g guanidine thiocyanate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Ind.), 29.3 ml sterile water, 1.76 ml 0.75 M sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 2.64 ml 10% sarkosyl (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.), 0.36 ml 2-mercaptoethanol (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.)). The spleen suspension was pulled through an 18-gauge needle until viscous and all cells were lysed, then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The petri dish was washed with 100 11 of solution D to recover any remaining spleen, and this was transferred to the tube. The suspension was then pulled through a 22-gauge needle an additional 5\u201310 times. The sample was divided evenly between two microcentrifuge tubes and the following added in order, with mixing by inversion after each addition: 100 \u03bcl 2 M sodium acetate (pH 4.0), 1.0 ml water-saturated phenol (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.), 200 \u03bcl chloroform/isoamyl alcohol 49:1 (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.). The solution was vortexed for 10 seconds and incubated on ice for 15 min. Following centrifugation at 14 krpm for 20 min at 2\u20138\ufffd C., the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube. An equal volume of water saturated phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1) was added, and the tube was vortexed for ten seconds. After a 15 min incubation on ice, the sample was centrifuged for 20 min at 2\u20138\ufffd C., and the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol at \u221220\ufffd C. for a minimum of 30 min. Following centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4\ufffd C., the supernatant was aspirated away, the tubes briefly spun and all traces of liquid removed. The RNA pellets were each dissolved in 300 \u03bcl of solution D, combined, and precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol at \u221220\ufffd C. for a minimum of 30 min. The sample was centrifuged 14, 000 rpm for 20 min at 4\ufffd C., the supernatant aspirated as before, and the sample rinsed with 100 \u03bcl of ice-cold 70% ethanol. The sample was again centrifuged 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4\ufffd C., the 70% ethanol solution aspirated, and the RNA pellet dried in vacuo. The pellet was resuspended in 100 \u03bcl of sterile distilled water. The concentration was determined by A260 using an absorbance of 1.0 for a concentration of 40 \u03bcg/ml. The RNA was stored at \u221280\ufffd C., 143160=The above methods result in novel libraries of nucleic acid sequences encoding antibody chains having specific affinity for a chosen target. The libraries of nucleic acids typically have at least 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 1000, 104 or 105 different members. Usually, no single member constitutes more than 25 or 50% of the total sequences in the library. Typically, at least 25, 50%, 75, 90, 95, 99 or 99.9% of library members encode antibody chains with specific affinity for the target molecules. In the case of double chain antibody libraries, a pair of nucleic acid segments encoding heavy and light chains respectively is considered a library member. The nucleic acid libraries can exist in free form, as components of any vector or transfected as a component of a vector into host cells., 261789=The polyclonal IL8 antibody phage form both the 109 and 1010 affinity cuts (see Example 13) were diluted 1/30 in 2\ufffdYT and 1 \u03bcl used as template for PCR amplification of the antibody gene inserts with primers 197 (Example 5) and 970 (see below). PCR (3\u2013100 \u03bcL reactions) was performed using a high-fidelity PCR system, Expand (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Ind.) to minimize errors incorporated into the DNA product. Each 100 \u03bcl reaction contained 100 pmol of 5\u2032 primer 197, 100 pmol of 3\u2032 primer 970, 0.7 units of Expand DNA polymerase, 10 \u03bcl 2 mM dNTPs, 10 \u03bcl 10\ufffd Expand reaction buffer, 1 \u03bcl diluted phage stock as template, and water to 100 \u03bcl. The reaction was carried out in a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler (Model 9600) using the following thermal profile: one cycle of denaturation at 94\ufffd C. (1 min); ten cycles of denaturation (15 sec, 94\ufffd C.), annealing (30 sec, 55\ufffd C.), elongation (60 sec, 72\ufffd C.); fifteen cycles of denaturation (15 sec, 94\ufffd C.), annealing (30 sec, 55\ufffd C.), elongation (80 sec plus 20 sec for each additional cycle, 72\ufffd C.); elongation (6 min, 72\ufffd C.); soak (4\ufffd C., indefinitely). The PCR products were ethanol precipitated, pelleted and dried as described above. The DNA was dissolved in water and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Only full-length products were excised from the gel, purified, and resuspended in water as described earlier., 488209=A shake flask inoculum is generated overnight from a \u221270\ufffd C. cell bank in an Innova 4330 incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, N.J.) set at 37\ufffd C., 300 rpm. The inoculum is used to seed a 20 L fermenter (Applikon, Foster City, Calif.) containing defined culture medium (Pack, et al., Bio/Technology 11:1271\u20131277 (1993)) supplemented with 3 g/L L-leucine, 3 g/L L-isoleucine, 12 g/L casein digest (Difco, Detroit, Mich.), 12.5 g/L glycerol and 10 mg/ml tetracycline. The temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen in the fermenter are controlled at 26\ufffd C., 6.0\u20136.8 and 25% saturation, respectively. Foam is controlled by addition of polypropylene glycol (Dow, Midland, Mich.). Glycerol is added to the fermenter in a fed-batch mode. Fab expression is induced by addition of L(+)-arabinose (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) to 2 g/L during the late logarithmic growth phase. Cell density is measured by optical density at 600 nm in an UV-1201 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Columbia, Md.). Final Fab concentrations are typically 100\u2013500 mg/L. Following run termination and adjustment of pH to 6.0, the culture is passed twice through an M-210B-EH Microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, Mass.) at 17000 psi. The high pressure homogenization of the cells releases the Fab into the culture supernatant., 60581=After prescreening with receptor (if any) and screening with target, display packages binding to the target are isolated, and optionally, subject to further rounds screening to target, with each such round optionally being preceded by prescreening to receptor. Display packages are typically amplified between rounds of screening to target but not between prescreening and screening steps. After one or a few rounds of screening to target, the remaining display packages are highly enriched for high affinity binders to the target. For example, as shown in Example 13, it is possible to isolate large numbers of different antibodies having affinities in excess of 109 or 1010 M\u22121. Furthermore, the conditions of screening can be controlled to select antibodies having affinity in excess of a chosen threshold., 168604=Arrays for use in transcriptional profiling or gene expression and for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms have different nucleic acids immobilized at different known locations. Generally, such arrays include many immobilized oligonucleotides that are designed to bind to their homologous targets with high affinity (see e.g., Microarray Biochip Technology (ed. M. Schena, Eaton Publishing Massachusetts, 2000)). Because the affinity of the two strands in a DNA hybrid can be substantially higher than the affinity of two proteins that bind to one another, the conditions that can be employed to insure that the binding event is specific can be quite stringent to insure that non-specific binding is minimized. In addition, the known effect of temperature on hybridization reactions can be exploited to increase specificity. Using antibody arrays, the stringency of selection that can be achieved depends on the affinity of antibody reagents for their targets. Therefore, high affinity antibodies are advantageous for such arrays. For example, some arrays bear antibodies with affinities of at least 108, 109, 1010, 1011 or 1012 M\u22121. Use of antibodies with high affinities avoids the need to use multimer forms of antibodies for the increased avidity provided by multimeric bonding to the same antigen. The use of multimeric forms of antibody is limited to types of target having multiple copies of an epitope bound by the antibody. Because the Law of Mass Action determines the proportion of antibodies that bind to a target antigen at equilibrium, the antibody concentration is, in general, kept above the dissociation constant of that antibody/target antigen pair. In immunoassays, the target antigen concentration is often at or below the dissociation constant in a sample and this requires the antibody concentration to be present in excess over the dissociation constant in order to bind a substantial fraction of the available target antigen. The use of such high concentrations of antibody causes other non-specific binding reactions to become significant and to contribute to falsely elevated responses in the assay of a target antigen. In arrays, where the mixture of immobilized antibodies (and antibodies labeled for detection in some formats) may be contacted with the sample in a single solution the problem of non-specific binding is compounded by the multiplicity of antibodies, all being used at high concentrations. The HAMA or heterophilic antibody problem is particularly enhanced by the high concentrations of antibodies typically employed in arrays. The use of human antibodies in antibody arrays for the detection of target antigens substantially reduces or eliminates the HAMA or heterophilic antibody problem encountered when assaying human samples., 81964=The genetic packages most frequently used for display libraries are bacteriophage, particularly filamentous phage, and especially phage M13, Fd and F1. Most work has inserted libraries encoding polypeptides to be displayed into either gIII or gVIII of these phage forming a fusion protein. See, e.g., Dower, WO 91/19818; Devlin, W0 91/18989; MacCafferty, WO 92/01047 (gene III); Huse, W0 92/06204; Kang, WO 92/18619 (gene VIII). Such a fusion protein comprises a signal sequence, usually from a secreted protein other than the phage coat protein, a polypeptide to be displayed and either the gene I or gene VIII protein or a fragment thereof. Exogenous coding sequences are often inserted at or near the N-terminus of gene III or gene VIII although other insertion sites are possible. Some filamentous phage vectors have been engineered to produce a second copy of either gene III or gene VIII. In such vectors, exogenous sequences are inserted into only one of the two copies. Expression of the other copy effectively dilutes the proportion of fusion protein incorporated into phage particles and can be advantageous in reducing selection against polypeptides deleterious to phage growth. In another variation, exogenous polypeptide sequences are cloned into phagemid vectors which encode a phage coat protein and phage packaging sequences but which are not capable of replication. Phagemids are transfected into cells and packaged by infection with helper phage. Use of phagemid system also has the effect of diluting fusion proteins formed from coat protein and displayed polypeptide with wild type copies of coat protein expressed from the helper phage. See, e.g., Garrard, WO 92/09690., 32702=The invention provides methods of detecting an analyte using a human antibodies. Such methods entail contacting a sample with a human antibody immobilized to a support, the antibody having an affinity of at least 108M\u22121 for an analyte, and detecting binding of the human antibody to the analyte indicating presence and/or amount of the analyte in the sample. In some methods, the human antibody has a binding affinity of at least 1010 M\u22121 or 1011 M\u22121. In some methods, the support bears a plurality of different human antibodies the different human antibodies occupying different known locations on the support. In some methods, the sample is contacted with a plurality of human antibodies immobilized to a plurality of supports, each of the human antibodies having an affinity of at least 108 M\u22121 and the detecting step comprises detecting binding of at least two of the human antibodies to at least two analytes to indicate presence and/or amount of the analytes in the sample. In some methods, the human antibody is labelled. In some methods, the human antibody is unlabelled and the detecting step is performed by mass spectrometry or surface plasmon resonance. In some methods, the sample comprises an unlabelled form of analyte to be detected and a labelled form of analyte, and the detecting step detects binding of the human antibody to the labelled form of the analyte, the extent of binding being inversely related to the amount of unlabelled analyte in the sample. In some methods, the human antibody is labelled, and sample comprises a test form of the analyte to be detected, and a control form of the analyte to compete with the test form of the analyte for binding to the human antibody, and the detecting step detects binding of the labelled antibody to the test form of the analyte. In some methods, the is sample is further contacted with a human antibody in solution, the immobilized human antibody and the human antibody in solution binding to different epitopes of the same analyte, and the detecting step comprising detecting binding of the immobilized human antibody and/or the human antibody in solution to the analyte. In some methods, the detecting comprises detecting binding of at least two of the antibodies to at least two analytes in the sample. In some methods, the sample is a mixture of a first sample bearing different analytes labelled with a first label and a second sample bearing different analytes labelled with a second label, the detecting comprises detecting a ratio of first label to second label bound to a plurality of antibodies, to indicate ratios of amounts of analytes present in the first and second samples. In some methods, less than 500 ng or 100 ng of human In some methods, the plurality of human antibodies comprises at least 100 different antibodies having specific affinities for different analytes that may be present in the sample. In some methods, the plurality of human antibodies comprises at least 1000 different antibodies having specific affinities for different analytes that may be present in the sample. In some methods, the specific affinities of the different antibodies for the different analytes fall within a factor of ten of each other. In some methods, the sample is a sample from a human subject. In some methods, the sample contains HAMA and/or heterophilic antibodies., 173036=In some arrays, antibodies are immobilized in small known locations on a substrate. The use of high affinity antibodies is advantageous in achieving small areas in that less antibody need be used in each location to detect a given concentration of analyte. For example, in some arrays, the amount of antibody immobilized in each known location is less than 500 or 100 ng. The use of human antibodies is advantageous for immobilization in small areas, because HAMA and heterophilic antibody interference does not increase significantly with the density of antibody molecules within a known location. In consequence, antibodies can be immobilized in known locations, each having an area less than 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001 cm2. In view of the small areas occupied by each different human antibody on a support, the number of different human antibodies that can be immobilized to the same support can be large. For example, 50, 100, 1000, 100,000 or 1,000,00 human antibodies can be immobilized to the same support., 269721=IL8 was further purified by the following procedure. The protein was dialyzed exhaustively against 10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.35, and diluted 1:3 with 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.35. This material was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.) equilibrated in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 40 mM NaCl. The IL8 was contained in the flow through fraction. By SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis, the IL8 was greater than 95% pure. The IL8 was brought to 120 mM NaCl and 0.01% NaN3 and stored at \u221280\ufffd C., 78170=Nucleic acids encoding at least the variable regions of heavy and light chains can be cloned from either immunized or naive transgenic animals. Nucleic acids can be cloned as genomic or cDNA from lymphatic cells of such animals. The spleen is a preferred source of such cells. No immortalization of such cells is required prior to cloning of immunoglobulin sequences. Usually, mRNA is isolated and amplified by reverse transcription with polydT primers. The cDNA is then amplified using primers to conserved regions of human immunoglobulins. Although populations of light and heavy chains can be amplified separately from each, the light chains within the light chain population are amplified en masse as are the heavy chains within the heavy chain population. Typically, the amplified population of light chains comprises at least 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000 or 1,000,000 different light chains. Likewise, the amplified population of heavy chains comprises at least 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000 or 1,000,000 different heavy chains., 129950=Enriched libraries produced by the above methods are characterized by a high proportion of members encoding polypeptides having specific affinity for the target. For example, at least 10, 25, 50, 75, 80, 90, 95, or 99% of members encode polypeptides having specific affinity for the target. In some libraries, at least 10, 25, 50, 75, 80, 90, 95, or 99% of members have affinities of at least 108 M\u22121, 109 M\u22121 or 1010 M\u22121. In libraries of double chain antibodies, a pair of segments encoding heavy and light chains of an antibody is considered a library member. The exact percentage of members having affinity for the target depends whether the library has been amplified following selection, because amplification increases the representation of genetic deletions. However, among members with full-length polypeptide coding sequences, the proportion encoding polypeptides with specific affinity for the target is very high (e.g., at least 50, 75, 80, 90, 95 or 99% having affinity of 108 M\u22121, 109 M\u22121 or 1010 M\u22121. Not all of the library members that encode an antibody chain with specific affinity for the target necessarily display the antibody chain. For example, in a library in which 95% of members with full-length coding sequences encode antibody chains with specific affinity for the target, usually fewer than half actually display the antibody chain. Usually, such libraries have at least 4, 10, 20, 50, 100, 1000, 10,000 or 100,000 different coding sequences. Usually, the representation of any one such coding sequences is no more than 50%, 25% or 10% of the total coding sequences in the library., 549820=The polyclonal phage specific to C-reactive protein was generally selected as described in Example 31 with the following changes. The phage libraries were made from RNA isolated from 3 HCo7 mice and 2 HCo12 mice, C-reactive protein biotin (Example 30) was used at a final concentration of 10\u22129M for each round of selection, and the panning buffer did not contain CaCl2. The phage library was subcloned after 5 rounds of functional panning using oligonucleotides 1161 and 1182 to amplify the antibody cassette., 510495=Alkaline phosphatase (AP, Calzyme Laboratories, San Luis Obispo, Calif.) was placed into dialysis using a minimum of 100 volumes of column buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, 10 mM borate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0) at 2\u20138\ufffd C. for at least four hours. The buffer was changed at least twice prior to use of the AP. When the AP was removed from dialysis and brought to room temperature, the concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an absorbance of 0.77 for a 1 mg/mL solution. The AP was diluted to 5 mg/mL with column buffer. The reaction of AP and succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.) was carried out using a 20:1 ratio of SMCC:AP. SMCC was dissolved in acetonitrile at 20 mg/mL and diluted by a factor of 84 when added to AP while vortexing or rapidly stirring. The solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 90 minutes before the unreacted SMCC and low molecular weight reaction products were separated from the AP using gel filtration chromatography (G50 Fine, Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.) in a column equilibrated with column buffer. Antibodies were dialyzed in a minimum of 100 volumes of PBS and diluted to 2 mg/mL in PBS. A solution containing 40 mM N-succinimidyl S-acetylthiopropionate (SATP, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.) was prepared in dimethylsulfoxide, diluted to a final concentration of 0.32 mM in the antibody solution, and incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature. Aminoethanesulfonic acid was added to a final concentration of 20 mM and incubated for 5 minutes to stop the reaction. The modified antibody was dialyzed using a minimum of 100 volumes of 50 mM potassium phosphate, 10 mM borate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, for a minimum of 4 hours before the dialysis buffer was changed and dialysis continued for at least four hours. The antibody concentration was determined using the absorbance at 280 nm with an absorbance of 1.6 corresponding to a 1 mg/mL solution. Hydroxylamine was dissolved to a concentration of 0.5 M in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 7.2. This solution was diluted into the antibody solution to achieve a final concentration of hydroxylamine of 50 mM and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Modified antibody was mixed with SMCC-AP in equimolar amounts and incubated for one hour at room temperature before adding \u03b2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 1 mM, incubating for 5 minutes, adding N-ethylmaleimide to a final concentration of 2 mM and incubating for 5 minutes. Antibody-enzyme conjugates were separated from unconjugated antibody by gel filtration chromatography using SEPHACRYL\u2122 S-200 (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.) in column buffer. Conjugates were diluted into block solution for use in immunoassays., 99043=The above strategy is effected by the use of paired tags and receptors. A tag can any peptide sequence that is common to different members of the library, heterologous to the display package, and fused to a polypeptide displayed from the display package. For example, a tag can be a synthetic peptide sequence, a constant region of an antibody. In some methods, single chain antibodies are displayed in which only the light or heavy chain variable region but not both varies between members. In such situations, among others, the variable region that is the same in different members can be used as a tag. Suitable tag-receptor combinations include epitope and antibody; for example, many high affinity hexapeptide ligands arc known for the anti-dynorphin mAb 32.39, (see Barrett et al., Neuropeptides 6:113\u2013120 (1985) and Cull et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 89:1865\u20131869 (1992)) and a variety of short peptides are known to bind the MAb 3E7 (Schatz, Biotechnology 11:1138\u201343 (1993)). Another combination of tag and antibody is described by Blanar & Rutter, Science 256:1014\u20131018 (1992)., 507139=A plasmid clone was obtained with the VH1\u201318 gene in the same orientation as the other two V genes. This clone, designated pVx6, was then digested with NotI and the purified 26 kb insert coinjected\u2014together with the purified 80 kb NotI insert of pHC2 at a 1:1 molar ratio\u2014into the pronuclei of one-half day (C57BL/6J x DBA/2J)F2 embryos as described by Hogan et al. (. Hogan et al., Manipulating the Mouse Embryo, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, 1994, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview N.Y.)., 507690=Three independent lines of transgenic mice comprising sequences from both Vx6 and HC2 were established from mice that developed from the injected embryos. These lines of transgenic mice are designated (HCo12)14881, (HCo12)15083, and (HCo12)15087. Each of the three lines were then bred with mice comprising the CMD mutation described in Example 23, the JKD mutation (Chen et al. 1993, EMBO J. 12: 811\u2013820), and the (KCo5)9272 transgene (Fishwild et al. 1996, Nature Biotechnology 14: 845\u2013851). The resulting mice express human heavy and kappa light chain transgenes (and produce human sequence heavy and kappa light chain antibodies) in a background homozygous for disruption of the endogenous mouse heavy and kappa light chain loci., 551594=A sequential sandwich enzyme immunoassay was performed using two 8\ufffd8 arrays of monoclonal human anti-interleukin-8 (IL-8) antibodies and human anti-C-reactive protein (CRP) antibodies to analyze samples containing the target antigens. Known concentrations of IL-8 were added to pooled normal heparinized plasma in some samples other samples were generated by adding known concentrations of CRP antigen to a matrix (HSCD) containing 10 mM MOPS pH 7, 650 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 0.1 mM zinc chloride, 2 mM calcium chloride, 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% sodium azide). Five different concentrations of IL-8 and CRP antigens were used to prepare calibrator solutions. IL-8 was added to heparinized plasma for assays using antibodies to IL-8. CRP was added to HSCD for assays using antibodies to CRP. Level 0 was pooled heparinized plasma with unconjugated human anti-IL-8 antibodies at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml to block endogenous IL-8 or HSCD without added antigen; Level 1 contained 20 \u03bcg/ml IL-8 or 0.1 ng/ml CRP; Level 2 contained 100 \u03bcg/ml IL-8 or 1 ng/ml CRP; Level 3 contained 500 \u03bcg/ml IL-8 or 5 ng/ml CRP; Level 4 contained 1 ng/ml IL-8 or 10 ng/ml CRP; and Level 5 contained 5 ng/ml IL-8 or 20 ng/ml CRP. All assays were performed in 384-well black Maxi-Sorb polystyrene microplates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, N.Y.). Human anti-IL-8 antibodies MED002.1.10, MED002.1.25.1.4, MED002.1.25.1.5, MED002.1.25.1.9, MED002.1.25, MED002.1.4, MED002.1.3 and MED002.1.5 and human anti-CRP antibodies CAR007. 1.1, CAR007.1.11, CAR007.1.12, CAR007.1.14, CAR007.1.16, CAR007.1.20, CAR007.1.6, and CAR007.1.18 were used in an 8\ufffd8 array where each antibody was paired with all of the other monoclonals for that target antigen in all possible solid phase/solution phase combinations. Reagent pipetting was performed using a TECAN Genesis RSP 200/8 robotic sample processor (TECAN U.S., Inc., Research Triangle Park, N.C.). Individual microplate wells were washed by a TECAN Columbus 384-well strip washer, and kinetic fluorescence in each microplate well was determined by a TECAN SpectraFluor Plus microplate reader using an excitation wavelength of 430 nm and an emission wavelength of 570 nm. All pipetting methods were programmed using TECAN Gemini 3.0 liquid handling software. All TECAN robotic resources were controlled using the TECAN multischeduler software FACTS 4.5., 248058=The insert and vector were mixed (2:1 molar ratio) together with 1 \u03bcl 10 mM ATP, 1 \u03bcl (1 U/\u03bcl) T4 DNA ligase, 1 \u03bcl 10\ufffd ligase buffer in a final volume of 10 \u03bcl and ligated overnight at 15\ufffd C. The ligation reaction was diluted to 20 \u03bcl, and 1 \u03bcl electroporated into electrocompetent E. coli strain, DH10B (Example 8), plated on LB tetracycline (10 \u03bcg/ml) plates and grown overnight at 37\ufffd C., 28259=The present application is the US national phase of PCT/US00/33042, filed Dec. 6, 2000, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 09/456,090 filed Dec. 6, 1999., 174105=Although the invention has been described in detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. All publications and patent documents cited in this application are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes to the same extent as if each were so individually denoted. A cell lines producing 7F 11 (HB-12443, Dec. 5, 1997) has been deposited at the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. under the Budapest Treaty on the dates indicated and given the accession numbers indicated. The deposits will be maintained at an authorized depository and replaced in the event of mutation, nonviability or destruction for a period of at least five years after the most recent request for release of a sample was received by the depository, for a period of at least thirty years after the date of the deposit, or during the enforceable life of the related patent, whichever period is longest. All restrictions on the availability to the public of these cell lines will be irrevocably removed upon the issuance of a patent from the application., 505739=The HCo12 transgene was generated by coinjection of the 80 kb insert is of pHC2 (Taylor et al., 1994, Int. Immunol., 6: 579\u2013591) and the 25 kb insert of pVx6. The plasmid pVx6 was constructed as described below. An 8.5 kb HindIII/SalI DNA fragment, comprising the germline human VH1-18 (DP-14) gene together with approximately 2.5 kb of 5\u2032 flanking, and 5 kb of 3\u2032 flanking genomic sequence was subcloned into the plasmid vector pSP72 (Promega, Madison, Wis.) to generate the plasmid p343.7.16. A 7 kb BamHI/HindIII DNA fragment, comprising the germline human VH5-51 (DP-73) gene together with approximately 5 kb of 5\u2032 flanking and 1 kb of 3\u2032 flanking genomic sequence, was cloned into the pBR322 based plasmid cloning vector pGP1f (Taylor et al. 1992, Nucleic Acids Res. 20: 6287\u20136295), to generate the plasmid p251f., 85035=Antibody chains can be displayed in single or double chain form. Single chain antibody libraries can comprise the heavy or light chain of an antibody alone or the variable domain thereof. However, more typically, the members of single-chain antibody libraries are formed from a fusion of heavy and light chain variable domains separated by a peptide spacer within a single contiguous protein. See e.g., Ladner, et al., WO 88/06630; McCafferty, et al., WO 92/01047. Double-chain antibodies are formed by noncovalent association of heavy and light chains or binding fragments thereof. Double chain antibodies can also form by association of two single chain antibodies, each single chain antibody comprising a heavy chain variable domain, a linker and a light chain variable domain. In such antibodies, known as diabodies, the heavy chain of one single-chain antibody binds to the light chain of the other and vice versa, thus forming two identical antigen binding sites (see Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 6444\u20136448 (1993) and Carter & Merchan, Curr. Op. Biotech. 8, 449\u2013454 (1997). Thus, phage displaying single chain antibodies can form diabodies by association of two single chain antibodies as a diabody., 65651=The transgenic animals used in the invention bear a heterologous human immune system and typically a knocked out endogenous immune system. Mice are a preferred species of nonhuman animal. Such transgenic mice sometimes referred to as HuMAb mice contain a human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that encodes unrearranged human heavy (\u03bc and \u03b3) and \u03ba light chain immunoglobulin sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous \u03bc and \u03ba chain loci (Lonberg et al. (1994) Nature 368(6474): 856\u2013859 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,429). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or \u03ba, and in response to immunization, the introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgG\u03ba antibodies (Lonberg et al. (1994), supra; reviewed in Lonberg, N. (1994) Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 113:49\u2013101; Lonberg and Huszar, . (1995) Intern. Rev. Immunol.

All assays were performed in 384-well black polystyrene streptavidin-coated microplates (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.) with an average binding capacity of approximately 50 femtomoles biotin/well. Alkaline phosphatase (AP)-labeled antibodies were used to bind antigen captured by antibody on the solid phase, and the binding was detected using AttoPhos substrate (JBL Scientific, San Luis Obispo, Calif.). The antibody sets that were analyzed were polyclonal murine antibody-biotin/polyclonal murine antibody-AP, polyclonal human antibody-biotin/polyclonal human antibody-AP, and monoclonal human antibody M1-10-biotin/monoclonal human antibody M1-25-AP. Both polyclonal human and polyclonal murine antibodies were selected to bind IL-8 using a lower affinity cutoff of 109 M\u22121. Both monoclonal antibodies were selected from the polyclonal human library. The polyclonal mouse antibody library was obtained as described in PCT 98/06704, filed, Apr. 3, 1998 using multiple rounds of selection with biotinylated IL-8 at 1 nM. Reagent pipetting was performed using a TECAN Genesis RSP 200/8 robotic sample processor (TECAN U.S., Inc., Research Triangle Park, N.C.). Individual microplate wells were washed by a TECAN Columbus 384-well strip washer, and kinetic fluorescence in each microplate well was determined by a TECAN SpectraFluor Plus microplate reader using an excitation wavelength of 430 nm and an emission wavelength of 570 nm. All pipetting methods were programmed using TECAN Gemini 3.0 liquid handling software. All TECAN robotic resources were controlled using the TECAN multischeduler software FACTS 4.5., 133209=Nucleic acids encoding antibody chains to be subcloned can be excised by restriction digestion of flanking sequences or can be amplified by PCR using primers to sites flanking the coding sequences. See generally PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification (ed. H. A. Erlich, Freeman Press, NY, N.Y., 1992); PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications (eds. Innis, et al., Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1990); Mattila, et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 19:967 (1991); Eckert, et al., PCR Methods and Applications 1:17 (1991); PCR (eds. McPherson et al., IRL Press, Oxford). PCR primers can contain a marker sequence that allows positive selection of amplified fragments when introduced into an expression vector. PCR primers can also contain restriction sites to allow cloning into an expression vector, although this is not necessary. For Fab libraries, if heavy and light chains are inserted adjacent or proximate to each other in a display vector, the two chains can be amplified or excised together. For some Fab libraries, only the variable domains of antibody chain(s) are excised or amplified. If the heavy or light chains of a Fab library are excised or amplified separately, they can subsequently be inserted into the same or different expression vectors., 144002=The nucleic acid libraries can be expressed to generate polyclonal libraries of antibodies having specific affinity for a target. The composition of such libraries is determined from the composition of the nucleotide libraries. Thus, such libraries typically have at least 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 1000, 104 or 105 members with different amino acid composition. Usually, no single member constitutes more than 25 or 50% of the total polypeptides in the library. The percentage of antibody chains in an antibody chain library having specific affinity for a target is typically lower than the percentage of corresponding nucleic acids encoding the antibody chains. The difference is due to the fact that not all polypeptides fold into a structure appropriate for binding despite having the appropriate primary amino acid sequence to support appropriate folding. In some libraries, at least 25, 50, 75, 90, 95, 99 or 99.9% of antibody chains have specific affinity for the target molecules. Again, in libraries of multi-chain antibodies, each antibody (such as a Fab or intact antibody) is considered a library member. The different antibody chains differ from each other in terms of fine binding specificity and affinity for the target. Some such libraries comprise members binding to different epitopes on the same antigen. Some such libraries comprises at least two members that bind to the same antigen without competing with each other., 80433=A further type of display package comprises a polypeptide bound to a nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. Such an arrangement can be achieved in several ways. U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,731 describe a method in which a plasmid is engineered to expression a fusion protein comprising a DNA binding polypeptide and a polypeptide to be screened. After expression the fusion protein binds to the vector encoding it though the DNA binding polypeptide component. Vectors displaying fusion proteins are screened for binding to a target, and vectors recovered for further rounds of screening or characterization. In another method, polypeptides are screened as components of display package comprising a polypeptide being screened, and mRNA encoding the polypeptide, and a ribosome holding together the mRNA and polypeptide (see Hanes & Pluckthun, PNAS 94, 4937\u20134942 (1997); Hanes et al., PNAS 95, 14130\u201314135 (1998); Hanes et al, FEBS Let. 450, 105\u2013110 (1999); U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,545). mRNA of selected complexes is amplified by reverse transcription and PCR and in vitro transcription, and subject to further screening linked to a ribosome and protein translated from the mRNA. In another method, RNA is fused to a polypeptide encoded by the RNA for screening (Roberts & Szostak, PNAS 94, 12297\u201312302 (1997), Nemoto et al., FEBS Letters 414,405\u2013408 (1997). RNA from complexes surviving screening is amplified by reverse transcription PCR and in vitro transcription., 508456=Two different strains of mice were used to generate hybridomas and monoclonal antibodies reactive to human IL-8. Strain ((CMD)++; (JKD)++; (HCo7)11952+/++; (KCo5)9272+/++), and strain ((CMD)++; (JKD)++; (HCo12)15087+/++; (KCo5)9272+/++). Each of these strains are homozygous for disruptions of the endogenous heavy chain (CMD) and kappa light chain (JKD) loci. Both strains also comprise a human kappa light chain transgene (HCo7), with individual animals either hemizygous or homozygous for insertion #11952. The two strains differ in the human heavy chain transgene used. Mice were hemizygous or homozygous for either the HCo7 or the HCo 12 transgene. The CMD mutation is described above in Example 23, above. The generation of (HCo12)15087 mice is described above. The JKD mutation (Chen et al. 1993, EMBO J. 12: 811\u2013820) and the (KCo5)9272 (Fishwild et al. 1996, Nature Biotechnology 14: 845\u2013851) and (HCo7)11952 mice, are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,429 (Lonberg & Kay, Jun. 23, 1998)., 242180=An additional round of panning was done on the 6th round 10\u221210 M cut antibody phage to increase the number of antibodies with affinity of 1010. The 6th round phage were set up as described above using 975 \u03bcL panning buffer, 25 \u03bcL 6th round antibody phage per sample with the experimental (foreground) tube receiving 10 \u03bcL 10\u22128M interleukin-8-biotin. The blank did not receive any interleukin-8-biotin. After overnight incubation at 2\u20138\ufffd C., the phage samples were panned with avidin magnetic latex and processed as described above. The 7th round antibody phage sample 10\u221210 M cut had a foreground:background ratio 276:1. The antibody phage populations were subcloned into the expression vector and electroporated as described in Example 15., 49749=Targets of interest include antibodies, including anti-idiotypic antibodies and autoantibodies present in autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Other targets of interest are growth factor receptors (e.g., FGFR, PDGFR, EFG, NGFR, and VEGF) and their ligands. Other targets are G-protein receptors and include substance K receptor, the angiotensin receptor, the \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, the serotonin receptors, and PAF receptor. See, e.g., Gilman, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 56:625\u2013649 (1987). Other targets include ion channels (e.g., calcium, sodium, potassium channels), muscarinic receptors, acetylcholine receptors, GABA receptors, glutamate receptors, and dopamine receptors (see Harpold, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,401,629 and US 5,436,128). Other targets are adhesion proteins such as integrins, selecting, and immunoglobulin superfamily members (see Springer, Nature 346:425\u2013433 (1990). Osborn, Cell 62:3 (1990); Hynes, Cell 69:11 (1992)). Other targets are cytokines, such as interleukins IL-1 through IL-13, tumor necrosis factors \u03b1 & \u03b2, interferons \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, tumor growth factor Beta (TGF-\u03b2), colony stimulating factor (CSF) and granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). See Human Cytokines: Handbook for Basic & Clinical Research (Aggrawal et al. eds., Blackwell Scientific, Boston, Mass. 1991). Other targets are hormones, enzymes, and intracellular and intercellular messengers, such as, adenyl cyclase, guanyl cyclase, and phospholipase C. Drugs are also targets of interest. Target molecules can be human, mammalian or bacterial. Other targets are antigens, such as proteins, glycoproteins and carbohydrates from microbial pathogens, both viral and bacterial, and tumors. Still other targets are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,366,241. Some agents screened by the target merely bind to a target. Other agents agonize or antagonize the target., 544658=The cDNA from 5 spleens was amplified by PCR (Example 3, HCo12), and first round antibody phage was prepared as described in Example 7 using BS47 uracil template. Ten electroporations of mutagenesis DNA were done (2 electroporations from each spleen) yielding 10 different phage samples. Phage were set up for the first round of panning by mixing 0.92 mL phage, 30 \u03bcL 300 mg/mL BSA, 2 \u03bcL 1M CaCl2, 50 \u03bcL 1M TRIS, pH 8.0 and 10 \u03bcL 10\u22127M TIC-biotin (Example 30), and incubating overnight at 2\u20138\ufffd C. The antibody phage samples were panned with avidin magnetic latex as described in Example 13. The only difference is the panning buffer also contained 2 mM CaCl2. This panning buffer was used for every panning step described in this example. The resulting 2nd round antibody phage samples were enriched for polyvalent display by panning with 7F11 magnetic latex as described in Example 13. Panning with TIC-biotin was set up for each sample by mixing 900 \u03bcL 7F11/decapeptide enriched phage, 2 \u03bcL 1M CaCl2, 100 \u03bcL panning buffer, and 10 \u03bcL 10\u22127 M TIC-biotin. After overnight incubation at 2\u20138\ufffd C., the phage samples were panned with avidin magnetic latex as described above. The resulting 3rd round antibody phage samples were again enriched for polyvalent display and the eluted phage were set up with TIC-biotin as described above. After overnight incubation at 2\u20138\ufffd C., the phage samples were panned with avidin magnetic latex as described above. Aliquots of each sample were plated on 100 mm LB agar plates to determine the percentage of kappa positives (Example 12). The percentage of kappa positives for the 3rd round of panning was between 91\u201397%. The 4th round antibody phage samples were titered and pooled as described in Example 13. The pooled antibody phage was set up in duplicate for a 4th round of functional panning as described above using 900 \u03bcL panning buffer, 100 \u03bcL 4th round pooled-antibody phage. One sample (foreground) received 10 \u03bcL 10\u22127M TIC-biotin and the other sample (background) did not receive TIC-biotin and served as a blank to monitor non-specific binding of phage to the magnetic latex. After overnight incubation at 2\u20138\ufffd C., the phage samples were panned with avidin magnetic latex as described above. The next day, the 5th round antibody phage was eluted and the number of plaques was counted on the foreground and background plates. The foreground:background ratio was 149:1. The 5th round antibody phage sample was panned with an excess of unbiotinylated troponin IC to generate antibodies specific to troponin complex. Panning was set up essentially as described for the 4th round phage above except 10 \u03bcL 350 \u03bcg/mL unlabelled IC was added in addition to the 10 \u03bcL 10\u22127M TIC-biotin. After overnight incubation at 2\u20138\ufffd C., the phage samples were panned with avidin magnetic latex as described above. The next day, the 5th round antibody phage was eluted and the number of plaques was counted on the foreground and background plates. The foreground:background ratio was approximately 1500:1. The antibody phage population was subcloned into the expression vector and electroporated as described in Example 15, except oligonucleotides 1161 and 1182 were used to amplify the antibody gene insert., 506590=A new cloning vector derived from pGP1f, pGP1k (Seq. ID #1), was digested with EcoRV/BamHI, and ligated to a 10 kb EcoRV/BamHI DNA fragment, comprising the germline human VH3-23 (DP47) gene together with approximately 4 kb of 5\u2032 flanking and 5 kb of 3\u2032 flanking genomic sequence. The resulting plasmid, p112.2RR.7, was digested with BamHI/SalI and ligated with the 7 kb purified BamHI/SalI insert of p251f The resulting plasmid, pVx4, was digested with XhoI and ligated with the 8.5 kb XhoI/SalI insert of p343.7.16., 265319=The ligated DNA (1 \u03bcl) was diluted into 2 \u03bcL of water, then 1 \u03bcL of the diluted DNA was electroporated (Example 8) into 40 \u03bcl of electrocompetent E. coli strain, DH10B. The transformed cells were diluted to 1.0 ml with 2\ufffdYT broth and 10 \u03bcl of 10\u22121, 10\u22122 and 10\u22123 dilutions plated on LB agar plates supplemented with tetracycline at 10 \u03bcg/ml to determine the size of the subcloned polyclonal population. The 109 affinity polyclonal had approximately 6000 different clones, and the 1010 affinity polyclonal had approximately 10,000 different clones. The remaining cells were incubated at 37\ufffd C., 300 rpm for 1 hr, and then the entire culture was transferred into 50 ml 2\ufffdYT supplemented with 1% glycerol and 20 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline and grown overnight at 37\ufffd C. The overnight culture was diluted 1/100 into the same media, grown 8 hr, and glycerol freezer stocks made for long term storage at \u221280\ufffd C.}",
