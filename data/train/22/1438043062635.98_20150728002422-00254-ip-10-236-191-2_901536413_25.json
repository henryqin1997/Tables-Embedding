Only about $2000 a semester., 2426=I have been at Trident since August of 2010 and so far I have nothing bad to say about the teacher and academic advisers who I have had or come into contact with. I have a full 15-hr schedule this semester and although my classes are all quite different and unique, I am learning many new things in them. One of my favorite classes is Western Civ post-1689; which may not sound important but it is because I usually resent history classes about western civilizations. This one however, I quite enjoy.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Trident is a great school for low-income students who wish to transfer to a four-year college after they graduate from Trident. The advisers at Trident are great at helping students select their classes so that they will be able to transfer. Students who are looking for relatively easy classes. Like I said above, Trident's classes are not that challenging at all. As long as you show up for class and pay attention, you should do fairly well. They also have free tutoring for students who are struggling in a class. Tips for prospective students Do NOT get your books until after the start of classes. Some of the teachers do not even use the books that the bookstore tells you that you must have for the class. For my history class last semester, I never used the book at all. My English teacher for this semester told the class straight up that we would not need the books for her class either. If you are getting financial aid, make sure you apply early. The financial aid office has a history of pulling people around in circles and canceling grants at the last moment. Do not wait until the deadline to get things paid for. If you do not pay on time, then you lose your schedule and your classes and you have to re-register and hope that the classes are",
