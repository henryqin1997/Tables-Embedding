It provides a way to expose documents in the Oracle XML DB hierarchy as URIs that can be embedded in any URIType column in a table. The URL part of the URI is the hierarchical name of the XML document it refers to. The optional fragment part uses the XPath syntax, and is separated from the URL part by '#'. The more general XPointer syntax for specifying a fragment is not currently supported. Summary of XDBURITYPE Subtype Subprograms Content type of the document to which URI is pointing.
