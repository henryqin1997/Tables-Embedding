But I wouldn't change my decision to go here., 169488=Today at my residence life staff meetings, I just learned that there is close to $2000 dollars spent PER BUILDING on safety. Each door has card access that only your George Fox ID will allow you in. Even then, only during floor hours are you able to enter other dorms. It is very safe as long as you follow our rules\u00e2??no propping outside doors., 224455=After 2012, the school is less selective, so it's very easy to get into. The science department is very challenging and political, so if you choose to take this classes taking AP in high school will prepare you better than your average courses., 224883=Fox is fine if you want to live in a Christian bubble, but don't expect to be prepared for the real world here. Students are typically very shallow and judgmental if you don't agree with all their beliefs. Fox used to be a great place but in 2012 they adopted a new administration that will - in every sense - make your life miserable., 81458=Check out Bruin Preview! That will give you a good sense of what life is like at the school. Also, try to make it to the scholarship event in February as it will really prepare you for the type of work that the school expects from you--plus you might win a scholarship! (I did!) Visit the school and also a professor from the major(s) that you are interested in pursuing. Attend a chapel session to see if the message resonates with you. Stand in the middle of the quad and see whether you can imagine yourself spending the next four years there., 312148=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

There is a certain atmosphere here, though, that encourages good clean fun (not in a hokey religious way though) rather than the usual college fare of underage drinking and such. Personally, I find it refreshing not to have to worry about inebriated floormates keeping me awake in the wee hours before an exam. All in all, though, Fox is full of fun people, outgoing people, introverted people, studious people, not-so-studious people -- and we all love it and each other. Tips for prospective students Come visit anytime! Bruin Preview is always a good time since there are more things planned for visiting students to do. But anytime is a good time to spend the night and see real life on campus. And when you visit, or if you can't visit, ask questions -- any questions! Just hang out with us. I know when I first visited I was shy and intimidated because I forgot that the",
