            "We have creeper beepers which are little key chain things with buttons on each side. Essentially if you have a medical emergency or feel unsafe, you can press both buttons and it sends a signal to Campus Safety saying where you are. There's also a blue light system where you can press a button and talk to campus safety if you ever need help. I feel very safe there",
            "There's always something going on thanks to the many clubs and activities on campus. Also, really great free food!",
            "The albino squirrel! You have to see him before you graduate. Also, if you don't like the weather outside, do not fear, WE HAVE UNDERGROUND TUNNELS!!! They follow the main path of campus and go to almost all of the buildings and dorms. You never have to step outside if you don't want to, and can wear flip flops in the dead of winter!",
            "Don't let the initial cost of the school scare you. Scholarships and financial aid help a lot! College is going to be the first of many large expenses in your future, but what is different about college as opposed to buying a car or house is that the money you spend here is an investment in yourself. The school is smaller than a state school would be but that is a huge benefit. If a professor sees that you are hardworking, they will do whatever they can to get any opportunities that they feel might be good for you.",
            "The list could go on forever. Mixers (kind of like a dance), sports games, musicals and shows, and an assortment of random events going on every week. We had a really fun dance party like thing that was essentially like a mosh pit in a blow up pool with bubbles. We also had a Hunger Games Training event where there was a showing of the first Hunger Games movie, a large feast, and several events to participate in such as a chicken wing eating contest, archery tag, a blow up maze, etc. There's always something going on.",
            "Plenty of options for whatever you like. Pasta, pizza, subs, wraps, the grill, a healthy eatery. The school also has vegetarian and vegan options. Also if you're especially lazy like me and don't feel like stepping out of your dorm/ academic building, Naz Delivers is a special delivery service that they have to offer. Great for football games when you're craving a pizza and chicken wings!",
            "Love it! Living on campus is amazing because you can wake up twenty minutes before class and walk there. Gas can get expensive and with Western New York weather, you never know when the snow or ice could appear and delay you. It's especially great as a freshman because it makes it easier to meet people. Love my RAs.",
            "It's college so it's definitely not going to be a cake walk. However, your professors set you up for success. If you work hard and show your dedication, you will do great. Some majors are more rigorous than other, but if it's your passion, go for it! Don't forget, you can always change your mind!",
            "Visit!! Take a tour of campus and see for yourself whether or not you would be happy there. My visit to the campus sold me the second I stepped foot there.",
            "Nazareth College has a beautiful campus, and is my home away from home. The faculty is very helpful, and cares about your success. It is a small school, and that allows for you to have a personal connection with all of your professors and fellow students."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Everyone always says you get what you pay for, and I think it definitely applies here. Teachers are fantastic, facilities are continually upgraded, and campus is in a really nice location, so of course you to have to pay up for it. All housing and tuition and books are going to be expensive so as long as you are academically happy it is worth it. Am enjoying being here Although I grew up in a town about 15 minutes away, living on campus has given me a new adoration for the town of Pittsford and the city in general. I have found Pittsford Plaza to be the most convenient shopping center, my friends and I love going to Schoen Place on the canal for ice cream or dinner, and with a car it is not too hard to shoot right down East Ave into the heart of the city. As for the campus itself, I couldn't ask for prettier scenery, and the campus is small enough to enjoy it. Plenty of places to hang out and get coffee, food, study or exercise. Night life on campus leaves something to be desired, if you are looking for a huge party school Nazareth is not the place. But I have never had a problem finding something to do at night and there are",
