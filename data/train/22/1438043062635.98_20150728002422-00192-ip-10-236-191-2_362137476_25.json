    "textAfterTable": "Command Modes Interface configuration Command History Release Modification Release 3.2 This command was introduced. Release 3.4.0 The msec keyword was replaced by the down keyword, and the value of the milliseconds argument was increased to 0 through 65535. The up keyword was added, and the value of the milliseconds argument was set at 0 through 65535. Usage Guidelines When you delay the processing of hardware link down notifications, the higher layer routing protocols are unaware of a link until that link is stable. If the carrier-delay down milliseconds command is configured on a physical link that fails and cannot be recovered, link down detection is increased, and it may take longer for the routing protocols to re-route traffic around the failed link. In the case of very small interface state flaps, running the carrier-delay down milliseconds command prevents the routing protocols from experiencing a route flap.",
