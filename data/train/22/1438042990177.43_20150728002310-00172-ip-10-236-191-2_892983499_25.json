            "There are often robberies on campus. GT police are very present on campus, but simple good habits can prevent robberies etc. Always remember that although GT seems safe, it is in the middle of Atlanta.",
            "Greek life is excellent.",
            "There is a club for everything, and it's easy to start your own.",
            "Studious, involved students will thrive here. You must have a good worth ethic and time management skills.",
            "The T-Book has all traditions and is given to you upon orientation. It is suggested that freshmen read through them and attempt to see/complete all traditions. Freshmen are also given RAT caps (recently acquired tech students) and the marching band still practices mandatory wearing of the caps for freshmen.",
            "The best value for the education you are getting. A GT degree speaks volumes.",
            "GT is close to many concert venues and is right by Centennial Park where the Aquarium and World of Coke are. GT puts on events such as homecoming and I <3 GT week that offer free food and entertainment. The student center screens movies and has events such as midnight breakfast. There's always something going on and the events are always well advertised.",
            "The new North Avenue dining hall is open 24 hours M-Th but closed on weekends. The food there is good, but the menu rarely changes. Woody's on west campus has the best variety of food and rotating menu. Brittain on East campus doesn't have the best food but does cater to many ethnicities (vegetarian, religious holidays, etc)",
            "Freshman dorms on west campus are larger and have better facilities, but are far from the center of campus. East campus is close to greek row, most classes, and the stadium, but date back to the 50's. Peer leaders plan events for freshmen and offer counseling. There is always an RA on duty in case of emergency or lockout.",
            "Classes are tough, there is no such thing as an 'easy' class at Tech. Professors are demanding but often make exceptions for poor scores if you actively seek their help and put in ample effort.",
            "Georgia Tech academics are difficult and you will need to spend much more time studying than you did in high school. Be ready to be humbled, many other students did just as well if not better than you in high school, and will compete with you for top scores. Be willing to put in extra effort for the next four years.",
            "Best post-grad hire rate, many companies hire exclusively from GT. Great campus life rich in tradition. Many buildings on campus are getting upgrades and the new facilities on campus are state of the art."

It looks a lot like soft serve ice cream and students will put sticky note sprinkles on it., 360011=Don't let the classes take you by suprise. You were smart in High School, but so was everyone else at this place. You will discover quickly that your 4.0 in High School and your 2100 on the SAT does not take you very far when you get here. Study hard, study soon, don't procrastinate, and don't get Bellassard for Calc 2., 537011=Engineering students, and nerds who want to make an impact. (2013 Convocation speech: If you want to change the world, you can do that, you're at Georgia Tech. If you want to build the Ironman suit, you can do that, you're at Georgia Tech!), 417581=Freshman cupcake race: at roughly 6:45 in the morning, freshman are HIGHLY encouraged to participate in a semi-short race. Bright side: everyone gets a cupcake at the end, and the two top-finishers get a whole cake!, 720750=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 644424=Stealing the T of tech tower has long been a tradition, but is now considered vandalism and is illegal. Over spring break 2014 the T was stolen, but the student was caught and had to face a judicial hearing. They were going to press charges but the alumni stopped it. It takes a lot of work to steal the T, as it has been wired with sensory detectors, and the climb up to get it is very dangerous., 500451=May not seem like the money is worth it at the time, but Tech has one of the highest return on investment rankings., 48480=Tech has an enormous list of ongoing traditions, and to name them all here would be impossible, but perhaps the week that is surrounded with the most tradition is of course Homecoming week. During this week, many events take place, such as the Mini 500, a tricycle race around Peters Parking Deck, which is led by the Ramblin Wreck, a 1930 Ford Model A Sport Coupe that is one of Tech's mascots. It also leads the football team out at every football game and has been doing so since 1961. Also during Homecoming week is the Freshman Cake race, a mad dash where the prize is an entire cake, as well as a kiss from the Homecoming Queen during the halftime of that week's football game. I'll close this section out with Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate, the name bestowed upon the Tech - uga rivalry. All you need to know right now is TO HELL WITH georgia! (yes, the lowercase georgia is necessary)., 138614=They have programs for Freshman that are always entertaining, and brand new (relatively) West Campus dorms that were built for the 1996 Olympians., 135246=i'd definitely recommend submitting your application by november 1st for those juniors considering applying to gatech. i found out about my admittance by december 16th!!! now i have a lot more time to plan towards next year :d}",

These students are serious towards their studies, but also like to be involved in clubs or sports. Also, students who are looking for a life in the city or near a city will enjoy being near Atlanta. Tips for prospective students 1] Please learn to manage your time. There is time to study, have fun, and just relax. Make sure to not stress yourself out too much! 2] Make sure to be involved in clubs in high school because it helps build teamwork skills needed in college. It is also good to have some leadership positions. Being active in high school tells a college that you are most likely to be an active student in college as well. 3] Study for the SATs and ACTs.",
