Starting at its own 16, Buffalo turned to Spiller as he had carries for five and seven yards before a catch-and-run saw him go 19 yards to get the ball near midfield. Several plays later with the ball at the KC 17, Spiller took a draw play inside the left tackle and went into the end zone for a 7-0 lead with 2:01 left in the first., 77410=After another three-and-out from the Chiefs, Buffalo got the ball back at its own 33. It was Spiller again leading the way as his 38-yard run up the middle set up his 5-yard touchdown run, which saw him take a pitch out to the left and scamper in for his third touchdown of the season and a 14-0 lead with 12:29 to play in the half., 77755=Following an exchange of punts, Cassel fumbled as he was sacked and the Bills recovered at the Chiefs 43. A Spiller 27-yard catch got the ball to the 2-yard line and, following an 8-yard loss, Fitzpatrick hit Scott Chandler in the back of the end zone for a 21-0 lead with 3:29 to play in the half.}",
