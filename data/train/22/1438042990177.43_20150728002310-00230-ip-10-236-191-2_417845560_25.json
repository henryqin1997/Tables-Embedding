Learning to enjoy his job was central to the stunning revival from seemingly washed up domestic batsman to respected Test player.

The fun continued when he quickly became a national fixture with six hundreds in 16 matches, even though he was playing out of position., 91199=Pura Cup Player of the Year - 2007-08, 102345=The Cricket Monthly: Few Sri Lankans have been as widely adored.
