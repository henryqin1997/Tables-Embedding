            "Sonoma State University is a one-of-a-kind, small university surrounded by nature itself. The ratios of students to teachers allows for personal growth with your professors allowing them to get to know you. I recommended this university if you prefer smaller settings in a beautiful area."

Charlie Brown's has okay food and severely overpriced drinks. The University Restaurant, which is sort of a secret more up scale place to eat, has both okay service and okay food. In 2012, though, they started building a new building, which is supposedly going to have more food options, maybe even ones like Subway, or other fast food places, so future students might have more options., 215727=Most traditions are pretty normal here, except there is a Geek Week, which pokes fun at Greek Week. Geek Week happens every Spring semester in March, and is a time for students in math, technology, science and engineering classes to participate in contests and generally conduct activities related to these subjects. All students can participate, not just STEM majors., 242136=Very nice dorms. Some built in 2011. Alot of student mixer type events and Co-op groups.}",

The classes are small (about only 20-30) with some classes as big as 80. I like that the classes are small enough for me to get personal attention from the professers and I won't feel overwhelmed.

You won't get away with missing a class, more often than not they will contact you in some may. My Education professor called me when I missed class due to illness! Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid to talk to your professors, they don't bite! They are always willing to help you",
