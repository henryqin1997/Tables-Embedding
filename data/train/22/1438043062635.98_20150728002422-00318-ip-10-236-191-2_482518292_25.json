    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6258=The ingredients according to Table 6-1 were blended in a Brabender mixer operating at about 50 rpm at a temperature of from 180 to 200\ufffd C. with 1000 ppm Irganox 1076 for 5 to 7 minutes until a smooth mixture was obtained and all ingredients were well dispersed. The blended compound was removed, and a small sample was analyzed for viscosity by measuring the MFR@230\ufffd C. From the remaining portion of the sample, 220 g was compounded with 8 g zinc oxide, 4 g stearic acid, 3 g sulfur, 3 g MBTS, and 3 g TMTMS on a roll mill. This compound was then rolled out into a smooth sheet. This compounded material was then vulcanized at 170\ufffd C. for 30 minutes in the form of a compression molded pad suitable for subsequent analyses. Samples of the appropriate geometry were removed from the vulcanized pad to yield the results shown in Table 6-1 below.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{146076=Comonomer content: The comonomer content and sequence distribution of the polymers can be measured using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Comonomer content of discrete molecular weight ranges can be measured using methods well known to those skilled in the art, including Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) in conjunction with samples by GPC, as described in Wheeler and Willis, Applied Spectroscopy, 1993, vol. 47, pp. 1128-1130., 201821=Polymerization was conducted as follows. In a 27 liter continuous flow stirred tank reactor equipped with a dual pitch blade turbine agitator, 92 Kg of dry hexane, 34 Kg of propylene, 1.8 Kg of ethylene, 1.1 Kg of 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB) were added per hour. The reactor was agitated at 650 rpm during the course of the reaction and was maintained liquid full at 1600 psi pressure (gauge) so that all regions in the polymerization zone had the same composition during the entire course of the polymerization. A catalyst solution in toluene of 1.5610-3 grams of dimethylsilylindenyl dimethyl hafnium and 2.4210-3 grams of dimethylanilinium tetrakis (heptafluoronaphthyl) borate was added at a rate of 6.35 ml/min to initiate the polymerization. An additional solution of tri-n-octyl aluminum (TNOA) was added to remove extraneous moisture during the polymerization. The polymerization was conducted at 59\ufffd C. and the temperature was maintained during the polymerization by adding pre-chilled hexane at a temperature between \u22123\ufffd C. and 2\ufffd C. The polymerization was efficient and led to the formation of 9.5 Kg of polymer per hour. The polymer was recovered by two stage removal of the solvent, first by removing 70% of the solvent using a lower critical solution process as described in WO0234795A1, and then removing the remaining solvent in a LIST devolatization extruder. The polymer was recovered as pellets about a \u215b to {fraction (1/4)} inch in principal axes. The polymer was analyzed to contain 12.4 wt % ethylene, 2.34 wt % of incorporated ENB, and had a ML (1+4) @ 125\ufffd C. of 22., 106491=In yet another particular embodiment, the propylene-based elastomer is produced using any of the catalyst systems and polymerization methods disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2004/0024146, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 164428=Shore A and Shore D hardness The determination of the Shore A and Shore D hardness of the polymer is according to ASTM D 2240. In this version of the method a portion of the sample is tested at room temperature. The data is recorded 15 seconds after the indentation is created in the sample., 163722=Melt flow rate and melt index The determination of the Melt Flow rate (MFR) and the Melt Index of the polymer is according to ASTM D1238 using modification 1 with a load of 2.16 kg. In this version of the method a portion of the sample extruded during the test was collected and weighed. The sample analysis is conducted at 230\ufffd C. with a 1 minute preheat on the sample to provide a steady temperature for the duration of the experiment. This data expressed as dg of sample extruded per minute is indicated as MFR. In an alternative procedure, the test is conducted in an identical fashion except at a temperature of 190 C. This data is referred to as MI@190 C., 90292=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/519,975, filed Nov. 14, 2003, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 149925=Tacticity Index: The tacticity index, expressed herein as \u201cm/r\u201d, is determined by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The tacticity index m/r is calculated as defined in H. N. Cheng, Macromolecules, 17, 1950 (1984). An m/r ratio of 1.0 generally describes a syndiotactic polymer, and an m/r ratio of 2.0 generally describes an atactic material. An isotactic material theoretically may have a ratio approaching infinity, and many by-product atactic polymers have sufficient isotactic content to result in ratios of greater than 50., 103307=Illustrative non-limiting examples of suitable propylene-based elastomers, as well as the methods for preparing them, include the \u201cFPC\u201d disclosed in pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/519,975; the \u201cisotactic propylene copolymer\u201d disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0204017; the \u201cpropylene ethylene copolymers\u201d disclosed in U.S. Pat.

A thin homogeneous film is pressed at a temperature of about 150\ufffd C. or greater, and mounted on a Perkin Elmer PE 1760 infrared spectrophotometer. A full spectrum of the sample from 600 cm\u22121 to 4000 cm\u22121 is recorded and the monomer weight percent of ethylene can be calculated according to the following equation: Ethylene wt %=82.585\u2212111.987X+30.045X2, where X is the ratio of the peak height at 1155 cm\u22121 and peak height at either 722 cm\u22121 or 732 cm\u22121, whichever is higher., 91245=Amorphous and partially crystalline (generally referred to as semi-crystalline) polymers can provide elastomeric properties as defined, for example, in ASTM D1566. An important class of elastomers is derived from polyolefins, generally using addition polymerization with a Ziegler-Natta type catalyst system. Currently, polyolefin elastomers are interpolymers of ethylene, a crystallinity-disrupting \u03b1-olefin such as propylene, which provides short chain branches, and optionally small amounts of a polyene, such as a diene, to provide unsaturated short chain branches useful in providing crosslinks between different chains. These interpolymers may be ethylene propylene copolymers (EP) not containing units derived from diene, or ethylene propylene diene terpolymers (EPDM)., 166233=V2504, V3666, V404, ESC 4292, Achieve 3854, and EMPR 103 are polyolefins available from ExxonMobil Chemical Co, Houston, Tex., 104510=In a particular embodiment, the catalyst system used to produce the propylene-based elastomer includes one or more transition metal compounds and one or more activators. When alumoxane or aluminum alkyl activators are used, the combined pre-catalyst-to-activator molar ratio is generally from 1:5000 to 10:1. When ionizing activators are used, the combined pre-catalyst-to-activator molar ratio is generally from 10:1 to 1:10. Multiple activators may be used, including using mixtures of alumoxanes or aluminum alkyls with ionizing activators., 166403=Irganox 1076 is an antioxidant available from Novartis Corporation., 106807=In yet another particular embodiment, the propylene-based elastomer is produced using a catalyst system such as one of the nonmetallocene, metal-centered, heteroaryl ligand catalyst systems described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2003/0204017, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.}",
