If you include a power control policy in a service profile that is associated with a rack-mount server, the policy is not implemented. No Power Capping Support for Rack-Mount Servers You can configure up to 56 vNICs per supported adapter, such as the Cisco UCS P81E Virtual Interface Card (N2XX-ACPCI01), on any rack-mount server that is integrated with Cisco UCS Manager. Limit to the Number of vNICs that Can Be Configured on a Rack-Mount Server In addition to any guidelines or recommendations that are specific to policies and pools included in service profiles and service profile templates, such as the local disk configuration policy, you need to be aware of the following guidelines and recommendations that impact the ability to associate a service profile with a server: Guidelines and Recommendations for Service Profiles Service profiles created from an updating template inherit all the properties of the template and remain connected to the template. Any changes to the template automatically update the service profiles created from the template. Updating template Service profiles created from an initial template inherit all the properties of the template. However, after",
