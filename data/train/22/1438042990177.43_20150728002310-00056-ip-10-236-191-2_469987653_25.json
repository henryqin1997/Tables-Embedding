    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{22802=Thermal decomposition of natural gas has been used for decades for the production of carbon black with hydrogen being a supplementary fuel for the process (Thermal Black Process). Such a process has been practiced in a semi-continuous fashion using two tandem reactors at high operational temperatures (about 1400\ufffd C.). Attempts have been made to reduce the maximum temperature of the decomposition of methane via the use of catalysts. Data on the catalytic decomposition of methane using Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, Pt, Pd, and Rh-based catalysts have been reported in the literature, such as by M. A. Ernaakova et al., Journal of Catalysis, Volume 201, page 183, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference. Among all the catalysts investigated, nickel appears to provide the highest activity and is most commonly used for this purpose., 23665=A two-step process, in which the catalytic decomposition of methane was firstly carried out followed by regeneration of the deactivated catalyst with O2, CO2 or H2O, has been suggested for the generation of hydrogen by Choudhary et al., Journal of Catalysis, Volume 192, page 316, 2000. In this approach, the deposited carbon, a valuable by-product, was burned off as CO and/or CO2. Consequently, such a method does not offer any significant advantages over that of conventional steam reforming, because of the large emissions of carbon oxides. Furthermore, the catalyst needs to be reduced again prior to the next cycle and its use is limited due to the irreversible transformation of metallic particles that occurs during regeneration and reaction steps., 46153=In this series of experiments the effect of the composition of the NiMgO catalyst on the yields of hydrogen and solid carbon products obtained from the decomposition of methane was investigated. All the NixMgyO catalyst powders were initially calcined at 500\ufffd C. in air and reduced at 850\ufffd C. in 10% H2/Ar prior to reaction with methane (60 ml/min) at 550\ufffd C. Each reaction was carried out up to the point at which complete deactivation of the catalyst occurred. From the data presented in Table 1 it is evident that the highest yields of hydrogen and the solid carbon product were obtained from a catalyst powder having a Ni to Mg molar ratio of 2.4:1, i.e. 78% Ni.}",
