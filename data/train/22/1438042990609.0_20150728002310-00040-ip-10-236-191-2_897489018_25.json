Cost per credit for 2012 will be somewhere around $55 per credit for undergraduates and $137 per credit for graduate students. For foreign or non-resident undergraduate students, the yearly rate is around $4,369.00 (sans the $800 yearly special fee and this is if you take the 12 credits minimum per semester to be considered a full-time student). For foreign or non-resident graduate students, the yearly fee is something like $6,371.00 (again without counting the $800 fee and as a full-time student taking a minimum of 8 credits per semester).}",

The academic offerings are vast and the university is located at the heart of Rio Piedras, which is basically kept alive by the university community. Tips for prospective students Be aware that you have to have a working knowledge of Spanish as almost all courses are given in that language (except English and foreign languages majors, of course). There's a decent population, however, of foreign students who study in the Natural Sciences faculty and I've noticed many of them don't know much Spanish. Still, if you want to get to know the locals, knowing Spanish definitely helps (although many Puerto Ricans in the metropolitan area DO know English). Bang for the buck",
