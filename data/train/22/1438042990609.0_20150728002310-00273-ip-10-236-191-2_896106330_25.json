    "textAfterTable": "Will learn a lot I was truly impressed by innovative facilities and how my questions were answered in a friendly manner. I was impressed by their well-presented computer-engineering workshop. The teachers explained everything on what to do and what not. They also helped you if you need any. But that was a computer engineering teacher so i don't know if every teachers are like that for every major.

NYIT is very culturally diverse and students are exposed to different cultures, religions, and belief systems that will expand their own knowledge of who they are. NYIT is also for the hard workers as passion is a requirement for each major. Students are expected to give their all in everything they do.",
