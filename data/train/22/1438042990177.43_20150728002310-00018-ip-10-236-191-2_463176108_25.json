No. 09/680,063, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Developing Software,\u201d filed on Oct. 4, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,851,107, which claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/157,826, entitled \u201cVisual Unified Modeling Language Development Tool,\u201d filed on Oct. 5, 1999, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/199,046, entitled \u201cSoftware Development Tool,\u201d filed on Apr. 21, 2000; all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 243785=The Database Management System (DBMS) Server 2008 may be any known DBMS, such as Oracle 7.3x/8x DBMS, ODBC/Access 97, Cloudscape, ODBC/MS SQL Server, or IBM DB2 6.1. The DBMS Server 2008 manages a known relational database 2020 that contains the business data structures of the organization that an EJB EntityBean represents (e.g., customers, bank accounts, or hotel rooms) or that an EJB SessionBean may access to complete a transaction (e.g., BankTeller SessionBean may perform Processloan( ) method or HotelClerk SessionBean may perform Reserveroom( ) method). Thus, the Client Application 2004 can invoke business methods remotely to access desired business logic data in the database 2020 or perform a desired task that uses business logic data in the database 2020 via EJB 2002. Enterprise JavaBeans\u2122 are more clearly described in the following references, which are incorporated herein by reference:, 282206=The software development tool then determines whether to hot deploy the EJB (step 3808). The software development tool may hot deploy EJB 3902 by starting the EJB target application server 4002 on the computer 2104 before deploying EJB 3902. By hot deploying EJB 3902, the software development tool saves development time as the programmer no longer has to manually start the EJB target application server 4002 to test or debug the EJB 3902. In addition, by hot deploying the software development tool is able to re-deploy the EJB without having re-start the EJB target application server 4002, saving the programmer significant time and effort. The manual effort to start the EJB target application server 4002 on computer 2104 is significant where computer 2104 is remotely located. As discussed below, the software development tool is able to \u201ccold deploy\u201d to facilitate testing of the EJB. In this situation, the software development tool deploys the EJB to the EJB target application server and then starts restarts the EJB target application server so that the EJB target application server will recognize and support the deployed EJB. Each time the software development tool \u201ccold deploys\u201d the EJB (e.g., re-deploys the EJB after a modification of the EJB is made and the EJB is recompiled), the software development tool restarts the EJB target application server., 55825=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/680,030, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Generating, Applying, And Defining A Pattern,\u201d filed on Oct. 4, 2000;, 253873=If the requested type of EJB is an EJB SessionBean, the software development tool generates an EJB SessionBean Implementation Class (graphically depicted as 2430), a corresponding EJB Home Interface (graphically depicted as 2432), and a corresponding EJB Remote Interface (2434) by parsing one of a group of associated templates in the same manner as described for the EJB EntityBean Implementation Class 2402 above. The software development tool also adds signatures for life cycle methods contained in the EJB SessionBean Implementation Class 2430 to the code corresponding to the EJB Home Interface 2432, such as a signature for create method. The software development tool also adds signatures for business methods contained in the EJB SessionBean Implementation Class 2430 to the code corresponding to the EJB Remote Interface 2434., 308630=In another implementation, if the software development tool identifies that the ejbCreate( ) method has a parameter, the software development tool provides in the respective JSP file that the hyperlink for each ejbCreate( ) method in the JSP Navigation Page launch a JSP Creator Run Page. The JSP Creator Run Page is a second of the JSP files generated by the software development tool. The JSP Creator Run Page provides the programmer with the capability to provide an initial value for the parameter before the respective ejbCreate( ) method is invoked and run. To generate the JSP Creator Run Page, the software development tool parses a Creator Page template (not shown) that is a second of the group of JSP templates. The Creator Page template indicates to the software development tool to provide an entry box on the JSP Creator Page for accepting an initial value for the parameter, and to provide another hyperlink to invoke and run the respective ejbCreate( ) method with the parameter set to the initial value. In one implementation in which the Client Application 2152 is hosted with the software development tool on the local computer 2102, the software development tool may verify that an instance of the respective EJB was created and that the field of the respective EJB was initialized to the parameter by accessing and displaying the attribute field in the database (i.e., 2158)., 56004=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/680,064, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Collapsing A Graphical Representation Of Related Elements,\u201d filed on Oct. 4, 2000;, 262197=When either the EJB EntityBean 2402 or the EJB SessionBean 2430 is selected, the list of code element types includes a business method type (e.g., 2508 or 2604), an EJB Environment Reference type (e.g., 2514 or 2606), an EJB Reference type (e.g., 2516 or 2608), an EJB Security Role Reference type (e.g., 2518 or 2610), or an EJB Resource Reference type (e.g., 2520 or 2612), which are described below. In addition, when the EJB EntityBean 2402 is selected, the list of code element types also includes a create method type 2504, a find method type 2506, a persistent field type 2510 that is to be mapped to a database table corresponding to the EJB EntityBean 2402, and another primary key field type 2512 that is to be used in combination with the primary key field (e.g., 2416) already in the code of the EJB Entity Bean to uniquely identify the EJB Entity Bean to a database table. For example, assuming that the EJB EntityBean represents a senior citizen, the name of the citizen and the age of the citizen may be two primary fields needed in combination to identify the EJB EntityBean to a corresponding table in the database., 247467=Memory 2114 in computer 2104 includes an EJB Application Server 2148 that generates the EJB container 2150 in memory 2114 when started by the software development tool or when manually started by a developer. Memory 2116 in computer 2106 includes a Client Application 2152 and a browser 2154 that are used to test an EJB deployed by the software development tool. Memory 2118 in computer 2108 includes a Database Management System 2156. Secondary storage device 2126 includes a database 2158 that is managed by the Database Management System Server 2156. Database 2158 stores business logic data that is accessible by an EJB deployed by the software development tool. As known to one skilled in the art, EJB Application Server 2148, Client Application 2152, and Database Management System Server 2156 may be hosted locally with the software development tool on memory 2112 in computer 2102 so that the software development tool may deploy and test an EJB from the same computer. When the software development tool deploys and tests an EJB, the data processing system 2100 may function as described above for a three-tiered client/server system 2000., 287984=Having received the access information for the EJB target application server 4002, the software development tool starts target application server (step 3814). To start the EJB target application server 4002, the software development tool sends a start command created from a known application program interface (API) for the EJB target application server 4002. In another implementation, the software development tool sends a pre-defined batch file that contains instructions recognizable by the EJB target application server 4002 for starting the EJB target application server 4002. The pre-defined batch file (not shown in figures) may be stored in secondary storage device 2120., 339091=In another implementation where browser 2154 resides on remote computer 2106, the software development tool may inform the browser 2154 of the network address 4906 for browsing the JSP files by sending a pre-defined message containing the network address 4906 to a pre-defined e-mail address on remote computer 2106. Adhering to standard e-mail protocols, another programmer or a customer using the remote computer 2106 may then be informed of the network address 4906 in response to the pre-defined message being delivered to the pre-defined e-mail address on remote computer 2106. Thus, the other programmer or the customer is then able to manually enter the network address 4906 into the browser 2154 in order to remotely test EJB 3902 or click on the address in typical e-mail clients to automatically invoke the JSP page., 241709=The EJB Application Server 2006 may be any known application server, such as BEA Weblogic Server or IBM Websphere Server that complies with Sun's Java\u2122 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) specification which ensures a consistent platform for deploying an EJB by requiring that a specific set of communication protocols and standard services be provided by the EJB Application Server 2006. The EJB Application Server 2006 includes an EJB container 2018 that hosts and manages the deployed EJB 2002. The EJB container 2018 implements the home interface 2014 and the remote interface 2016 that contain the method signatures of the EJB 2002. The EJB container 2018 isolates the EJB 2002 from direct access by the Client Application 2004. When the Client Application 2004 invokes a life cycle method (i.e., a create method) or a business method on the EJB 2002, home interface 2014 or remote interface 2016, respectively, communicates the invocation to the EJB container 2018 through known protocols on network 2010. When the Client Application 2004 invokes a create method (i.e., a life cycle method), the EJB container 2018 intercepts the invocation and instantiates the EJB 2002 to form a distributed object of the EJB 2002 that is responsive to business method invocations via remote interface 2016. When the Client Application 2004 invokes a business method, the EJB container 2018 intercepts the invocation before passing it to the object of the EJB 2002 to ensure persistence, transactions, and security are applied properly to every operation the Client Application performs on the object of the EJB 2002. The EJB container 2018 manages security, transactions, and persistence automatically for EJB 2002, so a developer doesn't have to use the software development tool to write this type of logic into the code corresponding to EJB 2002., 252813=In addition, if the requested type of EJB is an EJB EntityBean, the software development tool also generates an EJB Home Interface (graphically depicted as 2418) and an EJB Remote Interface (graphically depicted as 2420) for the EJB EntityBean Implementation Class 2402. To generate the EJB Home Interface and the EJB Remote Interface, the software development tool parses a Home Interface template to add Home Interface code to another source code file, and parses a Remote Interface template to add Remote Interface code to another source code file. The software development tool also adds signatures for life cycle methods contained in the EJB EntityBean Implementation Class 2402 to the code corresponding to the EJB Home Interface 2418, such as signatures for create or find methods. The software development tool also adds signatures for business methods contained in the EJB EntityBean Implementation Class 2402 to the code corresponding to the EJB Remote Interface 2420., 336102=In another implementation where the server host identification 4808 indicates that the EJB Application Server 2148 is hosted locally with the software development tool, the software development tool may indicate to the EJB Application Server 2148 where the deployment archive is located on the local computer without using a system password 4804. In this implementation, the EJB Application Server 2148 may then access the deployment descriptor file 5100 contained within the deployment archive., 251920=If the requested type of EJB is an EJB EntityBean, the software development tool also generates an EJB EntityBean Primary Key class (graphically depicted as 2408) by parsing an EntityBean Primary Key Class template to add EJB Primary Key code to another EJB source code file. The EJB Primary Key code contains method constructs, such as \u201cEntity1PK( ),\u201d \u201cequal( )\u201d and \u201chashcode( )\u201d (graphically depicted as 2410, 2414, and 2412, respectively) to identify the EJB EntityBean with a pointer to a table in the database 2158. The software development tool also adds a Primary Key attribute, \u201cfield1\u201d (graphically depicted as 2416), to both the EJB EntityBean Implementation class 2602 and the EJB EntityBean Primary Key class 2408 to be used as a primary key index into the table in the database 2158.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While various embodiments of the present invention have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible that are within the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be restricted except in light of the attached claims and their equivalents. . As one skilled in the art will appreciate, the software development tool is able to store, retrieve, and send a start command that is recognizable by the EJB Target Application Server specified by the programmer. Thus, in this situation, the programmer is able to test code for a client application against one or more deployed EJBs without running the EJB Target Application Server in debug mode. The EJBs may have previously been developed and tested by the programmer using the software development tool or may have been provided by a known vendor so additional debugging of the EJBs may not be required. FIG. 43 If the EJB is not to run in debug mode, the software development tool initiates execution of the EJB in normal mode (step 3880). The software development tool may initiate execution of the EJB in normal mode by sending a start command to the EJB Target Application Server at a pre-defined network address, such as network address 4302 in , the line of source code 6110 corresponds to a business method",
