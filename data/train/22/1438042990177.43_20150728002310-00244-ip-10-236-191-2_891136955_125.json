            "I feel very safe on campus. UNC has an alert system to let students and parents know, via their phone and email, when extreme situations occur on campus. Campus security is visible and accessible, as are Emergency poles. I have never felt threatened or insecure on campus.",
            "The clubs and activities at UNC are top notch. There really is something for everyone, from Ultimate Frisbee to Swing Dancing, to Nerf wars, if you can dream it, you can join it. And if your club doesn't exist, you're always welcome to start one!",
            "I'd recommend UNC to a student who is out going, curious, and ambitious. UNC is set up to cater to these types of students, and if this fits you, you will thrive at UNC.",
            "One of my favorite finds on campus is Graham Memorial. It's an old building that seems to be out of a movie. There are really comfortable couches, fireplaces, old paintings, and dim lighting. A perfect place to study in the winter.",
            "UNC is quite expensive for a state school, but well worth the money. The atmosphere is pleasant, the classes are enlightening, and the staff is helpful.",
            "I really love just walking around on campus. I can't walk anywhere without seeing someone I know, and it's nice to be able to just sit down and chat. Franklin Street is always a fun place to go for shopping, food, or entertainment, and it's only ever a 30 minute walk away.",
            "The food at UNC is typical dining hall food. That being said, UNC does make an effort to provide options to students. There are two main dining locations that meal plans work at, each with 3 or 4 main meal options, in addition to a salad bar, sandwich bar, and pizza. It may not always be what you want, but it is possible to eat a healthy meal.",
            "I LOVE living in the UNC dorms. I was able to make so many friends living in my residence community, and feel comfortable and safe there. When I come 'home' from classes, I feel truly relaxed and comfortable in my dorm. It is a safe and fun place.",
            "UNC is known for its challenging classes. In order to succeed, you have to work hard and be willing to ask for help. The university provides many resources to ensure your success, you just have to use them often!",
            "Get involved!! Find a club or group that you're interested in, and be willing to try new things. Joining a club allows you to make friends with people you may not have ordinarily met, and is a great way to relax after a long day of classes.",
            "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has an incredibly diverse group of students. That's probably the number one thing I love about being there -- every day, I meet people who come from different places and backgrounds than myself. I learn just as much from my fellow students as I do from my classes~"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29271=You do a lot of studying for the test, meaning you cram as much information as possible into your head for exams and to get homework done, but it's so much information in a short period of time that you don't remember much of it in the long run. I personally don't feel like I will graduate a well-rounded person with knowledge of many subjects, because the constant onslaught of new info makes it impossible to remember any past info. Plus you don't get a whole ton of real-world experience unless you're wanting to go into science or a research-heavy field (e.g. history). My biggest issue is that the there are so many gen ed credits you have to take. I know all colleges have them, but UNC's are ridiculous (2 Englishes, 2 Maths, 2 Sciences plus 1 Lab, up to level 4 in Foreign Language, 1 Lifetime Fitness 1 Experiential Education, 1 US Diversity, 3 Social Sciences, 1 Literary Arts, 1 Visual and Performing Arts, 1 Philosophical and Moral Reasoning, 1 Word Before 1790, 1 Beyond the North Atlantic, 1 Global Issues) so if you have no interest whatsoever in a class it makes it difficult to stay motivated. By the time you get to college, you know what your general strengths and weaknesses are, so (for example) having to take 2 sciences when you know you struggle with science is miserable. Moreover, some labs like chemistry or biology are about 4 hours long but you only receive one credit hour for it and have a separate exam for it - how does that make sense? This is especially frustrating in light of the fact that you're being forced to spend all that time in lab if you may not want to take it in the first place. However, if you want to learn skills like how to succeed in an interview or to build a resume, their career services is VERY helpful and work with you a lot. All these things considered, I am still only a freshman and so can't really know if you start learning more/learning more practical skills when you start taking upper-level courses. Also, the teachers tend to be very caring and want to help you as much as they can, even if it's a huge lecture class and their only exposure to you is through office hours. Many classes are taught by TAs though, and I've only heard of maybe 2 or 3 good TAs - most people hate theirs and say they are awful teachers., 164681=We protect the old well from NC state students trying to mess with it before football games. Everyone rushes Franklin on Halloween, and at the beginning of the year when the clubs are being advertised. LDOC-Last day of classes means there will be so many parties. Also we rave in Davis Library in huge numbers on Dec 9th., 13579=Set in a small town not far from just about everything, there isn't much not to love about UNC. If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of classes and academic life, just relax on the beautiful and historic campus of the nation's oldest public institution, head to Franklin street for the typical college town experience, or catch a free bus ride to nearby Carrboro and relax in the Bohemian city center. There's also never a shortage of things to do on campus, as students can watch the 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball champions for free in the Dean Dome, meet like-minded people in student organizations, or watch a movie in the student union., 816178=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2663=The great academics are one major plus, but the social scene makes this the ideal college environment! Located in a safe community, this University has everything an undergraduate could ask for. Local places to eat, entertaining attractions, and a world renowned area (Franklin st.) that is home to some of the university's biggest celebrations (i.e: the celebrations of the 2009 NCAA Basketball championship & the 2008 presidential election). It is also a short distance from Durham, home of the famous Minor League Durham Bulls and Raleigh, the states capital! No matter the day of the week, the University of North Carolina is very enjoyable for its students!, 170715=Students who love sex. UNC was rated #1 for the best sex life for Playboy in 2012., 201348=The University of North Carolina is required by state law to admit North Carolina residents as 82% of their prospective feshman class (a fact you wont find on their admissions website). They only accepted 800 out-of-state students in their freshman class of 2013 (from over 20,000 out-of-state applicants). So, unless you're a North Carolina resident, getting in to this school is more competitive than most Ivy League schools!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I have enjoyed every minute of it. I was intimidated by the size of the school at first, but I found quickly that in such a diverse campus, you can always find someone just like you and someone completely unlike you that you still get along with just as well! Being in the UNC Marching Tar Heels, I've made some awesome friends already, and involvement in this organization has helped me get in touch with my 'school spirit' side - football and basketball games, Fallfest, parades...it makes the experience so much more personal, and lays testament to the fact that Tarheels are all a big family, and always will be. Am learning a lot I have personally learned a great deal in all of my classes taken thus far. Difficult courses like Chemistry 101 and Latin (the hardest in the Classics dept.) have not been a walk in the park, but I've found that I tend to come out of those classes knowing more because they required more out of me! Yet all the courses I have taken have been enriching in their own way, and I have not had a single bad professor yet; everyone is different and gets along differently with others, but I feel that each of the staff at UNC Chapel Hill is easy to get",
