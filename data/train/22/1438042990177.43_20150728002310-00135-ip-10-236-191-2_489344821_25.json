    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6191=An example of such a situation is shown in FIG. 19. Emitter 1 in FIG. 19 has a dwell duration of 1 ms and a revisit time of 500 ms. Emitter 2 has a dwell duration of 2 ms and a revisit time of 1200 ms. Suppose that when extracting a scan strategy for these two emitters (e.g., using the method described above in connection with dwell placement), a dwell is created that covers both Emitter 1 and Emitter 2 of FIG. 19. Using the method of computing cost as described in Table 3, the cost of this dwell would be}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{112953=If the conflict cannot be avoided, the conflict may be recorded for the operator, since it might be possible to alter the emitter representation. If the operator cannot alter the representation, then the dwell solution will be redundant in the overlap range, with at least one dwell each tailored to solve the conflict. Building on the previous example, assume emitter #2 was identical to emitter #1 1500\u20132000, but POP is still off, and there is no emitter #3. Then two 1500\u20132500 MHz dwells are created, one with POP on and one with POP off, and an error is logged. A 3rd dwell is still needed to cover emitter #1., 150052=Thus, for example, when executing a dwell having a frequency range of 1100 MHz\u20131200 MHz, a dwell duration of 10 milliseconds (ms), and a revisit time of 125 ms, the receiver will spend 10 ms tuned between 1100 MHz and 1200 MHz. Revisit time is measured from the beginning of the first execution of the dwell to the beginning of the next execution of the dwell. After the dwell has completed execution (i.e., after the 10 ms dwell duration has expired), 115 ms will elapse before the dwell is executed again. An additional dwell parameter is the detecting method. The detecting method of a dwell is the IF and VBW filter bandwidth combination. Each detecting method has an associated sensitivity. The detecting method affects the frequency range of a dwell, as the dwell's maximum frequency range is limited by the bandwidth of the receiver's IF filter. The revisit time of the dwell is also dependent on the detecting method as a more sensitive detecting method will yield a higher probability of detection. Thus, the more sensitive (i.e., smaller bandwidth) detecting method used, the greater the revisit time will be., 111317=Emitter #1 Frequency range: 1500\u20132000 MHz, POP On (normal case). Emitter #2 Frequency range: 2050\u20132550 MHz. POP Off (for some receivers, this is required for AM pulses, since the assumption of \u201csquare\u201d pulses is not true, and may cause multiple encoding if POP is left enabled)., 178431=Solution 2 covers the same portion of the frequency spectrum using the more sensitive detecting method, Detecting Method 2. In this case, nine Detecting Method 2 dwells are needed to cover the same portion of the frequency spectrum as one Detecting Method 1 dwell. In Solution 2, Dwells 1\u20137 cover only Emitter E3, as Emitter E4 does not operate in the portion of the frequency spectrum covered by Dwells 1\u20137 (i.e., 1510 MHz\u20131720 MHz). Thus, the cost of each of Dwells 1\u20137 is computed using a DDMAX of 2 ms and an RVTMIN of 330 ms (i.e., the minimum dwell duration and revisit time of Emitter E3). However, Dwells 8 and 9 cover portions of the frequency spectrum that may be used by both Emitters E3 and E4. Thus, the cost of each of Dwells 8 and 9 is computed using a DDMAX of 4 ms (i.e., the dwell duration of Emitter E4) and an RVTMIN of 330 ms (i.e., the revisit time of Emitter E3). As shown in Table 6, the total cost of these nine dwells is approximately 0.06. In this case, a single lower sensitivity dwell (i.e., Solution 1) yields a lower cost than multiple higher sensitivity dwells (i.e., Solution 2)., 31049=This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119(e) to commonly-owned U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/427,103, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SCAN TABLE ANALYSIS AND GENERATION, filed on Nov. 18, 2002 under which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety., 172598=Solution 2 illustrates the cost of covering the same frequency range with a higher sensitivity detecting method. In Solution 2, Detecting Method 2 (i.e., 30 MHz IF/15 MHz VBW) is used to cover the portion of the frequency spectrum ranging from 1000 MHz to 1270 MHz. Because of the smaller bandwidth of this detecting method, more dwells are needed to cover the same portion of the frequency spectrum. However, because the revisit time associated with the more sensitive detecting method is greater than that of the less sensitive detecting method, the cost per dwell is reduced. In Solution 2, Dwells 1\u20137 cover only Emitter E1 because Emitter E2 does not operate in the frequency range covered by Dwells 1\u20137. Thus, Dwells 1\u20137 have a DDMAX of 3 ms and a RVTMIN of 650 ms. As a result, the cost of each of Dwells 1\u20137 is 3/650. However, Dwells 8 and 9 cover both Emitter E1 and Emitter E2, thus the DDMAX of these dwells is 5 (i.e., the MDT of Emitter E2) and the RVTMIN is 650 ms (i.e., the RVT of Emitter E1). Thus, the cost of each of Dwells 8 and 9 is 5/650. As shown in Table 5, the total cost is 31/650 or approximately 0.048., 111642=Assume a detecting bandwidth of 1000 MHz and 250 MHz. Any solution that attempts to include the emitters in the same dwell will cause a conflict to be detected. Such solutions are not favored by the dwell placement methods described below, which should find at least two 1000 MHz dwells at bandwidths 1000\u20132000 and 2050\u20133050. These two dwells avoid the conflict. If there is no gap between the dwells, or if additional conflict exists, then the 1000 MHz dwell may not be allowed., 266603=Once the scan strategy is created, a post-processing check may be performed to ensure that no coverage gaps have been introduced between adjacent dwells, as a result of rounding down the minimum frequency between dwells. When the scan strategy is created, if the minimum frequency of a dwell is not an integer multiple of the tuning step of the receiver, then the frequency range of the dwell will be shifted down so that the minimum frequency of the dwell is an integer multiple of the tuning step size. For example suppose the tuning step of the receiver is 10 MHz and a dwell is created having a frequency range of 1255 MHz\u20131355 MHz. When the scan strategy is created, the frequency range of the dwell may be rounded down to 1250 MHz\u20131350 MHz, so that the minimum frequency of the dwell (i.e., 1250 MHz) is an integer multiple of the tuning step size (i.e., 10 MHz)., 112154=For instance, expanding on the previous example, add an Emitter #3 with Pop On and a frequency range 1000\u20131450 MHz. There is no 1000 MHz emitter, so therefore their may be a conflict-free solution to cover emitter #2, so one viable solution would include creating a dwell at bandwidth 450\u20131450, another at 2050\u20133050 and a pair of 250 MHz dwells to cover emitter #2, at bandwidths 1500\u20131750, 1750\u20132000., 195469=However, by altering the frequency at which the initial dwell is constructed, other possible scan strategies may be constructed. For example, suppose that the initial dwell is constructed using the RF Min of emitter E2 (i.e., 1150 MHz). A scan strategy such as scan strategy 7003 may result. In scan strategy 7003, the initial dwell, Dwell 1, uses detecting method M1 and covers the 1150\u20131250 MHz range. Because the information matrix would not be empty after the construction of Dwell 1, Dwells 2 and 3 may be constructed to cover the portion of the frequency spectrum in which emitter E1 operates, but which is not covered by Dwell 1. Thus, by varying the RF Min at which the initial dwell is constructed, different lower cost scan strategies may result.}",

Such modifications and improvements are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description is by way of example only, and is not intended as limiting. The invention is limited only as defined by the following claims and equivalents thereto. If the dwell duration did not bracket at least one pulse, T may be increased by RVT plus process noise jitter and it may again be determined if T intersects one of the illumination periods, as described above. Otherwise, T may be recorded as a valid time-to-intercept value for this Monte Carlo trial and the algorithm may proceed to next trial. Once the antenna scan pattern is determined, a series of Monte Carlo trials may be performed. For each Monte Carlo trial, the following acts may be performed. First antenna pointing angle (antenna scan start) is randomized. The revisit time (RVT) may then be scaled by the load factor (i.e., RVT=RVT\ufffdUtilization). Next, the initial time T (i.e., time for first dwell execution) is set as a random value of process noise jitter. Next it is determined if T intersects one of the illumination periods of the scan pattern. If T does not intersect one of the illuminations, then T may be incremented by RVT plus",
