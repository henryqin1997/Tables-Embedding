Other than preferred media formulations given in Section H, the air filter arrangement 202 is described in commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 09/437,867, filed Nov. 10, 1999, incorporated by reference herein. In general, the air filter arrangement 202 includes a first, or primary filter element 220 (FIG. 30 and 32) and a second filter element 222 (FIG. 31 and 32), which acts as a prefilter. By the term \u201cprefilter\u201d, it is meant a separator that is positioned upstream of the main, primary filter element 220, that functions to remove large particles from the gas stream. The primary filter element 220 and the prefilter element 222 are preferably secured within a sleeve member 224 that is removably mountable in an aperture 226 in tube sheet 203. In general, air flow is taken into the system 200 and flows first through the prefilter element 222 and then through the primary filter element 220. After exiting the primary filter element 220, the air is directed into the generator 205., 212133=Oligomers of para-tert-butyl phenol, molecular weight range 400 to 1100, was purchased from Enzymol International, Columbus, Ohio. These low molecular weight polymers are soluble in low alcohols, such as ethanol, isopropanol and butanol. These polymers were added to co-polyamide described earlier and electrospun into 0.2 micron fibers without adverse consequences. Some polymers and additives hinder the electrospinning process. Unlike the conventional phenolic resin described in Example 2, we have found that this group of polymers does not interfere with fiber forming process., 140752=In FIG. 26, certain portions 146 are depicted showing the flutes, including the open and closed ends. It should be understood that this portion or section 146 is representative of the entire flow face 140 (as well as the first flow face 138). For the sake of clarity and simplicity, the flutes are not depicted in the other remaining portions 149 of the flow face 140. Top and bottom plan views, as well as side elevational views of the media pack 130 usable in the systems and arrangements described herein are depicted in copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 29/101,193, filed Feb. 26, 1999, and entitled, \u201cFilter Element Having Sealing System,\u201d herein and incorporated by reference., 129882=Attention is again directed to FIG. 22. In FIG. 22, the second flow face 150 is shown schematically. There is a portion at 182 in which the flutes including the open ends 184 and closed ends 178 are depicted. It should be understood that this section 182 is representative of the entire flow face 50. For the sake of clarity and simplicity, the flutes are not depicted in the other remaining portions 183 of the flow face 150. Top and bottom plan views, as well as side elevational views of a media pack 140 usable in the systems and arrangements described herein are depicted in copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 29/101,193, filed Feb. 26, 1999, and entitled, \u201cFilter Element Having Sealing System,\u201d herein incorporated by reference., 146789=In FIG. 33, an example of the air intake of a microturbine is illustrated generally at 210. In general, microturbines are smaller versions of gas turbines typically used as stand-by generators. In some instances, such microturbines are approximately 24 inches by 18 inches and have electrical power output typically between 30 kilowatts and 100 kilowatts. These systems typically have air flow between 1000 cfm and 10,000 cfm., 65953=This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119(e) to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/230,138, filed on Sep. 5, 2000, incorporated by reference herein., 252346=DSC of 50:50 blend shows lack of melting temperature. Copolyamide has melting temperature around 150 degree C. and Bisphenol A resin is a glassy polymer with Tg of about 100. The blend shows lack of distinct melting. When the fiber mat is exposed to 100 degree C., the fiber mat disappears. This blend would make an excellent filter media where upper use temperature is not very high, but low-pressure drop is required. This polymer system could not be crosslinked with a reasonable manner., 114011=The engine air intake need is a function of the engine size, i.e. displacement and rpm at maximum, full or \u201crated\u201d load. In general, it is the product of displacement and rated rpm, modified by the volumetric efficiency, a factor which reflects turbo efficiency, duct efficiency, etc. In general, it is a measurement of the volume of air, per unit time, required by the engine or other system involved, during rated operation or full load. While air intake need will vary depending upon rpm, the air intake requirement is defined at a rated rpm, often at 1800 rpm or 2100 rpm for many typical truck engines. Herein this will be characterized as the \u201crated air flow\u201d or by similar terms. In general, principles characterized herein can be applied to air cleaner arrangements used with systems specified for operation over a wide range of ratings or demands, including, for example, ones in the range of about 3 cubic feet/min. (cfm) up to 10,000 cfm often 50 to 500 cfm. Such equipment includes, for example: small utility engines (motorcycles, lawn mowers, etc.), automotive engines, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicle engines, engines for small trucks and delivery vehicles, buses, over-the-highway trucks, agricultural equipment (for example tractors), construction equipment, mining equipment, marine engines, a variety of generator engines, and, in some instances, gas turbines and air compressors., 279017=Source: Modern Plastics Encyclopedia 1998, 225757=Type 8 Nylon was originally developed to prepare soluble and crosslinkable resin for coating and adhesive application. This type of polymer is made by the reaction of polyamide 66 with formaldehyde and alcohol in the presence of acid. (Ref. Cairns, T. L.; Foster, H. D.; Larcher, A. W.; Schneider, A. K.; Schreiber, R. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949, 71, 651). This type of polymer can be electrospun and can be cross-linked. However, formation of fiber from this polymer is inferior to copolyamides and crosslinking can be tricky., 192805=In preferred arrangements, the first layer of permeable coarse fibrous material comprises a material which, if evaluated separately from a remainder of the construction by the Frazier permeability test, would exhibit a permeability of at least 1 meter(s)/min, and typically and preferably about 2-900 meters/min. Herein when reference is made to efficiency, unless otherwise specified, reference is meant to efficiency when measured according to ASTM-1215-89, with 0.78\u03bc monodisperse polystyrene spherical particles, at 20 fpm (6.1 meters/min) as described herein., 157676=Another example of an air filter arrangement 213 usable in the system 304 or system 302 is shown in FIGS. 34-36. With the exception of preferred media formulations provided in Section H below, the air filter arrangement is described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/593,257 filed Jun. 13, 2000, incorporated by reference herein., 251985=50:50 blend of Bisphenol A resin of M.W. 3,000 and copolyamide was made in ethanol solution. Total concentration in solution was 10%. Copolyamide alone would have resulted in 0.2 micron fiber diameter. Blend resulted in lofty layer of fibers around 1 micron. Bisphenol A of 7,000 M.W. is not stable with copolyamide and tends to precipitate., 151452=In certain preferred embodiments, there will be at least 15 pleats 237, no greater than 80 pleats 237, and typically 30-50 pleats 237. The pleated construction 236 is made from a media 240 that is folded in the form of pleats 237 centered around a central core 241. Useable types of media 240 includes fiberglass, or alternatively, an air laid media. Specific properties of usable media 240 include: a dry laid filter medium made from polyester fibers randomly oriented to form a web having a weight of 2.7-3.3 oz./yd3 (92-112 g/m3); a free thickness (i.e., thickness at 0.002 psi compression) of 0.25-0.40 in. (6.4-10.2 mm); and a permeability of at least 400 ft./min (122 m/min)., 313682=A 4\u2033 diameter sample is cut from the media. Particle capture efficiency of the test specimen is calculated using 0.8 \u03bcm latex spheres as a test challenge contaminant in the LEFS (for a description of the LEFS test, see ASTM Standard F1215-89) bench operating at 20 FPM. The sample is then submerged in (typically 140\ufffd F.) distilled water for 5 minutes. The sample is then placed on a drying rack and dried at room temperature (typically overnight). Once it is dry the sample is then retested for efficiency on the, 210197=We were able to produce comparable fiber from the blends. The 50:50 blend could not be cross-linked via heat as the fibrous structure was destroyed. Heating 65:35 blend below 90 degree C. for 12 hours improves the chemical resistance of the resultant fibers to resist dissolution in alcohol. Blends of polyamide with epoxy resin, such Epon 828 from Shell and Epi-Rez 510 can be used.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above specification, examples and data provide an explanation of the invention. However, many variations and embodiments can be made to the disclosed invention. The invention is embodied in the claims herein after appended. Pass/Fail Criteria: >50% efficiency retention. The sample is then placed on a drying rack and dried at room temperature (typically overnight). Once it is dry the sample is then retested for efficiency on the LEFS bench using the same conditions for the initial calculation. The previous steps are repeated for the fine fiber supporting substrate without fine fiber. From the above information one can calculate the efficiency component due only to the fine fiber and the resulting loss in efficiency due to alcohol damage. Once the loss in efficiency due to the fine fiber is determined one can calculate the amount of efficiency retained. A 4\u2033 diameter sample is cut from the media. Particle capture efficiency of the test specimen is calculated using 0.8 \u03bcm latex spheres as a test challenge contaminant in the LEFS bench operating at 20 FPM. The sample is then submerged in alcohol for 1 minute. Procedure: Description: The test uses the LEFS test bench to measure filter media performance changes upon immersion in room temperature ethanol. Alcohol (Ethanol) Soak Test In most industrial pulse cleaning filter applications the filter would perform adequately if at least 50% of the fine fiber efficiency",
