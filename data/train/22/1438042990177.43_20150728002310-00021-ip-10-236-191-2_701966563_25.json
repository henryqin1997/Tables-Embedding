Screen Input Options Meteorological Data: No need for meteorological data input. The model automatically examines a full range of meteorological conditions, including all stability classes and wind speeds to find maximum impacts. Receptor Data: Receptor distances from the source are needed. If modeling on elevated terrain, the terrain height at the receptor location should be specified. Source Input Volume: leaking gases from a plant, conveyor belts. Flares: burning gas from a landfill gas collection. Area: landfills, lagoons, VOCs emanating from a SuperFund site. Point: stacks, soil vapor extraction vents. A complete graphics package is also available within Screen View. Screen View comes with a context-sensitive \"Help that really helps\" which includes the basic explanations for each option or command and incorporates many sections of EPA's most-used documentation guides to help you better understand the modeling process.",
    "textAfterTable": "Building Downwash Option: The building downwash option is only applicable to Point and Flare source types. Downwash occurs when the aerodynamic turbulence induced by nearby buildings cause a pollutant emitted from an elevated source to be mixed rapidly toward the ground (downwash), resulting in higher ground-level concentrations. Complex Terrain Option: The complex terrain option is only applicable to Point and Flare source types. The complex terrain option of Screen calculates maximum 24-hour concentrations for terrain elevations exceeding stack height. Simple Terrain Option: When modeling simple terrain, you are given the option of modeling either: Simple Flat Terrain: where terrain heights are assumed not to exceed stack base elevation. If this option is used, terrain height is considered to be 0.0 m. Simple Elevated Terrain (Not Available for Area Sources): where terrain heights exceed stack base but are below stack height. If this option is used, the terrain height above stack base should be specified. If terrain heights above physical stack height are entered, Screen View gives a warning message and the user has to",
