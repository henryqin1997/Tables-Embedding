    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{8635=The \"Big One\" ( Part Number BO-PM-B200 ) is a giant 2.00 inch (50.8mm) diameter precision sphere mounted on a rugged 2.00 inch (50.8mm) diameter by 2-1/2 inch (63.5mm) high steel post. It was developed for the evaluation of Computer Numerically Controlled Machining Centers according to ANSI/ASME B 5.54.1992. It is also used as a probe characterizing sphere on some Coordinate Measuring Machines. The large target is particularly well-suited for use on big machines and on multi-spindle machines. Some of these tests include Machine Tool Repeatability, Temperature Variation Error, Hysteresis, Feature Accuracy, Pallet Change Repeatability, Tool Changer Repeatability, Drift, Vibration and Compliance., 9360=The surface area of this 2.00 inch ( 50.8mm ) diameter sphere is 12.566 square inches ( 319.19 square mm ) which is four times the 3.1416 square inch (79.797 square mm) area of the standard 1.00 inch ( 25.4 mm ) diameter sphere commonly used. The 2.00 inch (50.8mm) diameter precision sphere is made of very fine grain high chrome, high carbon stainless steel that is hardened to 58 HRC for wear resistance and cold cycled for long-term dimensional stability. This large diameter component is lapped spherical within 5 millionths of an inch (127nm) and has a surface finish below 0.7 micro inches (17.78 nm) Ra. The exact diameter of the sphere can be certified to 10 millionths of an inch (254nm)., 29962=We have changed the magnet to use 3 smaller magnets due to the high cost of the larger diameter magnet material. The 4.00 inch (101.6 mm) diameter magnetic platform was developed to hold the target sphere for evaluating Computer Numerically Controlled Machining Centers according to ANSI-ASME B 5.54-1992. The commonly used target sphere is a 1.00 inch (25.4 mm) diameter Ultra Precise Sphere mounted on a 1-1/4 inch (31.75 mm) diameter post, ( Part Number PM-UB-B100 )., 30445=Another popular target sphere that is compatible with this magnetic platform is the \"Big One\". It is particularly well-suited for the evaluation of large and multi-spindle machines. This device (Part Number PM-PB-B 200) incorporates a huge 2.00 inch (50.8 mm) diameter sphere mounted on a robust 2.00 inch (50.8 mm diameter by 2-1/2 inch (63.5 mm) high steel post. The surface area of this sphere is four times as great as the area of the standard 1.00 inch sphere. The surface area of a 1.00 inch (25.4 mm) sphere is 3.1416 square inches (79.797 square mm) and the surface area of the 2.00 inch (50.8 mm) diameter sphere is, 68947=The overall height of the Runt\u2122 equipped with a 1.00 inch ( 25.4 mm ) diameter sphere is only 2.35 inches ( 59.7 mm), which is a full inch shorter than the standard versions. Although it is manufactured to the highest quality standards, the Runt\u2122 is sold for a very reasonable price. The quality of the sphere for the standard version of the Runt ( Part Number PM-PB-B100-R ) is held to a five microinch ( 127 mm ) sphericity which meets the quality requirements for the revised ANSI-B89.4.1- 1997 specification for the \"Performance Evaluation of Coordinate Measuring Machines.\" The quality of the sphere for the Ultra Precision version of the Runt\u2122 is two and one half microinch ( 63.5 nm ) sphericity which is state of the art for calibrating the test probes of the highest quality machines.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Pricing Five sphere calibration spheres mounted on the 2\" by 2\" block, creates ten inter-sphere dimensions that are, in effect, ten unique length Ball Bars. The assembly of these 5 devices is a \"pretzel\" that exercises every function of your Coordinate Measuring Machine. Having the several extra probe calibration spheres available will provide you with the in house hardware to perform frequent temperature drift evaluations. Our entire family of probe calibration hardware is designed to be compatible with the 2\" by 2\" blocks. The simplest application is to use it as a 2 inch riser to hold any of our probe calibration spheres. The 2\" by 2\" block can be used to mount any of our probe calibration spheres at right angles to the C.M.M. table. Mounting up to five of our standard probe calibration spheres creates an excellent star probe calibration device. Leaving it mounted on the CMM table with several of the calibration spheres attached provides a monument that will quickly provide proof of performance as an interim evaluation of your C.M.M. We offer the 2 inch by 2 inch universal mounting block, Part Number BLK-2, as an accessory for use with the probe calibration sphere hardware. The four threaded tie down holes are M10-1.5 thread. A through mounting hole with clearance for 10mm or 3/8 inch tie down bolt is provided. This approach to tie down allows the two inch square by two inch high block to be clamped down in any angular position.",
    "textAfterTable": "Angle Block with Probe Characterization Sphere ( Priced Separately ) Downloads PDF Solidworks IGES The 45 Degree Angle Block ( Part Number BLK-45 ) is used to hold Probe Characterizing Spheres inclined at 45 degrees, so they are more accessible for C.M.M. calibration. The block may be located in an out of the way place on the CMM table, while projecting the characterizing sphere out into the working zone of the machine. This robust steel angle block is 3-1/2 inch ( 3.5\", 88.9mm ) long by 1-1/2 inch (1.5\", 63.5mm ) high and 1-1/2 inch ( 1.5\", 38.1mm ) wide. Two tapped holes that are M10 inch diameter are provided to secure the characterizing sphere's 1-1/4 inch ( 1.25\", 31.75mm ) diameter post. One tapped hole is provided in the center of the 1-1/2 inch ( 1.5\", 38.1mm ) long 45 degree land, and one is provided in the top surface near the end opposite the 45 degree angle. The base surface that locates this 45 degree block has areas of the surface relieved to leave three mounting pads. These pads are lapped flat and coplanar",
