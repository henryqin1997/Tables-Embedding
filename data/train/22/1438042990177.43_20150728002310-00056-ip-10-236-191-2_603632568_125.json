    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{188399=January 12, 2015, 188489=Two University of Newcastle (UON) cancer researchers from the School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy in the Faculty of Health and Medicine have been awarded more than $1 million in Cancer Council NSW project grants for 2015., 13328=Background: \u00c3\u009f-Agonists are used for relief and control of asthma symptoms by reversing bronchoconstriction. They might also have anti-inflammatory properties, but the underpinning mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recently, a direct interaction between formoterol and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been described in\u00c2\u00bfvitro. Objective: We sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which \u00c3\u009f-agonists exert anti-inflammatory effects in allergen-driven and rhinovirus 1B-exacerbated allergic airways disease (AAD). Methods: Mice were sensitized and then challenged with house dust mite to induce AAD while receiving treatment with salmeterol, formoterol, or salbutamol. Mice were also infected with rhinovirus 1B to exacerbate lung inflammation and therapeutically administered salmeterol, dexamethasone, or the PP2A-activating drug (S)-2-amino-4-(4-[heptyloxy]phenyl)-2-methylbutan-1-ol (AAL[S]). Results: Systemic or intranasal administration of salmeterol protected against the development of allergen- and rhinovirus-induced airway hyperreactivity and decreased eosinophil recruitment to the lungs as effectively as dexamethasone. Formoterol and salbutamol also showed anti-inflammatory properties. Salmeterol, but not dexamethasone, increased PP2A activity, which reduced CCL11, CCL20, and CXCL2 expression and reduced levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and active nuclear factor \u00c2\u00bfB subunits in the lungs. The anti-inflammatory effect of salmeterol was blocked by targeting the catalytic subunit of PP2A with small RNA interference. Conversely, increasing PP2A activity with AAL(S) abolished rhinovirus-induced airway hyperreactivity, eosinophil influx, and CCL11, CCL20, and CXCL2 expression. Salmeterol also directly activated immunoprecipitated PP2A in\u00c2\u00bfvitro isolated from human airway epithelial cells. Conclusions: Salmeterol exerts anti-inflammatory effects by increasing PP2A activity in AAD and rhinovirus-induced lung inflammation, which might potentially account for some of its clinical benefits. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology., 199240=Copyright 2015 CRICOS Provider Number 00109J The University of Newcastle, Australia, 17273=Calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a multi-functional serine/threonine protein kinase that controls a range of cellular functions, including proliferation. The biological properties of CaMKII are regulated by multi-site phosphorylation and targeting via interactions with specific proteins. To investigate the role specific CaMKII phosphorylation sites play in controlling cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, we examined phosphorylation of CaMKII at two sites (T253 and T286) at various stages of the cell cycle, and also examined the effects of overexpression of wild-type (WT), T286D phosphomimic, T253D phosphomimic and T253V phosphonull forms of CaMKIIa in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells on cellular proliferation and cell cycle progression. We demonstrate herein that whilst there is no change in total CaMKII expression or T286 phosphorylation throughout the cell cycle, a marked dephosphorylation of CaMKII at T253 occurs during the G2 and/or M phases. Additionally, we show by molecular inhibition, as well as pharmacological activation, that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is the phosphatase responsible for this dephosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that inducible overexpression of WT, T286D and T253V forms of CaMKIIa in MDA-MB-231 and SHSY5Y cells increases cellular proliferation, with no alteration in cell cycle profiles. By contrast, overexpression of a T253D phosphomimic form of CaMKIIa significantly decreases proliferation, and cells accumulate in mitosis, specifically in metaphase. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the dephosphorylation of CaMKII at T253 is involved in controlling the cell cycle, specifically the metaphase-anaphase transition. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc., 187370=May 1, 2015}",
