    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6001=For systems with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 installed, you will need to apply the KB2687356 update for Windows SharePoint Services 3.0. There is no configuration where you can only have Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and not Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0., 6321=How is Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 related to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007? \u00a0 Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 is an integrated suite of server capabilities built on top of Windows SharePoint Services 3.0., 32341=Published: October 09, 2012 | Updated: January 15, 2014, 6715=What is Microsoft Groove Server 2010? \u00a0 Microsoft Groove Server 2010 provides comprehensive services for managing Microsoft SharePoint Workspace. Groove Server 2010 contains two components: Groove Server 2010 Manager and Groove Server 2010 Relay, each of which runs on a Windows server on an enterprise network., 7430=For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, depending on their configuration of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server, not all the server-package updates listed in this bulletin may apply. For more information on the applicability of these server-package updates in a SharePoint environment, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2741517., 31817=This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft InfoPath 2007, Microsoft InfoPath 2010, Microsoft Communicator 2007 R2, Microsoft Lync 2010, Microsoft Lync 2010 Attendee, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft Groove Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Windows Services 3.0, Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010, and Microsoft Office Web Apps 2010.

The security update packages for Microsoft Office Web Apps 2010 Service Pack 1 (KB2687401) in this bulletin, MS12-066, also address the vulnerabilities described in MS12-064., 30993=Recommendation.\u00a0Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the Microsoft Update service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871. For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see Understanding Windows automatic updating., 29372=Known Issues.\u00a0Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2741517 documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles., 3932=Why is the Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) update only available from the Microsoft Download Center?\u00a0 Microsoft is releasing the update for Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) to the Microsoft Download Center only. Because the user level installation of Lync 2010 Attendee is handled through a Lync session, distribution methods such as automatic updating are not appropriate for this type of installation scenario., 8885=For example, Microsoft InfoPath 2010 is included in Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010. Systems with Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 will be offered updates for InfoPath 2010 whether InfoPath 2010 is installed or not. This would not be the case for Microsoft Office Standard 2010, because InfoPath 2010 is not included in Office Standard 2010., 16073=[1]For supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, in addition to the security update package for Microsoft SharePoint 2007 (KB2687405), customers also need to install the security update for Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 (KB2687356) to be protected from the vulnerability described in this bulletin., 4995=What is Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010? \u00a0 Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 is the new version of Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services. It is the essential solution for organizations that need a secure, manageable, web-based collaboration platform. SharePoint helps teams stay connected and productive by providing easy access to the people, documents, and information that they need to make well-informed decisions and get work done. Use SharePoint Foundation to coordinate schedules, organize documents, and participate in discussions through team workspaces, blogs, wikis, and document libraries on the platform that is the underlying infrastructure for SharePoint Server., 3380=Where are the hashes of the security updates?\u00a0 The SHA1 and SHA2 hashes of the security updates can be used to verify the authenticity of downloaded security update packages. For the hash information pertaining to this update, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2741517., 570=The following severity ratings assume the potential maximum impact of the vulnerability. For information regarding the likelihood, within 30 days of this security bulletin's release, of the exploitability of the vulnerability in relation to its severity rating and security impact, please see the Exploitability Index in the October bulletin summary.
