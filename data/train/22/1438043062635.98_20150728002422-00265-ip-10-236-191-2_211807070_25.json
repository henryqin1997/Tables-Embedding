The Indiana Section Selection Committee will choose one of the nominees for the Section Award. The awardee will be honored at the 2005 Spring Section meeting and will be widely recognized and acknowledged within the Section. The awardee will also be the official Section candidate for the pool of Section awardees from which the national recipients of the Deborah and Franklin Tepper Haimo Awards will be selected (except that one of the national winners may be selected from another source). There will be at most three national awardees, each of whom will be honored at the national MAA meeting in January 2006 and receive a $1000 check and a certificate., 7131=On Friday and Saturday there will be a PMET (Preparing Mathematicians to Educate Teachers) mini-course run by Magnhild Lien from California State University Northridge. There will also be a Project NExT Workshop run by Will Turner (Wabash College) and Tom Langley (Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology). This is a follow-up workshop from our Fall 2004 Evansville Meeting (November 5-6, 2004)., 41500=Signature Inn 1734 W. Washington Center Rd.

The books are philosophical in nature, contain few original results and no formal proofs. They abound, however, in intriguing number theoretic observations. We discuss and extend some of the results found in these ancient volumes. Secondly, we discuss the mathematics of Gerbert the Great, a tenth century educator. We end with the achievements and adventures of Louis Antoine de Bougainville, mathematician, explorer, and student of D'Alembert., 113309=so as to be received no later than February 1, 2005., 113369=The Section Selection Committee will select the Section awardee prior to February 15, 2005, at which time it will communicate its selection to the national selection committee so that the national committee can then make its selections. We look forward to your participation in this exciting MAA venture of taking substantive action to honor extraordinarily successful teaching. We want to see such teaching recognized at all post-secondary schools. We depend on you to help us identify those who merit such recognition., 22571=EPISODES IN THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE LUCASIAN CHAIR In 1663, Henry Lucas, the long-time secretary to the Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, made a bequest, subsequently granted by Charles II, to endow a chair in mathematics. A number of conditions were attached to the Chair. Among the more prominent Lucasian professors were Newton, Babbage, Stokes, Dirac, and Hawking. We focus attention on the early Lucasians. Many of whom were very diligent in carrying out their Lucasian responsibilities but as history has shown such was not always the case. In the process, we uncover several untold stories and some interesting mathematics., 38071=Don Hall's Guesthouse 1313 W.
