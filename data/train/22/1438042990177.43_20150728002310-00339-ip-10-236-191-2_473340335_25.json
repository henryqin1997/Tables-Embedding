    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6372=0.3 ml of fresh buffer was added back to the beads and the mixture was vortexed again. The beads were centrifuged as above, and 150 ul of the supernatant was removed via pipette and placed into the well of a UV-transparent 96-well microtiter plate (VWR Scientific, Bridgeport, N.J.). An aliquot of 0.3 ml of a 400 mg/dl glucose solution in 100 mM BES buffer, pH 7.0, 1.0 M NaCl, 1 mM MnCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2 was added to give a final concentration of 200 mg/dl glucose solution when mixed with the 150 ul bead suspension. The bead suspension was revortexed, and the P62 or P64 was allowed to bind for 15 minutes. The bead suspension was centrifuged, and 150 ul of the supernatant was pipetted out of the vial and placed into another well on the 96-well plate. The process was repeated to assay binding at 400, 800, and 1600 mg/dl glucose solutions. The process was repeated a final time using a solution of 0.1 M methyl-\u03b1-D-mannopyranoside, which is a potent inhibitor of the Con A binding site. The individual wells of the 96-well plate were assayed for their optical density at a wavelength of 280 nm, in order to characterize the protein content of each well using a commercially available plate reader (SpectraMAX, Molecular Devices, Mountain View, Calif.). The results of the binding example are shown below in FIG. 10.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{86130=In another embodiment, the T-cell mitogenicity of an inventive composition is less than 50% the T-cell mitogenicity of an otherwise equivalent composition that comprises a plurality of unmodified lectins (e.g., the native lectin composition). As previously discussed, the reduction in T-cell mitogenicity is generally assessed by performing a comparative thymidine uptake assay across a range lectin concentrations, e.g., 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ug/ml. In preferred embodiments, the thymidine uptake assay is performed with samples that include approximately 500,000 PBMCs. The mitogenicity of the test composition (e.g., a chemically modified composition) is then expressed as the % maximal native mitogenicity. The % maximal native mitogenicity is obtained by dividing the maximal CPM (counts per minute) value for the test composition over all measured concentrations by the maximal CPM value of the native lectin composition over all measured concentrations. Preferably, the test composition with reduced mitogenicity induces a level of T-cell proliferation that is at least 50% lower than the native lectin composition. More preferably, the level is at least 75% lower, even more preferably at least 90%, 95% or 99% lower., 153521=This example describes the preparation of pegylated Con A composition P39. P39 was prepared essentially as described in Kim and Park, Pharmaceutical Research 18:794-799, 2001 for the preparation of their \u201cPEG-5-Con A\u201d., 116718=In some of the examples, the modified lectin compositions were purified free of reaction byproducts and unreacted reagents through ultrafiltration. In the case of pegylated Con A compositions, the compositions were taken from their reaction mixtures at a concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml (on a Con A reagent mass basis) and ultrafiltered at room temperature using a 200 ml size stirred cell (Amicon Model 3000, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass.) using a 50 kD MW cut-off filtration disc (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass.). The solutions were extensively ultrafiltered against 100 mM BES buffer at pH 7 containing 1000 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MnCl2 to remove unreacted pegylation agent, and then extensively against deionized water containing 1 mM CaCl2 and MnCl2. The role of manganese and calcium ions has been described previously (Sophianopoulos et al., Prep. Biochem. 11:413-435, 1981). The resulting solutions were then lyophilized to yield essentially pure, pegylated Con A compositions., 279350=The elution profile can be obtained for 20 mg of unmodified insulin and maltose-insulin applied to columns (24.0\ufffd1.5 cm I.D.) of immobilized modified Con A composition P62. The initial buffer can be 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. At a particular point in time, 0.2 M glucose in the column buffer can begin. Fractions (e.g., 2.0 ml) can be collected at a flow rate of 10-15 ml/hour. Unmodified insulin should not bind to modified Con A. When this material is applied to the modified lectin, all of the protein should be recovered in the buffer wash, and none will be eluted by the addition of glucose. In contrast, all of the maltose-insulin derivative should be bound to the modified Con A, since P62 is known to bind mono and trisaccharides just as well if not better than native Con A. None of the maltose-insulin should be eluted by the buffer wash, and all of the maltose-insulin derivative should be displaced from modified Con A binding sites by a 1,000:1 molar excess of glucose., 27387=This application claims priority to U.S. Ser. No. 60/728,652 filed Oct. 19, 2005. The entire contents of this application are hereby incorporated by reference., 322895=In addition, protein sites of the native lectin monomer that may be available for reaction with the polymeric agent, include cysteines (thiols), carboxyl groups (C termini sites, glutamates), aromatic alcohols (tyrosines), amines (N termini sites, histidines, lysines, and asparagines), and other lectin monomer amino acid moieties. Other custom functionalities may also be introduced into the lectin monomer via site directed mutagenesis using methods that are well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., see Smith et al., Protein Sci. 14:64-73, 2005 and De Lorimier et al., Protein Sci. 11:2655-2675, 2002)., 113147=Similarly, a negative control well was made by adding 100 ul of the 10 mg/ml glycogen solution to one separate well on the microtiter plate, and one positive control well was made by mixing 50 ul of the glycogen solution with 50 ul of a 10 mg/ml native lectin solution in pH 7, 100 mM BES buffer containing 1000 mM sodium chloride and 1 mM manganese chloride and 1 mM calcium chloride., 67430=In certain embodiments PEGs may be attached to a lectin via an intervening linker. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,460, discloses urethane linkers for connecting polyethylene glycol to proteins. PEGs can be attached to a lectin via a linker by reaction with compounds such as MPEG-succinimidylsuccinate, MPEG activated with 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole, MPEG-2,4,5-trichloropenylcarbonate, MPEG-p-nitrophenolcarbonate, and various MPEG-succinate derivatives. In the Examples below we described the use of succinimidyl propionic acid activated MPEG. Kim and Park (supra) describe the use of MPEG p-nitrophenol carbonate. Ueno et al. (supra) describe the modification of lectins using a branched MPEG, namely 2,4-bis[O-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)]-6-chloro-s-triazine. A number additional PEG derivatives and reaction chemistries for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in WO 98/32466 and other patents, e.g., those that are assigned to Shearwater of Huntsville, Ala.; Nektar Therapeutics of San Carlos, Calif.; and/or Enzon Pharmaceuticals of Bridgewater, N.J. Catalogues can be obtained from these commercial PEG suppliers that describe a range of suitable PEG compounds and chemistries (e.g., see the Nektar Advanced PEGylation CATALOG 2004)., 161651=The mitogenicity of compositions P26 and P39 were evaluated at 1000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 ug/ml as described in Example 1. The SDS-PAGE separations of P26 and P39 were performed as described in Example 5 using a 15% gel., 275516=This example demonstrates how modified Con A composition P64 was used in a system that is capable of detecting glucose based on the changes in viscosity of a glucose-responsive solution. P64 was synthesized according to the generalized procedure of Example 8 using PEG-SPA-2K at a PEG:Con A monomer molar ratio of 10, or a PEG:Con A mass ratio of 1. P64 was then dissolved in a 20 mM BES buffer at pH 7 containing 1 mM MnCl2 and CaCl2 at a concentration of 100 mg Con A equivalents/ml. Separately, yeast mannan (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was dissolved in five solutions of 200 mM BES buffer at pH 7 at a concentration of 50 mg/ml with each solution containing 0, 100, 800, 1600, and 3200 mg/dl of glucose, respectively. 0.700 ml of the P64 stock solution was mixed with each of the five mannan stock solutions containing the varying concentrations of glucose such that the five resulting solutions contained 0, 50, 400, 800, and 1600 mg/dl of glucose., 140413=Example 16 describes the preparation of a comparative pegylated Con A composition according to the teachings of Kim and Park, Pharmaceutical Research 18:794-799, 2001. This sample is referred to herein as P39 or the \u201cPark sample.\u201d, 273541=After measuring with both sets of filter pairs using the 1200 mg/dl glucose buffer at room temperature, the plate was heated to 37 C. using the plate reader incubator function. After 30 minutes of equilibration, the plate was read for both FITC and TRITC fluorescence a second time. After which the plate was allowed to recool to room temperature., 272357=(iii) Glucose Stock\u2014a 1200 mg/dl glucose solution was made by dissolving 1200 mg glucose in 100 ml of 100 mM BES, pH 7, 1.0 M NaCl, 1 mM MnCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2., 51480=Reduced T-cell mitogenicity\u2014A lectin composition is said to exhibit \u201creduced T-cell mitogenicity\u201d or \u201creduced mitogenicity\u201d as compared to a native lectin composition if it induces a detectably lower level of T-cell proliferation as measured by a thymidine uptake assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from one or more healthy patients. Generally, the comparative assay is performed across a range lectin concentrations, e.g., 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ug/ml. In preferred embodiments, the thymidine uptake assay is performed with samples that include approximately 500,000 PBMCs. The mitogenicity of the test composition (e.g., a chemically modified composition) is then expressed as the % maximal native mitogenicity. The % maximal native mitogenicity is obtained by dividing the maximal CPM (counts per minute) value for the test composition over all measured concentrations by the maximal CPM value of the native lectin composition over all measured concentrations. Preferably, the test composition with reduced mitogenicity induces a level of T-cell proliferation that is at least 50% lower than the native lectin composition. More preferably, the level is at least 75% lower, even more preferably at least 90%, 95% or 99% lower., 188471=The mitogenicity of each sample was then evaluated as described in Example 1. The evaluation was performed over a broader range of concentrations than in previous examples, namely at 1000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01 ug/ml. The binding constant of each composition for \u03b1-methyl mannose and/or mannotriose was also evaluated as described in Example 4., 133498=In a separate experiment, dextran standards of various molecular weights (4-2000 kD, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) were run under identical conditions to generate a calibration curve to correlate dextran molecular weight with column retention time. This allowed the native and pegylated Con A sample molecular sizes to be determined as a dextran-equivalent molecular weight. The results for the native Con A and pegylated Con A compositions are shown in Table 2., 267383=Example 39 describes the use of inventive lectin compositions in a glucose-responsive drug delivery system that makes use of an insulin-polysaccharide drug conjugate (e.g., the system of U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0202719)., 278738=Maltose is incubated with porcine insulin at a molar ratio of 650:1 for 5 days at 37 C. in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 8. The incubation is carried out in the presence and absence of 0.25 M sodium cyanoborohydride. Unreacted maltose is removed by gel filtration and the conjugated insulin is separated by affinity chromatography, e.g., on a Con A column. The insulin conjugate can be stored at 4 C. and is stable for at least seven weeks regardless of whether or not reducing agent had been added., 303898=This example demonstrates how the crosslinked Con A of Example 40 can be used in a glucose-responsive drug delivery system such as the one described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0202719. In this example, the lectin is replaced with crosslinked and modified Con A composition PXL13-1 and the insulin-polysaccharide conjugate is replaced with an insulin-glycogen conjugate. However, the mechanism of glucose-responsive release is essentially the same, i.e., the gel formed between the two components is eroded with glucose such that it releases the insulin-polysaccharide conjugate from the surface in a glucose-responsive manner. The release is controlled primarily by competitive binding and not by diffusion as described in Example 38., 101613=This example describes an assay that was used to characterize and thereby compare the T-cell mitogenicity of different lectin compositions. Modifications and alternatives to this typical assay will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), rather than highly purified T-cells, were used for this assay since T-cell activation by lectins generally requires the presence of non-T-cell populations collectively termed accessory cells (e.g., monocytes, dendritic cells). In a typical assay, PBMCs were isolated from the whole blood of three healthy donors and plated out separately at about 100,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate. Triplicate serial dilutions of different lectin compositions (e.g., native and treated) starting at 1000 (or 100) ug/ml concentration were then added to the wells. The plates were incubated for three days at 37 C, at which time 0.8 uCi of 3H-thymidine was added to each well for an additional 18 hours. The degree of mitogenicity was then measured by 3H-thymidine uptake by the proliferating PBMCs. In some cases, the mitogenicity of a lectin composition (e.g., a treated composition) was expressed as the % maximal native mitogenicity. The % maximal native mitogenicity was obtained by dividing the maximal CPM (counts per minute) value for the lectin composition over all measured concentrations by the maximal CPM value of the native lectin composition over all measured compositions., 62670=In one embodiment, the chemical compound or compounds are monovalent. Activated pegylation agents are preferred but non-limiting monovalent chemical compounds of the invention (e.g., without limitation N-hydroxysuccinimide activated PEG, succinimidyl ester of PEG propionic acid, succinimidyl ester of PEG butanoic acid, succinimidyl ester of PEG alpha-methylbutanoate, etc.). Examples 1-43 deal with pegylated Con A, while Example 44 describes the use of a polysaccharide as the chemical compound. Other exemplary monovalent chemical compounds include natural and synthetic amino acids, other water soluble but non-PEG-containing polymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol), reagents that can be easily coupled to lysines, e.g., through the use of carbodiimide reagents, and perfluorinated compounds. The skilled artisan will readily recognize other suitable chemical compounds, e.g., by referring to the comprehensive review that can be found in \u201cChemical Reagents for Protein Modification\u201d by Lundblad, CRC Press, 3rd Edition, 2004., 56887=Kim and Park used pegylation to increase the solution stability of Con A compositions (Kim and Park, Pharmaceutical Research 18:794-799, 2001). Monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) p-nitrophenol carbonate was used as an activated pegylation agent; the reaction was begun at 4 C. and then slowly warmed to room temperature. The reaction mixture was buffered at pH 8.5 and they were able to obtain relatively high levels of pegylation (i.e., up to 77% pegylation or 10/13 available amine group pegylation sites per Con A molecule). The solubility and stability of the modified Con A compositions was increased as compared to native Con A. However, while moderately pegylated Con A molecules (i.e., below 5/13 available amine group pegylation sites) retained the carbohydrate binding properties of native Con A, these properties vanished rapidly if the level of pegylation was increased. Kim and Park were not interested in and did not measure the T-cell mitogenicity of their modified compositions. However, as described in Examples 1, 16, and 17, we have attempted to reproduce their modification protocol and performed mitogenicity assays using human PBMC cells. We found that the maximal T-cell mitogenicity of a modified Con A composition evaluated from 0.01-1000 ug/ml (with about 5/13 available amine group pegylation sites) was 96% of the maximal mitogenicity for native Con A evaluated over the same concentration range., 55154=Ueno used pegylation to prepare modified Con A compositions that stimulate anti-tumor cytotoxicity in peripheral lymphocytes (Ueno et al., Cancer Detection and Prevention 24:100-106, 2000). 2,4-bis[O-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)]-6-chloro-s-triazine was used as an activated pegylation agent and the reaction was performed at 37 C. and pH 10. The maximum level of pegylation that was achieved under these conditions was only about 35% (i.e., 4.5/13 available amine group pegylation sites per Con A molecule). Ueno compared the cytotoxicity, immunoreactivity, immunogenicity and circulation half-lives of native Con A and 35% pegylated Con A. The T-cell mitogenicity of each composition was also measured using murine spleen T-cells at 37 C. in RPMI 1640 medium and was found to be reduced in the modified compositions as compared to native Con A. However, as noted by Ueno, the modified compositions retained the ability to stimulate a proliferative T-cell response. Specifically, the maximal T-cell mitogenicity of a modified Con A composition evaluated from 0.05-400 ug/ml (with about 4.5/13 available amine group pegylation sites) was 79% of the maximal mitogenicity for native Con A evaluated over the same concentration range. As described in Examples 1, 15, and 17, we have also attempted to reproduce the Ueno modification protocol and performed mitogenicity assays using radioactive thymidine uptake on human PBMC cells. We found that the maximal T-cell mitogenicity of a modified Con A composition evaluated from 0.01-100 ug/ml (with about 4.5/13 available amine group pegylation sites) was 31% of the maximal mitogenicity for native Con A evaluated over the same concentration range., 97077=In yet another embodiment the non-mitogenic lectins could be used in a system with a conjugate of a polysaccharide and the therapeutic agent of interest (e.g., based on the teachings of U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0202719). Suitable modified lectins would have at least two binding sites, each with an affinity for glucose and the polysaccharide portion of the conjugate. The conjugate and modified lectin would need to combined under conditions in which the modified lectin cross-links the conjugate to form a water insoluble gelled matrix. When the matrix is placed in a glucose solution the cross-links are competitively dissociated thereby causing an ungelling of the matrix and a release of the conjugate into the solution. It is to be understood that the present invention also provides a composition comprising inventive gelled matrices. Examples 40 and 41 provide additional details and embodiments for this specific application., 108480=SDS-PAGE separations were performed essentially as described by Laemmli, Nature 227:680:685, 1970. Briefly, Laemmli sample buffer was made by mixing 950 ul of 1\ufffd Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) with 50 ul of 2-mercaptoethanol. The desired protein sample was diluted in 1\ufffdPBS buffer to a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. 25 ul of this solution was pipetted into a microcentrifuge tube, followed by 50 ul of 1\ufffd Laemmli Sample Buffer. The centrifuge tube was closed, vortexed briefly, and then placed into boiling water for 5 minutes. After boiling, the sample was cooled in ice-cold water. The desired samples were then pipetted into a BioRad 15-well (15 ul capacity) precast 4-15% gradient polyacrylamide gel and run at 150 V for 70 minutes. The desired samples were run against a mixture of proteins that act as molecular weight standards. After running the gel, the protein bands were fixed in the gel using a 40:10:50 methanol:acetic acid:water mixture by volume for 15 minutes, followed by washing twice with distilled water. The bands were revealed by staining with colloidal Coomassie blue stain for 1.5 hours. The background staining was removed from the gel by 3\ufffd washing in distilled water. Pictures of the bands were taken by placing the developed gels on a light table and capturing images of the gel with a digital camera attached to a personal computer. The relative densities of electrophoretic bands were quantitatively measured by AlphaImage software. Multimeric lectins (e.g., Con A which exists as a tetramer in solution) stain at monomeric molecular weights because of the SDS denaturing gel conditions., 265745=In addition, the mitogenicity of native Con A, P24, and P41 were evaluated at 1000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 ug/ml as described in Example 1. P24 exhibited less than 6% of the maximal native mitogenicity at all evaluated concentrations while P41 exhibited less than 5% of the maximal Con A mitogenicity at all evaluated concentrations. Taken together, these results indicate that modified Con A compositions P24 and P24 are both non-mitogenic and non-antigenic., 121718=In a new beaker, PEG with a MW of 2 kD and the linker group SPA (Succinimidyl Propionate, Nektar Therapeutics, San Carlos, Calif.) was dissolved in pH 7, 100 mM BES containing 1000 mM NaCl at 100 mg/ml by mixing 0.100 g of the PEG-SPA-2k in 1.0 ml of buffer. Because most PEG reagents, including PEG-SPA-2k, are susceptible to hydrolysis in aqueous buffers, the PEG reagent-buffer solution was vortexed to aid in its dissolution and was used quickly (within 15 minutes of dissolution) to prevent undue hydrolysis., 268151=Briefly, in a Schlenk tube under nitrogen, 1 g of mannan (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was dissolved in 20 ml of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) at 95 C. until the solution was clear. Next two drops of pyridine (anhydrous, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) were added to the mixture. 20 mg of TRITC powder was added directly to the heated solution, and then 10 ul of a dibutyltin dilaurate (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was added and the mixture allowed to react for 2 hours, after which time the flask was removed from the temperature bath and allowed to cool. The TRITC-mannan was purified by several precipitation cycles using 50:50 ethanol:diethyl ether mixtures, where the precipitate was centrifuged at 2000\ufffdg for 10 min (Allegra 21R, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.) and redissolved in the minimum amount of deionized water to redissolve the centrifuged particle cake between each precipitation step. This was repeated until no visible red or orange color was visibly seen in the supernatant after centrifuging the solution under the above conditions. The precipitate was redissolved in deionized water a final time and lyophilized to give the purified TRITC-mannan product., 258234=This example provides a method for evaluating the activation of antigens on the surface of human T-cells cultured with various concentrations of native lectin and modified lectin compositions. For example, compositions may be synthesized according to the general procedures described in Example 8. The induced activation of T-cell antigens for each composition is then evaluated at 100, 10, and 1 ug/ml. Briefly, PBMCs are cultured for 1, 3 or 7 days in RPMI1640 medium with 10% FCS, with or without native lectin, modified lectin, or medium alone. Cells are washed, labeled with specific mouse monoclonal antibodies, an anti-mouse fluoresceinated secondary antibody, and then analyzed by fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS). Specific surface structures analyzed include CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25 (the high affinity IL-2 receptor), CD98, and Class II MHC. A variety of other cell surface structures can be analyzed if required. The results from this assay will likely show that inventive modified lectin compositions with reduced mitogenicity have a significantly reduced ability to activate antigens on the surface of human T-cells as compared to the native lectins., 117991=In other examples, the modified lectin compositions were purified free of reaction byproducts and unreacted reagents through equilibrium dialysis. This was found to be particularly convenient when preparing small batches of a modified lectin. In the case of pegylated Con A compositions, the compositions were taken from their reaction mixtures at a concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml (on a Con A reagent mass basis) and placed into equilibrium dialysis tubing (MW cut-off of 50 kD, Spectrapor brand, VWR Scientific, Bridgeport, N.J.). The solutions were extensively dialyzed against 100 mM BES buffer at pH 7 containing 1000 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MnCl2 to remove unreacted pegylation agent (100\ufffd volume turnover, dialysis buffer changed twice daily for 3 days), and then extensively against deionized water containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MnCl2 (100\ufffd volume turnover, dialysis buffer changed twice daily for 3 days). The resulting solutions were then lyophilized to yield essentially pure, pegylated Con A compositions., 28007=Lectins are highly specific carbohydrate-binding proteins. Lectins have been isolated from a variety of natural sources including seeds, roots, bark, fungi, bacteria, seaweed, sponges, mollusks, fish eggs, body fluids of invertebrates and lower vertebrates, and mammalian cell membranes (e.g., see The Lectins: Properties, Functions, and Applications in Biology and Medicine, Edited by Liener et al., Academic Press, 1986). A number of lectins have also been produced recombinantly (e.g., see Streicher and Sharon, Methods Enzymol. 363:47-77, 2003). As noted, lectins bind carbohydrates with a high degree of specificity. For example, some lectins will bind only to carbohydrates with mannose or glucose residues, while others only recognize carbohydrates that include galactose residues. Some lectins require that the particular residue be in a terminal position, while others bind to residues within a carbohydrate chain. Some lectins require specific anomeric structures and yet others recognize specific sugar sequences. The structures and properties of lectins have been extensively described in the literature.

PBMCs were incubated as described in Example 1 (i.e., three days, plus 18 hours) with a particular concentration of a lectin composition of interest (e.g., 0.01-1000 ug/ml). At the end of the incubation period, Trypan Blue (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was added to the culture. A representative sample of cells from the culture was then counted while noting those that either took up the trypan (i.e., those that were blue and thus dead) or still excluded the trypan (i.e., those that were not blue and thus alive). The % viability was calculated by dividing the number of cells that excluded the trypan (i.e., live cells) by the total number of cells counted (i.e., dead plus live cells)., 293341=This example demonstrates how inventive modified lectin compositions can be used in another type of glucose-responsive drug delivery system such as the one described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0202719 that makes use of native Con A and an insulin-dextran drug conjugate. In this example, the lectin is advantageously replaced with modified Con A composition P64 and the insulin-polysaccharide conjugate is replaced with an insulin-mannosylated-glycogen conjugate. However, the mechanism of glucose-responsive release remains essentially the same, i.e., a gel formed between the two components is eroded with glucose such that it releases the insulin-polysaccharide conjugate from the surface in a glucose-responsive manner. The release is controlled primarily by competitive binding and not by diffusion as described in Example 38., 146256=This example describes the preparation of pegylated Con A composition P44-4. P44-4 was prepared essentially as described in Ueno et al., Cancer Detection and Prevention 24:100-106, 2000 for the preparation of their \u201cPEG-Con A (High)\u201d except for the following minor variations. In particular, Ueno et al. used PEG2-CNS-10K as their reagent. This pegylation reagent is no longer commercially available, accordingly, we had to use PEG2-NHS-10K instead. This NHS reagent is much more hydrolytically stable than the CNC reagent used by Ueno et al., and hence a much lower PEG:Con A monomer molar ratio was required to achieve the same degree of pegylation as Ueno et al. The synthesis was carried out in a similar manner to Example 8, except that the for the changes that are described in Table 4., 110301=This example describes a method that was used to determine the cell agglutination properties of various lectin compositions. The minimum agglutinating concentrations (MAC) of each composition was determined in V-well microtitre plates using a 2% v/v suspension of formaldehyde-stabilized rabbit erythrocytes according to the procedure of Crowley et al., Methods. Enzymol. 83:368-373, 1982. Formaldehyde-treated rabbit erythrocytes, prepared by published procedures (Nowak et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 393:115-123, 1975), from rabbit blood obtained from University of Michigan Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, were available from previous studies. The MAC is defined as the lectin protein concentration (exclusive of attached chemical compounds such as PEG) in the highest dilution showing visible agglutination., 140134=Example 15 describes the preparation of a comparative pegylated Con A composition according to the teachings of Ueno et al., Cancer Detection and Prevention 24:100-106, 2000. This sample is referred to herein as P44-4 or the \u201cUeno sample.\u201d, 129788=This example describes the general procedure for establishing the glucose set point (GSP) curve for a glucose-regulated insulin delivery system comprising an insulin-polymer conjugate and a multivalent glucose binding molecule such as the modified lectin molecules present in the compositions of the invention (e.g., see Examples 39 and 41). Briefly, 1.0 ml of 1\ufffdPBS buffer containing 0 mg/dl of D-glucose is added to each of the 24 wells of a Multiwell\u2122 plate (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). An amount of the test delivery system is then added to the solution (in the form of a gel) and agitated for 1 hour using a microplate incubator/shaker (\u201cJitterbug,\u201d Boekel Industries, Philadelphia, Pa.) set at 37 C. After 1 hour, 0.5 ml of release medium is removed and the insulin-polymer concentration in the medium is determined by porcine insulin ELISA (ALPCO Diagnostics, Windham, N.H.). The remaining release medium is then supplemented with 0.5 ml of a 100 mg/dl glucose serum solution to make a 50 mg/dl solution, and the gels are agitated for another hour. Again 0.5 ml of release medium is then removed and the insulin-polymer concentration measured. This process is repeated for release media with glucose concentrations of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 3200 mg/dl for a total of 8 concentrations over 8 hours. The percent insulin-polymer dissolution at each glucose concentration is then calculated by normalizing the cumulative concentration of insulin-polymer in the release medium as measured by ELISA by that released at 100% gel dissolution. In all cases, 100% dissolution is obtained after the 3200 mg/dl glucose incubation. G10% and G50% are then determined by plotting cumulative release curves as a function of glucose concentration and estimating the glucose concentration at which 10% and 50% of the insulin-polymer is released., 82835=In some applications, it may be desirable to precipitate a chemically modified lectin with a polysaccharide. In order for precipitation to occur the lectin must be able to form multimers so that it can simultaneously bind more than one polysaccharide (i.e., one polysaccharide via each subunit in the multimer). We hypothesized that chemical modification of the lectins would potentially disrupt the degree of valency by preventing the formation of higher order multimers. Such a phenomenon has been observed for Con A chemically modified with succinyl groups (Gunther et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 70:1012-1016, 1973) or acetyl groups (Agrawal et al., Biochemistry 7:4211-4218, 1968). In order to overcome the potentially decreased ability to precipitate polysaccharides, in one embodiment it may prove advantageous to chemically crosslink the lectin subunits together to prevent dissociation after chemical modification and/or to create even higher valency structures. This type of crosslinking was described above in the context of multivalent chemical compounds and is further explored in Example 40., 263936=Anti-Con A IgG-class antibodies were assayed using a custom-made enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To each well of a 96-well microplate coated with Con A (Proteocell, Quebec, Calif.), 0.1 ml of serum, diluted by 1:1000 in 1\ufffd antibody conjugate solution, was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, after which each well of the plate was washed with 3\ufffd0.200 ml of wash buffer. 0.1 ml of 1\ufffd HRP-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody, diluted 1:10,000 from a commercially available anti-rat IgG kit (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, Tex.) was then added and the wells were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, after which the wells were emptied and washed four times with the kit wash buffer. After extensive washing, 0.1 ml of TMB substrate was added from the kit, and the wells were incubated for 10 minutes, after which 0.1 ml of 1\ufffd stop solution was added from the kit. The absorbance of each well of the plate was read at a wavelength of 450 nm using a 96-well UV VIS plate reader (SpectraMax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). The absorbance value (OD450) obtained for each serum sample was then used as a determinant for the concentration of anti-Con A IgG antibodies present in the sample., 68724=The number of chemical compounds that are attached to each lectin subunit (i.e., the degree of substitution) will vary based on the nature of the chemical compound or compounds, the number of reaction sites available and the reaction conditions. For example, the subunits of Con A each include twelve lysine residues. Thus if Con A is pegylated with an agent that reacts with lysine residues then each Con A subunit can be covalently linked to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 PEG molecules. Methods for determining the degree of substitution are discussed in the Examples and also in Delgado et al., Crit. Rev. Thera. Drug Carrier Sys. 9:249-304, 1992., 82024=In other embodiments the modified composition has a reduced glycogen precipitation value after removal despite being capable of binding analogous saccharides and polysaccharides. Preferably the glycogen precipitation value is less than 50% of the original mitogenic lectin composition value. More preferably the value is less than 75%, and yet preferably less than 90% of that value. The glycogen precipitation value can be ascertained using any known glycogen precipitation assay, e.g., see Goldstein et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 97:68-76, 1965. In preferred embodiments the glycogen precipitation value is ascertained by mixing compositions with glycogen solutions of varying concentration and measuring the absorbance at 490 nm as described in the Examples 7 and 27., 66657=Numerous methods for directly attaching PEGs to proteins are described in Delgado et al., Crit. Rev. Thera. Drug Carrier Sys. 9:249-304, 1992; Francis et al., Intern. J. of Hematol. 68:1-18, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 4,002,531; U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,052; WO 95/06058; and WO 98/32466. One such method uses tresylated monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG), which is produced by reacting MPEG with tresylchloride (ClSO2CH2CF3). Tresylated MPEG reacts with exposed amine groups on lectins. A skilled person will recognize that the invention is not limited to any specific pegylation agent (or chemical compound) and will be able to identify other suitable chemical compounds that are known in the art., 64709=Generally the chemical compounds may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. Preferably the chemical compounds have a molecular weight of about 1 to about 100 kD, more preferably 1 to 10 kD, for example about 1, 2, 5 or 10 kD. In the case of pegylation agents, the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kD and about 40 kD, preferably 1 to 10 kD. The chemical compound may have a branched structure. Branched PEGs are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,575; Morpurgo et al., Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 56:59-72, 1996; Vorobjev et al., Nucleosides Nucleotides 18:2745-2750, 1999; and Caliceti et al., Bioconjug. Chem. 10:638-646, 1999.}",

It can be seen from the SDS PAGE data that the higher degree of cyanogens bromide used with Batch B likely led to higher degrees of dextranylation of the Con A (compare lanes 4 and 5 of Figure EX 45-1). This likely explains why Batch B had the best mitogenicity profile as compared to Batch A and native Con A (see FIGS. 30 and 31 SDS PAGE and mitogenicity results for the dextranylated Con A batches can be found in Both Batch A and Batch B were purified extensively via ultrafitration using a 100 kD membrane using a stirred cell (Amicon, Millipore, Inc., Billerica, Mass.) against deionized water containing 1 mM MnCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2. After ten volume turnovers, the dextranylated-Con A solutions were lyophilized to obtain the purified dextranylated-Con A compositions. In a separate beaker, 400 mg of Type VI native Con A (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was dissolved in 40 ml of a pH 9.4, 100 mM sodium borate buffer. After all of",
