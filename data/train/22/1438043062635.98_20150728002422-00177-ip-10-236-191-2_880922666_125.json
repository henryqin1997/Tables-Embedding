            "SO MUCH TO DO!!",

            "It depends...I'm an out of state student, so Towson is a little expensive, however, they had an amazing speech pathology program and lots of clubs and activities, so for me it was worth the extra money.",
            "There are so so many clubs and activities. Towson is a bit of a party school, but if you don't like that atmosphere, there's so many other things to do on and around campus. You will not be bored.",
            "Towson has a LOT of options, which for me as a vegan, is great.",
            "My dorm has a private bathroom and air conditioning!! At Towson, you're not allowed to request what building you want as a freshman, but from what I've heard, everyone loves their building and has a lot of pride for it.",
            "This really depends on what classes you take and how many. Look up your teachers beforehand so you know what you're committing to.",
            "Get everything in as soon as possible, and use the facebook page to find a roommate (Towson Class of 20--) Trust me. It will feel good to know your acceptance status, roommate, and schedule when everyone else is panicking.",
            "Towson is a huge school. They have lots of options, academically and in extracurriculars. They've even got a rock wall and planetarium!"

Towson has their own Police department and they are very helpful if you need them. Between the hours of 2:30-6:30 Towson Police Department, or TUPD, offers a point to point campus transportation service called 'Safe Ride'., 7588=I would suggest taking a tour or visiting the campus before enrolling, that will really tell you if you belong. Also i would suggest going to the on campus events, at least for the first month. In September they have a month with things to do everyday. Freshman are given a carnival which is fun to go to for at least a little while. And although many freshman don't want to take part in the planned activities on their Dorm Floor i would suggest going. I had a lot of fun on my floor and is how i made my first friends., 42613=This campus is beautiful. Period. The construction that has been taking place on Towson University since 2008 have turn this campus from a historical landmark to the cutting edge of new architectures and pleasant environments. IN the fall, the campus comes to life with the colors of the changing season. In the winter, Towson transforms to a cool snowy paradise. In the spring and summer, Towson comes to life with activities and new and interesting people to meet. There is never a dull moment on this campus!, 111280=i hope soooo. im supposed to attend a tour on Oct.29th!, 304312=Towson looks like the perfect fit for me, im visiting the open house on october 20th, anyone else going?, 396948=Lot's of Greek Life on campus. I plan to pledge next September., 327168=Most of the dorm rooms at Towson are very large. They just opened a new dormitory and are opening another in the Fall of 2013. On another side of campus called West Village, there are dorms which are built to resemble Hotel style living. Whichever dorm you live in, your overall experience will depend on what you make it out to be., 63743=Towson offers small class sizes; usual student to faculty ratio is about 30:1. Most of the buildings are very close together, which makes for a (somewhat) easy trek between classes. It also offers helpful facilities for students to explore. As a business major, I would recommend Towson. Overall, teachers are encouraging, the CBE is AACSB accredited, but facilities (like parking and computers) are horrible.When in doubt, check out the school for yourself., 541132=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Bang for the buck I pay in-state tuition and i think its a reasonable price price for the quality of education. Am enjoying being here I love Towson and am very happy I chose this. Before I enrolled i took a tour and i knew this was the school i wanted to attend. When walking around there are always people",
