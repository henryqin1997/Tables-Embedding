The aforementioned selected node set 2027 serves as a set of explicit fragment references and is equivalent to the explicit fragment reference of 1127 in FIG. 12.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{130359=A first sub-step 1511 of the step 2026 evaluates the predicates. Then a step 1512 determines whether special attributes are to be added. Special attributes may be added when spatio-temporal axes, node-tests or functions are processed. If this is the case, then the process 1500 is directed by a \u201cYES\u201d arrow to a step 1513 that adds the special attribute. The process 1500 is then directed to a step 1514 that refines the selected node set. If a special attribute is not required, then the process 1500 is directed by a \u201cNO\u201d arrow from the step 1512 to the step 1514. The process 1500 is directed from the step 1514 back to the step 1304., 131993=In the step 1106, the \u201cmp\u201d Fragment Identifier Parser parses the following fragment identifier: mp(/CDAudio/Track[1]/\u02dctime(\u201830\u2019)) \u2003\u2003[58] The parsing operation produces the following location steps:, 71263=In the step 1006, the URI portion of the URI reference 1002 is used to locate a resource. The URI portion has the following form: (http://www.apxcom.com/products/dvd0111) \u2003\u2003[31], 103684=The step 1127, in a second step, effects the following: Obj={track=1, start_time=0}, 126418=After all the location steps 1110 have been processed, the final set of selected nodes 2027 is processed by the Content Processor 2035., 144663=The \u201cmp\u201d Fragment Evaluator 2015 provides a further advantage. The selected node set 2027 compiled by the evaluator 2015 can be output in XML form and examined. This enables the \u201cmp\u201d fragment identifier represented by the selected node set 2027 to be validated by checking that the intended fragments are to be selected from the resource 1104 without requiring the presence of the actual resource 1104. For instance, in the above example, the following XML representation of the final set of selected nodes 2027 can be used to verify that the initial \u201cmp\u201d fragment identifier [54B] actually does select the fragments that are intended to be retrieved: <Track type=\u201caudio\u201d number=\u201c1\u201d start_frame=\u201c0\u201d mp:start_time=\u201c30\u201d/>\u2003\u2003[63], 142494=After all the location steps 1110 have been evaluated, the following final set of selected nodes 2027, depicted in [62] is passed to the Content Processor 2035: (<Track type=\u201caudio\u201d start_frame=\u201c0\u201d mp:start_time=\u201c30\u201d/>) \u2003\u2003[62], 127916=A following step 1304 determines if any further location steps are available for processing. If this is the case, then a following step 1505 determines whether the location step currently being considered is the first location step. If so, then the process 1500 follows a \u201cYES\u201d arrow to a step 1502. The step 1502 determines if the root location step has a spatio-temporal axis. If so, then a subsequent step 1501 fetches a pre-defined XML model for the resource. The process 1500 is then directed back to the step 1304. If the step 1502 determines that the root location step does not has a spatio-temporal axis, then the process 1500 is directed from the step 1502 to a step 1503 which fetches meta-data for the resource in question. A following step 1504 builds a model for the resource from the meta-data and the URI obtained in the step 1301. The process 1500 is then directed back to the step 1304., 72273=Thereafter, a decision step 1022 determines whether the aforementioned steps have determined the last location step required to locate the desired resource fragment. If the last location step has been determined, the process 1000 is directed, according to a \u201cYES\u201d arrow 1024, to a step 1026 in which the located resource fragment is processed. The step 1026 is a post-location processing step., 144089=With this approach, complex XPath syntax and semantics are handled by the underlying XPath evaluator 2015. Extensions to the \u201cmp\u201d Audiovisual Addressing scheme only require incremental changes to the \u201cmp\u201d Fragment Evaluator 2015 by modifying the affected node-test step 2025 and predicate function step 2026 or implementing new node-test and predicate functions. While new logical models can be supported by adding code to construct the XML representation of the logical model in the step 2023., 113540=The step 1130 evaluates the effect of executing the relevant operations [53] to thereby update an explicit fragment reference. After all the location steps have been evaluated, each location step having the effect of updating the explicit fragment reference, the Content Processor 1135 is directed by the explicit fragment reference to call the operation PLAY_TRACK (1, 30) to play the required temporal fragment of track 1 of the CD., 103968=The process 1100 then returns to the step 1120. After all the location steps of 1110 have been processed, the process is directed by a \u201cNO\u201d arrow from the step 1120 to the content processing step 1135, which processes the desired content referenced by the explicit fragment reference 1127., 121554=Therefore in summary, the step 2023 provides the logical model 2040 for the resource 1104, this model being either pre-defined if the root location step is non-spatio-temporal, or inferred from the URI of the resource or from meta-data associated with the resource 1104 if the root location step is spatio-temporal., 121942=Thereafter, for each location step (apart from the first step) and in a manner similar to that used in a typical XPath evaluator, the evaluator 2015 projects, in a step 2024, the currently selected node set 2027 to the axis specified by the location step. Thereafter, a step 2025 evaluates the node test to select the nodes' projections on the new axis. For the present example [54A] the selected node set 2027 initially contains all <Track> elements. The step 2025 adds the Attribute start_time to the first track. Following the step 2025, the selected node set has been refined to a first <Track> element only. A following step 2026 evaluates the predicates one by one to refine the selected node set., 103826=The step 1127, in a third step, effects the following: Obj={track=1, start_time=30}, 112961=In the step 1125, the \u201cmp\u201d Fragment Evaluator 1115 maps the location steps CDAudio, Track[1] and \u02dctime(\u201830\u2019), respectively to the following operations:, 122758=In the case of spatio-temporal axes it is impractical to define the XML elements to the level required to represent discrete time units as well as pixels and voxels. In order to address this issue, the steps 2025 and 2026 which respectively perform spatio-temporal node-tests and predicate evaluations add special attributes to the selected node set 2027 of the XML model to provide the desired degree of resolution in the spatio-temporal dimensions., 131132=Returning to the step 1304, when no further location steps are available for processing, then the process 1500 is directed by a \u201cNO\u201d arrow to a step 1515 that processes the content according to the refined selected node set. The process 1500 then terminates at a step 1516., 118144=The URI reference 1102 includes the following \u201cmp\u201d fragment identifier: mp(/CDAudio/Track[1]/\u02dctime(\u201830\u2019)) \u2003\u2003[54B] which is used to retrieve a fragment of the audiovisual resource 1104. The URI reference 1100 (see [54A]) has the following URI part: um:aParticularAudioCD \u2003\u2003[54C] which is used to locate the resource 1104. The process 2000 has the \u201cmp\u201d Fragment Parser 1106 that parses the \u201cmp\u201d fragment identifier [54B] into the sequence of location steps 1110.}",
