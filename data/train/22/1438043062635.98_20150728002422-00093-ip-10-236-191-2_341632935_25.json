I will update as things are confirmed* Here\u2019s a sample of what my ideal (normal) gear setup would look like: Chardev profile \u2013 this would allow for the 4 set bonus and still retain 2005 haste. There is enough spirit on gear that I\u2019m not factoring it in to the priority, I\u2019ll just take it as it comes. The secondary stat priority I will be using for T12 is: Haste to 2005 > Mastery > Crit > extra Haste The only stat we have that is subject to caps or breakpoints is haste. If you are under 2005 haste, look for pieces with haste. If an ilvl upgrade will drop you below 2005 you may want to reconsider it. Does it have more Intellect (which comes with a higher ilvl)? Then it\u2019s likely an upgrade. I am not including a \u2018best in slot\u2019 list in this. I feel best in slot is a mostly meaningless term at this point. Which piece is best depends on what other gear you have, and with reforging most of it is interchangable anyways. When looking at upgrades look at: By Item Slot By Location 4.2 brings all kinds of new gear for resto druids, available from raids, valor points, rep vendors and some new crafted loot too.",
