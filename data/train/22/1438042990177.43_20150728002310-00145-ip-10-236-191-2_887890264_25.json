Instead of growing after a year of austerity, Greece\u2019s economy plunged into one of the worst recessions to ever hit a country in peacetime, with output falling 22 percent from 2008 to 2012., 79576=This isn\u2019t the first time Greece has been on the brink. Greece already holds the record for the biggest default ever by a country from 2012 when it went into technical default and had to restructure about $138 billion of its debt. Back then, Greece was quickly bailed out by its European peers. That\u2019s unlikely to happen now. The Greek government pulled its negotiators from talks with European officials Friday after little progress was made on a debt payment plan and economic reforms. Greece has called for a referendum vote on July 5 on the latest proposal from Europe and the International Monetary Fund., 178333=Before Greeks have voted on the measures demanded by creditors, \u201cwe will not negotiate about anything new at all,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. Her deputy and coalition partner, Sigmar Gabriel of the Social Democrats, urged Greece to cancel the referendum altogether. \u201cThen one could very quickly gather for talks, initial talks. If that\u2019s not the case, then we should certainly do this after the referendum,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said., 74417=WASHINGTON (Reuters) \u2013 As French Finance Minister in 2010, Christine Lagarde opposed the involvement of the International Monetary Fund in Greece., 55788=In December 2008, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa attempted to default on Ecuador\u2019s national debt, calling it illegitimate odious debt, because it was contracted by corrupt and despotic prior regimes.[10] He succeeded in reducing the price of the debt letters before continuing paying the debt.[11], 70530=While the IMF was worried about contagion when it made the loans, it also had institutional incentives for wanting to bail out troubled countries, said Andrea Montanino, a former IMF board member who left the Fund in 2014 after participating in reviews of Greece\u2019s second bailout in 2012., 66015=Against a backdrop of uncertainty, Tsipras has called a referendum on July 5 of the Greek people on whether to accept the bailout proposals\u2014and accompanying austerity measures\u2014proposed by creditors., 70073=The IMF\u2019s heavy involvement in large bailouts for euro zone countries, which included Ireland and Portugal, have enabled it to build up its reserve buffers in recent years. It is now aiming to store away some $28 billion by 2018., 85200=In choosing to bundle up four separate June repayments, Greece avoided triggering an immediate default., 105282=y to fall into arrears on payments to the fund.

While there are parallels between the two countries, experts say this potential Greek default could be much worse. \u201cThings are incredibly dire,\u201d says Anna Gelpern, a Georgetown University professor. \u201cFor political reasons and market-confidence reasons, they need to deal with the debt\u2026It\u2019s not clear to me how they deal with it without defaulting on anyone.\u201d, 165468=But markets bounced back Tuesday in Asia, and European indexes moved away from earlier losses after steep sell-offs in those regions helped push the Dow down 350 points in the prior session \u2014 its biggest one-day point loss since June 20, 2013., 57027=A 2002 article by economists Seema Jayachandran and Michael Kremer renewed interest in this topic.[7] They propose that the idea can be used to create a new type of economic sanction to block further borrowing by dictators.[8] Jayachandran proposed new recommendations in November 2010 at the 10th anniversary of the Jubilee movement at the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C.[9], 86872=With negotiations have broken off in dramatic fashion last week, a cacophony of voices on Syriza\u2019s Left have vowed to prioritise domestic obligations unless creditors finally unlock the remainder of its \u20ac240bn bail-out programme. Greece only avoided going bust earlier this month after the government has asked for a Zambia-style debt bundling which will now be due on June 30., 81727=In addition to the half a billion euros plus it owes the Fund this month, the Leftist government will still be paying back the IMF until 2030.

Greece \u2014 $138 billion, March 2012. Despite going into a technical default, the Greek government is propped up by bailout funds from its European peers. Those bailout funds eventually lead to the current dilemma. 2. Argentina \u2014 $95 billion, November 2001. Argentina\u2019s currency was \u201cpegged\u201d or equal to one U.S. dollar for years \u2014 a currency exchange that eventually proved to be completely inaccurate. Like Greece is doing this week, Argentina also clamped down on Argentines trying to take money out of the banks. It didn\u2019t help. The country\u2019s economy was nearly three times smaller just one year later, according to IMF data. In July 2014, Argentina went into a technical default after it missed a debt payment to its hold out creditors. 3. Jamaica \u2014 $7.9 billion, February 2010. Massive government overspending for years and rapid inflation pushed Jamaica into default five years ago. At the time, over 40% of the government\u2019s budget went to paying debts. Its economy, which depends on tourism, suffered when the U.S. recession began in late 2008. 4. Ecuador \u2014 $3.2 billion, December 2008. Ecuador pulled a fast one on its creditors. With a debt payment looming, the Ecuardor\u2019s government, led by President Rafael Correa, just said no to its creditors. He claimed the debt, some which was owned by American hedge funds, was \u201cimmoral.\u201d Rich in resources, Ecuardor could have made debt payments, but intentionally chose not to., 61191=The doctrine of odious debt was formalized in a 1927 treatise by Alexander Nahum Sack, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 legal theorist. It was based on two 19th century precedents\u2014Mexico\u2018s repudiation of debts incurred by Emperor Maximilian, and the denial by the United States of Cuban liability for debts incurred by the Spanish colonial regime.[2], 143901=Posted on June 30, 2015.

The International Monetary Fund generally gives countries a month after missing a debt payment before it declares a country in defaulted. However, the markets will most likely judge Greece to be in default by July 1. Greece\u2019s debt is spread out across the board. Greece owes money to the International Monetary Fund, Germany, France, Greek banks and several others. But consider this: Whatever happens to Greece, it\u2019s likely to be a long process. Argentina is still in default. But a key difference is that Greece has four times the debt load of Argentina \u2014 the next worst default \u2014 but Greece\u2019s economy is only half the size of Argentina\u2019s. While Greece would be the biggest sovereign default, Lehman Brothers had over $600 billion in assets when it filed for bankruptcy in 2008.

Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased., 191304=True, the federal deficit has fallen to about 4% of GDP this year from its 10% peak in 2009.

Separate funds belonging to Universa made returns of 65% to 115% in October 2008.[20][35] In the wake of the economic crisis that started in 2008, Taleb has become an activist for a \u201cblack swan robust society\u201d [36][37] and as of July 2011, Taleb is working with the International Monetary Fund on identifying and mitigating tail risks in financial markets.[17], 773837=What were the channels through which Swedish influence flowed to London and Washington? This is an especially interesting question because of the experience of the early 1930s, when Gustav Cassel argued without success that overly restrictive American monetary policy was making matters worse, and Gunnar Myrdal devised budgetary policies implemented by the new Social Democratic government in 1933 that spared Sweden the worst of the Great Depression., 762817=\u201c\u2026When Congress approved $700 billion for TARP, it was supposed to buy troubled mortgage securities from banks. The bill\u2019s language was broad, and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson decided in October he would use $250 billion to buy preferred stock in banks to bolster their capital. In late October, Paulson forced the nation\u2019s nine largest banks to accept a total of $125 billion, regardless of their health.[17] This was former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson\u2019s original vision for the TARP fund, but he switched course and decided to devote $250 billion to direct equity stake investments in banks before waffling again and heading back in the direction of asset purchases.[22] The Treasury has repeatedly said that TARP is not a bailout, and that it expects to eventually make money on the program. A study this month by the Congressional Budget Office found that, of the $247 billion the government had spent through Dec. 31, taxpayers were on the hook for about a quarter, or $64 billion. That amount represents the difference between what the Treasury paid for assets versus their market values. The Office of Management and Budget must submit semiannual reports on the costs of TARP, and the CBO must assess those reports.[1] Buying toxic assets was the original plan for government money until the Treasury shifted gears toward investments. \u201cThe first step has to be removing these toxic assets,\u201d Kaufman said. He sees the government buying up bad loans similar to the way the Resolution Trust Corp. bought distressed homes from savings and loans nearly two decades ago. Just as the RTC wound up costing taxpayers less than one-half the original estimates, the public could be on the hook for less than the full $700 billion this time, Kaufman said. Toxic-asset purchases can be tricky when it\u2019s hard to figure out a reasonable, fair price.[11] Parts of the discussion taking place within the government revolve around ways to leverage the remaining money in the TARP. The Fed already plans to use $20 billion from the TARP to set up a $200 billion program to support consumer and small business loans.[18], 758692=An economist specializing in financial markets gave a glimpse of the history of housing markets when he said: \u201cLending money to American homebuyers had been one of the least risky and most profitable businesses a bank could engage in for nearly a century.\u201d That was what the market was like before the government intervened. Like many government interventions, it began small and later grew. \u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026Under growing pressures from both the Clinton administration and later the George W. Bush administration, banks began to lower their lending standards. Mortgage loans with no down payment, no income verification and other \u201ccreative\u201d financial arrangements abounded. Although this was done under pressures begun in the name of the poor and minorities, people who were neither could also get these mortgage loans. With mortgage loans widely available to people with questionable prospects of being able to keep up the payments, it was an open invitation to financial disaster. Those who warned of the dangers had their warnings dismissed. Now, apparently, we need more politicians intervening in more industries, if you believe the politicians and the media. \u2026\u201d http://townhall.com/columnists/ThomasSowell/2009/02/18/upside_down_economics?page=2\u00a0 \u00a0, 374600=The late Berkeley statistician David Freedman said that efforts by statisticians to refute Taleb\u2019s stance have been unconvincing.[65] Taleb wrote in the second edition of The Black Swan that he had a session in 2008 with statisticians in which the hostility changed:, 285988=On May 12, 2011, when questioned by U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) at a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Exxon Mobil Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said that oil should cost between $60 and $70 per barrel, if the price of oil were based on supply and demand fundamentals.

J.W. Davis, Carolina First chairman, said his company discussed the TARP program extensively before exchanging equity for money with the federal government. He said a tight credit market makes it difficult to raise capital, and the TARP program was an efficient and low-cost solution.[19] \u201cI am convinced that our bank and many, many others are lending more than we would have if we hadn\u2019t taken the TARP money, says Ken Wilcox, chief executive of SVB Financial, which operates Silicon Valley Bank in Palo Alto. Wilcox says his bank, which caters to startup and publicly held technology companies, was able to raise several billion in new deposits since it took $235 million in TARP funds in early December.[17] We\u2019ve also in the interbank market we have had on average $40 billion or $50 billion out and into bank market, that is also a form of lending. All of this is helped by the TARP so we think it\u2019s a valid question people to ask what are doing with the TARP money and we do say its hard to separate exactly what is TARP money because remember we\u2019re making loans all the time but we are trying to follow the intent and spirit of TARP which is to help the economy of the United States recover and make sure we\u2019re financing people.[27], 351289=Both sides of his family were politically prominent in the Lebanese Greek Orthodox community. On his mother\u2019s side, his grandfather, Fouad Nicolas Ghosn, and his great-grandfather, Nicolas Ghosn, were both deputy prime ministers.

Keynes, Keynes, nation debt, saving, Socialism, Spending, Taxes |, 689104=\u201c\u2026It is commonly argued that World War II provided the stimulus that brought the American economy out of the Great Depression. The number of unemployed workers declined by 7,050,000 between 1940 and 1943, but the number in military service rose by 8,590,000. The reduction in unemployment can be explained by the draft, not by the economic recovery. The rise in real GNP presents similar problems. Most estimates show declines in real consumption spending, which means that consumers were worse off during the war. Business investment fell during the war. Government spending on the war effort exceeded the expansion in real GNP. These figures are suspect, however, because we know that government estimates of the value of munitions spending, to name one major area, were increasingly exaggerated as the war progressed. In fact, the extensive price controls, rationing, and government control of production render data on GNP, consumption, investment, and the price level less meaningful. How can we establish a consistent price index when government mandates eliminated the production of most consumer durable goods? What does the price of, say, gasoline mean when it is arbitrarily held at a low level and gasoline purchases are rationed to address the shortage created by the price controls? What does the price of new tires mean when no new tires are produced for consumers?

Real gross national product increased every year, consumer prices were stable (as measured by the consumer price index), real wages rose as a consequence of productivity advance, stock prices tripled. Automobile production in 1929 was almost precisely double the level of 1922.

This stance has attracted criticism: the American Statistical Association devoted the August 2007 issue of The American Statistician to The Black Swan. The magazine offered a mixture of praise and criticism for Taleb\u2019s main points, with a focus on Taleb\u2019s writing style and his representation of the statistical literature. Robert Lund, a mathematics professor at Clemson University, writes that in Black Swan, Taleb is \u201creckless at times and subject to grandiose overstatements; the professional statistician will find the book ubiquitously naive.\u201d[60], 680178=\u201c\u2026Federal spending was cut from $6.3\u00a0billion in 1920 to $5\u00a0billion in 1921 and $3.2\u00a0billion in 1922.

In all the others it increases to between 77% and 190% of GDP.

It is not that Misesian theory was refuted successfully; it was just forgotten in the rush to climb on the suddenly fashionable Keynesian bandwagon. Some of the leading adherents of the Mises theory \u2013 who clearly knew better \u2013 succumbed to the newly established winds of doctrine, and won leading American university posts as a consequence., 194802=\u201cIf those changes came entirely from revenues, they would represent an increase of 11 percent relative to the amount of revenues projected for the 2014-2038 period; if the changes came entirely from spending, they would represent a cut of 10\u00bd percent in noninterest spending from the amount projected for that period.\u201d, 253645=Peter Schiff interviews Marc Faber on Schiffradio Oct 2012\u00a0, 200299=Applied nationally, assuming Treasury goes explicit in its default in the way it\u2019s long been implicit (the dollar that Treasuries pay out bought 1/35th of an ounce of gold in 1971, yet today it buys roughly 1/1300th) in its stiffing of creditors, is it really a certainty that Armageddon awaits as Ferguson presumes? Or is it more likely that investors, burned by Treasury, will migrate away from U.S. debt, along with government debt more broadly?, 254281=When the United States stopped backing dollars with gold in 1968, the nature of money changed. All previous constraints on money and credit creation were removed and a new economic paradigm took shape. Economic growth ceased to be driven by capital accumulation and investment as it had been since before the Industrial Revolution. Instead, credit creation and consumption began to drive the economic dynamic. In The New Depression: The Breakdown of the Paper Money Economy, Richard Duncan introduces an analytical framework, The Quantity Theory of Credit, that explains all aspects of the calamity now unfolding: its causes, the rationale for the government\u2019s policy response to the crisis, what is likely to happen next, and how those developments will affect asset prices and investment portfolios., 197004=Back in 2008 in the lead-up to the 2008 presidential elections, John Stewart\u2019s Comedy Channel show did a feature on John McCain going back to 1980.

Ludwig von Mises, alone armed with a correct theory of the business cycle, was one of the very few economists to predict the Great Depression, and hence the economic world was forced to listen to him with respect. F. A. Hayek spread the word in England, and the younger English economists were all, in the early 1930s, beginning to adopt the Misesian cycle theory for their analysis of the depression \u2013 and also to adopt, of course, the strictly free-market policy prescription that flowed with this theory. Unfortunately, economists have now adopted the historical notion of Lord Keynes: That no \u201cclassical economists\u201d had a theory of the business cycle until Keynes came along in 1936. There was a theory of the depression; it was the classical economic tradition; its prescription was strict hard money and laissez-faire; and it was rapidly being adopted, in England and even in the United States, as the accepted theory of the business cycle. (A particular irony is that the major \u201cAustrian\u201d proponent in the United States in the early and mid-1930s was none other than Professor Alvin Hansen, very soon to make his mark as the outstanding Keynesian disciple in this country.), 687876=\u201c\u2026A worldwide depression struck countries with market economies at the end of the 1920s. Although the Great Depression was relatively mild in some countries, it was severe in others, particularly in the United States, where, at its nadir in 1933, 25 percent of all workers and 37 percent of all nonfarm workers were completely out of work. Some people starved; many others lost their farms and homes. Homeless vagabonds sneaked aboard the freight trains that crossed the nation. Dispossessed cotton farmers, the \u201cOkies,\u201d stuffed their possessions into dilapidated Model Ts and migrated to California in the false hope that the posters about plentiful jobs were true. Although the U.S. economy began to recover in the second quarter of 1933, the recovery largely stalled for most of 1934 and 1935. A more vigorous recovery commenced in late 1935 and continued into 1937, when a new depression occurred. The American economy had yet to fully recover from the Great Depression when the United States was drawn into World War II in December 1941. Because of this agonizingly slow recovery, the entire decade of the 1930s in the United States is often referred to as the Great Depression. \u2026\u201d, 530300=In his 2006 video \u201cReel Bad Arabs\u201d he explores the vilification of Arabs in American cinema, following Jack Shaheen\u2019s 2001 book Reel Bad Arabs., 208691=Posted on March 5, 2013.

Throughout the Great Depression, there was little information on the extent of unemployment in the country. More important, there was no good way to assess whether the situation was getting better or worse.
