Such screen is displayed upon selection of the New button of FIG. 13 or the New Rule icon of FIGS. 9 and 10. The user can select a destination from the icon box 1402 or can enter one in the destination entry field 1404. The user then selects the Next button 1406. The user then selects the time and days of the week that the rule is in effect (or not in effect) on the screen 1500 of FIG. 15 and selects the Next button 1502. The screen 1600 of FIG. 16 is displayed. Here, the user selects the mechanism that enforces the rule from the facility field 1602, enters the port number (optionally) and selects the transport protocol. The user then selects the Next button., 143925=FIGS. 21-23 illustrate screens for editing a network object. The screen 2100 of FIG. 21 displays the selected network object. FIG. 22 depicts a screen 2200 that allows selection of the other network object(s) that will be associated with the object shown in FIG. 21. FIG. 23 illustrates a screen 2300 that allows creation of the relationship between the selected network objects, here an and/or relationship., 140284=FIG. 10 illustrates a screen 1000 that allows a user to create associations of rule sets and objects. As shown, the user selects a particular firewall icon and icons 1002 representing network objects or groups of network objects are displayed. Each icon representing a group of objects should be denoted in some manner. Here, such icons representing a group of objects are denoted by a check mark. Again, right clicking on an object icon displays a menu 1004., 140784=FIG. 11 depicts a screen 1100 displayed upon selection of a network object, such as by selecting the \u201cProperties\u201d or \u201cEdit\u201d item of a menu of the icon representing the network object. See FIG. 10. The screen displays the object or objects represented by the object icon. Upon selection of the OK button 1104, changes are saved. Selecting the Cancel button 1106 exits the screen without saving changes. It should be noted that selection of the OK and Cancel buttons on other screens shown in Figures herein operate in a similar manner. FIG. 12 shows a screen 1200 displayed upon selection of the rules tab 1102 of FIG. 11. From here, rules relating to the particular object(s) can be edited., 143534=FIGS. 19 and 20 illustrate screens for adding a network object. FIG. 19 illustrates a screen 1900 for selecting a type of the network object. The object type is selected and the Next button is selected to display the user group screen 2000, shown in FIG. 20. Upon selection of the user group, the Finish button is selected to save the network object., 116560=In Addition to Example 1 Some Inside Machines Need Access to SQL and Port 1111/TCP, 141543=FIG. 13 illustrates a screen 1300 for creating and editing rule sets. As shown, the destination, time limits, protocol (port), facility, configuration, and rule action of each rule in the rule set are displayed. The action of a particular rule can be represented by an icon. Here, a stop icon 1302 represents a deny action. An icon 1304 with a question mark represents a conditional deny action. A smiling icon 1306 represents a permit action. By selecting the New button 1308, the user can add new rules. Upon selecting a rule, such as by clicking on a line, and pressing the edit button 1310, the user is allowed to edit the parameters of the rule., 143104=FIG. 17 depicts a screen 1700 that allows selection of an action for the rule. Upon selection of the desired rule action, the Next button is selected. The user is allowed to select a protocol configuration on the screen 1800 shown in FIG. 18. Upon making the selection, the user selects the Finish button 1802 and the rule is added to the rule set or the edits are made to the rule.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents. allows imposition of a global mode of the firewall operation in a single step by supporting the global source network object. allows easy policy amendment for a single object (user, IP address) which previously had no policy of its own supports the notion of the intersecting network objects (e.g. a user belongs to more than one user group) and allows determination of a policy for the elements in the intersecting subset supports defining policies based on the source user name and IP addresses, destination IP addresses or DNS names, and the network protocols allows for a simple \u201cdrag-and-drop\u201d user interface policy rule sets could be unambiguously merged allowing a smaller and more manageable set of the basic policies policy rule specification is separated from the network objects specification allowing a modular way of creating network policies Accordingly, the present network policy management model combines the familiar rule-based policy specification with the advanced network topology based policy representation. Simple policy rules syntax and semantics hide the complexity of the policy specification from the Administrator by aggregating policy fragments",
