            "I always feel very safe walking around campus by myself, even at night.",
            "SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES! There is basically a club for everyone and if there isn't a club you're interested in, it is easy to make one!",
            "Cortaca! The big football game between Cortland and rival Ithaca. Such a fun day.",
            "SUNY Cortland is a very athletic school, and even if you are not on a sports team, everyone is always at the games and it is such an exciting feeling. There are choirs and a theater program, A LOT of intramural and club sports, there really is a place for everyone.",
            "There is so much food here! So many options also. I never really got tired of eating on campus because I could always switch it up.",
            "The dorm I lived in was newly re-done so it was VERY nice. The RA's were all very nice and helpful also.",
            "The work load here (depending on your major) is very reasonable, I personally have not had one of those nights where I am up until 4am doing work. There is enough to keep you busy but usually not too overwhelming.",
            "Try to arrange an overnight if you can. It's a great way to really get the feel of what living in a dorm room and experiencing all the aspects of the school are like. Also, take advantage of what your school offers, college is the time to get involved.",
            "SUNY Cortland is an excellent school. The professors are really helpful and want to see you excel. There are so many ways to get involved on campus too, it's great!"

We attend fashion shows, plays, movie nights in town. We had a formal night where we got dressed up and had fun. Our football team is the Red Dragons. In mid-November, I experienced the big game of the year between our Red Dragons and Ithaca Bombers. The game is called Cortaca. We travelled to Ithaca and experienced the rivalry football game. There are also many different events held in dorms by the resident assistants. There are many things to do on campus such as sports and plays as well as many things to do off campus also. It is just a matter of finding them and having people to go with when you do., 109730=The famous Cortaca jug is a football game against our rivals Ithaca College every November. There is always so much school spirit on game day., 138305=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I would suggest not buying the books from the school store. I have bought all my books there, and they are overpriced and don't have a good buyback price. A lot of money is wasted on books and I would suggest buying or renting books from an online source. Bang for the buck The meal plans are nice, however they are very expensive and sometimes not the most flexible. The meals from each week roll over, but only 2 of them can be used the next week. What ends up happening is all the meals roll over but by the end of the semester they can't all be used, so the meals are wasted. Am enjoying being here The campus is very inviting. The people are for the most part friendly, especially the ASC staff. The people who work in Corey are some of the nicest people I have ever met. I have made many great friends here who I will keep in touch with for the rest of my life. Am learning a lot I am currently a junior on campus and a Speech/Hearing major. I feel that it is one of the hardest majors here at",
