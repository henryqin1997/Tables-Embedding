Bugged out has a reputation for being one of the most cutting edge clubs in the world and with the likes of Dave Clarke, Green Velvet, Armand Van Helden and Roger Sanchez playing this summer. The edge is slightly blunted in August when Fatboy Slim joins the Skint lot for a party, still we can forgive them for that.}",

Having firmly established itself as one of the biggest clubs to have come out of the UK, Ministry's Ibiza residency provides that home from home regularity some holiday makers need. What a top summer season they have lined up too, with the Americans really pressing for prominence in Ibiza this year. There is a Azuli Records Party, a Strictly Rhythm Party and an oh so cool Subliminal Records Party to finish off the summer. Renaissance Renaissance in the UK are most notable for their hallmark of quality and excellence in everything they do. When they pack up their super stylish holiday trunks and head off to the Balearics they don't forget to pack the style. This year they return to Pacha with a line up of DJ's and a club deck out worthy of being titled a 'Masterpiece'. Cream Scouse house masters head off to the Balearics for their sixth consecutive year. Highlight of the year for Cream this year must be the booking",
