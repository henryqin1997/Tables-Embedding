            "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTHORING AND LEARNING - Provided is a training method comprising delivering a situation to a learner, the situation comprising an event; automatically inserting a still menu in order to simulate a pause in the delivering; while pausing, recording an action by the learner in response to the event; reviewing the action recorded by the learner; and presenting to the learner a preferred action by a master in response to the event. Also provided is an authoring method comprising recording a situation comprising an event; further recording a master preferred action in response to the event; creating a program comprising motion menus and still menus where the situation, event, and master preferred action are placed on motion menus and still menus; and arranging the program and recordings so that the program carries out the following: delivering the recorded situation to the learner; automatically inserting a still menu after completing the play of a motion menu in order to simulate a pause in the delivering; recording the learner's action in response to the event; reviewing the learner's action; and presenting the learner with the master preferred action. An authoring and learning system is also provided, the system comprising a master video recording tool; a program comprising at least two motion menus and at least two still menus; a learner video delivery tool; a delivery medium; a learner video recording tool; and a learner control. The system may further comprise a program wherein the program gives an author flexibility to set up videos on alternating motion menus, and still menus and integrated recording and reviewing functions among the alternating menus, and wherein the program gives a learner some interactive control over the alternating menus and recording and reviewing functions.",
            "METHOD FOR INTERACTIVE LEARNING AND TRAINING - Provided is a method comprising delivering a video of an event to a learner that includes a still menu that effectuates and simulates a pause; recording a video of an action by the learner in response to the event; presenting to the learner the video of the action by the learner; presenting to the learner a video showing a preferred action by a master in response to the event; and recording at least one additional action by the learner. Also provided is a method for teaching a learner how to respond to an event comprising allowing the learner to choose among recording an action in response to a video of an event, viewing one or more recorded actions of a master, and comparing the two videos; wherein recording may be chosen before and after either or both viewing and reviewing, and the recordings are viewable as videos on a monitor."

The combination provides good release of the drug in use, reduces loss of the drug during a drying step in manufacture, reduces chemical interaction of the layer with the drug and achieves low level of skin irritation. 20100087768 Published Description Patent application number Paula Forlano, Buenos Aires AR 09-15-2011 COMBINE USE OF PTEROSTILBENE AND QUERCETIN FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CANCER TREATMENT MEDICAMENTS - The invention relates to the combined use of pterostilbene and quercetin for the production of cancer treatment medicaments. The in vitro growth of melanoma cells B16-F10 (B16M-F10) is inhibited (56%) by combined exposures of short duration (60 min/day) to PTER (40 \u03bcM)+QUER (20 \u03bcM) (\u02dcaverage values of plasma concentrations measured within the first hour following the IV administration of 20 mg of each polyphenol/kg \u02dc).

The stencil includes a front and rear side and a plurality of cutouts therethrough. The cutouts on the stencil form various bingo formations that are commonly played. The rear side of the stencil includes a pocket that is adapted to hold a bingo game board therein. The pocket is constructed to hold the bingo game board securely, thereby eliminating the need for additional fasteners. In use, a bingo game board is placed behind the stencil and inserted into the pocket so that the numbers disposed on the board are shown through the cutouts. The stencil allows users to see the numbers that are shown through the cutouts while blocking the rest of the numbers from view. In this way, the present invention assists users in identifying numbers on a bingo game board that form a winning bingo formation. 02-05-2015 Paula Fristoe, Redding, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20130327901 CANNULA SUPPORT - The cannula support includes",
