    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{17813=Survey participants, ages 6 to 79 years of age, were eligible for the Spirometry Component. Specific exclusion criteria that were employed for Baseline Spirometry included criteria employed in earlier NHANES Spirometry surveys. Excluded from testing were examinees that had current chest pain or a physical problem with forceful expiration, were taking supplemental oxygen, had recent surgery of the eye, chest or the abdomen; had a recent heart attack, stroke, tuberculosis exposure or had recently coughed up blood. Adults with a personal history of detached retina or a collapsed lung and children with painful ear infections were also excluded. In the NHANES 2007-8, Baseline (1st test) Spirometry data was collected for 6,444 sample persons., 21072=Spirometry, which means \u201cthe measuring of breath,\u201d is a routinely used clinical pulmonary function test. It measures the amount and speed of air that a person can exhale after taking in the deepest possible breath. This allows estimates for lung volume and air flow rates to be made. Results from Spirometry testing are one key element (among others) needed to diagnose respiratory disorders such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These diseases are typically characterized by a reduction in expiratory air flow rates. This is defined in spirometry as a reduction in the ratio of the expiratory volume measured in the 1st second of a forceful exhalation (FEV1) to the total volume of air exhaled in the forced expiration (FVC), the FVC being an estimate of the individual's effective lung volume. The \"Spirometric Measurements Section\" of the NHANES 2007-8 Respiratory Health Spirometry Procedures Manual contains a basic explanation of interpreting spirometry data. The manual is available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_07_08/spirometry.pdf, 19889=Spirometry is one of two NHANES 2007-8 components on respiratory health sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institute of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Health Statistics and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Individual Exhaled Nitrous Oxide (ENO), a marker of airways inflammation, is also measured. The objective of the Spirometry data collection is to provide health examination data to estimate the current prevalence of asthma and COPD in the U.S. population. The data is also intended to help produce updated spirometric reference data for the U.S. National-level Spirometry data was collected in NHANES I (1971-1975), NHANES II (1976-1980) and most recently in NHANES III (1988-1994). Comparisons of the current data with that from previous studies will help to identify trends in respiratory conditions over time., 12464=Spirometry testing for an individual continued until he/she was able to achieve a reproducible spirogram, or until a maximum of eight spirometry curves had been obtained, or until the participant could not continue. The overall goal was for the participant to achieve three acceptable exhalation maneuvers by ATS criteria in which the two highest values for the FVC and the FEV1 (each taken from an acceptable forced expiratory maneuver) showed minimal variability: i.e. the two largest FVC values taken from 2 acceptable curves should agree within 150 ml, and similarly for the two largest values for the FEV1. The procedure for the Bronchodilator (2nd Test) Spirometry, performed after the participant had taken the \u03b22-adrenergic bronchodilator albuterol, was identical to the procedure for the Baseline 1st test. Please refer to the NHANES 2007-8 Repiratory Health Spirometry Procedure manual for full details on the testing protocol, and for detailed criteria for a reproducible spirogram., 6838=For those who want to perform analytic studies using data that excludes subjects that may not have perfect data, they should simply use data only with FEV1 and FVC quality grades A and B. Grade C indicates less than a perfect test, for example instances where there are only 2 acceptable curves achieved but where the data most likely represents a value where the subject made a maximal effort. Generally data with quality grades D and F are not used for data analysis. In the NHANES 2007-8 data collection 87% of summary best-test FVC estimates were of quality A or B, and 94% were of quality A, B, or C. For FEV1, 91% of summary best-test FVC estimates were of quality A or B, and 96% were of quality A, B, or C. When assessing data results, analysts may also want to take into consideration whether an examinee had a history of a recent respiratory illness such as a cold, which could potentially cause transient changes in spirometric values. The questionnaire variable ENQ100 captures a participant\u2019s history of a recent respiratory illness., 22019=Title: Spirometry - 1st Test & 2nd Test Bronchodilator Studies (SPX_E ) Contact Number: 1-866-441-NCHS Years of Content: 2007 - 2008 First Published: December, 2011 Revised: NA Access Constraints: None Use Constraints: None Geographic Coverage: National Subject:Spirometry and Bronchodilator examination component, NHANES 2007-08 survey.

Record Source: NHANES 2007 - 2008 Survey Methodology: NHANES 2007 - 2008 is a stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the U.S. Medium: NHANES Web site; SAS transport files, 14149=Testing procedures met the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) (Miller, Hankinson, Brusasco el al. 2005). The protocol was similar to that used in NHANES III (1998-1994), with the minor change in the goal for the number of acceptable quality spirometry maneuvers, from five in NHANES III, to three in NHANES 2007-8. Also, to ensure data comparability between NHANES survey cycles, the same spirometers that were employed for the NHANES III spirometry examination (1988-1994) were used for NHANES 2007-8 data collection. These were Ohio 822/827 dry-rolling seal volume spirometers. The devices were reconditioned for use in the current survey and were maintained by the NIOSH laboratories. In NHANES 2007-8, unlike NHANES III, a new in-line biological filter (A-M Systems PFT Filter Kit B) was fitted to each spirometry hose to minimize infection risks to the participant., 3842=Sample Weights: The NHANES examination sample weights, i.e. the full sample 2-Year MEC Exam Weight (WTMEC2YR) should be used to analyze the 2007-8 spirometry data. Please refer to the NHANES Analytic Guidelines (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/survey_methods.htm) and the on-line NHANES Tutorial (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues., 10862=The Respiratory Health Spirometry Procedures Manual provides detailed descriptions of the quality assurance and quality control measures that were used for the NHANES 2007-8 Spirometry examination. The Chief Health Technician at each MEC monitored ongoing staff performance in the field. Health technician performance was also monitored using direct observation at periodic site visits by NIOSH consultants and project officers from Westat (the data collection contractor) and NHANES. Spirometry equipment was kept in calibration via regularly scheduled quality control checks by the Health Technicians and these were verified by supervisory staff., 3261=Additional 2007-8 NHANES Data on Respiratory Health: The raw data for the spirometry curves attempted by each participant in the NHANES 2007-8 Spirometry Component is released in a separate dataset (SPXRAW_E). The raw data permits users to graph a participant's spirometry test curves. It is also intended for the use of data analysts who may want to perform more advanced modeling studies with the raw data. The NHANES 2007-8 Respiratory Health Component also included testing for Exhaled Nitric Oxide (ENX_E), and Household Inteview Questionaire data on a prior diagnosis of asthma and COPD (MCQ_E), recent respiratory symptoms such as cough and wheezing (RDQ_E), data for the participant's current prescription medications (RXQ_RX_E; RXQ_DRUG), and data for occupational risk factors for COPD (OCQ_E).}",
