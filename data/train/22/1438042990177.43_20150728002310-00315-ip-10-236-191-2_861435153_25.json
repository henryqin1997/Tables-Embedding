The magazine, which is based in Arlington, Texas, USA, was founded in January 1997 by Gary Slade, Virgil E. Moore III, and Rick Tidrow.[1] In 1997, Amusement Today won the Impact Award in the services category for \"Best New Product\" from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA). A year later, in 1998, the magazine founded the Golden Ticket Awards, which it is most known for today. On January 2, 2001, Slade bought out his two partners, giving him sole ownership of the paper.[1] The paper has two full-time and two part-time staff members at its Arlington office, along with two full-time writers and several freelance writers in various parts of the world., 8229=Every year, Amusement Today gives out awards to the best of the best in the amusement park industry in a ceremony known as the Golden Ticket Awards. The awards are handed out based on surveys given to experienced and well-traveled amusement park enthusiasts from around the world. The awards, which were first handed out in 1998, have been featured on the Discovery Channel and the Travel Channel. Despite the magazine's attempts to prevent bias by separating surveys into balanced geographical regions, some claim the awards are biased towards American parks and roller coasters due to the use of a \"total point system\" to calculate the award winners. Using the total point system, the awards usually favor a park or ride that more voters have visited, regardless of quality[2]}",
