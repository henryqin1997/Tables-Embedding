Bianchi, A. D. Stefano, C. Giaconia, L. Scalia, G. Terrazzino, and I. Tinnirello, \u201cExperimental assessment of the backoff behavior of commercial ieee 802.11b network cards,\u201d in INFOCOM. IEEE, 2007, pp. 1181\u20131189. that the tx antenna diversity is the primary cause of the bi-modal distribution. According to this paper, the madwifi transmit diversity algorithm appears to cyclically (periodically) switch between the two antennas in the case of broadcast and multicast because the transmitter cannot obtain feedbacks from the receivers. In case of unicast, the transmitter utilizes the feedbacks from the receivers (ACKs) to determine which antenna to use., 14634=I used the RSSI measurements from the first field experiement on Oct 20th, 2009 and the RSSI measurements on mesh testbed with the insertion loss=40dB to for my first attempt to calibrate the RF switch.}",
