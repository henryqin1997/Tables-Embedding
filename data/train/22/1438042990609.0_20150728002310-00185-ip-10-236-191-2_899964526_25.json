For institutions requiring multiple-question MFA, respond with again for each initial question and tomato for the final question.

All passwords except for plaid_good and plaid_locked will return as invalid. In certain cases, depending on the Financial Institution, you might be required to submit additional information in the credentials object such as a PIN number.

In general, 200 HTTP codes respond to success, 40X codes are for client-related failures, and 50X codes are for Plaid-related issues. We're doing our best to maximize the former and diminish the latter; however, if you find consistent issues, please contact support immediately. For a full list of response codes, see response code detail below or visit our GitHub support page. HTTP Code Type Details 400 1000 access_token missing You need to include the access_token that you received from the original submit call. 400 1001 type missing You need to include a type parameter. Ex. bofa, wells, amex, chase, citi, etc. 400 1003 access_token disallowed You included an access_token on a submit call - this is only allowed on step and get routes. 400 1008 unsupported access_token This access token format is no longer supported. Contact support to resolve. 400 1004 invalid options format Options need to be JSON or stringified JSON. 400 1005 credentials missing Provide username, password, and pin if appropriate.",
