I like it very much for my first semester was in the fall 2013 I loved it. And the teachers help you the most in everything. Small classes, 182385=Hispanics are known for being bad at school, and that usually means the generations of teachers could get worse each year. It has been deemed official in the media: http://www.abqjournal.com/151312/north/higher-teacher-standards-urged.html Highlands had the lowest outcomes by nearly every measure in the report. Highlands had the largest proportion of the bottom third. I wonder what could be wrong here...?, 11021=Go along with the drama. Check out our confessions page. It really shows how trashy everyone here really is. https://www.facebook.com/nmhuofficialconfessions2013, 104924=Books being thrown at students and sh*t: http://www.koat.com/news/new-mexico-highlands-professor-throws-book-at-disabled-student/25582918, 74802=Las Vegas is the murder capital of New Mexico since 2011: http://lvdailytimes.com/2012/11/01/las-vegas-becomes-the-murder-capital-of-new-mexico-according-to-fbi-report-sociologists-point-to-economy.aspx Crime Rates in this town: http://www.city-data.com/crime/crime-Las-Vegas-New-Mexico.html, 139144=Former Head of NMHU Public Relations Office Found Dead http://www.abqjournal.com/8020/abqnewsseeker/former-head-of-nmhu-public-relations-office-found-dead.html https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2011/apr/06/bc-nm-woman-killed/, 54917=Teachers who graduate from this school have students with lower test scores than statistically expected. http://www.abqjournal.com/151401/north/higher-teacher-standards-urged.html http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=34xna7o&s=5#.UnWBWPmkrG8, 123880=It looks big but its actually a small school thats spread out. The classes are small so you can have your one on one time with your teacher, they know you by your name not just a number. I loved it & planning on attending in Fall 2012, 137365=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GMP3b_HWOI A college student was tricked into prostitution her first year at NMHU by football players when she was still 17. Dean of Students, Fidel Trujillo at New Mexico Highlands University made a sexual assault/rape and domestic violence victim delete a recording of a witness testifying to a prostitution ring targeting mostly underage freshman on campus. The ring was run by the football players who were accused of gang rape in 2011, so the Dean wanted to silence her before this reaches the public. She had the video backed up and here it is. The university is not doing anything about it so she needs her voice to be heard elsewhere. Please share this video to show what exactly the university is trying to cover up. If more people help spread this around the internet, eventually something will get done., 163317=KNOW YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS! The NMHU administrators, specifically Fidel Trujillo expects students to not know anything and unlawfully punishes students without proper due process and also punishes for freedom of speech. Here are some case laws to show what he can and can't do if he tries anything with you: Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 1 Cranch 137 137 (1803) It is also not entirely unworthy of observation that, in declaring what shall be the supreme law of the land, the Constitution itself is first mentioned, and not the laws of the United States generally, but those only which shall be made in pursuance of the Constitution, have that rank. Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written Constitutions, that a law repugnant to the Constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument. U.S. v. Lee,106 U.S. 196, 220 1 S. Ct. 240, 261, 27 L. Ed 171 (1882) No man in this country is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the law may set that law at defiance, with impunity. All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law are bound to obey it. It is the only supreme power in our system of government, and every man who, by accepting office participates in its functions, is only the more strongly bound to submit to that supremacy, and to observe the limitations which it imposes on the exercise of the authority which it gives.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? Downs v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244 (1901) It will be an evil day for American Liberty if the theory of a government outside supreme law finds lodgement in our constitutional jurisprudence. No higher duty rests upon this Court than to exert its full authority to prevent all violations of the principles of the Constitution. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 426, 491; 86 S. Ct. 1603 Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?rule making\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? or legislation which would abrogate them. Norton v. Shelby County, 118 U.S. 425 p. 442 An unconstitutional act is not law; it confers no rights; it imposes no duties; affords no protection; it creates no office; it is in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed. Sherar v. Cullen, 481 F. 2d 946 (1973) There can be no sanction or penalty imposed upon one because of his exercise of constitutional rights. Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377 (1968) The claim and exercise of a Constitution right cannot be converted into a crime\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2\u00a6 a denial of them would be a denial of due process of law. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights. It merely says, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? But a catalogue of these rights includes customary, traditional, and time-honored rights, amenities, privileges, and immunities that come within the sweep of \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?the Blessings of Liberty\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? mentioned in the preamble to the Constitution. Many of them, in my view, come [410 U.S. 211] within the meaning of the term \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?liberty\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? as used in the Fourteenth Amendment. First is the autonomous control over the development and expression of one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s intellect, interests, tastes, and personality. These are rights protected by the First Amendment and, in my view, they are absolute, permitting of no exceptions. See Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. l; Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 508 (dissent); Kingsley Pictures Corp. v. Regents, 360 U.S. 684, 697 (concurring); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 293 (Black, J., concurring, in which I joined). The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment is one facet of this constitutional right. The right to remain silent as respects one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s own beliefs, Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 196-199, is protected by the First and the Fifth. Third is the freedom to care for one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s health and person, freedom from bodily restraint or compulsion, freedom to walk, stroll, or loaf. These rights, though fundamental, are likewise subject to regulation on a showing of \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?compelling state interest.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? We stated in Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 164, that walking, strolling, and wandering \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?are historically part of the amenities of life as we have known them.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? As stated in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 29: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?There is, of course, a sphere within which the individual may assert the supremacy of his own will [410 U.S. 214] and rightfully dispute the authority of any human government, especially of any free government existing under a written constitution, to interfere with the exercise of that will.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? New Mexico Statute Code \u00c3?\u00c2\u00a730-3A-2: As provided in \u00c3?\u00c2\u00a730-3A-2, harassment consists of: A person (defendant) knowingly pursuing a pattern of conduct; The pattern of conduct is intended to annoy, seriously alarm or terrorize another person; The pattern of conduct serves no lawful purpose; and The conduct must be such that it would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress., 142833=The most recent issue in NMHU\u00c3\u00a2??s surrounding area, the town of Las Vegas, New Mexico: a CHILD PORNOGRAPHY ring. Dated December 16th 2014 in the Las Vegas Daily Times. It's just so crazy how many things can happen in such a small town with a population of only 13,000 people. Murders, domestic violence, assault, theft, vandalism, prostitution ring on the college campus and now a child porn ring at the elementary school! Something is surely wrong about this town and something needs to be done about it. I guess the movies are right about all the creepy things that happen in small isolated towns in the middle of nowhere, where only the town finds out but the rest of the country has no idea. Again, I think this is one of the most dangerous places to have a university. http://lvdailytimes.com/?p=122 The person who was caught taking pictures of the elementary school students was arrested for distributing child porn in July, 2014. These townie pedophiles never stop! http://www.fbi.gov/albuquerque/press-releases/2014/san-miguel-county-man-arrested-on-federal-child-pornography-charges, 112364=Message to all High School girls looking for colleges: One thing I really wish I did was try in high school. Your grades and GPA really do matter. Studying for ACT/SAT tests and taking them would be your best bet. Don't just pick a random college, scope them out first to look for your best interest or you might end up like me. I randomly chose a college called New Mexico Highlands University because I had no time. It was the end of July and this was one of the only rolling admission colleges I found on the internet. It has a 100% acceptance rate and is the cheapest 4 year university in the nation. Some of the student reviews didn't look good but I frantically needed somewhere to go out of state so I applied, didn't even visit first, and got dropped off in the middle of nowhere. If I had only researched this college more, it is located in Las Vegas, New Mexico. San Miguel County. One of the poorest cities and counties in the nation. Let me start off by the fact that I just don't understand how a college can exist in such a place like this. How the f*ck can you have an institute of higher learning in the murder capital of New Mexico according to FBI report in 2011? It is a small sketchy town where poverty has a way of creating soulless humans. It's pretty sketchy, there is a mental hospital that lets the crazy patients out and walk around town and into the dorms. The Hispanic/Mexican culture is brutal here. Most men beat the women and domestic violence rate is so high. Aggravated assault is higher than national average here and so is sexual assault. The town in non-progressive. All every does is drink and do drugs and work at shitty fast food restaurants. People from out of state, we call them townies for a reason. Don't ever date them or trust them. The first year I was here I was raped by a local townie guy that I had a relationship with. The next year I witnessed domestic violence from the second relationship and unfortunately was nice enough not to report it when the neighbors called the cops. Even when they saw my hands bleeding. Only to get cheated on and f*cked over by him a week later and knowing that I protected him at first gave him enough to say it never happened. Crime is so well covered up here and at the university because some things you have to know about the town of LV, NM: 1. You are either in a relationship 2. You are related to everyone 3. The combination of the both (inbreds). Small towns like this one don't take too kindly to outsiders. Reporting something a townie has done to you will probably get you absolutely no where because of the racist and biased administration. Some other things I learned from living here is that no matter what kind of degree you have, even if it is a Doctor's degree you are still a straight up piece of sh*t. Still trying to rip people off and act like your fellow townies, stealing, lying, cheating and breaking laws. Everyone, in a high up position or homeless has the same sketchy personality, it doesn't matter. This town and University is a hell hole with sociopathic culture and I advise every girl seeking a good education to not come here., 138411=Hispanic students and pretty much anyone of colors. White people are discriminated against here most of the time. NMHU got sued for violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and discriminating against a white employee, not paying her as much as the Hispanic/Mexicans were being paid. http://www.aauw.org/resource/demartin-v-new-mexico-highlands-university/ Another court case for some other white person being discriminated against: http://www.aaup.org/report/academic-freedom-and-tenure-new-mexico-highlands-university, 147823=Preface: I'm extremely objective. Logic and reasoning rule my life. This is how bad it is, from a transplant's perspective. You might think I'm being intolerant, but perhaps that is only because I'm fighting fire with fire. Everything Jon posted is true. It's the worst place to live. Sure, I'm just here for grad school, but even after just a year, I'm ready to get out of here (I was going to hold-off on writing a review until I was finally out of here... oh well). If you are Caucasian, you will be racially profiled (it doesn't matter how courteous you are). You will get any ticket plausible. Prepare to raise hell with the local government, because god forbid they give their cousin a ticket. The parks here are in disrepair. Every picnic table looks like a savage pack of animals came through and destroyed the landscaping. The buildings in the Plaza have bullet holes in them. Drunkards come from any outlet to bombard you in the park. People get high in their vans and drive around. People get drunk at any point during the day and drive around. A few months ago, an older guy was drinking and had very young girls in his car and killed all of them. This place is awful. Now on to the nitty-gritty. The food here is barely passable. For all the exclamations of great chile, I can make better at home. The chile from just about any restaurant is nasty. How do you possibly screw-up something your region is supposedly famous for? The rest of the food uses the worst ingredients and is never spiced/herbed. Despite being a stop on I-25, the food is outrageously expensive. And awful. I can tell you there are about 5 good places to eat in town: El Fidel, JC's, Little Saigon, 5th Quarter Grill, and Oriental King. Maybe Plaza if you catch them on a good day (although their new chef is a joke). If you want good New Mexican food, go to Santa Fe or Albuquerque. Law enforcement. I touched on this earlier. They absolutely do not want to ticket the natives here. If you pass through, read up on all the weird and asinine laws of the area because they will ticket you for anything if your license plate doesn't say, 'New Mexico'. You will see people here speed through stop signs, refuse to use their indicator, and swerve all over the road. But expect to get a ticket for going 41 in a 35 when there are zero speed limit signs where you are driving. Just a precaution. Even if you try to get your plates changed here, it will take probably a minimum of 9 months. There is even a website about it on their government page, and you can buy a book about it for $12! How fortunate is that?! Education. If you are an underachiever, you will fit right in. I think this is mostly due to Highlands not requiring any kind of ACT/ SAT/ GRE. They really don't care. They just want cash flow. I've been a TA here, and I've had maybe three good students. The rest are just... awful. Sorry. This town attracts awful students. Even awful graduate students. I can't even talk in class without people getting offended that I know so much. Perhaps basing my decision on finances was a poor choice, in retrospect. The tuition here is the most amazing aspect of any MS in Clinical Psychology. And the professors are out-of-this-world awesome. But I will put in quadruple the effort of anyone here and the others will still get the same grade as myself. But the undergrads that are intelligent are very few and far between. I can't tell you how many Freshman deserved failing grades. But the school insists that you not do that. For a college town, they are awfully anti-collegiate. The People. The people are nice enough on the outside. I wouldn't call them curt, but poverty has a way of creating a person that doesn't really care about his/her surroundings. I've mostly encountered nice people, but it is impossible making friends here. Everyone has a child. Well, pretty much. And their time/ money goes toward that. Anyone you meet will probably have a child. I could probably set the average age at 15 and above. Funny story. I was having dinner at the Plaza, and had to use the restroom. My fiance also had to... Incidentally, it was also the high school prom night. She came out laughing hysterically because a girl in their was pregnant, and was concerned that she might have the baby on the dance floor. Really. ... Even the people that come to the program are hard to interact with. They act nice, but they really don't care about making lasting friends. As a 'social butterfly', it's impossible to make lasting friends here. Because the standards here for being a moral/courteous human being are so low, it is a hassle trying to maintain being courteous to people (as you can tell, I'm about at my breaking point). I sometimes wonder how the waiters/waitresses are able to change their personalities so drastically between life and work. Public Affairs. Okay, so you may have heard of Charlie's Bakery. And how delicious it is. But have you ever heard of him preventing businesses from coming into town? Okay, sure, you want to preserve your little business, but you are also contributing to your city's population decline. When you visit this website, do you see the -7% population demographic in the table? Well, in other websites, it's more like -10-15%. There's a reason why there are so many transients. Do you actually think we want to reside in a culture-less town? Do you think that preventing other businesses from coming into town, that you're going to gain culturally-competent students and transplants? Do you? If there's nothing drawing anyone here, what kind of people are going to come here? And forget those lofty dreams of implementing a PsyD program here. Everyone will defect after a couple years anyway, and the administrators will wonder why. It's a damned monopoly here. And forget the actual city government. They're as corrupt as they come. Everyone here has their roots and anyone elected will continue to be elected (family feud), so don't expect any actual change. Everyone here wants the city to continue being it's dusty old self. Well, the lack of economy majors here can testify that it's a dying community. How sad is it that a few greedy business owners and politicians will the economic death of the community in which they live? They have an obnoxious motor cycle rally every year, and that pretty much sustains the economy. Don't think twice about the poverty here, because we've got a MOTORCYCLE RALLY! HELL YEAH! Drugs. It is sad. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a major problem here. It's like condoms are never introduced to the school health programs. The parents will deny like hell that they drank during their pregnancy. But you can tell they're lying due to certain unmentionable factors. I want the program at Highlands to start offering practicum to do parenting classes. Because that's how bad it is here. I'm sure we could get enough court referrals for it. As for drugs used by adults by themselves... don't go behind any businesses. It's gross how many people are drug-dealing or are prostituting. Just stay away from Grand in general. One time when I was going to the Plaza for dinner, I saw some people toking it up in their van in the back parking lot. Thirty minutes later, guess what! It's the band for the night. They saw us and flinched and went to the other dining area. Now, onto the drinking problem. I think my intro paragraph settles that pretty well. People here, it's like they've nothing better to do but drink and drive. It's kind of their thing around these parts. Who cares that there's a free DWI van service around here. Drinking and driving sustains the wanderlust need here. Employment. It's a joke. My fiance was state/racially-profiled pretty bad. She has a college degree and was not hired for basic jobs. I talked a bit with a friend who used to live here (he moved in December, haha). He reports he faced prejudice pretty badly out here for being a Caucasian transplant. My fiance just recently got a job, working independently with an incredibly nice boss. I guess it's just a game of chance, but whatever. When I have my degree from here, all the businesses will want me to stay! But I'm of mind to repay the favor. In this case, it's to leave as soon as I'm licensed. Now for the pros: Living out of town is just peachy. I really like being in the mountains. There's a certain serenity that doesn't involve being bombarded by revving Harley's. Oh wait, there are ATV's that will ruin your peaceful twilight anyway. But when that's not happening, it really is tranquil. Seeing lightning storms pass through is pretty majestic. From my house, I can see all of LV. And the landscapes I see are amazing. The sunsets out here are to die for. Graduate education. If you are a 4.0 student, please don't let your standards go to sh*t. Please, we really don't need any more underachievers. The teachers here will blow your mind on how intelligent they are. Prepare to make A LOT of great friends/ references. It's the only thing keeping me anchored here. Additionally, it's a program that pretty much grants licensure out of school. So you can start practicing either in NM or CO (because of reciprocal laws). So there's always that reward of sticking it out! I hope I can last that long. Because it's sad that I'm waiting for the new graduates in the fall to try to make more cultured friends. And I don't abandon my friends. Having student loans pretty much puts you at the top-of-town around here. El Fidel is probably the one place that you can't go to every week. But no matter. All the asinine tickets you get will deter you from funding the dying economy around here (and serve only to further distance you from the community. I once had dreams of opening up a farmer's market stand, but honestly, this town can blow-all). Because this town DESPERATELY needs El Fidel. If they were to ever go out of business... ... Gotta leave this place. Living costs here are fantastic. That's probably one of the few pros about the area. A 1 Bedroom house that I'm renting out now would go for about $700 more in the Albany area in NY. The food, again, is expensive for some weird reason. But the rent costs are for clueless landlords. You just have to be careful about the landlord. My house is considered expensive (lol). So I have a good landlord. But just watch out for the bad ones. You can probably tell by how many teeth they have. Buying a house here when you're older could be a wise decision. Your moolah will go far here. The few I know travel a lot. Because, as they tell me, they can't blame me for wanting to get out of here. It seems to be a common goal. It's also convenient for traveling. You've got Taos, Santa Fe, and Little Vegas in nice 1.5 hour distances from each other (forming a kind of triangle!). Plan on going to those areas a lot and making distant friends. Plan on going to the Santa Fe Plaza and staying the night. Or a few nights. And then cry yourself to sleep when you arrive back in Vegas. Skiing in Sipapu is also really cheap. They frequently have incredible deals. Like this past spring, they offered FREE lodging. ... That's unheard of these days. Other times, they offer a flat-rate per car-full of people. It's beastly. In short, this is not a town that you want to live in if you still have a decent amount of spunk in your soul (and even if you love nature, you can find it elsewhere - like not on fire). Or if you are Caucasian. Or if you are cultured. If you are okay with the bare minimums, and you have zero standards, please, by all means, populate this town ;) Although I must make the distinction between zero standards and living minimally. Because I enjoy the latter. If you come here for higher education, just consider how you were raised. How you were raised may quickly end your fun here. I'm not a trust-fund kid (because, obviously, I chose the Master's program that fit my budget best - plus, what Master's program in this country gives assistantships to their students?). I grew up in a rural area in Upstate NY, 30 minutes from Albany. So it's pretty similar here - an hour and some to Santa Fe. What you can gather from this idea, is that this place is truly... under-served. We can only hope that change is in their future... Or that -7% population decline will keep increasing. http://www.bestplaces.net/backfence/viewcomment.aspx?id=64645607-1E3A-4D2E-982F-B86BAA21B63D&city=Las_Vegas_NM&p=53539940}",

    "textAfterTable": "Academic Rigor Half of the professors don't do their jobs. Even when a professor fails almost the entire class and many other people from other classes, they don't get fired because nobody wants to work at this kind of school. Most of the teachers aren't even real professors, they are grad students without a professor supervising them. Tips for prospective students Prospective students should pick a different school to go to if they are actually serious about having a good paying job. This school is unknown and will probably not get most people far. In three sentences This is not a very good school at all. It is a remedial school for bad kids to come get an easy and worthless degree. I don't feel like I'm at a real college, this reminds me of a public High School in a bad area.
