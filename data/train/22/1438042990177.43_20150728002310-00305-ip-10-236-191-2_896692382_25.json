    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck It is most definitely worth your money since most of the classes transfer to pretty much any university. The classes are more one-on-one with the teachers, so you can actually get more out of your hard-earned money!! Am enjoying being here I am very much enjoying my time here. I did not think I would start off at a community college, but the thought of attending a 25,000 student university scrared me. Aims is the step between high school and a university. It makes for an easier transition and you make great friends, since the college is relatively small. Am learning a lot The classes are Aims are very small, so you can grasp alot more from the class. The teachers are always available and ready to help!
