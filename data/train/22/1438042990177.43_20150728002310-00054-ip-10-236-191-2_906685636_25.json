I've had some very lenient teachers and also very thorough teachers. Study hard and make every effort to get the grade you want and deserve. I was admitted into NYU for the fall 2012, though I worked very hard I had some really great professors., 182523=This is the best part of this school it's price cannot get any better , I pay about $1900 and I am taking 14 credits which makes me a full-time student at the moment. Most folks start off by paying $20000 and up for each semester and are inundated by debt once they graduate, here that is not case , you will be debt free by the time you get your degree., 315149=Affordable compared to most of the schools in the city. Small classes 20:1. You always know what classes you need to take.}",
