DWO is a fan site dedicated to bringing you all the latest from the world of Doctor Who, providing News, Merchandise information, Reviews, Competitions, Features, Forums and more... How long has the site been running? We've been running a Doctor Who site since 1996, when we were originally known as 'Doctor Who: The REGENERATIVE Website' (a bit of a mouthful, we know). It wasn't until 2000 when we had a chance meeting with Tom Baker, where he actually suggested the name 'Doctor Who Online'. Who argues with The Doctor, right? Is it true DWO is a 100% Spoiler-Free site? It is true! We pride ourselves on the fact that we stay away from spoilers, or anything that gives away plot details that the BBC haven't officially confirmed themselves. You",
