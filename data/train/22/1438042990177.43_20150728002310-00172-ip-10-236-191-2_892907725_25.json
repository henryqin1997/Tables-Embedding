            "campus security has very little issues through-out the year, and the town itself is super safe!",
            "excellent opportunity for social functions, lifelong friends, and leadership roles! there are currently (as of 2012) 3 fraternities, and 4 sororities. recruitment is in the fall (usually september) & i would highly encourage anyone to give it a try & meet the groups of men & women who make up our greek life, here at au.",
            "the town of ashland honestly has little to offer most students in the form of fun unless you enjoy going to the same 3-5 sports bars, bowling, or looking at antique shops. with that being said though, cab (campus activities board) puts on many events through-out the year (often something every week) and they are always pretty entertaining options such as: comedians, illusionists, hypnotists, musicians, and even more unique options like foam dance parties. community service opportunities are also plentiful on campus thanks to community care which features several teams that focus on different aspects of service like youth, animals, or the elderly. bottom line- staying on campus is more fun usually than going around the town of ashland, or driving to columbus or cleveland (located an hour away or so) are much better options.",
            "ashland spoils its students when it comes to campus dining. they have won awards for many years, often ranking in the top 3 places for best campus dining in the nation. there are several stations that are always offering typical things like sandwiches, or pasta, but the rest of the stations feature daily specials which change every day. the food itself is always pretty good. very rarely is there a time when i cannot find anything i would enjoy eating at any given meal. the hours of operation are also nice because they are flexible around a typical student's busy life. students also have a say every year in what items will be on the menu because the school holds an annual food show & students get to vote on what will be placed on the menu! there are also holiday special nights for valentines day, thanksgiving, halloween, etc. convo. as students call it really is awesome.",
            "ashland offers many different styles of dorm life for students to choose from. there are girl/boy only dorms, or there are co-ed (by floor) dorms. most of the dorms have been re-modeled recently with the exception of one or two. if students choose to join a sorority or fraternity they may have the choice to live in a fraternity house, or sorority suite which is a nice change from typical dorms. also, when students become seniors they can look forward to senior apartments which feature leather furniture and air-conditioning.",
            "speaking personally for my own major (early childhood education), i can say that i know i am getting much more experience in classrooms than many of my friends from high school who chose other schools. i also love seeing the looks on people's faces when i tell them i'm not a practicing teacher yet; i'm just a college senior. then, the person tends to ask me where i go to school & i tell them ashland & they say something along the lines of oh, yeah... that's not surprising. i have never heard a student say (from any major) that they weren't receiving adequate knowledge from their professors. ashland truly has high standards and i'm going ot be very proud to show off my degree with their name on it.",
            "take a tour! looking through brochures and listening to happy students like me tell you about campus isn't going to do it enough justice unless you come to campus & witness what it has to offer for yourself. don't be afraid to ask questions or tell people that you meet what you are interested in. the students, professors, and any faculty member you meet will be very willing to tell you how they feel about any program that is offered or even the town itself. talking to a variety of people on campus & realizing how friendly everyone was (even in the town itself) is a large part of why i chose to attend ashland.",
            "ashland is great for students who are looking for a home-like atmosphere, featuring small class sizes and lots of personal attention. the campus is beautiful and was founded on judeo-christian values which do play a role in some of the clubs that are offered on campus as well as the conservative-nature of the entertainment & events on campus. while ashland university is definitely not the cheapest private school in ohio, it is classified as middle of the road (price-wise) & is also mid-sized."

Who's got more bang for your buck than that?, 6004=This school is great for education and business majors! There are more than 70 undergraduate programs here at Ashland but the majority of the students come here for business or education. They are great at getting you experience in the field you desire your freshman year. With the student to faculty ratio being 15:1 it allows your professors to really get to know you allowing it easier for the student to get help if needed., 275475=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Ashland is great for students looking for a school that is not too big and not too small. It is also very popular for the Education and Business programs. It's also great for any one who likes really good food all the time! Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid of the price! Visit the campus it's beautiful! If you have any questions don't be afraid to contact someone they will be more thn willing to help you. Ashland has been awesome with keeping us updated on what we need for the future! Bang for the buck The overall tuition of almost $35,000 may be overwhelming but because this is a private school we can help pay for a lot of that. A large majority of the students receive a presidential scholarship based on their high school GPA and ACT scores. Also the financial aid office works very well with you personally to help you with any special requests or circumstances. Am enjoying being here More than half of the students here are involved in campus activities including sports, intramurals, religious life, sororities, fraternities, and community service. It is very easy to get involved in something especially because there are wide",
