            "Open community model for exchanging information in dynamic environments - An open community model for information exchange enables individuals to plan and attain superior outcomes in a dynamic environment. A continually \u201cworld model\u201d maintains information about the dynamic environment that is valuable for individuals of the open community. An open community model application publicizes a specification of relevant types of information it receives from suppliers and provides to consumers. Suppliers provide information consistent with the specification. Consumers utilize received information to reduce uncertainties or errors in the assumed environment so they can generate improved plans or improve their expected outcomes. Consumers give feedback to the open community model about the quality of information they received. A \u201cworld model\u201d application combines information received to update and improve its understanding of the dynamic environment and its estimates of relevant parameters. The community model simplifies the creation and operation of information markets where innovative products are naturally selected and economically reinforced.",
            "System and Method for Promoting Truth in Public Discourse - The present invention enables people to propose campaigns for crowd-source funding intended to label some public claim as bogus or to label some public claim that's being widely denied as true. A fee and several inputs are required to submit the proposed campaign application for vetting, review, editing and approval. Approved campaigns are published on a website so people can find them and contribute to them. A cash bounty is offered as a reward to any challenger who can refute (falsify) the campaign message. A fee and several inputs are required to submit a challenge for evaluation and decision. Challenges are processed sequentially until one is sustained (upheld as proving the campaign position is wrong), or until the campaign duration expires. When a challenge is sustained, the bounty is paid to the challenger, other pending challenges are closed and their fees are returned, and the campaign ends as \u201cfalsified\u201d (\u201cunsuccessful\u201d). When the campaign duration expires without a sustained challenge, the campaign ends as \u201csuccessful\u201d and a monetary reward is paid to the campaign creator and the remainder of the unspent bounty is returned to the sponsors in proportion to their contributions to the campaign fund. Sponsors can provide comments and evidence to augment the campaign materials."

The first data message is addressed to a second embedded node. The method also includes encrypting the first data message to produce an encrypted data message, where the encryption is transparent to the first embedded node. The method further includes transmitting the encrypted data message to a second end point device. An apparatus includes a plurality of embedded node ports each configured to communicate with an embedded node. The apparatus also includes an encrypted communications link port configured to communicate with an end point device. The apparatus further includes a controller connected to communicate with the embedded node ports and the encrypted communications link port. In addition, the apparatus includes a storage connected to be read from and written to by the controller. 04-30-2009 Frederick Ho, Union City, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20080302233 Digital music systems - Digital music systems,",
