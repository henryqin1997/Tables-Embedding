            "Campus safety are always on top. Saint Paul college Public safety are always helpful towards the students/faculties because, when something happened the security(s) come with the speed of light. Other then that, they discuss and fix issues with students more then any other staff members around the school.",
            "The Greek life? I am unsure of what the Greek life is in my school.",
            "there are vary of clubs and activities at Saint Paul College. such as, Asian Student Association (ASA), Phi Khra Peta, environmental society, student senate, student life, and Primes. As you can see, my school do not have a lot of groups, therefore, not a lot of other students actively join them.",
            "If you come to Saint Paul college, everything is great for students. Learning about others ethnically and also learning about your own.",
            "At Saint Paul College, we have no unusual traditions or locations on campus because I hope my school is an equal school that does not care about what unusual traditions or location is on campus. I mean, it is other's tradition/ location why ask or care.",
            "Bang for the buck? I am unsure what this means. but my guess would that I need this scholarship because, Financial Aid is not helping me pay half of my tuition, so i would have to pay that out of my pocket. I would like to be a part of this scholarship because I am tired of paying when Fasfa was supposed to help pay. I guess my part-time job makes too much. REALLY? it's just 8.00/hours.",
            "At saint Paul College, there are a lot of fun. such as, play showings, events, and a fitness center. sadly the school does not provide or have a gym.",
            "The food and dining at Saint Paul College are simple. One side of the cafeiteria has a station for hamburgers and french fries only. and then, on the other side are the train chefs that has one or two years left of graduating cooks for us student. I personally think there foods are okay, not the best, but okay.",
            "sadly, there're no housings or dorm, so we as student would not know how the dorm life is like. But when we transfer to a university, we will then learn about the dorm life.",
            "the academic rigor here are awesome. Everyone here are smart in there own ways and it does show that instructors are improving to help their students to achieve.",
            "Some tips for prospective students would be: 1) to come to school prepared 2) College is not like high school anymore 3) study and then do homework AND Finally, 4) remember to have some fun",
            "From 1-10, 1 being the worst and 10 being the best. I would rate Saint Paul College a 9 out of 10 because, the instructors are always there when you need them and when students are stuck on for example, math, writing papers, or reading, there're always tutors that loves helping others out, even from different education levels they are willing to stay and help. I love this school."
