Orlando has won four in a row in Charlotte. -- at Charlotte - Series tied, 6-6 -- at Orlando - Orlando leads, 10-2 All-time: Orlando leads, 16-8 Magic vs. Bobcats Buckle up. Here we go. You know the drill by now; opponents are forced to pick their poison. Orlando will stretch the opposition\u2019s defense with the Magic three-ball, while also looking to establish Dwight Howard in the post. The Magic\u2019s ball movement will be important. It will also be important for Howard to use his speed and quickness against the Bobcats\u2019 bigs. It boils down to taking care of the ball, moving it from side to side, and Superman in the paint, or his super friends on the perimeter. Magic Offense First, Orlando will have to defend Stephen Jackson and Gerald Wallace, especially limiting their dribble drives for easy looks at the rim. Next, the Magic need to work on shutting down the inside-outside attack presented by Boris Diaw. He can play both in the paint and on the perimeter which presents an interesting match-up. Finally, transition defense will be important with Raymond Felton and D.J. Augustine",
