The rule amended FDA's postmarketing safety reporting regulations for human drugs and biological products to require that persons subject to mandatory reporting requirements submit safety reports in an electronic format that FDA can process, review, and archive. FDA is also announcing the availability of the Safety Reporting Portal (SRP), a Web-based electronic submission system, for the electronic submission of postmarketing individual case safety reports (ICSRs) of adverse events for human drug and nonvaccine biological products. The SRP is intended to facilitate the secure electronic submission of postmarketing ICSRs and ICSR attachments to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The SRP creates a simple and efficient mechanism for electronic reporting of ICSRs that does not require an internal database that is compatible with the International Conference on Harmonisation-based direct submission system. FDA is delaying the compliance date for the final rule because FDA understands that not all persons subject to mandatory postmarketing reporting requirements who wish to use the newly available Safety Reporting Portal (SRP) will have the opportunity to register for an account and test the submission process prior to June 10, 2015, the effective date of the final rule., 25700=21 U.S. Code \u00a7 221 to 237 - Repealed.

This document corrects those errors., 38128=The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this proposed rule to amend the 1994 tentative final monograph or proposed rule (the 1994 TFM) for over-the-counter (OTC) antiseptic drug products. In this proposed rule, we are proposing to establish conditions under which OTC antiseptic products intended for use by health care professionals in a hospital setting or other health care situations outside the hospital are generally recognized as safe and effective. In the 1994 TFM, certain antiseptic active ingredients were proposed as being generally recognized as safe for use in health care settings based on safety data evaluated by FDA as part of its ongoing review of OTC antiseptic drug products. However, in light of more recent scientific developments, we are now proposing that additional safety data are necessary to support the safety of antiseptic active ingredients for these uses. We also are proposing that all health care antiseptic active ingredients have in vitro data characterizing the ingredient's antimicrobial properties and in vivo clinical simulation studies showing that specified log reductions in the amount of certain bacteria are achieved using the ingredient., 13528=The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a final rule entitled \u201cPostmarketing Safety Reports for Human Drug and Biological Products; Electronic Submission Requirements\u201d that appeared in the Federal Register of June 10, 2014 (79 FR 33072).
