In the third quarter of 2013, it grabbed a 32 percent share of the solar installation market, and it expected to grow its number of installations by more than 80 percent in 2014. This means it could deploy upwards of 525 Megawatts of photovoltaic cells this year alone., 806288=The reason to reduce the stock price is so that they will get more shares in future payments. \u00a0On the other hand, if the stock price remains low at the end of the nine months, most of the new stock issued will go to the company insiders who bought the $1 million subordinated notes. \u00a0A low share price at the end of the nine months would also likely mean a low share price in early 2014, when Axion will most likely need to raise additional funds. \u00a0If the share price is low then, Axion will likely be forced into another, even less favorable deal, and they will find themselves diluted just like Axion\u2019s long term shareholders are now., 579452=Posted by Tom Konrad at 02:34 PM | Permalink | Comments (0), 8288=Some of our arguments have been discussed in prior Seeking Alpha articles by other authors, including here, here, here, and here. For instance, in our report, we discuss how ABAT\u2019s SAIC filings show that the company\u2019s actual revenue and profit are a fraction of what is reported in SEC filings. We also show that ABAT\u2019s $20 million acquisition of a Shenzhen battery company appears to be a sham, and that ABAT paid $20 million in 2010 for an entity that they had previously bought in 2008 for $1 million, but had not disclosed to public investors., 98366=Posted by John Petersen at 02:58 PM | Permalink | Comments (0), 341866=Posted by John Petersen at 04:58 PM | Permalink | Comments (0), 514=Other Chinese battery manufacturers which are not active in the lithium polymer market can also be compared to ABAT.

Tesla says it will reduce battery pack cost/kWh by more than 30 percent by the time its third-generation vehicles ramp in 2017. Battery systems for stationary energy storage applications are a bit different -- air-cooled, a simpler battery management system, and it's all around a lot cheaper. It's not uncommon among Asian manufactures to have multiple variations of a battery cell coming off individual lines, pointed out Sam Jaffe, senior research analyst at Navigant Research. There's also the possibility that the company could tweak its battery chemistry used in Gigafactory, though probably still a variant of lithium-ion.

The facility was described as \u201cfour empty walls\u201d, the inadequacy of which made him suspect Wuxi was some sort of distributor operation rather than a manufacturing facility.

    "textBeforeTable": "The battery problem is easy to understand. In a conventional car the battery starts the engine when you leave for work and it has to recover enough charge during your commute to restart the engine when you head home at night. With a stop-start system, the battery has to start the engine when you leave for work, carry the accessory loads during engine-off intervals, restart the engine on demand, and recover its state of charge as quickly as possible in preparation for the next engine off opportunity. The pattern repeats on the trip home. The following table highlights the differences in battery duty cycles for a 15-mile commute with an average of one engine-off event per mile. Stop-start is a classic disruptive technology; a simple baby step that opens the door to improvements in fuel economy that nobody even considered a few years ago. The only fly in the ointment is the reality that yesterday's automotive batteries are simply not durable or robust enough for the immense electrical loads stop-start systems require them to carry. Regardless of how you judge the merit of an automotive efficiency technology, a production ramp from zero vehicles in 2005 to planned production of 15 to 22 million vehicles a year by 2015 is extraordinary. While most investors don't even know that stop-start exists, the technology has already crossed the chasm",
    "textAfterTable": "Think about the table for a minute. An optimized stop-start system requires 100 times the work from its battery; two full orders of magnitude. This is not a simple problem with an easy fix. Recent studies from BMW and Ford show that flooded lead-acid batteries start to degrade in a matter of weeks and more expensive AGM batteries start to degrade within a couple months, but the batteries don't simply die. Instead, their charge recovery time increases from 30 seconds with a new battery to four minutes or more after a few thousand miles. Since stop-start systems disable themselves until the battery regains an appropriate state of charge, longer charge recovery times make the mechanical systems less efficient and eat into potential fuel savings. In many cases, stop-start systems lose most of their functionality within six months. It's sure to become a huge problem when pollution control inspectors start testing for stop-start functionality. Finding a solution now is a major challenge for both automakers and the battery industry. In an effort to compensate for the shortcomings of conventional lead-acid batteries, automakers are upgrading from flooded batteries to AGM batteries, or to dual battery systems that use flooded batteries for starter loads and AGM batteries for accessory loads. The first big beneficiaries of these battery upgrades will be Johnson Controls and Exide Technologies ( XIDE). Both companies are building new AGM battery manufacturing capacity at a blistering pace",
