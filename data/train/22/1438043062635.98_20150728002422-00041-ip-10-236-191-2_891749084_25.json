Because the data in BioSense 2.0 belong to the organizations in which they originate (including hospitals, HIEs, and local and state health departments), the organization defines the level of data sharing. Information-sharing permissions are set at the organization level, which means that epidemiologist-level users in an organization have the same level of access to view data. Organizations can include a single hospital or a network of hospitals, HIEs, local and state health departments. (In addition, one individual at each organization will be designated as the data custodian with the responsibility to set the level of data sharing for organization and to approve new user",
