            "They are expensive, but also have amazing academic programs. Plus they offer credits for IB and AP classes. Plus they also have an amazing financial aid office that focuses on getting the students more grants than loans",
            "I love how they are smack dab in the middle of the city, they have buildings right on city streets, and if you don't like the city feel, you can also take a 15 min shuttle ride to their Mount Vernon campus which is full of green feilds and has a more rural feel. Also if you want to take smaller classes with a smaller clss size, you can opt to take them on the Vern (Mount Vernon campus)",
            "They have an amazing academic program for the major that I'm aiming for, and great class sizes and structures. They also have many intership programs, and over 80% of the students get at least one in their time there. they are also right next to The State Department."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{171674=Every month our provost actually hosts Pancakes with the Provost - he invites all students to his house, makes them a pancake breakfast, and has light conversation with all of those who chose to attend. The pumpkin pancakes he makes in October are to die for., 62053=The main spot for dining and food on campus is located at the Marvin Center in the middle of campus. Its dining area includes many non-brand restaurants and food stands that serve delicious and respectable dishes and recipes. However, there are some stands that I do not favor, mainly because it serves foreign food from a specific culture that does not taste good to me (forgot the name, but its right next to the Chinese restaurant stand in the left corner of the entrance on 21st street). There is also an Auntie Anne's within the dining area, and it has quickly become a student favorite in the first year it has been there. For those looking for a healthier option, there is also a food line in the middle that serves fruit, greens and vegetables (especially useful for those who are vegan or vegetarian), and cold food. Pita Pitt, Dunkin Donuts, Potbellys, and Gallery in the Ivory Tower dining area are also options. There is also a deli called GW Deli that is just like a regular deli for those looking for a humbler and genuine eating experience. Whole Foods, Roti, and Burger Tap and Shakes, 7-11, and Sweetgreen are all across the street from GW Hospital. Chipotle, Bertucci (Italian restaurant), and Johnny Rockets are in 2000 Pennsylvania Avenue. Fridays, Panda Cafe are also on Pennsylvania. CVS is also located in 2000 Penn. and E Street NW, respectively. Fobogro is a GW-owned sandwich spot that is also a popular spot on campus. Starbucks is also located in Gelman Library. Then, you have Carvings (located in Potomac Hall and is like the Deli), Subway, and 7-11 on the other edge of campus. For Mount Vernites, students have dining in Ames Hall and West Hall, as well as off-campus places such as Panda Cafe and Safeway., 191196=GWPD (The police force of GW) is present throughout campus at all times. Plus, living so close the White House the area is extremely safe, with the blue light system being implemented. Also, GW provides a safety escort service called 4Ride that functions from 7:00 pm-5:00 am every day that will pick one up and drop one off within certain limits of the campus. But it goes pretty far from the central campus so it's awesome!, 313839=J Street, our dining hall, is not amazing. Freshman have to have $700/semester on their campus card (GWorld) for J Street, and that will most likely be annoying. Almost everyone dislikes J Street. Yet, the other part of a freshman meal plan is $1000/semester to spend at surrounding restaurants and grocery stores, which is nice. Ultimately, the food is not terrible in J Street, but there are not too many options. There is generic Chinese, generic Indian, generic Italian, a cold cut station, a hot bar, a Vietnamese sandwich place, and an Auntie Anne's., 156948=Average cost of a 1 bedroom apartment in DC or Arlington (which is where most people tend to live) is around $1800 dollars. The metro or bus system is great source of transportation in the DC metro area. There are some more affordable housing options further out in VA or MD within the metro area, but it will be a longer commute to GWU (up to an hour). Silver Spring is a cheaper, nice metro accessible area, but it is a longer commute. Do Not move to Anacostia in the SE (pull up a crime map and you will see why)! In general you will not need a car in this area. There is a ton of public transit and in general you will have to pay for a parking space anywhere from $50-200/mo. There are ZipCars available, which are basically rental cars that can be utilized if you need to go outside of the metro area. They cost around $80-150/day and you do not pay for the gas. All of the surrounding airports (IAD/BWI/Regan) are accessible via public transit (metro/bus/train). There are a lot of great bars and restaurants throughout the city, however they are more expensive than most other college campus areas. Happy hour is generally the way to go!, 142521=As a freshman you're given 1,000 dollars Colonial Cash and 700 J street. Colonial cash can be used anywhere (including getting your nails done and buying books) and if you just use that 1000 dollars for food you will be a happy camper, but usually people run through that very quickly. J street food is horrible, you get generic Aramark options of either Asian, Italian, Homestyle, Kosher, or Diner style at first it sounds great, but they have the same options every day and after eating ALL of the food makes you feel groggy and gross. A great place to go if you want to ween off food and transition into dieting., 99542=Monument walks, the National Zoo, the Smithsonians, concerts at 9:30 club, shopping at Dupont, Metro Center, or Eastern Market, eating out at Adams Morgan or U Street, etc., 356044=Depending on if one lives on the Vern or Foggy Bottom. Thurston Hall is full of a 1000 freshmen, it is forever noisy and crammed, typical party atmosphere 24/7. The vern is quiet and peaceful yet occasionally very boring., 401112=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 352529=GW has beautiful housing. We're very spoiled. Freshman year, most students live in the main dorm (Thurston), which houses over 1000 freshmen. Many freshmen also opt to live on the Mount Vernon Campus (a 15 minute bus ride from the Foggy Bottom Campus), where dorms are brand new and a little more pricey. While Mount Vernon has a very picturesque and quiet campus, I found it very isolated and removed from the rest of GW. Student life is very incorporated into the city, but obviously where you live and who you live with is just as important., 10683=If you're set on GW apply early because it's getting more and more competitive. My class was the most competitive they've ever had and it will only get more competitive. I think my class of 2350 was picked out of 21000. Visit! GW isn't your typical college or university. It doesn't have a traditional dining hall (we do have J Street and many other vendors), there isn't a typical college feel, and nobody really knows where the campus begins and ends (Who knew you could have labs on K Street?). It's more of a city feel than I expected. On the college-y feel spectrum from NYU (big city school) to Bates (small NESCAC college) it's between NYU and UPenn, UPenn being more of a college-y feel. Make sure you also ask your tour guides anything you're dying to know. They're very helpful., 187259=A+++. I'm living in Madison for my freshman year, and it is fantastic. The rooms are on the older side, but they are BIG! There are also bathrooms in each room, which is true for most all of the other dorms. By sophomore, most dorm rooms also include kitchens. Most freshman will live in Thurston, which houses about 1000 freshmen and is a great scene for making friends and getting the full freshman college experience. Dorm life on the Mount Vernon campus is also fantastic since West Hall is brand new, has a dining hall in the basement, and has a 24 hour gym. Not to mention that the quads in West have a common space and individual rooms for each person!, 361505=The GWorld card is awesome. It allows you to eat tax free at a bunch of different locations throughout the city (TGI Fridays, Bertucci's, etc.). You can even use it for grocery shopping at SafeWay and Whole Foods. The only downside is freshman year you are required to spend $1400 at the cafeterias in West Hall or the Marvin Center., 9061=Political people (duh): There's always some rally going on. Move in day coincided with Glenn Beck's March to Restore Honor, two weekends ago there was a huge liberal rally, and in two weekends Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert are having their March to Keep Fear Alive/Restore Sanity. International Affairs Majors: The Elliot Schools is highly regarded, one of the top ten IA programs in the nation I believe. Also students get so much exposure to international affairs because of all of the international students and because we're surrounded by embassies. And people really do trick or treat. Work hard play hard: You'll find a range of students at GW and you'll sometimes ask yourself How the hell did she get into this school? but overall GW students are smart kids. They weren't the kids who shut themselves in their rooms on Saturday nights studying, but they got good grades while having a good time. LGBQTS (and any other letters I left out): There are so many gay guys here. It sucks for girls, especially since so many of the gay guys are nice and cute (and they dress well). Although GW is big enough that you can find your niche anywhere. You can be a hipster, a frat bro, athlete, Republican, or any stereotype you can name. Even though we're in DC, people don't talk politics all the time, though I'm sure if you wanted to, you could easily get yourself into a debate over whatever was most recently announced on CNN., 81700=From my visit to the Foggy Bottom campus on June 12, 2012, I learned and saw first hand how amazing this school was. The school of business that I plan to attend even set up a one on one tour and counseling session. It was extremely helpful to hear from a current student worker., 69069=George Washington University is a private, co-educational university primarily in the Foggy Bottom section of Northwest, Washington, DC. Its proximity to various important governmental and financial landmarks such as the White House, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the headquarters of the United States Department of State makes it one of the top 3 schools nationwide for political involvement, international affairs, and diplomacy. Named after George Washington, he had a vision before his death and the founding of the school in 1821 of building a school in the heart of Washington, DC dedicated to providing quality education for many young students from all over the relatively young nation., 118785=I'm going to split this up into different categories. Academics: ~Don't be afraid to take classes on Mount Vernon. It's the secondary campus and is more like a real college campus. You can take classes with 50 people (that's usually a maximum) on the Vern, when they're more like 200+ on Foggy Bottom. You just have to remember to give yourself enough time to get there. The school says the trip to the Vern can take anywhere from 10-30 minutes, but during rush hour (7:00-10:00 am and about 4:00-7:00 pm) it can take up to an hour, and bad weather makes it worse. I recommend, if you live on Foggy and take classes on the Vern, take them in the middle of the day. if you live on the Vern, take morning classes there and then go to Foggy for the afternoon (this is also really nice because depending on which dorm you live in, your class could literally be right across the street. I've woken up at 8:25 and made it to my 8:30 class on time). Housing: Be aware that the freshman dorms are not all they're cracked up to be. Thurston is either an absolute party or your worst nightmare. It's not all that nice, houses 1100 freshmen in one building, and you will have 3-5 roommates (these aren't suites--you are sharing one room, two closets, and a bathroom with 3+ other people). Most other dorms have doubles or triples. If you want to live in a nice dorm, look at Potomac or West. West is also nice because all of the rooms are single bedrooms in four-person suites and it was built in 2010 so it's the newest dorm on campus. The dorms that are closest to everything are Madison and Crawford. If you're looking for a smaller dorm where you'll know everyone, have some peace and quiet, and feel like you're part of a community, look at the Hillsides on Mount Vernon (Merriweather, Clark, Hensley, and Cole). these are nice because they're small and there is a definite sense of community, but they can also get a little claustrophobic by the end of the year. Student life: Get involved! GW isn't a big school, but it's big enough that you can really feel like you don't have a place. Student orgs help that and there are hundreds of options to choose from., 172699=Break the Foggy Bottom Bubble and explore the different neighborhoods in DC: Go shopping at Pentagon City or Columbia Heights; Grab some cupcakes in Georgetown; Grab some Ethiopian food in Adams Morgan; Catch concerts at the 9:30 Club or U-Street Music Hall on U-Street. Take the Foggy Bottom metro to pretty much anywhere within DC limits or the taxi when the metro's out of service. If you're looking for free entertainment, the Smithsonian museums are always there! There are all kinds of things to do both day and night if you know where to look -- and you'll quickly learn after just a few weeks here.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students GW is great for: ~political science or international affairs students - think of all the places you can intern and all the speakers who drop by! ~anyone interested in politics (especially Democrats) ~Jewish students - there is definitely an active Jewish life on campus ~basketball fans - it's pretty much our only sport (no football) ~anyone who loves DC or who comes from the middle of nowhere (like me) and wants to get used to the city life Tips for prospective students From my experience, if you think that you have even a vague chance of getting into the Honors college, apply. While you may have to write an extra essay for the application, in the end it is totally worth it. The university can be a bit bureaucratic and academic advisers can be at times slightly impersonal, but the Honors program is a great solution to this problem. The staff are some of the most amazing, dedicated people on campus, and they are overwhelmingly willing to help Honors students with any and every problem they encounter. Plus, we get free hot chocolate, priority registration, and free Georgetown cupcakes (you'll realize how awesome that is when you come here and try them!) Bang for the buck GW is",
