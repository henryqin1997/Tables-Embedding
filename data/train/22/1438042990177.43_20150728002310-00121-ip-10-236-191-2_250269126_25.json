Order will be placed on July 22., 73552=NO OpenMoko FreeRunner 900/1800 available anymore (on July 3, 2008 at 21h) as needed in Europe. Furthermore, confirmation: From Pulster.eu: Our sales price is 299 EUR + shipping 15 EUR in Europe = 314 EUR. The idea of \"open\" is ours. So check our price calculation: if you order the Freerunner from Taiwan, it's 399 USD + 100 USD shipping + c. 90 USD \"import taxes\" inside Europe. Total 589 USD = c.380 EUR. So it will be cheaper and we Europeans have 2 years of warranty when buying from Pulster, instead of a 14 days(?) for imported goods., 213139=Fran\u00e7ois Bianco is trying to create a new group of 10 (will be mostly for French Switzerland). -> The group moved to the EPFL group, which will try to reach 20 persons. --Fbianco 11:42, 11 June 2008 (UTC) Gabriel Ambuehl would volunteer to order the initial 10pack. <- still accurate\u00a0? -> Gabriel will not organize the 10packs for Z\u00fcrich due to not being in Switzerland. We are in contact to find a solution so please wait until we know what to do. Order in Germany (each for himself or as a group, not clear yet) could be as cheap as a 10pack. We are in contact with pulster.de and will be contacted form pulster about the price. We will contact you guys in the Z\u00fcrich list as soon as we know more --Tuxfux.ch 10:26, 6 June 2008 (UTC) Alexandre Ghisoli will not organize the second 10pack, since the order moved in the Lucca's group., 271042=Status: 16/20 at 2008-05-24, 259458=As of 8 July 2008 we still need five people to pay in order to complete a second batch of ten. Just because there are twenty names on this list doesn't mean you can't join in. PLEASE contact Bert or Michael in addition to adding yourself to the list, 204628=status:GSM 900 variant sold out, new stocks due July 25, 2008, 236154=ALREADY Ordered 18th July (Pulster.de), 235314=ordering 23 July Beware transfers has been done and the group is closed if you don't have enough people to make a 10+ group contact me and we will see if do another one, 226195=There is a problem with the GPS in the currently shipping Freerunners: Mail archive. I already orderd 200 \"10pf NPO 50V 0402\" capacitors for convenient reselling. They will arrive within 10 days from now (2008.07.21)., 183761=After discussion on the talk page, a number of us have decided to place an individual order at Pulster.eu, because they are cheaper than the group sale discount, and they deliver a receipt with VAT. I'd advise the people on this group sale-list to do the same. You can indeed place a group order at Pulster.eu, but that won't lower the price, and would only add extra shipping costs. (from the person who made the group-order to the individual members of the group) MadJo 11:04, 30 June 2008 (UTC), 97529=As it looks right now, it seems that it would be cheaper and easier for us to buy through Pulster in Germany - see the following email: http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-May/017778.html ~leinir, 212531=1x 10 Pack ordered from pulster for the group Z\u00fcrich!
