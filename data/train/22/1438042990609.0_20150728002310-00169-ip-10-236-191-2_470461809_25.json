In a preferred embodiment, the annular gasket 80 is formed of silicone rubber material such as GE SE6035 which is commercially available from General Electric. In another preferred embodiment, the annular gasket 80 is formed of copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate which are commercially available from E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. under the trade name ELVAX7.

Regardless of the particular material, the gaskets 80 may be prepared by conventional injection molding or compression molding techniques which are well-known by those of ordinary skill in the art., 62832=This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/959,973, filed Oct. 29, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,462 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/904,289, filed Jul. 31, 1997 entitled \u201cMethod and Composition for Producing Ultraviolet Blocking Lenses\u201d., 279546=An eyeglass lens was successfully cured with ultraviolet light utilizing a medium pressure mercury vapor lamp as a source of activating radiation (i.e., the UVEXS Model 912 previously described herein). The curing chamber included a six inch medium pressure vapor lamp operating at a power level of approximately 250 watts per inch and a defocused dichroic reflector that is highly UV reflective. A high percentage of infrared radiation was passed through the body of the reflector so that it would not be directed toward the material to be cured. The curing chamber further included a conveyer mechanism for transporting the sample underneath the lamp. With this curing chamber, the transport mechanism was set up so that a carriage would move the sample from the front of the chamber to the rear such that the sample would move completely through an irradiation zone under the lamp. The sample would then be transported through the zone again to the front of the chamber. In this manner the sample was provided with two distinct exposures per cycle. One pass, as defined hereinafter, consists of two of these distinct exposures. One pass provided a dosage of approximately 275 milliJoules measured at the plane of the sample using an International Light IL 1400 radiometer equipped with a XRL 340 B detector., 473290=The resulting lens was approximately 72 mm in diameter. The lens had a center thickness of 2.6 mm, a distance focusing power of \u22120.71-1.00 diopters, and a bifocal addition strength of 1.74 diopters. The lens appeared to have a bleached color of tan. Also, the lens that was formed exhibited approximately 75% visible transmittance as measured with a Hoya ULT-3000 meter. The lens was exposed to midday sunlight at a temperature of approximately 75\ufffd F. for 3 minutes. After being exposed to sunlight, the lens exhibited a grey color and a visible light transmittance of approximately 15%. The optics of the lens appeared to be crisp, without aberrated areas in either the distance or the bifocal segment regions. The same lens forming composition was cured to form a piano lens so that the lens could be scanned with a Hewlett Packard Model 8453 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. See FIG. 37 for a plot of % transmittance versus wavelength (nm), as exhibited by the piano lens in its lightened state (i.e., without sunlight exposure). The lens exhibited very little transmittance of light at wavelengths below about 370 nm., 168341=Results: The resulting lens measured 72 mm in diameter, with a central thickness of 2.0 mm, and an edge thickness of 9.2 mm. The focusing power measured \u22125.05 diopter. The lens was water clear (\u201cwater-white\u201d), showed negligible haze, exhibited total visible light transmission of about 94%, and gave good overall optics. The Shore D hardness was about 80. The sample withstood the impact of a 1 inch steel ball dropped from fifty inches in accordance with ANSI 280.1-1987, 4.6.4 test procedures., 98077=Apparatus, operating procedures, equipment, systems, methods, and compositions for lens curing using ultraviolet light are available from Rapid Cast, Inc., Q2100, Inc., and Fast Cast, Inc. in East Rockaway, N.Y. and Louisville, Ky. The Fast Cast, Inc. publication entitled \u201cOperation Manual For The FastCast LenSystem\u201d is hereby incorporated by reference., 356543=The assembly was subsequently returned to the UX-462 FlashCure unit. The non-casting surface of the back mold was exposed to four doses of high intensity UV light, totaling approximately 1150 mJ/cm2. The gasket was stripped from the assembly, and residual uncured material was wiped from the exposed edge of the lens. An oxygen barrier strip (i.e., polyethylene) was wrapped around the edge of the lens and the cell was exposed to two more doses of high intensity UV light, wherein 575 mJ/cm2 total were directed to the non-casting surface of the front mold. Eight more flashes of high intensity UV light followed. The eight flashes exposed the non-casting surface of the back mold to a total of 2300 mJ/cm2., 472324=After brushing, a stream of isopropyl alcohol was directed at the surface of the lens, and the rotation was continued for a period of approximately 30 seconds until the lens was dry. The lens was turned over on the stage so that the convex surface of the lens faced upward. Then the cleaning procedure was repeated on the convex surface. With the convex surface facing upward, the lens was dosed with four exposures of ultraviolet light totaling approximately 1150 mJ/cm2. The lens was again turned over on the stage such that the concave surface was upward. The lens was subjected to an additional two exposures totaling 300 mJ/cm2. The lens was removed from the stage and placed in a convection oven at 115\ufffd C. for five minutes. After annealing the lens, it was removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. At this point the lens was ready for shaping by conventional means to fit into an eyeglass frame., 477709=About 1000 grams of a background dye stock solution was prepared by mixing about 50 grams of a 592 ppm solution of Thermoplast Red 454/HDDMA, 50 grams of 490 ppm solution of Zapon Brown 286/HDDMA, 50 grams of 450 ppm solution of Zapon Brown 287/HDDMA, 50 grams of 1110 ppm solution of Oil Soluble Blue II/HDDMA, and 50 grams of a 1110 ppm solution of Thermoplast Blue P/HDDMA, all with 750 grams of PRO-629. The entire mixture was heated to a temperature between about 50\ufffd and 60\ufffd C. and stirred for two hours. This mixture was passed through an alumina basic column., 209652=A polymerizable lens forming composition may be placed in a mold/gasket assembly and continuously exposed to appropriate levels of ultraviolet light to cure the composition to an optical lens. The progress of the curing reaction may be determined by monitoring the internal temperature of the composition. The lens forming composition may be considered to pass through three stages as it is cured: (1) Induction, (2) Gel Formation & Exotherm, and (3) Extinction. These stages are illustrated in FIG. 20 for a \u22120.75-1.00 power lens cured by continuous application of UV light. FIG. 20 shows temperature within the mold cavity as a function of time throughout a continuous radiation curing cycle., 350496=The mold/gasket assembly was subsequently returned to the UX-462 FlashCure unit. The non-casting surface of the back mold was exposed to four doses of high intensity UV light totaling approximately 1150 mJ/cm2. The gasket was stripped from the assembly and residual uncured material was wiped from the exposed edge of the lens. An oxygen barrier strip (polyethylene) was wrapped around the edge of the lens. The mold/gasket assembly was exposed to two more doses of high intensity UV light, wherein 575 mJ/cm2 total was directed to the non-casting surface of the front mold. Subsequently, eight more flashes of the UV light were directed to the non-casting surface of the back mold, totaling 2300 mJ/cm2., 291487=An eyeglass lens was successfully cured with ultraviolet light utilizing a xenon flash lamp as a source of activating radiation. The flash lamp used was an Ultra 1800 White Lightning photographic strobe, commercially available from Paul C. Buff Incorporated of Nashville, Tenn. This lamp was modified by replacing the standard borosilicate flash tubes with quartz flash tubes. A quartz flash tube is preferred because some of the ultraviolet light generated by the arc inside the tube tends to be absorbed by borosilicate glass. The strobe possessed two semicircular flash tubes that trigger simultaneously and are positioned to form a ring approximately 73 millimeters in diameter. The hole in the reflector behind the lamps, which normally contains a modeling lamp for photographic purposes, was covered with a flat piece of highly-polished ultraviolet reflective material which is commercially available under the trade name of Alzac from Ultra Violet Process Supply of Chicago, Ill. The power selector switch was set to full power. The ultraviolet energy generated from one flash was measured using an International Light IL 1700 Research Radiometer available from International Light, Incorporated =of Newburyport, Mass. The detector head was an International Light XRL 340 B, which is sensitive to radiation in the 326 nm to 401 nm region. The window of the detector head was positioned approximately 35 mm from the plane of the flash tubes and was approximately centered within the ring formed by the tubes., 460915=The solvent present in the coating composition was allowed to evaporate while rotating the mold for 10 to 15 seconds. The rotation was stopped, and then the coating composition on the mold was cured via totalling exposures of approximately 300 mJ/cm2 of ultraviolet light. The light was provided from a medium pressure mercury vapor lamp contained in the UX-462 FlashCure unit. All light intensity/dosage measurements cited herein were taken with an International Light IL-1400 Radiometer equipped with an XLR-340B Detector Head, both commercially available from International Light, Inc. of Newburyport, Mass. At this point, the spin motor was again engaged and approximately 1.5 to 2.0 grams of additional coating composition was dispensed onto the spinning mold. The solvent of the composition was allowed to evaporate, and the composition was cured in a similar fashion to the first layer of coating composition., 499690=After brushing, a stream of isopropyl alcohol was directed at the surface of the lens, and the rotation was continued for a period of approximately 30 seconds until the lens was dry. The lens was turned over on the stage so that the convex surface of the lens was upward. Then the cleaning procedure was repeated on the convex surface. With the convex surface upward, the lens was dosed with four exposures of ultraviolet light totaling approximately 1150 mJ/cm2. The lens was turned over on the stage so that the concave surface faced upward. The lens was subjected to an additional two exposures totaling 300 mJ/cm2. The lens was removed from the stage and placed in a convection oven at 115\ufffd C. for five minutes. The lens was then removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. At this point, the lens was ready for shaping by conventional means to fit into an eyeglass frame., 338921=According to an embodiment of the invention, a first coating composition, i.e., a polymerizable \u201cprimer\u201d material is passed through a filter and then placed within a mold member having a casting face and a non-casting face. The first coating composition preferably contains a photoinitiator to make it curable upon exposure to ultraviolet light. The mold member may then be spun so that the first composition becomes distributed over the casting face. The mold member is preferably rotated about a substantially vertical axis at a speed between about 750 and about 1000 revolutions per minute. Further, a dispensing device may be used to direct an additional amount of the first composition onto the casting face while the mold member is spinning. The dispensing device preferably moves from the center of the mold member to an edge of the mold member so that the additional amount is directed along a radius of the mold member. Ultraviolet light is preferably directed at the mold member to cure at least a portion of the first composition., 319249=A programmable logic controller 417 may be housed within the control panel. Controller 417 is preferably adapted to independently control operation of the light generators 402 and 404 such that ultraviolet light is directed in a plurality of pulses toward at least one of the mold members. The controller 417 is preferably programmable such that a predetermined time elapses between each of the pulses to optimize the curing cycle. The controller 417 may be adapted to cause the strobes to fire at predetermined times through the curing cycle, thereby controlling the rate of polymerization and exothermic heat generation of the lens forming composition. One programmable logic controller that has been found to perform adequately is the Little Star Microcontroller combined with a Relay Six relay board, both commercially available from Z-World Engineering of Davis, Calif. The strobe firing sequence may be written in Dynamic C programming language. The Ultra 1800 White Lightning photographic strobes, commercially available from Paul C. Buff, Incorporated of Nashville, Tenn., have been found to perform adequately., 446721=A background dye stock solution was prepared by mixing 50 grams of a 422 ppm solution of A241/HDDMA, 50 grams of a 592 ppm solution of Thermoplast Red 454/HDDMA, 50 grams of 490 ppm solution of Zapon Brown 286/HDDMA, 50 grams of 450 ppm solution of Zapon Brown 287/HDDMA, 50 grams of 1110 ppm solution of Oil Soluble Blue II/HDDMA, and 50 grams of a 1110 ppm solution of Thermoplast Blue P/HDDMA, all with 700 grams of PRO-629. The entire mixture was heated to a temperature ranging from about 50\ufffd C. to 60\ufffd C. and subsequently stirred for two hours., 378744=While any number of families of photochromic pigments may be incorporated into the blend of monomers, either individually or in combination, spiropyrans, spironapthoxazines, spiropyridobenzoxazines, spirobenzoxazines, napthopyrans benzopyrans, spiro-oxazines, spironapthopyrans, indolinospironapthoxazines, indolinospironapthopyrans, diarylnapthopyrans, and organometallic materials, such as phenylmercury compounds are of particular interest. A phenylmercury compound available from Marks Polarized Corporation in Hauppauge, N.Y. under the trade name of A241 may be an appropriate organometallic material. The quantity of photochromic pigments present in the lens forming composition is preferably sufficient to provide observable photochromic effect. The amount of photochromic pigments present in the lens forming composition may widely range from about 1 ppm by weight to 5% by weight. In preferred compositions the photochromic pigments are present in ranges from about 30 ppm to 2000 ppm. In the more preferred compositions the photochromic pigments are present in ranges from about 150 ppm to 1000 ppm. The concentration may be adjusted depending upon the thickness of the lens being produced to obtain optimal visible light absorption characteristics., 495759=An ultraviolet light filter was then placed on top of the back mold. The filter was approximately 80 mm in diameter which is the same as the mold diameter. It had a plano configuration with a thickness of 3.1 mm. This filter transmitted approximately 30% of the incident ultraviolet light from the source as measured using the IL 1400 radiometer with a XRL-340B detector head. The filter was taken from a group of previously made filters. The fabrication of these filters was discussed in the Casting A Plastic Lens Containing Photochromic Material Example (see above)., 521566=An ultraviolet light filter was then placed on top of the back mold. The filter was approximately 80 mm in diameter which is the same as the mold diameter. It had a plano configuration with a thickness of 3.1 mm. This filter transmitted approximately 30% of the incident ultraviolet light from the source as measured using the IL 1400 radiometer with a XRL-340B detector head. The filter was taken from a group of previously made filters. The fabrication of these filters was discussed in the Casting A Plastic Lens Containing Photochromic Material Example., 74891=The lens forming composition is preferably continuously exposed to a relatively low intensity ultraviolet light either before, while, or after pulses of relatively high intensity are applied, the relatively low intensity light having an intensity of less than 1000 microwatts/cm2 (and more preferably less than 100 microwatts/cm2, and more preferably still 2-30 microwatts/cm2), as measured on an outside surface of a mold member of the mold cavity. The relatively low intensity light tends to provide a low amount of light to keep the reaction going in a more steady or even manner between pulses., 347932=The solvent present in the Primer was allowed to evaporate off for 8 to 10 seconds during rotation of the mold. The rotation was stopped and the Primer coat which remained on the mold was cured via two exposures to the ultraviolet output from the medium pressure mercury vapor lamp contained in the UX-462 FlashCure unit, totaling approximately 300 mJ/cm2. All light intensity/dosage measurements cited herein were taken with an International Light IL-1400 Radiometer equipped with an XLR-340B Detector Head, both commercially available from International Light, Inc. of Newburyport, Mass., 524454=After brushing, a stream of isopropyl alcohol was directed at the surface of the lens, and the rotation was continued for a period of approximately 30 seconds until the lens was dry. The lens was turned over on the stage so that the convex surface of the lens faced upward. Then the cleaning procedure was repeated on the convex surface. With the convex surface facing upward, the lens was dosed with four exposures of ultraviolet light totaling approximately 1150 mJ/cm2. The lens was turned over on the stage so that the concave surface was upward. The lens was dosed with an additional two exposures totaling 300 mJ/cm2. The lens was removed from the stage and placed in a convection oven at 115\ufffd C. for five minutes. The lens was then removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. At this point the lens was ready for shaping by conventional means to fit into an eyeglass frame., 375460=A preferred ultraviolet photoinitiator is bis(2,6 dimethoxybenzoyl) (2,4,4 trimethyl phenyl) phosphine oxide, commercially available from Ciba Additives in Tarrytown, N.Y. under the trade name of CGI-819. The amount of CGI-819 present in a lens forming composition containing photochromic compounds preferably ranges from about 30 ppm by weight to about 2000 ppm by weight., 345451=0.28% Darocur 1173 (2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propan-1-one) available from Ciba-Geigy., 335932=The assembly was subsequently returned to the UX-462 FlashCure unit and the non-casting surface of the back mold was exposed to four doses of high intensity UV light totaling approximately 1150 mJ/cm2. The gasket was stripped from the assembly and residual uncured material wiped from the exposed edge of the lens. An oxygen barrier strip (polyethylene) was wrapped around the edge of the lens and the mold was exposed to two more doses of high intensity UV light totaling 575 mJ/cm2 to the non-casting surface of the front mold followed by eight more flashes to the non-casting surface of the back mold totaling 2300 mJ/cm2., 207586=A liquid lens forming composition was initially cured in a process and apparatus similar to that specified in Example 1 except for post-cure treatment which was conducted as follows: After the sample was irradiated for 15 minutes, the lens was removed from the FC-104 chamber and then passed through the above-mentioned UVEXS Model 912 curing chamber (see FIG. 10) to receive a dose of about 1500 mJ/cm2 (+/\u2212100 ml) of ultraviolet light per pass. The gasket was then removed from the mold assembly and the edges of the mold were wiped with an absorbent tissue to remove incompletely cured lens forming material proximate the mold edges. A strip of plastic material impregnated with photoinitiator was wrapped around the edges of the molds that were exposed when the gasket was removed. Next, the mold assembly was passed through the UVEXS curing chamber once to expose the front surface of the mold to a dose of about 1500 mJ/cm2 . The mold assembly was then passed through the UVEXS four more times, with the back surface of the mold receiving a dose of about 1500mJ/cm2 per pass. A hot plate was operated such that the surface of the hot plate reached a temperature of 340 degrees F (+/\u221250 degrees F). A conformable \u201cbeanbag\u201d container having a covering made of Nomex\u2122 fabric was placed on the hot plate. The container contained glass beads and was turned over such that the portion of the container that had directly contacted the hot plate (i.e., the hottest portion of the container) faced upward and away from the hot plate. The mold assembly was then placed onto the heated, exposed portion of the container that had been in direct contact with the hot plate. The concave, non-casting face of the mold was placed onto the exposed surface of the container which substantially conformed to the shape of the face. Heat was conducted through the container and the mold member to the lens for 13 minutes.

The rotation was stopped, and then the coating composition present on the mold was cured via two exposures to the ultraviolet output from the medium pressure mercury vapor lamp contained in the UX-462 FlashCure unit, totaling approximately 300 mJ/cm2. All light intensity/dosage measurements cited herein were taken with an International Light IL-1400 Radiometer equipped with an XLR-340B Detector Head, both commercially available from International Light, Inc. of Newburyport, Mass., 496348=The mold/gasket assembly in which the lens forming composition had been placed and which had been covered by the above described filter was then irradiated with four consecutive doses of ultraviolet light totaling approximately 600 mJ/cm2, as measured using the IL-1400 Radiometer equipped with the XLR-340B detector. This measurement was taken at the plane of the mold cavity while no filter or any intervening media was present between the light source and the plane. The mold/gasket assembly was then turned over on the stage so that the front mold was facing upward. The mold/gasket assembly was further rotated 90 degrees around the paraxial axis from its original position. The light filter was then replaced over the front mold. The entire assembly was exposed to two more doses of ultraviolet light totaling approximately 300 mJ/cm2., 377565=Ultraviolet absorbing compounds which may be added to a normally ultraviolet transmissible lens forming composition include 2-(2H benzotriazole-2-yl)-4-(1,1,3,3 tetramethyl butyl) phenol and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, both commercially available from Aldrich Chemical as well as mixtures of 2-[4-((2-hydroxy-3-dodecyloxypropyl)-oxy]-2-2 hydroxyphenyl]-4,6-bis(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine and 2-[4-((2-hydroxy-3-tridecyloxypropyl)-oxy]-2-hydroxyphenyl]-4,6-bis(2,4-dimethylpheyl-1,3,5-triazine commercially available from Ciba Additives under the trade name of Tinuvin 400, mixtures of poly (oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), a-(3-(3-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-5-(1,1 -dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1 -oxopropyl)-w-hydroxy and poly (oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), a-(3-(3-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1 -oxopropyl)-w-(3-(3-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-5-1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-oxopropoxy) commercially available from Ciba Additives under the trade name of Tinuvin 1130. Other UV absorbers may include Tinuvin 328, Tinuvin 900, 2(2 hydroxy-5-methyl phenyl) benzotriazole, ethyl-2-cyano 3,3 diphenyl acrylate, and phenyl salicylate., 469728=The mold/gasket assembly and the filter were then irradiated with four consecutive doses of ultraviolet light totaling approximately 1150 mJ/cm2, as previously measured at the plane of the mold cavity with no filter or any other intervening media between the light source and the plane. The mold/gasket assembly was then turned over on the stage so that the front mold was facing upward. The mold/gasket assembly was further rotated 90 degrees around the paraxial axis from its original position. The light filter was then placed over the front mold. The entire assembly was then exposed to two more doses of ultraviolet light totaling approximately 575 mJ/cm2. The mold/gasket assembly was removed from the curing chamber. The gasket was removed from the molds, and the exposed edge of the lens was wiped to remove any residual liquid. The molds with lens were then placed in a vertical orientation in a rack, and the non-casting faces of both the front and back molds were exposed to ambient room temperature air for a period of approximately ten minutes. At this point, the entire mold assembly was returned to the UX-462 chamber. Then, without the aforementioned light filter in place, the mold assembly was dosed with four exposures totaling 600 mJ/cm2 directed toward the back mold and two exposures totaling 300 mJ/cm2 directed toward the front mold., 380023=In an embodiment, hindered amine light stabilizers may be added to the lens forming composition. It is believed that these materials act to reduce the rate of degradation of the cured polymer caused by exposure to ultraviolet light by deactivating harmful polymer radicals. These compounds may be effective in terminating oxygen and carbon free radicals, and thus interfering with the different stages of auto-oxidation and photo-degradation. A useful hindered amine light stabilizer is bis(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidinyl) sebacate commercially available from Ciba Additives under the trade name of Tinuvin 292. Hindered phenolic anti-oxidants and thermal stabilizers may also be added to a lens forming composition. The hindered phenolic compounds hereof include thiodiethylene bis-(3,5,-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy)hydrocinnamate commercially available from Ciba Additives under the trade name of Irganox 1035 and octadecyl 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxybenzene-propanoate commercially available from Ciba Additives under the trade name of Irganox 1076., 522143=The mold/gasket assembly, containing the lens forming composition was then irradiated with six consecutive doses of ultraviolet light totaling approximately 1725 mJ/cm2, as previously measured using the IL-1400 Radiometer equipped with the XLR-340B detector at the plane of the mold cavity with no filter or any intervening media between the light source and the plane. The mold/gasket assembly was then turned over on the stage so that the front mold was facing upward. The entire assembly was then exposed to six more doses of ultraviolet light totaling approximately 1725 mJ/cm2. The mold/gasket assembly was removed from the curing chamber. The gasket was removed from the molds, and the assembly was placed in a vertical orientation in a rack such that the non-casting faces of both the front and back molds were exposed to ambient room temperature air for a period of approximately ten minutes. At this point, the assembly was returned to the UX-462 chamber and was dosed with four exposures totaling 600 mJ/cm2 directed toward the back mold and four exposures totaling 600 mJ/cm2 directed toward the front mold., 488493=The solvent present in the coating composition was allowed to evaporate off for 10 to 15 seconds while rotating. The rotation was stopped, and then the coating composition present on the mold was cured via two exposures to the ultraviolet output from the medium pressure mercury vapor lamp contained in the UX-462 FlashCure unit, totaling approximately 300 mJ/cm2. AU light intensity/dosage measurements cited herein were taken with an International Light IL-1400 Radiometer equipped with an XLR-340B Detector Head, both commercially available from International Light, Inc. of Newburyport, Mass., 70643=The oxygen barrier may include a flexible, stretchable, self-sealing film that is at least partially transparent to ultraviolet rays. The oxygen barrier may include polyethylene impregnated with a photoinitiator. The film may include a strip of high density polyethylene that is about 0.01-1.0 mm thick, and more preferably about 0.01-0.10 mm thick. Thicker films tend to be less conformable and stretchable. The oxygen barrier may include a plastic film that is less than about 0.025 mm thick. (e.g., about 0.0127 mm thick) and that was made by (a) immersing or running a plastic film in or through a solution comprising a photoinitiator and an etching agent (b) removing the plastic film from the solution, and (c) drying the plastic film. A surface on the plastic film may be chemically etched prior to or while immersing the plastic film in the solution., 540320=Photoinitiators which have utility in the present invention have been described in previous embodiments. Ultraviolet light absorbing compounds which may be added to a normally ultraviolet transmissible lens forming composition have also been described in previous embodiments. The quantity of photochromic pigments present in the lens forming composition is preferably sufficient to provide observable photochromic effect. The amount of photochromic pigments present in the lens forming composition may widely range from about 1 ppm by weight to 1-5% by weight. In preferred compositions the photochromic pigments are present in ranges from about 30 ppm to 2000 ppm. In the more preferred compositions the photochromic pigments are present in ranges from about 150 ppm to 1000 ppm. The concentration may be adjusted depending upon the thickness of the lens being produced to obtain optimal visible light absorption characteristics.}",
