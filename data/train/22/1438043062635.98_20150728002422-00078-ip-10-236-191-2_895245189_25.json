    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Dixie is awesome for students who live in St. George(or near by) who don't wish to go to a costly large university and just want to stay local. This school is also great for those that wish to get into the Nursing field because of the school's amazing Nursing program. Another awesome part of the medical programs at the school is if you wish to transfer to say the University of Utah, acceptance of those students are way high, because the University of Utah knows of Dixie's excellent teaching and wish for those students to come. The list goes on and on. Tips for prospective students For tips, make sure to go to Dixie events and other out of class activities, it is really the best way to get the best out of your college experience, you can always have fun at Dixie, you just need to put yourself out their to see it. Bang for the buck The amazing thing about Dixie State College is for the fact of it being so cheap as a College.
