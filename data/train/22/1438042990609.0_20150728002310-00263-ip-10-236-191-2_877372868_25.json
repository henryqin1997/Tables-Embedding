    "textAfterTable": "By the numbers A look at a few numbers from A&M's 38-30 win over Utah State. 4A&M true freshman receiver Uzoma Nwachukwu scored four touchdowns on four touches Saturday, three through the air and one on a 39-yard reverse. It broke the freshman record that was previously held by Leeland McElroy who had three in against Missouri on the same date in 1992. 3 Nwachukwu's three receiving touchdowns matched the school record for receiving touchdowns in a game, which is shared by three players. Chris Cole was the last to do it in 1998 against North Texas. 300A&M junior quarterback Jerrod Johnson threw for 322 yards Saturday, which is the fourth 300-yard effort of his career. Johnson is the first Aggie to ever achieve the 300-yard mark four times. He's also just the second to do it in back-to-back games, joining Reggie McNeal who did it against SMU and Texas State in 2005. 400Johnson finished with 400 yards of total offense. He had 406 against New Mexico, putting him into the 400-yard club in back-to-back game with just one other Aggie players - Reggie McNeal - who did it against SMU and Texas State in 2005.",
