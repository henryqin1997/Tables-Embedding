Both are specified in RFC 1334 and are supported on synchronous and asynchronous interfaces.

These lists are used with the arap authentication line configuration command. Configuring ARAP Authentication Using AAA Allocating additional background processes can be expensive. You should configure the minimum number",
    "textAfterTable": "What to Do Next The list-name is any character string used to name the list you are creating. The method argument refers to the actual list of methods the authentication algorithm tries, in the sequence entered. To create a default list that is used when a named list is not specified in the arap authentication command, use the default keyword followed by the methods you want to use in default situations. The additional methods of authentication are used only if the previous method returns an error, not if it fails. To specify that the authentication should succeed even if all methods return an error, specify none as the final method in the command line. Note Because none allows all users logging in to be authenticated, it should be used as a backup method of authentication. The following table lists the supported login authentication methods.
