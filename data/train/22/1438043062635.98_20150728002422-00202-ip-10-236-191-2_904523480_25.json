            "Black Hawk has their own police department. I'm not worried about going to school at all because it's a safe school.",
            "On campus there is a club that is called the Student Wellness Club. This club is all about promoting healthier ways to eat and exercising. We meet once a month and in November we are selling coupon books, there is a five week yoga class every Monday night. We also help out with the Hawk Hustle which is a 5K race. For my College Experience and Success course one of the assignments was to attend a club meeting. I probably wouldn't have joined a club if I didn't have to do an assignment on it. I'm so glad that I did join the Student Wellness Club. Dr. Collins is the professor in charge of the club and she's amazing!",
            "In the Hawk's Nest there is an event about everyday. For Halloween there was a costume contest and there is always food and drinks and prizes.",
            "There is a Subway in the Hawk's Nest and that is pretty good. There is also a lot of vending machines around campus that has many beverages to chose from and a lot of tasty snacks. The Hawk Hub is the bookstore on campus and they have everything from Poptarts to K-cups.",
            "I don't live in the Villas on campus, I hear they are very nice though!",
            "I never studied in high school and when I came to Black Hawk I realized that I had to study in order to actually do well on tests. For my first semester I've been only taking introduction courses that aren't actually giving me any credit. Even though I'm not getting any credit for them I'm still learning a lot. In my English class I'm learning about sentence structure, which seems like something I should have learned in high school. In high school I was never taught the structure of a sentence and coming into this class I'm learning so much and I am actually enjoying learning about it. In this semester I am also taking a math class. My professor is so funny and always has the class laughing at his stupid jokes. I am not a math person, but this semester my math class is my favorite class. The work is hard and there is a lot of it but I'm learning so much and I am having fun doing it.",
            "Always come prepared for class with all your materials. Make sure to read the chapter before class. When the instructor is lecturing be sure to take notes on what they are saying. Ask questions when you don't understand.",
            "The instructors are great and really put the time and effort into helping your succeed. The campus is not too big and it is easy to find everything around the campus. The students in my classes always try to help each other out to find the answers, especially in math!"

Dr. Collins is the professor in charge of the club and she's amazing!, 112180=Students who arent a morning person or people who are too busy in the morning, Black Hawk offers a flexible class schedule that runs from Monday through Friday from 8:00 until 8:00 at night, 94682=winners in the classroom, the 2009 softball team was awarded the President\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2?s Award spring semester with a grade point average of 3.6/4.0. That makes them runner-up in the nation for team GPA, 98120=At Black Hawk College there is no dorms, because it is a community college. There is, however, apartments right next to campus called The Villas that just opened in 2013 that are a very affordable option for students to stay close to campus., 95376=Originally established as Moline Community College by the Moline School Board in 1946, the college was later named Black Hawk College in 1961. In 1965, the college was incorporated into the state\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2?s system of higher education, and in 1967 East Campus operations started at the Kewanee National Guard Armory., 67094=YES YES YES. BHC charges only $95 a credit hour, which is a great bargain! You can attend a full class schedule of 15 credits for only about $1700, which includes all fees. I think it is definitely well-worth the money!, 128992=Again this is for the ADN program only. Classes are appropriately challenging, with a focus on practical skill as well as theoretical knowledge. They're also building a new Health Sciences building that is scheduled to open in Fall 2015., 94035=Originally established as Moline Community College by the Moline School Board in 1946, the college was later named Black Hawk College in 1961.

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students All students, I have students of all shapes and sizes and ages in my classes, and they gel well together! There are so many different opinions and you really learn how other people think and how to respect their opinions and work together. Also, for those who are undecided on what they want to do. There are so many opportunities! Tips for prospective students Register for classes as soon as you can & as much as you may hate it, talk to an advisor. It is a pain, but it's worth it. If you're not sure take classes from the Associates sheet, they're just basic classes. Also, be sure and take one class you're really interested, even if it's not on the Associates sheet. You'll fnd out what you love! Bang for the buck Very reasonably priced! And many different scholarship opportunities, I've received one each year. Sometimes they're not much, but anything helps! Am enjoying being here I like college, the schedule is the best part! You can set up your schedule so you can just take Tuesday/ Thursday class, or all online, or all night classes. A great amount of flexibility. Am learning a lot",
