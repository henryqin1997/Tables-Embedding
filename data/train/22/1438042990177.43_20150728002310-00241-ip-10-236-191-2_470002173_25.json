The two-step grafting process was used in both cases, as described in Table 3. Comparison of the carbonyl regions of these two figures shows a clear distinction between the two samples. The intensity of the carbonyl peak around 1660 cm\u22121 is much higher when heparin is incorporated into the grafting solution, as compared to grafting with NVP alone under similar conditions, indicating that efficient grafting of PVP-co-heparin is obtained., 96358=Only a few attempts have been reported in literature which employed plasma treatment combined with other treatments in order to induce grafting [Bamford et al, Polymer., Vol. 2, p. 277 (1961); Bazkin et al, J. Bioeng., Vol. 2, p. 527 (1978)]. Generally, these methods are based on decomposition of surface peroxides to radicals by heat treatment which initiates graft polymerization. However, heating up to 135\ufffd C. was sometimes required [Bamford, supra]. This temperature is beyond the glass transition temperature of a large number of polymers. Therefore, such a process cannot be used for surface grafting, especially for biomedical devices such as acrylic intraocular lenses, where shape and dimensional stability are very important. In 1971, Bradley and Fales reported another process based on the plasma-induced graft copolymerization of acrylic acid onto synthetic fibers [Bradley et al, Chemtech., p. 232, April 1984]. Grafting was induced by the surface radicals present on the plasma treated fibers. The grafting yields were generally relatively low and no grafting of other monomers was attempted. In contrast, the combined use of GDP surface modification with gamma graft surface modification represents a novel method for the preparation of improved polymer graft surfaces on polymers, metals and ceramics., 237718=One-piece PMMA intraocular lens (IOL) implants with 6 mm diameter optics and 13 mm overall diameter are modified by using the two-step (pre-soak) process with NVP pre-soak and 0.1 Mrad grafting followed by 0.05 Mrad grafting in an aqueous monomer-biofunctional molecule solution containing 10% monomer plus 5% of a 1:2:1 ratio of heparin/HEMA-PL/prednisone mix. The resulting surface modified IOLs exhibit very low inflammatory cell adhesion post-operatively in a rabbit anterior chamber implant model even using 100 mg of injected autologous rabbit lens cortex to induce an acute inflammatory reaction. Similarly, improved results are observed for silicone IOLs surface modified using the above biofunctional molecule-monomer mixture., 84791=(e) Degassing: Removal of oxygen from the graft solutions by a vacuum and/or an inert gas (e.g., argon purging) can have an important effect: lower total doses are required (practical grafting at less than 0.1 Mrad) and oxygen degassing can have a significant effect on Mw and % conversion of monomer. For example, with degassing, good grafting of PVP on polypropylene (PP) is achieved at 0.05 Mrad and 10% NVP (C.A. 15\ufffd). Without degassing, little grafting occurs under these conditions. Oxygen degassing can be important to hydrophilic surface modification grafting where the substrate polymer is PP, PVDF or PDMSO. It has been found that graft polymerization is inefficient when using these materials as substrates in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen degassing is also beneficial for PMMA and PC substrates in that much lower radiation doses (0.01-0.15 Mrad) become effective compared with grafting these polymers in the presence of oxygen., 161653=PVP and DMA Hydrograft\u2122 matrices are also readily prepared with 0.1-50 wt % basement membrane and serum proteins (albumin, collagen, laminin, fibronectin) on PUR, silicone and fluorocarbon polymer substrates. Using the plasma/gamma process, metal endoluminal stent materials (stainless steel and tantalum) were also readily surface modified with hydrophilic polymer surfaces containing heparin, laminin, albumin and collagen and exhibited lower platelet adhesion (non-thrombogenic properties) in vitro and using A-V shunt tests in canines., 187170=Albumin containing grafts show peaks at 1652 cm\u22121 (b), the amide carbonyl assigned to albumin, and a peak at 1543 cm\u22121 (c), an N-H bending peak also assigned to albumin., 239316=Nylon vascular catheters are surface modified with a 12% aqueous KSPA monomer solution containing 2% heparin and gentamicin in a 1:1 ratio. A two-step process is used with NVP at 0.1 Mrad in the first step and the above KSPA/heparin/gentamicin mix in the second step. The resulting highly hydrophilic catheter surfaces greatly reduce vascular endothelium damage during insertion and removal, are much easier (lower friction) to insert and remove, exhibit very low thrombogenicity and have anti-bacterial properties to minimize the risk of infectious complications, as compared to conventional nylon catheters. Similar biofunctional hydrophilic surface modifications are readily prepared on polyurethane, fluorocarbon, polyvinyl chloride and silicone catheter (and balloon) surfaces with similar major improvements in clinically important properties., 186959=The expanded region of the PVP-g-PMMA shows two peaks, one at 1726 cm\u22121 (a) and a second at 1662 cm\u22121 (b). They are the PMMA ester and PVP amide carbonyls, respectively., 221185=FT-IR/ATR analysis for PVP/GS-g-PMMA exhibited an absorption shoulder at 1662 cm\u22121 (d) which is characteristic of the shifted carbonyl from gentamicin sulfate., 51905=This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser.

No. 5,376,400., 211572=FT-IR/ATR spectra for a three-step PVP/CS-g-PMMA has peaks at 1726 cm\u22121 (a) and 1685 cm\u22121 (b) and a shoulder at 1664 cm\u22121 (c). The PMMA ester carbonyl is at 1726 cm\u22121 (a), but the peak at 1685 cm\u22121 (b) is due to the chondroitin sulfate in the Hydrograft\u2122., 85763=(f) Graft Thickness: Surface grafts less than 100-200 \u212b, although non-adhesive and hydrophilic, are useful but may exhibit somewhat less mechanical \u201csoftness\u201d or compliant gel-like surfaces than thicker coatings for reduced tissue-contact trauma. Graft coatings greater than ca. 300-500 \u212b (or 0.03-0.05 microns) up to 50 microns or more are probably more desirable for many applications as long as they are smooth, uniform, optically clear for optic surfaces, and quickly hydrated., 59459=In U.S. Pat. No. 4,806,382, issued Feb. 21, 1989, there are described improved methods for producing hydrophilic, gamma irradiation induced polymerized and chemically grafted coatings on ocular implants constructed of a variety of polymeric materials, which methods overcome the above-noted difficulties and disadvantages., 171205=FT-IR analysis of (CMC-co-PVP)-g-PMMA and (HA-co-PVP)-g-PMMA samples (FIGS. 9 and 10) reveals an increased intensity of the absorption bands characteristic of the CMC and HA in the grafts compared to PMMA-g-PVP samples. In addition, a broad hydroxyl (OH) absorption in the region of 3300-2900 cm\u22121 was also found. (HA-co-PVP)-g-PMMA samples (FIG. 10) showed an increase in the carbonyl peak at 1650 cm\u22121.}",
