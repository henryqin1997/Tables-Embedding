            "Lots of clubs and activities to name.",
            "If you are a hard core studyier, the dog house is for you. Its open 24 hours. There are computers there and a nice lobby to study.",
            "We have a bowling alley in the PITT and a movie theather in the bulldog house.",
            "I love my HBCU. You will learn how to network with people. The other students on campus are you lifeline to everything. People there are very friendly and are always willing to help.",
            "There is a lot of functions that are constantly going on campus and off. Sometimes you will be notified by e-mail but mainly its by hear say. Some things you can do is hang around the plaza after hours or go to the bulldog house which is open 24hrs.",
            "Food is great! We have several different places on campus where you can eat food. Only down side is most of the food is unhealthy and very greasy.",
            "Sharing rooms can be hard but if you have problems with your roomate or suitemates, they will have no problem removing them or placing you in a room by yourself. Roomate contracts are usually made to try to cut down on conflicts. Conflicts are usually resloved with a RA. The dorms are fairly nice looking.",
            "Teachers are fair. I have heard of students challenging professors on their grades.",
            "Stay on top of financial aid. Do not be afraid to talk to other students on campus because they will tell you a lot of things that the staff sometimes don't. If transferring, make sure all of your classes will transfer before coming. If you get here and you are told that a class/classes did not transfer, go to your department head or dean to make sure.(transfer students seem to have to most problems with classes coming in.)",
            "Everyone is family at SCState. Everyone, faculty and students, work together. Teachers will do what they can to help you succeed."
