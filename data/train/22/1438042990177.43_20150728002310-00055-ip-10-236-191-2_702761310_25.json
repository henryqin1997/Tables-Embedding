Powerful 3D Visualization Complete 3D visualization of your entire modeling area. Sources, buildings, and concentration and/or deposition contour results are displayed in context with the surrounding terrain. Export to Google Earth\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 This exciting feature allows you to export your buildings, sources, receptors and contours into Google Earth giving you a more realistic image of where your pollutants will impact surrounding areas. New Project Wizard The New Project Wizard allows you to quickly and easily set up a new project in AERMOD View. You can setup your project by specifying a reference point in Latitude/Longitude, UTM, or any other local coordinate system. AERMOD Parallel at No Extra Cost Included in the package, at no extra cost, is AERMOD MPI, Lakes Environmental parallel version of AERMOD. This will significantly cut down on model run times, while still giving the high quality results you expect from AERMOD View. Professional Printing Templates Take advantage of the ready-to-use printout template. You can include your company logo, project",
