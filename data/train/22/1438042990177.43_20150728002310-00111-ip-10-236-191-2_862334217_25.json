    "textBeforeTable": "Alabama's penchant for playing close conference games was further galvanized Saturday in a thrilling 27-24 win over Ole Miss that came down to an overturned official ruling in the final seconds. Other than a relatively handy 24-10 win over Vanderbilt, Alabama's has nipped Arkansas by three and lost to Georgia in overtime. But it's certainly not a trend reserved for 2007. This week, we lead off the Sunday Rewind with a look at Alabama's Southeastern Conference results dating back to the 2005 Ole Miss game, and the narrow margins by which most were decided. Remarkably, SEC opponents have averaged 19.4 points per game in that stretch, while Alabama has averaged 19.3. One more nail-biter Alabama 27, Ole Miss 24: John Parker Wilson - 26 of 40, 265 yards \u0085 DJ Hall - 11 catches, 140 yards \u0085 Wallace Gilberry - 5 tackles, 3 TFLs, 2 sacks, 1 PBU. The Sunday Rewind is a weekly collection of notes and quotes from the Alabama football game of the weekend.
