What makes this unsual is that the kids get to sleep in the dorms overnight and that an improv-show come to the campus and does a hilarious show for the students., 206039=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 17971=Coming from California the transition from state to state was rough, but Concordia really helped me become involved not only in the school and my community but it also allowed me to quickly get comfortable with the city. Concordia is a small school (roughly 2500-3000 students) so getting to know people was incredibly easy! Though it rains a lot that never stops me or anyone i know from having a great time. Concordia is located in between PSU, UP, PCC, and several other schools within a 25 mile radius so new people are always around and coming up to the school whether it be for sporting events or just to visit. Also the school is a 5-10 minute drive from downtown so even though the school itself is in the suburbs entertainment is never far, plus the school always has discounted events (everything from Halloween Corn Mazes to Portland Trailblazer games) going on with free transportation provided!, 139413=The food is very good, and they strive to make it as healthy and organic as possible. There are multiple places on campus to get food or drinks including the C-store, the dining hall, and Cafe 1905, the coffee shop., 6109=I think this school is great for people who love having a smaller community and truly getting to know your teachers and classmates throughout your whole college experience. This school was just ranked in 2010 as the number one university out of the nation for it's community service! There are many opportunities to give back and this school shows that!}",
