    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{515620=For the Portland Cement NESHAP and NSPS, we estimated the emission reductions that will occur due to the implementation of the final emission limits. EPA estimated emission reductions based on both the control technologies selected by the engineering analysis and the ISIS model. These emission reductions are based on the estimated kiln population in 2013., 154401=As noted above, we are taking into account operating variability of the best performing kilns, or in the case of new source MACT the single best controlled kiln, in assessing their performance (i.e., both in determining which performers are best, and calculating what their performance is). When we calculated the UPL with 99 percent confidence for the best performing sources (or in the case of new source MACT the best controlled single source), we calculated a mercury floor of 55 lb/MM tons clinker for existing sources and 21 lb/MM tons clinker for new sources. We chose a 30-day averaging period for the mercury emission limit. As noted above, the use of a 30-day average (as opposed to hourly or daily averages) tends to reduce variability, and also best reflects the nature of the data from which the floor was derived and assures that several operating cycles of raw mill on and off are included in each average. Id. at 21144., 270341=Periods of startup, normal operations, and shutdown are all predictable and routine aspects of a source's operations. In the proposed rule, EPA expressed the view that there are different modes of operation for any stationary source, and that these modes generally include startup, normal operations, shutdown, and malfunctions. 74 FR at 21162. However, after considering the issue of malfunctions more carefully, EPA believes that malfunctions are distinguishable from startup, shutdown and normal operations. Malfunction is defined as a \u201csudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner * * *\u201d (40 CFR 63.2). EPA has determined that malfunctions should not be viewed as a distinct operating mode or condition and, therefore, any emissions that occur at such times do not need to be factored into development of CAA section 112(d) standards, which, once promulgated, apply at all times. In Mossville Environmental Action Now v. EPA, 370 F.3d 1232, 1242 (DC Cir. 2004), the court upheld as reasonable standards that had factored in variability of emissions under all operating conditions. However, nothing in section 112(d) or in caselaw requires that EPA anticipate and account for the innumerable types of potential malfunction events in setting emission standards. See, Weyerhaeuser v Costle, 590 F.2d 1011, 1058 (DC Cir. 1978) (\u201dIn the nature of things, no general limit, individual permit, or even any upset provision can anticipate all upset situations. After a certain point, the transgression of regulatory limits caused by \u2018uncontrollable acts of third parties,\u2019 such as strikes, sabotage, operator intoxication or insanity, and a variety of other eventualities, must be a matter for the administrative exercise of case-by-case enforcement discretion, not for specification in advance by regulation.\u201d), 888092=(d) The compliance date for new sources with the PM, mercury, THC, and HCl emissions limits in \u00a7 63.1343(b) is November 8, 2010 or startup, whichever is later., 776331=12.Section 63.1341 is amended by adding definitions for \u201cAffirmative defense,\u201d \u201cClinker,\u201d \u201cCrusher,\u201d \u201cEnclosed storage pile,\u201d \u201cInactive clinker pile,\u201d \u201cNew source,\u201d \u201cOperating day,\u201d \u201cSorbent,\u201d \u201cTotal organic HAP\u201d and \u201cTotally enclosed conveying system transfer point\u201d in alphabetic order, and revising the definition of \u201cKiln\u201d to read as follows:, 774175=11.Section 63.1340 is revised to read as follows:, 489448=Response: EPA disagrees with the industry commenter that the Agency is under no obligation to set standards for SO 2 as evidenced by the lack of any SO 2 limits previously or the infrequent need for scrubbers (5 out of 20 new kilns expected to need scrubbers). The absence of SO 2 limits in the NSPS previously was due to the lack of a demonstrated add-on control technology applied to cement kilns during EPA's last review of the NSPS in 1988. Since then, wet scrubbers have been installed on no less than five kilns and operate continuously. Other scrubbers, dry and wet, are installed on other kilns and operate as needed. In reference to the industry commenters' observations regarding permitted kilns in the RBLC database, EPA notes that three kilns for which scrubbers are reported as an add-on control device have permit limits far in excess of the NSPS SO 2 limits indicating a clear need for national standards for SO 2 emissions from cement kilns. Furthermore, controlling SO 2 emissions will control emissions of condensable fine particulate matter, leading to very significant environmental benefits. See Table 13 in Section VI. Control is consequently in keeping with the ultimate goals of the Act in general and section 111 in particular: protecting and enhancing the Nation's air quality. See Asarco v. EPA, 578 F. 2d at 327., 287947=Finally, the NO X limit is based on a 30-day averaging period to be consistent with the averaging periods for other regulated kiln pollutants, and to allow for averaging of raw mill on and off emissions. See 74 FR at 21144. Compared to other averaging options (hourly or daily), this longer averaging time allows additional operating flexibility to meet the limit., 807766=(1) Procedures for proper operation and maintenance of the affected source and air pollution control devices in order to meet the emission limits and operating limits of \u00a7\u00a7 63.1343 through 63.1348;, 872124=(ii) Each bag leak detection system must be installed, operated, calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations and in accordance with the guidance provided in EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997., 576444=When characterizing uncertainty in the PM-mortality relationship, EPA has historically presented a sensitivity analysis applying alternate assumed thresholds in the PM concentration-response relationship. In its synthesis of the current state of the PM science, EPA's 2009 Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) for Particulate Matter concluded that a no-threshold log-linear model most adequately portrays the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship. In the RIA accompanying this rule, rather than segmenting out impacts predicted to be associated levels above and below a \u201cbright line\u201d threshold, EPA includes a \u201clowest-measured-level (LML)\u201d that illustrates the increasing uncertainty that characterizes exposure attributed to levels of PM 2.5 below the LML for each study. Figures provided in the RIA show avoided PM mortality impacts predicted relative to the baseline PM 2.5 levels experienced by the population receiving the PM 2.5 mortality benefit, as well as the lowest air quality levels measured in each of the epidemiology cohort studies. This information allows readers to determine the portion of PM-related mortality benefits occurring above or below the LML of each study; in general, our confidence in the size of the estimated reduction PM 2.5-related premature mortality decreases in areas where annual mean PM 2.5 levels are further below the LML in the cohort studies. Using the Pope et al. (2002) study, about 94 percent occur among populations with baseline exposure to annual mean PM 2.5 levels at or above 7.5 \u03bcg/m [3] . Using the Laden et al. (2006) study, about 58 percent occur among populations with baseline exposure to annual mean PM 2.5 levels at or above 10 \u03bcg/m [3] . While the LML analysis provides some insight into the level of uncertainty in the estimated PM mortality benefits, EPA does not view the LML as a threshold and continues to quantify PM-related mortality impacts using a full range of modeled air quality concentrations., 942009=52. In June 2009, EPA's Office of Air and Radiation revised the VSL used in air regulations to be consistent with the estimate used by the rest of the agency. Until updated guidance is available, EPA determined that a single peer-reviewed estimate applied consistently across the agency best reflects the advice it has received., 209246=As we noted in the proposed rule, as a general matter, CAA section 112(d) requires MACT standards at least as stringent as the MACT floor to be set for all HAP emitted from major sources. However, CAA section 112(d)(4) provides that for HAP with established health thresholds, EPA has the discretionary authority to consider such health thresholds with an ample margin of safety when establishing emission standards under CAA section 112(d). This provision is intended to allow EPA to establish emission standards other than technology-based MACT standards in cases where a less stringent emission standard will still ensure that the health threshold will not be exceeded, with an ample margin of safety. In order to exercise this discretion, EPA must first conclude that the HAP at issue has an established health threshold and must then provide for an ample margin of safety when considering the health threshold to set an emission standard. We discussed this issue at length in the recent proposed Industrial Boiler MACT. See 75 FR at 32020-33 (June 4, 2010) (declining to propose a risk-based standard for HCl emissions)., 94705=EPA has established two separate dockets for these actions: Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2007-0877 for the amendments to the NSPS and Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0051 for the amendments to the NESHAP.

Publicly available docket materials are available either electronically in http://www.regulations.gov or in hard copy at the EPA Docket Center, Standards of Performance for Portland Cement Plants Docket, EPA West, Room 3334, 1301 Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC. The Public Reading Room is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. The telephone number for the Public Reading Room is (202) 566-1744, and the telephone number for the Docket Center is (202) 566-1742., 588002=The information requirements in the final amendments to subpart F have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The Information Collection Request (ICR) document prepared by EPA has been assigned EPA ICR number 2307.01., 652321=(d) As of December 31, 2011 and within 60 days after the date of completing each performance evaluation or test, as defined in \u00a7 63.2, conducted to demonstrate compliance with this subpart, you must submit the relative accuracy test audit data and performance test data, except opacity data, to EPA by successfully submitting the data electronically to EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) by using the Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/ert_tool.html/)., 380173=NIST Certification\u2014In mercury CEMS certification requirements outlined in Performance Specification (PS)-12A, it states that all calibration and span gases must be NIST certified. The draft protocols were just released by NIST in July 2009. The major vendors of mercury CEMS are just now advertising NIST-certified calibration sources. Therefore, none of the mercury CEMS that have been previously installed are certified. NIST does not currently directly certify oxidized mercury calibrations. The Interim EPA Traceability Protocols now in place provide for certification of evaporative generators by certification of the individual components of the calibrator. Therefore, the language used in Section 7.0 that refers to a NIST trace oxidized mercury calibrator needs to be clarified or changed., 809955=(2) Opacity compliance. If you are subject to the limitations on opacity under \u00a7 63.1345, you must demonstrate initial compliance with the opacity emissions standards by using the performance test methods and procedures in \u00a7 63.1349(b)(2). The maximum 6-minute average opacity exhibited during the performance test period must be used to determine whether the affected source is in initial compliance with the standard., 605458=Subject to the Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000) EPA may not issue a regulation that has Tribal implications, that imposes substantial direct compliance costs, and that is not required by statute, unless the Federal government provides the funds necessary to pay the direct compliance costs incurred by Tribal governments, or EPA consults with Tribal officials early in the process of developing the regulation and develops a Tribal summary impact statement., 819171=(3) Opacity compliance. If you are subject to the limitations on opacity under \u00a7 63.1345, you must demonstrate continuous compliance with the opacity emissions standards by using the monitoring methods and procedures in \u00a7 63.1350(f)., 374926=Response: EPA disagrees. An Upper Tolerance Limit is ordinarily utilized for large data sets and is intended to assure that predicted values are lower than a single highest observation. R. (Gibbons, Statistical Tolerance Limits for Ground-Water Monitoring,Vol. 29, No. 4, Ground Water, July-August, 1991) This methodology is intended to produce values that do not underestimate variability but for this reason tends to produce inflated predictions when applied to data sets containing multiple observations, which is the case for the MACT pools for each HAP in this rulemaking. This methodology would therefore overestimate performers' variability as applied in this rulemaking and EPA is therefore not utilizing it. EPA understands that they no longer regard use of UTL statistical methodology as necessitated here., 247233=Industry commenters also maintained that regulation of open storage piles would violate a 2001 settlement agreement between EPA and the industry in which EPA agreed that the 1999 rule did not apply to fugitive emission sources. But nothing in that settlement agreement prevents EPA from amending its regulations if it is appropriate to do so (nor could EPA legally bind itself in such a way). The agreement in fact states that \u201c[n]othing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or modify EPA's discretion to alter, amend, or revise, or to promulgate regulations that supersede, the regulations identified in section III of this Agreement.\u201d Consequently, EPA's action today properly amends the current regulation, and does not violate any provisions of the settlement agreement., 321830=Some industry commenters (2845, 2910) stated that EPA's previous use of a pollutant-by-pollutant analysis was based on authorities not applicable to the CAA. EPA attempted to defend its practice of establishing pollutant-by-pollutant MACT standards by citing Chemical Mfr. Ass'n. v EPA, 870 F.2d 177, 239 (1989), clarified 885 F.2d 253, 264 (5th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 910, (1990), a case where the Court held that, under the CWA, best available technology (BAT) referred to the single best-performing plant on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis., 382643=EPA reported in 1997 on an experiment where CEMS were installed on a cement kiln burning hazardous waste. The Agency found substantial problems regarding mercury CEMS measurement accuracy and precision, deciding not to require Mercury CEMS at cement plants. The industry commenter stated that the primary issue is whether there is a NIST traceable standard that can be used to calibrate the unit. Because compliance is based on the production rate and on using a 30-day average, it is difficult to know what range to calibrate these units., 919227=2. Since its publication in the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy in 1999, EPA has amended the area source category list several times., 128682=We proposed the current review of the Portland Cement Plant NSPS on June 16, 2008. We received a total of 46 comments from the Portland cement industry, environmental groups, State environmental agencies and others during the comment period. This final rule reflects our consideration of all the comments we received. Detailed responses to the comments not included in this preamble are contained in the Summary of Public Comments and Responses document which is included in the docket for this rulemaking., 526862=Waste collected in the polishing baghouse associated with ACI that might be added for mercury or THC control cannot be recycled to the kiln and will be disposed of as solid waste. An estimated 122,000 tpy of solid waste will be generated from the use of ACI systems on existing kilns. A typical new kiln subject to new source mercury standards equipped with an ACI system will be expected to generate 1,800 tons of solid waste per kiln or, assuming all 16 of the kilns subject to new source standards will add ACI systems, about 35,000 tpy in the year 2013., 534171=In a separate analysis performed using the ISIS model, we input into ISIS the baseline and controlled emissions rates for each pollutant, along with the maximum percent reduction achievable for a particular control technology, and allowed ISIS to base the control required on optimizing total production costs. In addition, the ISIS model accounts for normal kiln retirements that will occur even in the absence of any regulatory action (i.e., as new kilns come on-line, older, less efficient and more costly to operate kilns are retired). In the first cost analysis, total national annual costs assume that all kilns currently operating continue to operate while 20 new kilns come on-line. In the ISIS model, the two highest mercury emitting kilns requiring a 98+ percent mercury control are assumed to shut down in 2013 because no single mercury control applied to these kilns can meet a 98+ percent mercury reduction., 222886=Although the PCA analysis did not include an assessment of potential environmental effects, for the 2006 final Portland cement rule, EPA conducted its own analysis of potential effects of cement kilns' HCl emissions to wildlife, aquatic life, and other natural resources. The Agency concluded at the time that acute and chronic exposures to expected HCl concentration around cement kilns are not expected to result in adverse environmental toxicity effects. Id. at 76529. EPA accordingly declined to establish any standard for HCl., 352429=Response: EPA discussed this issue at some length at proposal. See 74 FR at 21149. The problem with equating best performance with performance of pollution control alone is that it ignores the contribution of raw materials and fuels to HAP emissions. Basing standards exclusively on performance of control technology is legally permissible when the control technology is the sole factor influencing performance, which is not the case here. National Lime, 233 F. 3d at 633-34. EPA thus is not adopting these industry commenters' approach. See previous response as well., 242730=We agree that these operations do emit HAP and that regulation of these sources is necessary. See National Lime, 233 F. 3d at 640 (upholding EPA position that de minimis exceptions are not to be read into the MACT standard setting process). Because the emissions in question are fugitive dust for which measurement is not feasible since (by definition) the emissions are not emitted through a conveyance or other device which allows their measurement (see section 112 (h)(1) and (2)(A)), we are adopting the work practice standards and opacity emissions limits contained in Rule 1156 as amended by the South Coast Air Quality Management District on March 6, 2009 and incorporating them into this rule. There are only two plants which EPA can state definitively have open storage piles and are complying with Rule 1156, so these existing regulatory standards would constitute a floor level of control (and EPA does not believe beyond-the-floor controls are needed, since utilizing some type of enclosure should well control fugitive emissions). A summary of the requirements are as follows:, 841270=K = conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (454 g/lb)., 149240=i. Floor Determination. We proposed mercury emissions limits of 43 lb/million (MM) tons clinker for existing sources and 14 lb/MM tons clinker for new sources. The proposed floor was based on 30 days of data on all kiln inputs for 89 kilns. See 74 FR at 21142-43. For all kilns but the five equipped with wet scrubbers, emissions were assumed to equal the total mass of mercury fed to each kiln. Scrubber-equipped kilns were considered to emit all mercury minus an assumed amount representing the average performance of the wet scrubbers. For kilns that waste cement kiln dust (CKD), the mercury component of the CKD was subtracted from inputs to calculate emissions. Id. By conducting a total mass balance for mercury and then assuming that all mercury inputted is emitted (minus conservatively estimated removals for scrubber usage and dust wastage), EPA made a near worst case assumption as to kilns' mercury emission levels. The kilns were then ranked from best to worst based on the extrapolated mercury emissions, normalized to clinker production. EPA further proposed that no beyond the floor standard was appropriate for either existing or new sources. Id. at 21149., 378769=Industry commenter 2855 stated that there is no legitimate technical basis on which to establish detailed performance specifications or quality assurance (QA) requirements for these CEMS. There is no legitimate technical basis to conclude that these CEMS could meet such requirements over any extended period when installed and operated at a cement plant. The industry commenter recommended that EPA evaluate the performance of mercury CEMS at cement kiln systems and acquire the information necessary to serve as the basis for technical specifications and requirements. After such information is available and analyzed, EPA should re-propose appropriate and demonstrated performance specifications and quality assurance procedures for mercury CEMS to monitor kiln and kiln/in-line raw mill mercury emissions., 821133=(5)(i) Activated carbon injection compliance. If activated carbon injection is used and you are subject to a D/F emission limitation under \u00a7 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate continuous compliance with the activated carbon injection rate operating limits specified in \u00a7 63.1346 by installing, operating, and maintaining a continuous monitor to record the rate of activated carbon injection that meets the requirements of \u00a7 63.1350(h)(1). Continuous compliance is demonstrated by a 3-hour rolling average injection rate., 933720=37. See also 74 FR at 21158 n. 41 citing other statutory provisions indicating that the phrase \u201cfirst proposes\u201d can have a number of meanings., 927368=21. Summary of Environmental and Cost Impacts of Proposed Revisions to Portland Cement NESHAP (40 CFR Part 63, subpart LLL), April 15, 2009., 435991=We determined SNCR to be BDT and applied a control efficiency for the SNCR to the baseline uncontrolled level to determine the appropriate NO X level consistent with application of BDT. As discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, SNCR performance varies depending on various factors, but especially the normalized molar ratio (NMR), or the molar ratio of ammonia injected to NO X- higher removal efficiencies are associated with a higher NMR. SNCR performance has been shown to range from 20 to 80 percent NO X removal. At proposal we used an efficiency of 50 percent as representative of SNCR performance on average. Since then, additional information on SNCR performance has become available including data supplied by State commenters as well as a 2008 report by the Portland Cement Association. These data are summarized below. Reported removal efficiencies range from 25 to over 90 percent. According to a 2008 PCA report, ammonia slip occurs at molar ratios generally above 1.0. The graph below illustrates the relationship between the ammonia molar ratio, or NMR, and the performance of SNCR. EPA also examined the data to determine if uncontrolled NO X emissions affected SNCR performance since SNCR performance has been shown to improve with higher uncontrolled NO X levels, but the data here did not show any effect between initial NO X concentration and SNCR performance. Using the data below, the average removal efficiency of SNCR is 60 percent. Thus, EPA believes the 50 percent removal efficiency used to establish the NO X emission limit is a reasonable estimate of the SNCR performance that allows for an operating margin considering reasonable worst-case conditions that can be expected within the industry or source category as a whole. This operating margin should be sufficient to allow facilities where a greater than 50 percent reduction may be necessary to meet the 1.5 lb/ton clinker limit to increase ammonia injection to achieve greater than 50 percent reduction without causing ammonia slip., 890915=24.Section 63.1355 is amended by revising paragraphs (e) and paragraph (f) and adding paragraph (g) to read as follows:, 393733=Finally, the continuous collection of data used to assess compliance with this twice-adjusted standard does not create a limit more stringent that otherwise allowed. As discussed in the preamble to the Credible Evidence Rule, \u201c* * * continuous monitoring of the standards (has) no effect on the stringency of the standard * * *\u201d (62 FR at 8326, February 24, 1997)., 113889=We proposed amendments to the Portland Cement Manufacturing NESHAP on May 6, 2009. See 74 FR 21136. We received a total of 3,229 comments from the Portland cement industry, environmental groups, State environmental agencies and others during the comment period. This final rule reflects our consideration of all the comments we received. Detailed responses to the comments not included in this preamble are contained in the Summary of Public Comments and Responses document, which is included in the docket for this rulemaking., 945334=60.

March, 2007., 127644=Section 111 of the CAA requires that NSPS reflect the application of the best system of emission reductions which, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, any non-air quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements, the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated. This level of control is commonly referred to as best demonstrated technology (BDT).

Proposed RIA for the Transport Rule. Prepared by Office of Air and Radiation. June. Available on the Internet at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/ecas/ria.html., 252949=EPA is eliminating the restriction, adopted in the 2006 rule, on the use of fly ash where the mercury content of the fly ash has been increased through the use of activated carbon once the kiln has complied with a numerical mercury emissions limit. Given the emission limitation for mercury, whereby kilns must continuously meet the mercury emission limits described above (including when using these materials) there does not appear to be a need for such a provision. This provision is removed once a kiln is in compliance with the mercury limitations adopted in this. We are removing the requirement at compliance, rather than when the rule takes effect, to prevent the possibility of additional mercury emissions between the rule's effective date and the required compliance date. However, once the rule takes effect EPA is removing the requirement to maintain the amount of cement kiln dust wasted during testing of a control device, and the provision requiring that kilns remove from the kiln system sufficient amounts of dust so as not to impair product quality for the same reasons. In this case, we do not see immediate removal of these provisions as creating a likelihood of increased mercury emissions prior to the compliance date., 844103=(2) As of December 31, 2011 and within 60 days after the date of completing each performance evaluation or test, as defined in \u00a7 63.2, conducted to demonstrate compliance with this subpart, you must submit the relative accuracy test audit data and performance test data, except opacity data, to EPA by successfully submitting the data electronically to EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) by using the Electronic Reporting Tool(ERT) (see http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/ert_tool.html/)., 855127=(3) Corrective actions.

The standards for new kilns apply to facilities that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction after May 6, 2009., 241727=At proposal we noted that open clinker piles were currently unregulated, and that hexavalent chromium emissions had been detected in fugitive dust from these piles. See 74 FR at 21163. We requested comment and information as to how common the practice of open clinker storage is, appropriate ways to detect or measure fugitive emissions (ranging from open-path techniques to continuous digital or intermittent manual visible emissions techniques), any measurements of emissions of hexavalent chromium (or other HAP) from these open storage piles, potential controls to reduce emissions, or any other factors we should consider., 52514=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 888986=(b) Owners or operators conducting tests to determine the rates of emission of specific organic HAP from raw material dryers, kilns and in-line kiln/raw mills at Portland cement manufacturing facilities, solely for use in applicability determinations under \u00a7 63.1340 of this subpart are permitted to use Method 320 of appendix A to this part, or Method 18 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter., 204700=Setting technology-based MACT standards for HCl will result in significant reductions in emissions of other pollutants, most notably SO 2, and would likely also result in additional reductions in emissions of mercury, along with condensable PM, ammonia, and semi-volatile compounds. The additional reductions of SO 2 alone attributable to the MACT standard for HCl are estimated to be 124,000 tons per year in the third year following promulgation of the proposed HCl standard. These are substantial reductions with substantial public health benefits. SO 2 emissions are associated with a variety of human health, ecosystem, and visibility effects. 75 FR at 35525-27 (June 22, 2010). Even more significantly, SO 2 is also a precursor to PM 2.5. Reducing SO 2 emissions also reduces PM 2.5 formation, human exposure, and the incidence of PM 2.5-related health effects, among them premature mortality and cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity. See detailed discussion of PM 2.5 health effects in the text at Table 13 below., 926446=19.

The average of the run injection rates will determine the applicable injection rate limit., 888653=(a) If you are conducting tests to determine the rates of emission of HCl from kilns and associated bypass stacks at portland cement manufacturing facilities, for use in applicability determinations under \u00a7 63.1340, you may use Method 320 or Method 321 of appendix A of this part., 497852=EPA does not agree with the industry commenter that the limit of 1.33 lb/ton based on uncontrolled SO 2 emissions of 13 lb/ton of clinker and a 90 percent reduction leaves no margin for compliance. First, there are scrubbers with efficiencies higher than 90 percent removal efficiency, which, even if they can't meet the 1.33 (or the 0.4) lb/ton clinker emission limit, will be able to consistently meet 90 percent removal. Secondly, based on an industry commenter, the SO 2 emissions from a PH/PC kiln are not likely to be as high as 13 lb/ton of clinker due to the scrubbing effects of the raw mill, but more in the range of 4-5 lb/ton of clinker (75). This is supported by data from a 2001 survey of cement plants showing that average SO 2 emissions from PH kilns was 1.39 lb/ton of clinker (maximum of 6.54) and from PC kilns was 1.92 lb/ton of clinker (maximum of 8.83). Based on these data, use of a wet scrubber should be able to meet the proposed SO 2 limit of 1.33 and the final limit of 0.4 lb/ton clinker. In some cases, a less expensive control such as lime injection may be adequate. Regarding the industry commenters reference to determinations reported in the RBLC that reflect uncontrolled SO 2 emission rates over 20.0 lb/ton, these rates (if they are accurate) are associated with old wet kilns that do not have inline raw mills. In the case of one the two Michigan kilns, the quarries raw materials are known to have extremely high sulfur contents that are not seen at other locations. However, even if this location decided to build a new kiln, or to modify or reconstruct an existing kiln, they would still have the option to meet the 90 percent removal option., 832671=K = conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (7000 gr/lb)., 228705=Other commenters suggested that even if EPA has such discretion, it would (or should) be limited to a reanalysis of the original database for the 1999 rule and so should not consider kilns' subsequent performance. Were EPA to take that approach here, the floor (and standard) for PM would be more stringent than the floor (and standard) in this rule. [33] Because EPA considers the database for the current rule to be more representative of performance capabilities of best performing kilns than the sparser 1999 database, EPA is basing its determination on the more representative data., 190742=iv. Standards for THC. We are establishing the emissions limit for THC at the floor level of control. In addition, because the final existing source standard will be more stringent than the new source standard of 50 ppmvd for greenfield new sources contained in the 1999 final rule, we are also removing the 50 ppmvd standard for both kilns and raw material dryers., 107899=Section 112(k)(3)(B) of the CAA requires EPA to identify at least 30 HAP that pose the greatest potential health threat in urban areas, and section 112(c)(3) requires EPA to regulate, under section 112(d) standards, the area source [1] categories that represent 90 percent of the emissions of the 30 \u201clisted\u201d HAP (\u201curban HAP\u201d). We implemented these listing requirements through the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy (64 FR 38715, July 19, 1999). [2], 189893=iii. Beyond the floor determination. At proposal we evaluated several practices and technologies that are available to cement kilns to control emissions of organic HAP at a level beyond the floor. 74 FR at 21152. These practices include raw materials substitution, ACI systems and limestone scrubber and regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO). We rejected each of these alternatives based on technical limitations or poor cost- effectiveness. Consideration of non-air quality impacts and energy support this determination as well (RTOs in particular being associated with appreciable energy penalties). 74 FR at 21152. We received no comments that have caused us to change that proposed decision. Therefore, we are choosing the floor level of control for the final THC emissions limit., 933179=35. Telecon with Tuyet-Le Pham, South Coast Air Quality Management District. June 29, 2010., 156341=Although industry commenters originally raised the issue of long term intra-quarry variability during the initial May 2007 30-day data collection, no plant chose to perform additional sampling and analysis of their raw materials and feed that would have allowed this issue to be directly addressed. Certain industry commenters did point, however, to data from the 30-day sampling effort as providing useful information on potential intra-quarry mercury variability of the two best performers. The data come from 30-day sampling conducted at four sources (three of which are located at a single facility), which all quarry limestone from a common geologic limestone formation. [13] All six kilns (the two floor kilns, and the other four kilns in the immediate vicinity) are in the same city and within 9 miles of each other. It is a reasonable assumption that variability of mercury levels (as opposed to mercury levels themselves) across this formation are substantially the same and therefore that the variability of mercury levels in the two best performers' quarries can be adjusted to reflect the variability seen in the other quarries which are part of the common geologic formation. See Brick MACT, 479 F. 3d at 881-882 (EPA may look at performance of sources which are not among the best in estimating variability of best performers if there is a demonstrated relationship between the two)., 520154=In addition to this traditional estimation of emission reductions, EPA employed the ISIS model to estimate emission reductions from the NESHAP and NSPS. The estimation of emission reductions in the ISIS model accounts for the optimization of the industry and includes the addition of new kilns, kiln retirements, replacements, and expansions as well as installation of controls. Using the ISIS model, in 2013 we estimate reductions of 12,627 lbs of mercury, 10,809 tons of THC, 4,307 tons of HCl, 5,729 tons of PM (does not include reductions in secondary PM), and 80,245 tons of SO 2, and 14,159 tons of NO X compared to emissions that would occur in 2013 in the absence of the NESHAP and NSPS. As noted, the ISIS model estimates lower SO 2 reductions because the model optimizes kiln retirements, replacements, and expansions as well as installation of controls. We did not determine ambient PM benefits based on the ISIS model's predicted emission reductions. However, even with this lower SO 2 reduction estimate, the secondary PM impacts would likely constitute a majority of the total ambient PM impacts. More information on the ISIS Model and results can be found in the ISIS TSD and in a Technical Memo to the docket., 347270=Comment: Industry commenter 2844 stated that EPA could interpret section 112(d)(3) as Brick MACT appears to do, as one unitary concept meaning sources with the lowest emission levels, or EPA can interpret it as a more complex concept that EPA may determine the emission control (using any of the various definitions in the CAA) that sources have achieved in practice (as estimated by reasonably predictive variability factors) and rank them according to their relative emissions levels (i.e., a quantitative measure of achievement). Having done so, the Agency can then evaluate each of the lowest emitters in terms of whether they meet the Agency's criteria for best controlled similar source. With regard to best controlled, EPA may evaluate this from a purely quantitative angle (lowest emissions) or from more qualitative aspects, reduction efficiency, environmental and health (or cross-media) impacts, cost-effectiveness of reductions achieved, impacts on other HAP or pollutant emissions, and so on., 237162=EPA did not propose beyond-the-floor standards for PM. This was because the cost effectiveness of adopting beyond-the-floor controls was several orders of magnitude greater than EPA has accepted for PM reductions in other rules where standards allow consideration of costs, and because the incremental amount of PM removed was very small (3 tpy nationwide). Consideration of non-air quality issues did not change this conclusion. 74 FR at 21155. Commenters did not challenge this analysis. EPA accordingly is not adopting beyond-the-floor standards for PM., 543839=Historically, EPA has most often estimated employment changes associated with plant closures due to environmental regulation or changes in output for the regulated industry (EPA, 1999a; EPA, 2000). This partial equilibrium approach focuses only on the \u201cdemand\u201d portion of the projected change in employment and neglects other employment changes. EPA provides this estimate because it employs the most detailed modeling for the industry being regulated even if it does not capture all types of employment impacts. In addition to the employment effects identified by Morgenstern et al., we also expect that the substitutes for cement (e.g., asphalt) would expand production as consumers shift away from cement to other products. This would also lead to increased employment in those industries. Focusing only on the \u201cdemand effect\u201d, it can be seen that the estimate from the historical approach is within the range presented by the Morgenstern \u201cdemand effect\u201d portion. This strengthens our comfort in the reasonableness of both estimates. In April of this year, EPA started including an estimate based on the Morgenstern approach because it is thought to be a broader measure of the employment impacts of this type of environmental regulation. Thus, this analysis goes beyond what EPA has typically done because the parameters estimated in the Morgenstern paper were used to estimate all three effects (\u201cdemand,\u201d \u201ccost,\u201d and \u201cfactor shift\u201d). This transfer of results from the Morgenstern study is uncertain but avoids ignoring the \u201ccost effect\u201d and the \u201cfactor-shift effect.\u201d, 555365=As a result of this action, ISIS projects cement industry revenues are projected to decline by 4.5 percent, or $421 million. We estimate cement demand to drop 5.7 percent in 2013 or 7.0 million tons as a result of this action. The drop in demand will affect the domestic production and imports. Domestic production may fall by 9.6 percent or 9.0 million tons in 2013 compared to the baseline. Imports are likely to rise by 2.0 million tons. ISIS estimates that the average national price for Portland cement in 2013 could be 6.8 percent higher, or $5.79 per metric ton. More information on this model can be found in the ISIS TSD and in a Technical Memo to the docket., 223483=At this time, we now believe the ecological risk analysis performed in 2006 is insufficient, as it was merely a literature review and not a formal ecological assessment, and, as discussed in the previous paragraphs, it did not cover the impacts of the other acid gases, nor did it cover about one third of the existing cement plants. No additional information was provided during the comment period which addressed these various technical issues, notwithstanding EPA's solicitation of data., 340415=Comment: Industry commenters 2831, 2844, 2845, and 2874 stated that in evaluating the economic cost of achieving emission reductions, looking at one plant's emission control of only one pollutant to the exclusion of all other emission controls produces a disjointed view of cost implications and compliance feasibility. While an individual MACT floor for one pollutant might not appear cost-prohibitive, when combined with all of the other MACT floors for other pollutants, the total cost implications could become especially onerous. While the CAA was authored with the intent of reducing air pollution, Congress did not intend to disrupt the productive capacity of the United States through the promulgation of economically unachievable standards. 42 U.S.C. 7401(b)(1)(2006). By setting MACT floors individually and ignoring the collective cost implications of the entire NESHAP, EPA would effectively disregard the CAA's requirement that air pollution control be advanced while promoting the nation's productive capacity. Id., 382470=Industry commenter 2901 stated that CEMS should not be used as a compliance method for cement plants for the following reasons:, 803994=(c) For an affected source subject to a D/F emission limitation under \u00a7 63.1343 that employs sorbent injection as an emission control technique you must operate the sorbent injection system in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section., 235551=EPA does not agree with the comment that use of a CEM renders the standard more stringent and so results in floors (and standards) more stringent than those achieved by average of the best performing sources. First, the continuous collection of data used to assess compliance with this standard does not create a limit more stringent that otherwise allowed. As discussed in the preamble to the Credible Evidence Rule, \u201c* * * continuous monitoring of the standards (has) no effect on the stringency of the standard * * * \u201d (62 FR at 8326, February 24, 1997)., 362830=Industry commenter 2844 stated that in the Portland cement proposal, EPA set MACT floor levels that reflect the specific conditions at the time the data were generated and do not include any of the operational variability. The commenter suggests that EPA must look beyond its snap shots of performance to make a reasoned evaluation and estimation of all operating conditions and factors that might impact the level of actual emissions from those kilns in practice, and adjust their reported short term test data appropriately. EPA can and should adjust raw emissions results to estimate sources' achieved emissions levels when setting MACT floors and standards. Since Brick MACT, EPA's methodology now must be able to reasonably estimate the impacts of variability associated with both technological and nontechnological factors over the full range of circumstances., 626726=(i) 0.30 pound per ton of feed (dry basis) to the kiln if construction, reconstruction, or modification of the kiln commences after August 17, 1971 but on or before June 16, 2008., 104129=Section 307(d)(7)(B) of the CAA further provides that \u201c[o]nly an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment (including any public hearing) may be raised during judicial review.\u201d This section also provides a mechanism for EPA to convene a proceeding for reconsideration, \u201c[i]f the person raising an objection can demonstrate to EPA that it was impracticable to raise such objection within [the period for public comment] or if the grounds for such objection arose after the period for public comment (but within the time specified for judicial review) and if such objection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule.\u201d Any person seeking to make such a demonstration to us should submit a Petition for Reconsideration to the Office of the Administrator, U.S. EPA, Room 3000, Ariel Rios Building, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, with a copy to both the person(s) listed in the preceding FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section, and the Associate General Counsel for the Air and Radiation Law Office, Office of General Counsel (Mail Code 2344A), U.S. EPA, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460., 317679=For more information on our sector's analyses, its benefits and interaction with NSR, NAAQS and Regional Haze please refer to the preamble of the proposal of this rule (74 FR 21159-61)., 589826=The annual burden for this information collection averaged over the first 3 years of this ICR is estimated to total 2,559 labor-hours per year at a cost of $240,064 per year.

Ass'n is misplaced as the CAA's procedure regarding the selection of MACT technologies differs on a textual basis from the CWA's procedure for identifying best available technology. Under the CWA, BAT standards are to be set based on the best practicable control technology currently available. 33 U.S.C. 1311(b)(1)(A)(i)(2006). This has led to pollutant-by-pollutant determinations.

Available on the Internet at http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=216546., 360432=Response: The industry commenter refers to legislative history to versions of the 1990 amendments which did not include floor requirements, so it is not directly applicable in interpreting the enacted provisions. Moreover, as held repeatedly by the DC Circuit, the \u201cachievability\u201d requirement in section 112 (d)(2) does not alter the minimum level of stringency requirements mandated by section 112 (d)(3)'s requirements. See, e.g., Cement Kiln Recycling Coalition, 255 F. 3d at 861-62., 103647=Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), judicial review of these final rules are available only by filing a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by November 8, 2010. Under section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, the requirements established by these final rules may not be challenged separately in any civil or criminal proceedings brought by EPA to enforce these requirements., 320882=According to the industry commenters, the focus on overall performance is not surprising because in the 1990 CAA Amendments Congress abandoned section 112's previous focus on individual pollutant standards, and adopted the technology-based multi-pollutant approach to regulating toxics in use under the Clean Water Act (CWA). See S. Rep. No. 228, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 133-34 (1989). Thus, if one source can achieve a firm degree of control for one pollutant but not for another, there may be no justification for including it in the set of sources from which the floor is calculated (Tanners' Council of America v. Train, 540 F.2d 1188, 1193 (4th Cir. 1976) deeming CWA effluent limitations guidelines not achievable where plants in EPA's database were capable of meeting the limitations for some, but not all, of the pollutant parameters)., 217391=In the 2006 final rule, EPA did not set any standard for HCl. [29] The Agency reasoned that no further control was necessary for Portland cement emissions of HCl because HCl is a \u201chealth threshold pollutant\u201d and human health is protected with an ample margin of safety at current HCl emission levels. 71 FR at 76527. Underlying this conclusion was EPA's analysis of a tiered screening study of dispersion modeling of cement facilities' worst-case and actual HCl emissions. This study was conducted by the Portland Cement Association for about two-thirds of operating U.S. cement plants. Dispersion modeling results were evaluated against the RfC for HCl. [30] The screening analysis involved making conservative assumptions regarding HCl emission concentrations and plants' operating conditions (greater concentrations than known to be emitted and perpetual operation at maximum capacity). All plants in the analysis, with five exceptions, had HCl levels well below a Hazard Quotient (HQ) level of 1.0, the ratio of exposure (or modeled concentration) to the health reference value or threshold level. The remaining five plants in the analysis had HQ levels greater than 1.0 assuming maximum emissions, but less than 1.0 when their actual emissions were used in the dispersion models. Id. at 76528-29., 181597=In this analysis, the PCA proposed two subcategories: Kilns where the coal preparation mill exhaust is comingled with the kiln exhaust, and kilns where the coal preparation mill has a separate stack. The PCA maintains that subcategories are needed because emissions for the coal preparation mill (which are believed to be chiefly methane from the coal) will, all other things being equal, elevate the THC emissions of the kiln exhaust. See also 74 FR at 21152. The PCA recommended floors are shown in Tables 5 and 6 below:, 806426=(f) No kiln may use as a raw material or fuel any fly ash where the mercury content of the fly ash has been increased through the use of activated carbon, or any other sorbent, unless the facility can demonstrate that the use of that fly ash will not result in an increase in mercury emissions over baseline emissions (i.e., emissions not using the fly ash). The facility has the burden of proving there has been no emissions increase over baseline. Once the kiln must comply with a mercury limit specified in \u00a7 63.1343, this paragraph no longer applies., 318178=This section presents a summary of responses to major comments.

As we noted at proposal, Section 112 (a)(4) of the Act states that a new source is a stationary source if \u201cthe construction or reconstruction of which is commenced after the Administrator first proposes regulations under this section establishing an emissions standard applicable to such source.\u201d \u201cFirst proposes\u201d could refer to the date EPA first proposes standards for the source category as a whole, or could refer to the date the agency first proposes standards under a particular rulemaking record or first proposes the particular standards at issue. The definition is also ambiguous with regard to whether it refers to a standard for the source as a whole, or to a HAP-specific standard (so that there could be different new source standards for different HAP which are regulated at different times).

The requirements at \u00a7 63.1349 for PM CEMS are incomplete and ambiguous and EPA has failed to specify important QA frequencies and other information relevant to the implementation of PM CEMS in accordance with PS-11 and Procedure 2. The proposed Subpart LLL revisions fail to address critical elements including the following sections of PS-11 and Procedure 2:, 227100=Particulate matter serves as a surrogate for non-volatile metal HAP (a determination upheld for this source category in National Lime Ass'n, 233 F. 3d at 637-39). Existing and new major sources are presently subject to a PM limit of 0.3 lb/ton of feed which is equivalent to 0.5 lb/ton clinker. EPA is amending this standard for major sources, and also adding PM standards for existing and new area source cement kilns. In all instances, EPA is revising these limits because they do not represent MACT, but rather a level which is achievable by the bulk of the industry. See 63 FR at 14198 (March 24, 1998); see also 233 F. 3d at 633 (indicating that the standards for PM were likely legally deficient but that the argument had not been properly preserved for the court to adjudicate). This is not legally permissible. Brick MACT, 479 F. 3d at 880-81. EPA thus does not accept the argument of some commenters that EPA may only amend promulgated MACT standards by means of the periodic review procedures of section 112(d)(6), which does not include re-determining floor levels. Section 112(d)(6)does not indicate that it is the exclusive means of amending MACT standards, and in particular does not speak to a situation where an original floor was palpably short of statutory requirements and where that floor became the ultimate standard. EPA consequently believes it has discretion to reconsider and redo the MACT floor analysis for PM, and to amend the standard as appropriate., 53821=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 1, 2015, 629432=(ii) 0.01 pound per ton of clinker on a 30-operating day rolling average if construction, reconstruction, or modification of the clinker cooler commences after June 16, 2008. An operating day includes all valid data obtained in any daily 24-hour period during which the kiln operates, and excludes any measurements made during the daily 24-hour period when the kiln was not operating., 366673=Comment: Industry commenter 2844 also stated that EPA adopted a floor setting methodology that is based on using lowest reported emission results with minimal variability adjustments to estimate emission control achieved in practice by best performing sources. EPA considered test-to-test variability, but did not consider the inherent variability due to raw materials, product mix, fuels, operating conditions and plant types. The industry commenter stated that EPA has not evaluated or validated whether its methodology accurately estimates emissions control achieved in real world circumstances at sources., 606116=This final action does not have Tribal implications, as specified in Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). It will not have substantial direct effects on Tribal governments, on the relationship between the Federal government and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal government and Indian Tribes, as specified in Executive Order 13175. The final rule imposes requirements on owners and operators of specified industrial facilities and not Tribal governments. The only Tribally owned source is not affected by the amendments to subpart F. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this action., 112295=In response to the Court's remand and vacatur of the CISWI Definitions rule, EPA initiated a rulemaking to identify which secondary materials are non-hazardous \u201csolid waste\u201d for purposes of subtitle D (non-hazardous waste) of the RCRA when burned in a combustion unit. See 75 FR 31844 (June 4, 2010). Any final definition adopted in that rulemaking, in turn, will determine the applicability of CAA section 129(a) (i.e., any combustion unit that burns any non-hazardous secondary material that is considered to be a solid waste would be subject to CAA section 129 requirements)., 811194=(ii) If you are subject to a D/F emission limitation under \u00a7 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate initial compliance with the temperature operating limits specified in \u00a7 63.1344 by using the performance test methods and procedures in \u00a7 63.1349(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(iv). The average of the run temperatures will determine the applicable temperature limit., 887269=(a) Except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section, the compliance date for an owner or operator of an existing affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart is June 14, 2002., 889451=23.Section 63.1354 is amended by adding paragraphs (b)(9)(vi) and (c) to read as follows:, 795773=14.Section 63.1344 is revised to read as follows:, 348450=Industry commenter 2845 provided several examples of judicial MACT decisions endorsing a technology approach to setting the standards, in which EPA selected the best performing sources based on the relative performance of air pollution control technology., 177358=At proposal we set the emissions limit based on the 99th percentile of the available data. As a result of new data received after the comment period, we recalculated the averages of the kilns for which we had CEMS data and selected the best performing two kilns (12 percent of 15 total kilns) based on their average emissions. See Calculations of Floors for Final Portland Cement NESHAP dated August 6, 2010. Because these were large data sets (688 and 274 readings), we directly calculated the 99th percentile of the 30-day averages to determine the MACT floor which is 24 ppmvd. [22] This is shown in Table 3., 121537=EPA received comments on the notice of reconsideration from two cement companies, three energy companies, three industry associations, a technical consultant, one State, one environmental group, one ash management company, one fuels company, and one private citizen. As part of these comments, one industry trade association submitted a petition to withdraw the new source MACT standards for mercury and THC and one environmental group submitted a petition for reconsideration of the 2006 final action. A summary of these comments is available in the docket for this rulemaking. [7], 887741=(c) Except as noted in paragraph (d) of this section, the compliance date for an owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart that commences new construction or reconstruction after March 24, 1998, is June 14, 1999, or upon startup of operations, whichever is later., 404536=Comment: Several industry commenters (2832 and 2859) opposed the proposed requirement to install CEMS in order to satisfy compliance assurance monitoring (CAM) for selected pollutants. Instead, the commenter proposed that CAM requirements be satisfied using periodic stack testing to the extent that stack testing is requested or required by State air permits. According to EPA's proposal, the MACT floor for new and existing sources in this industry will be determined by stack testing results of sources within the MACT pool. If EPA were to finalize a numeric emissions limitation based on this approach to setting the new and existing MACT floors, that limitation will be based on the same stack testing data. CEMs will have played no role in this process. It stands to reason that compliance assurance should be based on stack testing results, and not a CEMS data that has played no part in this process., 53153=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 4, 2015, 845208=20. Section 63.1350 is revised to read as follows:, 609288=This rule is not a \u201csignificant energy action\u201d as defined in Executive Order 13211, (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) because it is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. Further, we have concluded that this rule is not likely to have any adverse energy effects. This rule will result in the addition of control equipment and monitoring systems for existing and new sources., 148054=Commenters presented virtually no quantified data that floor plants are unable to meet the standards. See National Association of Metal Finishers v. EPA, 719 F. 2d 624, 649 (3d Cir. 1983) (unquantified assertions are entitled to little if any weight). Rather, their comments (comment 2845 at Table 1, echoed by many other industry commenters) provided narrative descriptions purporting to demonstrate that floor plants would not be able to achieve the standards. [10] In those instances where commenters provided actual data on these plants' performance, EPA took the information into account in developing the final standards. Indeed, EPA adjusted all of the standards based on actual data presented. However, EPA is not willing to act on pure supposition and conjecture regarding variability, particularly in the face of record information indicating that not only all floor plants but a number of additional plants are already meeting the promulgated standards., 945668=61. The results of the demographic analysis are presented in \u201cReview of Environmental Justice Impacts\u201d, June 2010, a copy of which is available in the docket., 609842=The final rule under subpart F will result in the addition of alkaline scrubbers to certain kilns to reduce SO 2 emissions. We estimate the additional electrical demand to be 6.9 million kWhr per year by the end of the 2013., 164805=If we were to set a separate subcategory for these two kilns, we determined that the floor level of control would be approximately 2100 lb/MM tons clinker. Due to the high level of this floor, we evaluated a beyond-the-floor option of 85 percent reduction in emission for the highest emitting kiln. This level would represent the highest level of mercury control believed achievable for the highest emitting facility based on test data on a pilot mercury control system for that facility. [16] This level of control would result in an emissions limit of approximately 500 lb/MM tons clinker. This level is over 10 times the level that will be required for all other kilns, and even exceeds every other kiln's uncontrolled mercury emissions levels which range from 20 to 400 lb/MM tons clinker., 539063=In the ISIS results, we are not able to separate costs by pollutant because the model provides an overall optimization of the production and air pollution control costs. The total annual costs of the ISIS model for the NESHAP and NSPS are $350 million in 2013. This estimate is significantly lower than the total costs estimated by traditional methods., 603991=Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), requires EPA to develop an accountable process to ensure \u201cmeaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.\u201d \u201cPolicies that have federalism implications\u201d is defined in the Executive Order to include regulations that have \u201csubstantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\u201d, 203626=iv. Determination not to Establish a Risk-Based Standard for HCl. At proposal, EPA elected not to exercise its discretion under CAA section 112(d)(4) and proposed a major source standard for HCl based on MACT. The primary basis for not setting a health-based standard was that setting a MACT standard for HCl not only controlled HCl but also co-controlled other HAP (such as HF, Chlorine (Cl 2), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN)) and criteria pollutants yielding very substantial environmental benefits. However, we also requested comment on whether we had the legal authority to establish a standard for HCl, and, if so, whether we should exercise our discretion to do so. 74 FR at 21154. After considering comments, EPA has decided not to exercise its discretion to establish a risk-based standard for HCl under CAA section 112(d)(4), opting instead to promulgate a standard for HCl based on the performance of MACT in this final rule. This section discusses the basis for that decision., 822193=(6) THC compliance. If you are subject to limitations on THC emissions under \u00a7 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate continuous compliance with the THC emissions standards by using the monitoring methods and procedures in \u00a7 63.1350 (i) and (j). Continuous compliance is demonstrated by a 30-day rolling average THC concentration, except for periods of startup and shutdown, where the standard is based on a 7-day rolling average., 161088=EPA may create subcategories which distinguish among \u201cclasses, types, and sizes of sources.\u201d CAA section 112(d)(1). EPA reads this provision to provide the Agency with discretion to subcategorize, and EPA may exercise that discretion if sources are rationally distinguishable due to some difference in class, type or size. See Lignite Energy Council v. EPA, 198 F. 3d 930, 933 (DC Cir. 1999) (\u201cEPA is not required by law to subcategorize\u2014section 111[b][2] merely states that `the Administrator may distinguish among classes, types, and sizes within categories of new sources' \u201d (emphasis original)). Moreover, as we noted at proposal, \u201cnormally, any basis for subcategorizing must be related to an effect on emissions, rather than to some difference among sources which does not affect emissions performance.\u201d 74 FR at 21145. EPA may also exercise this discretion on a pollutant-specific basis, since the difference in class, type or size may only have practical significance for certain HAP. In this final rule, EPA carefully considered the possibility of creating different subcategories of cement kilns with respect to mercury emissions., 925814=18. Mercury Emission in the U.S. by Source Category 1990 to 1993, 2002, and 2005. http://cfpub.epa.gov/eroe/index.cfm?fuseaction=detail.viewMidImg&amp;ch=46&amp;lShowInd=0&amp;subtop=341&amp;lv=list.listByChapter&amp;r=188199., 307453=First, Portland cement is one of the largest stationary source categories of GHG emissions, ranking as the third highest U.S. source of CO 2 emissions. Second, based on our initial evaluation it appears that there are cost-effective control strategies for this source category that would provide an appropriate basis for establishing a standard of performance for GHG emissions. See 73 FR 44491, July 30, 2008. These control strategies include, for example, energy efficiency measures, reductions in cement clinker content, and raw materials substitution. There may be other cost-effective controls as well., 215287=3. There is a significant body of scientific literature addressing the health effects of acute exposure to HCl (California Office of Health Hazard Assessment, 2008. Acute Toxicity Summary for Hydrogen Chloride, http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/hot_spots/2008/AppendixD2_final.pdf#page=112 EPA, 2001). However, we currently lack information on the peak short-term emissions of HCl from cement kilns which might allow us to determine whether a chronic health-based emission standard for HCl would ensure that acute exposures will not pose health concerns., 353827=Industry commenter 2841 stated that the use of a minimum of five facilities should be adopted in the establishment of THC standards as well as the other standards in this proposed regulation. The establishment of requirements based on a small amount of data would run counter to the intent of the CAA in utilizing data that is truly representative of the best-performing facilities throughout an entire industry., 388076=Comment: Industry commenter 2845 stated that EPA should require that compliance with HCl limits should be measured by periodic stack tests. Because the HCl floors were developed from HCl stack test data, the standard for HCl should be based on periodic stack testing. EPA must evaluate valid data from Method 321/ASTM D6348 stack tests instead of the data contained in Table 5 of the proposal. Using CEMS to measure compliance effectively makes the standard more stringent than what has been achieved by the best-performing sources. If CEMS compliance demonstration is retained, then the limit for CEMS compliance must be raised to reflect the added variability that will be measured by the CEMS. While continuous measurement will capture variability of emissions 24 hours per day, 7 days per week over the full range of process and control system operating conditions over the life of the plant and its associated quarry, the stack test is merely a snapshot in time. By definition, a stack test contains no parameter related to variability other than that obtained during the three hours of testing. In addition to the inherent variability of HCl emissions, a CEMS standard must also consider the inaccuracy of the CEMS as determined (and allowed) relative to the required stack test methods, the uncertainty of calibration standards/materials, and other factors affecting the sampling, transport, and analysis of HCl which is a highly reactive compound., 923479=12. Development of The MACT Floors For The Final NESHAP For Portland Cement, August 6, 2010., 820603=(4) D/F compliance. If you are subject to a D/F emission limitation under \u00a7 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate continuous compliance with the temperature operating limits specified in \u00a7 63.1346 by using the installing, operating, and maintaining a continuous monitor to record the temperature of specified gas streams such that it meets the requirements of \u00a7 63.1350(g). Continuous compliance is demonstrated by a 3-hour rolling average temperature., 125361=After considering the implications of this decision, EPA granted the petition for reconsideration of all the existing source standards in the 2006 rulemaking., 375809=Comment: Several industry commenters (2832 and 2859) opposed the approach taken by EPA in its beyond-the-floor MACT analysis. Among other things, EPA failed to consider the creation of incremental greenhouse gas emissions associated with the construction, installation and operation of new emissions control equipment, and the minimal incremental environmental benefit associated with those controls. Also, EPA failed to consider the cost of carbon credit purchases by the industry., 137119=This formula uses a pooled variance (in the s [2] term) that encompasses all the data-point to data-point variability of the best performing sources comprising the MACT floor pool for each HAP. Where variability was calculated using the UPL statistical approach (i.e., for the Hg, HCl, and PM standards), we used the average (or sample mean) and sample standard deviation, which are two statistical measures calculated from the data distributions for mercury, HCl, and PM. The average is a central value of a data set, and the standard deviation is the common measure of the dispersion of the data set around the average. We describe in detail in the preamble sections on mercury, HCl and PM and in the memorandum \u201cDevelopment of the MACT Floors for the Final NESHAP for Portland Cement\u201d, August 6, 2010\u201d how these averages were developed. We note here that the methodology accounts for both short-term and long-term variability and encompasses run-to-run and test-to-test variability. The formula also applies differently depending on how the underlying data set is distributed. To this end, EPA carefully evaluated the data sets for each HAP to ascertain whether the data were normally distributed, or distributed in some other manner (i.e., log normally). After applying standard and rigorous statistical tests (involving the degree of \u201cskewness\u201d of the data), we determined that the distributions for mercury and particulate matter were approximately a normal distribution, which in turn determined the final form of the UPL equation. See Floor Calculations for Final Portland Cement NESHAP, August 6, 2010; see also 75 FR at 32019-20., 167178=Thus, creating a high-mercury subcategory for two kilns based on limestone mercury content would result in standards allowing emissions of 500 lb/MM tons of clinker. Based on 2008 production rates, this would allow 1,020 pounds of mercury emissions per year from the potential two-plant subcategory. To put this in perspective, the rest of the industry (92 plants) would be allowed to emit 1,012 pounds tons of mercury per year (again based on 2008 production rates), and the two high-emitting plants would be allowed to emit 1,020 pounds per year. This would result in a doubling of mercury emissions from this source category after the application of MACT. Moreover, national mercury emissions for industrial sources are approximately 50 tpy. [18] That would mean that these two sources alone would constitute 1 percent of the industrial mercury emissions for the U.S. EPA believes it is a reasonable exercise of discretion not to create a subcategory, where, as here, doing so would allow on-going emissions of a disproportionately high volume of a high-toxicity pollutant., 523905=The addition of scrubbers will increase water usage by about 4,200 million gallons per year. For a new 1.2 million tpy kiln, water usage will be 72 million gallons per year or 630 million gallons by 2013 for all kilns subject to new source limits for HCl and NSPS limits., 827131=19.Section 63.1349 is revised to read as follows:, 318672=Comment: Many industry commenters (2830, 2832, 2836, 2841, 2844, 2845, 2858, 2859, 2863, 2864, 2874, 2890, 2908, 2910, 2914, 2915, 2916, and 2917) stated that setting MACT floors on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis violates the law and results in MACT floors that bear no relation to emission limits that are being achieved at the best performing existing sources. According to industry commenters, this method violates the plain language and intent of section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and its effect is a MACT floor that reflects a standard that no one plant in existence currently achieves. Industry commenters 2832, 2841, 2844, 2845, 2846, 2910, 2914, 2915, and 2916 stated that section 112(d)'s use of the terms best-performing and existing clearly means that sources in a category or subcategory that are used to set the MACT floor are to be real, not theoretical or hypothetical, sources (42 U.S.C. 7412(d), 2006 and Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority, 358 F.3d at 954). They further contend that the phrase achieved in practice can only mean that Congress intended actual sources, performing under real-life conditions, to be the benchmark for determining the MACT floors. Furthermore, the language of the statute does not speak in terms of the best-performing source or sources for each listed pollutant or group of pollutants (42 U.S.C. 7412(d)). Rather, the focus is on the best existing source or sources for all pollutants, and what these sources truly can achieve on an overall basis. Industry commenters argue that EPA's pollutant-by-pollutant methodology is also at odds with the legislative history underlying section 112(d) (S. Rep. No. 228, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 169, 1989)., 888319=22.Section 63.1352 is revised to read as follows:, 173516=We are basing the final mercury standard on the floor level of control. When we establish a beyond the floor standard we typically identify control techniques that have the ability to achieve an emissions limit more stringent than the MACT floor. Under these final amendments, most existing kilns would have to have installed both a wet scrubber and activated carbon injection (ACI) for control of mercury, HCl and THC. [21] To achieve further reductions in mercury beyond what can be achieved using wet scrubber and ACI in combination, the available options would include closing the kiln and relocating to a limestone quarry having lower mercury concentrations in the limestone, transporting low-mercury limestone in from long distances, switching other raw materials to lower the amount of limestone in the feed, wasting CKD, and installing additional add-on control devices. These options were discussed at proposal, and were rejected as either technically infeasible or not cost-effective. Consideration of non-air quality impacts and energy requirements do not change this conclusion. See 74 FR at 22249-50. We received no comments that would cause us to change that determination., 377629=Industry commenter 2855 stated that mercury sorbent trap monitoring systems have not been evaluated through long term field trials at cement plants in the United States (U.S.) in accordance with the proposed performance specifications and quality assurance procedures, so the reliability and performance of these measurement systems and the adequacy of the technical specifications cannot be determined., 279674=After consideration of comments on the selection of the date for mercury, THC, and HCl, we believe that the May 6, 2009, date for all pollutants is more in keeping with the evident intent of Section 112(a)(4) that source should have sufficient notice that new source controls requirements can be considered in the initial design. We accept commenters' argument that sources coming into existence between the proposed date of the 2006 standards and the May 6, 2009, proposal date of these amendments would have no reasonable means of ascertaining the standards' final content and so lacked notice of what controls and strategies to adopt. Since this is antithetical to the policy underlying new source standards, EPA is adopting May 6, 2009, as the date which determines if a source is existing or new., 628262=(4) Exceed 0.4 pounds of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) per ton of clinker on a 30-operating day rolling average if construction, reconstruction, or modification commences after June 16, 2008, unless you are demonstrating a 90 percent SO 2 emissions reduction measured across the SO 2 control device. An operating day includes all valid data obtained in any daily 24-hour period during which the kiln operates, and excludes any measurements made during the daily 24-hour period when the kiln was not operating., 126980=NSPS implement CAA section 111(b) and are issued for categories of sources which cause, or contribute significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. The primary purpose of the NSPS is to attain and maintain ambient air quality by ensuring that the best demonstrated emission control technologies are installed as the industrial infrastructure is modernized. Since 1970, the NSPS have been successful in achieving long-term emissions reductions in numerous industries by assuring cost-effective controls are installed on new, reconstructed, or modified sources., 218900=At proposal of these amendments, recognizing that the 2006 determination was deficient, if for no other reason because it failed to establish any emission standard whatever, EPA conducted its own analysis to determine what numerical standard for HCl would be necessary to at least assure that, for the sources in the controlled category or subcategory, persons exposed to emissions of HCl would not experience the adverse health effects on which the threshold is based. In order to determine this level, in the proposed rule we conducted a risk analysis of the same 68 facilities analyzed by PCA using a screening level dispersion model (AERSCREEN). Using the site specific stack parameters provided by the PCA and conservative meteorological conditions (taken from the PCA analysis), the AERSCREEN modeling predicted the highest long term ground level concentration surrounding each facility, and used this concentration to back calculate the highest allowable HCl emissions rate that could occur without exceeding the allowable RfC. The results of this analysis indicated that an HCl emission limit of 23 ppmv or less (an order of magnitude higher than the MACT standard) would result in no exceedances of the RfC for HCl for any of the facilities assessed. [31], 930466=29. Although the decision not to set a standard in 2006 was based on the authority of section 112(d)(4), we note that the statute in fact states: \u201cthe Administrator may consider such threshold level, with an ample margin of safety, when establishing emission standards under this subsection.\u201d Section 112(d)(4), emphasis added., 892221=25.Section 63.1356 is revised to read as follows:, 343268=Comment: Many industry commenters (2841, 2844, 2845, 2846, 2858, and 2914) stated that EPA established its proposed floors equating best performing sources with those that have the lowest emissions for particular HAPs even though there are other ways to measure performance and, in some cases, other methodologies may comply with the statute where the \u201clowest emitter\u201d approach does not. Industry commenter 2845 noted that equating best performer with lowest emitter contravenes a Congressional directive that, in developing MACT standards, EPA cannot require substitution of raw materials in mineral processing industries, such as cement manufacturing, quoting the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference for the 1990 CAA Amendments stated: For categories and subcategories of sources of [HAPs] engaged in mining, extraction, beneficiation, and processing of nonferrous ores, concentrates, minerals, metals, and related in-process materials, the Administrator shall not consider the substitution of, or other changes in, metal- or mineral-bearing raw materials that are used as feedstocks or material inputs * * * in setting emission standards, work practice standards, operating standards or other prohibitions or requirements or limitations under this section for such categories and subcategories. H.R. Rep. No. 101-952, at 339 (1990). According to the industry commenters, enormous amounts of limestone are fed into a kiln to manufacture clinker, and it is cost-prohibitive to import limestone from further away. If the plant's quarry contains limestone with high concentrations of mercury or high concentrations of organics, the kilns will emit more mercury or THC and potentially more organic HAPs. Because limestone with high mercury or organic emissions will result in higher HAP emissions, and it is not cost-effective to import limestone from far away, equating the lowest emitters with the best performing sources makes no sense in the context of cement facilities. It also would be squarely in opposition to the Joint Explanatory Statement., 141082=This is the same UPL equation that EPA used in more recent rulemakings. See 75 FR 32020 (June 4, 2010) and 75 FR 31905 (June 4, 2010). The value of \u201cm\u201d denotes the number of future observations, and it is used to calculate an estimate of the variance of the average of m-future observations. For example, if 30-day averages are used to determine compliance (m=30), the amount of variability in the 30-day average is much lower than the variability of the daily measurements in the data base, which results in a lower UPL for the 30-day average., 305296=Since that time, we have issued regulations for GHG emissions under the CAA through the light duty vehicle rule (75 FR 25324, (May 7, 2010)) and have finalized the greenhouse gas \u201ctailoring\u201d rule (75 FR 31514 (June 3, 2010)) and the Johnson memo reconsideration (75 FR 17004 (April 2, 2010)). As a result of these actions, as of January 2, 2011, GHGs will become \u201csubject to regulation\u201d under the Act. Accordingly, the Agency has now finalized a framework addressing the concerns that were the basis of our decision not to propose standards of performance for GHG emissions from this industry at the time we proposed this 8-year review action., 349853=Industry commenter 2844 stated that before EPA can determine a floor, EPA must define the following terms in regard to the selection of a best performer for new sources: Emission control; Achieved in practice; Best controlled; and Similar source., 638257=(4) You must conduct performance evaluations of each SO 2 monitor according to the requirements in \u00a7 60.13(c) and Performance Specification 2 of Appendix B to part 60. You must use Methods 6, 6A, or 6C of Appendix A-4 to part 60 for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations. The method ASME PTC 19.10-1981, \u201cFlue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,\u201d (incorporated by reference\u2014see \u00a7 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 6 or 6A of Appendix A-4 to part 60., 354285=Industry commenter 2841 stated that in previous MACT rulemakings, EPA used the five best performing facilities if the number of facilities was less than 30. Consistent with these prior rulemakings, the industry commenter stated that this approach should be used for this proposed Portland Cement NESHAP rule and that EPA needs additional data points in order to appropriately set limits for the industry as a whole., 125564=A second Court opinion of relevance to the Portland cement NESHAP amended here is Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F. 3d 1019 (DC Cir. 2008). In that case, the court vacated the regulations contained in the General Provisions which exempt major sources from CAA section 112(d) standards during periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction (SSM). The regulations (in 40 CFR 63.6(f)(1) and 63.6(h)(1)) provided that sources need not comply with the relevant CAA section 112(d) standard during SSM events and instead must \u201cminimize emissions * * * to the greatest extent which is consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices.\u201d The current Portland Cement NESHAP references the now-vacated rules in the General Provisions. As a result of the court's decision, we are removing the references to the vacated provisions and addressing SSM in this rulemaking. Discussion of this issue may be found in Section IV.A., 575100=Under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), this action is an \u201ceconomically significant regulatory action\u201d because it is likely to have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. Accordingly, EPA submitted this action to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under E.O. 12866 and any changes made in response to OMB recommendations have been documented in the docket for this action. In addition, EPA prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) of the potential costs and benefits associated with this action., 268521=The current standard for dioxins and furans is expressed either as a concentration, or a combination of concentration and temperature control at the inlet to the PM control device. Continuous compliance is determined based on demonstrating the measured temperature at the inlet to the PM control device does not exceed the limit established during dioxin compliance testing. This is because higher PM control inlet temperature can increase dioxin emissions. See 63 FR 14196, March 24, 1998. Based on a comment indicating that there can be an increase in short-term temperature fluctuations during startup (and shutdown), EPA is indicating in the startup standard that temperature measurements can increase by 10 percent during these periods., 162402=The subcategorization possibilities for mercury which we considered and rejected at rule proposal were the type of kiln, presence of an inline raw mill, practice of wasting cement kiln dust, total mercury inputs, or geographic location. See 74 FR 21144-21145. We likewise reject these bases in this final rules for the reasons already stated., 102140=This table is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather provides a guide for readers regarding entities likely to be regulated by this action. To determine whether your facility will be regulated by this action, you should examine the applicability criteria in 40 CFR 60.60 (subpart F) or in 40 CFR 63.1340 (subpart LLL). If you have any questions regarding the applicability of this final action to a particular entity, contact the person listed in the preceding FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section., 131369=In this action, we are amending the emission limits for mercury, THC, and PM from new and existing kilns located at a major or area source, and for HCl from new and existing kilns located at major sources. We identify these standards below for the emission sources in a typical Portland cement production process. We have applied the limits for existing and new sources in this final rule for mercury and THC to area sources consistent with CAA section 112(c)(6). As noted above, mercury is one of the pollutants specifically singled out by Congress in CAA section 112(c)(6), and THC is a surrogate for POM and PCB, which are also section 112(c)(6) HAP. See 63 FR 14193, March 24, 1998 (determination to control all THC emissions from the source category under MACT standards). Finally, Portland cement kilns are a listed area source category for urban HAP metals pursuant to CAA section 112(c)(3), and control of these metal HAP emissions (via the standard for the PM non-mercury HAP metal surrogate) is required to ensure that area sources representing 90 percent of the area source emissions of urban metal HAP are subject to CAA section 112 control, as required by CAA section 112(c)(3). The PM standards for area sources reflect MACT, as explained below., 939577=46. Summary of Responses to Requests for Water Impacts Information. August 5, 2010., 328519=Commenters provided no description of how their total facility approach would work in practice. Would a source that is a best performer for PM and worst for other HAP be in the pool? Would there be some overall summing of where the kiln fell for each pollutant? Would there have to be value judgments made among pollutants (is being a best performer for mercury worth more than for PM in a ranking process)? EPA evaluated an approach whereby every kiln was ranked for performance for each HAP and the results were summed with the lowest overall score being the best performer, and next lowest the second best, etc. (among other things yielding a tie for best performer with no non-arbitrary way to break the tie). Using this approach, and with the three lowest ranked kilns as the average of the best performers, standards (after applying the UPL equation) would be approximately 65 lb/MM tons of clinker for mercury, 90 ppm for THC (nearly four fold increase), and 0.12 for PM (over an order of magnitude increase). All but one kiln in the data base already meets the THC standard, 21 of 89 kilns would meet the mercury limit, and 27 of 46 kilns have stack test measurements less than the 30-day value for PM. See memorandum, \u201cTotal Facility Approach for Setting MACT Floors\u201d, August 6, 2010. [41] These inflated values, and especially the drastically inflated THC and PM values, simply do not reflect best performance., 925200=16. Letter, C. Lesslie, Ash Grove Cement to P. Tsirigotis, U.S. EPA, April 22, 2010., 805830=(e) For an affected source subject to a D/F emission limitation under \u00a7 63.1343 that employs carbon injection as an emission control technique you may substitute, at any time, a different brand or type of sorbent provided that the replacement has equivalent or improved properties compared to the sorbent specified in the site-specific performance test plan and used in the performance test. The owner or operator must maintain documentation that the substitute sorbent will provide the same or better level of control as the original sorbent., 114616=On June 14, 1999 (64 FR 31898), EPA issued the NESHAP for the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry (40 CFR part 63, subpart LLL). [4] The 1999 final rule established emission limitations for PM as a surrogate for non-volatile HAP metals (major sources only), dioxins/furans, and for greenfield [5] new sources total THC as a surrogate for organic HAP. These standards were intended to be based on the performance of MACT pursuant to CAA sections 112(d)(2) and (3). We did not establish limits for THC for existing sources and non-greenfield new sources, nor for HCl or mercury for new or existing sources. We reasoned that emissions of these constituents were a function of raw material concentrations and so were essentially uncontrolled, the result being that there was no level of performance on which a floor could be based. EPA further found that beyond the floor standards for these HAP were not warranted., 593277=The annual burden for this information collection averaged over the first 3 years of this ICR is estimated to total 79,790 labor-hours per year at a cost of $7.75 million per year. The average annualized capital costs are estimated at $61.7 million per year and average operation and maintenance costs are estimated at $192,578 per year. Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b)., 224532=EPA also has concluded that the facts here are distinguishable from those in other rulemakings in which it exercised its discretionary authority under section 112(d)(4). In the case of the Pulp and Paper MACT (63 FR at 18765 (April 15, 1998)), the risk analysis indicated, at the 95 percent confidence interval, that the maximum concentration predicted to which people were estimated to be exposed was 0.3 g/m 3, 60 times less than the inhalation reference concentration. This is a much lower value than present in the Portland cement risk analysis discussed above. In the case of the Lime Manufacturing NESHAP (67 FR at 78054 (Dec. 20, 2002)), there are two key distinctions. First, the technical information available to EPA covered 100 percent of all lime kilns in the U.S., which is not the case for the Portland cement risk analysis. Second, EPA did a worst case analysis as a supplement to the industry analysis and determined that the highest hazard index under that scenario was 0.21. Based on the EPA analysis determining a health based limit for Portland cement, if we were to allow the same level of risk as we determined in Lime NESHAP analysis, the health based emission limit would be 2 ppmvd, which is almost the same level as the MACT standard we are finalizing in this action., 174840=We did receive one comment from an environmental group requesting EPA explore fuel switching as a beyond the floor option. However, EPA thoroughly explored fuel switching as a control option in the 2006 rulemaking and determined that there were problems with fuel availability and the costs were prohibitive. See 70 FR 72340. EPA is not presently aware of facts that would justify a different approach in this final rule., 615232=Executive Order (EO) 12898 (59 FR 7629) (February 16, 1994) establishes Federal executive policy on environmental justice. Its main provision directs Federal agencies, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States., 357039=Comment: Several industry trade association commenters (2831 and 2901) stated that EPA retains considerable discretion on how to set MACT floors. The commenters supported the Agency's authority to set floor standards based on control efficiency, or any method as long as their method reasonably estimates the performance of the relevant best performing plants. There is nothing in the Court's decisions that requires EPA to use the straight-emissions approach favored in this rule. The commenter stated that the Court has expressly decided that a straight emissions or arithmetical methodology is not required. EPA's technology based approach that estimated performance rather than deriving the standards through an arithmetic-straight emissions approach is supported by the Courts, as long as it results in a reasonable estimate of the performance of the best controlled units. According to the commenter (2901), Brick MACT does not endorse a straight emissions approach; nor could it. To do so would mean that the Brick MACT Court was overturning the Chevron step one holding in Sierra Club and National Lime II, something that it cannot do., 391980=Response: We reject the industry commenters' assertions that PM CEMS have not been required via rulemaking because of unresolved fundamental technical or policy issues. Concerns about PM CEMS were identified and addressed prior to the January 2004 publication of Performance Specification 11 and Quality Assurance Procedure 2 for PM CEMS (69 FR 1786, January 12, 2004). As mentioned in that rule's preamble, \u201c* * * we believe that the PM CEMS field demonstrations completed to date encompass a range of operating conditions and emission characteristics * * *\u201d including those exhibited by sources such as cement kilns., 550659=Although the Morgenstern paper provides additional information about the potential job effects of environmental protection programs, there are several qualifications EPA considered as part of the analysis. First, EPA has used the weighted average parameter estimates for a narrow set of manufacturing industries (pulp and paper, plastics, petroleum, and steel). Absent other data and estimates, this approach seems reasonable and the estimates come from a respected peer-reviewed source. However, EPA acknowledges the final rule covers an industry not considered in the original empirical study. By transferring the estimates to the cement sector, we make the assumption that estimates are similar in size. In addition, EPA assumes also that Morgenstern et al.' s estimates derived from the 1979-1991 are still applicable for policy taking place in 2013, almost 20 years later. Second, the economic impact model only considers near-term employment effects in the cement industry where production technologies are fixed. As a result, the economic impact model places more emphasis on the short-term \u201cdemand effect,\u201d whereas the Morgenstern paper emphasizes other important long-term responses. For example, positive job gains associated with \u201cfactor shift effects\u201d are more plausible when production choices become more flexible over time and industries can substitute labor for other production inputs. Third, the Morgenstern paper estimates rely on sector demand elasticities that are different (typically bigger) from the demand elasticity parameter used in the cement model. As a result, the demand effects are not directly comparable with the demand effects estimated by the cement model. Fourth, Morgenstern identifies the industry average as economically and statistically insignificant effect (i.e., the point estimates are small, measured imprecisely, and not distinguishable from zero). EPA acknowledges this fact and has reported the 95 percent confidence intervals in Table 12. Fifth, Morgenstern's methodology assumes large plants bear most of the regulatory costs. By transferring the estimates, EPA assumes a similar distribution of regulatory costs by plant size and that the regulatory burden does not disproportionately fall on smaller plants., 220282=Based on further consideration, EPA now believes that the 2006 PCA study and analysis has the following deficiencies. First of all, not all cement plants were evaluated (the PCA study covered about two thirds of the plants in the source category), and among those not evaluated were cement plants with the most likelihood of posing risk at ground level from HCl emissions due to use of positive pressure baghouses with monovents or multiple short stacks. Secondly, the analysis did not consider the impacts of the co-emitted acid gases, an important consideration in determining an ample margin of safety. In addition, no data were provided, nor do we have data, on other pollutants in the vicinity of these cement facilities, or background concentration data for HCl to determine cumulative impacts of HCl emissions for these facilities. [32] EPA's analysis of 2009 could not improve on the PCA study, given the lack of robust emissions data for Cl 2, HF, and HCN, and the lack of any additional data for the cement kilns not included in the original study. As a result, EPA cannot ensure that the resulting derivation of 23 ppmv as a possible health-based emission standard for HCl would result in chronic ambient levels of acid gases that would not pose significant health risks. EPA has no data that would allow us to extend that analysis to cover all acid gases and all facilities., 627641=(3) Exceed 1.50 pounds of nitrogen oxide (NO X) per ton of clinker on a 30-operating day rolling average if construction, reconstruction, or modification of the kiln commences after June 16, 2008, except this limit does not apply to any alkali bypass installed on the kiln. An operating day includes all valid data obtained in any daily 24-hour period during which the kiln operates and excludes any measurements made during the daily 24-hour period when the kiln was not operating., 923756=13. Memorandum. Intra-quarry Variability Estimate, July 21, 2010., 109756=Section 112(c)(6) requires that EPA list categories and subcategories of sources assuring that sources accounting for not less than 90 percent of the aggregate emissions of each of seven specified HAP are subject to standards under section 112(d)(2) or (d)(4). The seven HAP are as follows: Alkylated lead compounds; polycyclic organic matter; hexachlorobenzene; mercury; polychlorinated byphenyls; 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofurans; and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloroidibenzo-p-dioxin. Standards established under CAA section 112(d)(2) must reflect the performance of MACT. \u201cPortland cement manufacturing: Non-hazardous waste kilns\u201d is listed as a source category pursuant to CAA section 112(c)(6) due to emissions of polycyclic organic matter (POM), mercury, and dioxin/furans. Consistent with the requirements of CAA section 112(c)(6), we set MACT standards for these pollutants. 63 FR 17838, 17848, April 10, 1998; see also 63 FR at 14193 (March 24, 1998) (area source cement kilns' emissions of mercury, dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzo-p-furans, POM, and PCB are subject to MACT)., 801867=(a) The owner or operator of a kiln subject to a D/F emission limitation under \u00a7 63.1343 must operate the kiln such that the temperature of the gas at the inlet to the kiln particulate matter control device (PMCD) and alkali bypass PMCD, if applicable, does not exceed the applicable temperature limit specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The owner or operator of an in-line kiln/raw mill subject to a D/F emission limitation under \u00a7 63.1343 must operate the in-line kiln/raw mill, such that:, 248921=We noted at proposal of the NSPS that adopting an output-based standard avoids rewarding a source for becoming less efficient, i.e., requiring more feed to produce a unit of product, therefore promoting the most efficient production processes. 73 FR at 34076. EPA therefore proposed that all of the NSPS (for PM, NO x, and SO 2) be normalized by ton of clinker produced, and later proposed the same parameter for the two standards in the NESHAP which are normalized, mercury and PM. 73 FR at 34076; 74 FR at 21140., 933455=36. RACT/BACT/LAER Clearing house Report for Portland Cement. November 25, 2009., 361025=Comment: Industry commenter 2844 stated that EPA's conclusion that section 112(d)(3) and/or Brick MACT requires or even permits the Agency to ignore the achievability requirements of section 112(d)(2) is an unreasonable reading of the statute and of Brick MACT. The Agency retains more than sufficient discretion to devise NESHAP standards that successfully bridge the tension between achieved and achievable in section 112's standard-setting provisions by appropriately using both subcategorization and variability methodologies., 111900=In Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 489 F. 3d 1250, 1257-61 (DC Cir. 2007), the Court vacated the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units (CISWI) Definitions Rule, 70 FR 55568 (Sept. 22, 2005), which EPA issued pursuant to CAA section 129(a)(1)(D)., 224019=Consequently, although EPA is declining to adopt a section 112(d)(4) risk-based standard for HCl emissions from Portland cement facilities for the sound policy reasons discussed herein, we further note that there remain technical issues as to the appropriateness of such a standard even if EPA were inclined to exercise that discretion. We also do not view ourselves as bound by the technical determinations made in the 2006 rulemaking for the reasons just explained., 378078=Industry commenters 2855 and 2900 disagreed with EPA's interpretation of the operating experience with mercury CEMS in Germany. The industry commenters stated that mercury CEMS are inaccurate and difficult to maintain. Further, mercury CEMS operating in Germany are subject to monitoring regulations that are different than the U.S. regulations and are used in a different regulatory context than that proposed by EPA. The monitors used in Germany, or those available from other European or Asian manufacturers were not able to demonstrate acceptable performance in the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Trimble County Mercury CEMS study., 327430=The reason EPA has long adopted the interpretation that the existing and new source MACT floors are to be applied on a HAP-by-HAP basis are that a whole plant approach likely yields least common denominator floors\u2014that is floors reflecting mediocre or no control, rather than performance which is the average of what best performers have achieved. See 61 FR at 173687 (April 19, 1996); 62 FR at 48363-64 (September 15, 1997) (same approach adopted under the very similar language of section 129(a)(2)). For example, if the best performing 12 percent of facilities for HAP metals did not control organics as well as a different 12 percent of facilities, the floor for organics and metals would end up not reflecting best performance. For new sources, not only would the floor reflect unoptimized control, but EPA would have to make some type of value judgment between control of organics and metals just to decide which source was best controlled. [40], 477498=Comment: Several industry commenters (64, 74, 75) expressed concerns that the proposed limits for SO 2 are too stringent. One industry commenter (64) recommends that EPA not include SO 2 limitations because EPA recognizes that there are only \u201ca few locations\u201d where the raw materials contain high levels of sulfur, and in those few situations State regulations already impose SO 2 emission limitations that require the type of technology EPA proposes as the basis for the proposed SO 2 limitations. The industry commenter states that EPA assumes that one out of five new kilns will be sited where the raw materials are high in sulfur, requiring an SO 2 scrubber or a lime injection system when in fact at existing plants there have only been a handful of situations where high-sulfur materials have been determined to justify wet scrubbers. According to the industry commenter, of 28 BACT determinations for SO 2 for cement kilns since 1998 reported in the RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse (RBLC), only 5 were based on wet scrubbers, and 1 specified a dry scrubber or hydrated lime injection while the majority required no add-on controls because of low-sulfur raw materials or reliance on the inherent process absorption of SO 2. The industry commenter states that the preamble information that the fact that only 5 kilns out of 178 kilns currently use a wet scrubber indicates that uncontrolled SO 2 emissions are rarely high enough to justify add-on controls., 257131=For kilns and clinker coolers, EPA proposed to require bag leak detection systems for fabric filters and an ESP predictive model to monitor performance of an ESP. In this final rule we are requiring the use of a PM CEMS for all PM control devices. We did receive comments on technical issues associated with PM CEMS, which we have addressed in the Comments and Responses Document in the docket to this rulemaking. As explained earlier, we continue to believe that these devices provide the most positive indication that a facility is actually complying with the PM emissions limit. We also note that we promulgated a requirement for PM CEMS in the 1999 final rule but deferred the compliance date until the establishment of performance specifications. These specifications have now been established as EPA Performance Specification 11., 649349=P = total kiln feed (dry basis) rate, ton/hr. For kilns constructed, modified or reconstructed on or after June 16, 2008,, 495301=We note that industry commenters have stated that some new facilities may be located in areas where there is not sufficient water to operate a wet scrubber. However, we are not mandating the use of wet scrubber technology in these regulations, and we believe that sufficient alternative controls exist for SO 2 controls that this issue would not preclude a facility from meeting these emissions limits. As previously noted, these alternative technologies include dry lime injection, injection of sodium compounds, selective mining, injection of a finely divided lime slurry, use of lower sulfur fuels, and careful screening of purchased raw materials. Regarding the industry commenter's statements that the emission limit and alternative percent reduction should be less stringent, EPA notes that the kiln upon which the emission limit was based actually operates at levels under 0.6 lb/ton clinker based on information supplied by another commenter (60). The same industry commenter states that the limit for the kiln was reduced in 2007 from 1.33 to 0.95 lb/ton following a production increase authorized by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. To support its statement that a 90 percent removal efficiency is too high, the industry commenter noted that three Holnam (now Holcim) plants use scrubbers that are designed to operate at less than 90 percent efficiency. Our data for the scrubbers at the Texas plant shows that the removal efficiency depends on the number of pumps in operation, with 91 percent efficiency when all four pumps are operating. The scrubbers at the Holnam facility in Michigan have not operated continuously due to various issues encountered. We also note that SO 2 scrubbers in the utility industry have consistently achieved 90 percent SO 2 since the 1970s. We see no technical reason that the same removal levels are not achievable in the cement industry. Therefore, where add-on controls are necessary to comply, scrubbers designed to achieve at least a 90 percent efficiency or greater are expected to be able to meet the 90 percent efficiency alternative; cement plants may be able to meet the emission limit by utilizing scrubbers with less than 90 percent efficiency or with lime injection if the uncontrolled SO 2 levels are at moderate levels (assuming that wet scrubbers are not needed to comply with other requirements, such as the HCl standard in the NESHAP)., 781551=13.Section 63.1343 is revised to read as follows:, 364256=Specifically, for mercury the standard reflects 30 days of data for all mercury inputs, reasonable estimates of control device performance (for the few controlled sources), plus a reasonable statistical methodology to account for variability (including variability of mercury content of kiln inputs). EPA also used a pooled variability factor (pooling variability for all kilns in the MACT pool), which increased variability estimates. Where commenters provided data showing that kilns' performance was underestimated because different inputs were used outside the sampling period, EPA adjusted those emissions estimates. EPA also used data on variability of kilns quarrying limestone from the same geologic formation as two of the best performing kilns to estimate intra-quarry variability of those two best performing kilns, and further applied this variability as part of the pooled variability. See IV.A.1.c of this preamble and 74 FR at 21142-44., 372408=Comment: Industry commenters 2844, 2845, and 2916 objected to EPA's interpretation of CAA Sections 112(d)(2) and 112(d)(3) and the Brick MACT opinion (Industry commenter 2845 provided a white paper as an appendix to their comments for the HWIMI MACT proposal, dated December 01, 2008.). The paper, titled \u201cImplications of the Brick MACT Decision on EPA's Discretion in Setting MACT Floors,\u201d discusses variability at some length. The paper's main points were:, 931515=31. Derivation of a Health-Based Stack Gas Concentration Limit for HCl in Support of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry, April 10, 2009., 260364=In light of the Sierra Club decision, EPA proposed to require that sources be in continuous compliance with emissions limits at all times, even during startup, shutdown, and malfunction. 74 FR at 21161-62. We proposed that these sources meet the same standards at all times. Id. We also specifically asked for information on emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction., 865448=(l) HCl Monitoring Requirements. If you are subject to an emissions limitation on HCl emissions in \u00a7 63.1343, you must continuously monitor HCl according to paragraph (l)(1) and (2) and paragraphs (m)(1) through (m)(4) of this section. You must also develop an emissions monitoring plan in accordance with paragraphs (p)(1) through (p)(4) of this section., 413855=Comment: Several private, State and environmental advocacy group commenters (59, 60, 63, 68, 70, 71, 72) approve of the proposed limits for NO X or believe more stringent limits are appropriate. One private commenter (59) states that the proposed standard is unjustifiably high, and will allow for greater NO X emissions than can be achieved with the installation of off-the-shelf pollution control technology. The commenter recommends a standard of no greater than 0.5 lb NO X/ton clinker and states that SCR is an effective and proven technology to reduce NO X emissions from cement kilns and can reduce NO X emissions from cement kilns by greater than 90 percent, consistent with what has been observed with SCR in other industries. According to the private commenter, SCR can achieve this performance with cost-effectiveness of approximately $1,500-$3,800/ton NO X, easily within regulatory cost thresholds for many NO X control programs. Regarding concerns over dust and plugging, the commenter cites three recent installations of SCR on cement kilns that show that SCR vendors can properly design and install units which manage the dust and successfully operate for many years. The commenter stated that numerous SCR companies believe that they can design and supply SCR systems for NO X control at cement plants where they will have to guarantee performance levels in legal contracts, and thus they would be at significant financial risk to advertise and sell an SCR system that was actually going to fail. The effectiveness of the technology to reduce NO X and other pollutant emissions from cement kilns, as demonstrated by the SCR installations on cement kilns in Europe and the numerous SCR installations on other heavy industries like coal-fired power plants and waste incinerators, is supported by the marketing, technical assessments, and reports prepared by numerous experts on this subject, including: Three (3) cement companies, five (5) SCR manufacturers, an independent blue ribbon panel, the U.S. EPA (twice), and the European IPPC. State commenter 68 believes that EPA's proposed NO X limit of 1.5 lb/ton clinker underestimates the reductions that are achievable with SCR technology and recommends that SCR be identified as BDT for this sector and is \u201cthe regulated future\u201d for cement kilns. The commenter states that the agency has noted that hybrid combinations of SNCR and SCR could be used in new cement kilns to achieve greater reductions than would be possible with SNCR alone. SCR is also named by EPA as available technology for cement kilns in the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Final Clean Air Visibility Rule or the Guidelines for Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) Determinations Under the Regional Haze Regulations. As far back as 1999, EPA included SCR in a list of control technologies available for both dry and wet cement manufacturing processes, as did a Pechan & Associates Report prepared for EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards in September 2005. Therefore, SCR technology for the cement manufacturing sector has been considered feasible technology by EPA for some time., 942927=54. Laden et al., 2006. \u201cReduction in Fine Particulate Air Pollution and Mortality.\u201dAmerican Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 173: 667-672., 278155=In determining the proposal date that determines if a source is existing or new, we have decided to select the proposal date of these final amendments, which is May 6, 2009, for all the standards., 274556=In response to comments urging that EPA not apply the same standards to malfunctions as to normal operation, EPA recognizes that even equipment that is properly designed and maintained can sometimes fail and that such failure can sometimes cause (or in the case of 30-day averages, contribute to) an exceedance of the relevant emission standard. (See, e.g., State Implementation Plans: Policy Regarding Excessive Emissions During Malfunctions, Startup, and Shutdown (Sept. 20, 1999); Policy on Excess Emissions During Startup, Shutdown, Maintenance, and Malfunctions (Feb. 15, 1983)). EPA is therefore adding to the final rule an affirmative defense to civil penalties for exceedances of emission limits that are caused by malfunctions. See 40 CFR 63.1341 (defining \u201caffirmative defense\u201d to mean, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding). We also added other regulatory provisions to specify the elements that are necessary to establish this affirmative defense; the source must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it has met all of the elements set forth in 63.1344. (See 40 CFR 22.24). The criteria ensure that the affirmative defense is available only where the event that causes an exceedance of the emission limit meets the narrow definition of malfunction in 40 CFR 63.2 (sudden, infrequent, not reasonable preventable and not caused by poor maintenance and or careless operation). The criteria also are designed to ensure that steps are taken to correct the malfunction, to minimize emissions in accordance with section 63.1348(d) and to prevent future malfunctions. In any judicial or administrative proceeding, the Administrator may challenge the assertion of the affirmative defense and, if the respondent has not met its burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense, appropriate penalties may be assessed in accordance with Section 113 of the Clean Air Act (see also 40 CFR Part 22.77)., 934657=40. Another industry commenter (2859) stated that it had three sources which were best performers for mercury and three other sources which were best performers for PM but that each would need to make upgrades for the pollutant not currently fully controlled. EPA views this as another least common denominator example whereby each of the floors would be diluted due to the coincidence that facilities are not optimizing control of all their emitted pollutants. See also Petitioners Brief in Medical Waste Institute et al. v. EPA, No. 09-1297 (DC Cir.) pointing out, in this context, that \u201cthe best performers for some pollutants are the worst performers for others\u201d (p. 34) and \u201c[s]ome of the best performers for certain pollutants are among the worst performers for others.\u201d, 936856=43. One industry commenter cited Tanners' Council of America v. Train, 540 F. 2d 1188, 1193 (4th Cir. 1976) for the proposition that technology-based effluent limitation guidelines under the Clean Water Act are not considered achievable \u201cwhere plants in EPA's database were `capable of meeting the limitation for some, but not all, of the pollutant parameters' \u201d. Tanners' Council involved a situation where EPA established standards for one source category based on a transfer of performance information from a different, unrelated source category. 540 F. 2d at 1192-93. Since the wastewater from the category from which the limits were transferred was easier to treat than tannery wastewater, the court was skeptical of EPA's undocumented assertions that the transfer of performance data (with certain upward adjustments) was permissible. Id. None of these circumstances apply here. EPA is not transferring performance from another category, but basing limits on documented performance of cement kilns. In addition, as noted in earlier preamble text, all of the kilns in the pool of best performers for each HAP is meeting the limit for that HAP, a strong showing of technical feasibility and technical achievability. Cf. CPC International v. Train, 540 F. 2d 1329, 1333 (8th Cir. 1976); American Meat Inst. v. EPA, 526 F. 2d 442, 458, 459 (7th Cir. 1975). Further, as discussed in the final part of this comment response, EPA has closely examined and is unaware of any situation whereby optimized performance for one HAP interferes with or otherwise precludes or impedes optimized performance for another., 931910=32. It should be noted that large amounts of site-specific information both on kiln operation and local meteorological information is needed to obtain meaningful results from AERSCREEN and other dispersion models. This information is in the ready possession of the industrial sources themselves, but for unknown reasons, was not provided by industry to EPA either as part of the 2006 PCA analysis or in response to subsequent data solicitations by EPA., 944635=57. U.S. GAO (Government Accountability Office). Demographics of People Living Near Waste Facilities. Washington DC: Government Printing Office; 1995., 390115=Comment: Two industry commenters (2845 and 2859) said that EPA has not promulgated any regulations requiring PM CEMS at any source category due to its inability to address fundamental technical and policy issues and must resolve these issues through rulemaking before requiring PM CEMS at any cement plants. Furthermore EPA has not performed a legitimate technical analysis of emissions variability and compliance determination uncertainty to allow the use of PM CEMS for determining continuous compliance with a PM limit at cement plants., 611891=This final rulemaking involves technical standards. EPA has decided to use the VCS ASME PTC 19.10-1981, \u201cFlue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,\u201d for its manual methods of measuring the content of the exhaust gas. These parts of ASME PTC 19.10-1981 are acceptable alternatives to EPA Methods 3B, 6, 6A, 7, and 7C. This standard is available from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016-5990., 365888=Floors for PM are based on multiple stack measurements which have been adjusted by reasonable statistical methodologies to account for variability. See IV.A.1.f of this preamble, responding to the argument that measurement by means of a CEM makes the standard more stringent. Moreover, the PM standard reflects performance of fabric filters with membrane bags, which are known to perform independent of inputs and to have relatively small operating variability. 72 FR at 54879 (Sept. 27, 2007); 70 FR at 59449 (Oct. 12, 2005)., 417372=One State commenter (60) states that the NO X emission limit should be lowered to 1.0 lb/ton of clinker on a 24 hour rolling average for new PH/PC kilns and a limit added of 2.0 lb/ton of clinker on a 24-hour rolling average if reconstruction or modification of the kiln commences after June 16, 2008, and the final configuration is a long wet kiln or a long dry kiln. The State commenter states that the recommendations regarding PH and PH/C kilns should apply equally to projects at greenfield sites and brownfield sites stating that many of the advances in NO X control in the U.S. and Europe have been made at brownfield sites whether they have involved new kilns or reconstruction or modification of existing kilns., 258948=As noted above, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated portions of two provisions in EPA's CAA section 112 regulations governing the emissions of HAP during periods of SSM. Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019 (DC Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1735 (U.S. 2010). Specifically, the Court vacated the SSM exemption contained in 40 CFR 63.6(f)(1) and 40 CFR 63.6(h)(1), that are part of a regulation, commonly referred to as the \u201cGeneral Provisions Rule,\u201d that EPA promulgated under section 112 of the CAA. When incorporated into CAA section 112(d) regulations for specific source categories, these two provisions exempt sources from the requirement to comply with the otherwise applicable CAA section 112(d) emission standard during periods of SSM., 240838=In addition to amending the PM standard for kilns we are similarly amending the PM emissions limit for clinker coolers. Fabric filters are the usual control for both cement kilns and clinker coolers. As EPA noted in our proposed revision to the NSPS (73 FR 34078, June 16, 2008), we believe that the current clinker cooler controls can meet the same level of PM control that can be met by the cement kiln. No commenter challenged this. One commenter did state that PM limits for clinker coolers should not be changed, but we disagree with that comment for the reasons previously discussed on the PM limit for kilns. Therefore, we are setting the same PM emissions limits and compliance requirements for both clinker coolers and kilns., 122685=In March 2007 the DC Circuit Court issued an opinion (Sierra Club v. EPA, 479 F.3d 875 (DC Cir. 2007) (Brick MACT)) vacating and remanding CAA section 112(d) MACT standards for the Brick and Structural Clay Ceramics source categories. Some key holdings in that case were:, 295428=We proposed a PM emissions limit of 0.86 lb/ton clinker based on fabric filters using membrane bags. This specific level was chosen because it is representative of the performance of this technology and was equivalent to the new source limit contained in the Hazardous Waste Combustor (HWC) NESHAP for cement kilns burning hazardous waste. This rationale is no longer applicable, since EPA is reassessing the PM limit in the HWC NESHAP. See USEPA Motion for Voluntary Remand in # 05-1441 (DC Circuit, August 29, 2008)., 517810=The control strategies likely adopted to meet the final standards for mercury, THC and HCl will also result in concurrent control of SO 2 emissions. For kilns that use an RTO to comply with the THC emissions limit, it is necessary to install an alkaline scrubber upstream of the RTO to control acid gas and to provide additional control of PM and to avoid plugging and fouling of the RTO. Scrubbers will also be used to control HCl and mercury emissions. Reductions in SO 2 emissions associated with controls for mercury, THC and HCl are estimated at 230 tpy, 11,200 tpy, and 98,400 tpy, respectively, so that total reduction in SO 2 emissions from existing kilns will be an estimated 95,500 tpy. The SO 2 emission reduction totals also include the reduction that will result from the final NSPS limit for SO 2. If we were to break out the NSPS SO 2 reduction separately, a new 1.2 million tpy kiln equipped with a scrubber will reduce SO 2 emissions by 190 tpy on average or about 14,300 tpy in 2013., 368744=Comment: Industry commenter 2844 stated that EPA cannot evaluate floors using methodologies that focus exclusively on technology if the resulting standards do not reflect actual average limitation[s] achieved (Brick MACT, 479 F.3d at 882). The industry commenter concludes that Brick MACT requires EPA to address the role of non-technological factors that impact emissions in setting floors and EPA must develop a methodology that accurately estimates the actual emissions achieved in practice by the best performing sources under a variety of operating conditions, taking into consideration testing and technological and non-technological variability. As proof that EPA failed to properly account for sources' variability in setting the standards, the industry commenter (and industry commenter 2845) included a chart purporting to demonstrate that the kilns comprising the pool of best performers for each HAP could not themselves meet the proposed standard., 170962=We understand that one of the two high emitting kilns has already installed activated carbon injection, but that its performance could be further optimized. See 74 FR 21148. The other kiln would have to install activated carbon injection and both kilns would need to install dust shuttling. The net benefit to the environment and public health would extend a number of years beyond the MACT compliance deadline., 922260=9. Development of The MACT Floors For The Final NESHAP For Portland Cement. August 6, 2010., 940201=48. Since Morgenstern's analysis reports environmental expenditures in 1987 dollars, we make an inflation adjustment to the engineering cost analysis using the consumer price index ((195.3/113.6) = 0.6)., 280521=We note that there are currently sources subject to new source limits for mercury and THC contained in the December 20, 2006, rule. However, the mercury the new source standards in this final rule are significantly different than the limits in the December 20, 2006, rule, and we do not see how the affected sources could have anticipated this change prior to proposal of these amendments. Accordingly, we have selected a date that allows these facilities to design and install the required control equipment., 139528=At proposal we adopted a form of the UPL equation that has been used in a previous rulemaking. 69 FR 21233 April 20, 2004. Commenters stated correctly that there was an error in the equation used at proposal. As a result of these comments, EPA corrected the formula in the final rule. The UPL used in the final rule is calculated by:, 598942=Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), 2 U.S.C 1531-1538, requires Federal agencies, unless otherwise prohibited by law, to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on State, local, and Tribal governments and the private sector. Federal agencies must also develop a plan to provide notice to small governments that might be significantly or uniquely affected by any regulatory requirements. The plan must enable officials of affected small governments to have meaningful and timely input in the development of EPA regulatory proposals with significant Federal intergovernmental mandates and must inform, educate, and advise small governments on compliance with the regulatory requirements., 849698=(f) Opacity monitoring requirements. If you are subject to a limitation on opacity under \u00a7 63.1345, you must conduct required emissions monitoring in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(vii) of this section and in accordance with the operation and maintenance plan developed in accordance with \u00a7 63.1347. You must conduct emissions monitoring in accordance with paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(iii) of this section and in accordance with the operation and maintenance plan developed in accordance with (p)(1) through (p)(4) of this section. You must also develop an opacity emissions monitoring plan in accordance with paragraphs (o)(1) through (o)(4) and paragraph (o)(5), if applicable, of this section., 309726=As previously noted, cement kilns are potentially subject to both the NSPS and the Portland Cement NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart LLL). In \u00a7 63.1356 of subpart LLL, we exempt any source subject to that subpart from applicable standards under the NSPS and the Metallic Minerals Processing NSPS (subpart OOO). That language was appropriate because the NSPS only regulated PM, and the PM limits in the NSPS and NESHAP were identical. At proposal, where the proposed new source PM limits in the NSPS and NESHAP were different, we proposed to add language in both the NSPS and the NESHAP to state that when there are emissions standards for a specific pollutant that apply to an affected source in both the NESHAP and the NSPS, the source should comply with the most stringent limit, and is not subject to the less stringent limit., 943914=56.

EPA Method 321 Detection Limits and Minimum Quantification Limit, July 26, 2010., 392700=Moreover, we disagree with the assertion that our analysis of PM emissions variability is not legitimate, yielding an overly-stringent PM emissions limit. The PM limit is based on our analysis of PM emissions from test data, adjusted from an hourly to a 30-day averaging period and further adjusted for variability. As mentioned in the preamble to the Credible Evidence Rule (62 FR 8314, February 24, 1997), we have addressed and continue to address concerns about perceived \u201c* * * limited number and distribution of test runs and the inherent variability in levels of emissions * * *\u201d by a number of approaches, including changing emissions averaging periods., 608535=EPA interprets Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) as applying to those regulatory actions that concern health or safety risks, such that the analysis required under section 5-501 of the Executive Order has the potential to influence the regulation. This action is not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is based solely on technology performance., 516023=Under the final limit for mercury, we have estimated that the emissions reductions will be 14,700 lb/yr for kilns subject to the exiting source emissions limits. For kilns subject to new source emissions limits, the emissions reductions will be 1,900 lb/year in 2013., 379624=Industry commenter 2855 disagreed with EPA's interpretation that mercury CEMS can be applied to the cement industry based on successful use on utility boilers. The commenter evaluated the following issues:, 942522=53. Pope et al., 2002. \u201cLung Cancer, Cardiopulmonary Mortality, and Long-Term Exposure to Fine Particulate Air Pollution.\u201dJournal of the American Medical Association 287:1132-1141., 238772=As we noted at proposal, some kilns combine the clinker cooler gas with the kiln exhaust and send the combined emissions to a single control device. There are significant energy savings (and attendant greenhouse gas emission reductions) associated with this practice, since heat can be extracted from the clinker cooler exhaust. However, there need to be different conversion factors from concentration to mass per unit clinker in these cases to allow for the increased gas flow, which result in a different PM emissions limit. We proposed adjustment factors that would account for these differences and create a site specific PM emission limit of this situation. See 74 FR 21155-56 and 21184. We received no comments on these factors and are thus adopting them as proposed, except that the factors have been changed to account for changes in the underlying kiln and clinker cooler emissions limits. Note that adjustments would also be necessary for kilns subject to the NSPS PM limit. Thus, we are including a cross reference for the NSPS to the appropriate section of the NESHAP rule., 225895=EPA also considers the alternative standard for total chlorine in the Hazardous Waste Combustor MACT (70 FR at 59555 (Oct. 12, 2005)) to be distinguishable. That rule, under the authority of section 112(d)(4) establishes a site-specific risk-based standard for total chlorine (of which HCl is the largest component), whereby, in lieu of meeting the MACT standard, sources may emit total chlorine at higher levels if they demonstrate that their emissions of total chlorine from all hazardous waste combustor sources at a facility do not exceed both acute (one-hour) and chronic (annual) exposure thresholds. The demonstration must account for all relevant site-specific conditions, or be based on worst-case screening assumptions. If sources satisfy these criteria, the amount of their total chlorine emissions is still capped by the technology-based limit to which these sources were previously subject. The site-specific demonstrations, applicability to all combustor sources at a facility, use of acute and chronic health benchmarks, and capping of emission limits are all unique to that rule., 128309=Section 111(b)(1)(B) of the CAA requires EPA to periodically review and revise the standards of performance, as necessary, to reflect improvements in methods for reducing emissions. We have conducted three reviews of the standards (39 FR 20793, June 14, 1974; 39 FR 39874, November 12, 1974; and 53 FR 50354, December 14, 1988)., 234975=EPA proposed use of PM CEMS as an alternative to using a bag leak detector, and also solicited comment on requiring their use generally. 74 FR at 21157. As we noted there, performance specifications for PM CEMS are now available, and continuous monitors \u201cgive a far better measure of sources' performance over time than periodic stack tests\u201d. After considering the public comments, EPA continues to believe that this is the case. See also further discussion of this issue at Section A.3 of this preamble below., 805210=(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, for an affected source subject to a D/F emission limitation under \u00a7 63.1343 that employs carbon injection as an emission control technique you must specify and use the brand and type of sorbent used during the performance test until a subsequent performance test is conducted, unless the site-specific performance test plan contains documentation of key parameters that affect adsorption and the owner or operator establishes limits based on those parameters, and the limits on these parameters are maintained., 934371=39.

Kilns (including any associated alkali bypass and clinker cooler) constructed, reconstructed, or modified after August 17, 1971 but on or before June 16, 2008 must conduct a performance test every 5 years if not equipped with a PM CEMS meeting the requirements of Performance Specification 11 of Appendix B to part 60., 394668=Comment: Two industry commenters (2845 and 2859) had the following comments concerning technical issues associated with application of PM CEMS. EPA has not addressed nor resolved the primary technical issues limiting the effective application of PM CEMS at cement plants including:, 348751=Industry commenter 2844 stated that EPA also has the discretion to define best performers as sources other than those with the lowest achieved emission levels. In the current proposal, the many difficulties associated with evaluating the impact of HAP content in the raw material inputs to mercury emission control and other factors could support a decision by the agency to establish a standard based on efficiency (i.e., a percent reduction standard) if not for the source category as a whole, then such a standard might be established for a particular subcategory as relevant, or as an alternative compliance strategy. EPA's discretion is sufficiently broad to encompass many reasonable decisions identifying and estimating the emission control of best performing sources on bases other than lowest emissions data, assuming the floor for the standard is based on a reasonable methodology estimating the percent reduction achieved in practice by the best performing sources under the reasonably foreseeable worst operating conditions., 330096=These types of results are at odds with Congress' purpose in adopting MACT floors. The central purpose of the amended air toxics provisions was to apply strict technology-based emission controls on HAPs. See, e.g., H. Rep. No. 952, 101st Cong. 2d sess. 338. The floor's specific purpose was to assure that consideration of economic and other impacts not be used to \u201cgut the standards. While costs are by no means irrelevant, they should by no means be the determining factors. There needs to be a minimum degree of control in relation to the control technologies that have already been attained by the best existing sources.\u201d A Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Vol. II at 2897 (statement of Rep. Collins). An interpretation that the floor level of control must be limited by the performance of devices that only control some of these pollutants effectively \u201cguts the standards\u201d by including worse performers in the averaging process, whereas EPA's interpretation promotes the evident Congressional objective of having the floor reflect the average performance of best performing sources. Since Congress has not spoken to the precise question at issue, and the Agency's interpretation effectuates statutory goals and policies in a reasonable manner, its interpretation must be upheld. See Chevron v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). [42], 471229=State commenters (60) and (72) state that the Holcim Untervaz plant in Switzerland achieves between 0.04 and 0.21 lb SO 2/ton using a wet scrubber despite, according to State commenter (72), the presence in the limestone of iron sulfide. Holcim initially installed a dry scrubber at the Untervaz plant in the late 1980's. Recent data provided by the State commenter indicate significant reductions in SO 2 emissions since 2002 largely due to the replacement of the older dry scrubber with a more efficient and economic wet scrubber., 117379=In response to the National Lime Ass'n mandate, on December 2, 2005, we proposed standards for mercury, THC, and HCl. (More information on the regulatory and litigation history may be found at 70 FR 72332, December 2, 2005.) We received over 1,700 comments on the proposed amendments. Most of these comments addressed the lack of a mercury emission limitation in the proposed amendments. On December 20, 2006 (71 FR 76518), EPA published final amendments to the NESHAP. The 2006 amendments contained a new source standard for mercury emissions from cement kilns and kilns/in-line raw mills of 41 micrograms per dry standard cubic meter, or alternatively the application of a limestone wet scrubber with a liquid-to-gas ratio of 30 gallons per 1,000 actual cubic feet per minute of exhaust gas. The final rule also adopted a standard for new and existing sources banning the use of utility boiler fly ash in cement kilns where the fly ash mercury content has been increased through the use of activated carbon or any other sorbent unless the cement kiln seeking to use the fly ash can demonstrate that the use of fly ash will not result in an increase in mercury emissions over its baseline mercury emissions (i.e., emissions not using the mercury-laden fly ash). EPA also issued a THC standard for new cement kilns (except for greenfield cement kilns that commenced construction on or before December 2, 2005) of 20 parts per million (corrected to 7 percent oxygen) or 98 percent reduction in THC emissions from uncontrolled levels. EPA did not set a standard for HCl, determining that HCl was a pollutant for which a threshold had been established, and that no cement kiln, even under conservative operating conditions and exposure assumptions, would emit HCl at levels that would exceed that threshold level, allowing for an ample margin of safety. EPA pointed to CAA section 112(d)(4) authority as its rationale for not establishing HCl emissions limits., 626952=(ii) 0.01 pound per ton of clinker on a 30-operating day rolling average if construction, reconstruction, or modification of the kiln commenced after June 16, 2008. An operating day includes all valid data obtained in any daily 24-hour period during which the kiln operates and excludes any measurements made during the daily 24-hour period when the kiln was not operating., 206761=We estimate the number of premature mortalities avoided each year due to the reductions in PM 2.5 exposure attributable to this standard to be in the thousands. RIA Table 6-3. We also estimate there to be over 2800 instances of annual cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity cases avoided, and hundreds of thousands of work loss days avoided. Id. The monetized benefits just from premature mortality avoided attributable to PM 2.5 reductions from this standard are estimated to be $7.4 billion to $18 billion at the three percent discount rate and $6.7 billion to $17 billion at a seven percent discount rate, nearly an order of magnitude higher than the rule's estimated social costs. See Table 13 below. Although MACT standards may directly regulate only HAPs and not criteria pollutants, Congress did recognize, in the legislative history to section 112(d)(4), that MACT standards would have the collateral benefit of controlling criteria pollutants as well and viewed this as an important benefit of the air toxics program. [26] The EPA believes these health and environmental benefits to be large and important and fully in keeping with the paramount goal of the Clean Air Act \u201cto protect and enhance the quality of the Nation's air\u201d (CAA section 101(b)(1)), and so is adopting MACT standards for HCl. [27], 362134=Comment: Industry commenter 2844 stated that EPA's floor setting methodology does not comply with three of Brick MACT's requirements: Floors must be based on emissions achieved in practice by best-performing sources; EPA's use of variability factors and methodologies to adjust reported emissions data must be based on demonstrated relationships, so that the floor setting methodology serves to reasonably estimate or predict the performance of the best performing sources; and EPA must consider the impact of nontechnology factors, such as raw material and fuel inputs, on a source's emission control levels., 610136=We estimate that under the final subpart LLL rule the additional electrical demand will be 1 billion kWhr per year and the natural gas use will be 1.2 million MMBtu for existing sources. At the end of 2013, electrical demand from new sources will be 180 million kWhr per year., 778993=New source means any source that commenced construction after May 6, 2009, for purposes of determining the applicability of the kiln, clinker cooler and raw material dryer emissions limits for mercury, PM, THC, and HCl, and the requirements for open clinker storage piles., 237764=The final PM emissions limit for existing sources is 0.04 pounds per ton (lb/ton) clinker for and 0.01 lb/tons clinker for new sources (30-day average). Kilns where the clinker cooler gas is combined with the kiln exhaust and sent to a single control device for energy efficiency purposes (i.e., to extract heat from the clinker cooler exhaust) will be allowed to adjust the PM standard to an equivalent level accounting for the increased gas flow due to combining of kiln and clinker cooler exhaust (an action for which EPA received no adverse comment). See 74 FR at 21156 and 73 FR at 64090-91 (Oct. 28, 2008) (explaining the equivalency of this standard and the energy efficiency benefits resulting from combining these gas flows). The PM standard is a 30-day rolling average and is measured with a CEM., 376941=Industry commenters 2588, 2844, 2845, 2846, 2858, and 2890 stated that EPA has no data showing that mercury CEMS are feasible on cement kilns and that emissions from cement kilns will likely be outside of the range of the current CEMS technology. The industry commenters stated that EPA must evaluate mercury CEMS through long-term field trials at cement plants in accordance with the proposed performance specifications and quality assurance procedures before imposing this regulatory requirement. The industry commenters proposed a mass-balance approach for monitoring, which is accurate and was used by EPA in setting the mercury standard., 341728=Response: EPA is forbidden by law from considering costs in determining MACT floors. NRDC v. EPA, 489 F. 3d 1364, 1376 (DC Cir. 2007); National Lime, 233 F. 3d at 640. Although one of the overall goals of the Act is to protect and enhance the quality of the Nation's air and resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of the population,\u201d CAA section 101 (b) (1), this overall goal does not somehow authorize EPA to adopt floors that either consider costs (overall or otherwise) or to base floors on other than what best performers achieve., 345407=Response: The industry commenter is citing to the \u201cJoint Explanatory Statement\u201d that accompanied the Conference Committee Report to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. This legislative history is of limited utility here. As explained at 353 F. 3d 388: \u201cThe Joint Explanatory Statement describes how the differences between the Senate and House were resolved in the Conference Committee * * *. The Joint Explanatory Statement may be helpful in determining Congress's intent, but does not carry the same weight as the Conference Committee Report itself.\u201dSee id. at 236-37. If there were some ambiguity in the statute, the Joint Conference Committee Report could shed some light on Congress' intent, but there is no exception to section 112(d)(2)(A)'s requirement that EPA consider \u201csubstitution of materials\u201d for each source category. Thus, the statement cannot be read to negate the express statutory command that MACT is to be based on, among other things, measures, processes, or systems which reduce the volume of pollutant emissions through substitution of materials or other process modifications. Indeed, EPA's attempts to identify best performers by ignoring the contribution of raw material inputs have been soundly rejected. Brick MACT, 489 F. 3d at 882-883. In fact, brick and ceramic production, like Portland cement production, involves extraction of mined material from a quarry located proximate to the production facility because transport of raw material over long distances is \u201cinfeasible\u201d. 489 F. 3d at 879. The language from the Joint Explanatory Statement no more allows EPA to ignore raw material contribution to Portland cement plants' HAP emissions than it did raw material HAP contributions to brick and ceramic plants' HAP emissions., 508938=We expect that by 2013, the year when all existing sources will be required to come into compliance, there will be 100 Portland cement manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico that we expect to be affected by these final amendments. Of these facilities, approximately 5 are complete new greenfield facilities. These facilities will operate 158 cement kilns and associated clinker coolers. We have no estimate of the number of raw material dryers that are separate from the kilns., 376685=Comment: Many industry commenters (2830, 2845, 2846, 2855, 2858, 2859, 2879, 2887, and 2890) stated that CEMS are not a proven technology and should not be required to determine compliance., 291925=At the time EPA proposed the 1.33 lb/ton clinker limit, we also considered a limit of 0.4 lb/ton clinker based on the average of recent BACT determinations for cement kilns. We chose the higher limit at proposal because the 0.4 lb/ton limit would have resulted in new kilns with moderate sulfur content raw materials experiencing a cost per ton of SO 2 removed of $6,000. However, we have changed our proposed decision for two reasons. First, as a result of the NESHAP requirement to meet a HCl emissions level of 3 ppmvd, we estimate that all new kilns will have to install wet scrubbers for HCl control. See section VI below. Hence, the cost of meeting the 0.4 lb/ton clinker limit in the NSPS is minimal, only the cost of the SO 2 CEM. Second, since proposal we have revised our costs for dry lime injection, which is the most cost-effective control technology for controlling a moderate sulfur raw material kiln to the 0.4 lb/ton clinker level. Based on our revised information, the cost of meeting a 0.4 lb/ton clinker emission limit now ranges from $470 to $1430/ton SO 2 for a kiln with high or moderate sulfur raw materials, even if these costs are attributed to the NSPS rather than to the NESHAP. Kilns with low sulfur raw materials can meet the 0.4 lb/ton clinker level with no add-on controls. We consider these to be reasonable costs, comparable with other costs for SO 2 control EPA has deemed reasonable such as those in the Clean Air Interstate Rule. See 70 FR at 25201 (May 12, 2005). So, even if a new facility is able to meet the NESHAP HCl limit without any acid gas controls, the cost per ton to meet a 0.4 lb/ton SO 2 NSPS limit is still reasonable., 887506=(b) The compliance date for existing sources with the PM, mercury, THC, and HCl emissions limits in \u00a7 63.1343(b) which became effective in November 8, 2010 will be September 9, 2013., 509483=Based on capacity expansion data provided by the Portland Cement Association, we anticipate that by 2013 there will be 16 kilns and their associated clinker coolers subject to NESHAP new source emission limits for mercury, HCl, and THC, and seven kilns and clinker coolers subject to the amended NSPS for NO X and SO 2. Some of these new kilns will be built at existing facilities and some at new greenfield facilities. The location of the kiln (greenfield or currently existing facility) has no bearing on our estimated cost and environmental impacts (since there are no longer separate standards for so-called greenfield new sources)., 637371=(2) You must conduct performance evaluations of each NO X monitor according to the requirements in \u00a7 60.13(c) and Performance Specification 2 of Appendix B to part 60. The owner or operator must use Methods 7, 7A, 7C, 7D, or 7E of appendix A-4 to part 60 for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations. The method ASME PTC 19.10-1981, \u201cFlue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,\u201d (incorporated by reference\u2014see \u00a7 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 7 or 7C of Appendix A-4 to part 60., 610547=Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (\u201cNTTAA\u201d), Public Law 104-113 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards (VCS) in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by VCS bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable VCS., 591108=The information collection requirements in this final rule have been submitted for approval to the OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The Information Collection Request (ICR) document prepared by EPA has been assigned EPA ICR number 1801.07., 353124=Comment: Several industry commenters (2845, 2846, 2874, and 2915) stated that EPA is proposing to calculate MACT floors by averaging the top 12 percent of sources for which CEMS data are available (even if that amounts to less than 30 sources), rather than by considering the top 12 percent of sources for which EPA has emissions information. As a result, EPA is proposing to establish the MACT floor based on data from only 2 sources. The industry commenters stated that CAA section 112(d) obligates EPA to set the MACT floor looking at no fewer than 5 sources, recognizing the value of relying on the maximum amount of data available., 588554=The final amendments to the NSPS for Portland cement plants apply to affected facilities constructed, modified, or reconstructed after June 16, 2008. The owner or operator of a new kiln is required to keep daily records of clinker production, install and operate PM CEMS, and operate NO X and SO 2 CEMS. These requirements are based on the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in the NSPS General Provisions (40 CFR part 60, subpart A) which are mandatory for all operators subject to new source performance standards. These recordkeeping and reporting requirements are specifically authorized by section 114 of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7414). All information submitted to EPA pursuant to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for which a claim of confidentiality is made is safeguarded according to EPA policies set forth in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B., 374658=Comment: A number of commenters including 2844 and 2845 argued that EPA should use an Upper Tolerance limit (UTL) rather than Upper Predictive Limit (UPL) statistical methodology to assess variability., 513902=In a Technical Memo to the docket, we provide a comparison of these models to provide an evaluation of how the differences between the models may impact the resulting estimates of the impacts of the regulation. For example, the Engineering Analysis and Economic Impact Analysis evaluate a snapshot of implementation of the final rule in a given year (i.e., 2013, based on 2005 dollars) while ISIS evaluates impacts of compliance dynamically over time (i.e., 2005-2013). In general, given the optimization nature of ISIS, ISIS accounts for more flexibility when estimating the impacts of the regulation. For example, when optimizing to meet an emission limit, ISIS allows for the addition of new kilns, as well as kiln retirements, replacements, expansions and the installation of controls. In the Engineering Analysis the existing kiln population is assumed to be constant even though normal kiln retirements occur. Based on these differences, the total control costs from the Engineering Analysis are higher than the total control cost estimated in ISIS., 129949=As a preliminary matter, EPA notes that certain portions of the existing rules are not being amended substantively but are being reprinted, sometimes with editorial changes, in today's regulatory text. As explained at proposal, EPA did so either for readers' convenience or to make certain non-substantive \u201cplain English\u201d changes to rule text. 74 FR at 21140. The final rule text makes these same non-substantive changes (which did not occasion public comment), and reprints certain existing provisions. Provisions from the existing rules which do not change substantively include the PM emission limits for kilns currently subject to the NSPS, the opacity limits for raw materials dryers, raw mills, and finish mills, and the limits for dioxin furan (D/F) for cement kilns. We reorganized the testing and monitoring requirements of both rules to make them more consistent, and modified the rule language to better conform with the June 1, 1998, Executive Memorandum on Plain Language in Government Writing., 351952=Comment: Industry commenters 2832, 2846, and 2890 stated that rather than selecting sources with the lowest emissions for particular HAP as best performing sources, EPA could use the relative performance of air pollution control technology to select the best performing sources, applying the best reasonable method for determining best-performers, which does not necessarily have to equate to lowest emissions., 108571=The Portland cement manufacturing source category was listed for regulation under this 1999 Urban Strategy based on emissions of arsenic, cadmium, beryllium, lead, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). The final NESHAP for the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry (64 FR 31898, June 14, 1999) included emission limits based on performance of MACT for the control of THC emissions from area sources. This 1999 rule fulfills the requirement to regulate area source cement kiln emissions of PCB (for which THC is a surrogate). However, EPA did not include requirements for the control of the non-volatile metal HAP (arsenic, cadmium, beryllium, and lead) from area sources in the 1999 rule or in the 2006 amendments. To fulfill our requirements under CAA section 112(c)(3) and 112(k), EPA is thus setting emissions standards for these metal HAP from Portland cement manufacturing facilities that are area sources (using PM as a surrogate). In this final rule EPA is promulgating PM standards for area sources based on performance of MACT, PM being a surrogate for these (and other non-volatile) HAP metals., 886942=21.Section 63.1351 is revised to read as follows:, 75223=3 actions from June 16th, 2008 to September 1st, 2010, 808667=18.Section 63.1348 is revised to read as follows:, 809001=(a) Initial compliance requirements. For an affected source subject to this subpart, you must demonstrate initial compliance with the emissions standards and operating limits by using the test methods and procedures in \u00a7\u00a7 63.1349 and 63.7., 199983=However, these measurements are very close to the detection limit for analytic method 321 actually calculated in the field for HCl\u2014from 0.2 to 0.3 parts per million by volume (ppmv) as measured in the stack. [25] The expected measurement imprecision for an emissions value occurring at or near the method detection level is in fact about 40 to 50 percent. This large measure of analytic uncertainty decreases as measured values increase: Pollutant measurement imprecision decreases to a consistent relative 10 to 15 percent for values measured at a level about three times the method detection level. See American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Reference Method Accuracy and Precision (ReMAP): Phase 1, Precision of Manual Stack Emission Measurements, CRTD Vol. 60, February 2001. Thus, if the value equal to three times the representative method detection level were greater than the calculated floor emissions limit, we would conclude that the calculated floor emissions limit does not account entirely for measurement variability., 231051=i. Floor Determination. At proposal we had compiled PM stack test data for 45 kilns from the period 1998 to 2007. EPA ranked the data by emissions level and the lowest emitting 12 percent, 6 kilns, was used to develop the proposed existing source MACT floors of 0.085 and 0.08 lb/ton clinker for new and existing sources respectively., 281524=For \u201cnew\u201d affected facilities constructed, modified, or reconstructed after June 16, 2008, the final emission limits amend the existing rules as follows:, 282625=The emission limits for affected facilities constructed, modified, or reconstructed before June 16, 2008, remain unchanged in this subpart. The rationale for these actions is discussed below., 795484=(d) If clinker material storage and handling activities occur 1,000 feet or less from the facility property-line these activities must be in an enclosed storage area that meets the emissions limits specified in \u00a7 63.1345., 178956=ii. Additional THC data received too late to be considered in this rulemaking. In addition to the THC CEMS data just discussed, we received another set of THC CEMS data from the Portland Cement Association (PCA). These data were not submitted to EPA until mid-June 2010, virtually too late for any consideration, much less considered analysis. This set consisted of THC CEMS data collected over periods ranging from 31 to 90 days for additional kilns not in the data base discussed above, as well as additional data from some of the kilns already in our data base. These additional data increased the total number of kilns with THC CEMS data to 30 kilns. The PCA also provided a floor analysis on this data set and recommended THC emissions limits. The data set as presented by PCA is shown in Table 4., 571256=This analysis does not include the type of detailed uncertainty assessment found in the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS RIA or 2008 Ozone NAAQS RIA. However, the benefits analyses in these RIAs provide an indication of the sensitivity of our results to various assumptions, including the use of alternative concentration-response functions and the fraction of mortality impacts at low PM 2.5 levels., 133441=In assessing sources' performance, EPA may consider variability both in identifying which performers are \u201cbest\u201d and in assessing their level of performance. Brick MACT, 479 F. 3d at 881-82; see also Mossville Envt'l Action Now v. EPA, 370 F.3d 1232, 1241-42 (DC Cir 2004) (EPA must exercise its judgment, based on an evaluation of the relevant factors and available data, to determine the level of emissions control that has been achieved by the best performing sources considering these sources' variability)., 507668=We are presenting a combined discussion of the estimates of the impacts for these final amendments to 40 CFR part 60, subpart F and 40 CFR part 63, subpart F. The cost, environmental, and economic impacts presented in this section are expressed as incremental differences between the impacts of a Portland cement plant complying with the amendments to 40 CFR 63 subpart LLL 40 CFR part 60 subpart F and the baseline, i.e., the standards before these amendments. The impacts are presented for the year 2013, which will be the year that all existing kilns will have to be in compliance, and also the year that will represent approximately 5 years of new kiln construction subject to the amended NSPS emissions limits. The analyses and the documents referenced below can be found in Docket ID Nos. EPA-HQ-OAR-2007-0877 and EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0051., 815850=(b) Continuous compliance requirements. You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the emissions standards and operating limits by using the performance test methods and procedures in \u00a7\u00a7 63.1350 and 63.8 for each affected source., 816256=(i) You must monitor and collect data according to \u00a7 63.1350 and the site-specific monitoring plan required by \u00a7 63.1350(o)., 143204=A number of commenters maintained that this final rule raises the (perceived) quandry voiced by Judge Williams in his concurring opinion in Brick MACT where an achieved level of performance for purposes of CAA section 112(d)(3) results in a standard which is unachievable under CAA section 112(d)(2) because it is too costly or not cost-effective. Brick MACT, 479 F. 3d at 884-85. EPA is of course mindful of the repeated admonitions (with accompanying vacaturs and remands) from the DC Circuit that MACT floors must reflect achieved performance, that HAP content of process inputs (raw materials and fuels) must be accounted for in ascertaining sources' performance, and that costs cannot be considered by EPA in ascertaining the level of the MACT floor. See, e.g., Brick MACT, 479 F. 3d at 880-81, 882-83; NRDC v. EPA, 489 F. 3d 1364, 1376 (DC Cir. 2007) (\u201cPlywood MACT\u201d); see also Cement Kiln Recycling Coalition v. EPA, 255 F. 3d 855, 861-62 (DC Cir. 2001) (\u201cachievability\u201d requirement of CAA section 112(d)(2) cannot override the requirement that floors be calculated on the basis of what best performers actually achieved). EPA is also mindful of the need to account for sources' variability (both due to control device performance and variability in inputs) in assessing sources' performance when developing technology-based standards. See, e.g., Mossville Environmental Action Now v. EPA, 370 F. 3d 1232, 1242 (DC Cir. 2004); National Lime I, 627 F. 2d 416,433-34(DC Cir. 1980). EPA has carefully developed data for each standard, assessing both technological controls and HAP inputs in doing so. For mercury, EPA used the pooled variance from all of the best performing kilns in the MACT floor pool in order to fully assess these kilns' intra-quarry and other variable mercury levels. EPA also used pooled variance to assess the variability of HCl and PM emissions for the MACT floor pool kilns. See 70 FR at 59438 (Oct. 12, 2005) (explaining when use of such pooled variances can be reasonable). EPA has also adopted 30-day averaging periods for all of the standards, further allowing short term fluctuations to be averaged out over the 30-day period., 629196=(i) 0.10 pound per ton of feed (dry basis) to the kiln if construction, reconstruction, or modification of the clinker cooler commenced after August 17, 1971 but on or before June 16, 2008., 246383=In the SCAQMD regulation, there are different requirements for active vs. inactive open clinker piles. An inactive pile is one that had not been disturbed for 30 consecutive days. In addition, the ACAQMD rule has different requirements for clinker piles that are 1,000 feet or less form the facility property-line. This 1000 foot criterion was a mutually agreed number among the stakeholders (both industry and environmental groups) involved in developing the regulation. [35] Given the lack of additional data, we saw no reason to change these criterion. More information on this rule is available at http://www.aqmd.gov/hb/gb_cal95.html., 928208=23.

EPA granted reconsideration of the new source mercury standard both due to substantive issues relating to the performance of wet scrubbers and because information about their performance in the industry had not been available for public comment at the time of proposal; that information is now available in the docket. We also committed to undertake a test program for mercury emissions from cement kilns equipped with wet scrubbers that would enable us to resolve these issues. We further explained that we were granting reconsideration of the work practice requirement banning the use of certain mercury-containing fly ash in cement kilns to allow further opportunity for comment on both the standard and the underlying rationale and because we did not feel we had the level of analysis we would like to have to support a beyond-the-floor determination. We granted reconsideration of the new source standard for THC because the information on which the standard was based arose after the period for public comment. We requested comment on the actual standard, whether the standard is appropriate for reconstructed new sources (if any should occur) and the information on which the standard is based. We specifically solicited data on THC emission levels from preheater/precalciner cement kilns. We stated that we would evaluate all data and comments received, and determine whether in light of those data and comments it was appropriate to amend the promulgated standards., 807068=17.Section 63.1347 is revised to read as follows:, 94218=These final rules are effective on November 8, 2010.

EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register. This action is a \u201cmajor rule\u201d as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

    "textAfterTable": "Industry commenters requested a higher limit, claiming that site specific properties of raw materials could create a situation where application of SNCR technology to a well designed preheater/precalciner kiln could not achieve the level of 1.5 lb/ton clinker without high ammonia injection rates that would result in significant ammonia emissions. To support their arguments they noted that EPA based the 1.5 lb/ton clinker level on the assumption that a well designed new preheater/precalciner kiln could meet a level of 3.0 lb/ton clinker without SNCR, so that this 3.0 lb/ton clinker should be the baseline from which performance of SNCR is evaluated. 73 FR at 34079. They pointed to several newer kilns that had difficulty meeting a level of 3.0 lb/ton clinker without SNCR, and attributed this difficulty to \u201chard to burn\u201d raw materials at certain sites. We have rejected the industry argument that 1.5 lb/ton clinker is not achievable for all new kilns using SNCR technology for the following reasons. First, the commenters note some kilns without SNCR cannot meet an NO X level of 3.0 lb/ton clinker. However, they did not provide the actual levels of NO X emissions the sources were designed to meet. The NO X emissions for a new preheater/precalciner kiln are primarily a function of precalciner design. Though two kilns may have the same basic precalciner design, certain site specific design parameters will also affect NO X emissions. A precalciner designed to meet a level above 3.0",
