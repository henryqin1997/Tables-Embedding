Originally restricted to the Lenani steppe, its speakers invaded Skouras twice, two milennia apart, generating three subfamilies. The first invasion took place around -50 Z.E., displacing the Mei peoples. The invaders gave the country its name, Skouras, and spread first to the littoral, then to the Mnau peninsula, and then across the southern sea to Gurdago. (All the letters in Skouras have their IPA values; so the first syllable rhymes with stow, not with scow or sue.) For more on the history and culture of the Skourenes, see the Historical Atlas of Skouras, or on a lighter note, the Skourene Culture Test. The second invasion was that of the T\u017euro, who originally lived in the eastern half of the Lenani plateau. On fire with the new religion of Jippirasti, they invaded Skouras in the 1600s.
