Forkhead-associated (FHA) domains were originally identified as a sequence profile of about 75 amino acids, whereas the full-length domain is closer to about 150 amino acids. FHA domains are found in transcription factors, kinesin motors, and in a variety of other signalling molecules in organisms ranging from eubacteria to humans. FHA domains are protein-protein interaction domains that are specific for phosphoproteins. FHA-containing proteins function in maintaining cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. FHA domain proteins include the Chk2/Rad53/Cds1 family of proteins that contain one or more FHA domains, as well as a Ser/Thr kinase domain [11106755, 12121644, 12049740].}",
