Being immersed in a highly culturally integrated campus has taught me a great deal on the importance of interactivity with young individuals both alike and unlike myself. My most memorable experience thus far has been this Spring semester, as I was granted the opportunity to study abroad with the Hopkins in Madrid program, which gave me an entirely new perspective on life and how I would like to take charge in changing the society we live today., 283468=Freshmen generally eat at the Fresh Food Cafe, referred to as the FFC. It is a standard buffet-style college cafeteria with usually delectable desserts. The Levering Food Court offers more appetizing options but is only open for lunch. Charles Street Market, or CharMar, is a good place to pick up late-night snacks but unless you're spending Dining Dollars (meal plan currency), it isn't really worth it. Sophomores usually eat at Nolan's, located in Charles Commons.}",

The school has a ton of resources available for use- you just need to be willing to reach out for them. Not much is done for you, so as long as you can speak up and ask for help, you will be able to access the wide range of opportunities open to you. Join groups, participate in events, and Hopkins will really feel like the right fit. Those who are open-minded intellectually and socially would really enjoy the school, for coming in with expectations only sets one up to be blind to outstanding possibilities. Also, Hopkins really caters to those students who are curious and ask questions, since the college supports an attitude of exploration and genuine interest. Tips for prospective students 1. Balance! The workload can be overwhelming at times, but don't let that stop you from staying social. Take advantage of the events",
