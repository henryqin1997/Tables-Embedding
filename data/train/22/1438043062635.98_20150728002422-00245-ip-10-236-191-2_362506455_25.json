The 1000 keyword is available only for 10/100/1000 Mb/s ports., 92074=The nonegotiate keyword is available only for SFP module ports. SFP module ports operate only at 1000 Mb/s but can be configured to not negotiate if connected to a device that does not support autonegotiation., 148078=This example shows how to set the interface speed to 100 Mb/s and the duplex mode to half on a 10/100/1000 Mb/s port:, 45876=Switch models include Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000-Mb/s) ports, 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports, and small form-factor pluggable (SFP) module slots supporting SFP modules., 45529=Ethernet interfaces on the switch operate at 10, 100, 1000, or 10,000 Mb/s and in either full- or half-duplex mode. In full-duplex mode, two stations can send and receive traffic at the same time. Normally, 10-Mb/s ports operate in half-duplex mode, which means that stations can either receive or send traffic., 93138=Enable half-duplex mode (for interfaces operating only at 10 or 100\u00a0Mb/s). You cannot configure half-duplex mode for interfaces operating at 1000 Mb/s., 34596=Port number\u2014The interface number on the switch. The 10/100/1000 port numbers always begin at\u00a01, starting with the far left port when facing the front of the switch, for example, gigabitethernet1/0/1 or gigabitethernet1/0/8., 141616=To configure 10/100/1000 port 4 on a standalone switch, enter this command:, 2146=To configure VLANs, use the vlan vlan-id global configuration command to enter VLAN configuration mode. The VLAN configurations for normal-range VLANs (VLAN IDs 1 to 1005) are saved in the VLAN database. If VTP is version 1 or 2, to configure extended-range VLANs (VLAN IDs 1006 to 4094), you must first set VTP mode to transparent. Extended-range VLANs created in transparent mode are not added to the VLAN database but are saved in the switch running configuration. With VTP version 3, you can create extended-range VLANs in client or server mode. These VLANs are saved in the VLAN database., 46916=Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000-Mb/s) ports support all speed options and all duplex options (auto, half, and full). However, Gigabit Ethernet ports operating at 1000 Mb/s do not support half-duplex mode., 34885=On a switch with SFP uplink ports, the module number is 1 and the port numbers restart. For example, if the switch has 24 10/100/1000 ports, the SFP module ports are gigabitethernet1/1/1 through gigabitethernet1/1/4 or tengigabitethernet1/1/1 through tengigabitethernet1/1/4., 91409=Enter auto to enable the interface to autonegotiate speed with the connected device. If you use the 10, 100, or the 1000 keywords with the auto keyword, the port autonegotiates only at the specified speeds., 33017=Type\u2014Gigabit Ethernet (gigabitethernet or gi) for 10/100/1000 Mb/s Ethernet ports, 10-Gigabit Ethernet (tengigabitethernet or te) for 10,000 Mb/s, or small form-factor pluggable (SFP) module Gigabit Ethernet interfaces (gigabitethernet or gi).}",

Entering a no switchport command disables and then re-enables the interface, which might generate messages on the device to which the interface is connected. Furthermore, when you put an interface that is in Layer 2 mode into Layer 3 mode, the previous configuration information related to the affected interface might be lost, and the interface is returned to its default configuration Note All Layer 3 interfaces require an IP address to route traffic.",
