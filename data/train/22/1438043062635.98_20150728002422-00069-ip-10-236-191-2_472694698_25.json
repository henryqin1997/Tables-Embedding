See, e.g., Clewell, 1986. Conjugative transposons and the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in streptococci. Annu. Rev. Microbial. 40: 635-659. As opposed to ordinary transposons, which can jump within a cell from one DNA location to another, conjugative transposons also encode the ability to bring about conjugation between different bacterial cells. Since plasmids typically require rather complex machinery for ca replication (often depending on successful interactions with host proteins) and must face additional problems of surface exclusion and incompatibility, conjugative transposons (which do not replicate, but instead insert into the chromosome or into a plasmid of the new host) appear to be an even more efficient and far-reaching way of disseminating a resistance gene. This may explain why the tetM gene of the conjugative transposon Tn916 has spread beyond the gram-positive species into gram-negative organisms, including gonococci and meningococci, as well as into mycoplasma and ureaplasma. See, e.g., Roberts, 1990. Characterization of the TetM determinants in urogenital and respiratory bacteria. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 34: 476-478. Other resistance genes, including those encoding resistance to erythromycin and kanamycin, are also found on conjugative transposons; these frequently contain or are related to Tn916. Such transposons may have evolved from a Tn916 ancestor; their emergence suggests the possibility of further dissemination of resistance among gram-positive organisms. Particularly ominous are reports of the vanB gene cluster within large conjugative chromosomal elements that appear similar, at least in function, to conjugative transposons., 149623=A preferred method involves the administration into the digestive tract of from 1\ufffd102 to 1\ufffd1010 viable bacterium or spore per day, in some embodiments from 1\ufffd103 to 1\ufffd106, in other embodiments from 1\ufffd106 to 1\ufffd109, and more preferably about from 5\ufffd108 to 1\ufffd109 viable bacterium or spore per day. Exemplary dosages range from about 1\ufffd103 to 1\ufffd106 viable bacterium per day, or alternatively range from about 1\ufffd106 to 1\ufffd109 viable bacterium per day., 121956=Bacillus coagulans, subspecies Hammer (ATCC-31284), was first isolated as a soil isolate at Yamanashi University in 1933 by Nakayama. Bacillus coagulans species are usually soil isolate. With the exception of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthraices, Bacillus species are known to be benign in the environment. To date, there have been no references of any species of Bacillus coagulans being involved in a pathogenic or opportunistic illness. Similarly, in an analysis of published data, there have also been no clinical trials that had been compromised due to pathogenesis by lactic acid-producing bacteria. In view of these facts, which are not disputed within the relevant scientific fields, Bacillus coagulans is safe as a therapeutic compositions., 182626=The plates showing 30-300 colonies were selected for counting. Plates possessing a very narrow variation in total colony count were counted and then an average count per plate was calculated. The number of viable cells per gram of sample was obtained by multiplying the average number of colonies counted per plate by the reciprocal of the dilution factor (e.g., if the average number of colonies per plate was 90 and final dilution factor was 2\ufffd10\u22126, then viable spore count was 90\ufffd(2\ufffd106) or 1.8\ufffd1010 viable spores per gram., 64995=As will be more-fully discussed below, Enterococci often acquire antibiotic-resistance through exchange of resistance-encoding genes carried on conjugative transposons, pheromone-responsive plasmids, and other broad-host-range plasmids. The past two decades have witnessed the rapid emergence of MDR enterococci. High-level gentamicin resistance was initially reported in 1979 (see, e.g., Horodniceanu, et al., 1979. High-level, plasmid-borne resistance to gentamicin in Streptococcus faecalis sub-sp. zymogenes. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 16: 686-689.), and was quickly followed by numerous reports of nosocomial infection in the 1980's (see, e.g., Zervos, et al., 1987. Nosocomial infection by gentamicin-resistant Streptococcus faecalis: an epidemiologic study. Ann. Intern. Med 106: 687-691). Simultaneously, sporadic outbreaks of nosocomial Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus facium infection appeared with penicillin resistance, due to \u03b2-lactamase production; however, such isolates remain relatively rare. Finally, MDR enterococci that had lost susceptibility to vancomycin were reported in Europe and the United States. See, e.g., Sahm, et al., 1989. In-vitro susceptibility studies of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 33: 1588-1591., 77757=Prior treatment with antibiotics is common in nearly all patients colonized or infected with MDR Enterococci. See, e.g., Montecalvo, et al., 1994. Outbreak of vancomycin-, ampicillin-, and aminoglycoside-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteremia in an adult oncology unit. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 38: 1363-1367. Other risk factors include prolonged hospitalization; high severity of illness score; intra-abdominal surgery; renal insufficiency; enteral tube feedings; and exposure to specific hospital units, nurses, or contaminated objects and surfaces within patient-care areas., 160485=Bacillus coagulans can be cultured in a variety of media, although it has been demonstrated that certain growth conditions are more efficacious at producing a culture which yields a high level of sporulation. For example, sporulation is demonstrated to be enhanced if the culture medium includes 10 mg/l of MgSO4 sulfate, yielding a ratio of spores to vegetative cells of approximately 80:20. In addition, certain culture conditions produce a bacterial spore which contains a spectrum of metabolic enzymes particularly suited for the present invention (i.e., production of lactic acid and enzymes for the enhanced probiotic activity and biodegradation). Although the spores produced by these aforementioned culture conditions are preferred, various other compatible culture conditions which produce viable Bacillus coagulans spores may be utilized in the practice of the present invention., 244126=Aminopeptidase profiling or activity has been used to differentiate bacteria and fungi to species and subspecies (see, e.g., Hughes, et al., 1988. LacZY gene modified peptidase activity in Pseudomonas aureofaciens. Phytopathology 78: 1502; Hughes, et at., 1989. Identification of immobilized bacteria by aminopeptidase profiling. Anal. Chem. 61: 1656-1660), as well as to define ecological niches of parasites and develop media for fastidious organisms. The recent development of a time-resolved, 96 well plate fluorometer provides a rapid and highly sensitive method to obtain peptidase profiles for microbial identification. See, Mossman, et al., 1997. Aminopepetidase profiling using a time-resolved, 96-well plate filter fluorometer. Appl. Spectroscopy 51: 1443-1446., 63845=Enterococci are also intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. Unlike acquired resistance and virulence traits, which are usually transposon or plasmid encoded, intrinsic resistance is based in chromosomal genes, which typically are non-transferable. Penicillin, ampicillin, piperacillin, imipenem, and vancomycin are among the few antibiotics that show consistent inhibitory, but not bactericidal, activity against Enterococcus faecalis. Enterococcus faecium is less susceptible to D-lactam antibiotics than Enterococcus faecalis because the penicillin-binding proteins of the former have markedly lower affinities for the antibiotics. The first reports of strains highly resistant to penicillin began to initially appear in the 1980s. See, e.g., Bush, et al., 1989. High-level penicillin resistance among isolates of enterococci: implications for treatment of enterococcal infections. Ann. Intern. Med. 110: 515-520; Sapico, et al., 1989. Enterococci highly resistant to penicillin and ampicillin an emerging clinical problem. J. Clin. Microbiol. 27: 2091-2095., 56863=Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens in the past decade. First reported in the United States in 1989, these organisms have rapidly spread throughout the country. VRE, particularly Enterococcus faecium strains, are often resistant to all antibiotics that are effective for treatment of susceptible enterococci. This situation has left clinicians treating VRE infections with either sub-optimal bacteriostatic agents (e.g., chloramphenicol) or no therapeutic options. Efforts to limit the spread of VRE through infection control measures and reduction of vancomycin use have had a limited effect., 51180=While the attachment of probiotics to the gastrointestinal epithelium is an important determinant of their ability to modify host immune reactivity, this is not a universal property of Lactobacilli or Bifidobacteria, nor is it essential for successful probiosis. See, e.g., Fuller, 1989. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 66: 365-378. For example, adherence of Lactobacillus acidophilus and some Bifidobacteria to human enterocyte-like CACO-2 cells has been demonstrated to prevent binding of enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, as well as Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. See, e.g. Bernet, et al., 1994. Gut 35: 483-489; Bernet, et al., 1993. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 59: 4121-4128., 21077=The gastrointestinal microflora has been shown to play a number of vital roles in maintaining gastrointestinal tract function and overall physiological health. For example, the growth and metabolism of the many individual bacterial species inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract depend primarily upon the substrates available to them, most of which are derived from the diet. See, e.g., Gibson et al., 1995. Gastroenterology 106: 975-982; Christl, et al., 1992. Gut 33: 1234-1238; Gorbach, 1990. Ann. Med. 22: 37-41; Reid et al, 1990. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 3: 335-344. These finding have led to attempts to modify the structure and metabolic activities of the community through diet, primarily with probiotics, which are live microbial food supplements., 73306=Colonization and infection with MDR enterococci occur worldwide. Early reports showed that in the United States, the percentage of nosocomial infections caused by VRE increased more than 20-fold (i.e., from 0.3% to 7.9%) between 1989 and 1993, indicating rapid dissemination. New database technologies, such as The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA, now permit the assessment of resistance profiles according to species. TSN Database collects and compiles data daily from more than 100 clinical laboratories within the United States, identifies potential laboratory testing errors, and detects emergence of resistance profiles and mechanisms that pose a public health threat (e.g., vancomycin-resistant staphylococci). Data collected by the TSN Database between 1995 and Sep. 1, 1997 were analyzed to determine whether the earlier increase in vancomycin resistance was unique to vancomycin, whether it represented a continuing trend, and whether speciation is quantifiably important in analyzing this trend. Enterococci faecalis resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin is uncommon. Little change in resistance prevalence occurred from 1995 to 1997. In contrast, Enterococcus faecium vancomycin and ampicillin resistance increased alarmningly. For example, in 1997, 771 (52%) of 1,482 Enterococcus faecium isolates exhibited vancomycin resistance, and 1,220 (83%) of 1,474 isolates exhibited ampicillin resistance. Enterococci faecium resistance notwithstanding, Enterococci faecalis remained by far the most commonly encountered of the two Enterococcal species in TSN Database. Enterococci faecalis to Enterococci faecium total isolates were approximately 4:1; blood isolates 3:1; and urine isolates 5:1. This observation underscores important differences in the survival strategies and likelihood of therapeutic success, in critical factors usually obscured by lumping the organisms together as Enterococcus species or enterococci., 27309=An embodiment of the present invention involves the administration of from approximately 1\ufffd103 to 1\ufffd1014 CFU of viable, Bacillus coagulans vegetative bacteria or spore per day, more preferably from approximately 1\ufffd105 to 1\ufffd1011, and preferably from approximately 5\ufffd108 to 1\ufffd1010 CFU of viable, vegetative bacteria or spores per day. Where the condition to be treated involves antibiotic-resistant digestive pathogens and the patient is an adult, the typical dosage is approximately 1\ufffd102 to 1\ufffd1014 CFU of viable, vegetative bacteria or spores per day, preferably from approximately 1\ufffd108 to 1\ufffd1010, and more preferably from approximately 2.5\ufffd108 to 1\ufffd1010 CFU of viable, vegetative bacteria or spores per day., 80288=Vancomycin resistance in enterococci is heterogeneous on many levels. Three phenotypes of vancomycin resistance (designated VanA, VanB, and VanC), each associated with a different ligase, are now well-described; a fourth, type VanD, has been recently reported. See, e.g., Noble, et al., 1992. Co-transfer of vancomycin and other resistance genes from Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 12201 to Staphlococcus aureus. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 93: 195-198. VanA- and VanB-type resistance is encoded by gene clusters that are acquired (i.e., not part of the normal genome of enterococci) and are often transferable. VanA-type strains are typically highly resistant to vancomycin and moderately to highly resistant to teicoplanin. This phenotype is often plasmid or transposon mediated and is inducible (i.e., exposure of bacteria to vancomycin results in the induction of the synthesis of several proteins that together confer resistance). See, e.g., Hiramatsu, et al., 1997. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clinical strain with reduced vancomycin susceptibility. J Antimicrob. Chemother. 40: 135-146. The VanA gene cluster has been found in a small Tn3-like transposon, Tn1546, and in elements that appear to be closely related (e.g., Tn5488, which has an insertion sequence [IS 1251] within Tn1546. See, e. g., Eliopoulos, et al., 1994. In vitro activities of two glycylcyclines against gram-positive bacteria. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 38: 534-541. These elements have, in turn, been found on both transferable and nontransferable plasmids, as well as on the chromosome of the host strain., 238639=Also provided herein are nearest neighbor (see, Saitou and Nei, 1987. Mol. Biol. Evol. 4: 406-425) and/or UPGMA (see, Waterman, 1995. In: Introduction to Computational Biology, p. 360-365 (Chapman and Hall Publishing)). Similarly, the \u201ctrees\u201d were generated using the alignment sequences matches providing the highest degree of sequence homology., 97874=These aforementioned Bacillus coagulans strains and their growth requirements have been described previously (see e.g., Baker, D. et al, 1960. Can. J Microbiol. 6: 557-563; Nakamura, H. et al, 1988. Int. J. Svst. Bacteriol. 38: 63-73. In addition, various strains of Bacillus coagulans can also be isolated from natural sources (e.g., heat-treated soil samples) using well-known procedures (see e.g., Bergey's Manual of Systemic Bacteriology, Vol. 2, p. 1117, Sneath, P. H. A. et al., eds., Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md., 1986)., 45827=It is now known that probiotic bacteria mitigate, or prevent the growth of putrefactive or pathogenic microorganisms by the process of competitive inhibition, through the generation of a non-physiologically conducive acidic environment (i.e., through the production of lactic or other biological acids) and/or by the production of antibiotic-like substances (i.e., bacteriocins), which are responsible for the bacteria's anti-microbial effects. See, e.g., Klaenhammer, 1993. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 12: 39-85; Barefoot et al., 1993. J Diary Sci. 76:2366-2379. For example, selected Lactobacillus strains, which produce antibiotics, have been demonstrated as effective for the treatment of infections, sinusitis, hemorrhoids, dental inflammations, and various other inflammatory conditions. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,439,995. Similarly, Lactobacillus reuteri has been shown to produce antibiotics which possess anti-microbial activity against Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, yeast, and various protozoan. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,413,960 and 5,439,678. Additionally, the proteolytic, lipolytic, and \u03b2-galactosidase activities of probiotic bacteria have also been shown to improve the digestibility and assimilation of ingested nutrients, thereby rendering them valuable in convalescent/geriatric nutrition and as adjuncts to antibiotic therapy., 171415=A typical yield obtained from the aforementioned culture methodology is in the range of approximately 1\ufffd109-1\ufffd1013 viable spores and, more typically, approximately 10-15\ufffd1010 cells/spores per gram prior to being dried. It should also be noted that the Bacillus coagulans spores, following a drying step, maintain at least 90% viability for up to 7 years when stored at room temperature. Hence, the effective shelf-life of a composition containing Bacillus coagulans Hammer spores at room temperature is approximately 10 years., 180513=In an embodiment of the present invention, the liquid containing the extracellular product may be formulated into a liquid ointment composition for use in direct application onto dermal, cuticular, or mucous membrane tissues. The liquid ointment was prepared by combining the liquid extracellular product produced above with, e.g., Emu Oil in a ratio of approximately 8:2., 96740=Various Bacillus coagulans bacterial strains which are currently commercially available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md.) include the following accession numbers: Bacillus coagulans Hammer NRS 727 (ATCC No. 11014); Bacillus coagulans Hammer strain C (ATCC No. 11369); Bacillus coagulans Hammer (ATCC No. 31284); and Bacillus coagulans Hammer NCA 4259 (ATCC No. 15949). Purified Bacillus coagulans bacteria are also available from the Deutsche Sarumlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkuturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany) using the following accession numbers: Bacillus coagulans Hammer 1915 (DSM No. 2356); Bacillus coagulans Hammer 1915. (DSM No. 2383, corresponds to ATCC No. 11014); Bacillus coagulans Hammer (DSM No. 2384, corresponds to ATCC No. 11369); and Bacillus coagulans Hammer (DSM No. 2385, corresponds to ATCC No. 15949). Bacillus coagulans bacteria can also be obtained from commercial suppliers such as Sabinsa Corporation (Piscataway, N.J.) or K. K. Fermentation (Kyoto, Japan)., 215457=The Biolog Microplate System\u2122 was utilized for microbial identification and characterization by carbon source pattern recognition of the Bacillus coagulans strains disclosed in the present invention. The aforementioned microplate technique allows for microbial characterization by use of 95 different analytical methods, thus yielding a total of 4\ufffd1028 possible patterns generated from a single microplate. Each strain of microorganism yields a distinct pattern, and the different species of bacteria will give different \u201cfamilies\u201d of patterns which can be recognized and differentiated by the Biolog Microlog\u2122 software. Analytical microplates for the Biolog Microlog\u2122 system are available for gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, yeast, lactic acid-producing bacteria, and E. coli/Salmonella analysis. In addition, further analyses may also be performed by use of additional selective media., 61694=Enterococci normally inhabit the bowel and may be found in the intestine of nearly all animals, from cockroaches to humans. In humans, typical concentrations of enterococci in stool are up to 1\ufffd108 CFU per gram. See, e.g., Rice, et al., 1995. Occurrence of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in environmental isolates of enterococci. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61: 374-376. The predominant species inhabiting the intestine varies. In Europe, the United States, and the Far East, Enterococcus faecalis predominates in some instances, and Enterococcus faecium in others. Moreover, of the 4 or more known enterococcal species (see, e.g., Devriese, et al., 1993. Phenotypic identification of the genus Enterococcus and differentiation of phylogenetically distinct enterococcal species and species groups. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 75: 399-408), only Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium commonly colonize and infect humans in detectable numbers with Enterococcus faecalis being isolated from approximately 80% of human infections, and Enterococcus faecium from the remaining individuals., 78390=Antibiotics may promote colonization and infection with MDR Enterococci by at least two mechanisms. First, many broad spectrum antibiotics have little or no anti-enterococcal activity, and administration commonly leads to overgrowth of susceptible (or resistant) Enterococci at sites at risk for infection. Second, most antibiotics substantially reduce the normal resistance of the intestinal tract to colonization by exogenous organisms. Colonization resistance results primarily from the \u201climiting action\u201d of the normal anaerobic flora, and to a lesser extent from an intact mucosa, gastric acid secretion, intestinal motility, and intestinal-associated immunity. Antibiotic-induced alterations in the protective flora of the intestine serve as a catalyst for colonization with exogenous pathogens such as MDR Enterococci. Antibiotic restriction programs would be more effective if they included prudent prescribing of all antibiotics, not just single agents (e.g., vancomycin). For example, use of this approach substantially decreased intestinal colonization with VRE in one hospital pharmacy that restricted vancomycin, cefotaxime, and clindamycin use. See, e.g., Quale, et al., 1996. Manipulation of a hospital antimicrobial formulary t control an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Clin. Infect. Dis. 23:1020-1025., 98480=Bacillus coagulans had originally been mis-characterized as a Lactobacillus in view of the fact that, as originally described, this bacterium was labeled as Lactobacillus sporogenes (See, Nakamura et al. 1988. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 38: 63-73). However, initial classification was incorrect due to the fact that Bacillus coagulans produces spores and through metabolism excretes L(+)-lactic acid, both aspects which provide key features to its utility. Instead, these developmental and metabolic aspects required that the bacterium be classified as a lactic acid Bacillus, and therefore it was re-designated., 143861=An embodiment of the present invention involves the administration of from approximately 1\ufffd103 to 1\ufffd1014 CFU of viable, vegetative bacteria or spore per day, more preferably from approximately 1\ufffd105 to 1\ufffd1010, and most preferably from approximately 5\ufffd108 to 1\ufffd109 CFU of viable, vegetative bacteria or spores per day. Where the condition to be treated involves antibiotic-resistant digestive pathogens and the patient is an adult, the typical dosage is approximately 1\ufffd102 to 1\ufffd10 14 CFU of viable, vegetative bacteria or spores per day, preferably from approximately 1\ufffd108 to 1\ufffd1010, and more preferably from approximately 2.5\ufffd108 to 1\ufffd1010 CFU of viable, vegetative bacteria or spores per day., 32751=In one embodiment, the bacteria is present in the composition at a concentration of approximately 1\ufffd103 to 1\ufffd1014 colony forming units (CFU)/gram, preferably approximately 1\ufffd105 to 1\ufffd1012 CFU/gram, whereas in other preferred embodiments the concentrations are approximately 1\ufffd109 to 1\ufffd1013 CFU/gram, approximately 1\ufffd105 to 1\ufffd107 CFU/g, or approximately 1\ufffd108 to 1\ufffd109 CFU/gram., 121240=Lactic acid-producing bacteria are a necessary component in fermented dairy products. Due to the fact that Bacillus coagulans was first isolated in 1932, has been used in the production of food products prior to Jan. 1, 1958, and has not been implicated in any pathogenic or opportunistic diseases since its isolation, it qualifies under as many as 9 sections and subsections of the United States Federal Registry for GRAS (Generally-Regarded as Safe) listing. The GRAS list simply indicates that a food additive is not thought to illicit any toxigenic or pathogenic response and is considered safe by those skilled in the art of food science, biochemistry, and microbiology., 66381=Among several phenotypes for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, VanA (resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin) and VanB (resistance to vancomycin alone) are most common. In the United States, VanA and VanB account for approximately 60% and 40% of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) isolates, respectively. See, e.g., Clark, et al., 1993. Characterization of glycopeptide-resistant Enterococci from U.S. hospitals. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 37: 2311-2317. Inducible genes encoding these phenotypes alter cell wall synthesis and render strains resistant to glycopeptides. It has been demonstrated, in the laboratory, that these genes can be transferred from Enterococci to other bacteria. See, e.g., Arthur, et al., 1993. Genetics and mechanisms for glycopeptide-resistance in Enterococci. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 37: 1563-1571. For example, Staphylococcus aureus has been rendered vancomycin-resistant through apparent transfer of resistance from Enterococcus faecalis., 49514=It has also been demonstrated that the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract affects both mucosal and systemic immunity within the host. See, e.g., Famularo, et al., Stimulation of Immunity by Probiotics. In: Probiotics: Therapeutic and Other Beneficial Effects. pg. 133-161. (Fuller, R., ed. Chapman and Hall, 1997). The intestinal epithelial cells, blood leukocytes, B- and T-lymphocytes, and accessory cells of the immune system have all been implicated in the aforementioned immunity. See, e.g., Schiffrin, et al., 1997. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 66(suppl): 5-20S. Other bacterial metabolic products, which possess immunomodulatory properties, include: endotoxic lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycans, and lipoteichoic acids. See, e.g., Standiford, 1994. Infect. Linmun. 62: 119-125. Accordingly, probiotic organisms are thought to interact with the immune system at many levels including, but not limited to: cytokine production, mononuclear cell proliferation, macrophage phagocytosis and killing, modulation of autoimmunity, immunity to bacterial and protozoan pathogens, and the like. See, e.g., Matsumara, et al., 1992. Animal Sci. Technol. (Jpn) 63: 1157-1159; Solis-Pereyra and Lemmonier, 1993. Nutr. Res. 13: 1127-1140. Lactobacillus strains have also been found to markedly effect changes in inflammatory and immunological responses including, but not limited to, a reduction in colonic inflammatory infiltration without eliciting a similar reduction in the numbers of B- and T-lymphocytes. See, e.g., De Simone, et al., 1992. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol 14: 331-340., 274049=A composition for inhibiting VRE growth contains a large concentration (i.e., 1\ufffd109 to 1\ufffd1011 CFU) of Bacillus coagulans vegetative bacteria and/or spores in combination with the culture medium (supernatant) in either an unpurified or semi-purified form. As with Bacillus coagulans vegetative cells and spores, the culture medium has also been designated a GRAS classification by the FDA. In order to reduce the overall volume, the medium may be partially- or fully lyophilized. Thus, the concomitant administration of both the vegetative bacteria/spores and a supernatant component of some type would serve to ensure that all possible probiotic inhibitory mechanisms (i.e., antibiosis, parasitism, competitive inhibition and microenvironment/pH modification) were covered by the administration of the, aforementioned therapeutic composition., 23007=The invention provides compositions, therapeutic systems, and methods of use which exploit the discovery that novel lactic acid-producing bacterial strains (e.g., the novel strains of Bacillus coagulans disclosed herein), or extracellular products thereof, possess the ability to exhibit inhibitory activity in mitigating and preventing the growth and/or colonization rates of pathogenic bacterial, particularly gastrointestinal pathogens such as antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacterial species including, but not limited to, Enterococccus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Campylobacter, Peptococcus, Heliobacter, Hemophylus, Staphylococcus, Yersinia, Vibrio, Shigella, Salmonella, Streptococcus, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Toxoplasmosis, and Rotovirus species, as well as mitigating the deleterious physiological effects of the infection by the pathogen(s). Preferably, the bacteria are probiotic. As currently defined, probiotic microorganisms are those, which confer a benefit when grow in a particular microenvironment by, e.g., directly inhibiting or preventing the growth of other biological organisms within the same microenvironment. Examples of probiotic organisms include, but are not limited to, bacteria, which possess the ability to grow within the gastrointestinal tract, at least temporarily, to displace or destroy pathogenic organisms, as well as providing other benefits to the host. See, e.g., Salminen et al, 1996. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek 70: 347-358; Elmer et al, 1996. JAMA 275: 870-876; Rafter, 1995. Scand J. Gastroenterol. 30: 497-502; Perdigon et al, 1995. J Dairy Sci. 78: 1597-1606; Gandi, Townsend Lett. Doctors& Patients, pp. 108-110, January 1994; Lidbeck et al, 1992. Eur. J. Cancer Prev. 1: 341-353., 51996=While the gastrointestinal microflora presents a microbial-based barrier to invading organisms, pathogens often become established when the integrity of the microbiota is impaired through stress, illness, antibiotic treatment, changes in diet, or physiological alterations within the G.I. tract. For example, Bifidobacteria are known to be involved in resisting the colonization of pathogens in the large intestine. See, e.g., Yamazaki, et al., 1982. Bifidobacteria and Microflora 1: 55-60. Similarly, the administration of Bifidobacteria breve to children with Fat gastroenteritis eradicated the causative pathogenic bacteria (i.e., Campylobacter jejuni) from their stools (see e.g., Tojo, 1987. Acta Pediair. Jpn. 29: 160-167) and supplementation of infant formula milk with Bifidobacteria bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus was found to reduce rotavirus shedding and episodes of diarrhea in children who were hospitalized (see e.g., Saavedra, 1994. The Lancet 344: 1046-109., 47243=Probiotics have also been shown to possess anti-mutagenic properties. For example, Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria have been demonstrated to bind mutagenic pyrolysates which are produced during cooking at a high temperature. Studies performed with lactic acid producing bacteria has shown that these bacteria may be either living or dead, due to the fact that the process occurs by adsorption of mutagenic pyrolysates to the carbohydrate polymers present in the bacterial cell wall. See, e.g., Zang, et al., 1990. J Dairy Sci. 73: 2702-2710. Lactobacilli have also been shown to degrade carcinogens (e.g., N-nitrosamines), which may serve an important role if the process is subsequently found to occur at the level of the mucosal surface. See, e.g., Rowland and Grasso, 1986. Appl. Microbiol. 29: 7-12. Additionally, the co-administration of lactulose and Bifidobacteria longum to rats injected with the carcinogen azoxymethane was demonstrated to reduce intestinal aberrant crypt foci, which are generally considered to be pre-neoplastic markers. See, e.g., Challa, et al., 1997. Carcinogenesis 18: 5175-21. Purified cell walls of Bifidobacteria may also possess anti-tumorigenic activities in that the cell wall of Bifidobacteria infantis induces the activation of phagocytes to destroy growing tumor cells. See, e.g., Sekine, et al., 1994. Bifidobacteria and Microflora 13: 65-77. Bifidobavcteria probiotics have also been shown to reduce colon carcinogensis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in mice when concomitantly administered with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS; see e.g., Koo and Rao, 1991. Nutrit. Rev. 51: 137-146), as well as inhibiting liver and mammary tumors in rats (see e.g., Reddy and Rivenson, 1993. Cancer Res. 53: 3914-3918) Interestingly, populations at high risk for colon cancer have been found to harbor gut flora, which efficiently metabolize steroids and hydrolyze glucuronides while concomitantly producing carcinogens (e.g., nitrosamines). A diet containing large concentrations of viable, lactic acid-producing bacteria was found to significantly lower these deleterious bacterial-mediated activities in such individuals., 239268=Species Level: This indicates a species level match. A 16S rRNA sequence homology of greater than 99% is indicative of a species level match (see, Staekebrandt and Goebel, 1994. Taxonomic Note: A Place for DNA\u2014DNA Reassociation and 16S rRNA Sequence Analysis in the Present Species Definition in Bacteriology. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44: 846-849)., 55908=Another deleterious result of indiscriminate use of anti-microbial agents is the generation of multiple antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacterial stains. See, e.g., Mitchell, 1998. The Lancet 352: 462-463. For example, a meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aurous (MRSA) strain was responsible for over 50 deaths in a single Australian hospital. See, Shannon, 1998. Lancet 352: 490-491. However, these initial reports of MRSA infections have been over-shadowed by the more recent outbreaks of multiple drug resistant (MDR) strains of Enterococci, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). Vancomycin is generally regarded as an antibiotic of \u201clast resort\u201d. The development of such resistance has led to numerous reports of systemic infections which remained untreatable with conventional antibiotic therapies., 69137=The best-characterized system of conjugation involves pheromone oligopeptides and pheromone-responsive plasmids. See, e.g., Clewell and Keith, 1989. Sex pheromones and plasmid transferin Enterococcus faecalis. Plasmid 21: 175-184. In this conjugation system, strains of Enterococcus faecalis typically secrete into the culture medium a number of different small, oligopeptide sex pheromones which are specific for different types of plasmids. When a cell containing a pheromone-responsive plasmid (i.e., the potential donor cell) comes into contact with its corresponding pheromone, transcription of a gene on the plasmid is turned on, resulting in the synthesis of an aggregation substance on the surface of its cell membrane. When the donor cell, in turn, comes in contact with another Enterococcus faecalis bacterium, the aggregation substance (which contains two Arg-Gly-Asp motifs adheres to the binding substance on the surface of most Enterococcus faecalis cells, causing them to aggregate. By a process, not yet well-characterized, the pheromone-responsive plasmid can then transfer from the donor bacterium to the other (recipient) bacterium. Once the recipient cell has acquired this particular plasmid, the synthesis of the corresponding sex pheromone is shut-off to prevent self-aggregation. This system of conjugation, which occurs primarily in Enterococcus faecalis, is a highly efficient means of plasmid transfer. Another system of conjugation, also not well-characterized, involves broad host-range plasmids that can transfer among species of enterococci and other gram-positive organisms such as streptococci and staphylococci. See, e.g., Clewell, 1981. Plasmids, drug resistance, and gene transfer in the genus Streptococcus. Microbiol. Rev. 45: 409-436. The transfer frequency is generally much lower than with the pheromone system. Since staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci share a number of resistance genes, these broad host-range plasmids may be a mechanism by which some of these resistance genes have spread among different genera., 245272=The Aminopeptidase profiling analysis disclosed follows the methodologies as set forth by Mossman, et al., 1997. Appl. Spectroscopy 51: 1443-1446. Each Bacillus coagulans isolate was initially cultured on Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) Agar plates for 24 hours before washing from the plate with 10 mM, pH 7, phosphate buffer. Table 16, below, illustrates the culture conditions of the various strains of Bacillus coagulans which were utilized in the present invention., 19965=This application claims priority U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/163,959, filed Nov. 8, 1999, entitled: \u201cISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PROBIOTIC STRAINS OF BACILLUS COAGULANS\u201d; and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/198,404, filed Apr. 19, 2000, entitled: \u201cADDITIONAL ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PROBIOTIC STRAINS OF BACILLUS COAGULANS\u201d, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 42464=While probiotic preparations were initially systematically evaluated for their effect on health and longevity in the early-1900's (see e.g., Metchinikoff, Prolongation of Life, Willaim Heinermann, London 1910), their utilization has been markedly limited since the advent of antibiotics in the 1950's to treat pathological microbes. See, e.g., Winberg, et al, 1993. Pediatr. Nephrol. 7: 509-514; Malin et al, Ann. Nutr. Metab. 40: 137-145; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,911. Unfortunately, the majority of these early studies on probiosis were observational rather than mechanistic in nature, and thus the processes responsible for many probiotic phenomena were not quantitatively elucidated.}",
