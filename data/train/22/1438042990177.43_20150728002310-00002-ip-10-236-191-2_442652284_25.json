            "Description",
            "ENDOSCOPE SYSTEM AND LENS UNIT - An endoscope system has a light source apparatus and an endoscope including an illumination optical system and an objective optical system. At least the objective optical system of the endoscope is provided with an adjustable diaphragm, and in a light path in one of the light source apparatus, the illumination optical system, and the objective optical system, an insertable/retractable filter for observation for special light is provided. The adjustable diaphragm performs a closing operation or an opening operation only when the filter for observation for special light is inserted into the light path.",
            "IMAGE PICKUP DEVICE, ELECTRONIC ENDOSCOPE AND LENS UNIT - An image pickup apparatus of the present invention varies optical properties by moving a part of lenses of an objective lens, and includes a solid-state image pickup device unit that is disposed at a rear-end section and that subjects a subject image to photoelectric conversion, a fixed lens frame that retains the objective lens that is disposed in front of the solid-state image pickup device unit, a movable lens frame that retains the part of lenses that moves along a photographing optical axis O inside the lens frame, and an actuator having one end connected to the movable lens frame and that moves the movable lens frame forward and backward. The actuator includes a rigid member provided so as to extend to the vicinity of the rear end at which the solid-state image pickup device unit is disposed and a shape memory alloy that is coupled to the rigid member.",
            "ELECTRONIC ENDOSCOPE APPARATUS - An electronic endoscope apparatus includes: an image pickup apparatus mounted at a distal end portion of an insertion portion; an operation portion provided consecutively at the insertion portion, with a frame member incorporated therein; and an electrical cable extended from the operation portion for connection with an external device. In the electronic endoscope apparatus, the frame member has a circuit board portion which establishes electrical connection between shields of the insertion portion and the electrical cable, and on which various electronic parts for exchanging signals with the image pickup apparatus are mounted. In spite of the arrangement of the image pickup apparatus that can acquire high-quality images at a distal end portion of the insertion portion, a size of the apparatus, in particular, a diameter of the insertion portion, can be prevented from being increased."

First, low-carbon steel is subjected to press processing of hot forging to form portions of irregularity on the face on a side of a hitting surface. Then, when there are projecting portions in the portions of irregularity, only the projecting portions are subjected to press processing of cold forging to crush the projecting portions to be flat. Then, the surface is slightly smoothed by machining to be flat and crystal grains at the portions of irregularity and the area therearound are pressed to be fined, thereby enhancing the hardness and forming fiber flows parallel to the hitting surface. A part of the hardened face becomes harder than the hardness of a base material before press processing by 10% or more within a range of 1 mm in a depth. 06-06-2013 Masato Kawauchi, Minato-Ku JP Patent application number Description Published 20150181920 METHOD FOR PRODUCING PROCESSED AQUATIC FOOD AND ENZYME PREPARATION FOR MODIFYING PROPERTY OF PROCESSED AQUATIC FOOD - By using a glucose oxidase and a metal-containing yeast, a processed aquatic food of which physical property is improved, and an enzyme preparation for modifying a property of a processed aquatic food can",
