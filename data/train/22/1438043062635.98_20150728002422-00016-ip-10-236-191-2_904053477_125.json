            "There is the occasional robbery here and there. These often times happen during early mornings and late nights so it would be nice to travel with a friend. The campus police usually reacts to distress calls fairly quick but the robberies, although very low, have become a nuisance.",
            "The university offers so many clubs that it makes your head spin. All you need to do is go there and since there's so many different clubs, it's hard to find something you're not interested in. The university always has something going on and, just like clubs, all you need to do is go there since a vast majority of these activities are free and fun to the bone.",
            "Make sure you use the Campus connector to get around since it's FREE. Look out for student discounts offered throughout various times of the year. Capitalize on your TCF bank account and your student ID combo, it could possibly save you a nice sum of money.",
            "There is quite a bit of options you have and since you're downtown (Minneapolis campus), you can enjoy many of the things that the urban life presents. Activities are always present but the only hard part is trying to find them, so don't feel afraid to look into events that perk your interest. There's always at least one guest speaker a week or some performance going on so keep up with the campus activities, it might not always be the funniest experience you've had but it's definitely a good way to meet new people and burn some free time.",
            "Typical dining experience as compared to other universities. A limited selection unless you plan on traveling but it gets the job done so there's really no need to complain. Dining spaces can range and you can basically eat anywhere that you can find a seat (good luck during exam times).",
            "The residential life is the best I've seen any Minnesota university can offer and with a wide variety students from around the world, you can bet that no greeting experience will ever be the same. The living spaces are nice and well built, which allows students personal quarters and a modern feel. There is a wide array of options when it comes to location, architecture, pricing so inconvenience should not be a problem.",
            "Once one starts off it's often times hard to turn off the switch and I'll guarantee that the university will keep you busy so don't be afraid to delve into your work sometimes. Although their is often times a heavier work load in higher level courses, remember that all your hard work will pay off even after your days in college. The school offers a variety of options when one feels confused, one should take advantage of this because these options are something to be valued.",
            "Even before you begin your journey into the college life meet and greet as many people as you can because these people will become your link to what's going on with things of relevance and could be eventual contacts to a future career. You will most surely want to explore as much of the campuses as you can because this place will be like a second home to you whether you like it or not, so it's better to do it now than wait. Most importantly, establish a routine so you can enjoy your experience at the U of M and ,more importantly, SUCCEED!",
            "First and foremost, this university is known for it's excellent academics and it does not disappoint. With a strong selection of majors and minors alike, one could feel overwhelmed but the school's friendly aura creates a welcoming atmosphere. As a final food for thought, this university allows students to not only blend their minds with their respective majors but also allows their actions to be heard as well."

However, make sure to apply before the priority deadline, usually in early December. Look up additional scholarships on the website., 43041=It is best to apply early to the University, usually before their priority deadline in mid December. Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved! You will have fun doing something you like while also meeting people. These people may become great friends later on or lead you to someone who can help you down the road in life., 147194=I can't think of a single student who found the academic rigor at the U of M to be lacking. Some courses will naturally be easier than others (especially 1000-level ones); however, those will be worth fewer credit hours in order to reflect that. Also worth iterating is the fact that the common misconception of science and math classes being more difficult is not necessarily true here; as a foreign language major, I can attest to the fact that As are not just handed out willy-nilly. All subject areas require work; there are no easy majors\u00e2??., 999561=The University of Minnesota is a very good school, it is ranked one of the top 10 research universities when I started attending in 2005. The classes are quite large and so you would need to develop a very healthy studying schedule to keep up with course work. That or you can visit the professors during office hours., 36546=The class content depends a bit on what the class is. Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants. Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation. All of that said, what someone learns depends mostly on that person's effort put into the class., 413694=On the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus we have the Weisman Art Museum. This building stands out from any other building on campus because of its postmodern architecture. It was just reopened in the fall of 2011 after it underwent a major expansion project. The museum now has many more works of art on display than it ever had before., 929488=I'd definitely give the University a 9.5 out of 10. I've actually been living here since the beginning of June and honestly I feel welcomed everyday I'm here. The University of Minnesota is full of fun, energetic, and friendly people that make up the rate 9.5, 347397=just a warning: the light rail won't be done until 2015 which blocks off all of washington ave., 770830=There's lots of cheap dates. There's a telescope on the physics building that is free to use after 8 o'clock and they show free movies in one of the buildings before the movies come out on video., 1062419=There are crime alerts that go on and it is very convenient that the university will text you on your phone and email you. Also you can call someone walk with you at night if you feel unsafe, you just call an escort. In addition there is the Gopher Chauffeur that takes calls till 2:00 AM., 929067=If you want to get into the University of Minnesota feel proud. The U of MN had 43,000 applicants for the incoming class of 2017, and only 5500 applicants were accepted. Definitely take your application seriously and meet every deadline.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I was so scared as an incoming freshman, because nobody from my high school or town lived in the cities, so I thought I would never meet anyone. Believe me, when you get to school it is so easy to meet and get along with everyone on campus, and you can't let yourself worry for one second. Everyone is in the exact same boat as you are, and it will all go way more smoothly than you might be scared of. So just don't worry and have fun with it, because it is a serious step in life, but the U of M makes it so much fun and so easy to meet people, and you won't be alone at all, because you'll make such good friends even the first day you're on campus! Bang for the buck I would say, as all colleges, it is definitely pricey, but of all the schools I have visited and been to during the academic year, the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities offers so much more for your dollar. There are so many different kinds of people on campus, and groups and clubs for everything imagineable, so you are going to find everything you want and way way more for your dollar! The campus is so huge, everything about the classes and teachers is GREAT, and you'll make a million new",
