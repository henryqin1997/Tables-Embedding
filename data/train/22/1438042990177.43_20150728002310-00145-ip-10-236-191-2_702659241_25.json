The Board considered Mr. Bond\u0092s experience with ETFs and the fact that he was the founder of PowerShares., 863850=Incorporated by reference to Post-Effective Amendment No.\u00a0192, filed on January\u00a031, 2011., 133302=The Fund, after investing 80% of its total assets in securities that comprise its Underlying Index, may invest its remaining assets in securities not included in its Underlying Index and in money market instruments, including repurchase agreements or other funds that invest exclusively in money market instruments (subject to applicable limitations under the Investment Company of 1940 (the \u00931940 Act\u0094), or exemptions therefrom). The Adviser anticipates that it may take approximately three business days (a business day is any day that the New York Stock Exchange (\u0093NYSE\u0094) is open) for the Adviser to fully reflect the additions and deletions to the Fund\u0092s Underlying Index in the portfolio composition of the Fund., 856316=Incorporated by reference to Post-Effective Amendment No.\u00a037, filed on March\u00a024, 2008., 860835=Incorporated by reference to Post-Effective Amendment No.\u00a0128, filed on January\u00a022, 2010., 871395=Incorporated by reference to Post-Effective Amendment No.\u00a0334, filed on July\u00a011, 2012., 523894=An order to redeem Creation Unit Aggregations using the Clearing Process made in proper form but received by the Trust after 4:00 p.m., Eastern time, will be deemed received on the next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date and will be effected at the NAV next determined on such next Business Day. The requisite Fund Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount will be transferred by the third NSCC Business Day following the date on which such request for redemption is deemed received., 619351=The Custodian calculates and determines the NAV per Share as of the close of the regular trading session on NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that such exchange is open. NAV is calculated by deducting all of the Fund\u0092s liabilities from the total value of its assets and dividing the result by the number of Shares outstanding, rounding to the nearest cent. All valuations are subject to review by the Trust\u0092s Board or its delegate. In determining NAV, expenses are accrued and applied daily, and securities and other assets for which market quotations are available are valued at market value. Securities listed or traded on an exchange generally are valued at the last sales price or official closing price of the exchange where the security primarily is traded. Debt and securities not listed on an exchange normally are valued on the basis of prices provided by independent pricing services. The Adviser may use various pricing services or discontinue the use of any pricing service at any time. When price quotes are not readily available, securities will be valued using pricing provided from independent pricing services or by another method that the Adviser, in its judgment, believes will better reflect the securities\u0092 fair value in accordance with the Trust\u0092s valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board., 613576=Distributions of ordinary income paid to shareholders who are nonresident aliens or foreign entities that are not effectively connected to the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. generally will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax unless a reduced rate of withholding or a withholding exemption is provided under applicable treaty law. However, shareholders who are nonresident aliens or foreign entities generally will not be subject to U.S. withholding or income tax on gains realized on the sale of Shares or on dividends from capital gains unless (i) such gain or capital gain dividend is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. or (ii) in the case of an individual shareholder, the shareholder is present in the U.S. for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the year of the sale or capital gain dividend and certain other conditions are met. For such shareholders, gains on the sale of Shares and dividends that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. generally will be subject to U.S. federal net income taxation at regular income tax rates. Furthermore, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2012 (or later date if extended by the U.S. Congress), the Fund may, under certain circumstances, designate all or a portion of a dividend as an \u0093interest-related dividend\u0094 or a \u0093short-term capital gain dividend.\u0094 An interest-related dividend that is received by a nonresident alien or foreign entity generally would be exempt from the 30% U.S. withholding tax, provided certain other requirements are met. A short-term capital gain dividend that is received by a nonresident alien or foreign entity generally would be exempt from the 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless the foreign person is a nonresident alien individual present in the U.S. for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the taxable year. Nonresident shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the applicability of the U.S. withholding tax. Nonresident aliens also may be subject to U.S. estate tax., 236781=(2)\u00a0\u00a0Borrow money, except that the Fund may (i)\u00a0borrow money from banks for temporary or emergency purposes (but not for leverage or the purchase of investments) up to 10% of its total assets and (ii)\u00a0make other investments or engage in other transactions permissible under the 1940 Act that may involve a borrowing, provided that the combination of (i)\u00a0and (ii)\u00a0shall not exceed 331/3% of the value of the Fund\u0092s total assets (including the amount borrowed), less the Fund\u0092s liabilities (other than borrowings)., 562912=11:00 a.m. (ET) Available Deposit Securities.

Fund Deposits made outside the Clearing Process must be delivered through a DTC Participant that has executed a Participant Agreement pre-approved by the Adviser and the Distributor. A DTC Participant who wishes to place an order creating Creation Unit Aggregations to be effected outside the Clearing Process does not need to be a Participating Party, but such orders must state that the DTC Participant is not using the Clearing Process and that the creation of Creation Unit Aggregations will instead be effected through a transfer of securities and cash directly through DTC. The Fund Deposit transfer must be ordered by the DTC Participant on the Transmittal Date in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of the Fund by 11:00 a.m., Eastern time, by the \u0093regular way\u0094 settlement date., 209980=Capitalized terms used herein that are not defined have the same meaning as in the Prospectus, unless otherwise noted.

The Fund will meet its 80% investment policy because it already is required to invest at least 80% of its assets in government bonds issued by emerging market countries that are included in its Underlying Index, in accordance with its principal investment strategies and the terms of its exemptive relief., 254552=In addition, the Fund\u0092s use of a representative sampling approach may cause the Fund not to be as well-correlated with the return of its Underlying Index as would be the case if the Fund purchased all of the securities in its Underlying Index in the proportions represented in such Underlying Index. It also is possible that, for short periods of time, the Fund may not replicate fully the performance of its Underlying Index due to the temporary unavailability of certain Underlying Index securities in the secondary market or due to other extraordinary circumstances. Such events are unlikely to continue for an extended period of time because the Fund is required to correct such imbalances by means of adjusting the composition of its portfolio holdings. It also is possible that the composition of the Fund may not replicate exactly the composition of its Underlying Index if the Fund has to adjust its portfolio holdings to continue to qualify as a \u0093regulated investment company\u0094 under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u0093Internal Revenue Code\u0094)., 182935=No entity that creates, compiles, sponsors or maintains an Underlying Index is or will be an affiliated person, as defined in Section\u00a02(a)(3)\u00a0of the 1940 Act, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, of the Trust, the Adviser, the Distributor or a promoter of the Fund., 372056=Secretary, PowerShares Exchange-Traded Fund Trust, PowerShares Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II, PowerShares India Exchange-Traded Fund Trust, and PowerShares Actively Managed Exchange-Traded Fund Trust; Head of Legal, Invesco PowerShares Capital Management LLC (2010-Present); formerly, Partner, K&L Gates LLP (formerly, Bell Boyd & Lloyd LLP) (2007-2010); Associate, 193397=Broker-dealer firms also should note that dealers who are not \u0093underwriters\u0094 but are effecting transactions in Shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of Shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section\u00a04(a)(3)(C)\u00a0of the Securities Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section\u00a024(d)\u00a0of the 1940 Act. As a result, broker-dealer firms should note that dealers who are not \u0093underwriters\u0094 but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted with engaging in ordinary secondary market transactions), and thus dealing with the Shares that are part of an overallotment within the meaning of Section\u00a04(a)(3)(C)\u00a0of the Securities Act, will be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section\u00a04(3)\u00a0of the Securities Act.

Such transactions are advantageous only if the Fund has an opportunity to earn a greater rate of return on the cash derived from these transactions than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available and the Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when the Adviser believes it will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any interim increase or decrease in the value of the Fund\u0092s assets. The custodian bank will maintain a separate account for the Fund with securities having a value equal to or greater than such commitments. Under the 1940 Act, reverse repurchase agreements are considered borrowings., 26384=Explanatory Note:\u00a0 This post-effective amendment no. 336 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for PowerShares Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II (the \u0093Trust\u0094) relates to the creation of a new series of the Trust known as the PowerShares Fundamental Emerging Markets Local Debt Portfolio., 107937=Each month, the Index Provider reviews the composition of the bonds included in the Underlying Index and removes any bonds that no longer meet eligibility requirements.

In the latter case, the investor must look principally to the agency or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment, which agency or instrumentality may be privately owned. On September\u00a07, 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship. The United States Treasury has put in place a set of financing agreements to help ensure that these entities continue to meet their obligations to holders of bonds they have issued or guaranteed.
