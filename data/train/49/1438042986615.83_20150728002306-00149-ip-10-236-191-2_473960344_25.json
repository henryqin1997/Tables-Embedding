The \u201cImmediate Assignment Message Type\u201d field is just the octet: 00111111. (There are other patterns for assignment extended and rejected.) The 3-octet request reference contains first the exact content of the channel request and the rest enables the computation of the frame number (modulo 42432) in which the request was received. The channel description contains of course critical RF information., 69264=Early work relating to Wireless Location Systems is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,327,144, Jul. 5, 1994, \u201cCellular Telephone Location System,\u201d which discloses a system for locating cellular telephones using novel time difference of arrival (TDOA) techniques. Further enhancements of the system disclosed in the '144 patent are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,608,410, Mar. 4, 1997, \u201cSystem for Locating a Source of Bursty Transmissions.\u201d Both of these patents are assigned to TruePosition, Inc., the assignee of the present invention, and both are incorporated herein by reference. TruePosition has continued to develop significant enhancements to the original inventive concepts and have developed techniques to further improve the accuracy of Wireless Location Systems while significantly reducing the cost of these systems. Patents relating to such enhancements include, but are not necessarily limited to: U.S. Pat. No. 6,091,362, Jul. 18, 2000, \u201cBandwidth Synthesis for Wireless Location System\u201d; U.S. Pat. No. 6,097,336, Aug. 1, 2000, \u201cMethod for Improving the Accuracy of a Wireless Location System\u201d; U.S. Pat.

No. 6,184,829 B1, Feb. 6, 2001, \u201cCalibration for Wireless Location System.\u201d, 71500=The inventors have conducted extensive experiments with the Wireless Location System technology to demonstrate both the viability and value of the technology. For example, several experiments were conducted during several months of 1995 and 1996 in the cities of Philadelphia and Baltimore to verify the system's ability to mitigate multipath in large urban environments. Then, in 1996 the inventors constructed a system in Houston that was used to test the technology's effectiveness in that area and its ability to interface directly with E9-1-1 systems. Then, in 1997, the system was tested in a 350 square mile area in New Jersey and was used to locate real 9-1-1 calls from real people in trouble. Since that time, the system test has been expanded to include 125 cell sites covering an area of over 2,000 square miles. During all of these tests, techniques discussed and disclosed herein were tested for effectiveness and further developed, and the system has been demonstrated to overcome the limitations of other approaches that have been proposed for locating wireless telephones., 68053=This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/539,352, filed Mar. 31, 2000, \u201cCentralized Database for a Wireless Location System,\u201d now U.S. Pat. No. 6,317,604 B1 issued Nov. 13, 2001, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/227,764, filed Jan. 8, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,829 B1, Feb. 6, 2001, \u201cCalibration for Wireless Location System.\u201d, 72609=The value and importance of the Wireless Location System has been acknowledged by the wireless communications industry. In June 1996, the Federal Communications Commission issued requirements for the wireless communications industry to deploy location systems for use in locating wireless 9-1-1 callers, with a deadline of October 2001. The location of wireless E9-1-1 callers will save response time, save lives, and save enormous costs because of reduced use of emergency responses resources. In addition, numerous surveys and studies have concluded that various wireless applications, such as location sensitive billing, fleet management, and others, will have great commercial values in the coming years., 321967=A network-based WLS uses geographically separated receivers to listen for signals from a roving transmitter. In a wireless communications network, the roving transmitter, in this case a wireless phone, can be broadcasting on any one of potentially thousands of control or traffic channels. A mechanism is needed for collecting this channel and caller information. We will now describe the subject invention, which provides a mechanism for communicating with the wireless system with minimal impact to the existing system by passively monitoring a specific link for cell ID, timing advance or PN offset, frequency, caller information and other information specific to a subscriber. (This is alluded to above in connection with the description of the AP\u2014see the subsection titled \u201cMonitor Internal Wireless Communications System Interfaces, State Table.\u201d) The specific link, e.g., may be the BSC-BTS link called the \u201cAbis\u201d link in GSM and other names by various manufacturers for other radio access system (AMPS, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, J-CDMA, CDMAOne, CDMA2000, W-CDMA, etc.). This information obtained from the link is passed to a TDOA, AOA, or hybrid TDOA/AOA -based location system that uses the information to acquire and process wireless phone signals for the purposes of location estimation., 482865=The AMS may have a connection to the Abis interface of a BSC in the GSM system. This connection may provide the AMS bidirectional monitoring access to the Abis interface for each BTS under control of the BSC. The AMS may monitor the LAPD signaling link for the beacon TRX, for each cell, to allow location upon origination of calls. The AMS architecture may expand to monitor the LAPD signaling links for each TRX, for all cells controlled by the BTS, to allow location using traffic channels. The AMS architecture may allow expansion to support up to 2000 LAPD signaling links. The AMS may detect call originations through the Immediate Assign Command. The AMS may identify emergency calls from the Immediate Assign Command., 338945=The most interesting fields here are those of the Request Reference. These are shown in more detail in FIG. 12D. The RA octet is the key information octet sent by the MS in the Channel Request and would contain the random identifier and the establishment cause, e.g., bit pattern 101 for 911. The other octets contain the coding of the absolute frame number modulo 42432 in which the access burst was received.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The true scope the present invention is not limited to the presently preferred embodiments disclosed herein. For example, the foregoing disclosure of a presently preferred embodiment of a Wireless Location System uses explanatory terms, such as Signal Collection System (SCS), TDOA Location Processor (TLP), Applications Processor (AP), and the like, which should not be construed so as to limit the scope of protection of the following claims, or to otherwise imply that the inventive aspects of the system are limited to the particular methods and apparatus disclosed. Moreover, as will be understood by those skilled in the art, many of the inventive aspects disclosed herein may be applied in location systems that are not based on TDOA techniques. For example, the processes by which the Wireless Location System determines TDOA and FDOA values can be applied to non-TDOA systems. Similarly, the invention is not limited to systems employing SCS's constructed as described above, nor to systems employing AP's meeting all of the particulars described above. The SCS's, TLP's and AP's are, in essence, programmable data collection and processing devices that could take a variety of forms without departing from the inventive concepts disclosed herein. Given the rapidly declining cost of digital signal processing and other processing functions, it is easily possible, for example, to transfer the processing for a particular function from one of the functional elements (such as the TLP) described herein to another functional",
