    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{176187=At MT there is a Blue horseshoe that has a penny under it form 1911 which was the year MTSU was founded this is located in Walnut Grove. There is also a building called the KOM its located on the northwest side of MT it was the first learning building built at MTSU., 22802=The academics are some of the best in the country seeing as we're ranked #47 in public colleges for 2010-2011. I feel that there is so much offered that is free here, but cost at other colleges. Free printing and other services on campus, who could not love that?, 951390=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 28354=It's a wonderful school for music people! They have a GREAT music program! If I may say so, it's the best in the state of Tennessee! The Honors Program is great! It has wonderful professors and a great building (although it's kind of far from the center of campus). MTSU started off as a teacher college. The new education building is having the finishing touches put on it as we speak. There should also be a new parking garage in a few years and by the end of the fall 2011 semester (I think) the new Student Union will be finished! So students looking for the old and the new both encompasses in a campus should look no further than MTSU!, 583348=If you are a young adult looking for a good education, you may find it here! Be sure to have your ducks in a row math wise, since they seem to keep students in a never ending loop of taking math 1100 semester after semester and ultimately ends in failure!, 639934=Applications are on a first come first serve basis. If you apply in January, usually you know if you have been accepted in a month or two., 512071=I attended MTSU from 2007-2009 and loved it. The campus is welcoming, beautiful, and the possibilities for involvement are endless. I am excited to be going back this coming spring to finish my degree as a non-traditional student., 139395=There is a great selection of food on this campus like Pizza Hut Chick-fil-a and an Asian place along with other favorites! MTSU is all about good for for there students there are 2 dining halls and snack machines everywhere and the new student union building with all new restaurants will be open Fall 2012., 913621=It's Murfreesboro. There is a good deal of crime here but the amount of cops here probably outnumbers the citizens in this city 2:1. Just be smart about where you're going and when/with who., 544638=1. Meet as many new people as possible! It's college you will need them! 2. I would not recommend 8 O'clock classes unless you are a morning person. 3. Remember that some science classes require a lab, which makes this a 4 credit hour class., 387698=can't say, i haven't had class yet. im an incoming freshman 2012, 766450=There is a 24/7 police force that works only for MTSU. Call 2424 and they will be there in three minutes or less. There is also a texting alert system that alerts students if there is a part of campus one should avoid, like if there was an armed robbery or bomb threat. The campus police will even walk you to and from buildings at night if you get scared.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Get involved! Being connected makes college so much more fun! Bang for the buck Tuiton for MTSU is affordable for what you get. Along with the classes, tuition allows you to have a membership to the recreation center, access to the KUC's movie theater, and so much more! Am enjoying being here I love being here. The atmosphere is appealing and the people are friendly:) Am learning a lot The college courses that I am currently enrolled in make me try my best and learn all I can in them. The professors try to actually make the classes interesting so students will want to return.
