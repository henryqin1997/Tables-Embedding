In 1999, Colorado voters approved a ballot question authorizing the use of GARVEEs to finance a system of 24 corridor projects. At the time of the public vote, one of the key arguments centered on the inflation rate for highway construction. The Colorado Department of Transportation estimated that interest rates on the GARVEEs would range from 4.0 to 5.5 percent. It was estimated that over a 10-year period, interest payments of 5.0 percent plus issuance costs would add $66 to the costs of repaying each $100 increment of bond proceeds. Proponents compared this figure favorably with the costs of inflation if future inflation rates for highway construction activity were to average approximately 8.9 percent. Opponents believed that the projected 8.9 percent inflation rate was too high and noted that lower inflation rates would not only erase any cost advantage associated with the pay-as-you-use financing strategy but indeed render it a more costly option. Actual interest rates on the Colorado GARVEEs issued to date range from 4.61 percent to 5.81 percent, and state DOT officials expect that with sustained inflation rates this debt will produce net savings. However, in Colorado as everywhere else, the capacity of debt financing to lower net costs on projects originally intended to be funded on a pay-as-you-go basis is highly dependent on economic variables that are both hard to predict and far beyond decision-makers' control., 189399=The Florida SIB has been quite active since inception. As of October 2000, $158 million has been capitalized (including interest earnings) in the combined SIB ($107 million in the Federally funded SIB, $51 million in the state-funded). Planned additional capitalization through 2010 will bring the SIB up to $542 million ($288 million in the Federally funded SIB, $254 million in the state-funded SIB)., 156156=To resolve the cash flow deficit and maintain the project schedule, RIDOT is proposing the use of several innovative finance techniques. It is anticipated that the project will employ Section 1044 toll credits in combination with advance construction and GARVEE bonds., 26952=While ISTEA, Executive Order 12893, the TE-045 initiative, the NHS Act, and TEA-21 are generally recognized as the major administrative and legislative milestones in the evolution of Federal innovations in financing strategies, one of the most important - yet least recognized - aspects of the innovative finance effort has been the ongoing Federal effort to provide a forum for discussion about new financing mechanisms and an incubator for their development. Through new publications, conference sponsorships, and myriad roundtable discussions, the Federal efforts have sought to solicit new concepts, disseminate information on how recent innovations can be applied to real-world financing dilemmas, and help project sponsors and other participants in the transportation financing community accurately assess the risks and opportunities central to use of the resulting financing strategies., 199300=The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) - one of 10 state transportation departments authorized under the initial State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) pilot program - has operated a SIB since 1996. Missouri's SIB is a non-profit entity, designated as the Missouri Transportation Finance Corporation (MTFC). TEA-21 gave Missouri the opportunity (along with California, Florida, and Rhode Island) to expand its SIB program by using Federal transportation funds authorized for fiscal years 1998 through 2003. MTFC's goal is to accelerate project completion through low-cost loans, thereby adding priority local transportation projects to the state's transportation system., 169854=The Southeast Corridor is a joint project between the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD). The project is the largest surface transportation project undertaken to date in the State of Colorado. State officials chose a unique contracting approach for the project, employing a single design-build contract for both transit and highway components. The highway improvements consist of reconstructing and widening 14 miles of I-25 and four miles of I-225. The light rail portion of the project is 19 miles in length, will be grade-separated and double-tracked, and will include 13 light rail stations and park-and-ride facilities. The multimodal project is expected to cost approximately $1.67 billion and be completed in five years, with a planned substantial completion date in 2008., 46370=Leverage of the Federal contribution has traditionally been expressed as a ratio between: 1) the total capital investment for a given project or program of projects, and 2) the Federal grant contribution for this same project or projects. Under this approach, the standard leverage of the Federal investment in conventional Federal-aid highway projects is shown as the ratio of 1.25 to 1. This ratio reflects the relationship between the standard Federal and non-Federal matching shares of 80 percent and 20 percent, respectively.[3] When applying this approach to innovative finance projects, one tends to obtain very high leveraging ratios, especially given the large number of innovative finance projects that employ bond financing. Using this approach, the TE-045 evaluation published in 1996 reported a program-wide leveraging ratio of 1.9 to 1. This figure represented the ratio between the cumulative project cost of $4.26 billion and the cumulative Federal grant contribution of $2.27 billion., 159243=In combination with the Section 1044 toll credits, RIDOT plans to employ advance construction and GARVEE bonds to finance the relocation of I-195. Use of these two innovative finance tools is described below., 11262=The emergence of innovative financing approaches over the last decade has complemented a gradual national shift towards a more broad-based and diverse highway funding environment. Table 1.2 illustrates the change in the Federal role by depicting Federal aid to highway capital projects as a percentage of total funding over the last four decades. In 1960, state and local agencies made total capital outlays of $6.1 billion on highways, and received $2.9 billion in revenue transfers (grants) from the Federal government. Thus, Federal revenues represented approximately 48.4 percent of capital outlays in 1960. By the year 2000, capital outlays by state and local agencies had increased to an estimated $62 billion. While Federal revenues provided to states also increased substantially, to $24 billion, the percentage of total funding had declined to under 40 percent. [1], 171211=Given the Southeast Corridor's estimated $1.67 billion cost and the short timeframe desired for project completion, Colorado faced a substantial financing challenge. The level of funding available to the project under a pay-as-you-go approach would not have been sufficient to provide needed funding for the project or resolve the congestion and safety concerns within a satisfactory timeframe. CDOT would have had to dedicate almost 40 percent of its annual $300 million in Federal apportionments over seven years to fund the highway portion ($795 million) of the project under a pay-as-you-go approach. As an alternative to pay-as-you-go funding, CDOT obtained voter approval for the issuance of GARVEE bonds in November 1999., 16010=Source: Federal Highway Administration, Highway Conditions and Performance Report, 1999., 272221=Federal Highway Administration.

The inventory records the available information on the four innovative finance categories, i.e., TE-045, GARVEEs, Federal credit, and state-based credit, as well as relevant information on the capitalization of the SIBs and the GARVEE bonds issued. These tools are defined in the glossary and in the FHWA Innovative Finance Primer (Publication Number FHWA-AD-02-004)., 209250=Cost estimates for the project were revised in January 2001 (see Table 4.10 for a summary of the updated financial plan). While the exact plan for meeting the increased costs has not been determined, NTTA states that it has since built up some cash reserves and now also has the borrowing capacity to cover the increased construction costs., 214235=The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) - which was authorized in Sections 1501-1504 of TEA-21 and codified in Sections 181-189 of Title 23 U.S.C. - authorizes the U.S. DOT to provide direct (secured) loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit to public and private sponsors of eligible transportation projects., 266863=Transportation Research Board, Transportation Finance for the 21st Century, Proceedings of a Conference, Dallas, Texas, April 23-25, 1997, 1997., 93495=When considering the leverage ratio attributable to Federal credit instruments, it is also possible to compare the budgetary cost of the credit instruments themselves (i.e., the cumulative subsidy cost for all loans, lines of credit, and loan guarantees awarded to date) to the total cost of the projects they support. By this analysis, the leveraging ratio achieved by the TIFIA Federal credit program and its three predecessor projects is 62:1, reflecting the comparison of a total investment of $17.784 billion to the combined Federal budgetary cost of $289 million that has been charged to the Federal credit instruments assisting those projects. The comparison of total Federal investment (rather than simply the subsidy cost of the credit instrument) to total project cost gives the most accurate view of the ultimate leveraging effect of the credit instrument., 241580=Finally, SIBs are geared to creating a new borrowing opportunity for projects that for reasons of scale or scope are not well suited to bond financing or to direct Federal credit. The volume of loans made as of the end of fiscal year 2001 approached $3 billion. Many of these loans have turned around quickly, however, suggesting that in some states, the program is functioning at least as much as a cash flow regulator as a debt financing strategy. Also, with about 70 percent of the loan activity concentrated in just four states, some of the less active states have held back on SIB implementation due to concerns about diverting Federal-aid apportionments from project grants to capitalization grants, and a lack of authority to use TEA-21 funds to capitalize. Still, those states that have committed to active SIB programs have valued the flexibility to use these funds for capitalization as well as for outright grants., 268490=Federal Highway Administration. Guidance on Section 308: Advance Construction of Federal-aid Projects, May 1996. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/sc308510.htm, 83660=The above figures reflect the plans of finance for the specified projects, meaning that they do not necessarily equal the amounts actually committed to date. (For example, as of summer 2001, Arkansas had issued only $175 million of its total planned GARVEE issuance of $575 million.) Showing the full planned (rather than actual) amount of GARVEE financing is necessary to ensure that the comparison between full project cost and the portion that will ultimately be Federally-funded yields the correct leveraging ratio., 148937=The Isaac's Canyon Interchange was built through a partnership of the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) and the technology firm. The total project cost was $10.5 million (1998 dollars). The interchange was dedicated in December 1997., 188632=The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) - one of 10 state transportation departments authorized under the initial State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) pilot program - has operated a SIB since 1996. TEA-21 gave Florida (along with California, Missouri, and Rhode Island) the opportunity to expand its SIB program by using Federal transportation funds authorized for fiscal years 1998 through 2003., 266331=Federal Highway Administration. Innovative Finance Newsletter (October 1996 - June 1997) and Innovative Finance Quarterly (September 1997 - present). www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/ifpubs.htm, 225985=Due to the high cost of the SR 125 South project, Caltrans lacked the financial resources to complete the project in a timely manner. In addition, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) has identified a $12 billion shortfall in transportation funding over the 20-year period from 1999 to 2020, assuming that San Diego's one-half-cent transportation sales tax is not extended when it expires in 2008. As a result of these funding shortfalls, without private financing and TIFIA credit support, project completion would have been delayed an estimated 15 years., 57211=The tool that shows the highest leveraging potential is the TIFIA credit program. By statute, the credit assistance available under TIFIA is limited to 33 percent of total eligible project costs. Therefore, no TIFIA project can have a leveraging ratio of less than 1:3.03 (based on the TIFIA assistance alone; TIFIA projects with other Federal contributions may have a lower leveraging ratio, based on the other Federal funds involved in the project. Since TIFIA credit assistance is \"scored\" with a budgetary amount representing the risk of nonpayment, the actual leverage ratio is much higher. As of 2002, the weighted average subsidy rate for TIFIA projects was 5.30 percent. Thus, TIFIA leveraging ratios would be expected to average 56.60:1 (depending on the amount of other Federal funds contributed to the project)., 179416=To finance the reconstruction and expansion of NM 44, the state determined that GARVEE debt would be feasible and that such debt would not count against the state's statutory debt ceiling. The New Mexico Finance Authority issued approximately $102 million of GARVEE bonds in September 1998. Average annual debt service is approximately $9.5 million and the bonds will reach maturity in 18 years. The GARVEE debt received credit ratings of Aaa (Moody's) and AAA (Standard & Poors) - made possible by bond insurance., 266545=Federal Highway Administration. An Evaluation of the TE-045 Innovative Finance Research Initiative, October 1996. www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/, 200799=Table 4.9 Summary of MTFC Projects - as of May 2001 (Dollars in Millions), 268704=Federal Highway Administration. \"Memorandum: Tapered Match on Federal-aid Projects.\" July 1999. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/legsregs/directives/policy/tapered20091229.htm, 270657=Federal Highway Administration. FHWA Guidance for Administering the State Infrastructure Bank Pilot Program. October 1997. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/guidance.htm, 233352=The capacity of innovative finance tools to produce the benefits shown in Table 5.1 lies principally in their ability to help states - or other project sponsors - surmount various financial hurdles that could otherwise lead to project delays or limit access to capital. Since 1994, sponsors have employed innovative finance strategies to help advance hundreds of highway projects. How were these advances achieved, and could these tools be further improved? To answer this question, it is helpful to examine how successfully the tools helped project sponsors overcome the impediments that these financial strategies were originally intended to address., 173656=In May 2000 and April 2001, CDOT sold $536 million and $539 million of GARVEE bonds, respectively. A portion of these funds will be used for improvements to the I-25 Southeast Corridor. The 15-year bonds, which received ratings of Aa3/AA/AA from the three rating agencies, are to be repaid with future Federal funds, sales and use tax matching funds, bond proceeds, and interest earnings. These bonds represent CDOT's first two GARVEE issues of a planned $1.7 billion program for high-priority projects financed in whole or in part by Federal funds. Per legislative mandate, CDOT's annual GARVEE debt service may not exceed 50 percent of CDOT's aggregate Federal transportation dollars reimbursed in the prior state fiscal year., 284986=TE045 Innovative Finance Initiative - A research program begun by FHWA in 1994 in response to Executive Order 12893. This finance initiative is designed to increase investment, accelerate projects, promote the use of existing innovative finance provisions, and establish the basis for future initiatives by waiving selected Federal policies and procedures, thus allowing specific transportation projects to be advanced through the use of nontraditional finance mechanisms., 267020=Federal Transit Administration. \"Innovative Finance Handbook.\" May 1996. www.fta.dot.gov/library/ntl/budet.html, 269204=Federal Highway Administration.

May 1996. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/sc313510.htm, 138418=The four TE-045 case studies represent projects or programs of projects that have utilized advance construction (California), flexible match (Isaac's Canyon in Boise, Idaho), tapered match (Magnolia Road/Interstate 135 interchange in Salina, Kansas), and Section 1044 toll credits (Rhode Island's Interstate 195 relocation). Unlike the other TE-045 case studies, which represent projects either already completed or underway, the Rhode Island case study represents prospective use of an innovative finance tool. These case studies illustrate the flexibility and leverage afforded by Federal funds management tools developed through the TE-045 initiative., 203741=The Bi-State Development Agency is receiving an $11 million direct loan from MTFC to finance the local match required to receive Federal Transit Administration grants. The loan was made in three disbursements of $5.2 million, $5.5 million, and $0.4 million in June 2000, June 2001, and October 2001, respectively. Each loan disbursement has a term of 10 years and interest rates ranging from 4.64 percent to 5.49 percent., 23167=The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) laid the ground-work for innovative finance through the introduction of several new concepts designed to increase transportation investment. These included the Section 1012 loan program (later codified as Section 129 of Title 23 of the U.S. Code), which allowed states to use regular Federal-aid apportionments to fund direct loans to projects with dedicated revenue streams; opportunities to levy tolls on Federally-supported highways; and permitting certain toll revenue expenditures to serve as a credit against non-Federal matching requirements., 223789=The State Route 125 South project will consist of 11.5 miles of new highway in San Diego County, California, from SR 905 near the United States-Mexico border to State Route 54 near Sweetwater Reservoir. SR 125 South will open as a four-lane limited access highway. The project includes a two-mile non-tolled segment known as the San Miguel Connector and a 9.5-mile toll road with electronic toll collection. Construction of SR 125 South is estimated to cost $417 million (October 2001). The project was initiated in 1991 with the signing of a franchise agreement, and design and construction are expected to begin in 2002. The toll road portion is anticipated to open by 2005. Further, expansion of SR 125, which could include a six- to eight-lane highway, carpool lanes, and/or transit facilities in the median, may be pursued if it is determined that it would increase equity returns of the private developer., 24382=This initiative was launched with the introduction of an experimental \"Test and Evaluation\" program, designated as TE-045, to solicit ideas from the states on a range of new financial strategies designed to stretch limited transportation dollars and enhance the flexibility of Federal-aid highway funds. The TE-045 initiative has generated substantial benefits in terms of building more projects with fewer Federal dollars and accelerating project construction. Many of the innovations tested were subsequently approved for general use through administration action or legislative changes made under the National Highway System Designation (NHS) Act of 1995 and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21)., 187426=As of September 2001, 32 states have entered into 250 SIB loan agreements with a dollar value over $2.8 billion.[13] The Florida and Missouri SIBs are highlighted below., 33125=Table 2.1 summarizes information contained in the project inventory by innovative finance category. While a larger number of projects are contained in the database for the TE-045 category, only 62 of the 101 TE-045 projects approved since 1994 were analyzed in this report. The 39 excluded projects fall in the following categories:, 36944=Notes: Section 129 project counts and costs include the George Bush Turnpike, which also utilized partial conversion of advance construction as part of its project financing plan. Certain TE-045 tools, such as partial conversion of advance construction and Section 1044 toll credits, became codified into the regular Federal-aid program, and no longer require special approval. These projects are difficult to distinguish from standard Federal-aid projects. Thus, only the projects that were advanced under TE-045 were counted as part of this analysis. If the additional projects were counted, it would probably increase the quantitative results., 170703=The Southeast Corridor, one of Colorado's highest priority travel corridors, will link the two largest employment centers in the Denver region - the Southeast Business District and the Central Business District. In 1992, the Denver Regional Council of Governments conducted a study of the Corridor and determined that traffic control tools alone were not sufficient to alleviate the congestion and that capital improvements were needed., 159920=GARVEE bonds would assist RIDOT in maintaining the desired construction schedule despite the cash flow constraints in years 2006 to 2011. There are numerous ways to structure a GARVEE bond issue for this project. At this point, the most feasible option is the issuance of $250 million of bonds in 2005 with a 10-year repayment schedule beginning in 2006. This scenario would decrease the annual Federal authorization requirement for 2006 through 2012 by $16 million. It would, however, extend the payments out four additional years. By issuing $250 million in GARVEE bonds prior to 2006, the state would be in a position to actually accelerate construction where technically feasible. This could result in savings due to avoidance of construction-related inflation., 95292=Experience since 1994 shows that innovative finance strategies can expand investment in at least three ways:, 290851=[13] This information presented as of September 2001 reflect data collected by the U.S. DOT on SIB loan agreements as of the end of Federal fiscal year 2001. Data used for purposes of analysis presented in this report are current as of spring 2001, and differ somewhat from the more current September 2001 data., 141204=Table 4.1 State of California Advance Construction Balance - 1995 Through 2000 (Dollars in Millions), 269370=Federal Highway Administration. \"Guidance on Section 322: Third Party Donations of Funds, Materials, or Services for Federally Assisted Projects.\" May 1996. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/sc322510.htm, 23798=In 1994, Executive Order 12893 established more cost-effective infrastructure investment as a priority for all Federal agencies. The Executive Order prompted more systematic analysis of the costs and benefits of proposed infrastructure investments; efficient management of infrastructure; encouragement of private sector participation in infrastructure investment; and encouragement of more effective state and local programs. In response to that Executive Order, U.S. DOT and FHWA undertook a major initiative in 1994 to promote and facilitate infrastructure investment., 190234=Table 4.7 Summary of Florida SIB Projects - as of October 2000 (Dollars in Millions), 268893=Inman, Max. \"Grant Management Techniques: Tapered Match May Provide a Better Fit.\" Innovative Finance Quarterly (Summer/Fall 1999). http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/ifq52.htm, or http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/ifq52.pdf (pdf version), 144793=TEA-21 granted the State of California a $10.5 million High-Priority Project to build a freeway extension on Route 41 crossing Madera and Fresno counties. In July 1999, the local agencies responsible for constructing this project were ready to advertise the project. At that time, however, because of the spend-out provisions for HPP projects, only $4.6 million of the $10.5 million in HPP funds were available. The total $10.5 million would not be available until October 2002, resulting in a potential project delay of three years., 6445=Thanks are also extended to Miriam Roskin, Roskin Consulting, whose previous evaluation of the TE-045 innovative finance initiative was especially helpful in developing the approach to and conclusions of this performance review; Tamar Henkin and Karin DeMoors, TransTech Management, Inc., for the preparation of the case studies; and Patrick Balducci, for contributions in the early phases of this effort., 290010=[11] Project costs are assumed to be in 1998 dollars, the base year of the IMPLAN model. Project cost collections from government sources occurred from 1996 to 2001. Since these cost estimates do not capture the likely increases in costs associated with transportation construction inflation, the economic impacts are likely to be conservative estimates., 215956=Tren Urbano - a venture of the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) - is a 17-kilometer rapid rail line that will serve Metropolitan San Juan and be closely integrated with the local bus system. The system, estimated to cost $1.68 billion, is scheduled to be completed by June 2004., 145339=Using advance construction, however, Caltrans was able to authorize work as soon as the project was ready to be advertised. Caltrans obligated the available HPP funds ($4.6 million) and authorized the difference ($5.9 million) using advance construction procedures. Each October, when another allocation of HPP funds is made, Caltrans converts the appropriate amount from advance construction balances and is reimbursed for expenditures of state funds with Federal dollars., 31930=The project information was compiled from readily available data sources, including Federal data collection and reporting systems and through direct contact with the states. Data were collected through the spring of 2001, and represent information current as of that time. Since that time, of course, additional projects have been advanced using innovative finance techniques. For example, a new TIFIA project has now been approved, and the volume of SIB activity has approached $3 billion. While these additional innovative finance projects are not captured in the inventory and performance review, it follows that even greater benefits would be revealed from the larger universe of projects., 25869=The inclusion in the NHS Act of provisions to reimburse states for eligible debt-related costs and added flexibility related to advance construction gave rise to the new mechanism referred to as Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles (GARVEEs), sometimes referred to as Grant Anticipation Notes or GANs. Further expanding advance construction flexibility, a July 15, 1995 Federal Register notice implemented partial conversion of advance construction, which allowed states to convert an advance constructed project to a Federal-aid project in stages rather than all at once., 272391=U.S. Department of Transportation. TEA-21, Value Pricing Pilot Program Fact Sheet. September 1998. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/tea21/factsheets/valpr.htm, 180762=In 1998, subsequent to the decision to issue GARVEE debt, the New Mexico Legislature also granted the State Highway Commission authority to issue bonds for 17 corridors throughout the state. The bonds authorized by the Legislature are commonly known as CHAT (Citizens Highway Advisory Task Force) bonds. The State Highway Commission has issued four CHAT bond series beginning in October 1998, with $214 million of the proceeds and a portion of the interest and bond premium budgeted for NM 44. The CHAT bonds are being retired with FHWA funds on a reimbursement basis. FHWA has allowed the excess state match credited to the GARVEE bonds to be applied to the CHAT bonds., 5364=prepared by Cambridge Systematics, Inc. 150 Cambridge Park Drive, Suite 4000 Cambridge, Massachusetts 02140, 5601=July 2002, 261273=A detailed inventory has been compiled of projects that have been advanced under one or more of the U.S. DOT innovative finance initiatives since 1994. The inventory records the available information on the four categories of innovative finance tools, i.e., TE-045, GARVEEs, Federal credit, and state-based credit, as well as relevant information on the capitalization of the SIBs and the GARVEE bonds issued. The inventory was compiled from readily available data sources, including Federal data collection and reporting systems and through direct contact with the states. Data were collected through the spring of 2001, and represent information current as of that time., 177297=The New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department (NMSHTD) reconstructed and expanded 123 miles of State Route 44 (NM 44) from two lanes into four lanes. The total estimated project cost was $364 million and the project was completed in November 2001., 52416=Table 2.4 compares the leveraging benefits that would be expected from the different categories of innovative finance, under this theoretical approach. The comparison is achieved by considering a hypothetical bridge project with a total eligible cost of $300 million. Under the traditional Federal-aid program, Federal-aid funds would provide $240 million of the cost, and the state would contribute a non-Federal share of $60 million. For this scenario, the leveraging ratio would be 1.25:1, or each Federal dollar would buy $1.25 worth of capital project., 270102=Federal Highway Administration.

May 1996. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/ifg.htm, 154828=The proposed financing plan for the relocation of I-195 calls for the allocation of $20 million in FY 1999, $30 million in each of FY 2000 and FY 2001, and an average of $33.8 million per year in FY 2002 through FY 2012 for a total of $452 million (includes a $5 million reserve over estimated project costs of $447 million). While these allocations will provide sufficient levels of Federal and matching funding to complete the project, there will be short-term cash flow shortages during the peak of construction. The cash flow problems are due, in large part, to the issuance of three major contracts for the project during 2003 and 2004. The anticipated cash deficit is shown in Figure 4.1., 269882=Federal Highway Administration. GARVEE Bond Guidance. August 2000. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/garguid1.htm, 97272=State officials interviewed for the original TE-045 evaluation in 1996 reported that the availability of the flexible match opportunity clearly influenced the states' ability to undertake these projects. While it is doubtful that any state would turn down an offer of private funding simply for lack of the opportunity to substitute that contribution for the state match, the opportunity to use private contributions as a substitute for public matching funds creates an extra incentive to actively pursue these partnerships. This is especially true in cases where a state faces an extreme shortage of matching funds and would be obliged to defer or forgo the entire project - and the private contribution - in the absence of the flexible match opportunity., 200572=As shown in Table 4.9, MTFC had signed 10 loan agreements, totaling just over $69 million, as of May 2001, facilitating a system wide investment of $281 million. Loan disbursements as of that date were $45 million., 163480=The final project cost was $6.7 million. Construction began in April 1996 and was completed in June 1998., 270502=Federal Highway Administration. State Infrastructure Bank Primer. September 1997. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/sibprimr.htm, 104170=1 The volume of loans represented in the SIB project inventory totals $761 million, with actual disbursements as of early 2001 totaling $460 million. The repayment sources identified by the states indicate that approximately 20 percent of SIB loan repayments are expected to derive from new and/or specially dedicated revenue streams such as tolls, tax increment financing, special fees, and private payments. The remaining 80 percent would be paid from existing general taxes (such as sales or property taxes) or from existing transportation funding sources (such as existing fuel or motor vehicle registration taxes). While it is expected that the entire $761 million in committed loans will eventually be recycled back into the banks once they are repaid, 20 percent of this total - or $160 million - is expected to derive from new user fees or other project-based revenue streams., 226622=To attract private capital to highway projects and build roads faster, California passed legislation in 1989 that allowed the state to enter into partnerships with private firms for the development of privately financed transportation projects. SR 125 South is one of four demonstration projects approved under the legislation., 72252=The dollar value of Federally-assisted innovative finance projects undertaken as of spring 2001 totals over $29 billion, of which $8.6 billion has been funded with Federal-aid grant funding. The remainder has come from other sources, the most significant of which has been bond proceeds. The level of co-investment reveals the extent to which the purchasing power of limited Federal grant funds has been extended by virtue of: (a) new mechanisms to attract other sources of funds to transportation investment, and (b) the Federal government's increased openness towards participation in projects that demand a high level of coordination with other funding partners - and not only the states, FHWA's traditional financial partner. At the same time, innovative finance has played a more subtle role by bringing brand new resources to the table, not only expanding the purchasing power of the Federal dollar but that of all public funds devoted to highway infrastructure investment., 189044=In addition to its Federally authorized and funded SIB, in June 2000, FDOT created a separate state-funded SIB, capitalized with $150 million in state funds ($50 million per year over three years). FDOT has developed a single application process and program guide-lines for the state-funded and Federally funded components of its SIB program., 287329=[1] Since capital outlays and revenue transfers do not necessarily occur in the same calendar year for individual projects, these percentages are not exact but are reasonably good indicators of the relative share of Federal, state, and local funding.

The key inputs to the leverage calculation are shown in bold print. The leveraging ratio is calculated by dividing total project costs ($3.313 billion) by the sum of the Federal contributions toward these projects ($2.238 billion). The Federal contributions comprise any grant funding made available through the standard Federal-aid Highway Program as well as the Federal share of GARVEE bond proceeds. This Federal share reflects the projected share of total debt service that the issuer will pay using future Federal-aid apportionments. The across-the-board leveraging ratio for these projects is 1.48 to 1, slightly over the standard Federal leveraging ratio of 1.25 to 1., 79333=The leveraging ratio shown in Table 3.1 for TE-045 projects was derived by summing project costs and then dividing this figure by Federal grant contributions. This calculation was performed for 62 of the 101 TE-045 projects approved since 1994. As described previously in Section 1.1, the 39 excluded projects fall in the following categories:, 202660=The Bi-State Development Agency of the Missouri-Illinois Metropolitan District operates the St. Louis area's network of light rail, bus, and paratransit van transportation. Bi-State has a fleet of 600 buses, 41 light rail vehicles, and 63 Call-A-Ride paratransit vans. The fiscal year 2001 operating budget for the Bi-State Transit System is $145 million and its capital budget totals $455 million. Bi-State carried over 52 million passengers on MetroLink buses and Call-A-Ride vans during fiscal year 2000., 267160=Federal Transit Administration. \"Innovative Finance Techniques for America's Transit Systems.\" September 1998. www.fta.dot.gov/library/ntl/budet.html, 137539=In 1994, the U.S. DOT and FHWA undertook a major initiative to promote and facilitate infrastructure investment. This initiative was launched with the introduction of an experimental \"Test and Evaluation\" program, designated as TE-045, to test and evaluate a range of new financial strategies designed to stretch limited transportation dollars and enhance the flexibility of Federal-aid highway funds. The TE-045 initiative has generated substantial benefits in terms of building more projects with fewer Federal dollars and accelerating project construction. Many of the innovations tested have been codified by the National Highway System Designation (NHS) Act of 1995 and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). To date, this program has supported over 100 projects in 41 states with a total construction value of nearly $7 billion., 189814=As shown in Table 4.7, as of October 2000, the combined Florida SIB had approved 29 loans totaling $424 million, leveraging nearly $2.8 billion in total project investment. The SIB has been able to approve this significant amount of loans with the existing $158 million in capitalization via a combination of funds recycling on short-term loans and the ability to commit planned future capitalization funds., 148044=California Department of Transportation. Correspondence with Dick Petrie. May, June, and July 2001., 229344=Note: Estimates as of date of term sheet July 2000., 192776=The SIB loan is being used specifically for design and construction of the MIC Core Initial Phase. The MIC Core will be the intermodal transfer hub of the entire project. It is anticipated that construction of the MIC Core will take five years and be completed in 2005., 154614=As of July 2001, the relocation of I-195 is anticipated to cost $447 million. The project began in 1999 and is planned to be complete in 2012., 20412=Table 1.4 aligns these goals to the new tools that have been developed. Eight years after the beginning of this effort in 1994, this report reviews how well the program has met the above goals, and whether additional changes to the tools created could bring even greater results. The report also seeks to identify any areas where the Federal effort has been less successful, in order to provide a guide to direct future investment and policy discussions., 56755=Under the report's methodology, the SIB itself is considered the project, not the individual projects to which it provides assistance, and loan repayments made to date are added to the total capitalization. This level of analysis avoids the limitation identified above. If the bridge were to be financed with a GARVEE bond, again, the Federal and state ratio would probably not vary, and the leveraging ratio would still work out to be 1.25:1., 206543=A joint effort of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA, formerly Texas Turnpike Authority), the project consists of five major segments and has been under construction since 1996. As of December 2000, 45 percent of the Turnpike was complete. Construction of the Turnpike is expected to be substantially complete in July 2004 and fully complete by December 2006. The total estimate of project costs for all five segments is $941 million., 26462=TEA-21 was passed in 1998, enacting the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) to provide up to $10.6 billion in credit assistance to major projects of national significance. While TIFIA is the major finance innovation provided under TEA-21, the legislation also continued the SIB pilot program, although limiting Federal capitalization opportunities to only four states, and provided additional flexibility in non-Federal matching share requirements., 56049=If the bridge were to be financed with a Section 129 or SIB loan, the state would have to either capitalize a SIB with sufficient state funding (and applicable match) to provide the loan, or directly fund the loan out of their Federal-aid program. In most cases, states have used Federal-aid funding to capitalize SIBs and Section 129 loans. Under these scenarios, the traditional leverage calculation would not show anything different from the standard 1.25:1. In particular, it would not show the benefit of having loan repayments available for future projects. As noted above, in this report, the analysis is done not at the project level, but at the level of the State Infrastructure Bank., 286158=Toll Credits - Section 1044 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act permitted states to apply the value of certain highway expenditures funded with toll revenues toward the required state match on current Federal aid projects. States may only substitute toll credits for state match if they demonstrate a \"maintenance of effort\" (MOE). The MOE test requires that a state's prior year highway spending equaled or exceeded the average of the previous three years' expenditures., 140764=Caltrans funds approximately 50 percent of its annual Federal-aid formula funds via the advance construction technique - predominantly for construction, right-of-way acquisition, and preliminary engineering efforts. The Department's goal is to limit use of this technique, however, to no more than one year of Federal funding. Table 4.1 displays Caltrans' use of advance construction for Federal fiscal years 1995 through 2000., 269638=Federal Highway Administration. \"Memorandum: Toll Credit for Non-Federal Share, Section 1111(c) of TEA-21, Implementing Guidance.\" August 1998. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/tea21/tollcred.htm, 268280=Federal Highway Administration, Federal-Aid Policy Guide, Subpart G - Advance Construction of Federal-Aid Projects, May 25, 2000. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/legsregs/directives/fapg/cfr0630g.htm, 192483=The capital cost of the MIC is estimated to be $1.35 billion (in 1999 dollars). Construction of the various components of the MIC will be phased over a 12- to 15-year span based on current projections of patronage demand, the need for increased capacity, and funding availability., 259442=The enthusiastic response to the innovative finance test and evaluation research program established in 1994 demonstrated states' significant need for greater flexibility in the Federal-aid highway program; the subsequent implementation of the strategies identified during this effort has demonstrated the capacity to build greater flexibility into the program at minimal cost. The accomplishments in project acceleration and leverage of existing funding sources clearly show the sizeable returns generated through a near decade of Federal commitment to financial innovation, with a relatively small Federal outlay., 242590=The range of tools that states and other project sponsors have tested since 1994 can significantly expand the nation's transportation financing capacity. Yet not all tools will be suited to every project, or can be applied in every state or local area. In addition, in order to apply these tools, states may need to develop administrative capabilities and policies to manage them. As formerly innovative practices become more fully integrated into the standard Federal-aid program, some of the major administrative and policy steps will include:, 98041=The 16 flexible match projects receiving the $48 million in private contributions represent only those projects that advanced under the TE-045 research project. Flexible match gained approval as a standard Federal-aid practice with enactment of the NHS Act in 1995, it can reasonably be assumed that these 16 projects represent but a fraction of the total number of projects ultimately using private contributions to satisfy non-Federal matching requirements.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Table 1.1 Summary of Quantifiable Results: Evaluation of Innovative Finance Nearly a decade later, at least $29.1 billion in innovative finance projects have been advanced, which were supported by $8.6 billion in Federal-aid funding. On average, for each Federal dollar invested in an innovative finance project, $3.40 of construction investment has been enabled, which compares quite favorably to the ratio of $1.25 to $1.00 for every dollar invested in the traditional grant program. This \"leveraging ratio\" is an important indicator of the effectiveness of Federal-aid funding. Simply put, greater leveraging means that each dollar invested has gone further - building more projects for the same amount of Federal-aid funding. Table 1.1 summarizes the leveraging and other quantitative results of this evaluation, which are explained in detail in the rest of this report. In the early 1990s, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), recognizing the need to expand investment in the nation's transportation infrastructure, launched a comprehensive initiative to create new funding tools and expand flexibility of the Federal-aid highway funding program. This \"innovative finance\" initiative was an attempt to meet the increasing gap between transportation capital needs and available resources, without direct increases in Federal grant funding. The initiative also responded to states' calls for greater flexibility in the use of their Federal-aid funds. 1.1 Results in Brief 1.0 Executive Summary Thanks are also extended to Miriam Roskin, Roskin Consulting, whose previous evaluation of the TE-045 innovative finance initiative was especially helpful in developing the approach to",
    "textAfterTable": "Economic Impacts Total employment impacts of $827 million (thousands of job years) Total output impacts of $91 billion Total labor income impacts of $30 billion While these quantitative results are impressive, they represent only a part of the benefits achieved by innovative finance. Many of these benefits are difficult to measure quantitatively. For example, many of the government officials interviewed for this research cited project acceleration as a key advantage of innovative financing techniques. Yet data on project acceleration was not readily available for many projects. Thus, this report quantifies benefits where feasible, and illustrates, through detailed analysis of specific projects, the benefits that are more difficult to measure on a macro level, but have wide-ranging effects across state surface transportation programs. This analysis provides the first comprehensive evaluation of U.S. DOT's innovative finance program since its inception. The results in this report should help guide both Federal policy makers, as they continue to improve and enhance Federal surface transportation programs, and state and local officials, as they continue to make use of these programs to advance critical transportation projects. 1.2 Background: The Federal Role in Highway Finance \"Innovative finance\" for transportation is a broadly defined term that encompasses a combination of specially designed techniques that supplement traditional highway financing methods. While many of these techniques may not be new to other sectors, their application to transportation is innovative. The emergence of innovative financing approaches over the last decade has complemented a",
