By winning the first set against Robredo, Federer did however establish a new outright record for consecutive sets won in Grand Slams in the Open Era, having won 36 in a row stretching back to the third set of the 2006 US Open final.

He is today bidding to equal his longest streak of wins in Grand Slams, which he set from 2005 Wimbledon through the 2006 Roland Garros semifinals. Overall, that streak of 27 straight matches put Federer in second place for the longest Grand Slam winning streak in the Open Era, behind Rod Laver.

This is a record for consecutive weeks at No. 1 \u0096 he overtook Jimmy Connors\u0092 mark of 160 straight weeks on 26th February.
