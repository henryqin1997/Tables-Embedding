It is so diverse and there is always something for everybody! Tips for prospective students College is a great experience... just do not forget why you are here. Reading in your textbooks is a major bonus. Also, utilize your teacher/professor's office hours. (: Bang for the buck It is definitely a bang for your buck. You get access to everything: activity center, student success center, tutors, etc. Am enjoying being here I no longer live on campus but I still enjoy being on campus as much as I did when I was living on campus. Campus life is always buzzing.",
