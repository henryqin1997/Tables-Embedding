            "The food is pretty great for school food. It's not super healthy concerning fresh foods. I can only speak for the grill in the Griffen. The smaller cafes have wraps and sandwiches (prepared and made fresh) which is nice as well. Snacks, drinks,",
            "I stay off campus so I only know what is said about the dorms by my classmates. Some buildings are better than others. Partly because of actual building issues, partly because of the other students living in the building.",
            "The course load can be overwhelming sometimes but the work is doable if you are taking proper notes, reviewing regularly and getting clarification/tutoring in whatever you are unsure about.",
            "Take advantage of the tutors, they are a great resource!"

There are always security guards who do safety checks throughout the day, and there are safety buttons all around campus that you can press if you need help or assistance. I got to campus an hour early every day and sometimes that would be at 6:30 in the morning, and there was always a security guard around., 99544=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 13132=I absolutely love being at Ohio Dominican. What makes ODU stand out from other Universities is the small campus size. At ODU you get the best of both worlds, being in the big city of Columbus, but living on a small, private campus. The athletics at ODU have reached a new goal this year as we have been accepted into the NCAA Division II GLIAC Conference. As a member of the Women's Soccer Team this brings us many new opportunities to play at a higher level of competition and do much more traveling as a team. The athletic facilities at ODU are all very new, the football and soccer teams play on a turf field at Panther Stadium. The basketball gym was recently redone for the men's and women's basketball teams, and the baseball field is scheduled to receive maintenance soon. Along with new athletic facilities, we also built a brand new student center, The Griff, this past summer which really brings a lot more to the campus. The student center includes the bookstore, two food places, and various studios, computer rooms, and lounge areas. The latest project at ODU is Battelle Hall, a new science building that will be open and running in the Fall of 2010.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students liberals residents Tips for prospective students Check around and do your homework. It is great for residents but commuters get shorted. There is very limited parking, the panther plaza (or commuter lounge) is way too noisy to study or do anything for a commuter and they offer little food choices for non-residents. This year, they are opening a student center which might help, but still is tough. Also, the professors are very liberal so if you are looking for a more conservative campus, please look elsewhere.
