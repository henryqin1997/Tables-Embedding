Surveys were sent to 2000 randomly selected people at Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis (400 faculty, 400 staff, 400 graduate students, and 800 undergraduate students). The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). For questions asking opinions of services, the results shown include in order: the average opinion score (labeled \"Average\"), the percentage of people who were satisfied with the service (graded it as a 3 or better, labeled \"Satisfaction\"), the percentage of people who use the service (which we have taken to be the percentage of people who expressed an opinion about it, labeled \"Usage\").}",
