The amount of available CPU resources on a router is dependent upon variables such as traffic load and how other protocols are configured and run. The ability to use 1000 tracked objects is dependent upon the available CPU. Testing should be conducted on site to ensure that the service works under the specific site traffic conditions., 144629=This command was modified.
