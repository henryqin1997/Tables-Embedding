            "The School is a beautiful place. Just make sure you know that it is the right college for you. Its like high school but your more independent and free and it feels good but you have to be careful and watch yourself. Just because your free you don't have to go out and get crazy that's not what college is about. You go there to accomplish. Drinking is not an accomplishment it can be trouble so check yourself, and don't get crazy.",
            "It is a beautiful school and I can not wait to attend classes there. The dorms are amazing and the people are so nice. I'm extremely excited to start my second year. I know this school is going to be better than the last. The classes I have seen are really going to help out with my major and what I want to do in life. It is going to be a great 3 years."

The social justice principles on which the school was founded in 1945 still shine bright today through the ever increasing diverse and friendly students. Roosevelt is sure to help every student find their way to success., 3967=There are clubs and activities for everyone at Roosevelt. There are different associations for students of varying backgrounds and several sports teams. Here's a list of the student organizations that Roosevelt had in the Spring 2012 semester: http://www.roosevelt.edu/CSI/Orgs/List_of_Student_Orgs.aspx, 4486=Roosevelt University actually has a formal Homecoming dance every year! And the Auditorium building, located on Congress and Michigan Avenue, has a ton of history. It used to be a hotel, was used to house soldiers at one point, and is now a school. The library is huge and beautiful, and offers an incredible view of the lake from the top floor. The library stacks also stretch for one whole city block. There are several various theatres within the building, and the main, well-known theatre (though it has a separate entrance) taking up the first floor and resulting in the odd horseshoe shape of the halls. There are hidden stairwells and bathrooms, and the building is overall enjoyable to be in. Picture of the library: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XekJWAFcLSs/TlKbt8iHqCI/AAAAAAAABhM/cvkh6MYBs3Y/s1600/Library-overall.jpg, 8005=Many, many housing options, especially with the new building just opening for the 2012-2013 school year. All the dorms have great views of Chicago, and are conveniently located in the south loop, very near to public transportation. Most of the dorms are also shared with other schools in the area (DePaul University, Columbia College, Robert Morris University), and there are several rooming options (apartments, suites, studio apartments). Each building also has very high security, so don't be worried about the dangerous city. The south loop has cleaned up a LOT in the past 20 years.
