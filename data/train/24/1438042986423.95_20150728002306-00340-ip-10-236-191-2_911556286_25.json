As boring as it sounds study a lot if your like me then the library is the perfect environment to do so, it's nice and spacious but be careful because if you want to use the computer or find a cubicle be mindful that rush hour is at noon and ends around 1:30 pm. Try to plan your day out and at least study four an hour on each subject. When you are picking out a class make sure you pick classes that even each other out meaning that if you get a class thats hard try to get classes that are as hard as that class because some classes require a lot of work I do not recommend people to take English and a class such as philosophy because they both require a lot of writing up to you though., 52588=I have not started there but i will in the fall of 2012. The times that I've been to the campus it has been a wonderfull experience. The staff is very helpful., 84569=Get in the system EARLY. I did in March and got the first day of freshman registration, so I got every class I wanted.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The campus is well kept and the plaza, Plaza Vaquero, is green with well kept grass and trees. There are plenty of tables to sit at outside, a two floor library, and two levels to the cafeteria for people to relax with friends or study quietly. I really enjoy being able to walk across campus in about 5 minutes. My only issue with the school is that smoking is permitted so I would recommend doing your best to avoid the smoking sections of the school if you are a non-smoker. Am learning a lot Glendale Community College has some wonderful faculty. The teachers are hard working despite major cut backs at the college. No matter what, the teachers encourage you to push beyond what you normally do with your learning abilities to go outside of your comfort zone. I've learned how to communicate more effectively with fellow students as well as I've become more open to asking questions and requesting tutoring from my teachers. I'd definitely take advantage of their tutoring opportunities because they are very helpful. Login to rate or flag the reviews Ani from Glendale, CA 02/03/2012 Reviewer is",
