It is hard to believe that a manufacturer still dares to equip a laptop with such a screen today. The screens in the Latitude (247:1; 0.94 cd/m\u00b2) and ProBook (222:2; 1.023 cd/m\u00b2) do not look much better. The M30's screen cannot reproduce either the sRGB or the AdobeRGB color spaces. The coverage rates are 49% (sRGB) and 34% (AdobeRGB)., 68483=The screen's average DeltaE 2000 shift in state of delivery is 12.17. It is thus on par with the majority of screens that we have assessed. No color achieves the target range of DeltaE less than 3. The screen exhibits a clear bluish cast.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{194607=The battery lasted for 5:34 h in idle operation. The ProBook (11:12 h), and in particular the Latitude (19:05 h) achieve better runtimes. Idle mode is ascertained via Battery Eater's Reader's test. The screen is set to minimum brightness, the energy-saving profile is enabled, and the wireless modules are off. The M30 shut down after 1:26 h of load. Again, the Latitude (1:56 h) and the ProBook (2:08 h) last longer. The load runtime is tested via Battery Eater's Classic test. The screen runs in maximum brightness, and the high-performance mode and the radio modules are enabled., 99728=The HD Graphics 4400 core is responsible for video output. It supports DirectX 11.1 and clocks with speeds ranging from 200 to 1000 MHz. Since the ProBook and Latitude both sport the same GPU, the 3DMark benchmark scores from all three laptops are identical., 195442=The M30 stopped the Wi-Fi test after 3:37 h. Once again, both the ProBook (4:17 h), and especially the Latitude (14:31 h) manage better runtimes. Websites are automatically opened every 40 seconds in this test. The energy-saving profile is enabled, and the screen's brightness is set to approximately 150 cd/m\u00b2. We ascertain the video playback time by running the clip Big Buck Bunny (H.264 encoding, 1920x1080 pixels) in a loop. The energy-saving profile is enabled, the wireless modules are off, and the screen's brightness is set to approximately 150 cd/m\u00b2. The M30 lasted 4:13 h. The Latitude again proves to have a considerably longer runtime (8:59 h). We did not perform this test with the ProBook.}",

The gaming performance of such laptops will at most satisfy casual gamers. Lenovo's M30 belongs to these laptops.

    "textAfterTable": "Emissions System Noise The M30 is virtually silent when idling. The fan spins at its lowest speed, and the hard drive only clacks occasionally. The fan has to work harder when the laptop is loaded. However, it does not get unduly loud. The noise level only increases to 33.5 dB in medium load via 3DMark06 and 38.5 dB during full load in the stress test via Prime95 and Furmark. The system noises of both the Latitude and Probook are overall a bit lower. Noise Level Idle 31.2 / 31.2 / 31.2 dB(A)",
