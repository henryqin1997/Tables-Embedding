            "Haptic Enabled Gaming Peripheral for a Musical Game - A haptic enabled gaming peripheral that simulates a musical instrument includes a body, a first sensing element and a first actuator. A processor, located within the body of the gaming peripheral, communicates with a host computer running a software program corresponding to a musical game. The first sensing element, disposed within the body and coupled to the processor, senses an input from the user. The sensed input is communicated to the host processor. The first actuator, disposed within the body and coupled to the processor, outputs a haptic effect in response to receiving an activating signal based on an event that occurs in the software program. In some implementations, the first sensed element is disposed proximate to the first actuator so that the user perceives the haptic effect in response to providing the input.",

            "OVERDRIVE VOLTAGE FOR AN ACTUATOR TO GENERATE HAPTIC EFFECTS - A system in which haptic effects are generated using an actuator receives a frequency response for the actuator at a standard voltage and generates a lookup table for an overdrive voltage based on the frequency response. The system then receives a haptic signal for the haptic effect and extracts one or more frequencies for the haptic signal. The system then determines the corresponding overdrive voltage from the lookup table for each of the frequencies and, for each of the frequencies, applies the corresponding overdrive voltage to the actuator. The overdrive voltage is greater than or equal to the standard voltage.",
