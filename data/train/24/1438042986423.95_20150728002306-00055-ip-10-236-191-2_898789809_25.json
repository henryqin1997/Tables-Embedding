In Fall of 2013 there were like 30 bi-weekly beatings and robberies with guns in the parking lots of naive students who are big soft targets for cash and computers and iPhones. I was honestly surprised nobody died. I was personally escorting girls in my classes to other classes and their cars at their requests. Armed security would make many feel better. For the rest of you, be your own security (paraphrase of what the president of the school advised us to do) and watch your back. This year there hasn't been hardly as many violent crimes, yet. There are still lots of break ins and car thefts but that isn't so much the fault of the school as it is the non-students who ride the A-line bus from the north to prowl. Just a sad fact of going to school here., 211031=I've gone to Highline on and off since 2009. I've had some really good professors and some not so good. I think Highline is what you make it and a great springboard to transfer to other schools., 225641=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students ALL Tips for prospective students Ask the people around you for their opinions on teachers. Choosing what teachers you have makes all the difference in your experience in classes. Bang for the buck College is expensive.... but at Highline it is so so worth it. Am enjoying being here The teachers that I have had make the learning enjoyable. I am in the education department and they know that everyone has different ways of learning and adapt to those styles. I could have transferred to Central Washington University and finished my AA but I enjoyed being here and to keep costs down I stayed. There are so many different events on campus that gets everyone involved. Multi cultural, women's studies, MLK, Diversity and a plethora of others Am learning a lot I did running start through my high school and Highline was a great place to go. The administration was very helpful in making sure that I had me classes in order not only for my high school graduation but on track towards getting my AA.",
