    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{51411=An official wig was also shown in 2014.[13], 42154=An independent search on Nico Nico Douga revealed that most VOCALOIDs had less then 1,000 videos uploaded on Nico Nico Douga in 2011 between July 1st and December 15th. Luka, however, had managed to gain enough views not to fall into this category. Luka had the 4th highest number of uploads with 2103 videos to Nico Nico Douga. Luka, who had 3855998 views and 301640 mylists in total was the 5th most popular viewed VOCALOID on the site. Luka\u2019s 1837.94/143.78 average views placed her as the bottom of the top 6 VOCALOIDs based on average view counts. However, when the lists of top 6 VOCALOIDs were sorted based on the mean number (a more accurate reflection of the VOCALOIDs popularity) Luka did not make the top six.[23], 99863=Megurine Luka (\u5de1\u97f3\u30eb\u30ab), codenamed CV03, is a Japanese VOCALOID developed and distributed by Crypton Future Media, Inc., and was initially released in January 2009 for the VOCALOID2 engine. She is part of the Character Vocal Series and is a Character Voice VOCALOID. In March 2015, additional voice banks and an upgrade to the VOCALOID4 engine were released. She was the third release for Crypton's VOCALOID Character Vocal Series, and her vocals are described as \"cool, somewhat mysterious\".[1], 50684=Crypton Future Media VOCALOIDs have also appeared in 2013 calendars.[15][16], 44562=In March 2015, the Megurine Luka V4x package got the no.1 spot for the sales of all digital instruments on Big Fish Audio.[22], 44354=Soon after the V4x package release, she grabbed the Crypton top sales rankings and remained there for April 2015. On 1st of May, the site updated to reveal the package now in 3rd place behind Hatsune Miku V3. This was approx. the same length of time that the MEIKO V3 had spent at the same position in 2014 after its release before the Hatsune Miku V3 package had also pushed it back down again., 43428=Luka was the first VOCALOID to impact Hatsune Miku's popularity. Only a few days after her release, many songs were produced. On the 70th Weekly VOCALOID Ranking (February 2nd, 2009), many of Luka's songs appeared in the Top 30, knocking the very popular \"Miku Miku ni Shite Ageru\" and songs produced by ryo (with the exception of \"Melt\") right out of the Top 30. \"RIP=RELEASE\" had taken the #1 spot, and had earned a total of 843,233 points, making it the song with the highest one-week score., 52524=Luka has several figurines based on her. Exclusive figurines were sold during the 2009 Treasure festa event for Megurine Luka. During the 2009 and 2010 seasons she appeared in the Good smile racing figurine sets. A special \"Toeto\" figurine was also made based on the PV of the same name., 46244=Crypton's product list, 12/10/2011, Megurine Luka is in 3rd place, 45942=In October 2013, Luka's Vocaloid2 software disappeared off the top 10 products charts as the Hatsune Miku V3 and its bundle package disrupted the chart rankings.[21] Luka had already fallen to 6th place during the 2013 period as a result of Kaito's Kaito V3 release, but this was the first time Luka had disappeared from the charts., 56129=Crypton future Media applied for trademark for Luka on 29th of Jan 2015.[7], 45365=After the charts began to settle down again, Luka began to occupy the same spot on the charts that Kaito's original vocal previously occupied (6th-8th place), putting the popularity of the product on par with the older product. After Meiko's V3 release, Luka became the only member of the VOCALOID2 Character Vocal Series vocals to have a product on the charts, leaving her in 5th place. However, VOCALOID2 vocals were mostly absent from the rankings in April 2014. By mid-2014, both she and the VOCALOID2 Kagamine Rin\\Len package no longer held constant places in the rankings and were constantly on and off Crypton Future Media sales charts., 41348=In 2015 a survey was made based on the popularity of Vocaloids on website Nico Video. For the year 2014, Megurine Luka was the 7th most popular Vocaloid.[24], 51851=In 2011, Piapro held a contest with members to design Goth Lolita clothing for VOCALOIDs, to be produced by the company Putumayo. Amongst the winners were designs based on Luka's own attaire.[11], 46104=In 2010, Luka was ranked as the 3rd most popular VOCALOID product they sold.[20], 54961=A 3D data pack for the software Shade 12 Basic was announced as Megurine Luka 3D. The software pack contained data and a 3D model for the 3D animation \"Corruption Garden\" made using the software. The pack is now available in English.[9] A Blu-Ray featuring the PV was also put up for sale on the 8th of June 2011. The video was created by IKEDA. This is the only such pack for the 3D software package so far that features a VOCALOID vocalist. It includes four complete sets of clothing, pre-set poses and more.[10]}",
