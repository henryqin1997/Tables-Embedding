With that in mind, Black Hills State is great for students who like the outdoors, who enjoy meeting new people, and who like small classes. This is a small college, and great for students who want to live in a small town atmosphere. Tips for prospective students First - if you are person who enjoys getting involved, don't take the General Studies class! It goes into depth about what campus activities are going on and works to get students involved. Second - What you learn is up to you. Your teachers will help you when you need it, but you are in charge of what you learn. Third - Get involved. Join a club or a student organization about something",
