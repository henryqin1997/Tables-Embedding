Required element elementName In the tables in this document, we use the following conventions for required and optional elements: Typographical conventions The information in this document doesn't cover all possible properties and attribute values for kinds. Services may extend kinds, so a particular service may use properties and values not included in this document. Extensibility One approach that might help is to use the client libraries we provide rather than to try to construct kinds by hand. The client libraries provide various methods for adding and changing data in an entry of a given kind; see the client library documentation for details. It may be hard to figure out exactly what information you need to include when creating an entry of a particular kind, especially because some elements in the kinds contain other kinds. Creating kinds We also don't include information about standard Atom elements that would be meaningless in the given context; for example, <atom:summary> isn't used in the Contact kind, and although <atom:author> is a required element in an entry (unless it's specified in the parent feed), it doesn't have a useful meaning in the Contact kind.
