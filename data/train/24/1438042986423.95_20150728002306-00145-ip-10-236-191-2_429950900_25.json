            "Description",
            "HEAT DISSIPATING SILICONE GREASE COMPOSITIONS - A silicone grease composition comprising 3-30 wt % of an organopolysiloxane and 60-96.9 wt % of a heat conductive filler is diluted with a least volatile isoparaffin having a boiling point of 260-360\u00b0 C. Despite a heavy loading of heat conductive filler, the grease composition is easily applicable to heat sinks as a thin uniform coating. The composition is drastically increased in shelf stability at room temperature, easy to handle, and provides for good heat dissipation.",
            "HEAT-CONDUCTIVE SILICONE GREASE COMPOSITION - A heat-conductive silicone grease composition is provided comprising (A) a trialkoxysilyl-endcapped organopolysiloxane having a viscosity of 0.1-1,000 Pa\u00b7s at 25\u00b0 C., (B) a specific organopolysiloxane, (C) a heat-conductive filler, and (D) a condensation catalyst. The composition is amenable to coat at the initial, thereafter increases its viscosity with moisture at room temperature rather than curing so that it remains flexible, easy to re-work, and anti-sagging, eliminates a need for cold storage and for hot application, avoids any undesired viscosity buildup, is easy to manufacture, and has good heat transfer.",
            "MOISTURE-THICKENING HEAT-CONDUCTIVE SILICONE GREASE COMPOSITION - A heat-conductive silicone grease composition is obtained by combining (A) a hydroxyl-endcapped organopolysiloxane, (B) a specific organopolysiloxane, (C) a silane compound having at least three hydrolyzable radicals and/or a hydrolyzate thereof, (D) a thickening catalyst, and (E) a heat-conductive filler. The composition is storable at RT, has a low initial viscosity enough to coat, and after coating, thickens with moisture at RT so that it becomes anti-sagging, remains re-workable, and has durable heat resistance.",
