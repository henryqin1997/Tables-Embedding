All rights reserved., 12713=In the example, these typical report dimensions produce an expense listing where each report line is an expense account and the two primary columns are the year-to-date actual expenses as of December 1995 and December 1994., 34857=Period of interest: December 1996, 7976=The rows and columns determine the values which appear in the body of a simple report, by virtue of the attributes those rows and columns possess. For example, consider a row whose attribute is the balance sheet account named \"Inventory\" and a column whose attribute is \"Sept. 1996.\" A report \"cell\" defined by the intersection of row \"Inventory\" and column \"Sept. 1996,\" will contain the inventory account balance for September 1996., 303688=Note: The period you specify has a direct effect on any relative headings and period offsets which are defined as part of your report. For example, assume your report has two columns - one defined as &POI0 and one defined as &POI-6. If you enter DEC-96 as the Period, your report will include one column of values for December 1996 and one column of values for June 1996., 124446=For example, if you use the factor Thousands with the format mask 99,999,999.99, the number 23,910 will appear as 23.91 on your report. If you use the factor Percentiles with the format mask 99.99, the number .1258 will appear as 12.58 on your report. To display amounts using no factor, choose Units., 39492=Display account segment values and their descriptions. There is a Display option on the Row Order window where you can tell FSG to display the ledger short name, ledger name, or both for your ledger segment and the value, description, or both for your account segments. So, instead of Vision US West 01.200.1000, you can have FSG display Vision US West Vision Western US. 01 ABC Company. 200 Headquarters. 1000 Cash. Optionally, you can display the ledger short name, ledger name, description or account segment value by itself. If you use reporting currencies (journal or subledger level), you can specify a reporting currency in place of a ledger and have all of the functionality described above for your row orders defined with a reporting currency., 28530=The constant period of interest is determined by two parameters, the period number and the relative year. For example, assume you use a 12 period fiscal year based on a standard monthly calendar. For the column in the report representing the constant period of interest, you specify the period number to be 12 and the relative year to be a \u20131. When you run the FSG report for any of the periods between January to December 1996, the Constant Period of Interest column displays data for December, 1995. If you run the report for period March 1997, the Constant Period of Interest column displays data for December, 1996., 233071=Having defined a context-sensitive descriptive flexfield for the Segment Values window, you can now assign reporting attribute values to account segment values. For example, you might enter Joe Smith as the Fund Manager for Fund 12345., 27224=FSG uses the Period Offset to determine which specific periods' balances to include on a report. Period offsets are specified relative to the period you specify when you request that FSG run a report. For example, if you want a report of monthly cash balances for January, 1996 through December, 1996, the period-of-interest is DEC-1996. If one of your column definitions has a period offset of -6, FSG will display the cash balances for June, 1996 in that column.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The following table shows a sample row set for a simple report, using account assignments for a single ledger: An account assignment (a ledger specification and a range of accounts) or a description. You use a description row to display a subheading immediately above a group of related rows. A sequence number to indicate its order in the row set. Each row definition for a simple report includes, at a minimum: Rows are subcomponents of row sets. They are defined when you create a new row set. Defining Rows and Row Sets, and Assigning Accounts You may be able to build many of your financial reports by using the fourteen standard column sets we predefine, such as monthly comparative year-to-date or period-to-date variance. For more complex reports, you can define custom column sets. Standard Reusable Column Sets In the example, these typical report dimensions produce an expense listing where each report line is an expense account and the two primary columns are the year-to-date actual expenses as of December 1995 and December 1994. Generally, accounts are assigned to row definitions and amount types are assigned to column definitions. The example in the figure named Basic FSG Report Objects illustrates another important FSG concept: Typical Report Dimensions You can enable definition access set security to a row set or column set so that they can be used, viewed, or modified by certain users.
