individuals and families received expedited processing for SNAP benefits.\u00a0 In addition, in the past caseworkers would ask applicants for TANF about their living arrangements and monthly rent.\u00a0 These questions were dropped in 1996 for the SNAP and TANF programs because the State felt they were no longer required after PRWORA (federal regulations meant they were not mandated items to collect).\u00a0 It is considered unlikely that homelessness questions will be reinstated on the application because state officials want to keep the application as simple as possible and only ask questions absolutely necessary for eligibility determination.\u00a0 Also, in 2002 Iowa\u0092s emergency assistance program was eliminated.\u00a0 This program had been funded with TANF and state

Most who reported \u0093as needed updates\u0094 indicated that applications are updated at least every three years.\u00a0 No states indicated that their applications are updated more often than quarterly, but 10 percent of Medicaid and 4 percent of TANF applications were reported to be updated twice per year.\u00a0 In Florida, the application is updated 2-3 times per year in response to changes in eligibility requirements and to ensure that the form continues to be user friendly.\u00a0 Annual updates to applications are the practice for just over a quarter of all Medicaid programs and just under a quarter of TANF programs., 239733=At the time of the interview the state was revising the application and intake process for TANF and Medicaid. Before the changes, the typical approach was for applicants to complete the application in person at the Medicaid or TANF office, usually without assistance.\u00a0 For TANF applicants, an interview is done after the application is filled out.\u00a0 The combined application asks one of the homeless risk factors: \u0093Are you living with friends or relatives?\u0094\u00a0 This has only been included on the application since 2006, and the item is entered into a statewide database.\u00a0 Even though applicants are not explicitly asked if they are homeless when applying for benefits, there is a place in the state TANF database to document unusual living situations or lack of address.\u00a0 It might be possible to run a report from the database to tally the number of applicants who lack an address but this has never been attempted and the age of the system makes the interview respondent unsure about the reliability of the data and the ability to query it to assess this information., 472269=Specifically, under the \u0093Enrollment by eligibility status\u0094 category, the PIR asks programs to report on the number of children and families enrolled in the program who are homeless. Beginning in December 2007, the program defined \u0093homeless\u0094 using the McKinney-Vento Act definition.\u00a0 Program staff make their own determinations regarding whether families meet this definition; ACF staff were unsure if there are national training efforts or other standards in place to ensure the definition is being applied consistently., 36187=Given this context, the Department of Health and Human Services has been pursuing a strategy over the past several years of increasing access to mainstream resources for eligible homeless individuals and families. In the March 2003 report, Ending Chronic Homelessness: Strategies for Action, the HHS Secretary\u0092s Work Group on Ending Chronic Homelessness outlined sixteen strategies to reduce chronic homelessness, one of which was to \u0093improve the transition of clients from homeless-specific programs to mainstream service providers\u0094 (HHS, 2003b).\u00a0 A cornerstone activity under this strategy has been the development and implementation of nine Homeless Policy Academies that were designed to bring together state-level program administrators and homeless service providers in order to develop state-specific action plans designed to increase access to mainstream resources for persons experiencing homelessness.\u00a0 However, the key policy question, \u0093Has HHS been successful at improving access to mainstream service programs?\u0094 cannot yet be answered because no baseline data are available.\u00a0 At the federal level, most mainstream programs are not required to collect data related to the number of homeless clients served.\u00a0 This lack of baseline information about the number of homeless individuals and families served in HHS mainstream programs makes it difficult, if not impossible, for HHS to document improvements in access., 494400=Short Description: In 1990, Congress enacted Title XXVI Public Health Service (PHS) Act, commonly referred to as the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act (RWCA), mainly for the purpose of the improvement of quality and availability of care for low-income uninsured and underinsured individuals and families affected by HIV disease. Almost two decades later, the continuum of care services had changed tremendously from that which was contemplated in 1990. \u00a0Since the 2006 reauthorization, the RWCA title is now referred to as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act (Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program).\u00a0 The amended Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program was written to (a) reflect the shift in treatment for HIV towards a chronic disease model, (b) changes in the demographics of persons needing CARE Act services, and (c) changes in the health care financing environment.\u00a0 Ryan White HIV/AIDS programs are the \"payer of last resort.\u0094\u00a0 They fill gaps in care not covered by other resources.\u00a0 Ryan White clients include people with no other source of healthcare and those with Medicaid or private insurance whose care needs are not being met., 224442=StateHealthFacts.org. \u0093State Health Facts.\u0094\u00a0 The Henry J.
