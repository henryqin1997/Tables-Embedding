B.3.1.6\u00a0Lock Compatibility Table The interaction of a LOCK with various methods is dependent upon the lock type. However, independent of lock type, a successful DELETE of a resource MUST cause all of its locks to be removed.\u00b6 B.3.1.5\u00a0Interaction with other Methods If no Depth header is submitted on a LOCK request then the request MUST act as if a \"Depth:infinity\" had been submitted.\u00b6 If the Depth header is set to infinity then the resource specified in the Request-URI along with all its internal members, all the way down the hierarchy, are to be locked. A successful result MUST return a single lock token which represents all the resources that have been locked. If an UNLOCK is successfully executed on this token, all associated resources are unlocked. If the lock cannot be granted to all resources, a 207 (Multistatus) status code MUST be returned with a response entity body containing a multistatus XML element describing which resource(s) prevented the lock from being granted. Hence, partial success is not an option. Either the entire hierarchy is locked or no resources are locked.\u00b6 A Depth header of value 0 means to just lock the resource specified by the Request-URI.\u00b6 The Depth header may be used",
