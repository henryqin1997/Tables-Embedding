A pigmented mono-coat may be used in place of the base coat/clear coat. A number of clear and pigmented coating compositions have been utilized as automotive OEM and automotive refinish coatings, such as, primers, basecoats and clear coats but none meet the rapid curing times that are desired in combination with outstanding physical properties, such as, mar resistance and good flexibility. Such coating compositions can, if desired, have low volatile organic content (VOC)., 140994=The reaction mixture was heated to its reflux temperature and the water of reaction was collected from the water separator. The reaction progress was monitored by the amount of water collected. and the reaction temperature was not allowed to exceed 185\ufffd C. An additional 40 g of xylene was added throughout the reaction to maintain the reflux temperature below 185\ufffd C. When the amount of water collected approached theoretical amount of 224 g, acid number measurements were used to determine the end point, which was an acid number of less than 5. At a measured acid number of 3.0, the reactor was allowed to cool to 90\ufffd C. The reactor was held at 120\ufffd C. until reaction solids exceeded 95%. The reactor was allowed to cool to 90\ufffd C. and the polymer solution was thinned with 2537.3 g of polyethyleneglycol monomethyl ether. Forced air was used to cool the reactor to below 50\ufffd C., 66830=Two preferred highly branched copolyester polyols are (1) the reaction product of dimethylol propionic acid and caprolactone, and (2 the reaction product of dimethylol propionic acid, caprolactone and pentaerythritol. These polyols produce coating compositions that form coatings having excellent mar resistance, excellent flexibility and rapid cure., 50998=Current commercially available coating compositions do not have these unique characteristics of rapidly curing under ambient temperature conditions along with the ability to form a finish having improved mar resistance and flexibility. It would be advantageous to have a coating composition with this unique combination of properties., 114166=The above constituents are mixed with deionized water to form 1000 g of an aqueous cationic solution., 104483=Crockmeter-Wet Mar Resistance, 104545=Similar Procedure to that used in Crockmeter-Dry Mar Resistance above was used to test wet mar resistance, except the abrasive medium used was a wet alumina slurry instead of Bon Ami abrasive. The composition of the wet alumina slurry was as follows:, 118437=The viscosity of the pot mix (mixture of all of the components of the coating composition) of the coating compositions was measured by using the conventional Zahn #2 cup supplied by VWR Scientific Products Corporation. The viscosity was measured as soon as the pot mix was prepared. The reading was recorded as number of seconds it took for the pot mix to drain from the Zahn #2 cup [ASTM D1084 (Method D)]., 108877=Dry Mar Test, 51544=(a) a binder component, which comprises a highly branched copolyester polyol having a number average molecular weight ranging from 1000 to 30,000, hydroxyl groups ranging from 5 to 200 per polymer chain and carboxyl groups ranging from 0 to 40 per polymer chain, said copolyester polyol being polymerized from a monomer mixture containing a chain extender selected from the group consisting of a hydroxy carboxylic acid, a lactone of a hydroxy carboxylic acid and a combination thereof; and one or more hyper branching monomers, said hyper branching monomer having one carboxyl group and two hydroxyl groups, two carboxyl groups and one hydroxyl group, one carboxyl group and three hydroxyl groups, or three carboxyl groups and one hydroxyl group, and wherein the weight ratio of the hyper branching monomer to the chain extender in said monomer mixture ranges from 1/0.3 to 1/20; and, 103868=Panels, which have cured clearcoat over black basecoat, were coated with a thin layer of Bon Ami abrasive supplied by Faultless Starch/Bon Ami Corporation, Kansas City, Mo. The clearcoats had a dry coating thickness of 50 microns. The panels were then tested for mar damage for 10 double rubs against a green felt wrapped fingertip of A.A.T.C.C. Crockmeter (Model CM-1, Atlas Electric Devices Corporation, Chicago, Ill.) The dry mar resistance was recorded as percentage of gloss retention by measuring 20 deg. gloss of the marred areas versus non-marred areas of the coated panels., 87486=Melamines can be used along with polyisocyanates. Applicants have unexpectedly discovered that by substantially increasing the total amount of polyisocyanate and melamine in a crosslinking component of a coating composition, provided neither component is more than about half of the total composition solids, results in a low VOC coating composition having improved mar and etch resistance coupled with low application viscosity so long as the copolyester polyol is also included. Low molecular weight highly branched copolyester polyols are preferred to obtain even a lower coating application viscosity. Moreover, the foregoing combination also does not adversely affect other important coating properties, such as, gloss, DOI and other desired coating properties., 103806=Crockmeter-Dry Mar Resistance, 91957=Typically useful polyesters have a weight average molecular weight ranging from 1500 to 20,000 and a Tg in the range of \u221250\ufffd C. to +100\ufffd C. Some of the other suitable polyesters are also listed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,221,494 on column 5 and 6, which is incorporated herein by reference. The suitable polyester is the esterification product of an aliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid, a polyol, a diol, an aromatic or aliphatic cyclic anhydride and a cyclic alcohol. One preferred polyester is the esterification product of adipic acid, trimethylol propane, hexanediol, hexahydrophathalic anhydride and cyclohexane dimethylol., 86578=Many of these suitable monomeric melamines are supplied commercially. For example, Cytec Industries Inc., West Patterson, N.J. supplies Cymel\ufffd 301 (degree of polymerization of 1.5, 95% methyl and 5% methylol), Cymel\ufffd 350 (degree of polymerization of 1.6, 84% methyl and 16% methylol), 303, 325, 327 and 370, which are all monomeric melamines. Suitable polymeric melamines include high amino (partially alkylated, \u2014N, \u2014H) melamine known as Resimene\ufffd BMP5503 (molecular weight 690, polydispersity of 1.98, 56% butyl, 44% amino), which is supplied by Solutia Inc., St. Louis, Mo., or Cymel\ufffd 1158 provided by Cytec Industries Inc., West Patterson, N.J., 52823=mixing binder and crosslinking components of a coating composition to form a potmix, wherein said binder component comprises a highly branched copolyester polyol having a number average molecular weight ranging from 1000 to 30,000, hydroxyl groups ranging from 5 to 200 per polymer chain and carboxyl groups ranging from 0 to 40 per polymer chain, said copolyester polyol being polymerized from a monomer mixture containing a chain extender selected from the group consisting of a hydroxy carboxylic acid, a lactone of a hydroxy carboxylic acid and a combination thereof; and one or more hyper branching monomers, said hyper branching monomer having one carboxyl group and two hydroxyl groups, two carboxyl groups and one hydroxyl group, one carboxyl group and three hydroxyl groups, or three carboxyl groups and one hydroxyl group, and wherein the weight ratio of the hyper branching monomer to the chain extender in said monomer mixture ranges from 1/0.3 to 1/20; and, 107774=The pH of the slurry was maintained in the range of 7.6\u20138.0, and the viscosity was maintained at 125+/\u221210 poise (Brookfield #4 spindle at 10 rpm). To test the wet mar resistance, 0.7 m of the slurry was applied over the base-coated panels having cured clear-coats. The clear-coats had a dry coating thickness of 50 microns. The portions of panels coated with the slurry were then tested for mar damage for 10 double rubs against a green felt wrapped fingertip of A.A.T.C.C. Crockmeter (Model CM-1, Atlas Electric Devices). The wet mar resistance was recorded as percentage of gloss retention by measuring the 20 degree gloss of the marred areas versus non-marred areas of the coated panels., 50683=In automotive OEM, rapid dry and curing of a coating that forms a finish with excellent properties, such as, improved mar resistance and excellent flexibility is very desirable since it is possible to reduce baking temperatures and baking times thereby decreasing productions costs., 178712=These results show that the highly branched copolyester is very reactive at room temperature with fast film forming times (BK times), excellent swell ratios at early cure times (1 day at room temperature), and shows excellent final film properties such as Gel Fractions in most cases above 99%, good appearance, and excellent gravel and mar resistance., 48101=This application claim benefit of U.S. provisional Ser. No. 60/359,066 filed on Feb. 20, 2002., 116194=The above constituents are blend with deionized water to form 1000 g aqueous anionic solution., 87259=Cytec Industries Inc. also supplies Cymel\ufffd 1130 @ 80 percent solids (degree of polymerization of 2.5), Cymel\ufffd 1133 (48% methyl, 4% methylol and 48% butyl), both of which are polymeric melamines., 136842=The reaction mixture was heated to its reflux temperature and the water of reaction was collected from the water separator. The reaction progress was monitored by the amount of water collected, and the reaction temperature was not allowed to exceed 185\ufffd C. An additional 20 g of xylene was added throughout the reaction to maintain the reflux temperature below 185\ufffd C. When the amount of water collected approached theoretical (277 g), acid number measurements were used to determine the end point, which was an acid number of less than 5. At a measured acid number of 1.7, the reactor was allowed to cool to 120\ufffd C. Then, 4126.8 g of \u03b5-caprolactone was added slowly over a 15\u201320 minute period through an addition funnel. The reactor was held at 120\ufffd C. until the solids exceeded 95%. Then the reactor was allowed to cool to 90\ufffd C. and the resulting polymer solution was thinned with 1391.8 g methyl ethyl ketone. Forced air was used to cool the reactor to below 50\ufffd C., 84567=Clear coat compositions or pigmented mono-coat or basecoat compositions can be formulated with the highly branched copolyester polyol and a polyisocyanate as a crosslinking component. These compositions have excellent properties, such as, mar resistance, good gloss, DOI (Distinctness of Image) and rapid cure., 132906=The reaction mixture was heated to its reflux temperature and the water of reaction was collected from the water separator. The reaction progress was monitored by the amount of water collected, and the reaction temperature was not allowed to exceed 185\ufffd C. An additional 20 g of xylene was added throughout the reaction to maintain the reflux temperature below 185\ufffd C. When the amount of water collected approached theoretical amount of 286 g, acid number measurements were used to determine the end point that was an acid number of less than 5. At a measured acid number of 1.5, the reactor was allowed to cool to 120\ufffd C. Then, 2837.2 g of \u03b5-caprolactone was added slowly over a 15\u201320 minute period through an addition funnel. The reactor was held at 120\ufffd C. until reaction solids exceeded 95%. Then the reactor was allowed to cool to 90\ufffd C. and the resulting polymer solution was thinned with 598.2 g of ethyl 3-ethoxy propionate (EEP). Forced air was used to cool the reactor to below 50\ufffd C., 108497=Wet Mar Test, 54360=\u201cTwo-pack coating composition\u201d means a thermosetting composition comprising two components that are stored in separate containers, which are typically sealed for increasing the shelf life of the components of the coating composition. The components are mixed just prior to use to form a pot mix, which has a limited pot life, typically a few minutes, such as, 15 minutes to 45 minutes to a few hours, such as, 2 hours to 6 hours. The pot mix is applied as a layer of a desired thickness on a substrate surface, such as, an autobody. After application, the layer dries and cures to form a finish on the substrate surface having desired coating properties, such as mar resistance., 67213=The monomer mixture preferably includes dialkylol propionic acid, such as dimethylol propionic acid and caprolactone. The more preferred monomer mixture further includes pentaerythritol, trimethylol propane or more preferably pentaerythritol. A coating composition containing the resulting highly branched copolyester polyol forms coatings that have excellent mar resistance, excellent flexibility and rapid cure., 219799=The reaction rate of the highly branched copolyester (solution 2) with isocyanate was compared to other types of hydroxyl functional components such as an oligomer (Described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,221,494 B1; procedure #2) and a standard acrylic polymer (Described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,221,494 B1; procedure #9). This comparison was made using the isocyanurate trimer of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and the Isocyanurate trimer of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and blends of these two isocyanates (the ratios shown in the Table 3 below are on a weight basis of total isocyanate). The catalyst level was held constant at 500 ppm of dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL) on total binder and crosslinking components solids. The ratio of equivalents of isocyanate to hydroxyl was kept constant at 1.05/1. The reaction rate was measured on films at ambient conditions [23.9\ufffd C. (75\ufffd F.) @ 50% relative humidity] using an infrared spectrometer. The consumption of isocyanate functionality during the cure was followed by the loss of the isocyanate peak (at about 2270 cm\u22121) in the infrared at time intervals of \ufffd hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days.}",
