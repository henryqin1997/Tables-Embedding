            "Zim'Torga: After getting the K3 Elder, ride to the northeast, past Garm's Bane and to the ledge. You may die a few times along the way. Jump off the ledge of Storm Peaks, dying and rezzing in Zul'Drak by Thrym's End. Ride east, trying to reach the Argent Stand. If you die, you can spirit rez at Heb'Valor, which is very close. Take the eastern road out of the Argent Stand, heading north (left) at the fork. This is a main road and won't have too much aggro.",
            "Valiance Keep: Trickier than you think as the roads in central Borean are covered in hostile mobs. Take the road south from Warsong Hold--you will die at some point. Take the spirit rez at Riplash Strand and continue heading east on that new road. Once on the beach by Valiance Keep, you'll aggro the large Nerubians if they're not engaged by an Alliance NPC--you may die several times here as well. The NPC is outside the town to the north, but near a vendor that will aggro. Best to spam your macro.",
            "Star's Rest: From Agmar's Hammer, head south and west on the road. There are Alliance guars patrolling the road, so it's best to circle around the camp. Near the NPC are hostile guards and a Winter's Sister which make this even worse. Definitely one to spam your macro on."
