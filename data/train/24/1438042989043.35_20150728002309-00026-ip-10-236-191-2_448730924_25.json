His former job was to repair trains or locomotives. He began making tahu in 1996. He estimated a 5 kg loss for every 100 kg of soya bean processed due to burnt solution at the bottom of the wok. From his experience as a mechanic working with steam engines, he reasoned that if the soya bean solution was boiled with steam, there would be no losses due to burning. He developed steam boiling cookstove for tahu production that is the first of its kind., 15460=Qo = 8402.9 kcal/hr = 42014.66 kcal/batch, 17279=Qm,rhs = 2547 63 kcal/batch, 50297=Milk, the raw material, is bought from the community in the vicinity of the villages. The cost of the milk depends upon its fat content as that determines how much khuwa can be produced. In general, the supply of milk is met regularly.

Total profit per month (excluding tax) = Rs.6,620. Profit %, of the production cost = 23.2 Profit % of total investment = 169.1 VII. SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT Khuwa production is impaired by the lack of reliable, affordable fuelwood. Therefore a more efficient stove may be needed by the khuwa producers Based on analysis of stove used, same suggestions for future development are recommended as follows: The one-pot-hole stove, should be made into a three-pot-hole stove and the pot holder should be converted into an inverted cone shape as done in Sudal village of Bhaktapur District. This will help to use waste heat and to make the work environment more comfortable. In three-pot-hole stove, the combustion chamber should be reduced, baffles should be introduced. During the summer, the cooks suffer excess heat while they use the stove. They also suffer from smoke, thus a smoke extractor is recommended. The smoke extractor will not be directly coupled with the stove. The smoke extractor offers many advantages not generally associated with chimney stoves. The smoke extractor works on the principle that sufficient waste heat is available to rise up a chimney supported above the",
