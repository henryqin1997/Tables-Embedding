            "Rotational vehicle restraint system - A rotational vehicle restraint system includes an anchoring component configured to be attached to a vehicle seat assembly; a rotatable component attached to the anchoring component and configured to rotate relative to the anchoring component about an axis of rotation; and a harness connected to the rotatable component and configured to fit about a passenger. When installed in a vehicle, the rotational vehicle restraint system is configured to restrain a passenger fitted with the harness in both an upright sitting position and a lying down position. When installed in a vehicle, the rotational vehicle restraint system is also optionally configured to enable the passenger fitted with the harness to change from a first lying down position facing forward in the vehicle seat assembly to a second lying down position facing backward in the vehicle seat assembly.",

    "textAfterTable": "Patrick N. Jay, Farmington, MN US Patent application number Description Published 20100051062 Concrete Wash and Recovery System - A system for recovering concrete wash product includes a support frame mounted pivotally to a chassis of a transit concrete mixing vehicle, and a container mounted to the frame for arcuate movement with the frame, between a collecting position with the container disposed below a discharge chute of the vehicle, and a dispensing position with the container disposed adjacent an opening of a mixing drum of the vehicle. The container initially is placed in the collecting position to receive concrete wash product from the discharge chute by gravity as the chute is cleaned with water. After cleaning, the frame is pivoted to raise the container to the dispensing position, and a valve is opened to allow the concrete wash product to flow from the container into the mixing drum by gravity. In vehicles equipped with booster axle systems, the booster axle frame supports and positions the container, and also supports and positions the booster wheel/axle assembly. 03-04-2010 Phillip Lucas Jay, Spring, TX US Patent application number Description Published 20120158307 DOWNHOLE TEMPERATURE PROBE ARRAY - An apparatus includes a tool configured to operate within a borehole during a period wherein matter is being output from a surrounding earth formation into a flow of matter in the borehole. The tool includes a main tool",
