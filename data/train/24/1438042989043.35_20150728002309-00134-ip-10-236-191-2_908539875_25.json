            "There are clubs and activities that are available to participate in on the branch campus and also on main campus.",
            "Students get a lot more bang for the buck at this school because it is a branch campus.",
            "There is not much to do for fun simply because it is a branch campus, except for joining in activities on main campus, like joining a frat or sorority.",
            "There is food that is available on campus and off campus.",
            "There isn't really any dorm life at branch campuses.",
            "Academics are still challenging most of the time but it is a little bit easier because getting help from a teacher is a much easier task due to the small class sizes.",
            "Get on top of scholarships and loans in high school because ones school starts money is the last thing in mind between work, studying and different on campus activities.",
            "University of Cincinnati - Raymond Walters College is great for taking harder classes because there are smaller class sizes so it is easier to get any questions answered. Also, there is the option to take 49% of your classes at main campus for the price of being at the branch campus. Students at this college also gets all of the benefits as the students at main campus so joining different clubs or Greek life is still an option."

My biggest issue is, if you are a vet DO NOT GO HERE. The vets registration office is stuck in the 1950's with everything done by hand. As a result they WILL eventually screw up your hard earned benefits for life. Just like they did mine. Go somewhere, anywhere else. Bang for the buck It's way over priced. Unless you got a GI bill or have a mommy and daddy to take",
