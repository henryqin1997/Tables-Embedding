Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon conversion of preferred shares, exercise of stock options and warrants (calculated using the reverse treasury stock method). As of March 31, 2010 there were options and options outstanding to purchase 2.8 million shares, which exercise price averaged $4.56. The dilutive common shares equivalents, including convertible notes, preferred stock and warrants, of 407,361 shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, because the inclusion would be anti-dilutive. \u00a0 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by us, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, (the \u201cSEC\u201d).
