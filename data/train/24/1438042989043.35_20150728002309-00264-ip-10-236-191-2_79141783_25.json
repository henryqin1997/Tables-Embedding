An EOS file occupies a number of contiguous blocks, allocated upon file creation. EOS files can be any number of blocks, but are limited by the physical storage space available., 23649=The 6801 chip provides 2048 bytes of ROM, 128 bytes of RAM, and a UART. The Master 6801 is configured for single chip mode operation and runs, as do Adam's other 6801s, at a 1 MHz rate. This frequency is derived from an external 4 MHz crystal and the 6801's internal divide-by-4 circuitry., 69672=The RF modulator uses the 1889 chip to interface audio, color difference, and luminance signals to the antenna terminals of a TV receiver. It consists of two VHF channels, 3 or 4, selectable by a slide switch with determined LC tank circuits. The chroma subcarrier is derived from the 3.58 MHz system clock to ensure accuracy and stability. The sound oscillator's frequency modulator is achieved by using a 4.5 MHz tank circuit and deviating the center frequency via a varactor diode. Due to the incompatible signal level between the VDP 9928 and the 1889, a DC restoration circuit ensures the DC level of the video signal, 109991=The EOS file manager accesses and controls a file through a File Control Block (FCB) maintained in RAM. The FCB contains static and dynamic information about the file. THe FCB is created when a file is opened and destroyed when the file is closed. Application programs are limited to two FCBs at any one time. Each FCB is 36 bytes long. A data buffer, 1024 bytes long, is associated with each FCB.}",

Refer to Subsection 2.1.9 for pin connections. 2.1.7\u00a0\u00a0Card Edge Expansion Connectors A quad comparator circuit provides data to and from the Master 6801 microcomputer via a half-duplex 62.5 kilobaud serial network called AdamNET. The comparator can also reset all the devices on AdamNET via MIOC control. AdamNET links the tape drive, printer, and keyboard to the Master 6801. Each of these peripherals has a 6801 and a quad comparator circuit that controls AdamNET. Besides the data signal and reset signal, ground and power are provided as part of the AdamNET bus. 2.1.6.\u00a0\u00a0AdamNet Interface Circuitry The dynamic RAM circuit consists of eight 64K RAM chips arranged so that each represents one specific data bus bit.
