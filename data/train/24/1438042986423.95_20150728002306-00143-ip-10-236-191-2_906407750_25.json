            "Unfortunately, there are not a lot of extra activities for students to do on campus but the school itself is not too far from many sources of entertainment within the city itself.",
            "Students are limited to one source of food on campus, the limited hours often cause student-athletes, like myself, to miss meals regularly.",
            "The dorm life on campus is somewhat lacking in comparison to the rest of the campus. Many residents, myself included, have noticed several improvements that could be made to the areas of the school set aside for student living.",
            "As a transfer student, I have found a noticeable difference in the level of difficulty related to the courses I have completed. These courses, however, are taught by very knowledgeable instructors with a great deal of detail and passion.",
            "All prospective students should take into consideration each and every potential college that meets their base needs in areas relating to their intended major, the vicinity of the school as related to how close or far they wish to be from their home/family, and the amount of money that they are willing to be accountable for paying on tuition.",
            "The school is a small private, religious college. Its located on a very small, but beautiful campus in Chicago. The level of academic excellence in the classroom is held to a high, but realistic, standard."

This is The Streak. Enough said., 1224=Because North Park is in an urban setting they received a lot of funding from the city. Instead of using the money for the campus they gave the money to the students. In 2008 the tuition for north park actually decreased., 72863=Freshman streak! In April fool's day, all freshman guys get naked and run around the campus in front of whole student body at midnight. People come out to watch them, yes. Neighborhood complains annually but every time they call the police, oh well, what's done is done.}",

It is a school with a lot of diversity among the students, as well as the professors. Tips for prospective students Here is a tip for students that are thinking about coming here, when you come to the school for your visit ask your tour guide about the location of the OLDEST tree in Chicago. (It is right on campus, in the middle of the green space). Also, if you do decide to attend this university, make sure that you know all of your professor's names and try and make sure they remember yours for good reasons. Bang for the buck This school really does give you a lot more than what your paying for. For instance, the work-out facility, Helwig, was completed in the fall of 2006 Helwig",
