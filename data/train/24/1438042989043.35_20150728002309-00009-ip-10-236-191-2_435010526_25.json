Killeen, who is also a qualified coach, was threatening to break into the international set-up in 2000 when he snapped his ankle ligaments and missed a year of cricket. He since established himself as a reliable member of the Durham attack and was part of the team that secured Durham's historic first piece of silverware, the Friends Provident Trophy, in 2007 when they beat Hampshire in the competition's final at Lord's. He remained a respected presence in the dressing room as Durham became the dominant force in Championship cricket with successive titles and retired, aged 34, at the end of the 2010 season., 35060=Born October 17, 1975, Shotley Bridge, Co Durham, 72073=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 31754=Paul Hindmarch, 52226=Sam Collins September 2010, 56153=Aug 19, 2007, 55284=Jul 4, 2008, 57113=Sep 3, 2006}",
