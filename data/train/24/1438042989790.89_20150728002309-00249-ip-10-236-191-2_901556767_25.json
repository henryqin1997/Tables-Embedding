            "Campus security is always just around the corner. The campus police are able to answer calls at any point around campus within minutes. There are conveniently located emergency stations everywhere around campus that provide a convenient means of summoning emergency responders.",
            "I am not certain.",
            "There are always upbeat events that are hosted by different clubs around the campus. There are a wide range of clubs that can be joined.",
            "Great for all types! Technology, Art, Business and many other students are all welcome and would feel at home in this community.",
            "The campus hosts many university pride days and it's popular to go support the Sun Devil team at the Sun Devil Stadium downtown!",
            "A very fun, upbeat campus!",
            "There are many options when it comes to ASU. The Phoenix area is a close metropolitan city surrounded by mountains. For those interested in the city, there are multiple options for large shopping, dining and entertainment centers. For the sportsman, there are the mountains which show off the desert beauty. If you don't like the desert, then pine forests are an hour and a half away.",
            "Lots of good food! ASU has many options when it comes to food and dining. There are usually many options as well.",
            "From what I have seen (which isn't much), dorm life seems pretty good. The dorms are generally conveniently located and have a number of options.",
            "The class will probably be somewhat rigorous, but not extreme!",
            "Read the books! The readings and (sometimes) the video lectures will be your only means of learning. There is not much in-class, face-to-face time with the teacher that enables you to get questions resolved quickly. If you send an email, teachers will often answer back very quickly, but it does not take the place of conversing with the teacher. Keep in touch with the system to see all of the announcements!",
            "This college is great for those who are trying to get a degree while working full time due to the flexible schedule and ease of access. Be prepared to put in a good deal of work and reading; teachers often have to make up for class times by inserting video, audio and power point lectures to supplement the chapters. Anyone who tries it will probably be on the computer for long periods, but overall it's a great way to go!"
