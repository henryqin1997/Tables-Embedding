Eleven of these stations already have Alaskan Class A facilities and are to be protected accordingly. Permanent designation of the other four stations as Alaskan Class A is conditioned on their constructing minimum Alaskan Class A facilities no later than December 31, 1989. Until that date or until such facilities are obtained, these four stations shall be temporarily designated as Alaskan Class A stations, and calculations involving these stations should be based on existing facilities but with an assumed power of 10 kW. Thereafter, these stations are to be protected based on their actual Alaskan Class A facilities. If any of these stations does not obtain Alaskan Class A facilities in the period specified, it is to be protected as a Class B station based on its actual facilities. These four stations may increase power to 10 kW without regard to the impact on co-channel Class B stations. However, power increases by these stations above 10 kW (or by existing Alaskan Class A stations beyond their current power level) are subject to applicable protection requirements for co-channel Class B stations. Other stations not on the original list but which meet applicable requirements may obtain Alaskan Class A status by seeking such designation from the Commission.

To determine the value of the groundwave field intensity corresponding to a value of inverse distance field other than 100 mV/m at 1 kilometer, multiply the field strength as given on these graphs by the desired value of inverse distance field at 1 kilometer divided by 100; for example, to determine the groundwave field strength for a station with an inverse distance field of 2700 mV/m at 1 kilometer, simply multiply the values given on the charts by 27. The value of the inverse distance field to be used for a particular antenna depends upon the power input to the antenna, the nature of the ground in the neighborhood of the antenna, and the geometry of the antenna.

(See \u00a773.30). Improvement factors relate to both nighttime and daytime interference conditions and are based on two distinct considerations: (a) Service area lost by other stations due to interference caused by the subject station, and (b) service area of the subject station. These considerations are represented by a ratio. The ratio consists, where applicable, of two separate additive components, one for nighttime and one for daytime. For the nighttime component, to determine the numerator of the ratio (first consideration), calculate the RSS and associated service area of the stations (co- and adjacent channel) to which the subject station causes nighttime interference. Next, repeat the RSS and service area calculations excluding the subject station. The cumulative gain in the above service area is the numerator of the ratio. The denominator (second consideration) is the subject station's interference-free service area. For the daytime component, the composite amount of service lost by co-channel and adjacent channel stations, each taken individually, that are affected by the subject station, excluding the effects of other assignments during each study, will be used as the numerator of the daytime improvement factor. The denominator will consist of the actual daytime service area (0.5 mV/m contour) less any area lost to interference from other assignments. The value of this combined ratio will constitute the petitioner's improvement factor. Notwithstanding the requirements of \u00a773.153, for uniform comparisons and simplicity, measurement data will not be used for determining improvement factors and FCC figure M-3 ground conductivity values are to be used exclusively in accordance with the pertinent provisions of \u00a773.183(c)(1)., 626167=Source: 72 FR 45692, Aug. 15, 2007, unless otherwise noted., 108431=(e) An application for an authorization in the 1605-1705 kHz band which has been selected through the petition process (See \u00a773.30) is not required to demonstrate compliance with paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section.

The following table of allotments contains the digital television (DTV) channel allotments designated for the listed communities in the United States, its Territories, and possessions. The initial DTV Table of Allotments was established on April 3, 1997, to provide a second channel for DTV service for all eligible analog television broadcasters. Requests for addition of new DTV allotments, or requests to change the channels allotted to a community must be made in a petition for rule making to amend the DTV Table of Allotments. A request to amend the DTV table to change the channel of an allotment in the DTV table will be evaluated for technical acceptability using engineering criteria set forth in \u00a773.623(c). A request to amend the DTV table to add a new allotment will be evaluated for technical acceptability using the geographic spacing criteria set forth in \u00a773.623(d). DTV allotments designated with an asterisk are assigned for use by non-commercial educational broadcast stations only. Stations operating on DTV allotments designated with a \u201cc\u201d are required to comply with paragraph (g) of this section. Rules governing noncommercial educational TV stations are contained in \u00a773.621. Where there is only one technically available channel available in a community, an entity that would be eligible to operate a noncommercial educational broadcast station may, prior to application, initiate a rulemaking proceeding requesting that an unoccupied or new channel in the community be changed or added as reserved only for noncommercial educational broadcasting upon demonstrating that the noncommercial educational proponent would provide a first or second noncommercial educational TV service to 2,000 or more people who constitute 10% of the population within the proposed allocation's noise limited contour., 557376=[51 FR 17028, May 8, 1986], 271516=(3) With respect to the root-sum-square values of interfering field strengths referred to in this section, calculation is accomplished by considering the signals on the three channels of concern (co- and first adjacencies) in order of decreasing magnitude, adding the squares of the values and extracting the square root of the sum.

Such applications shall set forth the intent to share time and shall be filed in the same manner as are applications for new stations. They may be filed at any time, but in cases where the parties are unable to agree on time sharing, action on the application will be taken only in connection with the renewal of application for the existing station. In order to be considered for this purpose, such an application to share time must be filed no later than the deadline for filing petitions to deny the renewal application of the existing licensee, or, in the case of renewal applications filed by the existing licensee on or before May 1, 1995, no later than the deadline for filing applications in conflict with the such renewal applications., 333803=(5) The antenna power of the station shall be maintained at the authorized level during all field measurements.

The proposed station specifies geographic coordinates of 40\u00b000\u203200\u2033 N and 100\u00b000\u203200\u2033 W and the station to be protected is located at an azimuth of 45\u00b0 true at geographic coordinates of 44\u00b026\u203205\u2033 N and 93\u00b032\u203254\u2033 W. The critical angles of radiation as determined from Figure 6a of \u00a773.190 for use with Class B stations are 9.6\u00b0 and 16.6\u00b0. If the vertical pattern of the antenna of the proposed station in the direction of the existing station is such that, between the angles of 9.6\u00b0 and 16.6\u00b0 above the horizon the maximum radiation is 260 mV/m at one kilometer, the value of the 50% field, as derived from Formula 1 of \u00a773.190, is 0.06217 mV/m at the location of the existing station. To obtain the value of the 10% field, the 50% value must be adjusted by a factor derived from Formula 2 of \u00a773.190. The value in this case is 8.42 dB. Thus, the 10% field is 0.1616 mV/m. Using this in conjunction with the co-channel protection ratio of 26 dB, the resultant nighttime limit from the proposed station to the licensed station is 3.232 mV/m., 644456=[28 FR 13651, Dec. 14, 1963, as amended at 35 FR 7558, May 15, 1970; 47 FR 36178, Aug. 19, 1982; 49 FR 29069, July 18, 1984; 63 FR 33877, June 22, 1998; 65 FR 36378, June 8, 2000], 241999=[66 FR 20756, Apr. 25, 2001], 616915=[28 FR 13623, Dec. 14, 1963, as amended at 52 FR 25866, July 9, 1987], 336672=(i) Any Class B or Class D operation authorized before November 30, 1959; or, 440176=[30 FR 12711, Oct. 6, 1965], 86685=[28 FR 13574, Dec. 14, 1963, as amended at 38 FR 5874, Mar. 5, 1973; 49 FR 43960, Nov. 1, 1984; 50 FR 40014, Oct. 1, 1985; 52 FR 11654, Apr. 10, 1987; 53 FR 1031, Jan. 15, 1988; 56 FR 64857, Dec. 12, 1991], 517855=[52 FR 37789, Oct. 9, 1987, as amended at 54 FR 14964, Apr. 14, 1989; 54 FR 35339, Aug. 25, 1989; 56 FR 27426, June 14, 1991; 62 FR 50521, Sept. 26, 1997; 63 FR 33876, June 22, 1998], 294976=It is desired to determine whether objectionable interference exists between a proposed 5 kW Class B station on 990 kHz and an existing 1 kW Class B station on first adjacent channel, 1000 kHz. The distance between the two stations is 260 kilometers and both stations operate nondirectionally with antenna systems that produce a horizontal effective field of 282 in mV/m at one kilometer. (See \u00a773.185 regarding use of directional antennas.) The ground conductivity at the site of each station and along the intervening terrain is 6 mS/m. The protection to Class B stations during daytime is to the 500 \u00b5V/m (0.5 Vm) contour using a 6 dB protection factor. The distance to the 500 \u00b5V/m groundwave contour of the 1 kW station is determined by the use of the appropriate curve in \u00a773.184. Since the curve is plotted for 100 mV/m at a 1 kilometer, to find the distance of the 0.5 mV/m contour of the 1 kw station, it is necessary to determine the distance to the 0.1773 m/Vm contour., 176471=[56 FR 64860, Dec. 12, 1991; 57 FR 43290, Sept. 18, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 27950, May 12, 1993], 157117=[41 FR 7405, Feb. 18, 1976], 112399=[56 FR 64858, Dec. 12, 1991; 57 FR 43290, Sept. 18, 1992], 88107=Note: Until superseded by a new agreement, protection of the Bahama Islands shall be in accordance with NARBA.
