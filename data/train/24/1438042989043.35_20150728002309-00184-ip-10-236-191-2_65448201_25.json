Tracing the usage of a plant name via Prakrit/Sanskrit, Pali, Sinhala, Tamil gives us clues about the highly contested migrations of people in ancient times. The Sanskrit (or Pali) names, together with the Tamil names, provide clues to the etymology and ethno-botanical migrations and adoption of names. The Sanskrit names are often found in Ayurvedic texts. This tabulation is NOT a comprehensive or authoritative list, but a preliminary list made by us for our use, but made freely available to the public with no liability on us. Use a slash to open a dialog box where you can type the sinhala name in roman letters (e.g., Ehela, or Aehaela, Waraka or Varaka) to locate the botanical (Latin) name. Use the Latin names in Google to locate pictures of the plant, and references to the scientific literature.
