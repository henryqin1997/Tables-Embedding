            "I feel extremely safe when I am on campus. There is a strong police presence, Purdue has its own police and fire department, the west lafayette police and fire department are near by, along with the lafayette police and fire, and the tippecanoe police and fire. This presence in my opinion has limited the number of crimes committed on campus. Purdue also sends out emergency text alerts to tell students of any kind of danger, whether it be crime related or severe weather related.",
            "There is a strong greek presence on campus, it is by no means the majority, but it is definitely felt. The greek community on campus for the most part have good reputations, and are invested into the university.",
            "There are clubs for nearly any type of things on campus. During the first few weeks of school, all the clubs will do advertising, where people can come and see what their clubs are all about.",
            "Purdue is honestly great for any type of student. The campus is so large and so diverse, that there are things for anyone and everyone.",
            "1. Don't walk underneath the bell tower. The tradition is that if you walk underneath the bell tower that you will not graduate on time. 2. Fountain Runs: Students often go on fountain runs, which is where they run through the numerous fountains on campus. 3. The clapping circle: located outside the north end of the student union, is a study area which is shaped in a circular pattern, and when on claps while in the center of it, a funny noise is made.",
            "Purdue has a great relationship with employers, leading to a high number of Purdue grads to be hired directly from school and often after meeting with them at Purdue sponsored career fairs. This makes going to Purdue much worth it because of the increased likelihood of receiving a job upon graduation.",
            "There are countless numbers of clubs one could be in for fun, intramurals are very popular, and hanging out with friends. West lafayette is a normal college town, which offers most of the same types of amenities such as movie theaters, places to eat, bowling (a bowling alley is located in the basement of the student union), and for the older crowd, bars. One can find just about anything they want to do while they are around Purdue. Not to mention all the free stuff that takes place around campus. The university usually sponsors guest lecturers, free movie screenings, events at the union, and many other things.",
            "The on campus dining, or dining halls are amazing. For one it is a buffet at every meal, so no student should go hungry, but the greatness does not stop there. For the quality of the food is top notch, you can tell they put a lot of work into their dining services. The menus are almost different at every meal, so one does not get too burnt out on the same thing everyday. The dining services also provide on the go meals and snacks for those who do not want to sit down and eat or don't have the time because of a busy schedule. This makes things very convenient for students who are off to class in a hurry. The off campus food is just as convenient. There is so much to choose from around West Lafayette, and most places always are offering great deals, so one should never break the wallet on a late night snack or dinner.",
            "Purdue offers many different resident halls with many different perks. There are halls for primarily freshmen, those for upperclassmen, for graduate students; halls that are more apartment like, or suite like. There is a hall for everyone, and with each hall comes great Resident assistants. Purdue has invested a lot into their resident assistants so that they can create senses of community in their resident halls for the students. This can definitely be seen with the level of involvement students show during the school year in the dorms.",
            "Purdue has a demanding set of standards for its students, especially those who find themselves in a technical major such as engineering. One may find themselves studying very hard just to get by, as opposed to studying really hard to achieve an A.",
            "Go to school with an open mind. Join all the clubs you can, and get involved. There is so much opportunity on campus, so go there and find what you like, and if what you like isn't there create it. I imagine you are not the only one out 40,000+ students with that idea.",
            "A diverse campus full of opportunity to meet people from all walks of life. A university with a fun atmosphere; great sporting events, campus sponsored events, and all sorts of social gatherings. A school with challenging courses and curriculum, but also rewarding in that it enables students to be the best prepared in the professional world."

Usually, after a winning home game, the student section will sprint across campus and run through the two fountains in celebration. It is especially great on hot days in august and september! Also, you have to make a stop at the discount den and buy a den pop (yes, we call it pop, not soda). A den pop allows you to mix different drinks together, all for a cheap price., 886002=There are over 1000 clubs on campus, I'm sure you can find something!, 168321=Definitely take a tour. This lets you get a feel for the dorms and how far they will be from your classes. If your from out of state, definitely ask about the weather. Several of my friends had to make emergency trips to Walmart because they didn't have any winter clothing. If you can, try leaving your winter clothes at home for the warm months, and then switching your wardrobe over a break, so that you don't bring more clothes than you have room for, because you won't need that cute turtleneck sweater in August., 1103428=When you apply, be creative and be yourself. Apply by November 1st so that you can be considered for Scholarships and Honors College., 124742=Friday night's before home football games there is a walk with the team over the bridge . The marching band plays for the crowd as they march through the campus before each home game ., 152267=Do not schedule classes before 8:30 am ever and meet as many people as possible. There are 20,000 different students at Purdue, surely there is someone that you can connect with and friends make the experience that much better!, 877891=Try and really reach out during BGR, but don't feel bad if you don't click with the people from your group! My best friends were ones that I met through my roommate. Also, if you want to get an apartment, sign in October to get the best choice! We signed early November, and we were almost too late!, 856517=I've only been there once, but it was a fun experience. I learned a lot about Purdue, and may attend this coming fall of 2013., 435076=hanging out with friends are always great, going to the union is a good option. you can bowl or play pool, or simply just have a cup of coffee and chat with friends. the new gym will be completed in the fall of 2012, so you will have a great new place to workout and play sports. joining a club is always a good idea, there's no better way to meet other people who likes what you like too., 1082302=Very safe environment. Police officers are always around. Here is Purdue 2012-2013 Annual Security Report: http://www.purdue.edu/police/pdf/YourCampus.pdf, 746097=With almost 1000 clubs to join Purdue is the place for working out and having fun. JThey also just built a new recreation center as well which boasts a ton of sporting facilities and equipment. There is always something to do at Purdue in the fun sense., 694910=I've walked around at 3:30 am and felt perfectly at home.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I am in the nursing program and joined a learning community. This is where around 20 freshman nursing students get put in most of the same classes and are put in the same resident hall. This helps with finding people to study with and is a great way to easily make some new friends. Most of the programs have learning communities and I would recommend getting into one. It is not absolutely necessary for success in college but it might help make things a little bit easier.
