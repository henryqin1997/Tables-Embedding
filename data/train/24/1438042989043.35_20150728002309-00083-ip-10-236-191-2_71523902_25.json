In event of death of a member provision was made for decent burial, and all the members as far as possible obtained permits to attend the funeral. Here and again their plan of getting together was brought into play. In Richmond they would go to the church by ones and twos and there sit as near together as convenient. At the close of the service a line of march would be formed when sufficiently far from the church to make it safe to do. It is reported that the members were faithful to each other and that every obligation was faithfully carried out. This was the first form of insurance known to the Negro from which his family received a benefit.*, 231257=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a report to the General Conference of 1900 at Columbus, O., Rev.

It was these latter that in most cases grew out of the church organizations., 1264415=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The People's Shoe Co.

Nearly all of the societies are beneficial, but they may be divided in general into two classes, those beneficial merely and those with secret features. In order to help one another in sickness and provide for decent burial, through a system of small but regular payments, beneficial societies were formed among little groups of acquaintances or fellow laborers. In Baltimore they date back to 1820, and were afterwards specially exempted from the state laws forbidding meetings of colored people. Twenty-five, at least, had been formed before the war; from 1865 to 1870, seventeen or more were formed; since 1870, twenty or more have been added, several as late as 1884 and 1885. The number of members vary from a dozen to over 100., 599231=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a026.

The first Negro newspaper in the United States was begun in New York City, March 30, 1827, and was called The Journal of Freedom . Its editor was John B. Russworm, a graduate of Dartmouth College of the class of 1826, perhaps the first Negro to receive a degree from an American institution of learning. Associated with him in the editing was the Rev. Samuel E. Cornish, a controversialist of no mean powers., 116672=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first thing that vexed the Northern armies on Southern soil was the question of the disposition of the fugitive slaves. Butler confiscated them, Fremont freed them and Halleck caught and returned them, but their numbers swelled to such proportions that the mere economic problem of their presence overshadowed everything else, especially after the Emancipation proclamation. Lincoln was glad to have them come after once he realized their strength to the Confederacy. In 1864,, 183630=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A convention at Rochester, N. Y., in 1853 pronounced against emigration,, 502168=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1885 was incorporated the Colored Mutual Benefit Association, the only one in the state, entirely managed by colored men, with a colored doctor and a prominent colored lawyer for counsel. It is endorsed by all the clergymen, has grown rapidly and proven itself worthy of the support of the people. In these first few years, some $10,000 have been paid out in benefits. *, 1045617=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This company was organized in October, 1900, with a total paid in capital of $102., 120559=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colored men in that vicinity were soon enlisted as soldiers and an effort was made to cause the laborers left on each plantation, under plantation superintendents appointed for the purpose, to raise sufficient cotton and corn for their own support, rations being given from the Commissionary Department only when necessary to prevent absolute starvation. These conditions were, with hardly an interruption, continued until the spring of 1865., 1122660=plantation, making some profit by the transaction. Others were permitted to go North, where they would have more opportunity to earn money, and here, by dint of hard work and most exacting economy, they would manage to collect the price of their liberty. In 1835 there were a large number in Cincinnati thus working out their freedom, the masters retaining their \"free papers\" for security. One woman paid for herself $400, and then earned enough to buy a little home valued at $600, every dollar earned by washing and ironing. The majority of freedom earners, as soon as their own was paid for, at once began to work for the freedom of a father, mother, brother or sister, who were still in slavery. Four-fifths of the colored people in that city had members of their families yet in bondage. Of course, it was only the kinder and more indulgent masters who would allow slaves to work their freedom. *, 655510=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The insurance feature of the work shows that the reserve fund of $2,555.45 on hand in 1898 amounted in 1905 to $38,635.48. Nearly the whole fund is paid out, 434991=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States Bureau of Education in its report for 1905 lists 161 private schools for Negroes in the United States. Of these 74 of the largest and most important have given us figures showing:, 290370=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rev. Lot Carey, who was a slave in Richmond, Va., purchased his freedom in 1813, raised $700 for missions in Africa, and was the first missionary from America to Africa. From the days of Lisle and Carey the Negro Baptists of America have been prosecuting missionary work in the West India Islands and in Africa. They have four general organizations of their own through which they are doing missionary work in this and in other lands, besides many Negro churches contribute to both Home and Foreign Missions through the missionary organizations of their white Baptist brethren. *, 79123=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1790 this society had \u00a342 9s. 1d. on deposit in the Bank of North America., 1274101=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ohio Settlements.--These were made before the war, and with little or no outside aid, except in Brown county.

They were similar in character and condition to those already described. Their virtues, their vices, their poverty, their sicknesses, their labors, their idleness, their excess of joy and their extremes of suffering were told to our home people by every returning soldier or agent or by the missionaries who were soliciting the means of relief. Soon in the North an extraordinary zeal for humanity, quite universal, sprang up, and a Christian spirit which was never before exceeded began to prevail. The result was the organizing of numerous new bodies of associated workers whose influence kept our country free from the ills attending emancipation elsewhere; it saved us from Negro insurrection, anarchy and bloody massacre, with which the proslavery men and even the conservative readers of history had threatened the land., 1237738=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*National Negro Business League, 1900, pp. 189-90., 1238750=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*National Negro Business League, 1902, p. 71., 497270=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1884 was held a meeting of many connected with these societies to arouse a more general interest in the work, and very interesting reports were presented. Forty of them gave an aggregate membership of over 2,100.

In 1835 Cincinnati expended $1,000 in sustaining colored schools, of which the colored people gave $150, the rest being contributed by their friends. In 1839 the colored people paid $889.03, and the self-sacrifice was not as great as in 1835, which showed a marked economic as well as intellectual advancement. We must bear in mind that few employments but day labor were open to the colored people in the cities at that time, and while in the rural sections the men were mostly small, 112818=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soon after the Fugitive Slave Law was passed John Brown visited Springfield, Massachusetts, where he had formerly lived. The Valley of Connecticut had long been a line of underground travel and citizens of Springfield, colored and white, had become identified with operations on this line. Brown at ones decided that the new law made organization necessary, and be formed, therefore, the League of Gileadites to resist systematically the enforcement of the law. The name of this order was significant in that it contained a warning to those of its members that should show themselves cowards: \"Whosoever is fearful or afraid let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.\" In the \"Agreement and Rules\" that John Brown drafted from the order, adopted January 15,1851, the following directions for action were laid down: \"Should one of your number be arrested, you must collect together as quickly as possible so as to outnumber your adversaries . . . . . . Let no able bodied man appear on the ground unequipped or with his weapons exposed to view. . . . . . Your plans must be known only to yourselves and with the understanding that all traitors must die wherever caught and proven guilty. Let the first blow be the signal for all to engage. . . . . . Make lean work with your enemies, and be sure you meddle not with any others. . . . . After effecting a rescue, if you are assailed, go into the houses of your most prominent and influential white friends with your wives, and that will effectually fasten upon them the suspicion of being connected with you, and will compel them to make a common cause with you . . . . . . You may make a tumult in the court-room where the trial is going on by burning gunpowder freely in paper packages . . . . . .

The school was broken up in 1862 by incendiaries., 31518=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1898 the Atlanta Conference made a limited study entitled \"Some Efforts of American Negroes for their Own Social Betterment.\" The present study is a continuation and enlargement of this initial study made nearly ten years ago, with certain limitations and changes. The question set before us in the present study is: How far is there and has there been among Negro Americans a conscious effort at mutual aid in earning a living? In answering this question we must first consider just how broad an interpretation we are giving to the phrase, \"earning a living.\" In a highly developed economic society like that which surrounds us here in America and in other countries under the lead of European civilization, the phrase \"earning a living\" is pretty clear, because there are large numbers of persons engaged simply or principally in that occupation; and all persons recognize the efforts toward earning a living as a distinct set of efforts in their general life. It must be remembered, however, that this situation is, to an extent, abnormal; that neither in the undeveloped races nor in the fully developed Race, when it comes, will earning a living as such, occupy the large space that it does today in human endeavor. Among the semi-civilized races the work of getting the material things necessary for life is looked upon as incidental to a great many other larger and, in their opinion, better things, such as hunting, resting, eating and perhaps carousing. So, too, in an ideal community, we would expect that the purely economic efforts to supply human beings at least with the necessities of life would occupy a comparatively small part of the community for short spaces of time., 361224=governments. The earlier state constitutions of Mississippi \"from 1817 to 1865 contained a declaration that 'Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good governments, the preservation of liberty and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.' It was not, however, until 1868 that encouragement was given to any general system of public schools meant to embrace the whole youthful population. In Alabama the Reconstruction Constitution of 1868 provided that \"It shall be the duty of the Board of Education to establish throughout the state, in each township or other school district which it may have created, one or more schools at which all the children of the state between the ages of 5 and 21 years may attend free of charge.\" In Mississippi the constitution of 1868 makes it the duty of the legislature to establish \"a uniform system of free public schools, by taxation or otherwise, for all children between the ages of 5 and 2l years.\" Arkansas in 1868, Florida in 1869, Louisiana in 1868, North Carolina in 1869, South Carolina in 1868 and Virginia in 1870 established school systems. The constitution of 1868 in Louisiana required the General Assembly to establish \"at least one free public school in every parish,\" and that these schools should make no \"distinction of race, color, or previous condition.\" Georgia's system was not fully established until 1873. *, 1212500=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0March 20, 1907: Since the report on the foregoing pages was made to the company there has been continuous development done on the property of this company., 347736=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The most elaborate system, perhaps, was that under General Banks in LOUISIANA. It was established in 1863, and soon had a regular Board of Education, which laid and collected taxes and supported eventually nearly a hundred schools with 10,000 pupils under 162 teachers. *, 1201319=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The New Century Cotton Mills, Dallas, Texas, began operation and training of its operatives January 5, 1903, superintended by trained expert officers from the mills of New England.

A subscription guaranteeing $20 per month was raised for a teacher's salary, and the school was opened in 1832. Three years later, Malvin, who had proved himself an indefatigable worker, was instrumental in securing a convention at Columbus of the colored people of the state to devise some way of increasing the means to educate their people. The outcome of the convention was the organization of the School Fund Society, whose object was the establishment and maintenance of colored schools., 1256920=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Kansas City Embalming and Casket Co., 1014 North Fifth street, Kansas City, Kan.--A corporation.

Herself a fugitive slave, she devoted her life after her own freedom was won, to the work of aiding others to escape. First and last Harriet brought out several thousand slaves. John Brown always called her \"General,\" and once introduced her to Wendell Phillips by saying, \"I bring you one of the best and bravest persons on this continent--General Tubman, as we call her.\" William Lambert, who died in Detroit a few years since, being very nearly one hundred years old, was another of those of the race who devoted themselves to the work for which John Brown hoped to strike a culminating blow. Between 1829 and 1862-- thirty-three years--William is reported to have aided in the escape of 30,000 slaves. He lived in Detroit, and was one of the foremost representatives of his people in both Michigan and Ontario. Underground Railroad operations culminating chiefly at Cleveland, Sandusky and Detroit, led by broad and defined routes through Ohio to the border of Kentucky. Through that state in the heart of the Cumberland mountains, northern Georgia, east Tennessee and northern Alabama, the limestone eaves of the region served a useful purpose. And it is a fact that the colored people living in Ohio were often bolder and more determined than was the rule elsewhere. The Ohio-Kentucky routes probably served more fugitives than others in the North. The valley of the Mississippi was the most westerly channel until Kansas opened a bolder way of escape from the Southwest slave section. John Brown knew whatever was to be known of all this unrest, and he also must have known of the secret organization which George B. Gill mentions in his interesting paper. This organization served a purpose of some value to the government in the earlier parts of the Civil War, a fact that lies within my own knowledge, and then fell into disuse as the hours moved swifter to the one in which the gateway of the Union swung aside, and the pathway of the law opened, to allow the colored American to reach emancipation and citizenship., 132117=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then came another change of jurisdiction. On March 11, 1865, General Stephen A. Hurlbut at New Orleans assumed the charge of freedmen and labor for the state of Louisana. He based his orders on the failure of the secretary of the treasury to recognize the regulations of that secretary's own general agent, Mr. Mellen. Mr. Thomas W. Conway was announced as \"Superintendent of Home Colonies,\" the word having a larger extension than before. A registry of plantations, hire and compensation of labor, with a fair schedule of wages, penalties for idleness and crime, time and perquisites of labor, the poll tax of $2 per year, liens and security for work done, were carefully provided for by General Hurlbut's specific instructions., 1228862=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1901 the city council passed an ordinance giving the conductors of the street railway the right to assign and reassign passengers to seats in the cars. This ordinance was looked upon by many to be worse than a direct separate car, for the reason the conductors could seat you in a seat in the car and if he wanted that seat for a white person, could make you get up with your wife and your girl and compel you to take another. He was also given police power to arrest you. This act brought about a strike. Our people, almost to a man, stopped riding on the cars. Our leaders met at St. Paul A. M. E. Church in that city at a called meeting, and passed resolutions to start a company, to purchase automobile carriages. I was asked by a friend or two to go to this meeting. This I refused to do. I thought this to be my time to go to the city council and ask for a franchise to build a colored park and street railway of our own to go to.

With what fidelity and ability he discharged the duties of this responsible post may be gathered from the following remarks of Mr. Latrobe, at the time the president of the Maryland Colonization Society. He was addressing the Board of Managers: \"None knew better,\" he said, \"or so well as the Board under what daily responsibilities Governor Russwurm's life in Africa was passed, and how conscientiously he discharged them; how, at periods when the very existence of the then infant colony depended upon its relations with surrounding tribes of excited natives, his coolness and admirable judgment obviated or averted impending perils; how, when the authority and dignity of the colonial government were at stake in lamentable controversies with civilized and angry white men, the calm decorum of his conduct brought even his opponents to his side; how, popular clamor among the colonists calling upon him as a judge to disregard the forms of law and sacrifice of offending individuals in the absence of legal proof, he rebuked the angry multitude by the stern integrity of his conduct; and how, when on his visit to Baltimore in 1848 be was thanked personally by the members of the board, he deprecated the praise bestowed upon him for the performance of his duty, and impressed all who saw him with the modest manliness of his character and his most excellent and courteous bearing.\" *, 195312=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Actual movement of immigrants began in 1879.

The cohesiveness of this organization in its secrecy and management being entirely committed to the plantation laborers and their direct representatives, has secured its potency. The representative political leader was neither intrusted with nor informed of its existence. Year by year since 1874 the organization, as encroachment after encroachment was made on the rights of the colored people, grew and strengthened, and now when reduced to virtual peonage and the threatened deprivation of all rights as freemen and citizens is imminent, the exodus has ensued and its consequences are manifest. *, 1208934=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We leased these mines for five years, paying a royalty for the land.

About the year 1890 the original survey of Mound Bayou was made, embracing about 20 acres, and a few years later the town was regularly incorporated, the charter being signed by Governor A. J. McLauren and Hon. Joseph F. Power, Secretary of State. At that time there was one fair country stow and two small business houses altogether, employing a capital of about $3,000 and doing an annual business of possibly $5,000. During a period of ten years, various additions have been made till the town now embraces about 75 acres, regularly laid out, having more than 1 1/2 miles of plank sidewalk, lighted with large oil and gasoline street lamps, a population of 400, many living in neat and cosy homes, surrounded by a neighboring population of over 2,500, largely occupying their own farms, ranging from 20 to 600 acres, comprising altogether 30,000 acres, over one-fourth of which is in cultivation, producing a variety of crops, mostly cotton, present average production of the latter about 3,500 bales., 34288=first a student is tempted to think that there has been no inner economic co-operation, or at least that it has only come to the fore in the last two or three decades. But this is not so. While to be sure the religious motive was uppermost during the time of slavery, for instance, so far as group action among the Negroes were concerned, even then it had an economic tinge, and more so since slavery, has Negro religion had its economic side; so, too, the political striving after the war was a matter even more largely of economic welfare than it was of political preferment so far as the great mass of the race was concerned. And then and now the strife for education is, if not primarily, certainly to a very large extent an effort at earning a living in some manner which will satisfy the higher cravings of the rising classes of Negroes. When, therefore, we take up under the head of economic co-operation such institutions as the church, such movements as the Exodus of 1879 and the matter of schools, etc., it is from the economic side that we are studying these things, and because this economic side was really of very great importance and significance., 234116=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This paper was looked upon by the slaveholders of the South and pro-slavery people of the North as a very dangerous document or sheet, and was watched with a critical eye. It could not be circulated in the slave-holding states by neither our ministers nor members. Hence its circulation was proscribed until the breaking out of the war in 1860, when through the aid of the Christian Commission it did valuable service to the freedmen throughout the South.

Of the amount held by Mr. Waring $2,000 belonged in equal parts to two white men, Messrs. Cooper and Singer. The bank did business satisfactorily for a short period. The first large deposit, a deposit of $100, was made by Mr. J. H. Murphy. After something less than a year the bank was compelled to close its doors. The failure was caused by the loaning of money on insufficient security. The loss to depositors and stockholders was insignificant. It is said Messrs.

Generals Butler and Banks, each in his turn, sought to provide for the thousands of destitute freedmen in medicines, rations and clothing. Colonies were soon formed and sent to abandoned plantations. A sort of general poor farm was established and called \"The Home Colony.\" Mr. Thomas W.

He appointed and located supervising special agents of his department in different portions of the South which were now free from Confederate troops. These agents had charge of the freedmen. Each was to form here and there settlements on abandoned estates, each dominated a \"Freedman's Home Colony,\" and situated in his own district, and he must appoint a supervisor for such colonies as he should establish. A number of such colonies were formed.

William Washington Browne, an ex-slave of Habersham county, Ga., as a fraternal beneficiary institution, composed of male and female. members, and began with 100 members and a capital of $150. On April 4,1883, or over two years later, the circuit court of the city of Richmond, Va., granted a regular charter of incorporation as a joint stock company to Browne and his associates under the name of \"The Grand Fountain of the United Order of True Reformers.\" The chief purpose of incorporation was to provide what is to be known as an endowment or mutual benefit fund; the capital stock was \"to be not less than $100 nor more than $10,000, to be divided into shares of the value of $5 each;\" the company was to hold real estate \"not to exceed in value the sum of $25,000;\" the principal office was to be kept in the city of Richmond, and officers named in the charter for the year were Rev. William W. Browne, Richmond, Va., Grand Worthy Master; Eliza Allen, Petersburg, Va., Grand Worthy Mistress; R. T. Quarles, Ashland, Va., Grand Worthy Vice-Master; S.W. Sutton, Richmond, Va., Grand Worthy Chaplain; Peter H. Woolfolk, Richmond, Va., Grand Worthy Secretary; Robert I. Clarke, Centralia, Va., Grand Worthy Treasurer. These, with six others, composed the Board of Directors for the first year. Thus the True Reformers started on their way as a full-fledged joint stock corporation, whose chief aim was to provide a form of what is known as mutual beneficial insurance for its members. In 1898 the charter was amended so that a part of section 2 should read as follows: \"The said corporation shall issue certificates of membership to its members and shall pay death benefits to the heirs, assigns, personal or legal representatives of the deceased members;\" and section 4, as follows: \"The real estate to be held shall not exceed in value the sum of five hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars.\", 1293541=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colorado Mercantile Co., Colorado Springs, Col.--Forty-three members; arranges short loans.

These enactments simply caused the Afro-American companies to hustle more and they paid the taxes. These legislators met again; passed a law to this effect. In order for insurance companies paying sick and death claims to continue to do business they must deposit in the state treasury the round sum of $10,000 as a security to their policy holders. Many thought that Virginia would be a grave yard for Afro-American insurance companies. White agents on their route told Afro-Americans holding policies in Afro-American companies, that their moneys were lost and they had better join the white companies. The Virginia Beneficial and Insurance Co, and three other Afro-American companies individually put up their $10,000 and today there are more Afro-American insurance companies, with home offices in the state, doing business than there are white. *, 328678=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Arnett's Budgett, 1904, p. 95., 1215870=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Dixie Industrial Company was incorporated under the laws of Alabama in 1900, with a capital of $10,000, and secured its first tract of 5,000 acres of land with a few dilapidated cabins.

A general oversight of the proceedings was maintained by our officers in charge, who confirmed or modified the findings of the court. The shrewdness of the colored judges was very remarkable, though it was sometimes necessary to decrease the severity of the punishments they proposed. Fines and penal service on the Home Farm were the usual sentences imposed. Petty theft and idleness were the most frequent causes of trouble, but my officers were able to report that exposed property was as safe on Davis Bend as it would be anywhere.

With the expansion of the lessee system, private interests were allowed to displace the interests of the Negroes whom we had established there under the protection of the government, but orders issued by General N. J. T. Dana, upon whose sympathetic and intelligent co-operation my officers could always rely, restored to us the full control of these lands.

This experiment was continued from time to time during the next ten years in Cincinnati. In September, 1832, a small Sunday school was gathered, which in three years numbered 125 scholars. In their zeal for improvement, a lyceum also was organized, where three times a week practical talks were given on different literary and scientific subjects, and often an attendance of 300 would gather for instruction. A circulating library of 100 volumes was also collected, but owing to the inability of so many to read and write, it was of little use save for its value as an inspiration. In March, 1832 an effort was again made for a school. A suitable room was rented from a colored man and a teacher secured. The clamor of the adults to gain admittance became so great that night schools were opened for two evenings a week, the number of teachers necessary being obtained from Lane Theological Seminary from among the young men preparing for the ministry.

No sooner, however, did they appear in the Church than discrimination began to be practiced which the free Negroes of the North refused to accept. They, therefore, withdrew into the African Methodist and Zion Methodist Churches. The Baptists even among the slaves early had their separate churches, and these churches in the North began to federate about 1836. In 1871 the Methodist Church, South, set aside their colored members into the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, and the other Southern churches drove their members into the other colored churches. The remaining Northern denominations. retained their Negro members, but organized them for the most part into separate congregations., 1301219=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Organized in 1902 by a man who had previously organized two in Wilmington, N.

Association is composed exclusively of Negro stockholders, except two white men, who are experienced bookkeepers and accountants, and who serve upon our finance committee. This association has lent to its stockholders for the purchase of homes, etc., nearly $12,000. It is earning larger profits per share than any other organization of its kind in the State. It proposes to establish a bank in Greensboro as soon as the proposed one now under consideration in Winston is finally finished or disposed of; that is, as soon as the permanent organization has been well perfected., 888561=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*The only secret organization in Arkansas of national repute, which has its origin in the State, is the Mosaic Templars of America. It was conceived and had its birth from the fertile brain of two Negroes, C. W. Keatts and J. E. Bush, in 1882, in the city of Little Rock. Today this organization is known in nearly every Southern State in the Union and numbers its members by the thousands. They have expended in cash for the relief of the widows, orphans of deceased members in the past twenty years, $175,000: paid to its policy-holders $51,009, and at their last session in Shreveport, La., July 25, 1902, reported a property valuation of $225,000.--National Negro Business League, 1902, p. 105., 4337=Source Description: (title page) Economic Co-operation among Negro Americans.

It may be added that the number of active members had been reduced to ten because certain ones did not have sufficient funds to put in. It happened about this time that a very desirable tract of land was offered for sale for debt. This tract contained 40 acres of frontage along the public highway, and had a house which though antiquated was serviceable. The titles were investigated and by the middle of December the transaction was closed. The amount charged for the place was $350. The bond for title was secured for $100 and the other amounts were to be made in three payments with legal interest. Three years were given in which to pay this money, but these energetic farmers succeeded in paying the entire debt in two years. For the second payment, December, 1901, $112.50 was raised and last of all $167, with which the deed was taken up. In addition to this last amount, enough money was raised to take up, the following January, another place which adjoined the one previously purchased. *, 745856=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The city of Philadelphia, in 1906 had 19 lodges, with 1,167 members; 75 members received sick benefits, 7 death benefits, 8 widows were relieved and 6 widows and orphans buried., 1067234=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We began business November 8,1905, with $1,000 paid in.

There was hardly a spare inch of earth's surface unoccupied by vigorous roots, driven forth by the wonderful power of the virgin soil. We had to grub a small spot in the front yard to form a safe playground for the children., 523872=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The history of these societies is interesting. The Christian Progress is the oldest of them. It was organized soon after the close of the war by a number of Christian people who banded themselves together for mutual help. The society has twenty-five members and the monthly dues per person are 25 cents. The sick benefit is 50 cents per week. The society pays one-half of the doctor's bill. The death benefit is $27. Any person of good moral character may now become a member. The next oldest society dates its organization from reconstruction days, when there was a military company here with a woman's auxiliary. The company passed out of existence but the auxiliary, under the name of the Ladies' Branch, has continued to the present time. This society owns a hall, where its meetings are held. Its membership is fifty and its monthly dues 25 cents per member. The sick benefit is 50 cents per week and the death benefit is $25. When a member dies an assessment of 25 cents is levied on the survivors. The Boyer Quiet Club was organized in 1888 at the suggestion of an old German named Boyer who, although very poor, attempted to help the poorer Negroes. The society charges an admission fee of $3. It has about fifty members, with monthly dues of 25 cents. The sick benefits are 50 cents per week and one-half the cost of the doctor's first visit. The society pays all the funeral expenses. The Earnest Workers has been organized five years. It has forty-five members with the usual monthly dues. The sick benefits are 50 cents per week and the cost of the physician's first visit. The death benefits are $20 and one-half of the funeral expenses; it reported $100 in the treasury. The E. K. Love Benevolent Society, with headquarters in Savannah, is chartered, the Warsaw branch having sixty members. This society has a twofold purpose: to aid the sick and bury the dead, and to assist in supporting the Central City College at Macon, Ga., an institution controlled and supported by colored Baptists of the state. Each member of the society is taxed 60 cents a year for the support of the college. For local purposes the members are taxed 25 cents per month. The sick benefit is $1 per week. When a member dies $30 is paid on the funeral expenses and $10 to the nearest relative. Only Christians are eligible for membership in the society. The Sons and Daughters of Zion is primarily a children's society. It has twenty-seven members and the monthly dues are 15 cents per month. The sick benefits are 50 cents per week and one-half the doctor's bill. The death benefit is $20. It reported $113 in the treasury. *, 1065902=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*National Negro Business League, 1906, pp. 168-9., 141562=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1864, July 5, Eaton reports:, 205400=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On Wednesday evening, December 3, 1879, a meeting was held in the lecture room of the Second Baptist Church to organize a relief society to care for the colored emigrants, as we learned that some of them were on their way here from North Carolina, and that, they would arrive here destitute.

He had risen from abject poverty to wealth and respectability, and was largely engaged in navigation. He believed that only in Africa could his people find civil and religious liberty. At a cost to himself of four thousand dollars, and in his own vessel, he took out from Boston a colony of thirty-eight persons, which landed at Sierra Leone, and might have resulted in something permanent and valuable but for the death of Cuffe in the following year, and the exclusion of American vessels from British colonies. The next year the Colonization Society began its work. The first important movement of the Colonization Society was to send out, on borrowed money, Samuel J. Mills and Ebenezer Burgess to select a suitable site for a colony. They sailed November 16, 1817, and arrived the 22d of the following March. They passed down the coast some one hundred and twenty miles to the island Sherbro, at the mouth of a river of the same name. Here they found a small but prosperous colony under the direction of John Kizzel, who had built a church on the island and was preaching to the people. Kizzel had been carried from Africa when a child and sold as a slave in South Carolina, but had joined the British during the Revolutionary war, and at its close had sailed from Nova Scotia with a company of colored people to reside in Africa. *, 131602=Negroes were contented and grateful and were able to lay by small gains. This plantation arrangement along the Mississippi under the commissioners as well as the management of numerous infirmary camps passed, about the close of 1863, from the war to the treasury department.

From this beginning, with small additions from foreign countries, sprang the Masonry among the Negroes in America. These fifteen brethren were, according to a custom of the day, authorized to assemble as a lodge, \"walk on St. John's Day\" and bury their dead \"in manner and form;\" but they did no \"work\"--made no Masons--until after they had been regularly warranted. They applied to the Grand Lodge of England for a warrant March 2, 1784. It was issued to them as \"African Lodge, No. 459,\" with Prince Hall as Master, September 29, 1784, but--owing to various vexatious misadventures--was not received until April 29, 1787.

A committee was appointed and founded Union Seminary. Later this institution was united with Wilberforce University, which was bought by the church from the white Methodist Church. Thus Wilberforce, dating from 1856, is the oldest Negro institution in the land. The church has now about twenty-five schools in all. They are supported from three sources: 1. Tuition, etc., paid by students; 2. Donations and bequests; 3. Appropriations from the general fund of the church. From these sources about $275,000 was raised in the four years, 1896-1900; and since 1884, when the General Educational Department was organized, there has been raised $1,250,000 for education.

I enlisted in the regular army, and then I went back after I had come out of the army. After we had come out a parcel of we men that was in the army and other men thought that the way our people had been treated during the time that we were in service--we heard so much talk of how they had been treated and oppressed so much and there was no help for it--that caused me to go into the army at first, the way our people was opposed. There was so much going on that I went off and left it; when I came back it was still going on, part of it, not quite so bad as at first. So a parcel of us got together and said that we would organize ourselves into a committee and look into affairs and see the true condition of our race, to see whether it was possible we could stay under a people who had held us under bondage or not. Then we did so and organized a committee. Some of the members of the committee was ordered by the committee to go into every state in the South where we had been slaves there, and post one another from time to time about the true condition of our race, and nothing but the truth., 201055=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was signed by 168 Negroes.

We were chartered by Governor Vardaman, who, not so much because of kindly feelings towards the members of our race, but mainly because of the indomitable perseverance of the Mississippi Negro, has been forced to sign more charters for Negro banks than any other man in the world, living or dead. Located in a town and surrounded by a community whose citizenry is composed almost exclusively of our people, our bank has had a splendid opportunity to indicate the Negro's capacity to operate a financial institution among themselves. Starting without any experience, no correspondents or financial connections, in a one-story frame building, 16x20, it has today about $40,000 in resources and liabilities; correspondents and financial connections in Clarksdale, Miss., Memphis, New Orleans and New York. In sending some of our paper to New York this spring for discount to our New York correspondent, the Cashier replied that be had placed the amount to our credit at 5 per cent per annum and assured us that it was a pleasure to serve us.

The king once in every forty days, at the Adai custom, distributed among a number of chiefs various sums of gold dust with a charge to turn the same to good account. These chiefs then sent down to the coast caravans of tradesmen, some of whom would be their slaves, sometimes some two to three hundred strong, to barter ivory for European goods, or buy such goods with gold dust, which the king obtained from the royal alluvial workings. Down to 1873 a constant stream of Ashanti traders might be seen daily wending their way to the coast and back again, yielding more certain wealth and prosperity to the merchants of the Gold Coast and Great Britain than may be expected for, sometime yet to come from the mining industry and railway development put together. The trade chiefs would, in due time, render a faithful account to the king's stewards, being allowed to retain a fair portion of the profit. In the king's household, too, he would have special men who directly traded for him. Important chiefs carried on the same system of trading with the coast as did the king. Thus every member of the state from the king downwards, took an active interest in the promotion of trade and in the keeping open of trade routes into the interior., 181054=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question of emigration to Canada West, after an exhaustive discussion which continued during the two days of the convention's sessions, was recommended as a measure of relief against the persecution from which the colored American suffered in many places in the North. Strong resolutions against the American Colonization Society were adopted. The formation of a parent society with auxiliaries in the different localities represented in the convention, for the purpose of raising money to defray the object of purchasing a colony in the province of upper Canada, and ascertain more definite information, having been effected, the convention adjourned to reassemble on the first Monday in June, 1831, during which time the order of the convention respecting the organization of the auxiliary societies had been carried into operation. *, 188122=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Simultaneously the movement arose in several states.

In addition to this cash expenditure the subsistence, medical supplies, quartermaster stores, issued to the refugees and freedmen prior to July 1, 1866, were furnished by the commissionary, medical and quartermaster's department, and accounted for in the current expenses of those departments; they were not charged to nor paid for by my officers. They amounted to two million three hundred and thirty thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight dollars and seventy-two cents ($2,330,788.72) in original cost; but a large portion of these stores being damaged and condemned as unfit for issue to troops, their real value to the Government was probably less than, 491484=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the past the Negroes have undoubtedly contributed a considerably larger proportion than this. For instance, in Delaware, Maryland and Kentucky, they contributed more than the total cost of their schools for several years. In all the other states the tendency has been to use first indirect taxation for schools and then to add direct taxation until today a large proportion of the taxes are direct. Now the indirect taxation fell more largely on the Negroes than the direct, since they are renters and consumers rather than landowners. If Georgia be taken as a typical state in this respect, then the conclusion of the Conference, held last May, is true, viz: That in the years 1870 to 1899 the Negro school systems of the former slave states have not cost the white taxpayers a cent, except possibly in a few city systems:, 1039398=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Alabama Savings Bank was organized August, 1890. One of the considerations which led to the effort of building a bank was that it might serve as a remedy for the squandering of property in our district. During my pastorate in Birmingham there was a family who had two children. Both of the parents died, and the property left to the children was squandered. The estate was estimated at $10,000. The administrator sold the boy, the elder of the two, old horses and carriages in payment for his interest in the estate. To make a bond of $20,000, as was necessary in this case, was impossible for any colored person to do. When I saw our helplessness in the effort to help orphan children in saving the property earned by their parents, I conceived the idea if we had a strong financial institution that could make bonds and save the property left to the heirs for their benefit, it would greatly help the race., 596352=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a021.

The first day we did only $500 of business, but we are glad to say that we averaged for the first year over $50,000, and still better last year. This year we mean to do even more. The future for our enterprise is indeed bright, and we believe our bank is destined to be one of the financial strongholds of our people of this section. We are in a vicinity of activity. And we are endeavoring to get the people to save systematically, which means a business that can be depended upon.

The usual irregular host of slaves then swarmed in from the surrounding country. They begged for protection against recapture, and they, of course, needed food, clothing and shelter. They could not now be re-enslaved through army aid, yet no provision had been made by anybody for their sustenance. A few were employed as teamsters, servants, cooks and pioneers, yet it seemed as though the vast majority must be left to freeze and starve; for when the storms came with the winter months the weather was of great severity., 119870=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0June 28,1862, Brigadier General Rufus Saxton, with headquarters at Beaufort, South Carolina, assumed the government and control of all places and persons in the Department of the South which were not embraced in the operations of General Quincy A. Gilmore, commanding the department. General Saxton, as military governor, appointed three division superintendents, each having charge of several of the Sea Islands. Market houses were established at Hilton Head and Beaufort for the sale of the produce from the plantations, and Negroes put to work, the larger settlement being Port Royal Island and near the town of Beaufort., 527096=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From early times the precarious economic condition of the free Negroes led to many mutual aid organizations. They were very simple inform: an initiation fee of small amount was required and small regular payments; in case of sickness, a weekly stipend was paid, and in case of death the members were assessed to pay for the funeral and help the widow. Confined to a few members, all personally known to each other, such societies were successful from the beginning. We hear of them in the eighteenth century, and by 1838 there were 100 such small groups, with 7,448 members, in the city. They paid in $18,851, gave $14,172 in benefits, and had $10,023 on hand. Ten years later about 8,000 members belonged to 106 such societies. Seventy-six of these had a total membership of 5,187. They contributed usually 25 cents to 37 1/2 cents a month; the sick received $150 to $300 per week, and death benefits of $10 to $20 were allowed. The income of these seventy-six societies was $16,81423; 681 families were assisted. These societies have since been superceded to some extent by, 102650=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On leaving Boston, March 8th, he [i. e., John Brown] carried with him $500 in gold and assurance of other support. He passed through New York on the 2d, preferring to go around rather than take the risk of being recognized in western Massachusetts. On the 10th of March Frederick Douglass, Henry Highland Garnett of New York, Stephen Smith and William Still of Philadelphia, [all colored] with John Brown, Jr., met the captain in conference at the dwelling of either Smith or Still. Of course the object of these was to find out the Underground Railroad routes and stations, to ascertain the persons who were actually to be relied upon, places to stop at, means of conveyance, and especially to learn of the colored men who could be trusted. The Philadelphia conference must have gone over this ground with the two Browns, and the experience of those who were the most active of Underground Railroad directors in that section, could not but have been useful. . . . . . John Brown's purpose in calling and holding the convention at Chatham, Canada West, was in harmony with the conception and plans he had evolved. There was a large number of colored residents under the British flag. They were mainly fugitive slaves, among whom were many bold, even daring men. In the section of which Chatham was one of the centers, considerable direction had been given to the settlement of these people. There were among them (and still are) a good many farmers, mechanics, storekeepers, as well as laborers. It would not be correct to say that no prejudice existed against them, but it was not strong enough, as in the land from which they fled, to prevent industry and sobriety from having a fair chance, while intelligence, well directed, made its way to civic and business recognition. There were probably not less than 75,000 fugitive residents in Canada West at the time of the Chatham gathering. Their presence, well-ordered lives and fair degree of prosperity, had brought also to live with them as doctors, clergymen, teachers, lawyers, printers, surveyors, etc., educated freemen of their own race. Martin Delany, a physician, editor, ethnologist and naturalist, was one of them. Mr. Holden, a well-trained surveyor and civil engineer, at whose residence in Chatham John Brown stayed, the Rev. William Charles Munroe, Osborne Perry Anderson and others, were among these helpers. But it was not simply the presence of these forces which took John Brown to Chatham. As one may naturally understand, looking at conditions then existing, there existed something of an organization to assist fugitives and for resistance to their masters. It was found all along the borders from Syracuse, New York, to Detroit, Michigan. As none but colored men were admitted into direct and active membership with this \"League of Freedom,\" it is quite difficult to trace its workings or know how far its ramifications extended. One of the most interesting phases of slave life, so far as the whites were enabled to see or impinge upon it, was the extent and rapidity of communication among them. Four geographical lines seem to have been chiefly followed. One was that of the coast south of the Potomac, whose almost continuous line of swamps from the vicinity of Norfolk, Va., to the northern border of Florida afforded a refuge for many who could not escape and became \"marooned\" in their depths, while giving facility to the more enduring to work their way out to the North Star Land. The great Appalachian range and its abutting mountains were long a rugged, lonely, but comparatively safe route to freedom. It was used, too, for many years. Doubtless a knowledge of that fact, for John Brown was always an active Underground Railroad man, had very much to do, apart from its immediate use strategically considered, with the captain's decision to begin operations therein. Harriet Tubman, whom John Brown met for the first time at St. Catherine's in March or April, 1858, was a constant user of the Appalachian, 1254290=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Savannah Pharmacy, Savannah, Ga.--Five members.

W. Cox, of Indianola, Miss., I beg to advise that no man of color is as highly regarded and respected by the white people of his town and county as he. It is true that he organized and is cashier of the Delta Penny Savings Bank, domiciled there. I visited Indianola during the spring of 1905 and was very much surprised to note the esteem in which he was held by the bankers and businessmen (white) of that place. He is a good, clean man and above the average in intelligence, and knows how to handle the typical Southern white man. In the last statement furnished by his bank to the State Auditor, his bank showed total resources of $46,000. He owns and lives in one of the best resident houses in Indianola, regardless of race, and located in a part of the town where other colored men seem to be not desired.\", 92861=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the beginning of the nineteenth century slaves began to escape in considerable numbers from the region south of Mason and Dixon's line and the Ohio to the North. Even here, however, they were not safe from the fugitive slave laws, and soon after 1812 the Negro soldiers and sailors discovered a surer refuge in Canada and the tide set thither. Gradually between 1830 and 1850 there were signs of definite concerted co-operation to assist fugitives which came to be known as the Underground Railroad. The organization is best known from the side of the white abolitionists who aided and sheltered the fugitives and furnished them means., 474924=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From this it is clear that primary and grammar schools for Negroes are being supported very largely by Negroes themselves--nearly all the institutions whose students pay 50 per cent or more of the cost in cash being really schools of this character. The schools for higher training collect a smaller proportion of cash from their students, and the industrial schools the smallest proportion. But the latter schools receive a very large payment in work from students., 883522=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Organized 1899., 1238104=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The People's Mercantile Association of Washington, D.

Dr. Delaney was given a commission to go to Africa, in the Niger Valley, Whitfield to go to Central America, and Holly to Hayti, to enter into negotiations with the authorities of these various countries for Negro emigrants and to report to future conventions. Holly was the first to execute his mission, going down to Hayti in 1855, when he entered into relations with the Minister of the Interior, the father of the late President Hyppolite, and by him was presented to Emperor Faustin I. The next emigration convention was held at Chatham, Canada West, in 1856, when the report on Hayti was made. Dr. Delaney went off on his mission to the Niger Valley, Africa, via England in 1858. There he concluded a treaty signed by himself and eight kings, offering inducements for Negro emigrants to their territories. Whitfield went to California, intending to go later from thence to Central America, but died in San Francisco before he could do so. Meanwhile (James) Redpath went to Hayti as a John Brownist after the Harper's Ferry raid, and reaped the first fruits of Holly's mission by being appointed Haytian Commissioner of Emigration in the United States by the Haytian Government, but with the express injunction that Rev. Holly should be called to co-operate with him. On Redpath's arrival in the United States, he tendered Rev. Holly a commission from the Haytian Government at $1,000 per annum and traveling expenses to engage emigrants to go to Hayti.

The funds of the Society were not as large as the nature and scope of the work demanded. Emigrants went slowly, not averaging more than 170 per annum--only 1,232 in ten years: but the average from the first of January, 1848, to the last of December, 1852, was 540 yearly; and, in the single year of 1853, 782 emigrants arrived at Monrovia.

C., opened in 1888. Before that, however, a bank had been especially established for the freedmen:, 245686=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The total income for the one year, 1884, was:, 132946=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General Edward R. S. Canby, a little later, from Mobile, Ala., issued similar orders, and Mr. Conway was also placed over the freedmen's interests in his vicinity. Thus the whole freedmen's management for Alabama, Southern Mississippi and Louisiana was concentrated under Mr. Conway's control. He reported early in 1865 that there were about twenty colored regiments in Louisiana under pay and that they could purchase every inch of confiscated and abandoned lands in the bands of the government in that state. All the soldiers desired to have the land on the expiration of enlistment. One regiment had in hand $50,000 for the purpose of buying five of the largest plantations on the Mississippi. It was at the time thought by many persons interested in the future of the freedmen that the abandoned and confiscated lands if used for them would afford a wholesome solution to the Negro problem. . . . ., 484227=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To overcome these poor conditions, and to provide reasonably ample opportunities for effective training, the Negroes are working in several different directions. They are not only supplementing the public funds and lengthening the school term, but are establishing private schools and consolidating with the public schools nearby; they are building independent private schools; and they are supporting in larger measure the great schools established by Northern philanthropy. One of the most conspicuous cases of consolidating with the public school is furnished by the Keyesville Industrial School in Charlotte county. This is an industrial school, founded in 1898 and supported almost entirely by Negroes, through the Baptist organizations of that neighborhood. They have a plant, including 100 acres of land, worth $2,600. They have domitory accommodations for 30 boarding students and a daily attendance of 135 pupils. The curriculum includes such instruction as will fit a pupil to enter Virginia Union University, with which school it is affiliated, and such manual and industrial training as will fit them for useful lives and for trade schools like Hampton. This school succeeded in having the publc school and the public funds placed in its bands. It gets only the $175 formerly given by the county to the public school, but it gives the children a term of seven instead of five months, and it pays two well-trained teachers of its own appointing $20 each and board per mouth instead of $15 and $20, respectively, without board, as was the case formerly. The children are better housed and better taught and maintain higher attendance than was known before, to say nothing of having the benefit of effective manual training. This is made possible by the contributions of Negroes to this school. It is a positive effort on the part of the Negroes thereabout (70,000 within a radius of 75 miles) to improve their educational facilities. Through the Baptist Associations, Sunday school contributions, churches, tuition and board from pupils, this community pays into the school nearly $2,000 yearly. The only support of any magnitude received from outside is $200 annually from the Baptist Home Mission Society. Keyesville Institute is but one of a group of half a dozen schools of its kind scattered around in the counties of Virginia., 125536=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The secretary of the treasury, Salmon P. Chase, always anxious for successful emancipation, had had brought to his attention early in 1862 the accumulations of the best cotton on abandoned sea island plantations; there was the opportunity to raise more, and the many slaves in the vicinity practically set free and under governmental control could be worked to advantage. The cotton was to be collected by treasury agents and the freedmen benefited., 377048=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church had these institutions in 1901.

In the eastern Soudan and among the great Bantu tribes extending from the Soudan down toward the south, cattle are evidences of wealth, one tribe, for instance, having so many oxen that each village had ten or twelve thousand head. Lenz (1884), Bouet-Willaumez (1848), Hecquard (1854), Bosman (1805), and Baker (1868), all bear witness to this, and Schweinfurth (1878), tells us of great cattle parks with 2,000-3,000 head, and of numerous agricultural and cattle raising tribes. Von der Decken (1859-61), describes the paradise of the dwellers about Kilimanjaro--the bananas, fruit, beans, and peas, and cattle raising with stall-feed, the fertilizing of the fields, and irrigation. The Negroid Gallas have seven or eight cattle to each inhabitant. Cameron (1877), tells of villages so clean, with huts so artistic, that--save in book knowledge--the people occupied no low plane of civilization.

The teacher was one Elisha Sylvester, whose salary was paid by the parents of the children whom he taught, In 1800 sixty-six colored citizens presented a petition to the school committee of Boston, praying that a school might be established for their benefit. A sub-committee to whom the petition had been referred, reported in favor of granting the prayer, but it was voted down at the next town meeting. However the school taught by Mr. Sylvester did not perish. Two young gentlemen from Harvard University, Messrs. Brown and Williams, continued the school until 1806. During this year the colored Baptists built a church edifice in Belknap street, and fitted up the lower room for a school for colored children. From the house of Primus Hall the little school, was moved to its new quarters in the Belknap Street Church. Here it was continued until 1835, when a school house was erected and paid for out of a fund left for the purpose by Abiel Smith, and was subsequently called \"Smith School House.\" The authorities of Boston were induced to give $200 as an annual appropriation, and the parents of the children in attendance paid 12 1/2 cents per week.

To the oft-repeated slander that the Negroes will not work, and are incapable of taking care of themselves, it is a sufficient answer that their voluntary labor has produced nearly all the food that supported the whole people, besides a large amount of rice, sugar and tobacco for export, and two millions of bales of cotton each year, on which was paid into the United States treasury during the years 1866 and 1867 a tax of more than forty millions of dollars ($40,000,000). It is not claimed that this result is wholly due to the care and oversight of this Bureau, but it is safe to say, as it has been said repeatedly by intelligent Southern white men, that without the Bureau or some similar agency, the material interests of the country would have greatly suffered, and the Government would have lost a far greater amount than has been expended in its maintenance . . . . . ., 109235=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Alexander Milton Ross, in a letter January 21st, 1893, says:*, 1070998=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Negro National Business League, 1906, p. 190., 1118574=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are lending money to the Negro men of the city; we are securing them credit and accommodation with wholesale houses which they never enjoyed before. We are redeeming homes for many Negroes who, in a measure, had lost them. At the close of 1905 the entire loss of the first year had been covered, and a dividend of 4 1/2 per cent declared. Our growth has not been anything like phenomenal, but steady and firm. At the close of business, in 1903, our deposits were $12,000; 1904, $20,000; 1905, $27,000; July 31, 1906, $45,000., 246943=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The income for 1900 is thus reckoned up by the church statistician:, 192950=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fiat to go forth is irresistible. The constantly recurring, nay, ever present, fear which haunts the minds of these our people in the turbulent parishes of the state is, that slavery in the horrible form of peonage is approaching; that the avowed disposition of the men now in power is to reduce the laborer and his interest to the minimum of advantages as freemen and to absolutely none as citizens, has produced so absolute a fear that in many cases it has become a panic. It is flight from present sufferings and from the wrongs to come. The committee finds that this exodus owes its effectiveness to society organizations among plantation laborers; that it began with the persecutions and the political mobs of the years 1874 and 1876, and was organized as a colonization council in August, 1874, for emigration. This organization beginning in Caddo Parish, spread rapidly from parish to parish until it had permeated the state, and in sections particularly known as the cotton belt, where lawlessness and outrages upon black persons are most frequent, the society has been most active., 1243176=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0J.

We are beginning to see that the Africans, notwithstanding the fact that they have not reached European culture, nevertheless have made great advances. In 1885 Dr. Wilhelm Schneider summed up the cultural accomplishments of the Negro by bringing together the testimonies of African travellers up to that time. If we take from that excellent summing up the condition of the African in economic organization we shall have a fairly trustworthy picture. Schneider first takes up the matter of agriculture, and says that the Negro pursues agriculture together with cattle raising and dairying. Sheep, goats and chickens are domestic animals all over Africa, and cows are raised in regions where grass grows. Von Franzius considers Africa the home of the house cattle and the Negro as the original tamer., 170793=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As early as 1788 the Negro Union of Newport, R. I., wrote to the free African Society of Philadelphia proposing a general exodus of Negroes to Africa. To this the Free African Society soberly replied: \"With regard to the immigration to Africa you mention, we have at present but little to communicate on that head, apprehending every pious man is a good citizen of the whole world.\" But the desire to better their condition by going to some other country had taken root, among the best New England Negroes. The Cuffes, for instance, John and Paul, petitioned for the right to vote in 1780, and in 1815 we find that Paul Cuffe, the younger, who was a merchant between America, and Africa, had started to take a colony to Africa, Thus an early attempt at African colonization by a baud of New England Negroes started the year before the American Colonization Society was organized:, 1296802=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another series of associations in East Baltimore, in 1868, had 100 members and probably facilitated the purchase of forty or fifty houses., 232557=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Arnett's Budgett, 1900, p. 139., 208660=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the month of February, 1880, John M.

Harry, to whom I referred in my second report as \"my faithful guide and attendant, who had done for me more service than any white man could render,\" with funds of his own and some borrowed money, bought at the recent tax sales a small farm of three hundred and thirteen acres for three hundred and five dollars.

I rode through his farm on the tenth of April, my last day in the territory, and one-third of his crop was then in. . . . . . Harry lives in the house of the former overseer, and delights, though not boastingly, in his position as a landed proprietor. He has promised to write me, or rather to dictate a letter, giving an account of the progress of his crop.

The convent originated with the French Dominican refugees, who came to Baltimore during the uprising in the West Indies. The sisters were colored. Another school, established in 1835, gave instruction to free colored children. In North Carolina there were before 1835 several schools maintained by the free Negroes. They had usually white teachers. After 1835 the few clandestine schools were taught by Negroes. In Charleston, S.C., there was a school for Negroes opened in 1744, which lasted some ten years.

Harwood published a very interesting paper on Secret Societies in America, white and colored, in which he gives total membership, money raised, and disbursements for charity. In his table the number of colored Masons is given as 224,000. This is excessive. The Encyclop\u00e6dia of Fraternities, published in 1899, states the number as 55,713., 177577=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0John Brown Russwurm was born in 1799 at Port Antonio in the island of Jamaica of a Creole mother. When 8 years old he was put at school in Quebec. His father meanwhile came to the United States and married in the District of Maine. Mrs. Russwurm, true wife that she was, on learning the relationship, insisted that John Brown (as hitherto he had been called) should be sent for and should thenceforth be one of the family. Through his own exertions, with some help from others, he was at length enabled to enter college and to complete the usual course. It should be remembered, to the credit of his fellow students in Brunswick, that peculiar as his position was among them, they were careful to avoid everything that might tend to make that position unpleasant. From college he went to New York and edited an abolition paper. This did not last long. He soon became interested in the colonization cause, and engaged in the service of the society. In 1829 he went to Africa as superintendent of public schools in Liberia, and engaged in mercantile pursuits in Monrovia. From 1830 to 1834 he acted as colonial secretary, superintending, 579552=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1887 the necessity for a repository for the funds of the organization was made very evident when at the organization of a subordinate Fountain in Charlotte county, Virginia, the funds collected were entrusted to a white store keeper by the treasurer for safe keeping. The white storekeeper passed the word amongst his neighbors, and it was determined by them to break up the organization. Feeling between the races was running very high because of a recent lynching in the neighborhood. This strange condition of affairs led to the organization of the savings bank. The Savings Bank of the Grand Fountain, United Order of True Reformers, was chartered by the Virginia Legislature March, 1888, and went into operation April 3,1889, receiving $1,200 on deposit the first day., 174154=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Colonization Society found many eminent Negroes to help them and Liberia was in its very foundation an example of Negro co-operation. One was Lott Carey, who was born a slave in Virginia, about 1780. His father was a Baptist.

Moriah, No. 1, was organized by residents of Louisville in 1850, under the jurisdiction of Ohio, and for three years met in New Albany, Ind., on account of the black laws, which forbade the assembling of free people of color. At the expiration of that time the lodge removed to Louisville, and shortly afterwards, while in open communication, their rooms were forcibly entered by the police, twenty-one of the brethren arrested, one of whom was Brother Gibson, the Secretary. On arriving at the prison, the jailers refused to receive them; the judge of the court who was consulted, ordered their discharge upon their personal promise to appear for trial the next morning. They went in a body for trial, found the court house guarded by the police, were denied admission, and told to go their ways, say nothing and they would not again be disturbed.

These movements were in some cases encouraged by the American Colonization Society, but in most cases the Negroes were suspicious of that organization, and the first efforts in the line of migration began among themselves. These efforts commenced as early as 1815, and lasted down to 1880. In the midst of them came the war and emancipation. Let us, therefore, first take up the economic cooperation consequent on emancipation and then the efforts toward migration., 191708=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We found ourselves in such condition that we looked around and we seed that there was no way on earth, it seemed, that we could better our condition there, and we discussed that thoroughly in our organization along in May. We said that the whole South--every state in the South--had got into the bands of the very men that held us slaves--from one thing to another--and we thought that the men that held us slaves was holding the reins of government over our heads in every respect almost, even the constable tip to the governor. We felt we had almost as well be slaves under these men. In regard to the whole matter that was discussed, it came up in every council. Then we said there was no hope for us and we had better go. . . . . . We had several organizations; there were many organizations; I can't tell you how many immigration associations, and so forth, all springing out of our colonization council. We had a large meeting, some five thousand people present, and made public speeches in 1877 on immigration., 479285=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Baptist associations of Northern Georgia, and the churches and individuals of half a dozen counties made Jeruel Academy a possibility.

Information was published through my officers and agents respecting the location and value of these lands, and the mode of procedure in order to obtain possession of them. Surveys were made and some assistance granted in transporting families to their new homes. Want of teams and farming implements, as well as opposition from their white neighbors, prevented many from taking the benefit of this homestead act; but about four thousand families have faced and overcome these obstacles, have acquired homes of their own and commenced work with energy, building houses and planting. In a few instances freedmen have combined their means and purchased farms already under cultivation. They have everywhere manifested a great desire to become landowners, a desire in the highest degree laudable and hopeful for their future civilization. Next to a proper religious and intellectual training, the one thing needful to the freedmen is land and a home. Without that a high degree of civilization and moral culture is scarcely possible. So long as he is merely one of a herd working for hire, and living on another's domain, he must be dependent and destitute of manly individuality and self-reliance. *, 85438=Given at London, under our hand and seal of Masonry, this 29th day of September, A.

No sooner, however, did they appear in the Church than discrimination began to be practiced which the free Negroes of the North refused to accept. They, therefore, withdrew into the African Methodist and Zion Methodist Churches.
