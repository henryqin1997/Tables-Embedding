    "textBeforeTable": "BP Roundtables I like the strikeouts, but he's going to have innings where he gives up homers and walks (he hasn't given up any of either). If he keeps the job though, it's not like 30 is some incredible number to reach. (Marc Normandin) Is Fernando Rodney on his way to 30+ saves? He's looked very good so far this year. Thanks Marc! (Steve from Detroit) 2009-04-16 13:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) I don't think so, but I do think that Jim Leyland did a lousy job of managing his pitching staff last night. Then again, when all you've got is one errant pitch from Brandon Lyon or Fernando Rodney standing between you and the offseason, then some of the blame also falls on the GM for not getting you the right parts. Having said that, I think the Tigers have done a fantastic job of handling Verlander and Porcello, getting a greater number of useful innings out of both at young ages without injury than, say, the Yankees have out of their blue chip youngsters. On the other hand, Jeremy Bonderman is something of a cautionary tale from the same organization. Sometimes they just get hurt.",
