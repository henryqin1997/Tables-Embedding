    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{88610=A corroded carbon steel sheet (AISI type 1010 carbon steel, 10\ufffd15 cm) was obtained from the Naval Warfare Research Center, Carderock Division, U.S. Navy. The extensive corrosion of the surface of the as-received carbon steel sheet was brown-red and loose. This suggests the presence of predominantly amorphous hydrated Fe2O3 (as FeO and Fe3O4 are black, and hematite, \u03b1-Fe2O3, will not dissolve in HEDPA alone). To better observe changes in the metal surface, half the sample was submerged in the HEDPA gel solution at 90\ufffd C. for a given time, creating a clear reaction or prewetting surface interface. Following testing, the sample was removed, the treated half was rinsed in warm (50\ufffd C.) deionized water, and air-dried for further analysis., 36764=In the nuclear industry, the applications of foams have been popular. The successful applications of foams to complex equipment at both the West Valley Demonstration Project and Savannah River Site have demonstrated significant waste reduction in some cases up to 70%. [R. A. Meigs, \u201cUse of Foam Chemical for Decontamination\u201d Proceedings of the International Decommissioning Symposium, Pittsburgh, Pa., Oct. 4\u20138, 1987, pp IV23\u2013IV30 (1987)][B. Guthrie, \u201cFoam Decontamination of Reactors and Reactor Loops. A Literature Review\u201d, Batelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory Report HW-57642 (1958)] Industry has used foams to decontaminate glove boxes, glove boxes, and other hard to get to configurations. [J. M. Harris et al, \u201cA Foam Process for Application of Decontamination Agents,\u201d Decontamination of Nuclear Facilities: International Joint Topical Meeting ANS-CAN, Niagara Falls, Canada, Sep. 19\u201322, 1982, pp. 4\u201337, 4\u201380 (1982)] The application of foams in closed configurations is one of the hardness and extreme care must be taken during the decontamination process., 60724=The formo-hydroxamic acid (FHA) and the aceto-hydroxamic acid (AHA) have been used as reducing/complexing agent in actinide separation processes [R. J. Taylor et al \u201cThe Applications of Formo-and Aceto-hydroximic Acid in Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing\u201d J. Alloy Compounds 271\u2013273, 534 (1998)]. The unique chemical characteristics of these organic acids include: (1) The oxygen donor ligand has shown a strong affinity for hard metal ions such as Fe3+, Al3+, Np3+, and Pu4+. (2) The small organic backbone ensures low solubility in hydrophobic solvents. (3) The hydroxamic acids decompose into NO2 and CO2. For example in 6M HNO3, FHA will decompose into diatomic gases [I. May et al, \u201cThe Formation of Hydrophilic Np(IV) Complexes and Their Potential Application in Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing\u201d (1998)]. More importantly, the hydroxamic acids are rapid reducing agents for Np(VI) without the reduction of U(VI) [R. J. Taylor \u201cThe Reduction of Actinide Ions by Hydroxamic Acids\u201dCzech. J. Phys. 49, 617(1999)] Hydroxamic acids with a low carbon backbone, such as FHA and AHA have been shown to aid in the selective separation of Np (IV) from U(VI) by selectively forming a Np(IV) hydrophilic complex [R. J. Taylor et al \u201cThe Oxidation of Np(IV) by Nitric Acid in 100% TBP and Diluted TBP/n-dodecane Solutions\u201d J. Alloy Compounds 271\u2013273, 817 (1998)]. For both FHA and AHA, Taylor has shown that between 0.1 and 1M HNO3 Np(IV) was preferred over U(VI) but above 1.8M HNO3 some U(VI) complexation was observed. Furthermore both FHA and AHA have been reported to form a red complex with Pu(IV) ions, which transform in to the blue Pu(III). In nitric acid systems the best conditions for using the hydroxamic acids are in <3M HNO3, where the hydroxamic acid hydrolysis to give hydroxylamine and the parent carboxylic acid (RCOOH) is minimized: RCONHOH+H++H2O \u21c4RCOOH+H3NOH+\u2003\u2003(1), 64266=There are extensive reviews on the stability constants and complexation properties of hydroxamic acids, but many focus on the benzohydroxamic acid complexes [Chatterjee-1978]. Metals of interest for decontamination processing include Fe(III), U(VI), Zr(VI), Th(VI), Pu(VI), rare earths, and Al(III) [Baroncelli et al, \u201cThe Complex Power of Hydroxamic Acids and Its Effect on Behavior of Organic Extractants in the Reprocessing of Irradiated Fuels: I The Complexes between Benzohydroxamic Acid and Zr, Fe(III), and U(VI)\u201d J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem 27, 1085\u20131092 (1965)], [A. Barocas et al, \u201cThe Complex Power of Hydroxamic Acids and Its Effect on Behavior of Organic Extractants in the Reprocessing of Irradiated Fuels: II The Complexes between Benzohydroxamic Acid and Th, U(IV), and Pu(IV)\u201d J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem 28, 2961\u20132967 (1966)][V. G. Anderegg, et al, \u201cHydroxamartkomplexes II. Die Anwendung der pH-Methods\u201d Helv. Chim. Acta 46, 1400 (1963)]. Stability constants for AHA and benzohydroxamic are shown in TABLE 3., 166205=The polymethylene polyether isocynate based foam PPI was prepared in a 10:1 volume ratio with an HEDPA/AHA solution. The final concentration of HEDPA and AHA were 6 M, and 0.001 M respectively. The DF values for Plutonium and Uranium are shown in TABLE 16 as an average of the \u03b1 emitters, and the average DF for Ni, Tc, Fe, Co, and Am are illustrated as the average \u03b3 emitter. In the \u03b1 emitter cases, the DFs was 890 which very impressive and for the \u03b3 emitters the DF were 136 for a once time application which is also very remarkable DFs for an hour compared to other foam decontamination processes., 15392=A variety of chemicals are used to decontaminate surfaces including organic acid, complexants, and mineral acids see for instance Nunez et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,504,077 issued January 2003, Horwitz et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,078,894 issued January 1992, U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,531 issued Jul. 26, 1994, U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,142 issued December 1996 and the disclosures that are incorporated herein by reference. The Waller et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,810,405 issued March 1989 is also incorporated by reference. Strong acids will dissolve oxide scale; however, they will also dissolve the metallic substrate and have limited solubility in gel or foam systems. Weak acids such as organic acids (e.g., citric acid, oxalic acid, EDTA) are also added into decontamination solvents with the purpose of dissolving and complexing the dissolved metal oxide components. Additionally, the formation of gels and foams with the weak organic acids has shown negligible decontamination of surfaces. Various reviews have evaluated the need of Decontamination & Decommissioning (D&D) of surfaces and equipment within Department of Energy (DOE) and surveyed D&D processes suitable to DOE and industrial applications. In general, decontamination of equipment prior to decommissioning does not require the protection of the base metal. However, gel and foam processing can led to more efficient processing and reduce waste generation. In the current invention we discuss gel and foam based HEDPA chemical solutions which are unique in that they can provide protection to the base metal for continued application of the equipment and reduce the final waste form production to one step. The HEDPA based gels and foams can even be applied at room temperature which has not been effective in radioactive decontamination processes. Gel and foam based HEDPA processes allow for decontamination of difficult to reach surfaces unmanageable with traditional aqueous process methods. Also, the gel and foam components are optimized to maximize the dissolution rate and assist in the chemical transformation of the gel or foam to a stable waste form., 30767=Various chemicals are used to decontaminate surfaces including organic acids, complexants, and mineral acids, see for instance Horwitz et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,078,894 issued January, 1992, U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,531 issued Jul. 26, 1994, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,142 issued December, 1996 and the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference. The Waller et al. U.S. Pat. No 4,810,405 issued March, 1989 is also incorporated by reference. Many mineral acids (e.g., HF, HNO3, H2SO4) are used in decontamination solvents to dissolve oxide scales. Strong acids will dissolve the oxide scales; however they will also dissolve the metallic substrate. Typical dissolution rates of unreacted metals in mineral acids are significantly higher than the dissolution rate of oxidized metal. The dissolution of the metal substrate will deplete the acid effectiveness toward the oxide scale dissolution, increase waste volume, and compromise the structural integrity. Weak acids such as the organic acids (e.g., citric acid, oxalic acid, EDTA) are also added into decontamination solvent with the dual purpose of dissolving and complexing the dissolved metal oxide components. The presence of chelating agents such as EDTA and citric acid with contaminated waste stream pose major problems during the volume reduction phase of the process. Ion exchange columns or sorption beds are less effective when organic complexing agents are in solution. EDTA and other complexing agents have high thermal and hydrolytic stability and their destruction requires harsh conditions and still can generate interfering species., 160865=The ionic liquid based gel C10mimCl was prepared in a 2:1 volume ratio with an HEDPA/AHA solution. The final concentration of HEDPA and AHA were 3.69 M, and 0.001 M respectively. The DF values for Plutonium and Uranium are shown in TABLE 15 as an average of the \u03b1 emitters, and the average DF for Ni, Tc, Fe, Co, and Am are illustrated as the average \u03b3 emitter. In both cases, the DFs were approximately in the 15\u201320 range which is very impressive DFs for a one time coating at room temperature for an hour compared to other gel decontamination processes., 55167=Depending on the chemical nature of the complexant, the reaction can shift into the cathodic region that favors the iron oxide dissolution or into the anodic region that decreases dissolution. In general, a compound that would increase dissolution of iron oxide would have the following chemical features (1) increase reduction of Fe3+, (2) strong acidity, and (3) a strong (Fe3+) chelator. Very few compounds have all three characteristics. The commercially available HEDPA is a strong acid pka1=1.56, pka2=2.20, (pka1+pka2=3.76) and also a good complexant for Fe3+ over Fe2+[\u03b2(Fe3+)=16.2, (\u03b2(Fe2+)=3.0]. Furthermore, it is believed that HEDPA has reducing power for Fe3+ in the dissolution of magnetite. It is also known that adding a reducing agent such as AHA will affect the dissolution rate of various forms of iron oxide. Although the exact binding mechanism has not been determined, the two phosphonic groups, each having a doubly bound oxygen and two hydroxyl groups, are bound to a single carbon atom and act as Lewis base. According to known experimental data, diphosphonic acids with, both phosphonate groups bound to the same carbon atom in the carbon backbone form the most stable complexes. This aids in the functionality of the HEDPA anion as it is free to attack a metal ion with an oxidation state of (II), (III), or higher. It has been found that the stoichiometric ratio of a lanthanide HEPDA complex was 1:3 in highly acid solution thus forming Ln (III)H2X3 complex (X2\u2212 is the double deprotonated diphosphonic species). This is derived by assuming that the complexation is monodentate, bidentate, and mixed mono and bidentate., 143840=A heavily corroded piece of AISI type 1010 carbon steel was tested. The extensive corrosion of the surface of the carbon steel sheet was brown-red in color and loose. This suggests the presence of predominantly amorphous hydrated Fe2O3 (as FeO and Fe3O4 is black and hematite, Fe2O3, will not dissolve in HEDPA alone). The oxide was completely dissolved with the foam solution at room temperature and the gel after heating at 90\ufffd C. with an hour treatment time. A clear interface was obtained during the dissolution. An increase in the HEDPA and H3PO4 concentration, 5.0 M HEDPA and 6.8 M H3PO4, did not noticeably increase the rate of dissolution., 82080=The rates and activation energies for both FHA and AHA at 25\ufffd C. are listed in TABLE 4. For AHA, the decomposition rate is 0.00205 mol/(L\ufffdmin) at 25\ufffd C. with an activation energy of 79.9\ufffd2.9 kJ/mol [J. D. Glennor et al, Anal. Chem. 61 1474 (1989)]. TABLE 5 shows the half-life of degradation of AHA vs the hydrogen ion activity. As can be seen from these results, half the AHA will be destroyed in eleven hours when the hydrogen activity is 0.5 M, however, the activity decreases to about an hour at activities greater than 5M. In the presence of an organic acid such as HEDPA and IL solvents, the AHA destruction will occur in an even longer time than in low nitric acid concentrations. Barkatt et al U.S. Pat. No 5,434,331 teaches that decontamination of steam generator solid surfaces contaminated with radioactive or heavy metal species using a solution based on aceto-hydroxamic acid to decontaminate steam generator sludge or radioactive or heavy metal species using AHA in solution or on a solid support. However, Backatt et al does not teach (1) the use of AHA as a reducing agent to increase dissolution of organic chelator combined with HEDPA, (2) treatment at temperature greater than 170\ufffd C. or at time longer than two hours beyond the expected decomposition of AHA, (3) decontamination in gel and foam formulations and methods, (4) evaluate radioactive metal beyond activation products which have more complex chemistries than the transition metals, and (5) although the thermal and chemical decomposition with AHA are possible the final faith of the radioactive species were never determined with the AHA process.}",
