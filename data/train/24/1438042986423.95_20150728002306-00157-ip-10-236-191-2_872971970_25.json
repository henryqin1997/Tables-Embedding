A media TimeScale of 30000 and media sample durations of 1001, along with a movie TimeScale of 30000, provide 19.9 hours of time in 32 bits., 77081=The following values, from the 1953 FCC NTSC spec, are obsolete. If you are told your image is coded with these values, you almost definitely want the SMPTE 170M-1994 values (code 6 above) instead:, 55125=As an example, say width is 1280 (as it is for 1280x720 HDTV video, SMPTE 296M-1997). 1280 is not a multiple of 48. So each line in the file occupies 1296 pixels (3456 bytes) instead of 1280 pixels. Say width is 1920 (as it is for 1920x1080 HDTV video, SMPTE 274M-1995). 1920 is a multiple of 48. So each line in the file occupies exactly 1920 pixels (5120 bytes)., 102260=Here is a comparable chart for the existing standard definition formats with 16:9 picture aspect ratio. With the exception of the 18 MHz format, the formats below are electrically identical to the ones in the table above. Typically you use the 16:9 formats below by pushing a button labeled \"16:9\" on a standard 4:3 monitor; the monitor takes the same signal and displays it vertically compressed. The clean apertures of the 16:9 formats have the same number of pixels and lines as the 4:3 formats above. The difference is that 16:9 cameras will capture data 16 units wide by 9 units high into the clean aperture, and 16:9 monitors will display the clean aperture such that it is 16 units wide by 9 units high on the display surface, instead of 4 by 3. Since the clean aperture still has the same number of pixels and lines but now has a different picture aspect ratio, you can map 4:3 values above into 16:9 values below by simply multiplying by (16/9)/(4/3)=(4/3). The 18 MHz SMPTE 267M-1995 standard is exceptional in that its clean aperture has 4/3 as many pixels per line so that the pixels can retain the pixel aspect ratio of 525-line 4:3 digital video (10/11)., 1098=8-bit-per-component 4:4:4:4, 62509=Recommendation ITU-R BT.709-2, SMPTE 274M-1995, and SMPTE 296M-1997., 25042=Scheme B comes from digital video industry specifications such as Rec. ITU-R BT. 601-4. All standard digital video tape formats (e.g., SMPTE D-1, SMPTE D-5) and all standard digital video links (e.g., SMPTE 259M-1997 serial digital video) use this scheme. Professional video storage and processing equipment from vendors such as Abekas, Accom, and SGI also use this scheme. MPEG-2, DVC and many other codecs specify source Y\u00b4CbCr pixels using this scheme., 105235=Design of the HDTV formats had the benefit of hindsight. These formats define a clean aperture whose picture aspect ratio is exactly 16:9. Looking at the number of pixels and lines in the clean aperture, you can compute the pixel aspect ratio. One need not consider the luma sampling frequency., 107671=1920x1080 HDTV (SMPTE 274M-1995, 148.5 MHz (60 frame/sec), 148.5/1.001 MHz (60/1.001 frame/sec), 74.25 MHz (30 frame/sec), 74.25/1.001 MHz (30/1.001 frame/sec)), 84916=buffer contains a 2:1 interlaced image. there are four possible address orderings:, 117558=(2303/4400)*(line period) from 0H, or halfway between luma sample 1151 and 1152 from 0H as per SMPTE 240M-1995, or halfway between luma sample 959 and 960 of digital active line., 118219=SMPTE 274M-1995, 75154=EY\u00b4 = 0.7152 EG\u00b4 + 0.0722 EB\u00b4 + 0.2126 ER\u00b4, 79373=720x483 progressive 16:9 (SMPTE 293M-1996), 13493=The 30/1.001 rate of NTSC and digital 525 is sometimes approximated to (or mistaken to be) 29.97, which does not equal 30/1.001. The average rate of drop-frame timecode (e.g., LTC and VITC used in the video industry) over 24 hours is exactly 29.97, but the use of drop-frame timecode does not modify the video signal rate. Some existing movies have a media TimeScale of 2997, media sample durations of 100, and a movie TimeScale of 2997. This provides 8.2 days of time before 32-bit overflow, however after 4.6 hours, this representation deviates from the actual video timing by half a frame time. For tracks with a 2997 timescale which are longer than 4.6 hours, a frame-accurate representation of the video timing is only possible if the frames are allowed to have differing durations., 70077=Recommendation ITU-R BT.709-2, SMPTE 274M-1995, SMPTE 296M-1997, SMPTE 293M-1996 and SMPTE 170M-1994., 37760=The codec name to use is \"Component Y'CbCrA 8-bit 4:4:4:4\"., 74891=Recommendation ITU-R BT.709-2 (1125/60/2:1 only), SMPTE 274M-1995 and SMPTE 296M-1997., 932=8-bit-per-component 4:4:4, 106566=1920x1035 HDTV (SMPTE 240M-1995, SMPTE 260M-1992, 74.25 MHz (30 frames/sec) or 74.25/1.001 MHz (30/1.001 frames/sec)) according to SMPTE 260M-1992 informative annex B, 119435=(1799/3300)*(line period) from 0H, or halfway between luma sample 639 and 640 as per SMPTE 296M-1997, 112140=For QuickTime images representing unscaled video from some video interface standard, you must set horizOff to a multiple of horiz_align_pixels (which we defined along with each compression type) and you must set cleanApertureWidth and cleanApertureHeight to the clean aperture of the interface standard. See Typical width, height, and 'clap' Settings below for the clean aperture values to use. For example, if horiz_align_pixels is 2, this will guarantee that the leftmost Y\u00b4 sample of each line of your QuickTime image (which is always a Y\u00b40 sample for 4:2:2 images, as explained in Y\u00b4CbCr Spatial Relationship above) maps to the location of a Y\u00b40 sample in the video signal., 99406=4:3 Standard Definition Format, 117970=1888x1018 or 1888x1017, 117851=1920x1035, 98985=There is widespread confusion about the pixel aspect ratio of standard definition video formats. If your device transfers one of these 4:3 picture aspect ratio video formats, these are the correct pixel aspect ratios:, 77911=EY\u00b4 = 0.7154 EG\u00b4 + 0.0721 EB\u00b4 + 0.2125 ER\u00b4, 65314=SMPTE C Primaries from SMPTE RP 145-1993. Used in SMPTE 170M-1994, SMPTE 293M-1996, SMPTE 240M-1995, and interim color implementation of SMPTE 274M-1995., 105541=For 1920x1035 HDTV (SMPTE 240M-1995, SMPTE 260M-1992), the clean aperture size is uncertain. SMPTE 240M-1995 and SMPTE 260M-1992 specify a clean aperture of 1888 pixels by 1017 lines. However, SMPTE RP 187-1995 specifies a clean aperture of 1888 pixels by 1018 lines. 1018 seems to be the more sensible value: since the picture center is located halfway between two lines, a clean aperture height which is 0 mod 2 puts the top and bottom of the clean aperture on lines instead of between lines. Industry practice will decide. Here are the values:, 139471=The three different 10-bit, 4:2:2 Y\u00b4CbCr formats used by:, 106861=1920x1035 HDTV (SMPTE 240M-1995, SMPTE 260M-1992, 74.25 MHz (30 frames/sec) or 74.25/1.001 MHz (30/1.001 frames/sec)) according to SMPTE RP 187-1995, 103642=16:9 Standard Definition Format, 61190=CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates of red primary, green primary, blue primary and white point., 114347=For the 525- and 625-line formats, the dimensions of the production and clean apertures depend on the luma sampling frequency. In the 'pasp' ImageDescription extension above, we explained how luma sampling frequency relates to pixel aspect ratio and picture aspect ratio. In that section, we also explained why the clean aperture dimensions below do not match those found in SMPTE RP 187-1995., 66800=The following values, from Recommendation ITU-R BT.470-4 System M and the 1953 FCC NTSC spec, are obsolete and have never been used to code any digital image. If you are told your image is coded with these values, you almost definitely want the SMPTE C primaries (code 6 above) instead:, 16303=Ideally, you would choose a TimeScale which is the least common multiple of the audio and video media TimeScales. Audio tracks typically have a TimeScale equal to the number of audio frames per second (e.g., 22050, 44100, 48000). For some combinations of common audio and video media TimeScales, this will again result in 32-bit time overflow. This tradeoff must be made according to application needs., 117250=SMPTE 240M-1995, SMPTE 260M-1992, 100050=Digital 525 (SMPTE 125M-1995, 13.5 MHz), 118345=2:1 interlaced: halfway between line 291 (field 1) and 853 (field 2). progressive: halfway between line 581 and 582., 39713=The codec name to use is \"Component Y'CbCr 10,12,14,16-bit 4:2:2\"., 81976=1 for progressive scan, 2 for 2:1 interlaced, 1606=10-bit-per-component 4:2:2, 117158=1125-line (1920x1035) HDTV, 75670=Recommendation ITU-R BT.601-4, Recommendation ITU-R BT.470-4 System B and G, SMPTE 170M-1994 and SMPTE 293M-1996., 59033=R, G, and B are tristimulus values (e.g., candelas/meter2), whose relationship to CIE XYZ tristimulus values can be derived from the set of primaries and white point chosen by the primaries parameter of the 'colr' extension using the method described in SMPTE RP 177-1993.

The picture aspect ratio is typically 4:3 or 16:9., 79809=1920x1035 HDTV (SMPTE 240M-1995, SMPTE 260M-1992), 107069=1062, 36234=The codec name to use is \"Component Y'CbCr 8-bit 4:4:4\"., 80176=1920x1080 HDTV (SMPTE 274M-1995), 42321=The codec name to use is \"Component Y'CbCr 10-bit 4:4:4\"., 14292=Most applications today only deal with material shorter than 4.6 hours. These applications should be able to read video movies with either 2997 or 30000 TimeScales. They may write either, but the 30000 TimeScale is preferred since it has a sufficient overflow time and precisely models the video signal., 61873=The values below correspond to those in the sequence display extension defined in MPEG-2 (Rec. ITU-T H.262 (1995 E) section 6.3.6)., 28403=The remaining component values (e.g., 1-15 and 241-254 for n=8 bits and 4-63 and 961-1019 for n=10 bits) accommodate occasional filter undershoot and overshoot in image processing. In some applications, these values are used to carry other information (e.g., transparency). The writer of a QuickTime image may use these values and the reader of a QuickTime image must expect these values., 98525=Pixel aspect ratio is not the same as \"picture aspect ratio,\" which is defined in Pixel Aspect Ratio, Clean Aperture, and Picture Aspect Ratio above. Examples of common picture aspect ratios are 4:3 and 16:9., 79203=Digital 525 (SMPTE 125M-1995 (4:3 parallel), SMPTE 267M-1995 (16:9 parallel), SMPTE 259M-1997 (serial)), 17678=For each 4:4:4 or 4:4:4:4 compression type, we will describe the bit position of a Y\u00b4, Cb, Cr, and (for 4:4:4:4) alpha (A) component. At each \"pixel,\" there is a sample of all components:, 119164=SMPTE 296M-1997, 104347=720x483 progressive 16:9 (SMPTE 293M-1996, 13.5 MHz), 138647=Using the 2 don't care bits of the 10:10:10:2 packings available as alpha., 131019=Note that all parameters except field dominance have been constrained above to a single value. Therefore all possible permutations of the ImageDescription parameters and ImageDescription extension parameters have been reduced to 1 (progressive scan signal) or 2 (2:1 interlaced signal, with either dominance) permutations., 80048=1920x1080 HDTV interim color implementation (SMPTE 274M-1995), 104222=Digital 525 (SMPTE 267M-1995, 13.5 MHz), 45108=The codec name to use is \"Component Y'CbCr 10-bit 4:2:2\"., 118574=(2303/4400)*(line period) from 0H, or halfway between luma sample 1151 and 1152 from 0H as per SMPTE 274M-1995, or halfway between luma sample 959 and 960 of digital active line., 107037=1018, 71464=EW\u00b4 = 1.1115 W0.45 - 0.1115, 28134=For n=8 bits, these are values 0 and 255. For n=10 bits, these are values 0, 1, 2, 3, 1020, 1021, 1022, and 1023. The writer of a QuickTime image is responsible for omitting these values. The reader of a QuickTime image may assume that they are not present., 101686=In theory, the non-square pixel aspect ratios above, and therefore also the square luma sampling frequencies, are superseded by the new calculations in SMPTE RP 187-1995. However, because the standard definition pixel aspect ratios from that spec do not reflect the actual ratios used by any existing (and probably future) standard definition equipment, you should use the values above. For the same reason, the 13.5 MHz and 18 MHz clean aperture figures which we will present in Typical width, height, and 'clap' Settings differ from those in SMPTE RP 187-1995., 8367=We will use the term \"buffer\" to describe an image in memory or in a QuickTime file. \"Address\" refers to a memory address or a file offset. An image buffer has height lines and is width pixels wide. A \"pixel\" is a luma sampling instant (we will illustrate this for 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 below). The bytes_per_luma_instant quantity, which we will define below for each compression type, specifies the number of bytes per pixel., 141334=Copyright \u00a9 1999 Apple Computer, Inc.

Pappas (Bellingham, Wash.: SPIE, 1998)., 93670=Even applications that produce synthetic imagery (e.g., animation applications) should label output clips with a 'clap' ImageDescription extension. The application should allow the user to position objects relative to the (typically 4:3 or 16:9) clean aperture. For example, this allows the output of multiple animation applications to be combined without manual alignment. And it allows an application to synthesize imagery using data originally derived from video signals (e.g., keys, mattes, motion capture data, shape capture data) and then re-combine that imagery with the original video signals without manual alignment., 115190=2:1 interlaced: halfway between line 404 (field 2) and 142 (field 1). progressive: halfway between line 283 and 284., 104777=Digital 525 (SMPTE 267M-1995, 18 MHz), 600=8-bit-per-component 4:2:2, 31005=We will define two 8-bit 4:2:2 compression types:, 91504=An example. Say a user imports two clips with a 4:3 picture aspect ratio into an NLE application and performs a transition such as a cross-fade between the two clips. The application needs to know how to align the pixels of each source clip in the final result. Even if both clips have the same width and height, they don't necessarily represent the same region of the display device (or, equivalently, the video signal). This is because the clips may have been captured on different video digitizer devices which digitize different regions of the incoming video signal. The user notices that one or both of the clips appear \"shifted\" in the final output. Multiple generations of processing produce even more pronounced shifts., 16991=For each 4:2:2 compression type, we will describe the bit position of a Y\u00b40, Y\u00b41, Cb, and Cr component. For this document, \"pixels\" in 4:2:2 implies luma (Y\u00b4) sampling instants. The leftmost luma (Y\u00b4) sample of each line in a QuickTime buffer is a Y\u00b40 sample.
