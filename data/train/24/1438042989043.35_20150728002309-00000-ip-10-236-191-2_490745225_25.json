For example, \u201c36C70 SCSI IC Technical Reference Manual\u201d by Future Domain Corporation, 2801 McGraw Avenue, Irvine, Calif. 92714, November 1993, discloses a host adapter in which \u201c[a] minimal amount of external glue logic is required to serialize the parallel ROM data\u201d (page 3-1). During system start-up, the information from the adaptor read-only-memory can be copied into system memory 170 for quick access by host processor 161, sometimes referred to as microprocessor 161., 305303=In one embodiment, command executor 1370 includes board control register and monitoring circuitry that detects the presence or absence of cables connected and terminators installed for input-output bus 284 (FIG. 4) and so there is no need for board control logic 370 external to slave serial port input-output circuit 254., 302672=Then sequencer 1330 transitions from send identification state 1412 to send external status state 1413, waits for twelve clock cycles during which time shift register 1310 clocks out byte ESTAT as a packet on pin 341 and then transitions to wait-for-start state 1420., 299239=In response to a packet from shift register 1310, sequencer 1330 transitions through a sequence of states that is specific to the command byte in the received packet and generates control signals that drive command executor 1370. In response to a packet that contains a reset command packet, sequencer 1330 that is waiting in wait-for-start state 1420FIG. 14) initializes all of the state variables and continuous in wait-for-start state 1420., 293217=When byte error enable signal BERREN goes active on an error control bus 550, parity circuit 1020 passes the incorrect parity bit to serial data terminal 527, and so exercises the parity circuit in a slave serial port input-output circuit 254. In response to an active read serial port signal READSPIO after completing the transmission of the packet, shifter state machine 720 drives serial port enable signal SPIOEN inactive. In response to the inactive serial port enable signal SPIOEN, line controller 530 three states output driver 1220 (FIG. 12B), that is connected to pin 241. So, output signal from pin 241 is inhibited and pin 241 is usable as an input pin and line controller 530 waits for an acknowledge packet to be returned from SSPIOC 254 to pin 241 and passed as signal SPIOI by input buffer 1223., 310086=In one embodiment, in response to a high signal on memory chip select line MCS#, ID-ESTAT detector 1375 senses signals at a number of high address lines, such as first memory address line MA17 and second memory address line MA16. If ID-ESTAT detector 1375 senses a low signal on first memory address line MA17 and also a low signal on second memory address line MA 16, ID-ESTAT detector 1375 determines that the size of EEPROM 390 is only 64 kilobytes. If ID-ESTAT detector 1375 senses a high signal on second memory address line MA16, and either (1) a low signal on first memory address line MA17 or (2) a high signal on first memory address line MA17, the size of EEPROM 390 is 128 kilobytes or 256 kilobytes respectively., 298979=In another embodiment, shift register 1310 transfers 12 bits of the shifted in data to sequencer 1330. In this embodiment, if each of the 12 bits is zero, sequencer 1330 interprets the 12 bits as the reset command byte., 290922=Stages 1014_1, 1014_2, . . . 1014_I, . . . and 1014_N of shift register 1014 are connected in series so that a bit stored in a stage, such as stage 1014_N is transferred to a successive stage, in the direction from 1014_N to 1014_1 with stage 1014_N as the serial shift-in stage and stage 1014_1 as the serial shift-out stage on each rising edge of signal CLK40B. In FIG. 10, there are a total of eight stages in shift register 1014. On each rising edge of buffered clock signal CLK40B, the bit stored in the last stage 1014_1 drives a signal on output terminal 1011 that is coupled to an input line 1021 of parity circuit 1020., 291724=In one embodiment, a stage, such as one of stages 1014_1, . . . 1014_N is implemented by a two to one multiplexer 1110 (FIG. 11) and a storage element such as flip-flop 1120. On each rising edge of buffered clock signal CLK40B, a signal from the previous stage drives terminal D0 of multiplexer 1110, except that serial port input signal SPIOI received at pin 241 drives the first stage. A signal from input multiplexer 1012 (FIG. 10) drives terminal D1 of multiplexer 1110. Moreover, signal SENDBYTE drives terminal S0 of multiplexer 1110. In response to active signal SENDBYTE, multiplexer 1110 passes the signal on terminal D1 to flip-flop 1120 and otherwise supplies the signal on terminal D0 to flip-flop 1120., 299972=In response to a reset signal on a reset pin 1501 (FIG. 15) that is coupled to a reset line of system bus 250, such as the PCI bus, the slave serial port input-output circuit 254 is reset and sequencer 1330 starts in a hard reset state 1410, initializes variables, goes to reset acknowledge state 1411 and signals command executor 1370 to receive device identification byte IDDAT and external resource status byte ESTAT from for example, a programmable logic circuit 330., 325277=In the embodiment of FIG. 19, SSPIOC 1910A and SSPIOC 1910B are coupled to host adapters 1920 and 1930 respectively and allow these two host adapters to share one or more common memory resources, such as shared resources 1951, 1952 and 1953 through a shared bus arbiter 1960. Computer system 1900 (FIG. 19) also includes a host adapter 1940 of the type described in \u201cAIC-7870PCI Bus Master Single-Chip SCSI Host Adapter Data Book-Preliminary\u201d referenced above that can also access shared resources 1951, 1952, and 1953 via shared bus arbiter 1960., 303001=In response to a signal from shift register 1310 indicating receipt of a start bit that is denoted in FIG. 14 as \u201cSB\u201d, sequencer 1330 transitions from wait-for-start state 1420 to shift-in-command state 1421. Sequencer 1330 loops back in shift-in-command state 1421 for nine clock cycles while shift register 1310 clocks in the rest of the packet from pin 341., 296392=In response to an active LED test signal LEDTST, line controller 530 passes one of eight internal signals TSTSIGNI[7:0] that is selected by the value of bits TESTSEL[2:0] described above, to output driver 1220. In response to the active LED test signal LEDTST, output driver 1220 passes the selected internal signal to pin 241., 310921=In response to a low signal on memory write line MWR#, ID-ESTAT detector 1375 determines that a read only memory ROM is coupled to slave serial port input-output circuit 254, rather than an EEPROM., 303437=If sequencer 1330 is unable to decode the received command, sequencer 1330 transitions back to wait-for-start state 1420., 298190=In response to a start bit on slave serial port pin 341, hereinafter slave pin 341, that is connected to line SPIO-, a shift register 1310 in slave serial port in put-output circuit 254 shifts data in serially from slave pin 341 and transfers the shifted in data to sequencer 1330. In one embodiment, shift register 1310 transfers 11 bits of the shifted in data to sequencer 1330. The 11 bits comprise the received packet including a start bit, a command byte, a parity bit and a stop bit as described above. In this embodiment, when all of the 11 bits have the value zero, sequencer 1330 determines that the received packet contains a reset command byte indicative of signal CHIPRSTREQ as described above., 72415=In one embodiment, instruction router 311 receives an internal signal LED- on master input-output bus 245 from a status switching circuit that is described in copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/301,458, Attorney Docket No. M-2933, entitled \u201cStatus Indicator for a Host Adapter\u201d of Stillman F. Gates and Charles S. Fannin, filed on Sep. 7, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,657,455, that is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In one embodiment, a hardware module, or firmware or software of host adapter 240 turns on and off LED 350 as described for LED request signal LEDREQ in Table 1 below. Table 1 lists examples of conditions under which various command signals are generated by master serial port input-output circuit 210. Tables 2-9 list definitions of the bits of various registers in master serial port input-output circuit 210. Some of the bit definitions and signal values described herein are similar or identical to those described in \u201cA1C-7870 PCI Bus Master Single-Chip SCSI Host Adapter Data Book-Preliminary\u201d published in December 1993 available from Adaptec, Inc. 691 South Milpitas Boulevard, Milpitas, Calif. 95035, that is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 289798=Packet controller 740 includes a shifter circuit 1010 and a parity circuit 1020. In response to an active send byte signal SENDBYTE, parity circuit 1020 loads the value of signal SENDBYTE as a start bit in to send output register 1023., 301847=In response to the signal from ID-ESTAT detector 1375, sequencer 1330 transitions to send identification state 1412 and supplies signals for multiplexer 1360 to pass byte IDDAT to shift register 1310. In send identification state 1412, sequencer 1330 loops back for ten clock cycles, indicated in FIG. 14 by \u201cX10\u201d for a total of eleven clock cycles in send identification state 1412. In send identification state 1412, shift register 1310 clocks out byte IDDAT in an initialization packet on pin 341. In one embodiment, an exclusive OR gate (not shown) computes and stores a parity bit for a byte stored in shift register 1310 on a clock cycle immediately subsequent to the clock cycle in which the byte is stored., 308350=Host adapter 240 receives signal PCIRSTB- from slave serial port input-output circuit 254 at reset input pin 1521 that is different from serial port pin 241. Host adapter 240 passes signal PCIRSTB- through input buffer 1522 and reset line RSTIB- to serial port 230. Master serial port input-output circuit 210 uses flip-flops 1541 and 1542 to double synchronize the reset signal from input buffer 1522., 300519=In reset acknowledge state 1411, sequencer 1330 also causes acknowledge multiplexer 1320 to send an acknowledge packet on pin 341 that is coupled to line SPIO- for as long as sequencer 1330 stays in reset acknowledge state 1411. Sequencer 1330 stays in reset acknowledge state 1411 for a variable number of clock cycles depending on the time needed by ID-ESTAT detector 1375 which depends on, for example presence or absence of programmable logic circuit 330 (FIG. 3)., 294153=When send byte signal SENDBYTE is inactive, parallel input multiplexer 1012 only transfers serial port input signal SPIOI from serial port input line 522 that is coupled to pin 241, to the input pin of first stage 1014-N of shift register 1014., 307872=In response to an active signal PCIRST-, slave serial port input-output circuit 254 buffers signal PCIRST- in input buffer 1502 for internal use by flip-flop 1505, for example to generate reset command signal CHPRSTREQ. Slave serial port input-output circuit 254 buffers the buffered signal PCIRST- in output buffer 1503 and drives signal PCIRSTB- on output terminal 1504 for external use by host adapter 240., 301084=In response to a reset signal on pin 1501, ID-ESTAT detector 1375 clocks in bytes IDDAT and ESTAT from a programmable logic circuit 330. While waiting for bytes IDDAT and ESTAT, if ID-ESTAT detector 1375 times out, for example, due to absence of programmable logic circuit 330, then ID-ESTAT detector 1375 uses a default byte as byte IDDAT and creates byte ESTAT by sensing the signals on various pins for presence or absence of pull up or pull down resistors on plug-in board 270, as described below in reference to FIG. 16. ID-ESTAT detector 1375 then signals sequencer 1330, when bytes IDDAT and ESTAT are assembled and ready for transmission to host adapter 240., 290452=In response to the active send byte signal SENDBYTE, on the next rising edge of buffered clock signal CLK40B a parallel input multiplexer 1012 in shifter circuit 1010 passes shift out signals SHFTOUT[7:0] on parallel input terminal D1 that is connected to parallel bus 523 simultaneously, in parallel, one bit to each stage in a shift register 1014 also included in shifter circuit 1010., 290088=In response to an active chip reset signal CHPRSTBSY, parity circuit 1020 drives a serial port output signal SPIOO active (low) on serial data terminal 527. In response to the active chip reset signal CHPRSTBSY, line controller 530 passes serial port output signal SPIOO to pin 241 as illustrated in FIG. 12B., 299744=In one embodiment, sequencer 1330 is encoded as a \u201cone-hot\u201d state machine 1400 (FIG. 14) having flip-flops associated with each of 36 states as listed at page 19 of Microfiche Appendix B., 322810=One embodiment of support circuit 1800 (FIG. 18) includes a plurality of slave serial port input-output circuits, such as SSPIOC 254A, SSPIOC 254B and SSPIOC 254C that are all connected to the same serial port input-output line SPIO- that is coupled to the serial port pin 241 of host adapter 240. Each of the slave serial port input-output circuits 254A, 254B and 254C receive the same clock signals CLK40 from oscillator 260 that is also supplied to host adapter 240. Each slave serial port input-output circuit allows host adapter 240 to access a resource that is connected to that particular slave serial port input-output circuit similar to the above description in reference to SSPIOC 254 and host adapter 240. For example, host adaptor 240 can access resources 1810 and 1820 through SSPIOC 254A, resources 1830 and 1840 through SSPIC 254B and resource 1850 through SSPIOC 254C., 294452=In response to an active set shift-in valid signal SETSIVALID on set shift-in valid line 741, an output multiplexer 1016 simultaneously, in parallel, passes the bits shifted in from pin 241 and stored in each of the stages of shift register 1014 into an eight-bit hold register 1018. Hold register 1018 in turn passes the received bits as signals SHFTIN[7:0] to received data terminals 524. Shift register 1014 also passes the received bits to output terminal 1011. When shift-in valid signal SIVALID goes active, and if a signal MPARCKEN is active on a parity error control bus 550, parity circuit 1020 compares the computed parity with a received parity bit on input line 1021 and drives a parity error detected signal SPIOPARERR active on packet error terminal 529 in case of errors. When clear parity error signal CLRPARERR- goes active on error control bus 550, parity circuit 1020 drives a serial port parity error signal SPIOPARERR inactive until the next parity error is detected., 305104=In one embodiment if there are any errors, sequencer 1330 sets a bit in a status register and causes command executor 1370 to turn-on LED 350 (FIG. 3)., 309175=As noted above, slave serial port input-output circuit 254 senses the presence or absence of various resources from the signals on one or more lines connected to the resource. For example, when ID-ESTAT detector 1375 senses a low signal on memory chip select line MCS# (FIG. 16), ID-ESTAT detector 1375 determines that there is no EEPROM 390 that is coupled to slave serial port input-output circuit 254. Similarly, when ID-ESTAT detector 1375 senses a high signal on SEEPROM chip select line SEECS (FIG. 16), ID-ESTAT detector 1375 determines that serial EEPROM 380 is absent. In the absence of EEPROM 390 or serial EEPROM 380, memory chips select line MCS# or serial EEPROM chip select line SEECS is coupled for example by a resistor to a first voltage e.g. high or a second voltage e.g. low respectively., 295761=One embodiment of line controller 530 (FIG. 5) includes a control enabled output driver 1210 (FIG. 12A) that is controlled by drive signal SPIODRV on drive line 531. In response to an active drive signal SPIODRV, output driver 1210 passes a serial port output signal SPIOO from serial data line 532 to pin 241. An inactive drive signal SPIODRV disables output driver 1210 and so provides a high impedance to pin 241 and input buffer 1220 passes the signal received on pin 241 as serial port input signal SPIOI to serial data line 722., 307469=In one embodiment, host adapter 240 and slave serial port input-output circuit 254 are coupled to impose a single load on system bus 250, such as a PCI bus as illustrated in FIG. 15. A reset input terminal 1501 of slave serial port input-output circuit 254 is coupled to a system bus reset line of system bus 283 that carries signal PCIRST-., 292592=If read serial port signal READSPIO is inactive, parity circuit 1020 passes a signal on input line 1021 to serial data terminal 527. Parity circuit 1020 computes the parity of the signals on input line 1021. In response to active counter-on signal CNT9, parity circuit 1020 clocks a parity bit on serial data terminal 727 based on the computed parity for the packet out parity bit. In response to an active byte sent signal BYTESENT, parity circuit 1020 clocks a stop bit on serial data terminal 527 to complete transmission of packet., 304378=In response to other command packets, sequencer 1330 transitions to the corresponding state, such as write byte wait start state 1440 eewrite-wait-low address state 1460 and eeread-wait-low address state 1470. The actions of sequencer 1330 in such states are similar to the actions described above in respect to write data bits state 1430, except that sequencer 1330 causes shift register 1310 to clock in additional address or data packets as necessary and also causes command executor 1370 to perform actions indicated by the respective command bytes such as writing or reading internal registers BRDCTL or SPIOSTAT or memories ROM or EEROM., 305673=Command executor 1370 also includes an ID-ESTAT detector 1375 that (1) receives device identification byte IDDAT from a programmable array logic, henceforth PAL, and (2) senses signals on various pins such as memory address pins MA16 and MA17 (FIG. 16) for ROM, to detect the presence or absence of various predetermined devices on support circuit 250, such as EEPROM 390, SEEPROM 380, board control logic 370, bus terminators 360 and LED 350 (FIG. 3). Any pin of slave serial port input-output circuit 254 that is normally connected to a predetermined device carries, an active signal when the predetermined device is present on support circuit 250 and an inactive signal to indicate absence of the predetermined device, as described below in reference to FIG. 16., 49818=FIG. 14 shows an illustrative state diagram for sequencer module 1330 of FIG. 13., 295579=Although one embodiment of a parity circuit 1020 is illustrated in FIGS. 10 and 11, any other parity circuit can be used in accordance with this invention., 52121=Serial port 230 interfaces with a master serial port input-output circuit 210 within host adapter 240 which controls use of various resources in support circuit 250 by various modules of data transfer circuit 220. Data transfer circuit 220 transfers data between system bus terminals 244 that are coupled to system bus 283 and input-output bus terminals 243 that are coupled to input-output bus 284. Data transfer circuit 220 has a number of modules, such as input-output bus module 221, FIFO module 222, sequencer module 223, and system bus module 225 that are all connected to each other by a data transfer bus 226 and all of which are described in, for example, copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/964,532, entitled \u201cIntelligent SCSI Bus Host Adapter Integrated Circuit\u201d, filed on Oct. 15, 1992 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,659,690, by Craig A. Stuber et al. that is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Memory module 224 is used to temporarily store various data values that are used by firmware in sequencer module 223., 303599=If sequencer 1330 receives a command byte originating from a valid command signal such as LED request signal LEDREQ or bus terminator request STPWREQ, sequencer 1330 transitions to write data bits state 1430, and causes board control register and monitoring circuitry 1374 in command executor 1370 to use bits D0 and D1 from the command byte to drive signals to the corresponding resources such as LED 350 or bus terminators 360. Simultaneously, sequencer 1330 also causes acknowledge multiplexer 1320 to transmit an acknowledge packet on pin 341. On completion of the transmission of the acknowledge packet, sequencer 1330 returns to wait-for-start state 1420., 297060=In response to an inactive status signal SSPIOCPS, line controller 530 uses two multiplexers 1230 and 1240 (FIG. 12B) and a flip-flop 1250 to switch the connection of pin 241 to either (1) drive line 531 and serial data line 532 or (2) default command bus 533 that carries bus termination signals STPWLEVEL and STPWEN, depending on whether or not status signal SSPIOCPS on default command bus 533 is active or inactive respectively, which indicates the presence or absence of a slave serial port input-output circuit. In the absence of a slave serial port input-output circuit, line controller 530 drives a first bus termination signal STPWCTL on pin 241 to control turning on or off power to bus terminators of an input-output bus as described above., 35804=This application is a continuation of application Ser.
