            "There are a lot of things to do for fun on campus. You can go to the Recreation Center where there is a pool, fitness center, and an indoor track. This is free to any student on campus. There are also many clubs and sports you can join and many activities around campus.",
            "There are many places to eat at on campus. They have a few fast food restaurants such as Popeye, Subway, and Chick-fil-a. They also have a coffee shop and a few other restaurants.",
            "The dorms are very nice. They have game rooms and a mini shop on the first floor. They also have a kitchen that residents can use. The rooms are a good size and I like how there is only one person per room and how you have a lock for your own room. The only bad thing I've noticed so far is that the walls are very thin and you can hear every noise someone will make.",
            "I've only been to this school for orientation but from what I've heard from other students you have to actually try hard to get the good grades you want.",
            "You should defiantly attend orientation and any other campus involvement activities because it's a great way to make friends and learn about all the things you can do at the school.",
            "It's a great school that has many ways to help students succeed. The students who help with orientation are helpful and nice, they make it a lot easier to get to know people and to get used to the school. I also like how they have many ways to get help or tutoring if you need it."

There are so many opportunities to get involved on campus and to make the best of your time here. I am graduating in December so it will be bittersweet!, 14775=The University of New Orleans is a great school. Since I began school in August, it has been nonstop learning and experiencing new subjects. Being a freshman in a new environment has been a quite a change, but UNO is a great school to be in a diverse environment and allows you to understand and embrace new ideas. I have learned a lot while attending here and I cannot wait to start my next semester here.}",

Big and small classes. First time independence. Tips for prospective students Check out all of your options when in comes to housing. Sometimes the Apartments are cheaper then the dorms.Take as many classes as you can, it is a great help in being able to afford school in the long run. Get the used text books and always check blackboard and your e-mail. Bang for the buck Just before I started school I was worried about how I would pay for college, during orientation we were shown how UNO students can check our financial aid. I was still worried about how I would pay for books and housing, but then I was told that I can rent books and pay for housing on my tuition, and that any remaining money would be placed in",
