The theoretical model was intended to be more rigorous than the Levine model. The Palmer & Mansoori Model (\u201cP&M Model\u201d) is presented below: \u03d5 \u03d5 0 = 1 + c m \u03d5 0 ( P - P 0 ) + c 0 \u03d5 0 ( K M - 1 ) \ufffd ( bP 1 + bP - bP 0 1 + bP 0 ) ( P & \u2003 M \u2003 Model )}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{317025=The length of the shut-in period depends upon coal diffusivity, which is typically determined by measurement of the gas volume released from freshly cut coal samples as a function of time. Diffusivity is inversely proportional to sorption time, ts, which is defined as the time required to release 63% of the gas from a coal sample maintained at constant temperature. Accordingly, the higher the diffusivity, the shorter the sorption time. Gas Institute Report GRI-97/0263 (Mavor et al. \u201cCoalbed Reservoir Gas-In-Place Analysis\u201d pg. 3.1-3.20; 1997) describes diffusivity estimate techniques. Factors affecting diffusivity include coal composition, temperature, and water content. As an alternative, the method described in Mavor, M. J. et al. \u201cMeasurement and Evaluation of Coal Sorption Isotherm Data,\u201d (SPE 20728, 65th Annual Technical Conference of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, New Orleans, La., Sep. 23-26, 1990) can be used to determine the sorption time for WAG at reservoir temperature., 615158=As discussed earlier, the water injection test conducted in FBV 5A was used to calibrate the constrained axial modulus, M, value used in the model to 397,600 psi . The sorption strain calibration is affected by the value of Poisson's Ratio, \u03bd, as will be shown in Example 3. Independent estimates of Young's Modulus, E, and Poisson's Ratio, \u03bd, for Upper Medicine River coal samples are unavailable to the inventors' knowledge. As a result, the inventors used a \u03bd value measured on San Juan Basin coal samples from SPE 39105 (Mavor et al., ibid) of 0.21, resulting in an estimate for E equal to 353,210 psi. The bulk modulus, K, calculated using Equation (16) was 202,994 psi. The rock mechanical properties, the porosity estimates and the test SPS pressures at either the reservoir pressure or the average pressure of the injection zone were used in Equation (21), resulting in a total multicomponent volumetric sorption strain difference of \u22120.001448 between the FBV 4A tests after and before CO2 injection and 0.000211 between the FBV 5 tests during and before the N2 injection., 102665=For instance, various countries, including, among others, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan have agreed to seek internal approval and adoption, within their respective jurisdictions, of the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol ensued from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in December 1997 at Kyoto, Japan. Under the Kyoto Protocol, each participant agreed in principle to \u201cimplement and/or further elaborate policies and measures in accordance with its national circumstances\u201d to, among other things, enhance energy efficiency and protect reservoirs of certain atmospheric gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol (e.g., CO2). Generally, the Kyoto Protocol addressed emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2, CH4, N2O, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). While the United States and Australia have elected not to follow the Kyoto Protocol, they tend to address greenhouse gas emissions with national programs., 104459=As discussed above, various ECBM recovery and sequestration processes have been disclosed. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,412,559 (Gunter, Mavor and Law, Jul. 2, 2002) describes a process for recovering CH4 from a coal bed and/or sequestering a SAG in a coal bed by cyclic SAG injection with intervening shut-in periods., 640694=In contrast, Palmer and Mansoori (\u201cP&M,\u201d SPE 36737 and SPE 52607, ibid) reported that E can range from 124,000 to 445,000 psi for the San Juan Basin Reservoir. The P&M data value for \u03bd was 0.39, significantly greater than the Mavor et al. data. The effect of E and \u03bd on values for M, K, 1/M, and (1\u2212K/M), used in the inventors' model, is compared for Example 1, the upper and lower limits for the P&M E range and the midpoint of the P&M E range., 107120=Gray (\u201cReservoir Engineering in Coal Seams: Part 1\u2014The Physical Process of Gas Storage and Movement in Coal Seams\u201d SPE 12514, 1987) recognized that coal permeability changes during production due to (1) phase relative permeability effects (i.e., degree of saturation affects gas and water relative permeabilities) and (2) changes in effective stress within the coal seam. Generally, Gray observed that permeability is a function of effective stress within the coal seam. So, when the coal matrix shrinks with gas desorption, a concomitant decrease in effective stress leads to increased permeability. On the other hand, when coal bed cleats close with reduced fluid pressure, a concomitant increase in effective stress leads to decreased permeability. More specifically then, Gray teaches that permeability decreases when fluid pressure is reduced (i.e., coal bed cleats close). On the other hand, he observes an opposing effect where permeability is increased when coal shrinkage occurs with gas desorption., 134401=As an alternative approach to determining reservoir permeability, among other reservoir properties, such as CBM recovery rate and % CBM that can be economically recovered, Puri in U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,273 (Mar. 26, 1996) and a 1995 conference paper by Puri et al. (\u201cA Micro-Pilot Approach to Coalbed Methane Reservoir Assessment,\u201d Intergas '95 Proceedings, University of Alabama/Tuscaloosa, pp. 265-274, May 15-19, 1995) describes a method using field data obtained from an injection flow-back test, which data, in turn, is used in a numerical reservoir simulator, along with injection data and any prior primary production data, to model the coal bed reservoir. More specifically, Puri's method is particularly suited for predicting CBM recovery rate and % CBM recovered in an ECBM recovery process. Meanwhile, the injection/flow-back test involves injecting a gaseous desorbing fluid containing at least 50% (vol.) N2 into a formation. Injection rate data is collected during the injection step. The wellbore is then shut-in and the pressure response is measured. In a subsequent flow-back step, at least a portion of the injected fluid is produced, while production rate data and produced fluid composition data are obtained. Then, the collected field data is used in conjunction with reservoir modeling techniques, preferably by history matching with a numerical reservoir simulator for modeling the formation so ECBM recovery characteristics can be determined., 571809=The first well was the FBV 4A-23-36-20 W4M (FBV 4A) well located 3 km (1.9 mi) north of Big Valley. An initial combined production/shut-in test was conducted to obtain estimates of PR, initial effective conductivities, and initial gas composition. Following these test procedures, CO2 was injected into the formation through the FBV 4A well. The well was returned to production after a soak period. PR, post-SAG effective conductivities and post-SAG gas composition estimates were determined with a second combined production/shut-in test., 137276=In fact, in 1991, Puri et al. published the theoretical relationship between Kf and Ki, which was later re-introduced in FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,273 as curve 25 (see \u201cMeasurement of Stress Dependent Permeability in Coals and its Influence on Coalbed Methane Production\u201d Paper 9142 Proceedings of the 1991 Coalbed Methane Symposium, University of Alabama/Tuscaloosa; May 13-16, 1991). The theoretical relationship is based on absolute permeability measurements performed on a coal sample maintained under uniaxial strain conditions to simulate an overburden with constant axial stress. The testing avoided relative permeability effects, as the coal sample was saturated with brine and then depleted of brine while maintaining a constant axial confining stress., 96993=Coalbed methane (CBM) has become a significant component of U.S. natural gas supplies. CBM production increased to 2.9 Bscf/day of gas supply in 1997, accounting for about 6% of total U.S. natural gas production (Stevens et al., \u201cEnhanced Coalbed Methane Recovery using CO2 Injection: Worldwide Resource and CO2 Sequestration Potential\u201d SPE 48881; 1998)., 577828=The second well was the FBV 5-23-36-20 W4M (FBV 5) located 493 m (1,617 ft) north of the FBV 4A well. Core samples, density log data and a primary production test were used to obtain Langmuir isotherm data, coal thickness, PR, effective conductivities and initial gas composition data. The well was then shut-in and then N2 (WAG) was injected. The well was shut-in and then returned to production., 613939=An estimate of the SPS porosity at initial pressure, \u03c6i, for the coal surrounding the FBV 4A well was obtained by reservoir simulation using the GEM\u2122 (Version 2002.10) CBM software available from Computer Modeling Group, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. A simulation model was constructed that honored all well test analysis results, sorption isotherm data, and gas composition data. The SPS porosity included in the simulation model was adjusted to obtain a match with water production rates. The SPS porosity and absolute permeability were constant over the short duration of the simulated production period. The resulting estimate for the FBV 4A \u03c6i was 0.002, i.e., 0.2% of the bulk volume of the reservoir., 638047=The \u03c6/\u03c6atm ratio was also used in Equation (30) to calculate Sw at 2,000 psia. Specifically, Sw at 2,000 psia was Sw-atm (0.4401) divided by \u03c6/\u03c6atm (0.7094), resulting in an estimate of 0.6203. Interpolation in Table 2 above resulted in an estimate for krg of 0.1352. Therefore, keg at 2,000 psia during injection was estimated to be about 0.513 md., 174729=\u201cAbsolute permeability\u201d (\u201cka\u201d) is the permeability that is determined when only one fluid is present in the coal. Typical commercial CBM reservoirs have an absolute permeability in the range of from about 1 to 25 md, but some CBM reservoirs may have an absolute permeability as great as about 600 md. Absolute permeability can be determined by a method like that described in Chapter 5 of Gas Research Institute Report GRI-94/0397 (Mavor, M. and Saulsberry, J. L. \u201cTesting Coalbed Methane Wells\u201d in A Guide to Coalbed Methane Reservoir Engineering March 1996).}",
