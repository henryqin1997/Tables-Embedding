Tips for prospective students Dont' let the bland website fool you! Lock Haven is really an exciting place full of great, small-town people and a high quality education. Bang for the buck I can honestly say that Lock Haven University, being one of the Pennsylvania State Schools, is one of the cheapest institutions in Pennsylvania that offers a high quality education that will help its students compete in the job market. Am enjoying being here It being summer, I cannot wait until I return for the fall. The friends I have met there",
