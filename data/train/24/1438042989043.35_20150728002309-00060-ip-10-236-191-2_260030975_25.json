After all, the average 2-year CD offers a lower yield than your run-of-the-mill online savings account these days. The fact that non-bank ATM fees fell an additional 3.95% during Q2, after declining 14% since the beginning of 2014, is certainly great news for those of us who waste a lot of money accessing our cash. While inferior to online-only savings accounts, credit union products continue to offer market-leading interest rates among branch-based institutions, providing nearly 2.5-times as much value as regional banks and more than 5.5-times the value of national banks. Student checking accounts \u2013 which have the lowest fees on the deposit market \u2013 are 71% less expensive than their cheapest general-consumer counterparts. Lower fees come at a cost, however, as the interest rates offered to students are 74% lower than those available to the general consumer population. Business checking accounts are 147% more expensive than personal online checking accounts, providing 80% lower interest rates and 50% fewer features. As a result, small business owners should gravitate to personal account options whenever possible \u2013 as is also the case with credit cards. The minimum balance required to",
