The dorms at UW Bothell are relatively new: I believe they first made them available to students during the 2009-2010 school year. I've heard great things about them, and they seem to be a great place for students to spend their first year. They're all converted apartments, so as far as I know there are private bathrooms and kitchens. This is quite a step up from traditional dorms, but is in turn a bit more expensive., 133315=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Dorm Life nb/a Academic Rigor it's a solid academic environment with heavy emphasis on research. Tips for prospective students if you attend uw bothell, be sure to take advantage of the wonderful academic support such as the writing center and library assistance. develop a relationship with each professor outside of classroom by scheduling time during their office hours. In three sentences uw bothell is a wonderful, small learning environment with supportive professors and staff. i love that there are plentiful computers around campus for student use. the library connects with the main campus of uw and provides wonderful online connection to extensive academic research!
