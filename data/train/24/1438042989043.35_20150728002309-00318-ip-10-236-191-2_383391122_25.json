Although some router cards can be removed without software preparation, it is best to shut down and remove the power from a CSC or an SFC slot before removing a card. When the new card is inserted, you can restore the power to the slot and bring up the replacement card. This section describes how to properly remove and replace CSCs and SFCs for repairs., 136289=On Cisco XR 12404 routers, which use consolidated switch fabric cards (CSFCs), you must power off the router before changing a CSFC card., 91393=Sets the configuration register to 0x2102.

For instructions to use the reload command for entering ROM Monitor bootstrap mode, see Cisco\u00a0IOS\u00a0XR ROM Monitor Guide for the Cisco\u00a0XR\u00a012000 Series Router. The reload command causes the active RP to reload the Cisco IOS\u00a0XR software according to the configuration register setting. This setting determines how the active RP acts when reloaded.",
