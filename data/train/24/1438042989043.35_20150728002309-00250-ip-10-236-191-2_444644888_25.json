            "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FUNCTIONALLY REDUNDANT COMPUTING SYSTEM HAVING A CONFIGURABLE DELAY BETWEEN LOGICALLY SYNCHRONIZED PROCESSORS - A method of operating a computer system. A first processor sends a first unit of binary information to an input/output (I/O) unit. The I/O unit then conveys the first unit of binary information to a functional unit in the computer system. A system response from the functional unit is then received by the I/O unit, which forwards the system response to the first processor. The system response is also stored in a first buffer. After a predetermined delay time has elapsed, the system response is then forwarded to the second processor.",
            "PROCESSOR TEST SYSTEM UTILIZING FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY - A system and method for testing a processor. The system includes a gold processor and a test processor, wherein the test processor is the device under test (DUT). The test processor and the gold processor are identical. A first memory is coupled to the gold processor by a first memory bus and a second memory, independent of the first, is coupled to the test processor by a second memory bus. The first and second memories are identical. A memory bus comparator coupled to the first and second memory buses compares memory bus signals generated by the gold and test processors, and selectively provide a first indication if a mismatch occurs. A peripheral bus comparator is also coupled to the gold and test processors, and compares downstream transactions generated by the gold and test processors and to provide a second indication if a peripheral bus comparison results in a mismatch."
