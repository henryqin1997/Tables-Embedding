            "Rooms are small but decent.",
            "Plan on working at it! Teachers are pretty accessible though to lend a hand.",
            "No doubt you will get a good education at Fordham. The school is highly ranked and the education is excellent. You should plan to take full advantage of the New York social scene. But, don't expect a well rounded on campus college experience because the social scene and sports enthusiasm is lacking and you really need these too to balance things out. Lets face it most schools have sports programs that are a part of the school pride and weekend activity. Fordham sports teams are just not very good so student turnout is low.",
            "Fordham is an outstanding academic school with good teachers and a supportive Dean at the Gabelli School of Business. The social scene however, is in need of an energy infusion. Without a Greek system and mediocre sports scene, most of it centers around house parties and the bar scene which can get old fast."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38590=Each freshman dorm has quite a different feel to it. Alumni court south, where i lived, seems to be the most social and community oriented dorm. The people are very friendly, and for the most part students seemed to get along. The lounge always seemed to be full, and people were very welcoming and social. The bathrooms could get pretty disgusting, and were not cleaned amazingly, but i suppose that is expected in any college dorm. The one thing i did not particularly like is the visitation policy. Any student from another dorm must be singed in after 5 PM, and cannot stay past 3:30 am otherwise the school will charge you., 59191=It seems like the school is really good! I will be attending the Lincoln Center campus. I visited the campus last April, and it is beautiful! The teachers seem really friendly and outgoing. I can't wait to have my first class on August 31st!, 223005=The dorms provide a great habitat for friend-making. They are large rooms, and although you have to share a floor bathroom, Fordham's dorms are a lot better than other colleges. Some buildings lack air conditioning, but you may only suffer through September, because the temperature is not too high for too long., 146998=The campus food at Fordham was rated the worst in 2012. However, the food outside the campus is great. There are a lot of varieties of different food/restaurants outside of the Campus., 261018=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 19018=FCLC doesn't have much of a dorm community. You probably expect a college dorm to be the kind of place where all doors are open and you can just stroll on in to any room you choose, befriend your entire floor, and squeeze in 30+ freshman into your RA's room on a Friday night to watch a movie. That's not how it's going to be at FCLC (although I can't speak for the Rose Hill campus, it may be different there). Dorms at FCLC have bathrooms, kitchens, and living rooms so there is no need to hang out in common areas or even leave your room. Doors are also expected to be locked at all times. It isn't that it's impossible to make friends at FCLC - you just have to be the kind of person who is both independent yet willing to boldy walk up to someone, shake their hand and say 'Hey, let's be friends!'. There will be a new freshman dorm built in 2014 that won't be apartment-style, so that could definetly change the whole dorm atmosphere!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I love everything about life at Fordham! To put it simply, I've never had more fun in my life than I have this past semester. Fordham's Campus Activities Board does a great job at planning exciting events and concerts on campus regularly, and there is always something going on to look forward to. Truly though, the most amazing part about Fordham is its proximity to Manhattan and the endless opportunities for entertainment that are a quick subway ride away. I can honestly say it is impossible to be bored while living here. When I want a break from the crazy city life, Fordham's campus is so calm and peaceful that I can relax by a tree and read a book or just hang out in the student center. Whether you crave the hustle and bustle of New York City life or the peace and safety of a lovely tree-filled private campus, Fordham is the place to be. Am learning a lot With the benefits of the most culturally diverse and intellectually-stimulating city in the world at your fingertips, as well as a curriculum following the Jesuit tradition of educating the whole person, Fordham University offers the best education possible. I came to college expecting to learn a bunch of facts and skills to help prepare me for medical school,",
