    "textAfterTable": "The Microsoft Rights Management (RMS) connector lets you quickly enable existing on-premises servers to use their Information Rights Management (IRM) functionality with the cloud-based Microsoft Rights Management service (Azure RMS). With this functionality, IT and users can easily protect documents and pictures both inside your organization and outside, without having to install additional infrastructure or establish trust relationships with other organizations. You can use this connector even if some of your users are connecting to online services, in a hybrid scenario. For example, some users' mailboxes use Exchange Online and some users' mailboxes use Exchange Server. After you install the RMS connector, all users can protect and consume emails and attachments by using Azure RMS, and information protection works seamlessly between the two deployment configurations. The RMS connector is a small-footprint service that you install on-premises, on servers that run Windows Server\u00a02012\u00a0R2, Windows Server\u00a02012, or Windows Server\u00a02008\u00a0R2. In addition to running the connector on physical computers, you can also run it on virtual machines, including Azure IaaS VMs. After you install and configure the connector, it acts as a communications interface (a relay) between the on-premises servers and the cloud service. If you manage your own tenant key for Azure\u00a0RMS (the bring you own key, or BYOK scenario), the RMS connector and the on-premises servers that use it do not access the hardware security module (HSM) that contains your tenant key. This is because all cryptographic operations that use the tenant key are performed",
