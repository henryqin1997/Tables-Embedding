In the Spring of 2013, Macon State will be called Middle Georgia State College. Hopefully we will have a real football team and much more! Pep Rallies will be a blast! Go Knights!, 185226=Cochran campus food was decent but this was back in 2002 when I was there. I cant speak for now. As far as the Warner Robins campus, I have used the cafe in the bookstore and I love their coffee. There is now the new cafe/lounge there too which is really nice.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck The tuition is great here. The financial aid can help you with any problems you may have. Emergency loans are given if you do not have the money right away. Am enjoying being here Everyone in Macon State are friendly and they give you tips on what classes you should take for your profession. I live in the Residence Life and it is wonderful. Other colleges have freshman sleeping in traditional dorms, but in Macon State you can live in a apartment. I have my own room and bathroom it is a great place to live in. Am learning a lot Professors are very helpful. If I am having trouble in a class, I can get a tutor or talk with my professor during their office hours. The professors want people to be successful and they want students to reach their goals.
