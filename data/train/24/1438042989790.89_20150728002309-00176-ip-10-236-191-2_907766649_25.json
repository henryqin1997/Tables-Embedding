I'm sure it is a sign of an excellent foreign exchange program, 322321=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 295165=Angelo State University is greate for students who are wanting to get away from the big city for awhile then I would most definitely recommend coming here. If you are looking for an affordable public school besides Lamar University and Tarleton State University, then I would suggest coming to ASU as well. The actual location of San Angelo may not be to your liking but I can honestly say that it is a great school filled with great opportunities and resources.}",

Tips for prospective students This school is mainly recognised in science for its biology and physics programs, not to mention pre-medicine, and they are ranked among the top in the state. The exceptions are Chemistry and Biochemistry - From the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department. All of the department professors are... hmm... let's just say they're not the best teachers and they don't really care about how much you learn, they just want to get the class over with.
