Cisco IOS XE 3.3SE This command was implemented in Cisco IOS XE Release 3.3SE. Usage Guidelines This command is available only for IP-route threshold metric objects tracked by the track ip route metric threshold command in global configuration mode. The default up and down threshold values are 254 and 255, respectively. With these values, IP-route threshold tracking gives the same result as IP-route reachability tracking.",
