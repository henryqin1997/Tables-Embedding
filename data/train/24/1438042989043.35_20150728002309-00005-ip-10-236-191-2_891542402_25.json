Vegan and vegetarian options are found everywhere and the school is very accommodating towards documented allergies. The food is edible, but don't expect high quality, 328703=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 49160=Dandelion Day is typically the last Friday in April, when the entire student body congregates on the residence quad for a carnival, celebrating the arrival of good weather, and the end of a looonnnnngggg winter., 184147=It snows from December to April. There is an underground tunnel system linking different academic buildings that you come to appreciate during the winters., 295417=If you have time to spare, then I recommend going to Danforth Dinning with is located in the Freshman building Sue Bee, Susan B. Anthony. If your in a rush, go to Douglass, or the pit, which is the basement of Common Connections. If you ever have time, which you will, I strongly recommend getting a Mel Burger which is in the Meliora Dinning Center above Douglass Dinning Center. It was annoying as a freshman that you were required to get an unlimited dinning plan because it was expensive and had little declining. However, this upcoming year 2013-2014 should offer a new plan for freshman which offers so many meals a semester and more declining. I would recommend getting one of those plans rather than the unlimited since you get to choose what you want., 211329=Engineering--the school is one of the top for engineering--and anyone who wants to do research. It's in the top 40 in research universities. There is a med school, so students who want to be medical professionals are also perfect. The Sign Language program is amazing, taught by deaf teachers. Rochester has a 1:7 deaf to hearing ratio., 103354=Hey! The University was ranked sixth (6th) by the Daily Meal in their 75 Best Colleges for Food in America for 2014., 105285=The University of Rochester is one of the nation's leading higher education. With a faculty to student ratio of 9:1, students are assured that they will receive the attention necessary for them to succeed throughout their years here at the U of R. Class size are typically 10-25 students, but in the sciences and math, it tend to be pretty large. But wait, don't be scared, workshops or professor/teacher assistant office hours are offered for to students sitting in these classes. In writing classes, there are also writing fellows and consultants at your service. If interested, I would advice a prospective student to do intensive research about the university. Meliora.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The students and the faculty are great. There is always someone to help you at the University of Rochester with academics. Plus there are literally hundreds of clubs that you can join. These range from cooking clubs to community service clubs to the juggling club and club sports and if we're missing a club that you want it is very simple to create one. In addition there are Varsity sports teams that you can participate in, a cappella groups to sing in and join, and even different interest floors and special housing so that you can share your interests with the people you live with. UR has everything that a college student needs. We have our own bank, buses, car rental, candy store, grocery store, and even a hair and nail salon! UR is perfect for every interest and need. Am learning a lot The University of Rochester offers a unique curriculum that allows students to explore their different interests. Instead of wasting time on General Education Requirements UR gives students the freedom to find what really interests them and what they want to do with their lives. The University of Rochester uses a cluster system instead of General Education Requirements. Basically, every student has to take a cluster of at least three classes in three different general disciplines:",
