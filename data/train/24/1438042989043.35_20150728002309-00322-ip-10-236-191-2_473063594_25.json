our independent registered public accountants\u0092 audit staff, however, during this time we consistently experienced a lack of complete preparedness. \u00a0As such, we believe that this material weakness had not been remediated as of the end of the period covered by this report. \u00a0Inasmuch as this deficiency is related to our lack of adequate staffing, which is a condition which our size prohibits us from remediating, we do not know if we will be able to remediate this weakness in the foreseeable future. \u00a0\u00a0We will continue to review our procedures, and to make changes wherever practicable which will assist in remediating this deficiency., 156042=100,667 shares of our common stock to an accredited investor pursuant to the conversion on January 30, 2012 of $3,020 in

pursuant to the $39,584 in principal amount of the 10% senior convertible note, which was issued December 31, 2011;, 235282=In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,

interest to the date of prepayment. \u00a0The holder has the option to convert any balance of principal and interest which is unpaid at June 8, 2012 or thereafter, into common stock of the Corporation. \u00a0The rate of conversion is to be calculated as the average of the lowest three trading prices during the ten day period immediately preceding such conversion, discounted by 42%. \u00a0\u00a0, 1014317=The discount to market conversion feature of the convertible promissory notes causes a theoretical possibility that the Corporation may be required to settle the notes by issuing more shares than are authorized. \u00a0Furthermore, this feature causes the notes to fall within the FAS 133 definition of a derivative liability. \u00a0Management has calculated that the maximum number of shares required to convert the principal plus accrued interest on the convertible notes at December 31, 2011 was 10,565,420, which represents less than 1% of the authorized, unissued shares at that date, and has also estimated that the fair value of the notes at December 31, 2011 approximates face value, therefore no adjustment for fair value restatement has been made., 162010=The selected financial data set forth below with respect to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for each of the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and with respect to the

December 31, 2010. \u00a0We also issued a bonus in the form of 1,000,000 common shares, to a consultant, which resulted in a further $18,300 in remuneration expense for which there was no comparable cost during the year ended December 31, 2010. \u00a0The increase in fees associated with these contracts was partially offset by a decrease in both marketing and administration remuneration, as a result of the termination of two consulting contracts in September 2011, and by a reduction in audit and related fees., 1137550=The following table sets forth certain information concerning our director and executive officer as of December 31, 2010:, 1128336=Based on its evaluation under the framework in Internal Control\u00a0\u0097 Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our
