A nine-play drive that covered 51 yards was capped on a Hanson 47-yard field goal through the uprights with 5:12 to play in the first. The big play of the drive was also the first play of the drive as Stafford connected with Johnson on a 21- yard catch-and-run., 53244=On a methodical 10-play drive that took a bit over five minutes and covered 65 yards, the Saints made it a 21-10 game as Brees again used play action, rolled out to the right and threw a soft toss to Shockey, who caught the ball from a yard out with 3:45 left in the first half., 53535=New Orleans held Detroit on the next touch and quickly marched down the field to score again. A four-play drive that covered 59 yards was capped on a leaping 15-yard catch in the back of the end zone by Shockey for a 28-10 lead with 1:10 to play until the break., 50941=Detroit was able to answer with a 24-yard field goal from Jason Hanson to again make it an 11-point game, but, on the first play after getting the ball back, Brees hit Henderson over the middle and the receiver took it into the end zone from 58 yards out for a 38-20 lead with 3:03 to play in the third., 51496=The Saints, though, essentially sealed the win on their next possession as a drive that spanned the third and fourth quarters and lasted 13 plays was finished when Brees found Heath Evans in the end zone from 13 yards out for a 45-27 lead with 8:29 to play., 51257=Stafford was intercepted by Scott Shanle on the Lions' next touch, but Bell fumbled the ball on the next snap and Louis Delmas rumbled into the end zone from 65 yards out to make it a 38-27 game with 1:29 to play in the third., 52101=After holding Detroit to a three-and-out, the Saints again got good field position thanks to a 28-yard punt. On the third play, Brees used a play action fake and hit Meachem wide open in the end zone on a 39-yard score for a 14-0 lead with 9:34 to play in the first., 48775=Brees, the 2008 offensive player of the year, went 26-for-34 with 358 yards and a pick for the Saints (1-0), who finished last season 8-8. Brees threw for 5,069 yards last season and fell just 15 yards shy of Dan Marino's record for a single season.}",
