            "Students looking for a traditional college experience while engaging in top ranked programs. (Fashion, Nursing, Aeronautics)",
            "There's usually always something going on on campus that's free and interesting. Off campus, there's not much to do for the under 21 crowd, other than go to frat parties or the movies. A 20 minute drive to Akron is the closest dance clubs.",
            "Kent State's campus serves a lot of students, so there are tons of places to eat. However, most students eat at the same couple of spots. The Hub is nice but serves mostly fast food, similar to a mall food court. Eastway and Prentice are traditional college cafeterias that serve a variety of foods each week. These two locations also have markets, where students can purchase groceries on their meal plan. Rosie's is diner-style with a market similar to Eastway and Prentice. Also in the student center are the Kent Markets which serve pretty good food. In the lower floor of the student center is a Quaker Steak and Lube which is a full service restaurant, that serves really good food but can be a little pricey.",
            "Living in the residences halls as a freshman is definitely important. Some of the halls own campus are nicer than others, so definitely do your research before applying for housing. All hall put on events at least once a week that are generally interesting and will have free food. Definitely an easy way to meet people, but try to do it early on in the year.",
            "This is 100% dependent on your major, but college is definitely a change is level of schoolwork for everyone. If you manage your time well and don't procrastinate, you can usually have a life outside of school.",
            "Come here for your program. Knowing your major will help you get out of here on time. Also try to get AP or post secondary credit that will transfer so you can get out of usually boring core classes.",
            "Kent is a good school with lots to do and many opportunities. But it is a very large school which comes with it's own set of problems."

After May 4, safety is a top priority., 852539=Kent State University has something called black squirrels and the black squirrel festival. In February 1961, Lary Woodell brought a pair of 2 black squirrels to Kent from Canada. You won't find black squirrels anywhere else. The black squirrel is now known as the unofficial mascot of Kent State., 204422=Black squirrels basically run the campus, ever since a few were brought here in 1961 and heavily populated the area. The Black Squirrel is now our unofficial mascot., 790965=Be prepared for a hectic Halloween and a solemn May 4th., 860489=The May Fourth Memorial is great for a walk!, 583297=Every year in October there is the Black Squirrel Festival to celebrate Kent, Ohio's unique population of black squirrels. There is live music and many booths promoting different clubs and selling interesting items., 986622=If you are unaware, Kent state was the victim of a tragedy where the military opened fire on students protesting on May 4th, 1970, which some say ultimately led to the downfall of the Nixon administration and Watergate. There is a memorial and visitor center located at the scene of the incident on campus for anyone to visit, and each year on May 4th, they have a ceremony to honor those who died., 820637=There is a tradition of remembering the May 4th tragedy that happened on campus in 1970. There are also some beautiful landscapes through out campus. The sports teams also have a tradition with Akron University that is called the Wagon wheel Challenge. The two universities compete in all different sports with one another to get the most points and whoever wins gets the wagon wheel., 936529=The walls here at Kent State are way too thin and I can here every single thing my neighbors whisper. It tends to get very out of hand sometimes when I am trying to study, and the campus is too big to just get up and walking to the library at 10 o'clock at night., 299590=There is one location on campus that put Kent State on the map and a historical land mark. The May 4th memorial. In 1970, there was a protest at the now called May 4th park, where the U.S. shot at students. Four people ended up being killed. There are spots at the May 4th parking lot where they had died. Also every May 4th the parking lot is closed in remembrance of the tragedy., 930926=Black squirrels galore! Also in remembrance for those who lost their lives in the Kent State Shooting, we have a time of silence, no class on that day. It usually falls the week before or during finals (May 4th). There is a lot to learn about that day and it is nice to be able to learn about it., 903630=The campus is huge, bring good shoes. If you wait for the bus in December, you might get frostbite. The library has everything, I live here most of the time., 571210=The May 4th Memorial is a big deal on campus, it is a very respected piece of the campus. We cherish our history and hold it close to our hearts., 631574=There are a few traditions/events which happen in the month of May to reflect on the tragedy which happened with the National Guard shooting at Kent State on May 4th 1970., 880208=There is the black squirrel festival and there is a memorial for the four people that was shot and killed in 1970 by the Natitional guard, 333977=My favorite spot on campus is the May 4th memorial next to Taylor Hall, my friends and I spend a lot of time there at night sitting and talking., 515395=The May 4th memorial that commemorates the Kent State shooting, 892671=May 4th memorial activities to honor those lost during the tragic incident., 327394=Perhaps most infamously known for the May Fourth shootings, KSU holds a memorial service every year on that day to remember that catastrophic event, with guest speakers, a candlelit ceremony, and a day of remembrance to honor those who were lost., 994425=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 251742=In previous years Kent State University tried to sweep the events of May 4th 1970 under wraps. The Kent State Shootings are a grim legacy, though in the past ten years or so Kent has been properly respecting the lives lost on that day., 362177=There is college fest that we have and May 4 is a big day at Kent State as well., 287379=May 4th memorial, great trees., 3890=Tuition fees are reasonable. But room and board is EXPENSIVE, and fees are suppose to rise for Fall 2011 Semester. If you can, find an apartment or you could even rent out a room. But I do suggest that Freshman live in dorms, it gives you a chance to make friends and who knows they might even become your roommate.}",

When internship/ scholarship time comes around it'll give you an advantage among others. It also increases your chance of finding a student job on campus. Go to class some professors are sneaky & love the pop quizzes, and just have fun! College will be best time of your life. Bang for the buck Tuition fees are reasonable.

There's so much too do and so many other students with interests like yours. There's groups for everything from a Zoology Conservation Club to Aviation Clubs. And not to mention Halloween and St. Patrick's Day, its CRAZY! Theres tons of fun to release the stressful homework load off, but stay FOCUSED. Am learning a lot I'm currently majoring in Zoology, the professors are well",
