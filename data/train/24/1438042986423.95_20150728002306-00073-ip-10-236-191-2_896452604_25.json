    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here How can you not? Its south Florida! the campus is small and beautiful with trees providing shade and ponds that add to the open, fresh, and invigorating sense of the campus. The people are friendly and you will meet students from all over the world, STU prides itself on its diversity. Am learning a lot Professors are great. Whats best is the same class sizes; they allow for a more personalized education. Plenty of areas of study to choose from, however, the classes in less demand are on rotation so you might have to wait a semester to take a class you want. On the bright side, if the class you need is not being offered faculty are so nice and willing to work with you.
