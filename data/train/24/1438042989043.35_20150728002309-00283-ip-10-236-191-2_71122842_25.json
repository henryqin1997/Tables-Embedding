PlsqlInfoLogging The character set in use is multi-byte, and you want to compensate for the problem of get_page or get_page_raw fetching fewer bytes for each row. Calculations in the PL/SQL Web ToolKit are character-based and in the case of multi-byte characters, OWA packages assume a worst-case character byte size and do not attempt to pack each row to its maximum. The average response page is large and you want to reduce the number of round-trips the mod_plsql module makes to the database to fetch the response.
