In this example, receiving (464) a key phrase (516) is carried out by use of a Voice Over Internet Protocol (\u201cVOIP\u201d) link (130) that carries the speech of at least one user (124) from the user's client device to a voice response server (104). A VOIP link is a kind of computer hardware and software that uses an internet protocol network instead of a traditional telephone network as the transmission medium for speech. VOIP is sometimes referred to as \u2018IP telephony\u2019 or \u2018Voice Over the Internet\u2019 (\u201cVOI\u201d). Examples of user client devices include any computer equipment capable of converting input speech to digital data and transmitting it over the internet protocol to a voice response server, including handheld wireless devices, personal digital assistants, personal computers, laptop computers, and the like.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38480=This application is a continuation application of and claims priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/887,516, filed on Jul. 8, 2004., 39952=Methods, systems, and products are disclosed that operate generally to support improved multimedia presentations by creating a presentation document that includes a content-specific presentation grammar and a structured document. The structured document typically has structural elements such as pages, paragraphs, cells, titles, and the like marked with structural identifiers. A content-specific presentation grammar ties presentation actions to the document structure through these structural element identifiers. A presentation actions directs the presentation of a document such as by moving the presentation to the next page of the document, the previous paragraph of the document and so on. A presentation grammar empowers a presenter to invoke the presentation actions using speech., 185350=Amending the session document also includes adding to the session grammar of the session document a new grammar element from the presentation grammar. There were no bullets in the session structured document before the exemplary user profile event and therefore no grammar elements supporting presentation control instructions for bullets. Adding the marketing paragraph also added bullets, so the method advantageously includes adding grammar elements supporting presentation control instructions for bullets:, 213183=This example of presenting (454) a selected structural element (456) to a user (124) is expressed in terms of HTML and HTTP, a stateless, asynchronous protocol. Many embodiments will statefully hold open a data communications connection, such as a TCP/IP connection, between a presentation server and a user client device. A Stateful Java Enterprise Session Bean\u2122 may be used, for example, to hold open a TCP/IP connection implemented with a Java socket object. Readers of skill in the art will recognize therefore that HTML and HTTP are used for explanation, not for limitation. In fact, any presentation application using any appropriate data communications protocol useful for multi-media presentations may be used to present structural elements to users according to embodiments of the present invention. Such application may be obtained off-the-shelf commercially or they may be specially developed for particular presentations or kinds of presentation. An example of such an application available commercially is Microsoft NetMeeting\u2122. Examples of other data communications protocols useful with various embodiments of the present invention include the Session Initiation Protocol specified in the IETF's RFC 2543, the Real Time Streaming Protocol as specified in the IETF's RFC 2326, the Real Time Transport Protocol of RFC 1889, and the World Wide Web Consortium's VoiceXML protocol specified in the 2003 document entitled \u201cVoice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.0\u201d., 41959=More particularly, methods, systems, and computer program products are disclosed for differential dynamic content delivery. Typical embodiments include providing a session document for a presentation, wherein the session document includes a session grammar and a session structured document; identifying a recording period within a presentation session; recording, during the recording period, a presentation control instruction; selecting from the session structured document a classified structural element in dependence upon the recorded presentation control instruction and in dependence upon user classifications of a user participant in the presentation; and presenting the selected structural element to the user., 149458=In this example, an audience of users identified for a presentation include users having in their user profiles user classifications indicating technical level \u20182\u2019 and membership in IBM. None of the registered users have security authorizations and none of them are from the marketing department. Filtering this exemplary presentation document, extracting structural elements with classification identifiers corresponding to the user classifications, writing those structural elements to a session document, and filtering the presentation grammar in dependence upon the extracted structural elements, results in the following exemplary session document:, 127034=In such an exemplary embodiment, retrieving (368) a presentation grammar is carried out by requesting the presentation grammar (120) from the content server (106), including communicating the presentation document name as a request parameter; and receiving the presentation grammar (120) in response from the content server (106). In an example where the presentation document is located according to a URI as described above and the content server is implemented with a web server, requesting the presentation grammar (120) from the content server (106), including communicating the presentation document name as a request parameter, may be carried out by parsing the URI into an HTTP GET message:, 155109=In the resulting session document, the structural element identified as page 2 now excludes versions for security level 2 and for marketing, because none of the users listed for the presentation are in the marketing department or have security authorizations of level 2. In addition, the session grammar excludes a grammar element for bullets because, in the session document above, the only structural element having bullets was the version of paragraph 2 for the marketing department. Excluding the bullets as structural elements in the session structured document means that there is no need to have grammar elements for them in the session grammar. Reducing the number of grammar elements in the session grammar reduces the number of grammar elements in the voice response grammar, thereby increasing the efficiency and accuracy of the voice response server and the overall presentation system., 123421=In such an exemplary embodiment, retrieving (368) a presentation grammar is carried out by requesting the presentation grammar (120) from the content server (106), including communicating the presentation document name as a request parameter; and receiving the presentation grammar (120) in response from the content server (106). In an example where the presentation document is located according to a URI as described above and the content server is implemented with a web server, requesting the presentation grammar (120) from the content server (106), including communicating the presentation document name as a request parameter, may be carried out by parsing the URI into an HTTP GET message:, 44276=Typical embodiments also include creating a session document from a presentation document, including: identifying a presentation document for a presentation, the presentation document including a presentation grammar and a structured document having structural elements classified with classification identifiers; identifying a user participant for the presentation, the user having a user profile comprising user classifications; and filtering the structured document in dependence upon the user classifications and the classification identifiers. Many such embodiments also include creating a presentation document, including: creating, in dependence upon an original document, a structured document comprising one or more structural elements; classifying a structural element of the structured document according to a presentation attribute; and creating a presentation grammar for the structured document, wherein the presentation grammar for the structured document includes grammar elements each of which includes an identifier for at least one structural element of the structured document., 43400=Typical embodiments include creating the presentation control instruction, including receiving from a user participating in the presentation a key phrase and optional parameters for invoking a presentation action; and parsing the key phrase and parameters against a voice response grammar into a presentation control instruction. In many embodiments, the recorded presentation control instruction includes a presentation action identifier and optional parameters; and selecting a classified structural element includes selecting a classified structural element in dependence upon the presentation action identifier and the parameters. In typical embodiments, selecting a classified structural element includes selecting a classified structural element having an associated classification identifier that corresponds to the user classification.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets It will be understood from the foregoing description that modifications and changes may be made in various embodiments of the present invention without departing from its true spirit. The descriptions in this specification are for purposes of illustration only and are not to be construed in a limiting sense. The scope of the present invention is limited only by the language of the following claims. , presenting (454) a selected structural element (456) to a user includes transcoding (580) the recorded presentation control instruction (471) in dependence upon the display device type (582) and sending (576) the selected structural element (456) to a display device (579) at a display device location (581). Transcoding is converting content, in this example a selected structural element, in one format to another format, such as, for example, converting a media file or object from one format to another. Transcoding is often used to convert video formats, VHS to QuickTime, QuickTime to MPEG, and so on. Transcoding is also used to fit HTML files and graphics files to the constraints of mobile devices, Web-enabled products, hand-helds, small-format wireless devices, and the like. Such devices often have relatively small screen sizes, lower memory, and smaller bandwidths. In this example, transcoding (580) is carried out by receiving a selected structural element adapting it to a particular display device (579) described (582) in a user's profile (126). FIG. 23",
