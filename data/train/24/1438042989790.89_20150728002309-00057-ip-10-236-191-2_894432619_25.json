We had wale ludacris and Sammy adams, 256721=Uhart has dining open from 7am to 1:30 am, ranging from buffet style eateries, diner, Taco Bell, Starbucks, a deli, and even an on campus grocery store., 36253=It's a lot of work to be a music theatre major at the Hartt School. Our classes start at 8:30 in the morning, and go pretty consistently through the day until 3:00pm or so. We do not have a typical college experience. As a sophomore, I have six dance classes a week, classes in acting, voice and speech, music theatre history, and individual vocal lessons and coachings. It's a lot of work, but they certainly push us here. And in order to succeed in such a competitive business, it's a good thing they don't let up on us., 282259=The only reason it gets one star is because pita wraps at Gengras are pretty good. Overall, the hours are terrible -- Gengras and Einstein Bagels close on weekends, and Commons closes at 6:30 pm on weekends. The food makes you sick and is really gross. A lot of it is fast food, too., 194839=Living in B-Complex is literally PERFECT! I'm right in the center of things, and since I work on-campus through Aramark in Commons, I live right beside my job! The dorms are really nice-- I happen to live in a large room with one roommate; my dorm used to be a common room! Most people are generally respectful of noise-- but you'll always get a few rotten, probably intoxicated eggs screaming at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're trying to sleep for a 9 o'clock class! Residence Assistants live on every other floor and make rounds frequently and are always there to help and are fun to talk to! There are several upperclassman housing options to choose from; Park River, Regents, and The Village apartments. All of them are really nice, but if you want to cook more for yourself or have parties, Regents and The Village (respectively) are perfect for that!, 364163=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 283747=Stay away from the burritos at Commons, bring breakfast foods for weekends because they don't serve real food until 11:30 am, and stay away from the bridge at night unless you want to smell marijuana. Take advantage of the shuttle off-campus because they don't run often, and it's nice to get off campus., 94885=Make sure you check the weather when you park your car, lots of the parking lots are in a flood zone. In September 2011 there was a huge flood ruining hundreds of car., 824=Definitely apply for Hawk Hall. It was the only place remotely worth living for the cost of housing. If you are able to afford the $500 per semester to bring you car on campus do it. The only place worth eating is Montague's deli, which I believe will be gone now. Commons has good breakfast on weekends, but it doesn't open until 11:30. Hawk's Nest is tasty but not healthy at all! And Gengras Cafe is decent, but I could never manage to keep it under the meal equivalency price., 89971=Public safety is responsible for watching the river to ensure that students are alerted that it may overflow and flood the parking lots. The place where the river overflows is directly next to the Public Safety building. HOWEVER, they failed to notice or inform students when the river flooded those lots in September 2011. If they couldn't watch the water level of a river, what does that say about their competence and ability to keep the campus safe?, 258474=Fall 2013 I will be a junior at UHart. I think the school is amazing and has a lot to offer: athletics, tons of eateries, off campus shuttling, jobs, parties, fun, and everything else in between!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck It was definitely not worth all the frustration that comes with arrogant students and ill-mannered faculty. Not to mention that I learned next to nothing in my classes. I felt like I did the minimal work required and still finished with an A in every class, even when I was out for a month and a half. The University is overpriced, especially when you consider that you're living in a cinderblock room with a tile floor for $42,000 a year. Did enjoy being here There are not any events set up by the school or any groups / clubs of the school on the weekends. There is really nothing to do if you're not a big drinker and you don't have a car to get off campus. There are buses that will take you off campus on the weekends, but the last bus runs at about 7 p.m. You can take a taxi, but they're very overpriced and get expensive after awhile especially after a night of shopping at the mall. A good deal of the student body comes from much more privileged families than I did and they came off as insolent. There are a few in particular that I can remember such as the guy who threw his $400 Blackberry on the floor and remarked that the next day",
