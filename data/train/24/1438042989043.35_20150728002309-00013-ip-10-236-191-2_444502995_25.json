            "DYNAMIC LEARNING IN REDESIGNING A COMPOSITION OF WEB SERVICES - Business processes are constructed and/or modified utilizing system knowledge including a folksonomy that stores information regarding a group of services usable by composition applications that collects system monitored services usage information and user inputs. In one aspect, candidate services are recommended and/or automatically updated/replaced, which can implement aspects of a business process from the group of services based upon information derived from the system knowledge. In another aspect, a composition design component interacts with a user to build and/or modify services based upon identified aspect of business processes to be implemented by services, wherein the component design component recommends candidate services that can implement the aspects of the business processes from the group of services based upon information derived from the system knowledge.",
            "TOOLING FOR IMPLEMENTING BUSINESS PROCESSES USING WEB SERVICES - Business processes are implemented using a collection component for storing system knowledge comprising usage history and user input relative to activities within community of users, where the system knowledge comprises at least a folksonomy. At least one of a user client component interacts with the data collection component to enable a corresponding user to contribute user-derived information to the folksonomy and a monitoring component monitors activities associated with the community of users and interacts with the data collection component to contribute usage information to the system knowledge. Still further, a composition design application interacts with a user to build and/or modify processes built using services, wherein the composition design application recommends candidate services that can implement aspects of the business processes based upon information derived from the system knowledge."

    "textAfterTable": "John Franklin Miller, Durham, NC US Patent application number Description Published 20090042973 Inhibitors of aspartyl protease - The present invention relates to a novel class of sulfonamides which are aspartyl protease inhibitors. In one embodiment, this invention relates to a novel class of HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors characterized by specific structural and physicochemical features. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are particularly well suited for inhibiting HIV-1 and HIV-2 protease activity and consequently, may be advantageously used as anti-viral agents against the HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses. This invention also relates to methods for inhibiting the activity of HIV aspartyl protease using the compounds of this invention and methods for screening compounds for anti-HIV activity. 02-12-2009 20090274650 INHIBITORS OF ASPARTYL PROTEASE - The present invention relates to a novel class of sulfonamides which are aspartyl protease inhibitors.
