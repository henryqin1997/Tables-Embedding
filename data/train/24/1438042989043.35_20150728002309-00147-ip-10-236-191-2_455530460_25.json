Financial Analysts Journal, 30:48-54., 380451=loglikelihood = -2149.602, 18157=Many of the larger CPIS reporters are euro area countries, and in large part, the substantial increases in holdings of foreign bonds for euro area investors reflects expansion into holdings of securities issued by other countries that are also in the euro area. This factor also accounts for the relatively small share held in U.S. securities for some euro area countries - for example, for Germany in 2006, U.S. bonds made up only 8 percent of all foreign long-term debt securities held by German investors, whereas bonds issued by other euro-area countries made up nearly 70 percent. Table 1b shows same data as Table 1a, but aggregates foreign holdings of all reporting euro-area countries, and excludes intra-euro area holdings. In this presentation the euro area in aggregate is now the largest holder of long-term debt foreign securities (excluding reserve holdings), even when intra-euro area securities are excluded. U.S. securities make up a larger share of the foreign portfolio of the euro area aggregate portfolio, but they are still less than a third of all foreign debt held by euro area investors, (and in fact the share in 2006 is slightly less than the share in 2001).

Total reserve holdings and reserve holdings in U.S. debt securities also increased over this period, but here the share held in U.S. debt securities declined somewhat to about 0.5 by 2006., 390863=N = 1519, 73199=What do these results suggest about \"room\" in foreign portfolios for additional holdings of U.S. securities required to finance projected U.S. external deficits? Using long-run projections of a detailed partial-equilibrium model of the U.S. balance of payments, Bertaut, Kamin, and Thomas (2008) show that under plausible assumptions, the U.S. current account balance will widen further to a little more than 6 percent of GDP by 2020 and the U.S. NIIP will deteriorate further to roughly 60 percent of GDP. They estimate that financing these cumulated deficits would require foreign investors to acquire roughly $26 trillion in additional holdings of U.S. securities over this period, with the result that their holdings of U.S. securities would increase from $8.5 trillion at end-2006 to more than $34 trillion by 2020.31 Based on fairly modest assumptions of growth in relative market capitalization (assuming U.S. and foreign market cap grow at the respective rates of their nominal GDP), the share of U.S. securities in foreign portfolios would grow from an estimated 0.12 in 2006 to roughly 0.18 by 2020, and the relative portfolio weight in U.S. securities would grow from 0.30 to roughly 0.55 over the same period, an increase they note is substantial but still implies that foreigners would remain underweight in U.S. assets., 355115=Emerging market country market capitalization and emerging market securities portfolios grow 8.3 percent on average. Industrial country market capitalization and total securities portfolios grow 5.3 percent on average Emerging market investors hold 15 percent of their total portfolio in U.S. securities (share held in 2006-2007) Industrial country investors hold 7.5 percent of their total portfolio in U.S. securities (share held in 2006-2007) Official investors acquire residual amount of U.S. securities necessary to finance the current account deficit., 87752=Lane, P.

A Global Perspective on External Poistions., 189856=Log likelihood = -1574.661 N = 1660, 32534=Figure 5 shows the relative portfolio weights in all foreign equities (the horizontal axis) and in U.S. equities (the vertical axis) for several CPIS reporting countries (the euro area countries are shown in aggregate) in 2001 and 2006. The arrows show the change in these weights over the five-year period. Note the scales on both the horizontal and vertical axes: all values shown are less than 1, indicating that the countries shown have less than the ICAPM portfolio weight in foreign equity (that is, they have \"home bias\"). They also have less than the ICAPM weight in U.S. equity. The diagonal line indicates portfolios where the portfolio allocation to U.S. equity, though it may be less than the ICAPM weight, is at least as great as the portfolio allocation to foreign equity in general. Points below the diagonal line indicate portfolios that are more biased against U.S. equity than they are against foreign equity in general, whereas points above the diagonal line indicate portfolios in which U.S. equities are relatively favored, compared with foreign equity in general. Overall, the chart suggests that many foreign portfolios - especially European portfolios - tend to be disproportionably weighted against U.S. equity: more of these country portfolios lie below the 45 degree line than above, and for no country does the weight in U.S. equity seem to be unduly large relative to total foreign exposure.15, 74621=We extend the analysis of Bertaut, Kamin, and Thomas to consider what an aggregate foreign portfolio weight of 0.55 in U.S. securities might mean for foreign industrial, emerging market, and official portfolios. As discussed above, foreign private industrial country investors have tended to be more underweight in U.S. securities than they are in all foreign securities, but their total holdings of U.S. securities are considerably larger and their portfolio acquisitions have accounted for a larger fraction of financial inflows into U.S. securities. Private emerging market country investors tend to have somewhat higher U.S. exposures (relative to their total holdings of foreign securities), but their total holdings of U.S. securities only account for about 20 percent of total foreign holdings. Although a full examination of potential portfolio shifts is beyond the scope of this paper, we can present some scenarios of different market capitalization and portfolio growth rates to consider how plausible the resulting portfolio combinations are, given the assumption that foreign investors would need to acquire $26 billion in additional U.S. securities by 2020., 83420=Aggarwal, R., L.

As of December 2006, U.S. holdings of equity issued in Caribbean financial centers (the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Panama) were $439 billion, accounting for about 10 percent of all foreign equity held by U.S. investors. These financial center holdings raise a problem of interpretation: U.S. investors may not think of these securities as foreign securities, because they trade in dollars on U.S. exchanges and are often issued by firms that in many respects behave like U.S. firms. Although we do not know the extent to which holdings of Caribbean center equity for other CPIS-reporting countries similarly reflects holdings of equities of reincorporated multinationals, we suspect that at least some are similarly affected: total holdings of Bermudan equity in December 2006 by CPIS countries other than the United States amounted to over $150 billion, whereas market capitalization of Bermuda (which excludes such reincorporates) was estimated at only about $2 billion (Standard and Poor's Global market Factbook). If we include reported holdings of Caribbean financial center equity with U.S. equity as an \"upper bound\" to what may be thought of as equity of \"U.S.\" firms, estimated foreign holdings of \"U.S.\" equity are increased by $535 billion, or by about 20 percent. Almost half of this increase is due to Caribbean holdings attributed to Hong Kong; for the other CPIS countries the addition has a much smaller effect. But even when we add in Caribbean equity, U.S. holdings are less than half for most countries; for the euro area aggregate, U.S. and Caribbean financial center equity together still account for less than 10 percent of the foreign portfolio.\u00a0Return to text, 19558=Tables 3a and 3b show similar information from the 2001 and 2006 CPIS for holdings of foreign equity. As 3a clearly illustrates, the United States is by far largest holder of foreign equities, with holdings at year-end 2006 measured at $4.3 trillion. Holdings of U.S. equities by other foreign countries are relatively modest, amounting to $2.1 trillion in aggregate, less than a fourth of their total holdings of foreign equities and only about half for Canada and Australia.11, 274698=loglikelihood = -1647.017 N = 1636, 86967=Kang, J. and R. Stulz, 1997. Why is there a home bias? An analysis of foreign portfolio equity ownership in Japan. Journal of Financial Economics, 46:3-28, 70466=Columns 8-11 in Table 11 present results from the same probit regressions, but here the samples exclude investor-destination pairs where the actual portfolio weights in 2001 and 2006 were both 0, so that we only examine portfolio combinations that increased or decreased. Trade (or distance) remains an important determinant for a relative increase in portfolio weight, though common language enters with a significant negative coefficient in the equity regression. Credit rating now has a larger negative and quite significant coefficient in both the equity and bond regressions, whereas the change in credit rating enters with a sizable positive coefficient in both equations, though it is significant only in the equity regression. This finding is robust to alternative specifications substituting internet access or \"doing business\" ranking for credit rating. Interpreting these coefficients is tricky, as the full sample results (as well as the tobit results presented in Tables 5 and 6) clearly indicate that credit risk does matter for portfolio allocations. Instead, these results suggest that when we exclude country pairs with no investment in either year (typically, in destination countries with the lowest credit ratings), investor countries were then somewhat more likely between 2001 and 2006 to increase their shares (relative to the rest of their foreign portfolio) into securities issued by those countries whose credit ratings increased over the period, rather than those with the highest ratings., 238948=loglikelihood = -1725.089 N = 1711, 228698=Log likelihood = -2116.248 N = 1618, 85276=Coval, J. and T.

The IMF's projection of the U.S. current account deficit for 2008 is somewhat smaller at $615 billion but is projected to increase by 2013 to about $675 billion (as of the April 2008 World Economic Outlook).\u00a0Return to text, 26880=Because the share of a given investor country's portfolio allocated to a given destination country's securities will change as the market value of the securities held is altered by exchange rate movements, asset price changes, and growth in market capitalization, it is useful to compare holdings to shares in market capitalization, which are similarly affected. Figure 4 shows how global market cap shares of equities and bonds have changed over the period 2001 to 2006. The U.S. market cap share has declined from nearly 50 percent in 2001 to 36 percent in 2005 for equities, and from 45 percent to 39 percent for bonds. At the same time, the euro area share was unchanged for equities but has increased from 22 percent to 28 percent for bonds. In part, the declining market cap share for the United States reflects the depreciation of the dollar over this period, while the increased shares for the euro area (for bonds) also reflects the sizable growth in the euro-area securities markets., 88653=Obstfeld, M., and K.

Likewise, the weight in U.S. securities generally - but not always - increased. To put portfolio changes on a more equal basis, we compute, for each investor country, the total change in portfolio weight for equities and for bonds between 2001 and 2006 (these changes correspond to the movements along the horizontal axis in Figures 6 and 7). Then, for each investor country, we compute the change in the portfolio weight for each destination country relative to the investor country's total change in foreign weight. This specification allows us to put allocation changes for an investor country such as France (where the change in total foreign equity weight was +.116) on an equal footing with those of an investor country such as the Czech Republic (where the change in total foreign equity weight was .04)., 264332=N = 1644, 452719=17.\u00a0\u00a0In related research using the 1997 and 2001 CPIS, Berkel (2007) finds a \"friendship bias\" in equity portfolios of some country pairs, especially those within the euro area.\u00a0Return to text, 450807=13.\u00a0\u00a0Although reserves can be held in equity, data from the SEFER (which include both reserve holdings as well as holdings of international organizations) indicate that such holdings are small, and that excluding reserve holdings is a fairly small omission when considering a country's total equity portfolio.

These deficits were largely financed by foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities: during this period, securities inflows from foreign official and private sources were about $5.3 trillion (Figure 1), bringing estimated total foreign holdings of U.S. long-term securities to nearly $10 trillion by year-end 2007. Between 2001 and 2007, combined U.S. equity and bond market capitalization increased by roughly $21 trillion. In other words, the increase in foreign holdings of U.S. long-term securities represented roughly 25 percent of the increase in U.S. market capitalization., 416296=Figure 4.\u00a0\u00a0Shares of Global Bond and Equity Markets Capitalization, 2001 and 2006, 86517=Gugler, K., D.

Economic Journal, 113:F511-F539., 35063=Figure 6 shows the same presentation for changes in portfolio weights in foreign and U.S. bonds. Bond portfolio weights - and their changes between 2001 and 2006 - show a generally similar picture to that for equities, with all countries displaying \"home bias\", a number of countries lying below the 45-degree line, and no countries with appreciably higher U.S. weights than foreign weights in general., 341806=N = 1666, 20226=Although the CPIS data suggest that foreign holdings of U.S. securities are not \"outsized\" relative to total holdings of foreign securities, we also need to consider holdings of \"home country\" securities to properly put U.S. and other foreign holdings into perspective and to assess how much \"room\" foreign investors have to expand their U.S. portfolios. Large holdings (in dollar terms) of foreign securities may not be large relative to holdings of domestic securities, while investors in countries with relatively modest foreign portfolios may in fact be quite internationally diversified. Following the same methodology as in Bertaut and Kole (2003), we construct estimates of domestic holdings of domestic securities, using national financial balance sheet data where available and using proxies based on estimates of market capitalization and international investment position data where balance sheet data are not available. Although this exercise allows for more complete portfolio measures, it limits the sample of \"useable\" CPIS countries to 26, but those countries account for nearly 85 percent of foreign equities reported in the total CPIS for 2006, and more than 80 percent of non-reserve holdings of bonds.12, 460932=33.\u00a0\u00a0The decline in the market cap share for the U.S. to .31 is slightly larger than the .32 generated in BKT because updated estimates for 2007 show slightly more deterioration.\u00a0Return to text, 436026=Data for Figure 7 - Change in Relative Portfolio Weight in U.S. and Foreign Bonds, Including Reserves, 2001-2006, 377016=loglikelihood = -1829.908, 342754=Table 11d.\u00a0\u00a0Probit Regressions: Increase in Equity Portfolio Weight in Given Destination Country - Excludes Pairs with 0 Weight in Both 2001 and 2006, 88147=LaPorta, R., Lopez-de-Silanes, F., Shliefer, A., and Vishny, R.

Journal of International Business Studies 15:55-73., 228954=Log likelihood = -2253.920 N = 1694, 69710=A concern with this specification is that these results may in lare part reflect investor-destination pairs with weights of 0 in 2001 and again in 2006: in 2001, investor countries tended not to invest in securities of countries that were distant or with whom trade was relatively unimportant, and that had a relatively low credit rating. As most of these factors did not change appreciably between 2001 and 2006, these investor countries were still unlikely to invest in these destinations in 2006. Indeed, examination of the predicted probabilities suggests that much of the model's power may be coming from its ability to identify these \"0, 0\" portfolios and not from its ability to identify positive increases in portfolio weights., 380507=N = 1644, 66868=Table 10 shows the actual and relative increases for each investor country in our sample in U.S. equity and U.S. bonds. For the countries in our sample on average, the portfolio weight in both U.S. equities and bonds increased between 2001 and 2006, but by a little less than the relative increase in all foreign securities (the average relative change was negative for both stocks and bonds). For bonds, there is a clear geographic pattern, with European investors tending to increase the weight in U.S. debt securities by less than they increased weights in other securities, whereas Canadian and Asian investors tended to increase the U.S. weight by a little more. For equities, there is no such clear pattern., 453025=18.\u00a0\u00a0The sample for bonds is a bit smaller (26 investor countries) because it is difficult to obtain reliable estimates of domestic investment in domestic bonds. For robustness, regressions were also calculated for 2003.\u00a0Return to text, 2068=Since 2001, foreign investors have acquired roughly $5 trillion in U.S. securities - more than doubling their holdings of U.S. equities and bonds - as both official and private inflows have financed record U.S. current account deficits. Although the rapid growth of foreign holdings of U.S. securities raises concerns that foreign investors may have become too heavily weighted in U.S. assets, foreign investors have not in fact materially changed the relative allocations between U.S. and other foreign securities in their portfolios in recent years. Based on data from the most recent comprehensive surveys of foreign portfolio investment, the 2006 IMF Coordinated Portfolio Investment Surveys (CPIS), most foreign investors remain relatively more underweight in both U.S. equities and bonds than they do in foreign securities in general. Although the underweight position suggests that there remains potential for foreign investors to continue to acquire U.S. securities, econometric evidence indicates that the underweight position itself reflects a preference by foreign investors for securities of countries with which they have strong economic or cultural ties, consistent with recent research that suggests \"location\" or \"information\" preferences in both domestic and international portfolios. As securities markets abroad continue to deepen, such factors are likely to continue to attract investment from \"nearby\" markets, especially from European investors., 189472=Log likelihood = -1677.457 N = 1686, 83575=Ahearne, A., W.

Nearly all industrial country reserves are allocated, and of these, the dollar share in 2005 was 73.6 percent. For developing countries, only about 53 percent of reserves were allocated by currency, with a dollar share of about 60 percent. We assume that for all industrial countries, the dollar share in each period is the same as the allocated industrial dollar share, and likewise for developing countries, the dollar share is the same as the allocated developing country dollar share.\u00a0Return to text, 416479=Data for Figure 4 - Shares of Global Bond and Equity Markets Capitalization, 2001 and 2006, 15930=Because not all countries participate in the SEFER, Table 2 summarizes more complete information on reserve holdings from the IMF Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) surveys, and provides estimates of the portion of those reserves held in dollars. According to these data, total reserves holdings have grown from about $2 trillion at year-end 2001 to about $5 trillion at year-end 2006 and $6.4\u00a0trillion at year-end 2007. Based on COFER information on how much of these reserves are dollar-denominated, we estimate that total dollar reserves likely increased from about $1.5 trillion at year-end 2001to about $4 trillion by 2007, although the dollar share of total reserves is estimated to have declined from about 71 percent to about 63 percent, primarily because of dollar depreciation: over the 6-year period, the dollar depreciated about 33 percent relative to the currencies in the Federal Reserve's Nominal Major Foreign Currency Index.7 The table also shows a similar increase (though starting from a somewhat lower level) for estimated total foreign official holdings of U.S. dollar-denominated portfolio assets from the U.S. liabilities surveys and TIC data.8 We also include information on China's total reserves as reported to the IMF, and, because China is not a CPIS reporter, compare these with our TIC-based estimates of total Chinese holdings of U.S. dollar-denominated assets. We estimate that China's dollar holdings (which include holdings by private Chinese investors as well as official holdings) at year-end 2007 were a little over $1 trillion, of which about $500 billion were in Treasury securities and about $400 billion were in long-term agency securities. It is probably reasonable to assume from these estimates that the bulk of China's total foreign portfolio is in the form of official holdings of U.S. debt securities, and that the share of China's portfolio in dollars has increased from roughly 60 percent in 2001 to about 75 percent by year-end 2006.9, 12037=To address these questions, it is useful to understand how large foreign private holdings of U.S. securities are, how large they are relative to foreign official holdings, and how such holdings have grown over time. We begin by looking at comprehensive estimates of U.S. long-term debt securities and equities held by foreign investors (Figure 2). As of the most recent survey of foreign holdings of U.S. securities conducted for June 2007, foreigners held $9.1 trillion in U.S. long-term securities, with $6 trillion held in long-term debt securities and $3.1 trillion in equities. Total foreign holdings are estimated to have reached about $9.5\u00a0trillion by year-end 2007.3 Figure 2 also documents the sizable (and growing) share of U.S. securities held by foreign official investors, which include both reserve holdings and holdings of central government investment funds. U.S. securities held by foreign official institutions were measured at $2.8 trillion in June 2007 and are estimated to have grown to more than $3.5 trillion by year-end 2007. The larger share of foreign holdings in the form of debt securities compared to equities in part reflects the sizable holdings of official investors. However, foreign private investors also hold a somewhat larger share of their U.S. portfolio in long-term debt securities (about 55 percent) than in equities (roughly 45 percent).4, 361895=loglikelihood = -1677.457, 334848=Table 11b.\u00a0\u00a0Probit Regressions: Increase in Equity Portfolio Weight in Given Destination Country - Excludes Pairs With 0 Weight in Both 2001 and 2006, 447806=10.\u00a0\u00a0For Bermuda, U.S. long-term debt securities were 83 percent of all foreign bonds held in 2001 and 77 percent in 2006.

Based on developments between 2001 and 2006, any further reduction in home bias is likely to be achieved through increases in both U.S. and foreign securities. And compared to the ICAPM, foreign investors could increase their holdings of U.S. securities at least to be equally weighted with all foreign securities even if the current extent of home bias persists. But this assumption leaves unanswered the question of what accounts for the relative underweight in U.S. securities, at least in foreign private portfolios. If this underweight is likely to persist, the potential room to increase holdings of U.S. securities will be more limited., 87385=Karolyi, G.A. and R. Stulz, 2002. Are financial assets priced locally or globally? National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper no. 8994., 34045=For most countries, the movement between the 2001 and 2006 surveys is upward and to the right, indicating portfolios that are becoming somewhat less home-biased. In most cases, the movement is also roughly parallel to the 45-degree line, indicating a roughly equal expansion in U.S. exposure and in foreign exposure in general. However, for a few countries - notably the Czech Republic and Canada, this measure of \"home bias\" increased. This somewhat surprising development is the result of a considerable expansion in home equity for these countries: for the Czech Republic, domestic equity market cap grew 5-fold over this 6-year period, and for Canada, market cap grew 250 percent, whereas global market cap about doubled. As most of this domestic equity was held by domestic investors in both countries, the portfolio shares in foreign equity--and U.S. equity--declined, although in both countries the actual dollar amounts of both their U.S. and their total foreign equity holdings increased., 337970=N = 1105, 243601=loglikelihood = -1733.331 N = 1686, 14683=Table 1a shows total holdings of all foreign long-term debt securities and holdings of U.S. long-term debt securities from the 2001 and 2006 CPIS surveys for the countries with the largest foreign debt portfolios.

(Eds), Recent Developments in Corporate Finance, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge., 228826=Log likelihood = -2113.121 N = 1618, 40717=The regressions are estimated with two types of models: first, the equations for equities and bonds are estimated separately, allowing for individual investor-county country fixed effects in explaining portfolio weights. Second, the equations are estimated with a bivariate model, allowing for the portfolio choices of each investor country across destination country equities and bonds to be determined jointly. For roughly half of the investor-destination country pairs the observed portfolio weight is zero, so both models use tobit specifications. Because of probable errors in determining total market cap for some destination countries as well as possible misclassification of destination countries by some CPIS reporters, we censor the weights from above at a portfolio weight of 6 to trim the extreme outliers in the data and allow us to better identify explainable variation in most portfolio weights.20Censoring with a weight of 6 will still allow us to identify destination countries with considerable overweights, as the average (uncensored) portfolio weights are under 1 for both equities and bonds: the average equity portfolio weight in 2006 was 0.67 and the average bond portfolio weight was 0.79.21 (Appendix Table A1 compares results for the standard equity and bond models with those from uncensored models with and without Luxembourg as a destination (for equities) and with and without several Eastern European countries (for bonds))., 52610=Models 2 and 3 substitute measures of credit risk as measured by CRATE06, the 2006 Euromoney credit risk rating,24 and the Doing Business subcategory rating for investor protection (IPROTECT06) for the composite variable of the strength of the regulatory environment. Both of these variables also enter significantly in both the equity and bond regressions with little effect on the size or significance of the other explanatory variables, suggesting that all three of these variables in general capture overall \"attractiveness\" of a country's securities, and that such factors are clearly important for foreign investors.25, 354527=Projections of U.S. current account and associated financing needs are taken from the baseline projections in Bertaut, Kamin, and Thomas (2008): How Long can the unsustainable U.S. current account deficit be sustained? In all scenarios, total foreign holdings of U.S. securities are assumed to reach $34.3 trillion by 2020. Foreign and U.S. market capitalization are assumed to grow at their projected rates of growth of nominal GDP. U.S. share of global market cap declines to .309 percent in 2020., 38312=This study follows the methodology of Bertaut-Kole to estimate the determinants of relative portfolio weights in both equities and bonds for private investors of 26 investor countries and for an expanded list of destination countries (nearly 80) for 2006.18 Investor countries are primarily developed economies but include some emerging markets as well, whereas about two-thirds of the destination countries are emerging market economies.19 As in Bertaut-Kole, the estimation model is based on the Cooper-Kaplanis (1985) model of international portfolio allocation, with the implication that investors will hold foreign securities closer to their market capitalization weights where (relative) costs of investing are smaller. Such costs will depend on frictions such as restrictions to foreign investment, transaction costs or custodial fees, the legal environment, and the costs of acquiring information. Only private portfolios are considered, as motivations of official investors are likely to differ., 428553=Figure 6.\u00a0\u00a0Change in Relative Portfolio Weights in U.S. and Foreign Bonds (Private Portfolios), 2001-2006, 81261=The experience of the past several years indicates that while projected financing needs of expected U.S. current account deficits are large, there remains considerable room in foreign portfolios for increased holdings of U.S. assets, taking into account the continued need for reserve holdings and the potential for further diversification of official holdings. Despite the roughly 33 percent depreciation of the dollar over the 2001-2007 period, foreign private investors nonetheless increased the dollar amounts of their holdings of U.S. equities and bonds by nearly $3.5 trillion, and official investors acquitted a further $1.8 trillion. Thus far, increased foreign holdings of U.S. securities have been matched by substantial increases in holdings of other foreign securities, in large part reflecting the rapid growth in market capitalization abroad, so that while on average the foreign relative portfolio weight in U.S. securities increased over the period, in most cases it increased by less than did the weight in all foreign securities. However, the persistence of the relative underweight of U.S. securities in foreign portfolios itself suggests that foreign investors are indeed finding attractive alternatives to U.S. securities for portfolio diversification, and the growing availability of such alternatives may have implications for the prices at which foreign investors choose to acquire U.S. securities., 361951=N = 1686, 89032=Portes, R., and H.

National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper no. 7336., 75803=We assume that, as in the \"baseline\" scenario presented in Bertaut, Kamin, and Thomas, U.S. and foreign market capitalization grow at the respective rates of nominal GDP used in the baseline projections.32 In the first scenario, we refine this assumption by assuming different rates of growth of market capitalization of industrial and emerging market economies, reflecting their respective rates of nominal GDP growth. As a result, the share of emerging market capitalization in global market capitalization increases from 17 percent in 2006 to 21 percent by 2020, while the share for industrial countries grows from 46 percent to 48 percent and the share for the U.S. shrinks from 37 percent to 31 percent.33 We further assume that total private portfolios in foreign industrial and emerging market countries grow proportionally with their growth in market capitalization, and that foreign industrial and emerging market investors continue to hold 7.5 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of their total portfolios in U.S. securities, the shares held on average in 2006-2007.

National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper no. 8449., 10542=If current account deficits continue the neighborhood of $600-$650 billion for the next 4-5 years,2 financing those deficits over the next several years will require further net financial inflows of more than $3\u00a0trillion. Based on the experience of the past several years, the bulk of these inflows most likely will continue to be in the form of foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities. However, as Figure 1 also illustrates, U.S. investors' acquisitions of foreign securities have generated an increasing offset to this source of financial inflows: financial outflows from U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities have grown from less than $100 billion per year in 2001 and 2002 to more than $360 billion in 2006 and more than $275 billion in 2007. Financing current account deficits through 2012 could require foreign holdings of U.S. securities to increase by considerably more than $3 trillion, with foreign holdings of U.S. securities by 2011-2012 increasing to levels in the neighborhood of $13-$14 trillion. Looking further out, Bertaut, Kamin, and Thomas (2008) use projections from a detailed partial-equilibrium model of the U.S. external sector and find that U.S. portfolio liabilities in held in the form of U.S. securities could reach $34 trillion by 2020. Would such large increases in holdings of U.S. securities make foreign portfolios unreasonably exposed or \"overweight\" in U.S. assets?, 420596=Data for Figure 5 - Change in Relative Portfolio Weights in U.S. and Foreign Equity, 2001-2006, 85434=Dahlquist, M. and G.

Journal of Financial Economics, 59:413-440., 3869=For the past several years, foreign investors have acquired record amounts of U.S. securities, as both official and private inflows have financed the record U.S. current account deficits. According to official Balance of Payments estimates, foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities totaled about $3 trillion over the five-year period from 2001 to 2005, and in 2006 and 2007, foreign investors acquired $2 trillion more. Have such large increases in foreign holdings of U.S. securities increased foreign portfolio shares to the extent that foreign investors are close to having acquired their \"fill\" of U.S. securities?, 77164=Column A of Table 12 shows the results of this baseline scenario. Industrial country investors would acquire an additional $5.8 trillion in U.S. securities, bringing their total holdings of U.S. securities to $10.4 trillion, and emerging market investors would acquire $3.6 trillion, bringing their total holdings of U.S. securities to $5.3 trillion. Industrial country investors' relative portfolio weight in U.S. securities would increase by a fairly small amount, from 0.20 on average in 2006 to 0.24 by 2020. The effect on emerging market investors is a bit more noticeable (the weight increases from 0.39 to 0.49) but this too does not appear worrisome. Because we assume that foreign official investors would absorb any residual financing required, their holdings of U.S. securities would have to increase by $16.4 trillion to $18.6 trillion. Though this is a large increase, it does not appear unrealistic, given projections of growth in reserve holdings and expectations of increasing portfolios of sovereign wealth funds.34 Further, the rate of growth in official holdings of U.S. securities from 2007 to 2020 is roughly the same as occurred between 1995 and 2007, and while the projected share of U.S. liabilities held by official investors would increase from 26 percent in 2006 to 54 percent by 2020, at 54 percent, the share would be no larger than that held by official investors in the first half of the 1980s., 87869=Lane, P. R. and G. M. Milesi-Ferretti, 2002. International Financial Integration., 454313=21.\u00a0\u00a0Fewer than 2 percent of equity and bond weights in the sample have uncensored values greater than 6. For equities, the most frequent destination country by far to be censored is Luxembourg: 19 of the 28 countries in the sample had reported holdings of Luxembourg equity sufficient to generate equity portfolio weights greater than 6. Some CPIS countries (i.e. Italy and Switzerland) reporting holdings of Luxembourg equity sufficient to generate overweights in excess of 100. Because Luxembourg is a major custodial center, it is probable that some of these overweights reflect holdings of equity held in Luxembourg but not necessarily issued in Luxembourg (see Warnock 2007). However, the pervasiveness of the Luxembourg overweight suggests that fund shares that are not included in the estimate of Luxembourg's market capitalization may also be a contributing factor. For example, two countries known to conduct security-by-security CPIS surveys and thus presumably able to correctly assign equity holdings to actual country of issuance (Austria and Netherlands) have estimated weights in Luxembourg equity of 43.7 and 27, respectively. And although the United States does not appear overweight in Luxembourg equity (calculated relative portfolio weight is .47), nearly one-fourth of Luxembourg equity held by U.S. investors is the form of fund shares (see Report on Foreign Portfolio Holdings of U.S. Securities as of June 30, 2007 http://www.treas.gov/tic/shl2007r.pdf). Reference survey report).For bonds, the most frequent overweights are calculated for a number of emerging-market European countries. For these destination countries, incomplete measures of market cap are likely to be a source of large overweights, as holdings attributed to these destinations are unlikely to reflect custodial holdings.\u00a0Return to text, 398826=Figure 3.\u00a0\u00a0Portfolio Shares in Foreign Long-Term Debt Securities, Foreign Private Holdings From the 2001 and 2006 CPIS Plus Estimated Reserve Holdings, 25712=For some countries, however, reserve holdings can make a marked difference to total holdings of foreign bonds.13 Following the methodology discussed in Bertaut, Griever, and Tryon (2006), we add to each country's foreign bond investment from the CPIS an estimate of total reserve holdings in foreign long-term debt securities, and we add to the reported holdings of U.S. securities an estimate of reserves held in dollars.14 Figure 3 shows the effect of adding reserves to estimated foreign portfolio shares for some of the largest CPIS reporting countries in 2001 and 2006, with the euro area countries again shown in aggregate. For some countries, especially emerging market countries, total foreign shares and shares in U.S. securities are a good bit larger when we include estimates of reserve holdings. The chart also shows a notable increase in the portfolio shares held in other foreign securities, especially euro area securities., 72012=In particular, euro area and other developed European country investors tended to increase their exposures to other securities of other developed European countries by more than they did for foreign exposure overall, reflecting the importance of trade and other connections brought about by proximity. This finding may suggest that for euro area investors, such securities may increasingly be thought of as substitutes for domestic securities in their portfolios. But European investors also expanded into emerging markets where credit ratings increased, especially into those that met the criteria for joining the European Union in 2004. These results thus suggest that although there continued to be considerable appetite for U.S. securities between 2001 and 2006 (as actual weights in U.S. securities did increase over this period), it may not be reasonable to assume going forward that the weight allocated to U.S. securities will increase proportionally with an increase in total foreign securities, especially for European investors., 229082=Log likelihood = -2200.531 N = 1668, 345670=N = 1083}",
