The appropriate percent(s), the to and from dates used to compute the elapsed time, the factor used and the amount computed as the result is displayed and then accumulated into a total for all screens. COMPAD computes in the same manner as COMPA and is designed to be used with one tax module. COMPAD computes DEBIT interest before 1-1-1999. 01-01-1999 and Subsequent for \"Non-Corporate\" taxpayers, COMPAD will compute CREDIT and DEBIT interest (since the interest rate for \"Non-Corporate\" taxpayers will be the same for CREDIT & DEBIT)., 10041=COMPAC is used to compute credit interest before 1-1-1999. From 1-1-1999 on COMPAC will compute credit interest for \"Corporate\" taxpayers only. Input and output formats are the same as COMPAD., 17069=COMPA6 is used to compute interest for Military personnel based on IRM 5.1.7.12.2 where the interest can only be charged at a maximum of 6 percent., 121784=COMPAF\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200308061987 05051987\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200308221987\u2003100.00 This input would generate the INVAL START-DT error message because the program is then actually computing to the end of the month, which in this example will always be the 5th of the month. Because the To Date is past the 5th of the month, the program actually will compute to 09051987, thereby charging the taxpayer with the FTP penalty at the 1/1% rate. Since 09051987 is past 08061987, there will be no computation at the 1% rate. The operator should either re-input the screen without the 1% Start Date or consult the IRM 20.1 to be certain that they have computed the correct 1% Start Date.

Each screen display (page) can accommodate up to 21 amounts. CC COMPA computes and displays a line amount for each line of input. The line amounts are accumulated and displayed on line 23 as the page total. CC COMPA also has the capability of accumulating page totals for display on subsequent page(s). It is important that the interest periods input not overlap. COMPA computes debit interest before 1-1-1999. From 01-01-1999 and subsequent, COMPA will compute CREDIT and DEBIT interest (since the interest rate for \"Non-Corporate\" taxpayers will be the same for CREDIT & DEBIT)., 12476=COMPAM is used for multiple independent credit interest calculations on the same input page. It is possible to input eleven computations on one screen, provided that each input line is associated with a separate tax module. COMPAC will have to be used if the computation from one module requires more than one input line. COMPAM, like its debit interest counterpart, COMPAR, will accept overlapping dates. Line amounts will be displayed and a page total accumulated, which may be carried over onto subsequent pages.

Beginning January 1, 1987, a 1% Start Date may be entered (See Item 3 listed below) on the screen. User can enter up to 21 lines of data on the screen. If the computation is to be continued on a second screen format for the same module, the continuation indicator must be present on the subsequent input for a correct computation of FTP penalty. Due to program complexities and limitations FTP computations involving additional assessments, such as TC290, TC298, TC300, and TC308, must be entered on a separate screen from the original Tax liability., 4514=June 19, 2015, 54930=MFT 58 - 64 PRIOR TO 1968 \u2014 Self Explanatory., 142841=Form 1120, Form 990C, Form 990T or Form 1041A (BMF)., 11810=COMPAR is used when several independent debit interest calculations are desired on the same page of input.
