    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students The best advice I can give to a student is to come check out the campus. Willamette has many visiting days, where there will be many prospective students as well as the experience to come at any time of the year and spend the day with a student and experience life here at Willamette. Bang for the buck Although the main drawback for coming to Willamette for me personally was money, I feel that every cent spent here is well worth it. There has not been a single moment at my time here that I have thought that I had made the wrong decision, and that, combined with my education and experiences, makes Willamette truly worthwhile. Am enjoying being here The community at Willamette is simply amazing. I find enjoyable people everywhere I go. Friends can be found in all sorts of places, from our over 100 clubs, classes, or simply hanging out at the Bistro or in a lounge at one of the dorms. Am learning a lot Each day at Willamette I have anywhere from two to five hours of class, at least this semester, and for each class I come out learning something new. Of course",
