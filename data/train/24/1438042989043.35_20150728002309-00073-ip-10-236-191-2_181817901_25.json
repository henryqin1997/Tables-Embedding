Of all the injury and fatality accidents in Washington from 1991 through 1996, nearly 8 percent (9000) occurred during conditions of snow and ice. Just in the past two years (1999 and 2000), 3,675 people have been injured and 64 people have died in accidents during conditions of snow and ice[1]., 24855=Snow and ice control practices are designed to keep roadways passable and as safe as possible during winter weather conditions. Of all the injury and fatality accidents in Washington from 1991 through 1996, nearly 8 percent (9000) occurred during conditions of snow and ice. Just in the past two years (1999 and 2000), 3,675 people have been injured and 64 people have died in accidents during conditions of snow and ice[3]., 29827=Roadside RWIS station implementation in Washington began in the early 1980s. These sensor stations consist of equipment that constantly measures and reports atmospheric and road conditions such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity. WSDOT currently has just over 50 RWIS stations spread throughout the state. (The number of RWIS stations is expected to grow to more than 60 by next year.) In 1998 WSDOT began a program to greatly expand and improve weather data available to both WSDOT maintenance personnel and the traveling public. The program, called rWeather, has resulted in a statewide network of weather stations that includes not only those sensor stations owned by WSDOT but also almost 400 other stations owned by nine other federal, state, and local agencies., 18675=Thermal analysis has not been extensively used for forecasting pavement temperatures in Washington, which instead relies on highly sophisticated modeling techniques. However, a 2000 winter maintenance plan for the North Central Region recommends thermal analysis as a way to increase forecasting capability and thereby reduce winter maintenance costs (Boselly 2000a)., 8236=Note that other states have experienced significantly higher cost savings as a result of anti-icing because they are allowed to use brine, which is far less expensive than the anti-icing chemicals that can be used in Washington. It is also important to note that, despite improved conditions due to anti-icing, the North Central Region has received some negative public reaction to the practice. In February 2001, nearly 900 residents of the Methow Valley submitted a petition to the Secretary of Transportation\u2019s Office calling for an immediate end to use of liquid deicer for anti-icing operations.[8] The chemical used for anti-icing is mixed with an anti-corrosive agent that makes it brown, sticky, and hard to wash off. This is an advantage in keeping the anti-icer on road surfaces but it can be a great irritation to car owners. The anti-icing liquid is known to damage aluminum, a problem for wheels, other car components, trailers, and boats. In the North Central Region last winter, twelve people filed claims for damage. All were rejected. To date, WSDOT has maintained the position that the safety benefits of anti-icing far outweigh the inconveniences to drivers.[9], 28589=RWIS research and testing began in the United States as part of the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP). During the winter of 1990/1991, seven states participated in a test of RWIS that was documented in \"Road Weather Information Systems Volume 1: Research Report\" (Boselly 1993). The study concluded that \u201ctailored and detailed forecasts based on a combination of RWIS sensor and thermal analysis can result in a return on investment of close to five hundred percent, and can significantly improve service levels and greatly decrease the frequency of decision errors,\u201d with the following caveats:, 36771=Use of the rWeather website is growing. Overall use of the website increased 86 percent from 2000 to 2001(March through December), nearly doubling the number of rWeather users. The winter months experience the highest levels of use, as well as the most extremes of usage on a day-to-day basis, as shown on the figure below. (For example, February 2001 included a snowy Friday before a holiday weekend.), 50374=In 1998 WSDOT began a program to greatly expand and improve weather data available to both WSDOT maintenance personnel and the traveling public. The program, called rWeather, has resulted in a statewide network of weather stations that includes not only those sensor stations owned by WSDOT but also almost 400 other stations owned by nine other federal, state, and local agencies., 5841=A statewide survey conducted in 2000 measured customer satisfaction with WSDOT maintenance activities. Activities ranked as very important but for which customers expressed limited satisfaction included maintenance of roadway surfaces, pavement markings, drainage, and snow and ice removal (Pacific Rim Resources 2001). These results point to the need to allocate maintenance resources as effectively and as efficiently as possible., 38955=Visitors to the rWeather website were invited to respond to a short on-line survey from March 6, 2001, to April 9, 2001. During that time 140 members of the public filled out the survey. The objectives of this survey were to better understand who used the site, what kinds of trips they were planning with information they derived from the site, the features of the site they used and how useful they found these features to be for their trip planning, and suggestions they might have for enhancing the overall value of the site., 60129=Washington State Transportation Center (TRAC) University of Washington, Box 354802 University District Building 1107 NE 45th Street, Suite 535 Seattle, Washington\u00a0 98105-4631, 59403=March 2002, 59898=Research Report Research Project T1803, Task 39 Road Weather Info, 44350=WSDOT maintenance personnel were surveyed during May and June of 2001 about their use of, and attitudes toward, various sources of road weather information. Questionnaires were mailed to all 24 maintenance area superintendents with instructions to complete the questionnaire themselves and distribute copies of it to supervisors and lead technicians within their area.

Regardless, accident numbers are highly variable and with only one year of extensive use, it is too early to see any definitive evidence that anti-icing has reduced accidents. A further impediment to the analysis is that data on vehicle miles traveled during ice and snow conditions are not available, making it impossible to calculate accident rates. For the North Central Region and the South Central Region, figures 3-5 and 3-6 show the number of injury accidents and fatal accidents that occurred in conditions of snow and ice [15] .

    "textBeforeTable": "Case Studies The RWIS sensor station network is especially important because it generates data for the road surface temperature modeling done by the University of Washington Department of Atmospheric Sciences. Keeping the existing RWIS stations functioning properly and extending the network to additional locations will further improve the forecasted road surface temperatures that are critical to enabling proactive winter maintenance practices. Under the auspices of the rWeather project, WSDOT has become a participant in the Northwest Regional Weather Consortium, sharing RWIS data with weather observations collected by nine other local, state, and federal agencies (Brown 2000). The combined data are used to improve reporting of actual weather conditions and, perhaps more importantly, to improve the output of weather models and the ability of public and private forecasting services to provide more detailed and targeted weather forecasts. Theoretically at least, the more observational data, the better the weather models and the better the forecasts.\u00a0 Share Weather Observation Data The Wisconsin DOT reports that its pavement marking section and seal coat operations group use RWIS on a daily basis to determine work schedules (RoadSavers 1997). In Washington RWIS has not been reported to be used for this purpose. Although prediction of summer road temperatures in Washington is unlikely to be troublesome, the opportunity presented by RWIS may be the ability to start paving and pavement marking operations earlier in the spring and continue them later into autumn. Although directed primarily at winter maintenance operations, RWIS also can provide",

As mentioned in the previous section, these benefits are improved employee satisfaction and increased productivity as a result of eliminating most regular night shift assignments, as well as the ability to provide a higher level of service for the same cost. Many other states have reported similar benefits that have been documented as RoadSavers case studies. As a follow-up to the SHRP program, FHWA\u2019s RoadSavers program contracted with the University of Nevada-Reno to coordinate and manage an assessment of the economic benefits of SHRP products, including RWIS and anti-icing. The first step involved collecting data on how state and local highway agencies were using SHRP products; this produced more than 100 case studies. Those case studies related to the use of RWIS and anti-icing are summarized in Table 3-2[10]. Case studies indicated particularly substantial cost savings can result from the implementation of both RWIS technology and an anti-icing strategy (Epps 1997).",
