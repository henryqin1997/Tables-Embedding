Shop, Compare & Save with TCGplayer.com! - [ Store FAQ] Gagaga Cowboy is a generic Rank 4, and it's even a Warrior-type, so you can play it with some notable Heroic Champion cards like Heroic Champion - Double Lance. It's really easy to bring out, and its effect lets it trade blows with anything packing 3000 ATK or less - it destroys basically anything you're likely to come up against this format. It's got a cool burn effect that can end games, too, and will probably become the source of some much-maligned loop play somewhere down the line despite its \"once per turn\" restriction. And since it's a Gagaga, it works with Gagaga support! Love it. High Mid Low",
