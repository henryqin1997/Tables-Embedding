Through the SmartWay program, EPA has worked closely with truck manufacturers and truck fleets to develop test procedures to evaluate vehicle and component performance in reducing fuel consumption and has conducted testing and has established test programs to verify technologies that can achieve these reductions. Over the last six years, EPA has developed hands-on experience testing the largest heavy-duty trucks and evaluating improvements in tire and vehicle aerodynamic performance. In 2010, according to vehicle manufacturers, approximately five percent of new combination heavy-duty trucks will meet the SmartWay performance criteria demonstrating that they represent the pinnacle of current heavy-duty truck reductions in fuel consumption., 851664=EPA also requested comments on an alternative approach of allowing manufacturers to use CO 2 credits, on a CO 2 equivalent basis, to offset N 2 O and CH 4 emissions above the applicable standard. This is similar to the approach proposed and being finalized for heavy-duty vehicles as discussed above in Section II.E. EPA requested comments on allowing the additional flexibility in the light-duty program for MYs 2012-2014 to help manufacturers address any near-term issues that they may have with the N 2 O and CH 4 standards., 612784=Based on this analysis, EPA is finalizing the proposed CO 2 attribute-based target standards shown in Figure 0-2 and II-3, and NHTSA is finalizing the equivalent attribute-based fuel consumption target standards, also shown in Figure 0-2 and II-3, applicable in model year 2018. These figures also shows phase-in standards for model years before 2018, and their derivation is explained below, along with alternative implementation schedules to ensure equivalency between the EPA and NHTSA programs while meeting respective statutory obligations. Also, for reasons discussed below, the agencies proposed and are establishing separate targets for gasoline-fueled (and any other Otto-cycle) vehicles and diesel-fueled (and any other Diesel-cycle) vehicles. The targets will be used to determine the production-weighted fleet average standards that apply to the combined diesel and gasoline fleet of HD pickups and vans produced by a manufacturer in each model year., 722169=Commenters who discussed the HD diesel engine standards generally did not differentiate between the standards for engines used in combination tractors and the engines used in vocational vehicles. As explained above in Section II.B.2.b, some commenters, such as EMA/TMA, Cummins, DTNA, and other manufacturers, supported the proposed standards, as long as the flexibilities proposed in the NPRM were finalized as proposed. Volvo argued that the standards are being phased in too quickly. Environmental groups and NGOs commented that the standards should be more stringent and reflect the potential for greater fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions reductions through the use of additional technologies outlined in the 2010 NAS study., 871566=Consistent with the light-duty rule, EPA is finalizing a requirement that a manufacturer will compare the components of its A/C system with a set of leakage-reduction technologies and actions that is based closely on that being developed through the Improved Mobile Air Conditioning program and SAE International (as SAE Surface Vehicle Standard J2727, \u201cHFC-134a, Mobile Air Conditioning System Refrigerant Emission Chart,\u201d August 2008 version). See generally 75 FR 25426. The SAE J2727 approach was developed from laboratory testing of a variety of A/C related components, and EPA believes that the J2727 leakage scoring system generally represents a reasonable correlation with average real-world leakage in new vehicles. Like the cooperative industry-government program, our final approach will associate each component with a specific leakage rate in grams per year that is identical to the values in J2727 and then sum together the component leakage values to develop the total A/C system leakage. However, in the heavy-duty vehicle program, the total A/C leakage score will then be divided by the value of the total refrigerant system capacity to develop a percent leakage per year. EPA believes that the design-based approach will result in estimates of likely leakage emissions reductions that will be comparable to those that would eventually result from performance-based testing., 1010920=The level of the 2014 and 2017 model year final standards and percent reduction from the baseline for each subcategory are included in Table III-6., 629261=EPA is also providing manufacturers with an optional alternative implementation schedule in model years 2016 through 2018, equivalent to NHTSA's first alternative for standards that do not change over these model years, described below. Under this option the phase-in will be 15-20-67-67-67-100 percent of the model year 2019 stringency in model years 2014-2015-2016-2017-2018-2019, respectively. Table 0-13, above, provides the coefficients \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d for this manufacturer's alternative. As explained below, this alternative will provide roughly equivalent overall CO 2 reductions and fuel consumption improvements as the 15-20-40-60-100 percent phase-in. In addition, as explained below, the stringency of this alternative was established by NHTSA such that a manufacturer with a stable production volume and mix over the model year 2016-2018 period could use Averaging, Banking and Trading to comply with either alternative and have a similar credit balance at the end of model year 2018., 822528=EPA proposed a per engine N 2 O emissions standard of 0.05 g/bhp-hr for heavy-duty engines, but is finalizing a standard of 0.10 g/bhp-hr based on additional data submitted to the agency which better represents the full range of current diesel and gasoline engine performance. The final N 2 O standard becomes effective in 2014 model year for diesel engines, as proposed. However, EPA is finalizing N 2 O standards for gasoline engines that become effective in 2016 model year to align with the first year of the CO 2 gasoline engine standards. Without this alignment, manufacturers would not have any flexibility, such as CO 2 eq credits, in meeting the N 2 0 cap and therefore would not have any recourse to comply if an engine's N 2 O emissions were above the standard. The standard remains the same over the useful life of the engine. The N 2 O emissions would be measured over the composite Heavy-duty FTP cycle because it is believed that this cycle poses the highest risk for N 2 O formation versus the additional heavy-duty compliance cycles. The agencies received comments from industry suggesting that the N 2 O and CH 4 emissions be evaluated over the same test cycle required for CO 2 emissions compliance. In other words, the commenters wanted to have the N 2 O emissions measured over the SET for engines installed in tractors. The agencies are not adopting this approach for the final action because we do not have sufficient data to set the appropriate N 2 O level using the SET. The agencies are not requiring any additional burden by requiring the measurement to be conducted over the Heavy-Duty FTP cycle because it is already required for criteria emissions. Averaging of N 2 O emissions between HD engines will not be allowed. The standard is designed to prevent increases in N 2 O emissions from current levels, i.e., a no-backsliding standard., 281622=The agencies are also finalizing an interim alternative compression ignition (diesel) engine standard for model years 2014-2016, again analogous to the alternative standards for compression ignition engines use in combination tractors. The need for this provision and our considerations in adopting it are the same for the engines used in vocational vehicles as for the engines used in combination tractors. As we proposed, these alternative standards will only be available through model year 2016. In addition, manufacturers that use the interim alternative diesel engine standards for model years 2014-2016 under the EPA program must use equivalent fuel consumption standards under the NHTSA program., 830808=Manufacturers without the capability to measure N 2 O by the 2015 model year would need to acquire and install appropriate measurement equipment in response to this final program. EPA has established four separate N 2 O measurement methods, all of which are commercially available today. EPA expects that most manufacturers would use either photo-acoustic measurement equipment for stand-alone, existing FTIR instrumentation at a cost of $50,000 per unit or upgrade existing emission measurement systems with NDIR analyzers for $25,000 per test cell., 944288=Selective catalytic reduction: This technology is common on 2010 the medium- and heavy-duty diesel engines used in Class 7 and 8 tractors (and the agencies therefore have included it as part of the baseline engine, as noted above). Because SCR is a highly effective NO X aftertreatment approach, it enables engines to be optimized to maximize fuel efficiency, rather than minimize engine-out NO X. 2010 SCR systems are estimated to result in improved engine efficiency of approximately 3 to 5 percent compared to a 2007 in-cylinder EGR-based emissions system and by an even greater percentage compared to 2010 in-cylinder approaches. [220] As more effective low-temperature catalysts are developed, the NO X conversion efficiency of the SCR system will increase. Next-generation SCR systems could then enable additional efficiency improvements; alternatively, these advances could be used to maintain efficiency while down-sizing the aftertreatment. We estimate that continued optimization of the catalyst could offer 1 to 2 percent reduction in fuel use over 2010 model year systems in the 2014 model year. [221] The agencies estimate an additional 1 to 2 percent reduction may be feasible in the 2017 model year through additional refinement., 606223=Similar concerns about using weight-based attributes that include vehicle curb weight were raised in the EPA/NHTSA proposal for light-duty GHG and fuel economy standards: \u201cfootprint-based standards provide an incentive to use advanced lightweight materials and structures that would be discouraged by weight-based standards\u201d, and \u201cthere is less risk of `gaming' (artificial manipulation of the attribute(s) to achieve a more favorable target) by increasing footprint under footprint-based standards than by increasing vehicle mass under weight-based standards\u2014it is relatively easy for a manufacturer to add enough weight to a vehicle to decrease its applicable fuel economy target a significant amount, as compared to increasing vehicle footprint\u201d (74 FR 49685, September 28, 2009). The agencies believe that using payload and towing capacities as the work-based attributes avoids the above-mentioned disincentive for the use of lightweighting technology by taking vehicle curb weight out of the standards determination., 540699=The agencies continue to believe that the 400 pound weight target is appropriate to use as a basis for setting the final combination tractor CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption standards. The agencies agree with the commenter that 400 pounds of weight reduction without the use of single wide tires may not be achievable for all tractor configurations. As noted, the agencies have extended the list of weight reduction components in order to provide the manufacturers with additional means to comply with the combination tractors and to further encourage reductions in vehicle weight. The agencies considered increasing the target value beyond 400 pounds given the additional reduction potential identified in the expanded technology list; however, lacking information on the capacity for the industry to change to these lightweight components across the board by the 2014 model year, we have decided to maintain the 400 pound target. The agencies intend to continue to study the potential for additional weight reductions in our future work considering a second phase of vehicle fuel efficiency and GHG regulations. In the context of the current rulemaking for HD fuel consumption and GHG standards, one would expect that reducing the weight of medium-duty trucks similarly would, if anything, have a positive impact on safety. However, given the large difference in weight between light-duty and medium-duty vehicles, and even larger difference between light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles with loads, the agencies believe that the impact of weight reductions of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles would not have a noticeable impact on safety for any of these classes of vehicles. [85], 882521=EPA adopted changes to fuel economy labeling requirements on July 6, 2011 (76 FR 39478). We are making the following corrections to these regulations in 40 CFR part 600:, 713549=EPA's existing criteria pollutant emissions regulations for heavy-duty highway engines establish four service classes (three for compression-ignition or diesel engines and one for spark ignition or gasoline engines) that represent the engine's intended and primary vehicle application, as shown in Table II-16 (40 CFR 1036.140 and NHTSA's 49 CFR 535.4). The agencies proposed to use the existing service classes to define the engine subcategories in this HD GHG emissions and fuel consumption program. The agencies did not receive any adverse comments to using this approach. Thus, the agencies are adopting the four engine subcategories for this final action., 841956=CH 4 is measured under the current 2007 regulations so that it may be subtracted to calculate NMHC. Therefore EPA expects that the final standard would not result in additional testing costs., 417973=As adopted in 40 CFR 1037.230(a)(1)(xiii), manufacturers will be required to group vocational tractors into a unique family, separate from other combination tractors and vocational vehicles. The provision being adopted in 40 CFR 1037.630 and 49 CFR 535.8 requires the manufacturers to summarize in their applications their basis for believing that the vehicles are eligible for manufacturer reclassification as vocational tractors. EPA and NHTSA could ask for a more detailed description of the basis and EPA would deny an application for certification where it determines the manufacturer lacks an adequate basis for reclassification. The manufacturer would then have to resubmit a modified application to certify the vehicles in question to the tractor standards. Where we determine that a manufacturer is not applying this allowance in good faith, we may require that manufacturer to obtain preliminary approval before using this allowance. This would mean that a manufacturer would need to submit its detailed records to EPA and receive formal approval before submitting its application for certification. The agencies plan to monitor how manufacturers classify their tractor fleets and would reconsider the issue of vocational tractor classification in a future rulemaking if necessary., 913388=EPA and NHTSA collected information on the cost and effectiveness of fuel consumption and CO 2 emission reducing technologies from several sources. The primary sources of information were the 2010 National Academy of Sciences report of Technologies and Approaches to Reducing the Fuel Consumption of Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, [197] TIAX's assessment of technologies to support the NAS panel report, [198] EPA's Heavy-duty Lumped Parameter Model, [199] the analysis conducted by the Northeast States Center for a Clean Air Future, International Council on Clean Transportation, Southwest Research Institute and TIAX for reducing fuel consumption of heavy-duty long haul combination tractors (the NESCCAF/ICCT study), [200] and the technology cost analysis conducted by ICF for EPA. [201] Following on the EISA of 2007, the National Research Council appointed a NAS committee to assess technologies for improving fuel efficiency of heavy-duty vehicles to support NHTSA's rulemaking. The 2010 NAS report assessed current and future technologies for reducing fuel consumption, how the technologies could be implemented, and identified the potential cost of such technologies. The NAS panel contracted with TIAX to perform an assessment of technologies which provide potential fuel consumption reductions in heavy-duty trucks and engines and the technologies' associated capital costs. Similar to the Lumped Parameter model which EPA developed to assess the impact and interactions of GHG and fuel consumption reducing technologies for light-duty vehicles, EPA developed a new version of that model to specifically address the effectiveness and interactions of the final pickup truck and light heavy-duty engine technologies. The NESCAFF/ICCT study assessed technologies available in 2012 through 2017 to reduce CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption of line haul combination tractors and trailers. Lastly, the ICF report focused on the capital, maintenance, and operating costs of technologies currently available to reduce CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption in heavy-duty engines, combination tractors, and vocational vehicles., 982764=At proposal, the agencies stated that at least one LRR tire model is available today that meets the rolling resistance requirements of the Level I and Level II tire packages so the 2014 MY should afford manufacturers sufficient lead time to install these packages. EPA and NHTSA conducted additional evaluation testing on HD tires used for tractors. The agencies also received several comments on the suitability of low rolling resistance tires for various HD truck applications. The summary of the agencies findings and a response to issues raised by commenters is presented in Section II.D(1)(a)., 341870=Reducing the cost of regulation through broader use of market tools is a high priority for the Administration. See Executive Order 13563 and in particular section 1(b)(5) and section 4. Consistent with this principle, we intend to seek public comment through a Notice of Data Availability after credit trading begins in 2013, the first year we expect manufacturers to begin certifying 2014 model year vehicles, on whether broader credit trading is more appropriate in developing the next phase of heavy-duty regulations. We believe that input will be better informed by the work the agencies and the regulated industry will have put into implementing this first phase of heavy-duty regulations., 370502=Another commenter, CBD, expressed concern that lack of an expiration date meant that the standards would remain indefinitely, thus forgoing the possibility of increased stringency in the future. CBD argued that this violated NHTSA's statutory duty to set maximum feasible standards. NHTSA disagrees that the indefinite duration of the standards in this rule would prevent the agency from setting future standards at the maximum feasible level in future rulemakings. The absence of an expiration date for these standards should not be interpreted to mean that there will be no future rulemakings to establish new MD/HD fuel efficiency standards for MYs 2019 and beyond\u2014the agencies have already previewed the possibility of such a rulemaking in other parts of this final rule preamble. Therefore, NHTSA believes this concern is unnecessary., 720051=The agencies proposed to require HD diesel engine manufacturers to achieve, on average, a three percent reduction in fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions for the 2014 standards over the baseline MY 2010 performance for the HHD diesel engines, and a five percent reduction for the LHD and MHD diesel engines. The standards for the LHD and MHD engine categories were proposed to be set at the same level because the agencies found that there is an overlap in the displacement of engines which are currently certified as LHDD or MHDD. The agencies developed the baseline 2010 model year CO 2 emissions from data provided to EPA by manufacturers during the non-GHG certification process. Analysis of CO 2 emissions from 2010 model year LHD and MHDD diesel engines showed little difference between LHD and MHD diesel engine baseline CO 2 performance in the 2010 model year, which overall averaged 630 g CO 2/bhp-hr (6.19 gal/100 bhp-hr). [143] Furthermore, the technologies available to reduce fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions from these two categories of engines are similar. The agencies considered combining these engine categories into a single category, but decided to maintain these two separate engine categories with the same standard level to respect the different useful life periods associated with each category., 893354=As described in Section I. F. (2) above, the final standards will remain in effect indefinitely at their 2018 or 2019 levels, unless and until the standards are revised. CBD maintained that this is a per se violation of EISA, arguing that, by definition, standards which are not updated continually and regularly cannot be considered maximum feasible. NHTSA would like to clarify that the NPRM specified that the standards would remain indefinitely \u201cuntil amended by a future rulemaking action.\u201d NPRM at 74172. Further, as noted above, NHTSA has broad discretion to determine the maximum feasible standards. Unlike \u00a7 32902(b)(3)(B), which applies to automobiles regulated under light-duty CAFE, \u00a7 32902(k) does not specify a maximum number of years that fuel economy standards for heavy-duty vehicles will be in place. Consistent with its broad authority to define maximum feasible standards, NHTSA interprets its authority as including the discretion to define expiration periods where Congress has not otherwise specified. This is particularly appropriate for the heavy-duty sector, where fuel efficiency regulation is unprecedented. NHTSA believes that it would be unwise to set an expiration period for this first rulemaking absent both Congressional direction and a known compelling reason for setting a specific date., 911169=Details of the direct and indirect costs, and all applicable ICMs, are presented in Chapter 2 of the RIA. In addition, for details on the ICMs, please refer to the RTI report (See Docket ID EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0162-0283). Importantly, the agencies have revised the ICM factors and the way that indirect costs are calculated using the ICMs. As a result, the ICM factors are now higher, the indirect costs are higher and, therefore, technology costs are higher. The changes made to the ICMs and the indirect cost calculations are discussed in Section VIII of this preamble and are detailed in Chapter 2 of the RIA., 484021=We are finalizing regulatory text (in \u00a7 1036.150) to allow engine manufacturers to used assigned deterioration factors (DFs) without performing their own durability emission tests or engineering analysis. However, the engines would still be required to meet the standards in actual use without regard to whether the manufacturer used the assigned DFs. This allowance is being adopted as an interim provision applicable only for this initial phase of standards., 886664=As demonstrated in the standard-specific discussions later in this section of the preamble, the standards adopted in the final program are consistent with section 202(a) of the CAA and section 32902(k)(2) of EISA. With respect to the EPA rules, we note at the outset, that CBD's premise that EPA must adopt \u201ctechnology-forcing\u201d standards for heavy-duty vehicles and engines is wrong. A technology-forcing standard is one that is to be based on standards which will be available, rather than technology which is presently available. NRDC v. Thomas, 805 F. 2d 410, 429 (DC Cir. 1986). Clean Air Act provisions requiring \u201cthe greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through the application of technology which the Administrator determines will be available\u201d are technology-forcing. See e.g., CAA sections 202(a)(3)(1); [193] 213(a)(3). Section 202(a)(1) standards are technology-based, but not technology-forcing, requiring EPA to issue standards for a vehicle's useful life \u201cafter providing such period as the Administrator finds necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period.\u201d See NACAA v. EPA, 489 F. 3d 1221, 1230 (DC Cir. 2007) upholding EPA's interpretation of similar language in CAA section 231(a) as providing even greater leeway to weigh the statutory factors than if the provision were technology-forcing. See generally 74 FR at 49464-465 (Sept. 28. 2009); 75 FR at 74171., 879841=In a 2008 final rule that set new locomotive and marine engine standards, EPA adopted a provision allowing manufacturers to use a limited number of nonroad engines to power switch locomotives provided, among other things, that \u201cthe engines were certified to standards that are numerically lower than the applicable locomotive standards of this part (1033).\u201d (40 CFR 1033.625(a)). The goal of this provision is to encourage the replacement of aging, high-emitting switch locomotives with new switch locomotives having very low emissions of PM, NO X, and hydrocarbons. However, this provision neglected to consider the fact that preexisting nonroad engine emission standards for CO were set at levels that were slightly numerically higher than those for locomotives. The applicable switch locomotive CO standard of part 1033 is 3.2 g/kW-hr (2.4 g/hp-hr), while the applicable nonroad engine CO standard is 3.5 g/kW-hr (2.6 g/hp-hr). This is the case even for the cleanest final Tier 4 nonroad engines that will phase in starting in 2014. Thus, nonroad engines cannot be certified to CO standards that are numerically lower than the applicable locomotive standards, and the nonroad engine provision is rendered practically unusable. This matter was brought to EPA's attention by affected engine manufacturers. [192], 868216=EPA believes that reducing A/C system leakage is both highly cost-effective and technologically feasible. The availability of low leakage components is being driven by the air conditioning program in the light-duty GHG rule which apply to 2012 model year and later vehicles. The cooperative industry and government Improved Mobile Air Conditioning program has demonstrated that new-vehicle leakage emissions can be reduced by 50 percent by reducing the number and improving the quality of the components, fittings, seals, and hoses of the A/C system. [191] All of these technologies are already in commercial use and exist on some of today's systems, and EPA does not anticipate any significant improvements in sealing technologies for model years beyond 2014. However, EPA has recognized some manufacturers utilize an improved manufacturing process for air conditioning systems, where a helium leak test is performed on 100 percent of all o-ring fittings and connections after final assembly. By leak testing each fitting, the manufacturer or supplier is verifying the o-ring is not damaged during assembly (which is the primary source of leakage from o-ring fittings), and when calculating the yearly leak rate for a system, EPA will allow a relative emission value equivalent to a `seal washer' can be used in place of the value normally used for an o-ring fitting, when 100 percent helium leak testing is performed on those fittings. While further updates to the SAE J2727 standard may be forthcoming (to address new materials and measurement methods for permeation through hoses), EPA believes it is appropriate to include the helium leak test update to the leakage calculation method at this time., 767165=The agencies received comments from the Rubber Manufacturers Association, Michelin, and Bridgestone which identified the need to develop a reference lab and alignment tires. Because the ISO has not yet specified a reference lab and machine for the ISO 28580 test procedure, NHTSA announced in its March 2010 final rule concerning the light-duty tire fuel efficiency consumer information program that NHTSA would specify this laboratory for the purposes of implementing that rule so that tire manufacturers would know the identity of the machine against which they may correlate their test results. NHTSA has not yet announced the reference test machine(s) for the tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. Therefore, for the light-duty tire fuel efficiency rule, the agencies are postponing the specification of a procedure for machine-to-machine alignment until a tire reference lab is established. The agencies anticipate establishing this lab in the future with intentions for the lab to accommodate the light-duty tire fuel efficiency program., 722969=In response to those comments, the agencies refer back to our discussion in Section II.B.2.b. The agencies believe that the additional reductions may be achieved through the increased development of the technologies evaluated for the 2014 model year standard, but the agencies' analysis indicates that this type of advanced engine development will require a longer development time than MY 2014. The agencies are therefore providing additional lead time to allow for the introduction of this additional technology, and waiting until 2017 to increase stringency to levels reflecting application of turbocompounding. See Chapter 2 of the RIA for more details., 454517=However, in recognizing that some manufacturers have engines that would not meet the standard even after applying technologies that improve GHG emissions and fuel consumption by three percent, the agencies are finalizing both the proposed ABT provisions for these engines and also an optional alternate engine standard for 2014 model year, described in more detail below. We believe that concerns expressed by Navistar regarding the 2014 MY standards will be addressed by this alternative standard. The agencies also continue to believe that the 2017 MY standards are achievable using the above approaches and, in the case of SET certified engines, turbocompounding. While Navistar commented that the 2017 MY standard may be challenging because not all manufacturers are presently producing the technologies that may be required to meet the standards, the agencies believe that since manufacturers that may require turbocompounding to meet the standards will not have to do so until 2017 MY, there will be sufficient lead time for all manufacturers to introduce this technology. As noted above, by MY 2017 all MHD and HHD engines installed in combination tractors should have gone through a redesign during which all needed technology can be applied. We note that we are finalizing these standards as proposed based on the assessment that most manufacturers (not just Navistar) will need to make improvements to existing engine systems in order to meet the standards. EPA's HD diesel engine CO 2 emission standards and NHTSA's HD diesel engine fuel consumption standards for engines installed in tractors are presented in Table II-3. As explained above, the first set of standards take effect with MY 2014 (mandatory standards for EPA, voluntary standards for NHTSA), and the second set take effect with MY 2017 (mandatory for both agencies)., 589990=At proposal, we considered including regeneration in the estimate of fuel consumption and GHG emissions and decided not to do so for two reasons. See 75 FR at 74188. First, EPA's existing criteria emission regulations already provide a strong motivation to engine manufacturers to reduce the frequency and duration of infrequent regeneration events. The very stringent 2010 NO X emission standards cannot be met by engine designs that lead to frequent and extend regeneration events. Hence, we believe engine manufacturers are already reducing regeneration emissions to the greatest degree possible. In addition to believing that regenerations are already controlled to the extent technologically possible, we believe that attempting to include regeneration emissions in the standard setting could lead to an inadvertently lax emissions standard. In order to include regeneration and set appropriate standards, EPA and NHTSA would have needed to project the regeneration frequency and duration of future engine designs in the time frame of this program. Such a projection would be inherently difficult to make and quite likely would underestimate the progress engine manufacturers will make in reducing infrequent regenerations. If we underestimated that progress, we would effectively be setting a more lax set of standards than otherwise would be expected. Hence in setting a standard including regeneration emissions we faced the real possibility that we would achieve less effective CO 2 emissions control and fuel consumption reductions than we will achieve by not including regeneration emissions. Therefore, the agencies are finalizing an approach as proposed which does not include the regenerative emissions., 218014=Allison Transmission commented that NHTSA (implicitly, both agencies) had improperly relied on the NAS report and failed to do sufficient independent analysis, which Allison claimed did not meet the statutory obligation to provide an adequate basis for the rule. First, an agency does not improperly delegate its authority or judgment merely by using work performed by outside parties as the factual basis for its decision making. See U .S. Telecom Ass'n v. FCC, 359 F.3d 554, 568 (DC Cir. 2004); United Steelworkers of Am. v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1216-17 (DC Cir. 1980). Here, although EPA and NHTSA carefully considered the NAS report, the agencies' consideration and use of the report was not uncritical and the agencies exercised reasonable independent judgment in developing the proposed and final rules. Consistent with EISA's direction, NAS submitted a report evaluating MD/HD fuel economy standards to NHTSA in March of 2010. Indeed, many commenters argued that the agencies should have adopted more of the NAS report recommendations. The agencies reviewed the findings and recommendations of the NAS report when developing the proposed rules, as was clearly intended by Congress, but also conducted an independent study, as described throughout the record to the proposal and summarized in Section X of the NPRM, 75 FR at 74351-56. In conducting its analysis of the NAS report, the agencies found that several key recommendations, such as the use of fuel efficiency metrics, were the best approach to implementing the new program. However, the agencies rejected other recommendations of the NAS report, for example, by proposing separate regulation of engines and vehicles and the regulation of large manufacturers., 352431=This final action implements a specific provision from Title II, section 202(a). [44] Section 202(a)(1) of the CAA states that \u201cthe Administrator shall by regulation prescribe (and from time to time revise) * * * standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles * * *, which in his judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d With EPA's December 2009 final findings that certain greenhouse gases may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare and that emissions of GHGs from section 202 (a) sources cause or contribute to that endangerment, section 202(a) requires EPA to issue standards applicable to emissions of those pollutants from new motor vehicles., 661454=As the program progresses and the agencies gather more information, we expect to reconsider whether vocational vehicle standards for MYs 2019 and beyond should be based on the use of additional technologies besides low rolling resistance tires., 702108=The agencies explained in the NPRM that certain vocational vehicles have very limited on-road usage, and that although they would be defined as \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d per 40 CFR 85.1703, the fact that they spend the most of their operations off-road might be reason for excluding them from the vocational vehicle standards. Vocational vehicles, such as those used on oil fields and construction sites, [136] experience very little benefit from LRR tires or from any other technologies to reduce GHG emissions and fuel consumption. The agencies proposed to allow a narrow range of these de facto off-road vehicles to be excluded from the proposed vocational vehicle standards if equipped with special off-road tires having lug type treads. The agencies stated in the NPRM that on/off road traction is the only tire performance parameter which trades off with TRR so significantly that tire manufacturers could be unable to develop tires meeting both a TRR standard while maintaining or improving the characteristic allowing them to perform off-road. See generally 75 FR at 74199-200. Therefore, the agencies proposed to exempt these vehicles from the standards while requiring them to use certified engines, which would provide fuel consumption and CO 2 emission reductions in all vocational applications. To ensure that these vehicles were in fact used chiefly off-road, the agencies proposed requirements that would allow exemption of a vehicle provided the vehicle and the tires were speed restricted. As mentioned, the agencies were aware that the majority of off road trucks primarily use off-road tires and are low speed vehicles as well. Based upon this understanding, the agencies specifically proposed that a vehicle must meet the following requirements to qualify for an exemption from vocational vehicle standards:, 627916=EPA is finalizing the proposed provision that the GHG standards be phased in gradually over the 2014-2018 model years, with full implementation effective in the 2018 model year. Therefore, 100 percent of a manufacturer's vehicle fleet will need to meet a fleet-average standard that will become increasingly more stringent each year of the phase-in period. For both gasoline and diesel vehicles, this phase-in will be 15-20-40-60-100 percent of the model year 2018 stringency in model years 2014-2015-2016-2017-2018, respectively. These percentages reflect stringency increases from a baseline performance level for model year 2010, determined by the agencies based on EPA and manufacturer data. Because these vehicles are not currently regulated for GHG emissions, this phase-in takes the form of target line functions for gasoline and diesel vehicles that become increasingly stringent over the phase-in model years. These year-by-year functions have been derived in the same way as the 2018 function, by taking a percent reduction in CO 2 from a common unregulated baseline. For example, in 2014 the reduction for both diesel and gasoline vehicles will be 15 percent of the fully-phased-in reductions. Figures II-2 and II-3, and Table 0-12, reflect this phase-in approach., 632733=NHTSA is finalizing the proposed provision that manufacturers may voluntarily opt into the NHTSA HD pickup and van program in model years 2014 or 2015. If a manufacturer elects to opt in to the program, it must stay in the program for all the optional model years. Manufacturers that opt in become subject to NHTSA standards for all regulatory categories. To opt into the program, a manufacturer must declare its intent to opt in to the program in its Pre-Model Year Report. The agencies have finalized new requirements for manufacturers to provide all early model declarations as a part of the pre-model year reports. See regulatory text for 49 CFR 535.8 for information related to the Pre-Model Year Report. A manufacturer would begin tracking credits and debits beginning in the model year in which they opt into the program. The handling of credits and debits would be the same as for the mandatory program., 977297=The impact of aerodynamics on a truck's efficiency increases with vehicle speed. Therefore, the usage pattern of the truck will determine the benefit of various aerodynamic technologies. Sleeper cabs are often used in line haul applications and drive the majority of their miles on the highway travelling at speeds greater than 55 mph. The industry has focused aerodynamic technology development, including SmartWay tractors, on these types of trucks. Therefore the agencies are adopting the most aggressive aerodynamic technology application to this regulatory subcategory. All of the major manufacturers today offer at least one SmartWay truck model. The 2010 NAS Report on heavy-duty trucks found that manufacturers indicated that aerodynamic improvements which yield 3 to 4 percent fuel consumption reduction or 6 to 8 percent reduction in Cd values, beyond technologies used in today's SmartWay trucks are achievable. [226] The aerodynamic application rate for Class 8 sleeper cab high roof cabs (i.e., the degree of technology application on which the stringency of the final standard is premised) consists of 20 percent of Bin IV, 70 percent Bin III, and 10 percent Bin II reflecting our assessment of the fraction of tractors in this segment that can successfully apply these aerodynamic packages., 897758=The Institute for Policy Integrity (IPI) commented that the agencies should increase the scope and stringency of the final rule to the point at which net benefits would be maximized, citing Executive Orders 12866 and 13563. EOs 12866 and 13563 instruct agencies, to the extent permitted by law, to select, among other things, the regulatory approaches which maximize net benefits. NHTSA agrees with IPI about the applicability of these EOs and has made every effort to incorporate their guidance in drafting this rule., 350515=By assuming the use of credits for compliance, the agencies were able to set the fuel consumption/GHG standards at more stringent levels than would otherwise have been feasible. Greater improvements in fuel efficiency will occur under more stringent standards; manufacturers will simply have greater flexibility to determine where and how to make those improvements than they would have without credit options. Further, this is consistent with EOs 12866 and 13563, which encourage agencies to design regulations that promote innovation and flexibility where possible. [43], 478319=The agencies stress that this is a temporary and limited option being implemented to address diverse manufacturer needs associated with complying with this first phase of the regulations. As codified in 40 CFR 1036.620 and 49 CFR 535.5(d), this optional standard will be available only for the 2014 through 2016 model years, because we believe that manufacturers will have had ample opportunity to make appropriate changes to bring their product performance into line with the rest of the industry after that time. As proposed, the final rules require that manufacturers making use of these provisions for the optional standard would need to exhaust all credits available to this averaging set prior to using this flexibility and would not be able to generate emissions credits from other engines in the same regulatory averaging set as the engines complying using this alternate approach., 561866=DTNA and ATA additionally requested that the agencies ensure that any VSL provisions adopted under the GHG emissions and fuel efficiency rules align with existing NHTSA standards. The agencies agree and note that there are no existing standards for a VSL outside of this current rulemaking activity. However, NHTSA has announced its intent to publish a proposal in 2012 for a VSL. [94] While both agencies have taken steps to avoid potential conflicts between the rulemaking being finalized today for fuel consumption and GHG emissions and the anticipated safety rulemaking, different conclusions may be reached in a safety-based rulemaking on VSLs, particularly in the approach to specifying soft top parameters and VSL expiration., 176680=In a May 21, 2010 memorandum to the Administrators of EPA and NHTSA (and the Secretaries of Transportation and Energy), the President stated that \u201cAmerica has the opportunity to lead the world in the development of a new generation of clean cars and trucks through innovative technologies and manufacturing that will spur economic growth and create high-quality domestic jobs, enhance our energy security, and improve our environment.\u201d1 2 In the May 2010 memorandum, the President specifically requested the Administrators of EPA and NHTSA to \u201cimmediately begin work on a joint rulemaking under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) to establish fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards for commercial medium-and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work trucks beginning with the 2014 model year (MY).\u201d In this final rulemaking, each agency is addressing this Memorandum by adopting rules under its respective authority that together comprise a coordinated and comprehensive HD National Program designed to address the urgent and closely intertwined challenges of reduction of dependence on oil, achievement of energy security, and amelioration of global climate change., 452018=The agencies received comments from EMA, Navistar, Cummins, ACEEE, Center for Biological Diversity, Detroit Diesel Corporation, American Lung Association, and the Union of Concerned Scientists. Comments were divided with respect to the proposed levels of stringency. While Cummins and DDC expressed support for the CO 2 and fuel consumption standards for diesel engines, and EMA and Navistar stated the standards could be met if the flexibilities outlined in the NPRM are finalized as proposed, Navistar also stated that the model year 2017 standard may not be feasible since what the agencies characterized as existing technologies are not in production for all manufacturers. In contrast, environmental groups and NGOs stated that the standards did not reflect the potential reductions outlined in the 2010 NAS study and should be more stringent. CBD argued that the standards were not set at the maximum feasible level by definition, because the agencies had said that they were based on the use of existing technologies. In addition, the Center for Neighborhood Technology encouraged the agencies to implement the rules as soon as possible, beginning in the 2012 model year., 782366=Bendix suggested using the Composite International Truck Local and Commuter Cycle (CILCC) as the general purpose mixed urban/freeway cycles and to use four representative cycles: mixed urban, freeway, city bus, refuse, and utility. Bendix suggested using the Standardized On-Road Test (SORT) cycles for vocational vehicles operating in the urban environment in addition to SORT cycles for 3 different vocations\u2014with separate weightings. They stated that SORT with an average speed of 11.2 mph, lines up most closely with the average of transit bus duty cycles at 9.9 mph as well as the overall U.S. National average of 12.6 mph. As alternative approaches they suggested adopting the Orange County duty cycle for the urban transit bus vocation, or creating an Urban Transit Bus cycle with several possible weighting factors\u2014all with very high percentage transient (90% to 100%), very low 55 mph (0% to 7%), very low 65 mph (0% to 3%), and an average speed of 15 to 17 mph. Bendix supported their assertions about urban bus vehicle speed with data from the 2010 American Public Transportation Association (APTA) `Fact Book' and other sources. In contrast, Bendix stated, the GEM cycle average speed is currently 32.6 mph. Such high speeds at steady state will penalize technologies such as hybridization., 333154=Table I-9 shows the estimated incremental and total technology outlays for all heavy-duty vehicles for each of the model years 2014-2018. The technology outlays shown in Table I-9 are for the industry as a whole and do not account for fuel savings associated with the program., 422903=As proposed, EPA and NHTSA are finalizing different standards for different subcategories of these tractors with the basis for subcategorization being particular tractor attributes. Attribute-based standards in general recognize the variety of functions performed by vehicles and engines, which in turn can affect the kind of technology that is available to control emissions and reduce fuel consumption, or its effectiveness. Attributes that characterize differences in the design of vehicles, as well as differences in how the vehicles will be employed in-use, can be key factors in evaluating technological improvements for reducing CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption. Developing an appropriate attribute-based standard can also avoid interfering with the ability of the market to offer a variety of products to meet consumer demand. There are several examples of where the agencies have utilized an attribute-based standard. In addition to the example of the light-duty 2012-16 MY vehicle rule, in which the standards are based on the attribute of vehicle \u201cfootprint,\u201d the existing heavy-duty highway engine standards for criteria pollutants have for many years been based on a vehicle weight attribute (Light Heavy, Medium Heavy, Heavy Heavy) with different useful life periods, which is a similar approach finalized for the engine GHG and fuel consumption standards discussed below., 889480=With respect to EISA, 49 U.S.C. section 32902(k)(2) directs NHTSA to \u201cdetermine in a rulemaking proceeding how to implement a commercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicle and work truck fuel efficiency improvement program designed to achieve the maximum feasible improvement,\u201d and \u201cadopt and implement appropriate test methods, measurement metrics, fuel economy standards, and compliance and enforcement protocols that are appropriate, cost-effective, and technologically feasible for commercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work trucks\u201d NHTSA recognizes that Congress intended EPCA (and by extension, EISA, which amended it) to be technology-forcing. See Center for Auto Safety v. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 793 F.2d 1322, 1339 (DC Cir. 1986). However, NHTSA believes it is important to distinguish between setting \u201cmaximum feasible\u201d standards, as EPCA/EISA requires, and \u201cmaximum technologically feasible\u201d standards, as CBD would have NHTSA do. The agency must weigh all of the statutory factors in setting fuel efficiency standards, and therefore may not weigh one statutory factor in isolation of others., 161765=EPA and NHTSA have established dockets for this action under Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0162 and NHTSA-2010-0079, respectively.

The Docket Management Facility is open between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays., 75928=The agencies estimate that the combined standards will reduce CO 2 emissions by approximately 270 million metric tons and save 530 million barrels of oil over the life of vehicles sold during the 2014 through 2018 model years, providing over $7 billion in net societal benefits, and $49 billion in net societal benefits when private fuel savings are considered., 266529=The agencies received a number of comments including from the Senate authors and supporters of the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act suggesting that the standards for heavy-duty pickups and vans should be made more stringent for gasoline vehicles and that the phase-in timing of the standards should be accelerated to the 2016 model year (from 2018). We also received comments arguing that the proposed standards were aggressive and could only be met given the phase-in schedules proposed by the agencies. In response to these comments, we reviewed again the technology assessments from the 2010 NAS report, our own joint light-duty 2012-2016 rulemaking, and information provided by the commenters relevant to the stringency of these standards. After reviewing all of the information, we continue to conclude that the proposed standards and associated phase-in schedules represent technically stringent but reasonable standards considering the available lead time and costs to bring the necessary technologies to market and our own assessments of the efficacy of the technologies when applied to heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans. Further detail on the feasibility of the standards and the agencies' choices among alternative standards is found in Section III.C below., 457739=The agencies have also decided to remove NHTSA's proposed Pre-Certification Compliance Report requirement. Instead, manufacturers must submit their decision to opt into NHTSA's voluntary standards for the 2014 through 2016 model years as part of its certification process with EPA. Once a manufacturer opts into the NHTSA program it must stay in the program for all the subsequent optional model years. Manufacturers that opt in become subject to NHTSA standards for all regulatory categories. The declaration statement must be entered prior to or at the same time the manufacturer submits its first application for a certificate of conformity. NHTSA will begin tracking credits and debits beginning in the model year in which a manufacturer opts into its program., 543879=Idling reduction technologies (IRT) are available to allow for driver comfort while reducing fuel consumptions and CO 2 emissions. Auxiliary power units, fuel operated heaters, battery supplied air conditioning, and thermal storage systems are among the technologies available today. The agencies are adopting a provision for use of extended idle reduction technology as an input to the GEM for Class 8 sleeper cabs. As discussed further in Section III, if a manufacturer wishes to receive credit for using IRT to meet the standard, then an automatic main engine shutoff must be programmed and enabled, such that engine shutdown occurs after 5 minutes of idling, to help ensure the reductions are realized in-use. A discussion of the provisions the agencies are adopting for allowing an override of this automatic shutdown can be found in RIA Chapter 2. As with all of the technology inputs discussed in this section, the agencies are not mandating the use of idle reductions or idle shutdown, but rather allowing their use as one part of a suite of technologies feasible for reducing fuel consumption and meeting the final standards and using these technologies as the inputs to the GEM. The default value (5 g CO 2/ton-mile or 0.5 gal/1,000 ton-mile) for the use of automatic engine shutdown (AES) with idle reduction technologies was determined as the difference between a baseline main engine with idle fuel consumption of 0.8 gallons per hour that idles 1,800 hours and travels 125,000 miles per year, and a diesel auxiliary power unit operating in lieu of main engine during those same idling hours. The agencies received various comments from ACEEE and MEMA regarding the assumptions used to derive the idle reduction value. ACEEE argued that the agencies should use a fuel consumption rate of 0.47 gallon/hour for main engine idling based on a paper written by Kahn. MEMA argued that the agencies should use a main engine idling fuel consumption rate of 0.87 gal/hr, which is the midpoint of a DOE calculator reporting fuel consumption rates from 0.64 to 1.15 gal/hr at idling conditions, and between 800 and 1200 rpm with the air conditioning on and off, respectively. The agencies respectfully disagree with the 0.47 gal/hr recommendation because the same paper by Kahn shows that while idling fuel consumption is 0.47 gal/hr on average at 600 rpm, CO 2 emissions increase by 25 percent with A/C on at 600 rpm, and increase by 165 percent between 600 rpm and 1,100 rpm with A/C on. [88] MEMA recommended using 2,500 hours per year for APU operation. They cited the SmartWay Web site which uses 2,400 hours per year (8 hours per day and 300 days per year). Also, they cited an Argonne study which assumed 7 hours per day and 303 days per year, which equals 2,121 hours per year. Lastly, they referred to the FMCSA 2010 driver guidelines which reduce the number of hours driven per day by one to two hours, which would lead to 2,650 to 2,900 hours per year. The agencies reviewed other studies to quantify idling operations, as discussed in greater detail in RIA Section 2.5.4.2, and believe that the entirety of the research does not support a change from the proposed calculation. Therefore, the agencies are finalizing the calculation as proposed. Additional details regarding the comments, calculations, and agency decisions are included in RIA Section 2.5.4.2., 728332=As discussed above in Section II.B.2.b, the agencies place important weight in making our decisions about the cost-effectiveness of the standards and the availability of lead time on the fact that engine manufacturers are expected to redesign and upgrade their products during MYs 2014-2017. The final two-step CO 2 emission and fuel consumption standards recognize the opportunity for technology improvements over the rulemaking time frame, while reflecting the typical diesel truck manufacturers' and diesel engine manufacturers' product plan cycles. Over these four model years there will be an opportunity for manufacturers to evaluate almost every one of their engine models and add technology in a cost-effective way, consistent with existing redesign schedules, to control GHG emissions and reduce fuel consumption. The time-frame and levels for the standards, as well as the ability to average, bank and trade credits and carry a deficit forward for a limited time, are expected to provide manufacturers the time needed to incorporate technology that will achieve the final GHG and fuel consumption reductions, and to do this as part of the normal engine redesign process. This is an important aspect of the final rules, as it will avoid the much higher costs that would occur if manufacturers needed to add or change technology at times other than these scheduled redesigns. [146] This time period will also provide manufacturers the opportunity to plan for compliance using a multi-year time frame, again in accord with their normal business practice. Further details on lead time, redesigns and technical feasibility can be found in Section III., 312768=In the recent rulemaking for light-duty vehicles, EPA and NHTSA have followed the light duty specific statutory provision that treats one gallon of alternative fuel as equivalent to 0.15 gallons of gasoline until MY 2016, when performance on the EPA CO 2 standards is measured based on actual emissions. 75 FR at 25433. Following that MY 2012-2015 approach in this heavy duty program would mean that, for example, a natural gas powered truck would have attributed to it 20 percent less CO 2 emissions than a comparable diesel powered truck, but 85 percent less fuel consumption. Engine manufacturers with a relatively large share of alternative-fuel products would likely have an easier time complying with NHTSA's average fuel economy standard than with EPA's GHG standard. Similarly, engine manufacturers with a relatively small share of alternative-fuel products would have a relatively easier time complying with EPA's CO 2 standard than with NHTSA's fuel economy standard. In that way, the rule would not differ from the light duty vehicle rules., 474078=In comments to the NPRM, Navistar supported the alternative engine standard, but recommended that it be set at 2 percent below the manufacturer's 2011 baseline. They also supported the extension to 2017 MY at 6 percent. Navistar provided CBI in support of its comments. Volvo, DTNA, environmental groups, NGOs, and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation opposed the optional engine standard, arguing that existing flexibilities are sufficient to allow compliance with the standards and that all manufacturers should be held to the same standards., 379194=Several manufacturers commented that the penalty levels should be limited to those mandated in the light-duty program. Volvo and Daimler argued that Congress intended lower penalties for the HD program than were proposed in the NPRM, because they believed that Congress had expressly or implicitly intended for the HD program to be included in the penalty calculation of Section 32912(b). That section prescribes penalty levels for violators under Section 32902 of \u201c$5 multiplied by each tenth (0.1) of a mile a gallon by which the applicable average fuel economy standard under that section exceeds the average fuel economy,\u201d [49] calculated and applied to automobiles. Volvo further argued that NHTSA was relying upon the CAA as the statutory basis for the penalty levels., 947985=EPA and NHTSA project that CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption reductions can be feasibly and cost-effectively achieved in these rules' time frames through the increased application of aerodynamic technologies, LRR tires, weight reduction, extended idle reduction technologies, vehicle speed limiters, and engine improvements. The agencies believe that hybrid powertrains systems for tractors will not be sufficiently developed and the necessary manufacturing capacity put in place to base a standard on any significant volume of hybrid tractors. The agencies are not aware of any full hybrid systems currently developed for long haul tractor applications. To date, hybrid systems for tractors have been primarily focused on idle shutdown technologies and not the broader energy storage and recovery systems necessary to achieve reductions over typical vehicle drive cycles. The final standards reflect the potential for idle shutdown technologies through the GEM model. Further as highlighted by the 2010 NAS report, the agencies do believe that full hybrid powertrains have the potential in the longer term to provide significant improvements in fuel efficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However lacking any existing systems or manufacturing base, we cannot conclude such technology will be available in the 2014-2018 timeframe. Developing a full hybrid system itself would be a three to five project followed by several more years to put in place manufacturing capacity. The agencies are including incentives for the use of hybrid technologies to help encourage their development and to reward manufacturers that can produce hybrids through prototype and low volume production methods. The agencies also are not including drivetrain technologies in the standard setting process, as discussed in Section II.B.3.h.iv., 710911=A manufacturer having an off-road vehicle failing to meet the criteria under the agencies' off-road exemptions will be allowed to submit a petition describing how and why their vehicles should qualify for exclusion. The process of petitioning for an exemption is explained in \u00a7 1037.631 and \u00a7 535.8. For each request, the manufacturer will be required to describe why it believes an exemption is warranted and address the following factors which the agencies will consider in granting its petition:, 450133=The agencies proposed that the MHD and HHD diesel engine CO 2 standards for Class 7 and 8 combination tractors would become effective in MY 2014 for EPA, with more stringent CO 2 standards becoming effective in MY 2017, while NHTSA's fuel consumption standards would become effective in MY 2017, which would be both consistent with the EISA four-year minimum lead-time requirements and harmonized with EPA's timing. The agencies explained that the three-year timing, besides being required by EISA, made sense because EPA's heavy-duty highway engine program for criteria pollutants had begun to provide new emissions standards for the industry in three year increments, which had caused the heavy-duty engine product plans to fall largely into three year cycles reflecting this regulatory environment. To further harmonize with EPA, NHTSA proposed voluntary fuel consumption standards for MHD and HHD diesel engines that are equivalent to EPA CO 2 standards for MYs 2014-2016, allowing manufacturers to opt into the voluntary standards in any of those model years. [64] NHTSA proposed that manufacturers could opt into the program by declaring their intent to opt in to the program at the same time they submit the Pre-Certification Compliance Report, and that a manufacturer opting into the program would begin tracking credits and debits beginning in the model year in which they opt into the program. Both agencies proposed to allow manufacturers to generate and use credits to achieve compliance with the HD diesel engine standards, including averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) and deficit carry-forward. The agencies sought comment on the proposed MHD and HHD engine standards and timing., 895355=Navistar commented generally that the proposed rule was not technologically feasible, stating that the proposed standards assume technologies which are not in production for all manufacturers. This is not the test for technical feasibility. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA needs only to outline a technical path toward compliance with a standard, giving plausible reasons for its belief that technology will either be developed or applied in the requisite period. NRDC v. EPA, 655 F. 2d 318, 333-34 (DC Cir. 1981). EPA has done so here with respect to the alternative engine standards of particular concern to Navistar. [194] Similarly, NHTSA has previously interpreted \u201ctechnological feasibility\u201d to mean \u201cwhether a particular method of improving fuel economy can be available for commercial application in the model year for which a standard is being established.\u201d 74 FR 14196, 14216. NHTSA has further clarified that the consideration of technological feasibility \u201cdoes not mean that the technology must be available or in use when a standard is proposed or issued.\u201dCenter for Auto Safety v. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 793 F.2d 1322, 1325 n12 (DC Cir. 1986), quoting 42 FR 63, 184, 63, 188 (1977)., 74271=EPA and NHTSA, on behalf of the Department of Transportation, are each finalizing rules to establish a comprehensive Heavy-Duty National Program that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption for on-road heavy-duty vehicles, responding to the President's directive on May 21, 2010, to take coordinated steps to produce a new generation of clean vehicles. NHTSA's final fuel consumption standards and EPA's final carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions standards are tailored to each of three regulatory categories of heavy-duty vehicles: Combination Tractors; Heavy-duty Pickup Trucks and Vans; and Vocational Vehicles. The rules include separate standards for the engines that power combination tractors and vocational vehicles. Certain rules are exclusive to the EPA program. These include EPA's final hydrofluorocarbon standards to control leakage from air conditioning systems in combination tractors, and pickup trucks and vans. These also include EPA's final nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4) emissions standards that apply to all heavy-duty engines, pickup trucks and vans., 459323=The agencies gave full consideration to the need for engine manufacturers to redesign and upgrade their engines during the MYs 2014-2017 to meet standards, and fully considered the cost-effectiveness of the standards and the available lead time. The final two-step CO 2 emission and fuel consumption standards recognize the opportunity for technology improvements over the rulemaking time frame, while reflecting the typical engine manufacturers' product plan cycles. Over these four model years there will be an opportunity for manufacturers to evaluate almost every one of their engine models and add technology in a cost-effective way, consistent with existing redesign schedules, to control GHG emissions and reduce fuel consumption. The time-frame and levels for the standards, as well as the ability to average, bank and trade credits and carry a deficit forward for a limited time, are expected to provide manufacturers the time and flexibilities needed to incorporate technology that will achieve the final GHG and fuel consumption standards within the normal engine redesign process. This is an important aspect of the final rules, as it will avoid the much higher costs that would occur if manufacturers needed to add or change technology at times other than these scheduled redesigns. [65] This time period will also provide manufacturers the opportunity to plan for compliance using a multi-year time frame, again in alignment with their normal business practice. Further details on lead time, redesigns and technical feasibility can be found in Section III., 740483=Just as for HD diesel engines used in combination tractors, the agencies stress that this option for HD engines used in vocational vehicles is temporary and limited and is being adopted to address diverse manufacturer needs associated with complying with this first phase of the regulations. This optional, alternative standard will be available only for the 2014 through 2016 model years, because we believe that manufacturers will have had ample opportunity to make appropriate changes to bring their product performance into line with the rest of the industry after that time. This optional standard will not be available unless and until a manufacturer has exhausted all available credits and credit opportunities, and engines under the alternative standard could not generate credits., 53994=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 4, 2015, 721635=For vocational engines certified on the FTP cycle, the agencies proposed to require a five percent reduction for HHD engines and nine percent for LHD and MHD engines. For LHD and MHD engines in 2017 MY, the nine percent reduction is based on the assumption that valvetrain friction reduction can be achieved in LHD and MHD engines in addition to turbo efficiency and accessory (water, oil, and fuel pump) improvements, improved EGR cooler, and other approaches being used for HHD engines., 434504=The agencies are finalizing the following standards for Class 7 and 8 combination tractors in Table 0-1, using the subcategorization approach that was proposed. As explained below in Section III, EPA has determined that there is sufficient lead time to introduce various tractor and engine technologies into the fleet starting in the 2014 model year, and is finalizing standards starting for that model year predicated on performance of those technologies. EPA is finalizing more stringent tractor standards for the 2017 model year which reflect the CO 2 emissions reductions required for 2017 model year engines. (As explained in Section II.B(3)(h)(v) below, engine performance is one of the inputs into the compliance model, and that input will change in 2017 to reflect the 2017 MY engine standards.) The 2017 MY vehicle standards are not premised on tractor manufacturers installing additional vehicle technologies. EPA's final standards apply throughout the useful life period as described in Section V. As proposed, and as discussed further in Section IV below, manufacturers may generate and use credits from Class 7 and 8 combination tractors to show compliance with the standards., 731164=The agencies have the same interest in providing this flexibility for manufacturers of HD diesel engines for use in vocational vehicles as in providing it for manufacturers of HD diesel engines for use in combination tractors, as long as equivalent emissions and fuel savings are maintained. Thus, in order to provide additional flexibility for manufacturers looking to align their technology changes with multiple regulatory requirements, the agencies are finalizing an alternate \u201cOBD phase-in\u201d option for meeting the HD diesel engine standards which delivers equivalent CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption reductions as the primary standards for the engines built in the 2013 through 2017 model years, as shown in Table II-18., 197644=NHTSA has reviewed this issue and believes that the regulatory schedule is consistent with the lead time requirement of Section 32902(k)(3). To clarify, NHTSA will not be imposing a mandatory regulatory program until 2016, and none of the voluntary standards will be \u201cmandates.\u201d As described in later sections, the voluntary standards would only apply to a manufacturer if it makes the voluntary and affirmative choice to opt-in to the program. [16] Mandatory NHTSA standards will first come into effect in 2016, giving industry four full years of lead time with the NHTSA fuel consumption standards., 394874=EPA is finalizing CO 2 standards and NHTSA is finalizing fuel consumption standards for new Class 7 and 8 combination tractors. The standards are for the tractor cab, with a separate standard for the engine that is installed in the tractor. Together these standards would achieve reductions of up to 23 percent compared to the model 2010 baseline level. As discussed below, EPA is finalizing its proposal to adopt the existing useful life definitions for Class 7 and 8 tractors and the heavy-duty engines installed in them. NHTSA and EPA are finalizing revised fuel consumption and GHG emissions standards for tractors, and finalizing as proposed engine standards for heavy-duty engines in Class 7 and 8 tractors. The agencies' analyses, as discussed briefly below and in more detail later in this preamble and in the RIA Chapter 2, show that these standards are feasible and appropriate under each agency's respective statutory authorities., 826433=EPA sought additional data on the level of the proposed N 2 O level of 0.05 g/bhp-hr. See 75 FR 74208. The agency received additional data of 2010 model year engines from the Engine Manufacturers Association. [178] The agencies reanalyzed a new data set, as shown in Table II-22, to derive the final N 2 O standard of 0.10 g/bhp-hr with a defined deterioration factor of 0.02 g/bhp-hr., 209208=Since the 1980s, EPA has acted several times to address tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants and air toxics from heavy-duty vehicles and engines. During the last 18 years, these programs have primarily addressed emissions of particulate matter (PM) and the primary ozone precursors, hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO X). These programs have successfully achieved significant and cost-effective reductions in emissions and associated health and welfare benefits to the nation. They have been structured in ways that account for the varying circumstances of the engine and truck industries. As required by the CAA, the emission standards implemented by these programs include standards that apply at the time that the vehicle or engine is sold as well as standards that apply in actual use. As a result of these programs, new vehicles meeting current emission standards will emit 98 percent less NO X and 99 percent less PM than new trucks 20 years ago. The resulting emission reductions provide significant public health and welfare benefits. The most recent EPA regulations which were fully phased-in in 2010, the monetized health and welfare benefits alone are projected to be greater than $70 billion in 2030\u2014benefits far exceeding compliance costs and not including the unmonetized benefits resulting from reductions in air toxics and ozone precursors (66 FR 5002, January 18, 2001)., 797740=For the proposal, we considered including regeneration in the estimate of fuel consumption and GHG emissions and decided not to do so for two reasons. First, EPA's existing criteria emission regulations already provide a strong motivation to engine manufacturers to reduce the frequency and duration of infrequent regeneration events. The very stringent 2010 NO X emission standards cannot be met by engine designs that lead to frequent and extend regeneration events. Hence, we believe engine manufacturers are already reducing regeneration emissions to the greatest degree possible. In addition to believing that regenerations are already controlled to the extent technologically possible, we believe that attempting to include regeneration emissions in the standard setting could lead to an inadvertently lax emissions standard. In order to include regeneration and set appropriate standards, EPA and NHTSA would have needed to project the regeneration frequency and duration of future engine designs in the time frame of this program. Such a projection would be inherently difficult to make and quite likely would underestimate the progress engine manufacturers will make in reducing infrequent regenerations. If we underestimated that progress, we would effectively be setting a more lax set of standards than otherwise would be expected. Hence in setting a standard including regeneration emissions we faced the real possibility that we would achieve less effective CO 2 emissions control and fuel consumption reductions than we will achieve by not including regeneration emissions. Therefore, the agencies are finalizing an approach as proposed which does not include the regenerative emissions., 630324=Under the above-described alternatives, each manufacturer will need to demonstrate compliance with the applicable fleet average standard using that year's target function over all of its HD pickups and vans starting with its MY 2014 fleet of HD pickups and vans. No comments were received in support of an alternative approach that EPA requested comment on, involving phasing in an annually increasing percentage of each manufacturer's sales volume., 992929=As discussed in Section II.B.2.g above, we have chosen not to base the standards on performance of VSLs because of concerns about how to set a realistic application rate that avoids unintended adverse impacts. Although we expect there will be some use of VSL, currently it is used when the fleet involved decides it is feasible and practicable and increases the overall efficiency of the freight system for that fleet operator. However, at this point the agencies are not in a position to determine in how many additional situations use of a VSL would result in similar benefits to overall efficiency. Therefore, the agencies are not premising the final standards on use of VSL, and instead will rely on the industry to select VSL when circumstances are appropriate for its use. The agencies have not included either the cost or benefit due to VSLs in analysis of the program's costs and benefits. Implementation of this program may provide greater information for using this technology in standard setting in the future. Many stakeholders including the American Trucking Association have advocated for more widespread use of vehicle speed limits to address fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. The Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) argued the agencies should reflect the use of VSLs in setting the standard for tractors rather than assuming no VSL use in determining the appropriate standard. The agencies have chosen not to do so because, as explained, we are not able at this time to quantify to potential loss in utility due to the use of VSLs. Absent this information, we cannot make a determination regarding the reasonableness of setting a standard based on a particular VSL level. In confirmation, a number of commenters most notably the Owner Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA) suggest that VSLs could significantly impact the ability of a vehicle to deliver goods against a fixed schedule and hence would significantly impact its utility. ATA commented that limited flexibility must be built into speed limiters as not to interfere with NHTSA planned rulemaking in response to 2006 ATA petition and its 2008 Sustainability Plan. Similar comments were received from DTNA requesting that the agencies consider any NHTSA safety regulations that may also be regulating VSLs. NHTSA plans to issue a rule in 2012 addressing the safety performance features of VSLs., 436696=As explained more fully in Section III and Chapter 2 of the RIA, EPA and NHTSA are not adopting more stringent tractor standards for 2014-2017 MY. The final tractor standards are based on the maximum application rates of available technologies considering the available lead time, and we explain in Section III and Chapter 2 of the RIA that use of additional technologies, or further application of the technologies already mentioned would be either infeasible in the lead time afforded, or uneconomic., 216629=The NAS report is far reaching in its review of the technologies that are available and which may become available in the future to reduce fuel consumption from medium and heavy-duty vehicles. In presenting the full range of technical opportunities the report includes technologies which may not be available until 2020 or even further into the future. As such, the report provides not only a valuable list of off the shelf technologies from which the agencies have drawn in developing this near-term 2014-2018 program consistent with statutory authorities and with the set of principles set forth by the President, but the report also provides a road map the agencies can use as we look to develop future regulations for this sector. A review of the technologies in the NAS report makes clear that there are not only many technologies readily available today to achieve important reductions in fuel consumption, like the ones we used in developing the 2014-2018 program, but there are also great opportunities for even larger reductions in the future through the development of advanced hybrid drive systems and sophisticated engine technologies such as Rankine waste heat recovery. The agencies will again make extensive use of this report when we move forward to develop the next phase of regulations for medium and heavy-duty vehicles., 441972=Based on our analysis, the 2017 model year standards for combination tractors and engines represent up to a 23 percent reduction in CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption over a 2010 model year baseline tractor (the baseline sleeper cab does not include idle shutdown technology), as detailed in Section III.A.2. In considering the feasibility of vehicles to comply with the standards, EPA also considered the potential for CO 2 emissions to increase during the regulatory useful life of the product. As we discuss separately in the context of deterioration factor (DF) testing, we have concluded that CO 2 emissions are likely to stay the same or actually decrease in-use compared to new certified configurations. In general, engine and vehicle friction decreases as products wear in leading to reduced parasitic losses and lower CO 2 emissions. Similarly, tire rolling resistance falls as tires wear due to the reduction in tread height. In the case of aerodynamic components, we project no change in performance through the regulatory life of the vehicle since there is essentially no change in their physical form as vehicles age. Similarly, weight reduction elements such as aluminum wheels are not projected to increase in mass through time, and hence, we can conclude will not deteriorate with regard to CO 2 performance in-use. Given all of these considerations, EPA is confident in projecting that the standards finalized today will be technical feasible throughout the regulatory useful life of the program., 824844=The proposed N 2 O level was twice the average N 2 O level of primarily pre-2010 model year diesel engines as demonstrated in the ACES Study and in EPA's testing of two additional engines with selective catalytic reduction aftertreatement systems. [177] Manufacturers typically use design targets for NO X emission levels of about 50 percent of the standard, to account for in-use emissions deterioration and normal testing and production variability, and manufacturers are expected to utilize a similar approach for N 2 O emission compliance., 195314=The timelines for the implementation of the final NHTSA and EPA standards are also closely coordinated. EPA's final GHG emission standards will begin in model year 2014. In order to provide for the four full model years of regulatory lead time required by EISA, as discussed in Section 0 below, NHTSA's final fuel consumption standards will be voluntary in model years 2014 and 2015, becoming mandatory in model year 2016, except for diesel engine standards which will be voluntary in model years 2014, 2015 and 2016, becoming mandatory in model year 2017. Both agencies are also allowing for early compliance in model year 2013. A detailed discussion of how the final standards are consistent with each agency's respective statutory requirements and authorities is found later in this preamble., 179763=The final rules adopted today reflect these principles. The final HD National Program also builds on many years of heavy-duty engine and vehicle technology development to achieve what the agencies believe is the greatest degree of fuel consumption and GHG emission reduction appropriate, technologically and economically feasible, and cost-effective for model years 2014-2018. In addition to taking aggressive steps that are reasonably possible now, based on the technological opportunities and pathways that present themselves during these model years, the agencies and industry will also continue learning about emerging opportunities for this complex sector to further reduce fuel consumption and GHG emission through future regulatory steps., 357132=While the statutory language of section 231 is not identical to other provisions in title II of the CAA that direct EPA to establish technology-based standards for various types of engines, EPA interprets its authority under section 231 to be somewhat similar to those provisions that require us to identify a reasonable balance of specified emissions reduction, cost, safety, noise, and other factors. See, e.g., Husqvarna AB v. EPA, 254 F.3d 195 (DC Cir. 2001) (upholding EPA's promulgation of technology-based standards for small non-road engines under section 213(a)(3) of the CAA). However, EPA is not compelled under section 231 to obtain the \u201cgreatest degree of emission reduction achievable\u201d as per sections 213 and 202 of the CAA, and so EPA does not interpret the Act as requiring the agency to give subordinate status to factors such as cost, safety, and noise in determining what standards are reasonable for aircraft engines. Rather, EPA has greater flexibility under section 231 in determining what standard is most reasonable for aircraft engines, and is not required to achieve a \u201ctechnology forcing\u201d result (70 FR 69664 and 69676, November 17, 2005)., 397776=The agencies received comments from multiple stakeholders regarding the definition and classification of \u201ccombination tractors.\u201d The commenters raised three key issues. First, EMA/TMA, Navistar and DTNA requested that both agencies use the same definition for \u201ctractor\u201d or \u201ctruck tractor\u201d in the final rules. EPA proposed a definition for \u201ctractor\u201d in \u00a7 1037.801 (see the proposed rule published November 30, 2010, 75 FR 74402) which stated that \u201ctractor\u201d means a vehicle capable of pulling trailers that is not intended to carry significant cargo other than cargo in the trailer, or any other vehicle intended for the primary purpose of pulling a trailer. For purposes of this definition, the term \u201dcargo\u201d includes permanently attached equipment such as fire-fighting equipment. The following vehicles are tractors: any vehicle sold to an ultimate purchaser with a fifth wheel coupling installed; any vehicle sold to an ultimate purchaser with the rear portion of the frame exposed where the length of the exposed portion is 5.0 meters or less. See \u00a7 1037.620 for special provisions related to vehicles sold to secondary vehicle manufacturers in this condition. The following vehicles are not tractors: Any vehicle sold to an ultimate purchaser with an installed cargo carrying feature (for example, this would include dump trucks and cement trucks); any vehicle lacking a fifth wheel coupling sold to an ultimate purchaser with the rear portion of the frame exposed where the length of the exposed portion is more than 5.0 meters., 198361=EMA, NADA, and Navistar also argued that the proposed standards would violate the stability requirement of 49 U.S.C. 32902(k)(3)(B), which states that they shall have \u201cnot less than 3 full model years of regulatory stability.\u201d EMA stated that since there are HD emission standards taking effect in 2013, the 2014 implementation date for this rule would violate the stability requirements. NADA argued that the MY 2014-2017/2018 phase-in period was inadequate to fulfill the stability requirement., 939007=Improved Combustion Process: Fuel consumption reductions in the range of 1 to 3 percent over the baseline diesel engine are identified in the 2010 NAS report through improved combustion chamber design, higher fuel injection pressure, improved injection shaping and timing, and higher peak cylinder pressures. [215], 663526=As discussed further below, the agencies are setting CO 2 and fuel consumption standards for the chassis based on tire rolling resistance improvements and for the engines based on engine technologies. The fuel consumption and GHG emissions impact of tire rolling resistance is impacted by the mass of the vehicle. However, the impact of mass on rolling resistance is relatively small so the agencies proposed to aggregate several vehicle weight categories under a single category for setting the standards. The agencies proposed to divide the vocational vehicle segment into three broad regulatory subcategories\u2014Light Heavy-Duty (Class 2b through 5), Medium Heavy-Duty (Class 6 and 7), and Heavy Heavy-Duty (Class 8) which is consistent with the nomenclature used in the diesel engine classification. The agencies received comments supporting the division of vocational vehicles into three regulatory categories from DTNA. The agencies also received comments from Bosch, Clean Air Task Force, and National Solid Waste Management Association supporting a finer resolution of vocational vehicle subcategories. Their concerns include that the agencies' vehicle configuration in GEM is not representative of a particular vocational application, such as refuse trucks. Another recommendation was to divide the category by both GVWR and by operational characteristics. Upon further consideration, the agencies are finalizing as proposed three vocational vehicle subcategories because we believe this adequately balances simplicity while still obtaining reductions in this diverse segment. (As noted in section IV.A below, these three subcategories also denominate separate averaging sets for purposes of ABT.) Finer distinctions in regulatory subcategories would not change the technology basis for the standards or the reductions expected from the vocational vehicle category. As the agencies move towards future heavy-duty fuel consumption and GHG regulations for post-2017 model years, we intend to gather GHG and fuel consumption data for specific vocational applications which could be used to establish application-specific standards in the future., 930064=Transmission: As discussed in the 2010 NAS report, automatic and automated manual transmissions may offer the ability to improve vehicle fuel consumption by optimizing gear selection compared to an average driver. However, as also noted in the report and in the supporting TIAX report, the improvement is very dependent on the driver of the truck, such that reductions ranged from 0 to 8 percent. [211] Well-trained drivers would be expected to perform as well or even better than an automatic transmission since the driver can see the road ahead and anticipate a changing stoplight or other road condition that an automatic transmission can not anticipate. However, poorly-trained drivers that shift too frequently or not frequently enough to maintain optimum engine operating conditions could be expected to realize improved in-use fuel consumption by switching from a manual transmission to an automatic or automated manual transmission. Although we believe there may be real benefits in reduced fuel consumption and GHG emissions through the application of dual clutch, automatic or automated manual transmission technology, we are not reflecting this potential improvement in our standard setting or in our compliance model. We have taken this approach because we cannot say with confidence what level of performance improvement to expect., 829855=Engine emissions regulations do not currently require testing for N 2 O. The Mandatory GHG Reporting final rule requires reporting of N 2 O and requires that manufacturers either measure N 2 O or use a compliance statement based on good engineering judgment in lieu of direct N 2 O measurement (74 FR 56260, October 30, 2009). The light-duty GHG final rule allows manufacturers to provide a compliance statement based on good engineering judgment through the 2014 model year, but requires measurement beginning in 2015 model year (75 FR 25324, May 7, 2010). EPA is finalizing a consistent approach for heavy-duty engine manufacturers which allows them to delay direct measurement of N 2 O until the 2015 model year., 260308=For these reasons, EPA believes it is appropriate to adopt GHG standards for HD pickups and vans based on the whole vehicle (including the engine), expressed as grams per mile, consistent with the way these vehicles are regulated by EPA today for criteria pollutants. NHTSA believes it is appropriate to adopt corresponding gallons per 100 mile fuel consumption standards that are likewise based on the whole vehicle. This complete vehicle approach being adopted by both agencies for HD pickups and vans is consistent with the recommendations of the NAS Committee in their 2010 Report. EPA and NHTSA also believe that the structure and many of the detailed provisions of the recently finalized light-duty GHG and fuel economy program, which also involves vehicle-based standards, are appropriate for the HD pickup and van GHG and fuel consumption standards as well, and this is reflected in the standards each agency is finalizing, as detailed in Section II.C. These commonalities include a new vehicle fleet average standard for each manufacturer in each model year and the determination of these fleet average standards based on production volume-weighted targets for each model, with the targets varying based on a defined vehicle attribute. Vehicle testing will be conducted on chassis dynamometers using the drive cycles from the EPA Federal Test Procedure (Light-duty FTP or \u201ccity\u201d test) and Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET or \u201chighway\u201d test). [29], 381517=NHTSA believes that Section 32912 does not apply to the new HD program for several other reasons. First, this section uses a fuel economy metric, miles/gallon, while the HD program is built around a fuel consumption metric, per the requirement to develop a \u201cfuel efficiency improvement program\u201d and the agencies' conclusion, supported by NAS, that a fuel consumption metric is a much more reasonable choice than a fuel economy metric for HD vehicles given their usage as work vehicles. Second, this section specifies a calculation for automobiles, a vehicle class which is confined to the light-duty rule. In addition, the HD program prescribes fuel consumption standards, not average fuel economy standards., 179209=A program that starts in 2014 and is fully phased in by 2018;, 220064=On May 7, 2010, EPA and NHTSA finalized the first-ever National Program for light-duty cars and trucks, which set GHG emissions and fuel economy standards for model years 2012-2016 (See 75 FR 25324). The agencies have used the light-duty National Program as a model for this final HD National Program in many respects. This is most apparent in the case of heavy-duty pickups and vans, which are very similar to the light-duty trucks addressed in the light-duty National Program both technologically as well as in terms of how they are manufactured (i.e., the same company often makes both the vehicle and the engine). For these vehicles, there are close parallels to the light-duty program in how the agencies have developed our respective final standards and compliance structures, although, as discussed below, the technologies applied to light-duty trucks are not invariably applicable to heavy-duty pickups and vans at the same penetration rates in the lead time afforded in this heavy-duty action. Another difference is that each agency adopts standards based on attributes other than vehicle footprint, as discussed below., 316479=The agencies have analyzed in detail the projected costs, fuel savings, and benefits of the final GHG and fuel consumption standards. Table I-5 shows estimated lifetime discounted program costs (including technological outlays), fuel savings, and benefits for all heavy-duty vehicles projected to be sold in model years 2014-2018 over these vehicles' lives. The benefits include impacts such as climate-related economic benefits from reducing emissions of CO 2 (but not other GHGs) and reductions in energy security externalities caused by U.S. petroleum consumption and imports. The analysis also includes economic impacts stemming from additional heavy-duty vehicle use attributable to fuel savings, such as the economic damages caused by accidents, congestion and noise. Note that benefits reflect on estimated values for the social cost of carbon (SCC), as described in Section VIII.G., 449235=The agencies also proposed to require diesel engine manufacturers to achieve, on average, a six percent reduction in fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions for the 2017 MY standards over the baseline MY 2010 performance for MHD and HHD diesel engines required to use the SET-based standard. The agencies stated that additional reductions could likely be achieved through the increased refinement of the technologies projected to be implemented for 2014, plus the addition of turbocompounding, which the agencies' analysis showed would require a longer development time and would not be available in MY 2014. The agencies therefore proposed to provide additional lead time to allow for the introduction of this additional technology, and to wait until 2017 to increase stringency to levels reflecting application of this technology., 184295=For purposes of this preamble, the term \u201cheavy-duty\u201d or \u201cHD\u201d is used to apply to all highway vehicles and engines that are not within the range of light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles (MDPV) covered by the GHG and Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards issued for MY 2012-2016. [5] It also does not include motorcycles. Thus, in this rulemaking, unless specified otherwise, the heavy-duty category incorporates all vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating above 8,500 pounds, and the engines that power them, except for MDPVs. [6], 181592=The regulatory program we are finalizing today is largely unchanged from the proposal the agencies made on November 30, 2010 (See 75 FR 741512). The structure of the program and the stringency of the standards are essentially the same as proposed. We have made a number of changes to the testing requirements and reporting requirements to provide greater regulatory certainty and better align the NHTSA and EPA portions of the program. In response to comments, we have also made some changes to the averaging, banking and trading (ABT) provisions of the program that will make implementation of this final program more flexible for manufacturers. We have added provisions to further encourage the development of advanced technologies and to provide a more straightforward mechanism to certify engines and vehicles using innovative technologies. Finally in response to comments, we have made some technical changes to our emissions compliance model that results in different numeric standards for both combination tractors and vocational vehicles to more accurately characterize emissions while maintaining the same overall stringency and therefore expected costs and benefits of the program., 870038=Consistent with the light-duty 2012-2016 MY vehicle rule, we are estimating costs for leakage control at $18 (2008$) in direct manufacturing costs. Including a low complexity indirect cost multiplier (ICM) of 1.14 results in costs of $21 in the 2014 model year. A/C control technology is considered to be on the flat portion of the learning curve, so costs in the 2017 model year will be $19. These costs are applied to all heavy-duty pickups and vans, and to all combination tractors. EPA views these costs as minimal and the reductions of potent GHGs to be easily feasible and reasonable in the lead times provided by the final rules., 933828=Management: The 2010 NAS report noted many operational opportunities to reduce fuel consumption, such as driver training and route optimization. The agencies have included discussion of several of these strategies in RIA Chapter 2, but are not using these approaches or technologies in the standard setting process. The agencies are looking to other resources, such as EPA's SmartWay Transport Partnership and regulations that could potentially be promulgated by the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, to continue to encourage the development and utilization of these approaches., 648131=Consistent with the President's May 21, 2010, directive to promote advanced technology vehicles and with the agencies' respective statutory authorities, we are adopting flexibility provisions that parallel similar provisions adopted in the light-duty program. These include credits for advance technology vehicles such as electric vehicles, and credits for innovative technologies that are shown by the manufacturer to provide GHG and fuel consumption reductions in real world driving, but not on the test cycle. See Section IV.B., 631633=The second alternative will be equivalent to the EPA target line functions in each model year starting in 2016 and continuing afterwards. Stringency of fuel consumption standards will increase gradually for the 2016 and later model years. Relative to a model year 2010 unregulated baseline for both gasoline and diesel vehicles, stringency will be 40, 60, and 100 percent of the 2018 target line function in model years 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. The stringency of the target line functions in the first alternative for model years 2016-2017-2018-2019 is 67-67-67-100 percent, respectively, of the 2019 stringency in the second alternative. The stringency of the first alternative was established so that a manufacturer with a stable production volume and mix over the model year 2016-2018 period could use Averaging, Banking and Trading to comply with either alternative and have a similar credit balance at the end of model year 2018 under the EPA and NHTSA programs., 803062=The agencies have identified ten chassis entities that appear to fit the SBA size criterion of a small business. [169] The agencies estimate that these small entities comprise less than 0.5 percent of the total heavy-duty vocational vehicle market in the United States based on Polk Registration Data from 2003 through 2007, [170] and therefore that the exemption will have a negligible impact on the GHG emissions and fuel consumption improvements from the final standards., 416249=Although the agencies agree that these vocational tractors are operated differently than line-haul tractors and therefore fit more appropriately into the vocational vehicle category, we need to ensure that only tractors that are truly vocational tractors are classified as such. Upon further consideration of the comments received the agencies have decided to allow manufacturers to exclude certain vocational-type tractors from the combination tractor standards, and instead be subject to the standards for vocational vehicles. A vehicle determined by the manufacturer to be a HHD vocational tractor would fall into the HHD vocational vehicle subcategory and be regulated as a vocational vehicle. Similarly, MHD which the manufacturer chooses to reclassify as vocational tractors will be regulated as a MHD vocational vehicle. Specifically, under the provision being finalized at 40 CFR 1037.630 and NHTSA's regulation at 49 CFR 523.2 of today's rules only the following three types of vocational tractors are eligible for reclassification by the manufacturer:, 842767=As proposed, if a manufacturer is unable to meet the N 2 O or CH 4 cap standards, the EPA program will allow the manufacturer to comply using CO 2 credits. In other words, a manufacturer could offset any N 2 O or CH 4 emissions above the standard by taking steps to further reduce CO 2. A manufacturer choosing this option would convert its measured N 2 O and CH 4 test results that are in excess of the applicable standards into CO 2 eq to determine the amount of CO 2 credits required. For example, a manufacturer would use 25 Mg of positive CO 2 credits to offset 1 Mg of negative CH 4 credits or use 298 Mg of positive CO 2 credits to offset 1 Mg of negative N 2 O credits. [183] By using the Global Warming Potential of N 2 O and CH 4, the approach recognizes the inter-correlation of these compounds in impacting global warming and is environmentally neutral for demonstrating compliance with the individual emissions caps. Because fuel conversion manufacturers certifying under 40 CFR part 85, subpart F do not participate in ABT programs, EPA is finalizing a compliance option for fuel conversion manufacturers to comply with the N 2 O and CH 4 standards that is similar to the credit program just described above. The compliance option will allow conversion manufacturers, on an individual engine family basis, to convert CO 2 overcompliance into CO 2 equivalents of N 2 0 and/or CH 4 that can be subtracted from the CH 4 and N 2 0 measured values to demonstrate compliance with CH 4 and/or N 2 0 standards. Other than in the limited case of N 2 O for model years 2014-16, we have not finalized similar provisions allowing overcompliance with the N 2 O or CH 4 standards to serve as a means to generate CO 2 credits because the CH 4 and N 2 O standards are cap standards representing levels that all but the worst vehicles should already be well below. Allowing credit generation against such cap standard would provide a windfall credit without any true GHG reduction., 362396=In 1975, Congress enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), mandating a regulatory program for motor vehicle fuel economy to meet the various facets of the need to conserve energy. In December 2007, Congress enacted the Energy Independence and Securities Act (EISA), amending EPCA to require, among other things, the creation of a medium- and heavy-duty fuel efficiency program for the first time. This mandate in EISA represents a major step forward in promoting EPCA's goals of energy independence and security, and environmental and national security., 225542=We expect the technical collaboration with Environment Canada to continue as we implement testing and compliance verification procedures for this rulemaking. We may also begin to develop a knowledge base enabling improvement upon this regulatory framework for model years beyond 2018 (for example, improvements to the means of demonstrating compliance). We also expect to continue our collaboration with Environment Canada on compliance issues., 53355=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 745653=In our meetings with all three of the major manufacturers in the HD pickup and van segment, confidential future product plans were shared with the agencies. Reflecting those plans and our estimates for when engine changes will be made in alignment with those product plans, we had concluded for proposal that the 2016 model year reflects the most logical model year start date for the heavy-duty gasoline engine standards. In order to meet the standards we are finalizing for heavy-duty pickups and vans, we project that all manufacturers will have redesigned their gasoline engine offerings by the start of the 2016 model year. Given the small volume of loose gasoline engine sales relative to complete heavy-duty pickup sales, we think it is appropriate to set the timing for the heavy-duty gasoline engine standard in line with our projections for engine redesigns to meet the heavy-duty pickup truck standards. Therefore, NHTSA's final fuel consumption standard and EPA's final CO 2 standard for heavy-duty gasoline engines are first effective in the 2016 model year., 249944=In addition, the agencies are finalizing separate performance standards for the engines manufactured for use in these trucks. EPA's engine-based CO 2 standards and NHTSA's engine-based fuel consumption standards are implemented using EPA's existing test procedures and regulatory structure for criteria pollutant emissions from medium- and heavy-duty engines. As at proposal, the final engine standards vary depending on engine size linked to intended vehicle service class. Consistent with our proposal, the agencies are finalizing an interim alternative compression ignition engine standard for model years 2014-2016. This alternative standard is designed to provide a glide path for legacy diesel engine products that may not be able to comply with the final engine standards for model years 2014-16 given the short (approximately 2-year) lead time of this program. We believe this alternative standard is appropriate for a first-ever program when the overall baseline performance of the industry is quite varied and where the short lead time means that not every product can be brought into compliance by 2014. The alternative standard only applies through and including model year 2016., 694484=Based on the tire rolling resistance inputs noted above, EPA is finalizing the following CO 2 standards for the 2014 model year for the Class 2b through Class 8 vocational vehicle chassis, as shown in Table II-15. Similarly, NHTSA is finalizing the following fuel consumption standards for the 2016 model year, with voluntary standards beginning in the 2014 model year. For the EPA GHG program, the standard applies throughout the useful life of the vehicle. The agencies note that both the baseline performance and standards derived for the final rules slightly differ from the values derived for the NPRM. The first difference is due to the change in the target rolling resistance from 8.1 to 7.7 kg/metric ton based on the agencies' test results. Second, there are minor differences in the fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions due to the small modifications made to the GEM, as noted in RIA Chapter 4. Lastly, the final HHD vocational vehicle standard uses a revised payload assumption of 15,000 pounds instead of the 38,000 pounds used in the NPRM, as described in Section II.D.3.c.iii. As a result, the emission standards shown in Table II-15 for vocational vehicles have changed from the standards published in the NPRM. The changes for light heavy and medium heavy-duty vehicles are modest. The change for heavy heavy-duty vocational vehicles is larger, due to the difference in assumed payload., 862953=For air conditioning systems with a refrigerant capacity greater than 733 grams, EPA is finalizing a leakage standard which is a \u201cpercent refrigerant leakage per year\u201d to assure that high-quality, low-leakage components are used in each air conditioning system design. The agency believes that a single \u201cgram of refrigerant leakage per year\u201d would not fairly address the variety of air conditioning system designs and layouts found in the heavy-duty truck sector. EPA is finalizing a standard of 1.50 percent leakage per year for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans and Class 7 and 8 tractors. The final standard was derived from the vehicles with the largest system refrigerant capacity based on the Minnesota GHG Reporting database. [190] The average percent leakage per year of the 2010 model year vehicles is 2.7 percent. This final level of reduction is roughly comparable to that necessary to generate credits under the light-duty vehicle program. See 75 FR 25426-25427. Since refrigerant leakage past the compressor shaft seal is the dominant source of leakage in belt-driven air conditioning systems, the agency recognizes that a single \u201cpercent refrigerant leakage per year\u201d is not feasible for systems with a refrigerant capacity of 733 grams or lower, as the minimum feasible leakage rate does not continue to drop as the capacity or size of the air conditioning system is reduced. The fixed leakage from the compressor seal and other system devices results in a minimum feasible yearly leakage rate, and further reductions in refrigerant capacity (the `denominator' in the percent refrigerant leakage calculation) will result in a system which cannot meet the 1.50 percent leakage per year standard. EPA does not believe that leakage reducing technologies are available at this time which would allow lower capacity systems to meet the percent per year standard, so we are finalizing a maximum gram per year leakage standard of 11.0 grams per year for air conditioning systems with a refrigerant capacity of 733 grams or lower. EPA defined the standard, as well as the refrigerant capacity threshold, by examining the State of Minnesota GHG Reporting Database for the yearly leakage rate from 2010 and 2011 model year pickup trucks. In the Minnesota data, the average leak rate for the pickup truck category (16 unique model and refrigerant capacity combinations) was 13.3 grams per year, with an average capacity of 654 grams, resulting in an average percent refrigerant leakage per year of 2.0 percent. 4 of the 16 model/capacity combinations in the reporting data achieved a leak rate 11.0 grams per year or lower, and this was chosen as the maximum yearly leak rate, as several manufacturers have demonstrated that this level of yearly leakage is feasible. To avoid a discontinuity between the \u201cpercent leakage\u201d and \u201cleak rate\u201d standards\u2014where one approach would be more or less stringent, depending on the refrigerant capacity\u2014a refrigerant capacity of 733 grams was chosen as a threshold capacity, below which, the leak rate approach can be used. EPA believes this approach of having a leak rate standard for lower capacity systems and a percent leakage per year standard for higher capacity systems will result in reduced refrigerant emissions from all air conditioning systems, while still allowing manufacturers the ability to produce low-leak, lower capacity systems in vehicles which require them., 175954=EPA and NHTSA (\u201cthe agencies\u201d) are announcing a first-ever program to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel consumption in the heavy-duty highway vehicle sector. This broad sector\u2014ranging from large pickups to sleeper-cab tractors\u2014together represent the second largest contributor to oil consumption and GHG emissions from the mobile source sector, after light-duty passenger cars and trucks. These are the second joint rules issued by the agencies, following on the April 1, 2010 standards to sharply reduce GHG emissions and fuel consumption from MY 2012-2016 passenger cars and light trucks (published on May 7, 2010 at 75 FR 25324)., 420077=Under the regulations being promulgated in 40 CFR 1037.630 and 49 CFR 523.2, manufacturers will be required to keep records of how they determined that such vehicles qualify as vocational. These records would be more detailed than the description submitted in the applications. Typically, this would be a combination of records of the design features and/or purchasers of the vehicles. The agencies have analyzed the design features that reflect the special needs of these vocational tractors in the three areas noted above\u2014mixed service, heavy haul, and urban delivery. Mixed service applications, such as construction trucks, typically require higher ground clearance and approach angle to accommodate non-paved roads. In addition, they often require frame rails with greater resisting bending moment (RBM) because of the terrain where they operate. [54] The mixed service applications also sometimes require higher front axle weight ratings to accommodate extra loads and/or power take off systems for additional capability. Heavy haul tractors are typically designed with frame rails with extra strength (greater RBM) and higher front axle weight ratings to accommodate the heavy payloads. Often the heavy haul tractors will also have higher ground clearance and greater approach angle for similar reasons as the mixed service applications. Lastly, heavy haul vehicles require a total gear reduction of 57:1 or greater to provide the torque necessary to start the vehicle moving. Urban delivery tractors, such as beverage haulers, have less defined design features that reflect their operational needs. These vehicles offer options which include high RBM rails and front axle weight ratings, but not all beverage trucks are specified with these options. The primary differentiation of these urban delivery tractors is their operation. For this final rulemaking, the agencies projected the costs and benefits of the program considering this provision. As detailed in RIA Section 5.3.2.2.1, the agencies assumed that approximately 20 percent of short-haul tractors sold in 2014 model year and beyond will be vocational tractors. As such, these vehicles will experience benefits reflective of a FTP-certified engine and tire rolling resistance improvement at the technology costs projected in the rules for vocational vehicles., 932305=Hybrid: Hybrid powertrain development in Class 7 and 8 tractors has been limited to a few manufacturer demonstration vehicles to date. One of the key benefit opportunities for fuel consumption reduction with hybrids is less fuel consumption when a vehicle is idling, but the standard is already premised on use of extended idle reduction so use of hybrid technology would duplicate many of the same emission reductions attributable to extended idle reduction. NAS estimated that hybrid systems would cost approximately $25,000 per tractor in the 2015 through the 2020 time frame and provide a potential fuel consumption reduction of 10 percent, of which 6 percent is idle reduction which can be achieved (less expensively) through the use of other idle reduction technologies. [213] The limited reduction potential outside of idle reduction for Class 8 sleeper cab tractors is due to the mostly highway operation and limited start-stop operation. Due to the high cost and limited benefit during the model years at issue in this action (as well as issues regarding sufficiency of lead time (see Section III.2 (a) below), the agencies are not including hybrids in assessing standard stringency (or as an input to GEM). However as discussed in Section IV, the agencies are providing incentives to encourage the introduction of advanced technologies including hybrid powertrains in appropriate applications., 596455=The agencies have identified two entities that fit the SBA size criterion of a small business. [110] The agencies estimate that these small entities comprise less than 0.5 percent of the total heavy-duty combination tractors in the United States based on Polk Registration Data from 2003 through 2007, [111] and therefore that the exemption will have a negligible impact on the GHG emissions and fuel consumption improvements from the final standards., 164805=This action affects companies that manufacture, sell, or import into the United States new heavy-duty engines and new Class 2b through 8 trucks, including combination tractors, school and transit buses, vocational vehicles such as utility service trucks, as well as3/4-ton and 1-ton pickup trucks and vans. The heavy-duty category incorporates all motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,500 pounds or greater, and the engines that power them, except for medium-duty passenger vehicles already covered by the greenhouse gas emissions standards and corporate average fuel economy standards issued for light-duty model year 2012-2016 vehicles. Regulated categories and entities include the following:, 821658=The light-duty GHG rule requires that manufacturers begin testing for N 2 O by 2015 model year. The manufacturers of complete pickup trucks and vans (Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler) are already impacted by the light-duty GHG rule and will therefore have this equipment and capability in place for the timing of this rulemaking., 480596=Some commenters argued that manufacturers could game the standard by establishing an artificially high 2011 baseline emission level. This could be done, for example, by certifying an engine with high fuel consumption and GHG emissions that is either: (1) Not sold in significant quantities; or (2) later altered to emit fewer GHGs and consume less fuel through service changes. In order to mitigate this possibility, the agencies are requiring that the 2011 model year baseline must be developed by averaging emissions over all engines in an engine family certified and sold for that model year so as to prevent a manufacturer from developing a single high GHG output engine solely for the purpose of establishing a high baseline. As an alternative, if a manufacturer does not certify all engine families in an averaging set to the alternate standards, then the tested configuration of the engine certified to the alternate standard must have the same engine displacement and its rated power within 5 percent of the highest rated power of the baseline tested configuration. In addition, the tested configuration of the engine certified to the alternate standard must be a configuration sold to customers. These three requirements will prevent a manufacturer from producing an engine with an artificially high power rating and therefore produce artificially low grams of CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption per brake horsepower. In addition, the tested configurations must have a BSFC equivalent to or better than all other configurations within the engine family which will prevent a manufacturer from creating a baseline configuration with artificially high CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption., 355482=Although standards under CAA section 202(a)(1) are technology-based, they are not based exclusively on technological capability. EPA has the discretion to consider and weigh various factors along with technological feasibility, such as the cost of compliance (See section 202(a) (2)), lead time necessary for compliance (section 202(a)(2)), safety (See NRDC, 655 F. 2d at 336 n. 31) and other impacts on consumers, and energy impacts associated with use of the technology. See George E. Warren Corp. v. EPA, 159 F.3d 616, 623-624 (DC Cir. 1998) (ordinarily permissible for EPA to consider factors not specifically enumerated in the CAA). See also Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper, Inc., 129 S.Ct. 1498, 1508-09 (2009) (congressional silence did not bar EPA from employing cost-benefit analysis under Clean Water Act absent some other clear indication that such analysis was prohibited; rather, silence indicated discretion to use or not use such an approach as the agency deems appropriate)., 633766=For manufacturers that opt into NHTSA's HD pickup and van fuel consumption program in 2014 or 2015, the stringency would increase gradually each model year. Relative to a model year 2010 unregulated baseline, for both gasoline and diesel vehicles, stringency would be 15-20 percent of the model year 2019 target line function stringency (under the NHTSA first alternative) and 15-20 percent of the model year 2018 target line function stringency (under the NHTSA second alternative) in model years 2014-2015, respectively. The corresponding absolute standards target levels are provided in Figure II-2 and II-3, and the accompanying equations., 671188=The agencies also explained that while LRR tires can be applied to vehicles in all MD/HD classes, they may have special potential for improving fuel efficiency and reducing CO 2 emissions for vocational vehicles. According to an energy audit conducted by Argonne National Lab, tires are the second largest contributor to energy losses of vocational vehicles, after engines. [123] Given this finding, the agencies considered the availability of LRR tires for vocational applications by examining the population of tires available, and concluded that there appeared to be few LRR tires for vocational applications. The agencies suggested in the NPRM that this low number of LRR tires for vocational vehicles could be due in part to the fact that the competitive pressure to improve rolling resistance of vocational vehicle tires has been less than in the line haul tire market, given that line haul vehicles generally drive significantly more miles and therefore have significantly higher operating costs for fuel than vocational vehicles, and much greater incentive to improve fuel consumption. The small number of LRR tires for vocational vehicles may perhaps also be due in part to the fact that vocational vehicles generally operate more frequently on secondary roads, gravel roads and roads that have less frequent winter maintenance, which leads vocational vehicle buyers to value tire traction and durability more than rolling resistance. The agencies recognized that this provided an opportunity to improve fuel consumption and GHG emissions by creating a regulatory program that encourages improvements in tire rolling resistance for both line haul and vocational vehicles. The agencies proposed to base standards for all segments of HD vehicles on the use of LRR tires. The agencies estimated that a 10 percent reduction in average tire rolling resistance would be attainable between model years 2010 and 2014 based on the tire development achievements over the last several years in the line haul truck market. This reduction in tire rolling resistance would correlate to a two percent reduction in fuel consumption as modeled by the GEM. [124], 939463=Turbochargers: Improved efficiency of a turbocharger compressor or turbine could reduce fuel consumption by approximately 1 to 2 percent over variable geometry turbochargers in the market today. [216] The 2010 NAS report identified technologies such as higher pressure ratio radial compressors, axial compressors, and dual stage turbochargers as design paths to improve turbocharger efficiency., 737251=As discussed above in Section II.B.2.b, while the agencies believe that the HD diesel engine standards are appropriate, cost-effective, and technologically feasible in the rulemaking time frame, we also recognize that when regulating a category of engines for the first time, there will be individual products that may deviate significantly from the baseline level of performance, whether because of a specific approach to criteria pollution control, or due to engine calibration for specific applications or duty cycles. That earlier discussion described HD diesel engines for use in combination tractors, but the same supporting information is relevant to the agencies' consideration of an alternate standard for HD diesel engines installed in vocational vehicles. In the NPRM, the agencies proposed an optional engine standard for HD diesel engines installed in vocational vehicles based on a five percent reduction from the engine's own 2011 model year baseline level, but requested comment on whether a two percent reduction would be more appropriate. [147] The comments received in response did not directly address engines for vocational vehicles, but the agencies believe that the information provided by Navistar and others is equally applicable to HD diesel engines for combination tractors and for vocational vehicles. Our assessment for the final standards is that a 2.5 percent reduction is appropriate for LHD and MHD engines installed in vocational vehicles and 3 percent is appropriate for HHD engines installed in vocational vehicles given the technologies available for application to legacy products by model year 2014. [148] Unlike the majority of engine products in this segment, engine manufacturers have devoted few resources to developing technologies for these legacy products reasoning that the investment would have little value if the engines are to be substantially redesigned or replaced in the next five years. Hence, although the technologies we have identified to achieve the proposed five percent reduction would theoretically work for these legacy products, there is inadequate lead time for manufacturers to complete the pre-application development needed to add the technology to these engines by 2014. The mix of technologies available off the shelf for legacy engines varies between engine lines within OEMs and varies among OEMs as well. On average, based on our review of manufacturer development history and current plans, we project that for the legacy products approximately half of the defined technologies appropriate for the 2014 standard will be available and ready for application by 2014 for older legacy engine designs. Hence, we have concluded that if we limit the reductions to those improvements which reflect further enhancements of already installed systems rather than the addition or replacement of technologies with fully developed new on the shelf components, the potential improvement for the 2014 model year will be 2.5 percent for LHD and MHD engines and 3 percent HHD engines., 750527=We are finalizing regulatory text (in \u00a7 1036.150) to allow engine manufacturers to used assigned deterioration factors (DFs) without performing their own durability emission tests or engineering analysis. However, the engines would still be required to meet the standards in actual use without regard to whether the manufacturer used the assigned DFs. This allowance is being adopted as an interim provision applicable only for this initial phase of standards., 695979=As with the 2017 MY standards for Class 7 and 8 tractors, EPA and NHTSA are adopting more stringent vocational vehicle standards for the 2017 model year which reflect the CO 2 emissions reductions required through the 2017 model year engine standards. See also Section II.B.2 explaining the same approach for the standards for combination tractors. As explained in Section 0 below, engine performance is one of the inputs into the GEM compliance model that has a pre-defined (i.e. fixed) value established by the agencies, and that input will change in the 2017 MY to reflect the 2017 MY engine standards. The 2017 MY vocational vehicle standards are not premised on manufacturers installing additional vehicle technologies, and a vocational vehicle that complies with the standards in MY 2016 will also comply in MY 2017 with no vehicle (tire) changes. Thus, although chassis manufacturers will not be required to make further improvements in the 2017 MY to meet the standards, the standards will be more stringent to reflect the engine improvements required in that year. This is because in 2017 MY GEM vehicle modeling outputs (in grams per ton mile and gallons per 1,000 ton mile) will automatically decrease since engine efficiency will improve in that year., 665744=The agencies received comments supporting the exclusion of recreational vehicles, emergency vehicles, school buses from the vocational vehicle standards. The commenters argued that these individual vehicle types were small contributors to overall GHG emissions and that tires meeting their particular performance needs might not be available by 2014. The agencies considered these comments and the agencies have met with a number of tire manufacturers to better understand their expectations for product availability for the 2014 model year. Based on our review of the information shared, we are convinced that tires with rolling resistance consistent with our final vehicle standards and meeting the full range of other performance characteristics desired in the vehicle market, including for RVs, emergency vehicles, and school buses, will be broadly available by the 2014 model year. [122] Absent regulations for the vast majority of vehicles in this segment, feasible cost-effective reductions available at reasonable cost in the 2014-2018 model years will be needlessly foregone. Therefore, the agencies have decided to finalize the vocational vehicle standards as proposed with recreational vehicles, emergency vehicles and school buses included in the vocational vehicle category. As RVs were not included by NHTSA for proposed regulation, they are not within the scope of the NPRM and are therefore excluded in NHTSA's portion of the final program. NHTSA will revisit this issue in the next rulemaking. In developing the final standards, the agencies have evaluated the current levels of emissions and fuel consumption, the kinds of technologies that could be utilized by manufacturers to reduce emissions and fuel consumption and the associated lead time, the associated costs for the industry, fuel savings for the consumer, and the magnitude of the CO 2 and fuel savings that may be achieved. After examining the possibility of vehicle improvements based on use of the technologies underlying the standards for Class 7 and 8 tractors, including improved aerodynamics, vehicle speed limiters, idle reduction technologies, tire rolling resistance, and weight reduction, as well as use of hybrid technologies, the agencies ultimately determined to base the final vehicle standards on performance of tires with superior rolling resistance. For standards for diesel engines installed in vocational vehicles, the agencies examined performance of engine friction reduction, aftertreatment optimization, air handling improvements, combustion optimization, turbocompounding, and waste heat recovery, ultimately deciding to base the final standards on the performance of all of the technologies except turbocompounding and waste heat recovery systems. The standards for gasoline engine installed in vocational vehicles are based on performance of technologies such as gasoline direct injection, friction reduction, and variable valve timing. The agencies' evaluation indicates that these technologies, as described in Section III.C, are available today in the heavy-duty tractor and light-duty vehicle markets, but have very low application rates in the vocational vehicle market. The agencies have analyzed the technical feasibility of achieving the CO 2 and fuel consumption standards, based on projections of what actions manufacturers would be expected to take to reduce emissions and fuel consumption to achieve the standards, and believe that the standards are cost-effective and technologically feasible and appropriate within the rulemaking time frame. EPA and NHTSA also present the estimated costs and benefits of the vocational vehicle standards in Section III., 373488=The statute is silent with respect to how \u201cprotocol\u201d should be interpreted. The term \u201cprotocol\u201d is imprecise and thus Congress' choice of that term affords the agency substantial breadth of discretion. For example, in a case interpreting Section 301(c)(2) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the DC Circuit noted that the word \u201cprotocols\u201d has many definitions that are not much help. Kennecott Utah Copper Corp., Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Interior, 88 F.3d. 1191, 1216 (DC Cir. 1996). Section 301(c)(2) of CERCLA prescribed the creation of two types of procedures for conducting natural resources damages assessments. The regulations were to specify (a) \u201cstandard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation\u201d (the \u201cType A\u201d rules), and (b) \u201calternative protocols for conducting assessments in individual cases\u201d (the \u201cType B\u201d rules). [48] The court upheld the challenged provisions, which were a part of a set of rules establishing a step-by-step procedure to evaluate options based on certain criteria, and to make a decision and document the results., 894733=NHTSA believes that the phase-in schedules provide an appropriate balance between the technology-forcing purpose of the statute and EISA-mandated considerations of economic practicability. NHTSA recognizes, as noted in the case above, that balancing each statutory factor in order to set the maximum feasible standards means that the agency must engage in a \u201creasonable accommodation of conflicting policies.\u201dSee 538 F.3d at 1195, supra. Here, the agency has determined that the phase-in schedules are one such reasonable accommodation., 201194=Each standard, associated phase-in schedule, and alternative standard implemented by this final rule was noticed in the NPRM. Those fuel consumption standards that become mandatory in 2017 will remain in effect through at least 2019. This further ensures that the fuel consumption standards in this rule will remain in effect for at least three years, providing the statutorily-mandated three full years of regulatory stability, and ensuring that manufacturers will not be subject to new or amended standards too rapidly. (The greenhouse gas emission standards remain in effect unless and until amended in all later model years in any case.) Therefore, NHTSA believes the commenters' concern about regulatory stability is addressed in the structure of the rule., 75480=EPA's final greenhouse gas emission standards under the Clean Air Act will begin with model year 2014. NHTSA's final fuel consumption standards under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 will be voluntary in model years 2014 and 2015, becoming mandatory with model year 2016 for most regulatory categories. Commercial trailers are not regulated in this phase of the Heavy-Duty National Program., 306012=The agencies continue to believe that alternative-fueled vehicles, including NGVs, provide fuel consumption benefits that should be, and are, accounted for in this program. However, the agencies do not agree with the commenters' claim that the NGV incentive contained in EISA, and reflected in the light-duty program, is an explicit Congressional directive that must also be applied to the heavy-duty program, nor that the light-duty incentive for NGVs should be interpreted as an implicit Congressional directive for NGVs to be comparably incentivized in the heavy-duty program. Further, the agencies believe that the fuel consumption benefits that alternative fuel vehicles would obtain through measuring CO 2 emissions for the EPA program and converting CO 2 emissions to fuel consumption for the NHTSA program accurately reflects their energy benefits. This accurate accounting, in conjunction with the volumetric increases required by the Renewable Fuels Standard, provides sufficient incentives for these vehicles. The agencies continue to believe that the light-duty conversion factor is not appropriate for this program. Instead, the agencies are finalizing measuring the performance of alternative fueled vehicles by measuring CO 2 emissions for the EPA program and converting CO 2 emissions to fuel consumption for the NHTSA program. The agencies are also finalizing measuring FFV performance with a 50-50 weighting of alternative and conventional fuel test results through MY 2015, and an agency- or manufacturer-determined weighting based on demonstrated fuel use in the real world after MY 2015 (defaulting to an assumption of 100 percent conventional fuel use)., 985777=As also explained in that earlier discussion, the agencies, upon further analysis, continue to believe that a 400 pound weight reduction package is appropriate for tractors in the time frame. As stated in Section II.B.2.e above, for tractors where single wide tires are not appropriate, the manufacturers have additional options available to achieve weight reduction, such as body panels and chassis components as documented in the earlier discussion. The agencies have extended the list of weight reduction components in order to provide the manufacturers with additional means to comply with the combination tractors and to further encourage reductions in vehicle weight. The agencies considered increasing the target value beyond 400 pounds given the additional reduction potential components identified in the expanded list; however, lacking information on the capacity for the industry to change to these light weight components across the board by the 2014 model year, we have decided to maintain the 400 pound target. The agencies intend to continue to study the potential for additional weight reductions in our future work considering a second phase of truck fuel efficiency and GHG regulations., 471547=Although the agencies believe that the standards for the HD diesel engines installed in combination tractors are generally appropriate, cost-effective, and technologically feasible in the rulemaking time frame, we also recognize that when regulating a category of engines for the first time, there will be individual products that may deviate significantly from the baseline level of performance, whether because of a specific approach to criteria pollution control, or due to engine calibration for specific applications or duty cycles. In the current fleet of 2010 and 2011 model year engines used in combination tractors, NHTSA and EPA understand that there is a relatively small group of legacy engines that are up to approximately 25 percent worse than the average baseline for other engines. For this group of legacy MHD and HHD diesel engines installed in tractors, when compared to the typical performance levels of the majority of the engines in the fleet and the fuel consumption/GHG emissions reductions that the majority of engines would achieve through increased application of technology, the same reduction from the industry baseline may not be possible at reasonably comparable cost given the same amount of lead-time, because these products may require a total redesign in order to meet the standards. Manufacturers of the MHD and HHD diesel engines installed in tractors with atypically high baseline CO 2 and fuel consumption levels may also, in some instances, have a limited line of engines across which to average performance to meet the generally-applicable standards., 947147=Bottoming Cycle: An engine with bottoming cycle uses exhaust or other heat energy from the engine to create power without the use of additional fuel. The sources of energy include the exhaust, EGR, charge air, and coolant. The estimates for fuel consumption reduction range up to 10 percent as documented in the 2010 NAS report. [224] However, none of the bottoming cycle or Rankine systems has been demonstrated commercially and are currently in only the research stage. See Section 2.4.2.7 of the RIA and Section II.B above., 360892=EPA established the Light-duty FTP for emissions measurement in the early 1970s. In 1976, in response to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, EPA extended the use of the Light-duty FTP to fuel economy measurement (See 49 U.S.C. 32904(c)). EPA can determine fuel efficiency of a vehicle by measuring the amount of CO 2 and all other carbon compounds (e.g., total hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide (CO)), and then, by mass balance, calculating the amount of fuel consumed., 742364=As discussed above in Section II.B.2.b, Volvo argued that manufacturers could game the standard by establishing an artificially high 2011 baseline emission level. This could be done, for example, by certifying an engine with high fuel consumption and GHG emissions that is either: (1) Not sold in significant quantities; or (2) later altered to emit fewer GHGs and consume less fuel through service changes. In order to mitigate this possibility, the agencies are requiring either that the 2011 model year baseline must be developed by averaging emissions over all engines in an engine averaging set certified and sold for that model year so as to prevent a manufacturer from developing a single high GHG output engine solely for the purpose of establishing a high baseline or meet additional criteria. The agencies are allowing manufacturers to combine light heavy-duty and medium heavy-duty diesel engines into a single averaging set for this provision because the engines have the same GHG emissions and fuel consumption standards. If a manufacturer does not certify all engine families in an averaging set to the alternate standards, then the tested configuration of the engine certified to the alternate standard must have the same engine displacement and its rated power within 5 percent of the highest rated power as the baseline engine. In addition, the tested configurations must have a BSFC equivalent to or better than all other configurations within the engine family and represent a configuration that is sold to customers., 978742=The 90 percent of tractors that we project can either be Bin II or Bin III equipped reflects the bulk of Class 8 high roof sleeper cab applications. We are not projecting a higher fraction of Bin III aerodynamic systems because of the limited lead time for the program and the need for these more advanced technologies to be developed and demonstrated before being applied across a wider fraction of the fleet. Aerodynamic improvements through new tractor designs and the development of new aerodynamic components is an inherently slow and iterative process. Aerodynamic impacts are highly nonlinear and often reflect unexpected interactions between multiple components. Given the nature of aerodynamic improvements it is inherently difficult to estimate the degree to which improvements can be made beyond previously demonstrated levels. The changes required for Bins III and IV reflect the kinds of improvements projected in the Department of Energy's Supertruck program. That program assumes that such systems can be demonstrated on vehicles by 2017. In this case, the agencies are projecting that truck OEMs will be able to begin implementing these aerodynamic technologies prior to 2017 on a limited scale. Importantly, our averaging, banking and trading provisions provide manufacturers with the flexibility to implement these technologies over time even though the standard changes in a single step., 860135=Air conditioning systems contribute to GHG emissions in two ways\u2014direct emissions through refrigerant leakage and indirect exhaust emissions due to the extra load on the vehicle's engine to provide power to the air conditioning system. HFC refrigerants, which are powerful GHG pollutants, can leak from the A/C system. [187] This includes the direct leakage of refrigerant as well as the subsequent leakage associated with maintenance and servicing, and with disposal at the end of the vehicle's life. [188] The most commonly used refrigerant in automotive applications\u2014R134a, has a high GWP of 1430. [189] Due to the high GWP of R134a, a small leakage of the refrigerant has a much greater global warming impact than a similar amount of emissions of CO 2 or other mobile source GHGs., 861710=The quantity of GHG refrigerant emissions from heavy-duty trucks relative to the CO 2 emissions from driving the vehicle and moving freight is very small. Therefore, a credit approach is not appropriate for this segment of vehicles because the value of the credit is too small to provide sufficient incentive to utilize feasible and cost-effective air conditioning leakage improvements. For the same reason, including air conditioning leakage improvements within the main standard would in many instances result in lost control opportunities. Therefore, EPA is finalizing the proposed requirement that vehicle manufacturers meet a low leakage requirement for all air conditioning systems installed in 2014 model year and later trucks, with one exception. The agency is not finalizing leakage standards for Class 2b-8 Vocational Vehicles at this time due to the complexity in the build process and the potential for different entities besides the chassis manufacturer to be involved in the air conditioning system production and installation, with consequent difficulties in developing a regulatory system., 440896=Thestandard values shown above differ somewhat from the proposal, reflecting refinements made to the GEM in response to comments. For example, the agencies received comments from stakeholders concerned that the 2017 MY tractor standards appeared to be backsliding because the reductions were not in line with the reductions expected from the 2017 MY engine standards. The agencies reviewed the issue and found that the engine maps we created in the GEM for the 2017 model year for the proposal did not appropriately reflect the engine improvements. Therefore, the agencies developed new fuel maps for the GEM v2.0 which fully reflect the engine improvements due to the 2017 MY standards. [60] These changes to the GEM did not impact our estimates of the relative effectiveness of the greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption improving technologies modeled in this final action nor the overall cost or benefits estimated for these final vehicle standards., 934587=The baseline engine for the Class 8 tractors is a Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel engine with 15 liters of displacement which produces 455 horsepower. The agencies are using a smaller baseline engine for the Class 7 tractors because of the lower combined weights of this class of vehicles require less power, thus the baseline is an 11L engine with 350 horsepower. The agencies developed the baseline diesel engine as a 2010 model year engine with an aftertreatment system which meets EPA's 0.20 grams of NO X/bhp-hr standard with an SCR system along with EGR and meets the PM emissions standard with a diesel particulate filter with active regeneration. The baseline engine is turbocharged with a variable geometry turbocharger. The following discussion of technologies describes improvements over the 2010 model year baseline engine performance, unless otherwise noted. Further discussion of the baseline engine and its performance can be found in Section III.A.2.6 below., 622217=To calculate a manufacturer's HD pickup and van fleet average standard, the agencies are requiring that separate target curves be used for gasoline and diesel vehicles. The agencies estimate that in 2018 the target curves will achieve 15 and 10 percent reductions in CO 2 and fuel consumption for diesel and gasoline vehicles, respectively, relative to a common baseline for current (model year 2010) HD pickup trucks and vans. An additional two percent reduction in GHGs will be achieved by the direct air conditioning leakage standard in the EPA standards. These reductions are based on the agencies' assessment of the feasibility of incorporating technologies (which differ significantly for gasoline and diesel powertrains) in the 2014-2018 model years, and on the differences in relative efficiency in the current gasoline and diesel vehicles. The resulting reductions represent roughly equivalent stringency levels for gasoline and diesel vehicles, which is important in ensuring our program maintains product choices available to vehicle buyers., 285269=The agencies are setting standards beginning in the 2014 model year and establishing more stringent standards in the 2017 model year. Table I-4 presents EPA's final CO 2 standards and NHTSA's final fuel consumption standards for chassis manufacturers of Class 2b through Class 8 vocational vehicles for the 2017 model year. The 2017 model year standards represent a 6 to 9 percent reduction in CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption over a 2010 model year vehicle., 358441=This interpretation was upheld as reasonable in NACAA v. EPA, 489 F.3d 1221, 1230 (DC Cir. 2007). CAA section 202(a) does not specify the degree of weight to apply to each factor, and EPA accordingly has discretion in choosing an appropriate balance among factors. See Sierra Club v. EPA, 325 F.3d 374, 378 (DC Cir. 2003) (even where a provision is technology-forcing, the provision \u201cdoes not resolve how the Administrator should weigh all [the statutory] factors in the process of finding the `greatest emission reduction achievable' \u201d). See also Husqvarna AB v. EPA, 254 F. 3d 195, 200 (DC Cir. 2001) (great discretion to balance statutory factors in considering level of technology-based standard, and statutory requirement \u201cto [give appropriate] consideration to the cost of applying * * * technology\u201d does not mandate a specific method of cost analysis); see also Hercules Inc. v. EPA, 598 F. 2d 91, 106 (DC Cir. 1978) (\u201cIn reviewing a numerical standard the agencies must ask whether the agency's numbers are within a zone of reasonableness, not whether its numbers are precisely right\u201d); Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 797 (1968) (same); Federal Power Commission v. Conway Corp., 426 U.S. 271, 278 (1976) (same); Exxon Mobil Gas Marketing Co. v. FERC, 297 F. 3d 1071, 1084 (DC Cir. 2002) (same)., 563501=The GEM simulation model uses various inputs to characterize a vehicle's configuration (such as weight, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance) and predicts how the vehicle would behave on the road when it follows a driving cycle (vehicle speed versus time). As noted by the 2010 NAS Report, [95] the choice of a drive cycle used in compliance testing has significant consequences on the technology that will be employed to achieve a standard as well as the ability of the technology to achieve real world reductions in emissions and improvements in fuel consumption. Manufacturers naturally will design vehicles to ensure they satisfy regulatory standards. An ill-suited drive cycle for a regulatory category could encourage GHG emissions and fuel consumption technologies which satisfy the test but do not achieve the same benefits in use. For example, requiring all trucks to use a constant speed highway drive cycle will drive significant aerodynamic improvements. However, in the real world a combination tractor used for local delivery may spend little time on the highway, reducing the benefits achieved by this technology. In addition, the extra weight of the aerodynamic fairings will actually penalize the GHG and fuel consumption performance in urban driving and may reduce the freight carrying capability. The unique nature of the kinds of CO 2 emissions control and fuel consumption technology means that the same technology can be of benefit during some operation but cause a reduced benefit under other operation. [96] To maximize the GHG emissions and fuel consumption benefits and avoid unintended reductions in benefits, the drive cycle should focus on promoting technology that produces benefits during the primary operation modes of the application. Consequently, drive cycles used in GHG emissions and fuel consumption compliance testing should reasonably represent the primary actual use, notwithstanding that every vehicle has a different drive cycle in-use., 746794=The baseline 2010 model year CO 2 performance of these heavy-duty gasoline engines over the Heavy-duty FTP cycle is 660 g CO 2/bhp-hr (7.43 gal/100 bhp-hr) in 2010 based on non-GHG certification data provided to EPA by the manufacturers. The agencies are finalizing 2016 model year standards that require manufacturers to achieve a five percent reduction in CO 2 compared to the 2010 MY baseline through use of technologies such as coupled cam phasing, engine friction reduction, and stoichiometric gasoline direct injection. Additional detail on technology feasibility is included in Section III and in the RIA Chapter 2. As shown in Table II-20, NHTSA is finalizing as proposed a 7.06 gallon/100 bhp-hr standard for fuel consumption while EPA is adopting as proposed a 627 g CO 2/bhp-hr standard tested over the Heavy-duty FTP, effective in the 2016 model year. Similar to EPA's non-GHG standards approach, manufacturers may generate and use credits by the same engine averaging set to show compliance with both agencies' standards., 1002927=The agencies used the technology inputs and final technology application rates in GEM to develop the final fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions standards for each subcategory of Class 7 and 8 combination tractors. The agencies derived a scenario tractor for each subcategory by weighting the individual GEM input parameters included in Table III-3 with the application rates in Table III-4. For example, the Cd value for a Class 8 Sleeper Cab High Roof scenario case was derived as 10 percent times 0.68 plus 70 percent times 0.60 plus 20 percent times 0.55, which is equal to a Cd of 0.60. Similar calculations were done for tire rolling resistance, weight reduction, idle reduction, and vehicle speed limiters. To account for the two final engine standards, the agencies assumed a compliant engine in GEM. [230] In other words, EPA is finalizing the use of a 2014 model year fuel consumption map in GEM to derive the 2014 model year tractor standard and a 2017 model year fuel consumption map to derive the 2017 model year tractor standard. [231] The agencies then ran GEM with a single set of vehicle inputs, as shown in Table III-5, to derive the final standards for each subcategory. Additional detail is provided in the RIA Chapter 2., 741386=The agencies note that manufacturers choosing to utilize this option in MYs 2014-2016 will have to make a greater relative improvement in MY 2017 than the rest of the industry, since they will be starting from a worse level. For compliance purposes, in MYs 2014-2016 emissions from engines certified and sold at the alternate level will be averaged with emissions from engines certified and sold at more stringent levels to arrive at a weighted average emissions level for all engines in the subcategory. Again, this option can only be taken if all other credit opportunities have been exhausted and the manufacturer still cannot meet the primary standards. If a manufacturer chooses this option to meet the EPA emission standards in MY 2014-2016, and wants to opt into the NHTSA fuel consumption program in these same MYs it must follow the exact path followed under the EPA program utilizing equivalent fuel consumption standards., 984989=The agencies proposed setting the 2014 model year tractor standards using 100 percent application of a 400 pound weight reduction package. Volvo and ATA stated in their comments that not all fleets can use single wide tires and if this is the case the 400 pound weight reduction cannot be met. The agencies also received comments from MEMA, Navistar, American Chemistry Council, the Auto Policy Center, Iron and Steel Institute, Arvin Meritor, Aluminum Association, and environmental groups and NGOs identifying other potential weight reduction opportunities for tractors. As described in Section II.B.3.e above, the agencies are adopting an expanded list of weight reduction options which can be input into the GEM for the final rulemaking., 765461=The agencies believe this test procedure provides two advantages over other test methods. First, the ISO 28580 test method is unique in that it specifies a procedure to correlate results between different test equipment (i.e., different tire rolling resistance test machines). This is important because NHTSA's research conducted for the light-duty tire fuel efficiency program indicated that machine-to-machine differences are a source of variation. [156] In addition, the ISO 28580 test procedure is either used, or proposed to be used, by several groups including the European Union through Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 [157] and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) through a staff recommendation for a California regulation, [158] and the EPA SmartWay program. Using the ISO 28580 may help reduce burden on manufacturers by allowing a single test protocol to be used for multiple regulations and programs. While we recognize that commenters recommended the use of other test procedures, like SAE J1269, the agencies have determined there is no established data conversion method from the SAE J1269 vehicle condition for vocational vehicle tires to the ISO 28580 single point condition at this time, and that given our reasonable preference for the ISO procedure, it would not be practical to attempt to include the use of the SAE J1269 procedure as an optional way of determining CRR values for the GEM inputs., 837829=EPA is finalizing the proposed CH 4 emission standard of 0.05 g/mi as measured on the Light-duty FTP and HFET drive cycles, to apply beginning with model year 2014 for HD pickups and vans subject to the CO 2 standards. Similar to the CO 2 standard approach, the CH 4 emission level of a vehicle will be a composite of the Light-duty FTP and HFET cycles, with the same 55 percent city weighting and 45 percent highway weighting., 854336=Manufacturers supported not only adopting the aspects of the heavy-duty approach noted above, but the entire heavy-duty vehicle approach, including two aspects of the program not contemplated in EPA's request for comments. First, manufacturers commented that EPA incorrectly characterizes the light-duty vehicle issues with CH 4 and N 2 O as short-term or early lead time issues. For the reasons discussed above, manufacturers believe the changes should be made permanent, for the entire 2012-2016 light-duty rulemaking period and, indeed, in any subsequent rules for the light-duty vehicle sector. Second, manufacturers commented that N 2 O and CH 4 should be measured on the combined 55/45 weighting of the FTP and highway cycles, respectively, as these cycles are the yardstick for fuel economy and CO 2 measurement. Manufacturers commented that there should not be a disconnect between the light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle programs., 642813=EPA is finalizing the proposed provision that the in-use standards for HD pickups and vans be established by adding an adjustment factor to the full useful life emissions and fuel consumption results used to calculate the fleet average. EPA is also finalizing the proposed provision that the useful life for these vehicles with respect to GHG emissions be set equal to their useful life for criteria pollutants: 11 years or 120,000 miles, whichever occurs first (40 CFR 86.1805-04(a))., 215820=In April 2010 as mandated by Congress in EISA, the National Research Council (NRC) under NAS issued a report to NHTSA and to Congress evaluating medium-duty and heavy-duty truck fuel efficiency improvement opportunities, titled \u201cTechnologies and Approaches to Reducing the Fuel Consumption of Medium- and Heavy-duty Vehicles.\u201d [21] This study covers the same universe of heavy-duty vehicles that is the focus of this final rulemaking\u2014all highway vehicles that are not light-duty, MDPVs, or motorcycles. The agencies have carefully evaluated the research supporting this report and its recommendations and have incorporated them to the extent practicable in the development of this rulemaking., 297167=After finalization of the N 2 O and CH 4 standards for light-duty vehicles as part of the 2012-2016 MY program, some manufacturers raised concerns that they may have difficulty meeting those standards across their light-duty vehicle fleets. In response to these concerns, as part of the same Federal Register notice as the heavy-duty proposal, EPA requested comments on additional options for manufacturers to comply with light-duty vehicle N 2 O and CH 4 standards to provide additional near-term flexibility. Commenters providing comment on this issue supported additional flexibility for manufacturers. EPA is finalizing provisions allowing manufacturers to use CO 2 credits, on a CO 2-equivalent basis, to meet the N 2 O and CH 4 standards, which is consistent with many commenters' preferred approach. Manufacturers will have the option of using CO 2 credits to meet N 2 O and CH 4 standards on a test group basis as needed for MYs 2012-2016., 818884=EPA is finalizing the proposed per-vehicle N 2 O emission standard of 0.05 g/mi, measured over the Light-duty FTP and HFET drive cycles. Similar to the CO 2 standard approach, the N 2 O emission level of a vehicle would be a composite of the Light-duty FTP and HFET cycles with the same 55 percent city weighting and 45 percent highway weighting. The standard would become effective in model year 2014 for all HD pickups and vans that are subject to the CO 2 emission requirements. Averaging between vehicles would not be allowed. The standard is designed to prevent increases in N 2 O emissions from current levels, i.e., a no-backsliding standard., 215015=Congress also stated that NHTSA may set separate standards for different classes of HD vehicles, which the agency interprets broadly to allow regulation of HD engines in addition to HD vehicles, and provided requirements new to 49 U.S.C. 32902 in terms of timing of regulations, stating that the standards adopted as a result of the agency's rulemaking shall provide not less than four full model years of regulatory lead time, and three full model years of regulatory stability., 646609=A manufacturer whose fleet generates credits in a given model year will have several options for using those credits to offset emissions from other HD pickups and vans. These options include credit carry-back, credit carry-forward, and credit trading. These provisions exist in the light-duty 2012-2016 MY vehicle rule, and similar provisions are part of EPA's Tier 2 program for light-duty vehicle criteria pollutant emissions, as well as many other mobile source standards issued by EPA under the CAA. The manufacturer will be able to carry back credits to offset a deficit that had accrued in a prior model year and was subsequently carried over to the current model year, with a limitation on the carry-back of credits to three model years, consistent with the light-duty program. We are finalizing the proposed provision that, after satisfying any need to offset pre-existing deficits, a manufacturer may bank remaining credits for use in future years, with a limitation on the carry-forward of credits to five model years. We are also finalizing the proposed provision that manufacturers may certify their HD pickup and van fleet a year early, in MY 2013, to generate credits against the MY 2014 standards. This averaging, banking, and trading program for HD pickups and vans is discussed in more detail in Section IV.A. For reasons discussed in detail in that section, we are not finalizing any credit transferability to or from other credit programs or averaging sets., 931528=Low Friction Transmission, Axle, and Wheel Bearing Lubricants: The 2010 NAS report assessed low friction lubricants for the drivetrain as a 1 percent improvement in fuel consumption based on fleet testing. [212] The light-duty 2012-16 MY vehicle rule and the pickup truck portion of this program estimate that low friction lubricants can have an effectiveness value between 0 and 1 percent compared to traditional lubricants. However, it is not clear if in many heavy-duty applications these low friction lubricants could have competing requirements like component durability issues requiring specific lubricants with different properties than low friction., 936396=Navistar also stated that the baseline engines proposed in the NPRM, MY 2010 selective catalytic reduction (SCR)-equipped, could not meet the agencies' statutory obligation to set feasible standards, and requested instead that MY 2010 engines currently in-use be used to meet the feasibility factor. The agencies thus disagree with the statement that SCR is infeasible and therefore, the agencies reaffirm that the engine used as the baseline engine in the agencies' analysis does indeed exist. In fact, several engine families have been certified by EPA using SCR technology over the past two years, all of which have met the 0.20 g/bhp-hr NO X standard. [214] EPA disagrees with Navistar that SCR engines currently certified do not meet this standard. Compliance with the 0.20 g/bhp-hr FTP NO X standard is measured based on an engine's performance when tested over a specific duty cycle (see 40 CFR 86.007-11(a)(2)). This is also true regarding the SET standard (see 40 CFR 86.007-11(a)(3)). Further, the FTP and SET tests are average tests, so emissions could go over 0.20 even for some portion of the test itself. Manufacturers are also required to ensure that their engines meet the NTE standard under all conditions specified in the regulations (see 40 CFR 86.007-11(a)(4))., 282371=For the 2014 to 2016 model years, manufacturers may also choose to meet alternative engine standards that are phased-in over the model years to coincide with new EPA On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) requirements applicable for these same model years. See Sections II.B and II.D below., 485367=EPA is also finalizing the proposed provisions requiring that the useful life for these engine and vehicles with respect to GHG emissions be set equal to the respective useful life periods for criteria pollutants. EPA is adopting provisions where the existing engine useful life periods, as included in Table II-6, be broadened to include CO 2 emissions for both engines (See 40 CFR 1036.108(d)) and tractors (See 40 CFR 1037.105)., 236419=The agencies are adopting test metrics that express fuel consumption and GHG emissions relative to the most important measures of heavy-duty truck utility for each segment, consistent with the recommendation of the 2010 NAS Report that metrics should reflect and account for the work performed by various types of HD vehicles. This approach differs from NHTSA's light-duty program that uses fuel economy as the basis. The NAS committee discussed the difference between fuel economy (a measure of how far a vehicle will go on a gallon of fuel) and fuel consumption (the inverse measure, of how much fuel is consumed in driving a given distance) as potential metrics for MD/HD regulations. The committee concluded that fuel economy would not be a good metric for judging the fuel efficiency of a heavy-duty vehicle, and stated that NHTSA should instead consider fuel consumption as the metric for its standards. As a result, for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, EPA and NHTSA are finalizing standards on a per-mile basis (g/mile for the EPA standards, gallons/100 miles for the NHTSA standards), as explained in Section 0 below. For heavy-duty trucks, both combination and vocational, the agencies are adopting standards expressed in terms of the key measure of freight movement, tons of payload miles or, more simply, ton-miles. Hence, for EPA the final standards are in the form of the mass of emissions from carrying a ton of cargo over a distance of one mile (g/ton-mi). Similarly, the final NHTSA standards are in terms of gallons of fuel consumed over a set distance (one thousand miles), or gal/1,000 ton-mile. Finally, for engines, EPA is adopting standards in the form of grams of emissions per unit of work (g/bhp-hr), the same metric used for the heavy-duty highway engine standards for criteria pollutants today. Similarly, NHTSA is finalizing standards for heavy-duty engines in the form of gallons of fuel consumption per 100 units of work (gal/100 bhp-hr)., 265174=NHTSA is allowing manufacturers to select one of two fuel consumption standard alternatives for model years 2016 and later. The first alternative defines individual gasoline vehicle and diesel vehicle fuel consumption target curves that will not change for model years 2016-2018, and are equivalent to EPA's 67-67-67-100 percent target curves in model years 2016-2017-2018-2019, respectively. The target curves for this alternative are presented in Section II.C. The second alternative uses target curves that are equivalent to the EPA's 40-60-100 percent target curves in model years 2016-2017-2018, respectively. Stringency for the alternatives has been selected to allow a manufacturer, through the use of the credit and deficit carry-forward provisions that the agencies are also finalizing, to rely on the same product plans to satisfy either of these two alternatives, and also EPA requirements. If a manufacturer cannot meet an applicable standard in a given model year, it may make up its shortfall by overcomplying in a subsequent year, called reconciling a credit deficit. NHTSA is also allowing manufacturers to voluntarily opt into the NHTSA HD pickup and van program in model years 2014 or 2015. For these model years, NHTSA's fuel consumption target curves are equivalent to EPA's target curves., 921402=Lower Rolling Resistance Tires: A tire's rolling resistance results from the tread compound material, the architecture and materials of the casing, tread design, the tire manufacturing process, and its operating conditions (surface, inflation pressure, speed, temperature, etc.). Differences in rolling resistance of up to 50 percent have been identified for tires designed to equip the same vehicle. The baseline rolling resistance coefficient for today's fleet is 7.8 kg/metric ton for the steer tire and 8.2 kg/metric ton for the drive tire, based on sales weighting of the top three manufacturers based on market share. [205] Since 2007, SmartWay trucks have had steer tires with rolling resistance coefficients of less than 6.6 kg/metric ton for the steer tire and less than 7.0 kg/metric ton for the drive tire. [206] Low rolling resistance (LRR) drive tires are currently offered in both dual assembly and single wide-base configurations. Single wide tires can offer rolling resistance reduction along with improved aerodynamics and weight reduction. The GEM demonstrates that replacing baseline tractor tires with tires which meet the Bin I level provides approximately a 4 percent reduction in fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions over the prescribed test cycle, as shown in RIA Chapter 2, Figure 2-2., 269031=The form and stringency of the EPA and NHTSA standards curves are based on a set of vehicle, engine, and transmission technologies expected to be used to meet the recently established GHG emissions and fuel economy standards for model year 2012-2016 light-duty vehicles, with full consideration of how these technologies are likely to perform in heavy-duty vehicle testing and use. All of these technologies are already in use or have been announced for upcoming model years in some light-duty vehicle models, and some are in use in a portion of HD pickups and vans as well. The technologies include:, 806325=EPA requested comment on possible alternative CO 2 equivalent approaches to provide near-term flexibility for 2012-14 MY light-duty vehicles. As described below, EPA is finalizing alternative provisions allowing manufacturers to use CO 2 credits, on a CO 2-equivalent (CO 2 eq) basis, to meet the N 2 O and CH 4 standards, which is consistent with many commenters' preferred approach., 365424=In EISA, Congress required NHTSA to prescribe separate average fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks in accordance with the provisions in 49 U.S.C. Section 32902(b), and to prescribe standards for work trucks and commercial medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in accordance with the provisions in 49 U.S.C. 32902(k). See 49 U.S.C. Section 32902(b)(1). Congress also added in EISA a requirement that NHTSA shall issue regulations prescribing fuel economy standards for at least 1, but not more than 5, model years. See 49 U.S.C. 32902(b)(3)(B). For purposes of the fuel efficiency standards that the agency proposed for HD vehicles and engines, the NPRM stated an interpretation of the statute that the 5-year maximum limit did not apply to standards promulgated in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 32902(k), given the language in Section 32902(b)(1). Based on this interpretation, NHTSA proposed that the standards ultimately finalized for HD vehicles and engines would remain in effect indefinitely at their 2018 or 2019 model year levels until amended by a future rulemaking action. In any future rulemaking action to amend the standards, NHTSA would ensure not less than four full model years of regulatory lead-time and three full model years of regulatory stability. NHTSA sought comment on its interpretation of EISA., 462219=The agencies recognize, however, that the schedule of changes for the final standards may not be the most cost-effective one for all manufacturers. The agencies also sought comment as to whether an alternate phase-in schedule for the HD diesel engine standards for combination tractors should be considered. In developing the proposal, heavy-duty engine manufacturers stated that the phase-in of the GHG and fuel consumption standards should be aligned with the On Board Diagnostic (OBD) [67] phase-in schedule, which includes new requirements for heavy-duty vehicles in the 2013 and 2016 model years. The agencies did not adopt this suggestion in the proposal, explaining that the credit averaging, banking and trading provisions would provide manufacturers with considerable flexibility to manage their GHG and fuel efficiency standard compliance plans\u2014including the phase-in of the new heavy-duty OBD requirements\u2014but requested comment on whether EPA and NHTSA should provide an alternate phase-in schedules that would more explicitly accommodate this request in the event that manufacturers did not agree that the ABT provisions mitigated their concern about the GHG/fuel consumption standard phase-in. See 75 FR at 74178., 802327=EPA and NHTSA are finalizing an approach to defer greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption standards from small vocational vehicle chassis manufacturers meeting the SBA size criteria of a small business as described in 13 CFR 121.201 (see 40 CFR 1036.150 and 1037.150). The agencies will instead consider appropriate GHG and fuel consumption standards for these entities as part of a future regulatory action. This includes both U.S.-based and foreign small volume heavy-duty truck and engine manufacturers., 916917=In this section we discuss the baseline tractor and engine technologies for the 2010 model year, and then discuss the types of technologies that the agencies considered to improve performance relative to this baseline, while Section III.A.2 discusses the technology packages the agencies used to determine the final standard levels., 858628=In response to comments from manufacturers and from the Natural Gas Vehicle Interests that the changes to the program make sense and should be made on a permanent basis (i.e. for model years after 2016), EPA is extending this flexibility through MY 2016 as discussed above, but we believe it is premature to decide here whether or not these changes should be permanent. EPA may consider this issue further in the context of new standards for MYs 2017-2025 in the planned future light-duty vehicle rulemaking. With regard to comments on changing the test procedures over which N 2 O and CH 4 emissions are measured to determine compliance with the standards, the level of the standards and the test procedures go hand-in-hand and must be considered together. Weighting the highway test result with the city test result in the emissions measurement would in most cases reduce the overall emissions levels for determining compliance with the standards, and would thereby, in effect make the standards less stringent. This appears to be inappropriate. In addition, EPA did not request comments on changing the level of the N 2 O and CH 4 standards or the test procedures and it is inappropriate to amend the standards for that reason as well., 773773=As discussed above, the agencies are taking the approach of using CRR for the HD fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas program to align with the measurement methodology already employed or proposed by the EPA SmartWay program, the European Union Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 [162] and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) through a staff recommendation for a California regulation. [163] In the NPRM, the agencies proposed to use CRR, but for purposes of developing these final rules, the agencies also evaluated whether to use CRR or Rolling Resistance Force (RR F) as the measurement for tire rolling resistance for the GEM input. The agencies considered RR F largely because in the NPRM for Passenger Car Tire Fuel Efficiency (TFE) program, NHTSA had proposed to use RR F. A key distinction between these two programs, and their associated metrics, are the differences in how the measurement data are used and who uses the data. In particular, the HD fuel efficiency and GHG emissions program is a compliance program using information developed by and for technical personnel at manufacturers and agencies to determine a vehicle's compliance with regulations. The TFE program, in contrast, is a consumer education program intended to inform consumers making purchase decisions regarding the fuel saving benefits of replacement passenger car tires. The target audiences are much different for the two programs which in turn affect how the information will be used. The agencies believe that RR F may be more intuitive for non-technical people because tires that are larger and/or that carry higher loads will generally have numerically higher RR F values than smaller tires and/or tires that carry lower loads. CRR values generally follow an opposite trend, where tires that are larger and/or carry higher loads will generally have numerically lower CRR values than smaller tires and/or tires that carry lower loads. The agencies believe this key distinction helps define the type of metrics to be used and communicated in accordance with their respective purposes., 762026=The agencies received many comments on the subject of tire rolling resistance, including suggestions for alternative test procedures and compliance issues. Regarding whether the agencies should base tire CRR inputs for the GEM on the use of the ISO 28580 test procedure, the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC) argued that the agencies should instead require the SAE J2452 Coastdown test method for calculating tire rolling resistance, which the commenter stated was preferred by OEMs because it simulates the use of tires on actual vehicles rather than the ISO procedure which tests the tire by itself. The Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) argued, in contrast, that the agencies should use the SAE J1269 multi-point test, which is currently the basis for the EPA SmartWay [TM] CRR baseline values. RMA also argued that the SAE J1269 multi-point test can be used to accurately predict truck/bus tire CRR at various loads and inflations, including at the ISO 28580 load and inflation conditions, and that therefore the agencies should use the SAE test, or if the agencies want to use ISO, they should accept results from the SAE test and just correlate them. Regarding compliance obligations, RMA further argued that it was not clear how or in what format testing information would need to be provided in order to be in compliance with the proposed requirement at \u00a7 1037.125(i)., 917381=Baseline tractor: The agencies developed the baseline tractor to represent the average 2010 model year tractor. Today there is a large spread in aerodynamics in the new tractor fleet. Trucks sold may reflect so-called classic styling (as described in Section II.B.3.c), or may be sold with aerodynamic packages. Based on our review of current truck model configurations and Polk data provided through MJ Bradley, [202] we believe the aerodynamic configuration of the baseline new truck fleet is approximately 25 percent Bin I, 70 percent Bin II, and 5 percent Bin III (as these bin configurations are explained above in Section II.B. (2)(c). The baseline Class 7 and 8 day cab tractor consists of an aerodynamic package which closely resembles the Bin I package described in Section II.B. (2)(c), baseline tire rolling resistance of 7.8 kg/metric ton for the steer tire and 8.2 kg/metric ton, [203] dual tires with steel wheels on the drive axles, and no vehicle speed limiter. The baseline tractor for the Class 8 sleeper cabs contains the same aerodynamic and tire rolling resistance technologies as the baseline day cab, does not include vehicle speed limiters, and does not include an idle reduction technology. The agencies assume the baseline transmission is a 10 speed manual. The agencies received a comment from the ICCT stating that the 0.69 Cd baseline for high roof sleepers published in the NPRM is higher than existing studies show. ICCT cited three studies including a Society of Automotive Engineering paper showing a lower Cd for tractor trailers. The agencies based the average Cd for high roof sleepers on available in use fleet composition data, combined with an assessment of drag coefficient for different truck configurations. The agencies are finalizing the 0.69 baseline Cd for high roof sleeper based on our assessment for the NPRM. However, we will continue to gather information on the composition of the in-use fleet and may alter the baseline in a future action, should more data become available that demonstrates our estimate is incorrect., 325518=Table I-7 shows the estimated lifetime discounted benefits for all heavy-duty vehicles sold in model years 2014-2018. Although the agencies estimated the benefits associated with four different values of a one ton CO 2 reduction ($5, $22, $36, $66), for the purposes of this overview presentation of estimated benefits the agencies are showing the benefits associated with one of these marginal values, $22 per ton of CO 2, in 2009 dollars and 2010 emissions. Table I-7 presents benefits based on the $22 per ton of CO 2 value. Section VIII.F presents the four marginal values used to estimate monetized benefits of CO 2 reductions and Section VIII presents the program benefits using each of the four marginal values, which represent only a partial accounting of total benefits due to omitted climate change impacts and other factors that are not readily monetized. The values in the table are discounted values for each model year of vehicles throughout their projected lifetimes. The analysis includes other economic impacts such as energy security, and other externalities such as impacts on accidents, congestion and noise. However, the model year lifetime analysis supporting the program omits other impacts such as benefits related to non-GHG emission reductions. [40] The lifetime discounted benefits are shown for one of four different SCC values considered by EPA and NHTSA. The values in Table I-7 do not include costs associated with new technology required to meet the GHG and fuel consumption standards., 494231=The model also includes a new driver model, a simplified electric system model, and revised engine fuel maps to better reflect the 2017 model year engine standards. The model in the final rulemaking uses the targeted vehicle driving speed to estimate vehicle torque demand at any given time, and then the power required to drive the vehicle is derived to estimate the required accelerator and braking pedal positions. If the driver misses the vehicle speed target, a speed correction logic controlled by a PID controller is applied to adjust necessary accelerator and braking pedal positions in order to match targeted vehicle speed at every simulation time step. The enhanced driver model used in the final rulemaking with its feed-forward driver controls more realistically models driving behavior. The GEM v1.0, the proposed version of the model, had four individual components to model the electric system\u2014starter, electrical energy system, alternator, and electrical accessory. For the final rulemaking, the GEM v2.0 has a single electric system model with a constant power consumption level. Based on comments received, the agencies revisited the 2017 model year proposed fuel maps, specifically the low load area, which was extrapolated during the proposal and (incorrectly) generated negative improvements. The agencies redeveloped the fuel maps for the final rulemaking to better predict the fuel consumption of engines in this area of the fuel consumption map. Details of the changes are included in RIA Chapter 4., 448482=The agencies proposed to require diesel engine manufacturers to achieve, on average, a three percent reduction in fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions for the 2014 standards over the baseline MY 2010 performance for the engines. [63] The agencies' preliminary assessment of the findings of the 2010 NAS Report and other literature sources indicated that there are technologies available to reduce fuel consumption by this amount in the time frame in the lead time provided by the rules. These technologies include improved turbochargers, aftertreatment optimization, and low temperature exhaust gas recirculation., 717610=The agencies explained in the NPRM that the standards were based on our assessment of the findings of the 2010 NAS report and other literature sources that there are technologies available to reduce fuel consumption in all these engines by this level in the final time frame in a cost-effective manner. Similar to the technology basis for HD engines used in combination tractors, these technologies include improved turbochargers, aftertreatment optimization, low temperature exhaust gas recirculation, and engine friction reductions., 193427=As in the light-duty 2012-2016 MY vehicle rule, EPA's and NHTSA's final standards for the heavy-duty sector are largely harmonized with one another due to the close and direct relationship between improving the fuel efficiency of these vehicles and reducing their CO 2 tailpipe emissions. For all vehicles that consume carbon-based fuels, the amount of CO 2 exhaust emissions is essentially constant per gallon for a given type of fuel that is consumed. The more efficient a heavy-duty truck is in completing its work, the lower its environmental impact will be, because the less fuel consumed to move cargo a given distance, the less CO 2 that truck emits directly into the air. The technologies available for improving fuel efficiency, and therefore for reducing both CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption, are one and the same. [15] Because of this close technical relationship, NHTSA and EPA have been able to rely on jointly-developed assumptions, analyses, and analytical conclusions to support the standards and other provisions that NHTSA and EPA are adopting under our separate legal authorities., 520678=NHTSA and EPA are finalizing as proposed that the tractor's tire rolling resistance input to the GEM be determined by either the tire manufacturer or tractor manufacturer using the test method adopted by the International Organization for Standardization, ISO 28580:2009. [75] The agencies believe the ISO test procedure is appropriate for this program because the procedure is the same one used by NHTSA in its fuel efficiency tire labeling program [76] and is consistent with the testing direction being taken by the tire industry both in the United States and Europe. The rolling resistance from this test would be used to specify the rolling resistance of each tire on the steer and drive axle of the tractor. The results would be expressed as a rolling resistance coefficient (CRR) and measured as kilogram per metric ton (kg/metric ton). The agencies are finalizing as proposed that three tire samples within each tire model be tested three times each to account for some of the production variability and the average of the nine tests would be the rolling resistance coefficient for the tire. The GEM will use the steer and drive tire rolling resistance inputs and distribute 15 percent of the gross weight of the tractor and trailer to the steer axle, 42.5 percent to the drive axles, and 42.5 percent to the trailer axles. [77] The trailer tires' rolling resistance is prescribed by the agencies as part of the standardized trailer used for demonstrating compliance at 6 kg/metric ton, which was the average trailer tire rolling resistance measured during the SmartWay tire testing. [78], 839383=EPA is adopting a heavy-duty engine CH 4 emission standard of 0.10 g/hp-hr with a defined deterioration factor of 0.02 g/bhp-hr as measured on the composite Heavy-duty FTP, to apply beginning in model year 2014 for diesel engines and in 2016 model year for gasoline engines. EPA is adopting a different CH 4 standard than proposed based on additional data submitted to the agency which better represents the full range of current diesel and gasoline engine performance. EPA is adopting CH 4 standards for gasoline engines that become effective in 2016 model year to align with the first year of the gasoline engine CO 2 standards. Without this alignment, manufacturers would not have any flexibility, such as CO 2 eq credits, in meeting the CH 4 cap and therefore would not be able to sell any engine with a CH 4 level above the standard. The final standard would cap CH 4 emissions at a level currently achieved by diesel and gasoline heavy-duty engines. The level of the standard would generally be achievable through normal emission control methods already required to meet 2007 emission standards for NMHC and EPA is therefore not attributing any cost to this part of this program (see 40 CFR 86.007-11)., 317438=The costs, fuel savings, and benefits summarized here are slightly higher than at proposal, reflecting the use of 2009 (versus 2008) dollars, some minor changes to our cost estimates in response to comments, and a change to the 2011 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) estimate of economic growth and future fuel prices. In aggregate, these changes lead to an increased estimate of the net benefits of the final action compared to the proposal., 343721=The agencies are finalizing three year deficit carry-forward provisions for heavy-duty engines and vehicles within a limited time frame. This flexibility is expected to provide an opportunity for manufacturers to make necessary technological improvements and reduce the overall cost of the program without compromising overall environmental and fuel economy objectives. This flexibility, similar to the flexibility the agencies have offered under the light-duty vehicle program, is intended to assist the broad goal of harmonizing the two agencies' standards while preserving the flexibility of manufacturers of vehicles and engines in meeting the standards, to the extent appropriate and required by law. During the MYs 2014-2018 manufacturers are expected to go through the normal business cycle of redesigning and upgrading their heavy-duty engine and vehicle products, and in some cases introducing entirely new vehicles and engines not on the market today. As explained in the following paragraph, the carry-forward provision will allow manufacturers the time needed to incorporate technology to achieve GHG reductions and improve fuel economy during the vehicle redesign process., 336234=Both costs and benefits presented in this section are in comparison to a reference case with no improvements in fuel consumption or greenhouse gas emissions in model years 2014 to 2018., 479409=The agencies note again that manufacturers choosing to utilize this option in MYs 2014-2016 will have to make a greater relative improvement in MY 2017 than the rest of the industry, since they will be starting from a worse level\u2014for compliance purposes, emissions from engines certified and sold at the three percent level will be averaged with emissions from engines certified and sold at more stringent levels to arrive at a weighted average emissions for all engines in the subcategory. Again, this option can only be taken if all other credit opportunities have been exhausted and the manufacturer still cannot meet the primary standards. If a manufacturer chooses this option to meet the EPA emission standards in the MY 2014-2016, and wants to opt into the NHTSA fuel consumption program in these same MYs it must follow the exact path followed under the EPA program utilizing equivalent fuel consumption standards. Since the NHTSA standards are optional in 2014, manufacturers may choose not to adopt either the alternative engine standard or the regular voluntary standard by not participating in the NHTSA program in 2014 and 2015., 783714=Clean Air Task Force said the agencies have not adequately addressed the diversity of the vocational vehicle fleet since they are not distinguished by different duty cycles. They urged the agencies to sub-divide vocational vehicles by expected use, with separate test cycles for each sub-group in order to capture the full potential benefits of hybridization and other advanced technologies in a meaningful and accurate way in future rulemakings for MY2019 and later trucks., 302534=The American Trucking Association expressed support for estimating natural gas fuel efficiency by using carbon emissions from natural gas rather than energy content to estimate fuel consumption. ATA explained that two vehicles can achieve the same fuel efficiency, yet one operated on natural gas would have a lower carbon dioxide emissions rate. A natural gas conversion factor that uses carbon content versus energy content is a more appropriate method for calculating fuel consumption, in the commenter's view. A number of other groups commented on the appropriate method to use in establishing fuel consumption from alternative fueled vehicles. A group of NGV interests, Ryder, Border Valley Trading, Waste Management, Robert Bosch and the Blue Green Alliance encouraged the agencies to adopt the 0.15 conversion factor in estimating fuel consumption for FFVs and alternative fuel vehicles finalized in the light-duty 2012-2016 MY vehicle standards. The suggested incentive would effectively reduce the calculated fuel consumption for FFVs and alternative fuel vehicles by a factor of 85 percent. The commenters argued that the incentive is needed for heavy-duty vehicles to encourage the use of natural gas and to reduce the nation's dependence on petroleum., 435763=NHTSA is finalizing Class 7 and 8 tractor fuel consumption standards that are voluntary standards in the 2014 and 2015 model years and become mandatory beginning in the 2016 model year, as required by the lead time within EISA. The 2014 and 2015 model year standards are voluntary in that manufacturers are not subject to them unless they opt-in to the standards. [58] Manufacturers that opt in become subject to NHTSA standards for all regulatory categories. NHTSA is also adopting new tractor standards for the 2017 model year which reflect additional improvements in only the heavy-duty engines. As proposed, NHTSA is not implementing an in-use compliance program for fuel consumption because it does not anticipate that there will be notable deterioration of fuel consumption over the useful life of the vehicle., 653708=Similar to combination tractors, the agencies proposed to set separate vehicle and engine standards for vocational vehicles. A number of comments were received on the proposal to regulate chassis and engine manufacturers. The agencies received comments from DTNA supporting the proposal to regulate the chassis manufacturer but not body manufacturers. While organizations like Cummins and ICCT expressed support for separate engine and vehicle standards, Navistar, Pew, and Volvo, in contrast, opposed separate engine and chassis standards, stating that separate engine standards disadvantages integrated truck/engine manufacturers and full vehicle standards should be required. Volvo asked that the standards include an alternative integrated standard as well as complete vehicle modeling and testing beginning in 2017. ACEEE and Sierra Club stated that the proposed standards and test procedures should move the agencies closer to full vehicle testing., 847011=For light-duty vehicles, as part of the MY 2012-2016 rulemaking, EPA finalized standards for N 2 O and CH 4 which take effect with MY 2012. 75 FR at 25421-24. Similar to the heavy-duty standards discussed in Section II.E above, the light-duty vehicle standards for N 2 O and CH 4 were established to cap emissions and to prevent future emissions increases, and were generally not expected to result in the application of new technologies or significant costs for the manufacturers for current vehicle designs. EPA also finalized an alternative CO 2 equivalent standard option, which manufacturers may choose to use in lieu of complying with the N 2 O and CH 4 cap standards. The CO 2 equivalent standard option allows manufacturers to fold all N 2 O and CH 4 emissions, on a CO 2 eq basis, along with CO 2 into their otherwise applicable CO 2 emissions standard level. For flexible fueled vehicles, the N 2 O and CH 4 standards must be met on both fuels (e.g., both gasoline and E-85)., 621790=These targets are based on a set of vehicle, engine, and transmission technologies assessed by the agencies and determined to be feasible and appropriate for HD pickups and vans in the 2014-2018 timeframe. See Section III.B for a detailed analysis of these vehicle, engine and transmission technologies, including their feasibility, costs, and effectiveness in HD pickups and vans., 255182=However, the final heavy-duty A/C provisions differ in two important ways from those established in the light-duty rule. First, the light-duty provisions were established as voluntary ways to generate credits towards the CO 2 g/mi standard, and EPA took into account the expected use of such credits in determining the stringency of the CO 2 emissions standards. In the HD National Program, EPA is requiring that manufacturers actually meet a standard\u2014as opposed to having the opportunity to earn a credit\u2014for A/C refrigerant leakage. Thus, refrigerant leakage control is not separately accounted for in the final heavy-duty CO 2 standards. We are taking this approach here recognizing that while the benefits of leakage control are almost identical between light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles on a per vehicle basis, these benefits on a per mile basis expressed as a percentage of overall GHG emissions are much smaller for heavy-duty vehicles due to their much higher CO 2 emissions rates and higher annual mileage when compared to light-duty vehicles. Hence a credit-based approach as done for light-duty vehicles would provide less motivation for manufacturers to install low leakage systems even though such systems represent a highly cost effective means to control GHG emissions. The second difference relates to the expression of the leakage rate. The light-duty A/C leakage standard is expressed in terms of grams per year. For EPA's heavy-duty program, however, because of the wide variety of system designs and arrangements, a one-size-fits-all gram per year standard would not be appropriate, so EPA is adopting a standard in terms of annual mass leakage rate for A/C systems with refrigerant capacities less than or equal to 733 grams and percent of total refrigerant leakage per year for A/C systems with refrigerant capacities greater than 733 grams. The percent of total refrigerant leakage per year requires the total refrigerant capacity of the A/C system to be taken into account in determining compliance. EPA believes that this approach\u2014a standard instead of a credit, and basing the standard on percent or mass of leakage over time\u2014is more appropriate for heavy-duty tractors than the light-duty vehicle approach and that it will achieve the desired reductions in refrigerant leakage. Compliance with the standard will be determined through a showing by the tractor manufacturer that its A/C system incorporates a combination of low-leak technologies sufficient to meet the leakage rate of the applicable standard. The \u201cmenu\u201d of technologies is very similar to that established in the light-duty 2012-2016 MY vehicle rule. [28], 718190=The agencies proposed that the HD diesel engine CO 2 standards for vocational vehicles would become effective in MY 2014 for EPA, with more stringent CO 2 standards becoming effective in MY 2017, while NHTSA's fuel consumption standards would become effective in MY 2017, which would be both consistent with the EISA four-year minimum lead-time requirements and harmonized with EPA's timing for stringency increases. The agencies explained that the three-year timing, besides being required by EISA, made sense because EPA's heavy-duty highway engine program for criteria pollutants had begun to provide new emissions standards for the industry in three year increments, which had caused the heavy-duty engine and vehicle manufacturer product plans to fall largely into three year cycles reflecting this regulatory environment. [141] To further harmonize with EPA, NHTSA proposed voluntary fuel consumption standards for HD diesel engines for vocational vehicles in MYs 2014-2016, allowing manufacturers to opt into the voluntary standards in any of those model years. [142] Manufacturers opting into the program must declare by statement their intent to comply prior to or at the same time they submit their first application for a certificate of conformity. A manufacturer opting into the program would begin tracking credits and debits beginning in the model year in which they opt in. Both agencies proposed to allow manufacturers to generate and use credits to achieve compliance with the HD diesel engine standards for vocational vehicles, including averaging, banking, and trading (ABT), and deficit carry-forward., 323072=Table I-6 shows the estimated lifetime reductions in CO 2 emissions (in million metric tons (MMT)) and fuel consumption for all heavy-duty vehicles sold in the model years 2014-2018. The values in Table I-6 are projected lifetime totals for each model year and are not discounted. The two agencies' standards together comprise the HD National Program, and the agencies' respective GHG emissions and fuel consumption standards, jointly, are the source of the benefits and costs of the HD National Program., 334525=Table I-10 shows the agencies' estimated incremental cost increase of the average new heavy-duty vehicle for each model year 2014-2018. The values shown are incremental to a baseline vehicle and are not cumulative., 54662=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 1, 2015, 751805=EPA proposed that the useful life for these engines and vehicles with respect to GHG emissions be set equal to the respective useful life periods for criteria pollutants. EPA proposed that the existing engine useful life periods, as included in Table II-21, be broadened to include CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption for both engines and vocational vehicles. The agency did not receive any adverse comments with this approach and is finalizing the useful life periods as proposed (see 40 CFR 1036.108(d) and 1037.105). While NHTSA will use useful life considerations for establishing fuel consumption performance for initial compliance and for ABT, NHTSA does not intend to implement an in-use compliance program for fuel consumption, because it is not required under EISA and because it is not currently anticipated there will be notable deterioration of fuel consumption over the engines' useful life., 980263=The final aerodynamic application for the other tractor regulatory categories is less aggressive than for the Class 8 sleeper cab high roof. The agencies recognize that there are truck applications which require on/off-road capability and other truck functions which restrict the type of aerodynamic equipment applicable. We also recognize that these types of trucks spend less time at highway speeds where aerodynamic technologies have the greatest benefit. The 2002 VIUS data ranks trucks by major use. [227] The heavy trucks usage indicates that up to 35 percent of the trucks may be used in on/off-road applications or heavier applications. The uses include construction (16 percent), agriculture (12 percent), waste management (5 percent), and mining (2 percent). Therefore, the agencies analyzed the technologies to evaluate the potential restrictions that would prevent 100 percent application of SmartWay technologies for all of the tractor regulatory subcategories., 263574=As proposed, the agencies are adopting provisions such that each manufacturer's fleet average standard will be based on production volume-weighting of target standards for all vehicles that in turn are based on each vehicle's work factor. These target standards are taken from a set of curves (mathematical functions), presented in Section II.C below and in \u00a7 1037.104. EPA is also phasing in the CO 2 standards gradually starting in the 2014 model year, at 15-20-40-60-100 percent of the model year 2018 standards stringency level in model years 2014-2015-2016-2017-2018, respectively. The phase-in takes the form of a set of target standard curves, with increasing stringency in each model year, as detailed in Section II.C. The final EPA standards for 2018 (including a separate standard to control air conditioning system leakage) represent an average per-vehicle reduction in GHGs of 17 percent for diesel vehicles and 12 percent for gasoline vehicles, compared to a common baseline, as described in Sections II.C and III.B of this preamble. The rule contains separate standards for diesel and gasoline heavy duty pickups and vans for reasons described in Section II.C below. EPA is also finalizing a compliance alternative whereby manufacturers can phase in different percentages: 15-20-67-67-67-100 percent of the model year 2019 standards stringency level in model years 2014-2015-2016-2017-2018-2019, respectively. This compliance alternative parallels and is equivalent to NHTSA's first alternative described below., 857140=In EPA's request for comments, EPA discussed the new flexibility as being needed to address lead time issues for MYs 2012-2014. EPA understands that manufacturers are now making technology decisions for beyond MY 2014 and that some technologies such as FFVs may have difficulty meeting the CH 4 and N 2 O standards, presenting manufacturers with difficult decisions of absorbing the 3-4 g/mile CO 2-equivalent emissions fleet wide, making significant investments in existing vehicle technologies, or curtailing the use of certain technologies. [186] The CH 4 standard, in particular, could prove challenging for FFVs because exhaust temperatures are lower on E-85 and CH 4 is more difficult to convert over the catalyst. EPA's initial estimate that these issues could be resolved without disrupting product plans by MY 2015 appears to be overly optimistic, and therefore EPA is extending the flexibility through model year 2016. This change helps ensure that the CH 4 and N 2 O standards will not be an obstacle for the use of FFVs or other technologies in this timeframe, and at the same time, assure that overall fleet average GHG emissions will remain at the same level as under the main standards., 385049=While we are now only finalizing this first step, it is worthwhile to consider how the next regulatory step may be designed. Technologies such as hybrid drivetrains, advanced bottoming cycle engines, and full electric vehicles are promoted in this first step through incentive concepts as discussed in Section IV, but we believe that these advanced technologies will not be necessary to meet the final standards. Today's standards are premised on the use of existing technologies given the short lead time, as discussed in Section III, below. When we begin work to develop a possible next set of regulatory standards, the agencies expect these advanced technologies to be an important part of the regulatory program and will consider them in setting the stringency of any standards beyond the 2018 model year., 412140=(5) A total reduction in low gear greater than or equal to 57:1., 505282=Therefore, we are finalizing an approach, as described in Section V.B.3.d and \u00a7 1037.501, which uses an enhanced coastdown procedure as a reference method and defines a process for manufacturers to align drag results from each of their own test methods to the reference method results. Manufacturers will be able to use any aerodynamic evaluation method in demonstrating a vehicle's aerodynamic performance as long as the method is aligned to the reference method. The results from the aerodynamic testing will be the single determining factor for aerodynamic bin assignments., 926483=As explained in Section II.B above, the agencies continue to believe that the 400 pound weight target is appropriate for setting the final combination tractor CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption standards. The agencies agree with the commenter that 400 pounds of weight reduction without the use of single wide tires may not be achievable for all tractor configurations. The agencies have expanded the list of weight reduction components which can be input into the GEM in order to provide the manufacturers with additional means to comply with the combination tractors and to further encourage reductions in vehicle weight. The agencies considered increasing the target value beyond 400 pounds given the additional reduction potential identified in the expanded technology list; however, lacking information on the capacity for the industry to change to these light weight components across the board by the 2014 model year, we have decided to maintain the 400 pound target. The agencies intend to continue to study the potential for additional weight reductions in our future work considering a second phase of truck fuel efficiency and GHG regulations., 608534=To ensure consistency and help preclude gaming, we are finalizing the proposed provision that payload capacity be defined as GVWR minus curb weight, and towing capacity as GCWR minus GVWR. For purposes of determining the work factor, GCWR is defined according to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Recommended Practice J2807 APR2008, GVWR is defined consistent with EPA's criteria pollutants program, and curb weight is defined as in 40 CFR 86.1803-01. Based on analysis of how CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption correlate to work factor, we believe that a straight line correlation is appropriate across the spectrum of possible HD pickups and vans, and that vehicle distinctions such as Class 2b versus Class 3 need not be made in setting standards levels for these vehicles. [113] This approach was supported by commenters., 582368=As proposed, the agencies are defining the engine characteristics used in the GEM, including the fuel consumption map which provides the fuel consumption at hundreds of engine speed and torque points. If the agencies did not standardize the fuel map, then a tractor that uses an engine with emissions and fuel consumption better than the standards would require fewer vehicle reductions than those technically feasible reductions reflected in the final standards. The agencies are finalizing two distinct fuel consumption maps for use in the GEM. The first fuel consumption map would be used in the GEM for the 2014 through 2016 model years and represents an average engine which meets EPA's final 2014 model year engine CO 2 emissions standards. The same fuel map would be used for NHTSA's voluntary standards in the 2014 and 2015 model years, as well as its mandatory program in the 2016 model year. A second fuel consumption map will be used beginning in the 2017 model year and represents an engine which meets the 2017 model year CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption standards and accounts for the increased stringency in the final MY 2017 standard. The agencies have modified the 2017 MY fuel map used in the GEM for the final rulemaking to address comments received. Details regarding this change can be found in RIA Chapter 4.4.4. Effectively there is no change in stringency of the tractor vehicle (not including the engine standards over the full rulemaking period). [106] These inputs are appropriate given the separate regulatory requirement that Class 7 and 8 combination tractor manufacturers use only certified engines., 185128=The agencies proposed to cover all segments of the heavy-duty category above, except with respect to recreational vehicles (RVs or motor homes). We note that the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires NHTSA to set standards for \u201ccommercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work trucks.\u201d [7] The standards that EPA is finalizing today cover recreational on-highway vehicles, while NHTSA proposed not to include recreational vehicles based on an interpretation of the term \u201ccommercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway commercial\u201d vehicles. NHTSA stated in the NPRM that recreational vehicles are non-commercial, and therefore outside of the term and the scope of its rule., 950387=The agencies developed the baseline tractor for each subcategory to represent an average 2010 model year tractor configured as noted earlier. The approach taken by the agencies was to define the individual inputs to the GEM, as shown in Table III-1. For example, the agencies evaluated the industry's tractor offerings and concluded that the average tractor contains a generally aerodynamic shape (such as roof fairings) and avoids classic features such as an exhaust stacks at the B-pillar, which increases drag. As noted earlier, our assessment of the baseline new high roof tractor fleet aerodynamics consists of approximately 25 percent Bin I, 70 percent Bin II, and 5 percent Bin III tractors. The baseline rolling resistance coefficient for today's fleet is 7.8 kg/metric ton for the steer tire and 8.2 kg/metric ton for the drive tire, based on sales weighting of the top three manufacturers based on market share. [225] The agencies assumed no application of vehicle speed limiters, weight reduction technologies, or idle reduction technologies in the baseline tractor. The agencies use the inputs in the GEM to derive the baseline CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption of Class 7 and 8 tractors. The results are included in Table III-1., 298529=The agencies believe that it is also appropriate to take steps to recognize the benefits of flexible-fueled vehicles (FFVs) and dedicated alternative-fueled vehicles. In the NPRM, EPA proposed to determine the emissions performance of dedicated alternative fuel engines and pickup trucks and vans by measuring tailpipe CO 2 emissions. NHTSA proposed to determine fuel consumption performance of non-electric dedicated alternative fuel engines and pickup trucks and vans by measuring fuel consumption with the alternative fuel and then calculating a petroleum equivalent fuel consumption using a Petroleum Equivalency Factor (PEF) that is determined by the Department of Energy. NHTSA proposed to treat electric vehicles as having zero fuel consumption, comparable to the EPA proposal. Both agencies proposed to determine FFV performance in the same way as for GHG emissions for light-duty vehicles, with a 50-50 weighting of alternative and conventional fuel test results through MY 2015, and a weighting based on demonstrated fuel use in the real world after MY 2015 (defaulting to an assumption of 100 percent conventional fuel use). This approach was considered to be a reasonable and logical way to properly credit alternative fuel use in FFVs in the real world without imposing a difficult burden of proof on manufacturers. However, unlike in the light-duty rule, the agencies do not believe it is appropriate to create a provision for additional incentives similar to the 2012-2015 light-duty incentive program (See 49 U.S.C. 32904) because the HD sector does not have the incentives mandated in EISA for light-duty FFVs, and so has not relied on the existence of such credits in devising compliance strategies for the early model years of this program. See 74 FR at 49531. In fact, manufacturers have not in the past produced FFV heavy-duty vehicles. On the other hand, the agencies sought comment on how to properly recognize the impact of the use of alternative fuels, and E85 in particular, in HD pickups and vans, including the proper accounting for alternative fuel use in FFVs in the real world. [36] See 75 FR at 74198., 382271=Finally, NHTSA believes that if Congress had intended for a pre-determined penalty scheme to apply to the new HD program, it would have been specific. Instead, Congress explicitly directed the agency to develop a new measurement, compliance, and enforcement scheme. Consistent with the statutory interpretation of the duration of the standards, NHTSA believes that if Congress intended for particular penalty levels to be used in Section 32902(k)(3), it would have either included a reference to those levels or included a reference in 32912 to the vehicles and metrics regulated by 32902(k)(3). See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983), quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir 1972) (\u201c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d) Instead, the absence of such language could mean either that Congress did not contemplate the specific penalty levels to be used, or that Congress left the choice of specific penalty levels to the agency. See Alliance for Community Media v. F.C.C. 529 F. 3d 763, 779 (6th Cir. 2008) (absence of a statutory deadline in one section but not others meant that Congress authorized but did not require it in that section)., 390520=EPA and NHTSA are finalizing standards for heavy-duty engines and also for what we refer to generally as \u201cheavy-duty vehicles.\u201d In general, these standards will apply for the model year 2014 and later engines and vehicles, although some standards do not apply until 2016 or 2017. The EPA standards will apply throughout the useful life of the engine or vehicle, just as existing criteria emission standards apply throughout the useful life. As noted in Section I, for purposes of this preamble and rules, the term \u201cheavy-duty or \u201cHD\u201d applies to all highway vehicles and engines that are not regulated by the light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck and medium-duty passenger vehicle greenhouse gas and CAFE standards issued for MYs 2012-2016. Thus, in this notice, unless specified otherwise, the heavy-duty category incorporates all vehicles rated with GVWR greater than 8,500 pounds, and the engines that power these vehicles, except for MDPVs. The CAA defines heavy-duty vehicles as trucks, buses or other motor vehicles with GVWR exceeding 6,000 pounds. See CAA section 202(b)(3). In the context of the CAA, the term HD as used in these final rules thus refers to a subset of these vehicles and engines. EISA section 103(a)(3) defines a `commercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicle' as an on-highway vehicle with GVWR of 10,000 pounds or more. [50] EISA section 103(a)(6) defines a `work truck' as a vehicle that is rated at between 8,500 and 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight and is not a medium-duty passenger vehicle. [51] Therefore, the term \u201cheavy-duty vehicles\u201d in this rulemaking refers to both work trucks and commercial medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles as defined by EISA. Heavy-duty engines affected by the standards are those that are installed in commercial medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, except for the engines installed in vehicles certified to a complete vehicle emissions standard based on a chassis test, which would be addressed as a part of those complete vehicles, and except for engines used exclusively for stationary power when the vehicle is parked. The agencies' scope is the same with the exception of recreational vehicles (or motor homes), as discussed above. The standards that EPA is finalizing today cover recreational on-highway vehicles, while NHTSA limited its scope in the proposal to not include these vehicles. See Section I.A above., 769943=RMA also commented that the extra burden proposed by the agencies for testing three tires, three times each is nine times more burdensome than what is required through the ISO procedure. Since the proposal, EPA obtained replicate test data for a number of Class 8 combination tractor tires from various manufacturers. Some of these were tires submitted to SmartWay for verification, while some were tires tested by manufacturers for other purposes. Three tire model samples for 11 tire models were tested using the ISO 28580 test. [159] A mean and a standard deviation were calculated for each set of three replicate measurements performed on each tire of the 3-tire sample. The coefficient of variability (COV) of the CRR was calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean. The values of COV ranged from 0 percent (no measurable variability) to six percent. In addition, during the period September 2010 and June 2011, EPA contracted with Smithers-Rapra to select and test for rolling resistance using ISO 28580 for a representative sample of Class 4-8 vocational vehicle tires. As part of the test, 10 tires were selected for replicate testing. [160] Three replicate tests were conducted for each of the tires, to evaluate test variability only. The COV of the RR C results ranged from nearly 0 to 2 percent, with a mean of less than 1 percent. Based on the results of these two testing programs, the agencies determined that the impact of production variability is greater than the impact of measurement variability. Thus, the agencies concluded that the extra burden of testing a single tire three times was not necessary to obtain accurate results, but the variability of RR C results due to manufacturing of the tires is significant to continue to require testing of three tire samples for each tire model. In summary, we are allowing manufacturers to determine the rolling resistance coefficient of the heavy-duty tires by testing three tire samples one time each., 463582=In response, Cummins, Engine Manufacturers Association, and DTNA commented that their first choice was a delay in the OBD effective date for one year to the 2014 model year. The industry's second choice was to provide manufacturers with an optional GHG and fuel consumption phase-in that aligns their product development plans with their current plans to meet the OBD regulations for EPA and California in the 2013 and 2016 model years. These commenters argued that meeting the OBD regulation in the 2013 model year already poses a significant challenge, and that having to meet GHG and fuel consumption standards beginning in 2014 could require them to redesign and recertify their products just one year later. They argued that bundling design changes where possible can reduce the burden on industry for complying with regulations, so aligning the introduction of the OBD, GHG, and fuel consumption standards could help reduce manufacturers' burden for product development, validation and certification., 282694=The agencies received a significant number of comments including from the Senate authors and supporters of the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act arguing that our proposed standards for vocational vehicles did not reflect all of the technologies identified in the 2010 NAS report. The commenters encouraged the agencies to expand the program to bring in additional reductions through the use of new transmission technologies, vehicle weight reductions and hybrid drivetrains. In general, the agencies agree with the commenters' central contention that there are additional technologies to improve the fuel efficiency of vocational vehicles. As discussed later, we are finalizing provisions to allow new technologies to be brought into the program through the innovative technology credit program. More specifically, we are including provisions to account for and credit the use of hybrid technology as a technology that can reduce emissions and fuel consumption. Hybrid technology can currently be a cost-effective technology in certain specific vocational applications, and the agencies want to recognize and promote the use of this technology. (See Sections I.E and IV below.) However, we are not finalizing standards that are premised on the use of these additional technologies because we have not been able to develop the test procedures, regulatory mechanisms and baseline performance data necessary to adopt a more comprehensive approach to controlling fuel efficiency and GHG emissions from vocational vehicles. In concept, the agencies would need to know the baseline weight, aerodynamic performance, and transmission configuration for the wide range of vocational vehicles produced today. We do not have this information even for relatively small portions of this market (e.g. concrete mixers) nor are we well informed regarding the potential tradeoffs to changes to vehicle utility that might exist for changes to concrete mixer designs in response to a regulation. Nor did the commenters provide any such information. Absent this information and the necessary regulatory tools, we believe the standards we are finalizing for vocational vehicles represent the most appropriate standards for this segment during the model years of the first phase of the program. We intend to address fuel consumption and GHG emissions from these vehicles in a more comprehensive manner through future regulation and look forward to working with all stakeholders on this important segment in the future., 161293=These final rules are effective on November 14, 2011. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in this regulation is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 14, 2011., 630899=NHTSA is finalizing the proposed provision to allow manufacturers to select one of two fuel consumption standard alternatives for model years 2016 and later. Each manufacturer will select an alternative in its joint pre-model year report, discussed below, that is now required to be electronically submitted to the agencies; and, once selected, the alternative will apply for model years 2016 and later, and cannot be reversed. The first alternative will define a fuel consumption target line function for gasoline vehicles and a target line function for diesel vehicles that will not change for model years 2016 to 2018. The target line function coefficients are provided in Table II-13., 888454=Section 202(a)(1) of course allows EPA to consider application of technologies which will be available as well as those presently available, id., and EPA exercised that discretion here. For example, as shown below, the agencies carefully considered application of hybrid technologies and bottoming cycle technologies for a number of the standards. Thus, the critical issue is whether EPA's choice of technology penetration on which the standards are premised is reasonable considering the statutory factors, the key ones being technology feasibility, technology availability in the 2014-2018 model years (i.e., adequacy of lead time), and technology cost and cost-effectiveness. EPA has considerable discretion to weigh these factors in a reasonable manner (even for provisions which are explicitly technology-forcing, see Sierra Club v. EPA, 325 F. 3d 374, 378 (DC Cir. 2003)), and has done so here., 963355=The benefits for the extended idle reductions were developed from literature, SmartWay work, and the 2010 NAS report. The agencies received comments from multiple stakeholders regarding idle reduction technologies (IRT). Two commenters asked us to revise the default value associated with the IRT technology, and two commenters want to use IRT in GEM even without automatic engine shut down (AES). The agencies proposed AES after 5 minutes with no exceptions to help ensure that the idle reductions are realized in-use. Use of an AES ensures the main engine will be shut down, whereas idle reduction technologies alone do not provide that level of certainty. Without an automatic shutdown of the main engine, actual savings would depend on operator behavior and thus be essentially unverifiable. The agencies are finalizing the calculation as proposed, along with the automotive engine shutdown requirement. Additional details regarding the comments and calculations are included in RIA Section 2.5.4.2., 79003=3 actions from November 30th, 2010 to August 2011, 816324=EPA is finalizing an N 2 O emission standard that we believe would be met by most current-technology gasoline and diesel vehicles at essentially no cost to the vehicle, though the agency is accounting for additional N 2 O measurement equipment costs. EPA believes that heavy-duty emission standards since 2008 model year, specifically the very stringent NO X standards for both engine and chassis certified engines, directly result in stringent N 2 O control. It is believed that the current emission control technologies used to meet the stringent NO X standards achieve the maximum feasible reductions and that no additional technologies are recognized that would result in additional N 2 O reductions. As noted, N 2 O formation in current catalyst systems occurs, but their emission levels are inherently low, because the time the catalyst spends at the critical temperatures during warm-up when N 2 O can form is short. At the same time, we believe that the standard would ensure that the design of advanced NO X control systems for future diesel and lean-burn gasoline vehicles would control N 2 O emission levels. While current NO X control approaches used on current heavy-duty diesel vehicles do not compromise N 2 O emissions and actually result in N 2 O control, we believe that the standards would discourage any new emission control designs for diesels or lean-burn gasoline vehicles that achieve criteria emissions compliance at the cost of increased N 2 O emissions. Thus, the standard would cap N 2 O emission levels, with the expectation that current gasoline and diesel vehicle control approaches that comply with heavy-duty vehicle emission standards for NO X would not increase their emission levels, and that the cap would ensure that future diesel and lean-burn gasoline vehicles with advanced NO X controls would appropriately control their emissions of N 2 O., 592318=However, the agencies decided not to propose the use of a chassis test procedure to demonstrate compliance for tractor standards due to the significant technical hurdles to implementing such a program by the 2014 model year. The agencies recognize that such testing requires expensive, specialized equipment that is not yet widespread within the industry. The agencies have only identified approximately 11 heavy-duty chassis sites in the United States today and rapid installation of new facilities to comply with model year 2014 is not possible. [108], 474691=Based on the CBI submitted by Navistar, the agencies found that a large majority of the HD diesel engines used in Class 7 and 8 combination tractors were relatively close to the average baseline, with some above and some below, but also that some legacy MHD and HDD diesel engines were far enough away from the baseline that they could not meet the generally-applicable standards with application of technology that would be available for those specific engines by 2014. The agencies continue to believe that an interim alternative standard is needed for these products, and that an interim standard reflects a legitimate difference between products starting from different fuel consumption/GHG emitting baselines. As explained in the proposal, it is legally permissible to accommodate short term lead time constraints with alternative standards. Commenters did not dispute that there are legacy engine families with significantly higher CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption baselines, and that these engines require longer lead time to meet the principal standards in the early model years of the program. Although the agencies acknowledge the view that all manufacturers should be subject to the same burden for meeting the primary standards, the agencies believe that, in the initial years of a new program, additional flexibilities should be provided. The GHG standards and fuel consumption standards are first-time standards for these engines, so the possibility of significantly different baselines is not unexpected. [70] Moreover, the agencies do not believe that the alternative standard affords a relative competitive advantage to the higher emitting legacy engines: the same level of improvement at the same cost will be required of those tractor engines, and in addition, by 2017 MY, those tractor engines will be required to make the additional improvements to meet the same standards as other engines. We believe that the concern expressed by Navistar regarding the 2014 MY standards will be addressed by this alternative. The agencies also continue to believe the 2017 MY standards are achievable using the above approaches and, in the case of MHD and HHD engines installed in tractors, turbocompounding. While Navistar commented that the 2017 MY standard may be challenging, the agencies believe that since manufacturers which may need to use turbocompounding to meet the standards will not have to do so until 2017 MY, there will be sufficient lead time for all engine manufacturers to introduce this technology. Thus, the agencies are finalizing a regulatory alternative whereby a manufacturer, for an interim period of the 2014-2016 model years, would have the option to comply with a unique standard based on a three percent reduction from an individual engine's own 2011 model year baseline level. Our assessment is that this three percent reduction is appropriate given the potential for manufacturers to apply similar technology packages with similar cost to what we have estimated for the primary program. This is similar to EPA's approach in the light-duty rule for handling a certain subset of vehicles that were deemed unable to meet the generally-applicable GHG standards during the 2012-2015 time frame due to higher initial baseline conditions, and which therefore needed alternate standards in those model years. [71], 330111=Table I-8 shows the agencies' estimated lifetime fuel savings, lifetime CO 2 emission reductions, and the monetized net present values of those fuel savings and CO 2 emission reductions. The gallons of fuel and CO 2 emission reductions are projected lifetime values for all vehicles sold in the model years 2014-2018. The estimated fuel savings in billions of barrels and the GHG reductions in million metric tons of CO 2 shown in Table I-8 are totals for the five model years throughout their projected lifetime and are not discounted. The monetized values shown in Table I-8 are the summed values of the discounted monetized-fuel consumption and monetized-CO 2 reductions for the five model years 2014-2018 throughout their lifetimes. The monetized values in Table I-8 reflect both a 3 percent and a 7 percent discount rate as noted., 907588=The agencies worked together to determine component costs for each of the technologies and build up the costs accordingly. For costs, the agencies considered both the direct or \u201cpiece\u201d costs and indirect costs of individual components of technologies. For the direct costs, the agencies followed a bill of materials approach utilized by the agencies in the light-duty 2012-16 MY vehicle rule. A bill of materials, in a general sense, is a list of components or sub-systems that make up a system\u2014in this case, an item of technology which reduces GHG emissions and fuel consumption. In order to determine what a system costs, one of the first steps is to determine its components and what they cost. NHTSA and EPA estimated these components and their costs based on a number of sources for cost-related information. In general, the direct costs of fuel consumption-improving technologies for heavy-duty pickups and vans are consistent with those used in the light-duty 2012-2016 MY vehicle rule, except that the agencies have scaled up certain costs where appropriate to accommodate the larger size and/or loads placed on parts and systems in the heavy-duty classes relative to the light-duty classes. For loose heavy-duty engines, the agencies have consulted various studies and have exercised engineering judgment when estimating direct costs. For technologies expected to be added to vocational vehicles and combination tractors, the agencies have again consulted various studies and have used engineering judgment to arrive at direct cost estimates. Once costs were determined, they were adjusted to ensure that they were all expressed in 2009 dollars using a ratio of gross domestic product deflators for the associated calendar years., 791569=The agencies are finalizing two distinct sets of fuel consumption maps for use in GEM. The first fuel consumption map would be used in GEM for the 2014 through 2016 model years and represent a diesel engine which meets the 2014 model year engine CO 2 emissions standards. A second fuel consumption map would be used beginning in the 2017 model year and represents a diesel engine which meets the 2017 model year CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption standards and accounts for the increased stringency in the final MY 2017 standard). The agencies have modified the 2017 MY heavy heavy-duty diesel fuel map used in the GEM for the final rulemaking to address comments received. Details regarding this change can be found in RIA Chapter 4.4.4. Effectively there is no change in stringency of the vocational vehicle standard (not including the engine) between the 2014 MY and 2017 MY standards for the full rulemaking period. These inputs are reasonable (indeed, seemingly necessitated) given the separate final regulatory requirement that vocational vehicle chassis manufacturers use only certified engines., 961742=The aerodynamic packages are categorized as Bin I, Bin II, Bin III, Bin IV, or Bin V based on the aerodynamic performance determined through testing conducted by the manufacturer. A more complete description of these aerodynamic packages is included in Chapter 2 of the RIA. In general, the CdA values for each package and tractor subcategory were developed through EPA's coastdown testing of tractor-trailer combinations, the 2010 NAS report, and SAE papers., 725031=After consideration of the comments, EPA and NHTSA are adopting as proposed the CO 2 emission standards and fuel consumption standards for heavy-duty diesel engines installed in vocational vehicles are presented in Table II-17. Consistent with proposal, the first set of standards take effect with MY 2014 (mandatory standards for EPA, voluntary standards for NHTSA), and the second set take effect with MY 2017 (mandatory for both agencies)., 54054=On June 2, 2015, the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) hosted its 3rd Annual Federal Register Liaison Conference in the National Archives\u2019 McGowan Theater.

The EPA Administrator found after a thorough examination of the scientific evidence on the causes and impact of current and future climate change, and careful review of public comments, that the science compellingly supports a positive finding that atmospheric concentrations of six greenhouse gases taken in combination result in air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger both public health and welfare and that the combined emissions of these greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and engines contributes to the greenhouse gas air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. In her finding, the Administrator carefully studied and relied heavily upon the major findings and conclusions from the recent assessments of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 74 FR 66496, December 15, 2009. As summarized in the Technical Support Document for EPA's Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, anthropogenic emissions of GHGs are very likely (a 90 to 99 percent probability) the cause of most of the observed global warming over the last 50 years. [10] Primary GHGs of concern are carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6). Mobile sources emitted 31 percent of all U.S. GHGs in 2007 (transportation sources, which do not include certain off-highway sources, account for 28 percent) and have been the fastest-growing source of U.S. GHGs since 1990. [11] Mobile sources addressed in EPA's endangerment and contribution findings under CAA section 202(a)\u2014light-duty vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, buses, and motorcycles\u2014accounted for 23 percent of all U.S. GHG emissions in 2007. [12] Heavy-duty vehicles emit CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O, and HFCs and are responsible for nearly 19 percent of all mobile source GHGs (nearly 6 percent of all U.S. GHGs) and about 25 percent of section 202(a) mobile source GHGs. For heavy-duty vehicles in 2007, CO 2 emissions represented more than 99 percent of all GHG emissions (including HFCs). [13], 453334=In light of the above comments, the agencies re-evaluated the technical basis for the heavy-duty engine standards. The baseline HHD diesel engine performance in 2010 model year on the SET is estimated at 490 g CO 2/bhp-hr (4.81 gal/100 bhp-hr), based on our analysis of confidential data provided by manufacturers and data submitted for the non-GHG emissions certification process. Similarly, the baseline MHD diesel engine performance on the SET cycle is estimated to be 518 g CO 2/bhp-hr (5.09 gallon/100-bhp-hr) for the 2010 model year. Further discussion of the derivation of the baseline can be found in Section III. The agencies believe that the MY 2014 standards can be achieved by most manufacturers through the use of technologies time frame such as improved aftertreatment systems, friction reduction, improved auxiliaries, turbochargers, pistons, and other components. These standards will require diesel engine manufacturers to achieve on average a three percent reduction in fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions over the baseline 2010 model year levels., 855507=EPA continues to believe that it is appropriate to provide additional flexibility to manufacturers to meet the N 2 O and CH 4 standards. EPA is thus finalizing provisions allowing manufacturers to use CO 2 credits, on a CO 2-equivalent basis, to meet the N 2 O and CH 4 standards, which is consistent with many commenters' preferred approach. Manufacturers will have the option of using CO 2 credits to meet N 2 O and CH 4 standards on a test group basis as needed for MYs 2012-2016. Because fuel conversion manufacturers certifying under 40 CFR part 85, subpart F do not participate in ABT programs, EPA is finalizing a compliance option for fuel conversion manufacturers to comply with the N 2 O and CH 4 standards similar to the credit option just described above. The compliance option will allow conversion manufacturers, on an individual test group basis, to convert CO 2 overcompliance into CO 2 equivalents of N 2 O and/or CH 4 that can be subtracted from the CH 4 and N 2 O measured values to demonstrate compliance with CH 4 and/or N 2 O standards., 367377=Robert Bosch LLC (Bosch) commented that the absence of an expiration date for the standards proposed in the NPRM could violate 49 U.S.C. 32902, which it interpreted as requiring the MD/HD program to have standards that expire in five years. Section 32902(k)(3), which lays out the requirements for the MD/HD program, specifies the minimum regulatory lead and stability times, as described above, but does not specify a maximum duration period. In contrast, Section 32902(b)(3)(B) lays out the minimum and maximum durations of standards to be established in a rulemaking for the light-duty program, but prescribes no minimum lead or stability time. Bosch argued that as 49 U.S.C. Section 32902(k)(3) does not require a maximum duration period, Congress intended that NHTSA take the maximum duration period specified for the light-duty program in Section 32902(b)(3)(B), five years, and apply it to Section 32902(k)(3). Bosch also argued, however, that the minimum duration period should not be carried over from the light-duty to the heavy-duty section, as a minimum duration period for HD was specified in Section 32902(k)(3)., 212034=With the passage of the EISA in December 2007, Congress laid out a framework developing the first fuel efficiency regulations for HD vehicles. As codified at 49 U.S.C. 32902(k), EISA requires NHTSA to develop a regulatory system for the fuel efficiency of commercial medium-duty and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work trucks in three steps: a study by NAS, a study by NHTSA, [18] and a rulemaking to develop the regulations themselves., 875625=Current EPA emissions control regulations explicitly apply to heavy-duty engines and vehicles fueled by gasoline, methanol, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. For multi-fueled vehicles they call for compliance with requirements established for each consumed fuel. This contrasts with EPA's light-duty vehicle regulations that apply to all vehicles generally, regardless of fuel type. As we proposed, we are revising the heavy-duty vehicle and engine regulations to make them consistent with the light-duty vehicle approach, applying standards for all regulated criteria pollutants and GHGs regardless of fuel type, including application to all-electric vehicles (EVs). This provision will take effect in the 2014 model year, and be optional for manufacturers in earlier model years. However, to satisfy the CAA section 202(a)(3) lead time constraints, the provision will remain optional for all criteria pollutants through the 2015 model year. Commenters did not oppose this change in EPA regulations., 464634=In order to provide additional flexibility for manufacturers looking to align their technology changes with multiple regulatory requirements, the agencies are finalizing an alternate \u201cOBD phase-in\u201d option for meeting the standards for MHD and HHD diesel engines installed in tractors (in addition to engines installed in vocational vehicles as noted below in Section II.D), which delivers equivalent CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption reductions as the primary standards for the engines built in the 2013 through 2017 model years, as shown in Table II-4. The optional OBD phase-in schedule requires that engines built in the 2013 and 2016 model years to achieve greater reductions than the engines built in those model years under the primary program, but requires fewer reductions for the engines built in the 2014 and 2015 model years., 468407=The technologies for the 2013 model year optional standard include a subset of technologies that could be used to meet the primary 2014 model year standard. The agencies believe this approach is appropriate because the shorter lead time provided for manufacturers selecting this option limits the technologies which can be applied. However, in order to maintain equivalent CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption reduction over the 2013 through 2017 model year period, it is necessary for the 2016 model year standard to be equal to the 2017 model year standard, using the same technology paths described for the primary engine program. If a manufacturer selects this optional phase-in, then the engines must be certified starting in the 2013 model year and continue using this phase-in through 2016 model year. That is, once electing this compliance path, manufacturers must adhere to it. [68] Manufacturers may opt into the optional OBD phase-in through the voluntary NHTSA program, but must opt in in the 2013 model year and continue using this phase-in through the 2016 model year. Manufacturers that opt in to the voluntary NHTSA program in 2014 and 2015 will be required to meet the primary phase-in schedule and may not adopt the OBD phase-in option. Table II-5 below presents the final HD diesel engine CO 2 emission standards under the \u201cOBD phase-in\u201d option., 163553=NHTSA: Lily Smith, Office of Chief Counsel, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. Telephone: (202) 366-2992.

The standards will require a 3 percent reduction in engine fuel consumption and GHG emissions in 2014 MY based on improvements to engine components and aftertreatment systems. The 2017 MY standards will require a 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption and GHG emissions over a 2010 model year baseline and assumes the introduction, for some engines, of technologies such as turbocompounding. The standards, however, are not premised on the introduction of technologies that are still in development\u2014such as Rankine bottoming cycle\u2014since these approaches cannot be introduced without further technical development or engine re-design. [66], 245587=Thus, the agencies have created nine subcategories within the Class 7 and 8 combination tractor category based on the differences in expected emissions and fuel consumption associated with the key attributes of GVWR, cab type, and roof height. The agencies are setting standards beginning in 2014 model year with more stringent standards following in 2017 model year. Table I-3 presents the agencies' respective standards for combination tractor manufacturers for the 2017 model year. The standards represent an overall fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions reduction up to 23 percent from the tractors and the engines installed in them when compared to a baseline 2010 model year tractor and engine without idle shutdown technology. The standard values shown below differ somewhat from the proposal, reflecting refinements made to the GEM in response to comments. These changes did not impact our estimates of the relative effectiveness of the various control technologies modeled in this final action nor the overall cost or benefits or cost effectiveness estimated for these final vehicle standards., 890733=Neither EPCA nor EISA define \u201cmaximum feasible\u201d in the context of setting fuel efficiency or fuel economy standards. Instead, NHTSA is directed to consider and meet three factors when determining what the maximum feasible standards are\u2014\u201cappropriateness, cost-effectiveness, and technological feasibility.\u201d 32902(k)(2). These factors modify \u201cfeasible\u201d in the context of the MD/HD rules beyond a plain meaning of \u201ccapable of being done.\u201dSee Center for Biological Diversity v. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 538 F.3d 1172, 1194 (9th Cir. 2008). With respect to the setting of standards for light-duty vehicles, EPCA/EISA \u201cgives NHTSA discretion to decide how to balance the statutory factors\u2014as long as NHTSA's balancing does not undermine the fundamental purpose of EPCA: energy conservation.\u201dId. at 1195. Where Congress has not directly spoken to a potential issue related to such a balancing, NHTSA's interpretation must be a \u201creasonable accommodation of conflicting policies * * * committed to the agency's care by the statute.\u201dId. (discussing consideration of consumer demand) (internal citations omitted). In the context of the agency's light-duty vehicle authority, it was determined that Congress delegated the process for setting the maximum feasible standard to NHTSA with broad guidelines concerning the factors that the agency must consider. Id. (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in original). We believe that the same conclusion should be drawn about the statutory provisions governing the agency's setting of standards for heavy-duty vehicles. Those provisions prescribe statutory factors commensurate to, and equally broad as, those prescribed for light-duty. Thus, NHTSA believes that it is firmly within our discretion to weigh and balance the factors laid out in 32902(k) in a way that is technology-forcing, as evidenced by these standards promulgated in this final action, but not in a way that requires the application of technology which will not be available in the lead time provided by the rules, or which is not cost-effective, or is cost-prohibitive, as CBD evidently deems mandated., 624878=Environmental groups and others commented that the proposed standards were not stringent enough, citing the heavy-duty vehicle NAS study finding that technologies such as hybridization are feasible. However, in the ambitious timeframe we are focusing on for these rules, targeting as it does technologies implementable in the HD pickup and van fleet starting in 2014 and phasing in with normal product redesign cycles through 2018, our assessment shows that the standards we are establishing are appropriate. More advanced technologies considered in the NAS report would be appropriate for consideration in future rulemaking activity. Additional conventional technologies identified by commenters as promising in light-duty applications and potentially useful for HD applications are discussed in RIA chapter 2., 744013=Heavy-duty gasoline engines are also used in vocational vehicle applications. The number of engines certified in the past for this segment of vehicles is very limited and has ranged between three and five engine models. [149] Unlike the heavy-duty diesel engines typical of this segment which are built for vocational vehicles, these gasoline engines are developed for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans primarily, but are also sold as loose engines to vocational vehicle manufacturers, for use in vocational vehicles such as some delivery trucks. Some fleets still prefer gasoline engines over diesel engines. In the past, this was the case since gasoline stations were more prevalent than stations that sold diesel fuel. Because they are developed for HD pickups and vans, the agencies evaluated these engines in parallel with the heavy-duty pickup truck and van standard development. As in the pickup truck and van segment, the agencies anticipated that the manufacturers will have only one engine re-design within the 2014-2018 model years under consideration within the proposal. The agencies therefore proposed fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions standards for gasoline engines for use in vocational vehicles, which represent a five percent reduction in CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption in the 2016 model year over the 2010 MY baseline through use of technologies such as coupled cam phasing, engine friction reduction, and stoichiometric gasoline direct injection., 691344=For vocational vehicles, the rolling resistance of each tire will be measured using the ISO 28850 test method for drive tires and steer tires planned for fitment to the vehicle being certified. Once the test CRR values are obtained, a manufacturer will input the CRR values for the drive and steer tires separately into the GEM where, for vocational vehicles, the vehicle load is distributed equally over the steer and drive tires. Once entered, the amount of GHG reduction attributed to tire rolling resistance will be incorporated into the overall vehicle compliance value. The following table provides the revised target CRR values for vocational vehicles for 2014 and 2017 model years that are used to determine the vehicle standards., 819719=The N 2 O standard level is approximately two times the average N 2 O level of current gasoline and diesel heavy-duty trucks that meet the NO X standards effective since 2008 model year. [176] Manufacturers typically use design targets for NO X emission levels at approximately 50 percent of the standard, to account for in-use emissions deterioration and normal testing and production variability, and we expect manufacturers to utilize a similar approach for N 2 O emission compliance. We are not adopting a more stringent standard for current gasoline and diesel vehicles because the stringent heavy-duty NO X standards already result in significant N 2 O control, and we do not expect current N 2 O levels to rise for these vehicles particularly with expected manufacturer compliance margins., 803728=EPA and NHTSA have also identified three engine manufacturing entities that appear to fit the SBA size criteria of a small business based on company information included in Hoover's. [171] Based on 2008 and 2009 model year engine certification data submitted to EPA for non-GHG emissions standards, the agencies estimate that these small entities comprise less than 0.1 percent of the total heavy-duty engine sales in the United States. The final exemption from the standards established under this rulemaking would have a negligible impact on the GHG emissions and fuel consumption reductions otherwise due to the standards., 301041=The agencies received several comments from natural gas vehicle (NGV) interests arguing for greater crediting of NGVs than the proposed approach would have provided. Clean Energy, Hayday Farms, Border Valley, AGA, Ryder, Encana, and a group of NGV interests commented that the NPRM ignored Congress' intent to incentivize the use of NGVs by not including the conversion factor that exists in the light-duty statutory language. The commenters argued that Congress' intent to incentivize NGVs is evident in the formula contained in 49 U.S.C. 32905, which deems a gallon equivalent of gaseous fuel to have a fuel content of 0.15 gallon of fuel. The commenters also argued that Congress implicitly intended NGVs to be incentivized in this rulemaking, as evidenced by the incentives in the light-duty statutory text. AGA and Hayday suggested that the agencies were not including the NGV incentive from light-duty because Congress did not explicitly include it in 49 U.S.C. 32902(k), and argued that this would contradict the agencies' inclusion of other incentives similar to the light-duty rule., 881376=As indicated above, EPA believes that allowing certification of new switch locomotive engines to nonroad engine standards will greatly reduce emissions from switch locomotives, and EPA does not believe the slight difference in CO standards should prevent this environmentally beneficial program. EPA is therefore adopting a corrective technical amendment in part 1033. The regulation is being amended at \u00a7 1033.625(a)(2) to add the following italicized text: \u201cThe engines were certified to PM, NO X, and hydrocarbon standards that are numerically lower than the applicable locomotive standards of this part.\u201d This change is a straightforward correction to restore the intended usability of the provision and is not expected to have adverse environmental impacts, as nonroad engines have CO emissions that are typically well below both the nonroad and locomotive emissions standards., 380153=NHTSA recognizes that Section 329 contains a detailed penalty scheme, for light-duty vehicle CAFE standards. However, Section 32902(k)(2) explicitly directs NHTSA to \u201cadopt and implement appropriate test methods, measurement metrics, fuel economy standards, and compliance and enforcement protocols,\u201d in the creation of the new HD program. NHTSA continues to believe that this broad Congressional mandate should be interpreted based on a plain text reading, which includes the authority to determine compliance and enforcement protocols that will be effective and appropriate for this new sector of regulation. NHTSA also believes that reading Section 32912 to apply to the new HD program would contradict Congress' broad mandate for the agency to establish new measurement metrics and a compliance and enforcement program. Further, interpreting the requirement to create \u201cenforcement protocols\u201d for HD vehicles to mean that NHTSA should rely on the enforcement provisions for light-duty vehicles would go against the canon noted above that statutes should not be interpreted in a way that \u201crender[s] language superfluous.\u201dDobrova v. Holder, 607 F.3d 297, 302 (2d Cir. 2010), quoting Mendez v. Holder 566 F. 3d 316, 321-22 (2d Cir. 2009)., 987179=Idle reduction technologies provide significant reductions in fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions for Class 8 sleeper cabs and are available on the market today, and therefore will be available in the 2014 model year. There are several different technologies available to reduce idling. These include APUs, diesel fired heaters, and battery powered units. Our discussions with manufacturers indicate that idle technologies are sometimes installed in the factory, but it is also a common practice to have the units installed after the sale of the truck. We would like to continue to incentivize this practice and to do so in a manner that the emission reductions associated with idle reduction technology occur in use. Therefore, as proposed, we are allowing only idle emission reduction technologies with include an automatic engine shutoff (AES). We are also adopting some override provisions in response to comments we received (as explained below). As proposed, we are adopting a 100 percent application rate for this technology for Class 8 sleeper cabs, even though the current fleet is estimated to have a 30 percent application rate. The agencies are unaware of reasons why AES with extended idle reduction technologies could not be applied to all tractors with a sleeper cab, except those deemed a vocational tractor, in the available lead time., 736504=In order to ensure equivalent CO 2 and fuel consumption reductions and orderly compliance, and to avoid gaming, the agencies are requiring that if a manufacturer selects the OBD phase-in option, it must certify its engines starting in the 2013 model year and continue using this phase-in through the 2016 model year. Manufacturers may opt into the OBD phase-in option through the voluntary NHTSA program, but must opt in in the 2013 model year and continue using this phase-in through the 2016 model year. Manufacturers that opt in to the voluntary NHTSA program in 2014 and 2015 will be required to meet the primary phase-in schedule and may not adopt the OBD phase-in option., 425130=The first tractor characteristic to consider is payload which is determined by a tractor's GVWR and GCWR relative to the weight of the tractor, trailer, fuel, driver, and equipment. Class 7 trucks, which have a GVWR of 26,001-33,000 pounds and a typical GCWR of 65,000 pounds, have a lesser payload capacity than Class 8 trucks. Class 8 trucks have a GVWR of greater than 33,000 pounds and a typical GCWR of greater than 80,000 pounds, the effective weight limit on the federal highway system except in states with preexisting higher weight limits. Consistent with the recommendation in the National Academy of Sciences 2010 Report to NHTSA, [55] the agencies are finalizing a load-specific fuel consumption metric (g/ton-mile and gal/1,000 ton-mile) where the \u201cton\u201d represents the amount of payload. Generally, higher payload capacity vehicles have better specific fuel consumption and GHG emissions than lower payload capacity vehicles. Therefore, since the amount of payload that a Class 7 vehicle can carry is less than the Class 8 vehicle's payload capacity, the baseline fuel consumption and GHG emissions performance per ton-mile differs between the categories. It is consequently reasonable to distinguish between these two vehicle categories, so that the agencies are finalizing separate standards for Class 7 and Class 8 tractors., 473208=To account for this possibility, the agencies requested comment in the NPRM on the establishment of an optional alternative MHD and HHD engine standard for those engines installed in combination tractors which would be set at 3 percent below a manufacturer's 2011 engine baseline emissions and fuel consumption, or alternatively, at 2 percent below a manufacturer's 2011 baseline. The agencies also requested comment on extending this optional standard one year (to the 2017 MY) for a single engine family at a 6 percent level below the 2011 baseline. [69] This option would not be available unless and until a manufacturer had exhausted all available credits and credit opportunities, and engines under the optional standard could not generate credits., 202873=The agencies have analyzed in detail the projected costs, fuel savings, and benefits of the final GHG and fuel consumption standards. Table I-1 shows estimated lifetime discounted program costs (including technological outlays), fuel savings, and benefits for all heavy-duty vehicles projected to be sold in model years 2014-2018 over these vehicles' lives. Section I.D includes additional information about this analysis., 399400=NHTSA proposed to use the 49 CFR 571.3 definition of \u201ctruck tractor\u201d in 49 CFR 535.4 (see the proposed rule published November 30, 2010, 75 FR 74440) which stated that \u201ctruck tractor\u201d means a truck designed primarily for drawing other motor vehicles and not so constructed as to carry a load other than a part of the weight of the vehicle and the load so drawn., 898322=Though IPI agreed that the proposed rule was cost-benefit justified, IPI further stated that the agencies must implement an alternative that provides the maximum net benefits. The agencies believe that standards that maximized net benefits would be beyond the point of technological feasibility for this first phase of the HD National Program. The standards already require the maximum feasible fuel efficiency improvements for the HD fleet in the 2014-2018 time frame. Thus, even though, the final standards are highly cost-effective, and standards that maximized net benefits would likely be more stringent than those being promulgated in this final action, NHTSA believes that standards that maximized net benefits would not be appropriate or technologically feasible in the rulemaking time frame. The Executive Orders cited by IPI cannot and do not require an agency to select a regulatory alternative that is inconsistent with its statutory obligations. Thus, the standards adopted in the final rules are consistent with the agencies' respective statutory authorities, and are not established at levels which are infeasible or cost-ineffective.}",
