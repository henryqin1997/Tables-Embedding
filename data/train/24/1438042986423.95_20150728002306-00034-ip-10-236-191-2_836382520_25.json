We have an agreement with TESCO for its provision of services to us in connection with our drilling and completion operations. This agreement continues until canceled by either us or TESCO on 30\u00a0days advance written notice. Pursuant to this agreement, we are obligated to pay TESCO only for services actually performed or equipment delivered, as the case may be. This agreement does not require us to make any other payments to TESCO. Mr.\u00a0Quintana does not have any direct or indirect interest in the transaction, other than as a result of serving as an executive officer and director of TESCO. Prior to 2010, the services provided by TESCO and the amounts we paid did not exceed the threshold amount for review under our Related Person Policy. In 2010, we paid TESCO $346,683 for any services rendered. In 2011, we paid TESCO $1,029,665 for services rendered. As of March\u00a031, 2012, we had paid TESCO $172,495 for services rendered during 2012. In accordance with our Related Persons Transaction Policy, based upon these amounts, the Audit Committee reviewed the relationship between us and TESCO and determined that the relationship is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders., 458352=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This section describes the compensation programs for our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and each of our three other most highly compensated executive officers employed at the end of the 2011 fiscal year, who we collectively refer to in this \"Executive Compensation\" section as our \"NEOs\" or \"Named Executive Officers.\" Our NEOs for fiscal 2011 are:, 568587=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The LTIP, which we implemented in the current form in 2008, is an equity compensation program that utilizes performance share units, or PSUs, and restricted stock units, or RSUs, to reward our executive officers and key employees for long-term growth in our net asset value, as reflected in our absolute and relative cumulative total stockholder return, which includes the effects of dividends (\"TSR\"). Our employees at the senior professional level and above are eligible to participate in the LTIP. Awards of PSUs and RSUs are issued pursuant to our stockholder-approved Equity Plan., 495035=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This peer group includes fourteen of the companies included in our 2010 peer group, plus three additional companies: Comstock Resources,\u00a0Inc., Range Resources Corporation, and Stone Energy Corporation.

Our annual charitable gifts budget, which includes this matching program, is determined prior to the commencement of each year as a percentage of the average of the prior three years' total income, before taxes and charitable contributions, and all annually budgeted funds are expended for charitable purposes. Ms.\u00a0Baumann, Mr.\u00a0Seidl, and Mr.\u00a0Sullivan participated in this program during 2011, and we matched a total of $19,200 in non-employee director contributions for 2011 under this program.

The complex nature of the NPP and the delay and uncertainty in realization of compensation value until pool payout was reached made the NPP less attractive to newly recruited and highly marketable executives and employees. Accordingly, we discontinued the NPP in 2007 on a prospective basis, and the 2007 pool was the last NPP pool created. We will continue to make payments under the NPP for pool years established prior to 2008 for as long as a subject pool remains in payout status., 1043340=Using a black ink pen, mark your votes with an X as shown in this example.

To facilitate the delivery of these services to the Compensation Committee, F. W. Cook interfaces with our management, in particular the Vice President\u0097Human Resources. F. W. Cook does not provide directly, or indirectly through affiliates, any non-executive compensation services, such as pension consulting or human resource outsourcing, to us or any other clients. The total consulting fees we pay to F. W. Cook are less than 1% of the total annual revenues of F. W. Cook, and F. W. Cook consultants working with us are prohibited from owning any of our shares of common stock directly, although such shares may be owned within mutual funds. In addition, no officer, director, stockholder or employee of F. W. Cook has any known personal relationship with any of our officers, directors, stockholders or employees that would present a potential conflict to their independence. F. W. Cook has agreed to advise the Compensation Committee if any potential conflict of interest arises that could cause F. W. Cook's independence to be questioned and not to undertake any project for our management, except at the request of the Compensation Committee and as agent for the Compensation Committee. In 2011, F. W. Cook did not provide any services to us other than those requested by the Compensation Committee and related to F. W. Cook's engagement as the independent consultant to the Compensation Committee., 405523=Baltimore, MD 21202, 569831=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under our LTIP, participants were each awarded a target number of share units during the third quarter of 2011, for the performance measurement period beginning July\u00a01, 2011, and ending June\u00a030, 2014. Under the Equity Plan, 75% of the share units were granted as PSUs and 25% were granted as RSUs. RSUs are settled in common shares at the time of vesting, and PSUs are settled in common shares, depending on the extent to which we have satisfied the performance criteria, at the end of the three-year performance period. The actual number of shares of our common stock issued to settle PSUs at the end of the three-year performance period can range from 0% to 200% of the number of PSUs, depending on our absolute and relative TSR. TSR is measured on a compound annualized basis, and relative TSR is compared to the TSR of an equal weighted index of peer companies (the \"TSR Peer Group\"). The TSR Peer Group was constructed using the constituents of the Oil\u00a0& Gas Exploration and Production Global Industry Classification System Sub-Industry Group in the S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P MidCap 400 Indices, excluding our company. For the 2011-2014 performance period, the index constituents of the TSR Peer Group as of December\u00a031, 2011, include: Bill Barrett Corporation, Petroquest Energy\u00a0Inc., Petroleum Development Corporation, Cimarex Energy Company, Comstock Resources,\u00a0Inc., Contango Oil\u00a0& Gas Company, Forest Oil Corporation, Gulfport Energy Corporation, Penn Virginia Corporation, Plains Exploration\u00a0& Production Company, Quicksilver Resources\u00a0Inc., Swift Energy Company, GeoResources,\u00a0Inc., Northern Oil and Gas,\u00a0Inc., Energen Corporation, Approach Resources,\u00a0Inc., and Stone Energy Corporation. This TSR Peer Group is a custom index developed by Standard\u00a0& Poor's Financial Services\u00a0LLC for our company. The peer group participants may change, and change is independent of any action by us., 495492=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In May 2011, F.W. Cook conducted an analysis of competitive pay levels for the executive officers named in the most recently filed proxy statements of the peer group companies versus corresponding positions at our company. Competitive data generally reflected actual amounts paid for 2010 performance, although some information was available on 2011 target compensation levels. Findings from this analysis indicated that base salaries for our NEOs generally approximated the median of the peer group. Target annual cash compensation (base salary plus target annual bonus) was near the 25th\u00a0percentile for Messrs.\u00a0Best, Ottoson, and Pursell, and between the 25th\u00a0percentile and median for other named executives. Target total direct compensation (base salary, plus target bonus, plus long-term incentive compensation) was near the 25th\u00a0percentile for Mr.\u00a0Best and approximated the peer group median for the other NEOs. This analysis excluded amounts paid in connection with our NPP because those amounts are earned compensation from prior years' grants., 1033728=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the requirements of Rule\u00a014a-8, and as more specifically provided for in our By-Laws, in order for a nomination of persons for election to the Board or a proposal of business to be properly brought before the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, it must be either specified in the notice of the meeting given by our Corporate Secretary or otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board or by a stockholder entitled to vote and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in our By-Laws. A stockholder making a nomination for election to the Board or a proposal of business for the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must deliver proper notice to our Corporate Secretary not earlier than the close of business on the 105th\u00a0day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the 2012 Annual Meeting nor later than the close of business on the 75th\u00a0day prior to the first anniversary of the 2012 Annual Meeting. In other words, for a stockholder nomination for election to the Board or a proposal of business to be considered at the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, it should be properly submitted to our Corporate Secretary no earlier than February\u00a07, 2013 and no later than March\u00a09, 2013. If the date of our 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders changes by more than 20\u00a0days before or after May\u00a025, 2012, then stockholder nominations and proposals must be received not earlier than the close of business on the 105th\u00a0day prior to the date of the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and not later than the close of business on the later of the 75th\u00a0day prior to the date of the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or, if the first public announcement of the date of the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is less than 85\u00a0days prior to the date of the meeting, the 10th\u00a0day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is first made by us. For additional information about stockholder nominations and proposals, see \"Corporate Governance\u0097Director Nomination Process.\", 617617=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr.\u00a0Best received upon the commencement of his employment in June 2006 an award of 20,000 shares of restricted stock, a $50,000 cash bonus, and the opportunity to earn 20,000 RSUs over the next four years. Of the 20,000 RSUs, 5,000 RSUs vested in four equal annual installments beginning the first quarter of 2007, based on continued employment; 10,000 RSUs vested in four equal annual installments if annual net asset value growth exceeded 10%, and 5,000 RSUs vested in four equal annual installments if annual net asset value growth exceeded 15%. Mr.\u00a0Best earned 1,250 RSUs in each of March 2007, February 2008, February 2009, and February 2010 associated with the service component of the award. Under the performance element of the award, Mr.\u00a0Best earned 2,500 RSUs based on the results for 2007, but he did not earn any RSUs based on the results for 2006, 2008, and 2009, as our net asset value growth did not exceed 10%., 548973=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Production Volume\u0097The production volume target represents the volume of oil and gas estimated by our 2011 business plan to be produced and sold during 2011. This measure is important because proceeds from the sale of production volumes generate essentially all of our revenue. In 2011, our production volume exceeded the target by 17% and all five of our regions also exceeded their production targets for the year., 315596=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you receive a single set of proxy materials as a result of householding and you would like to receive a separate copy of our Notice of Internet Availability, 2011 Annual Report or Proxy Statement, please submit a request to our Corporate Secretary at 1775 Sherman Street, Suite\u00a01200, Denver, Colorado 80203 or call (303)\u00a0861-8140, and we will promptly send you what you have requested. You can also contact our Corporate Secretary at the address and phone number above if you receive multiple copies of our proxy materials and you would prefer to receive a single copy in the future, or if you would like to opt out of householding for future mailings. Beneficial owners can request information about householding from their bank, broker, or other nominee., 532716=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order for the STIP bonus pool to be funded for executive officers, the 2011 STIP required that our 2011 cash flow, as described below, exceed a threshold level of $350\u00a0million. If our cash flow had not exceeded the threshold level, no STIP bonus would be paid regardless of the results of any other metric. Our actual cash flow was $865\u00a0million, resulting in full initial funding of the STIP bonus pool for executive officers. The Compensation Committee then examined our performance under five quantitative and two qualitative metrics to determine actual bonus payments to executive officers by reducing (but not increasing) the amounts funded through achievement of the cash flow threshold. Using this construct, bonus payments to our executive officers under the STIP are intended to be \"performance-based,\" as defined under Section\u00a0162(m) of the IRC, and therefore fully deductible for federal income tax purposes. The Compensation Committee evaluated our performance in the, 837398=2011 Option Exercises and Stock Vested, 435549=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We began granting PSUs under the Equity Plan to eligible officers and key employees on August\u00a01, 2008., 387584=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table shows beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock as known by us as of March\u00a015, 2012, by all beneficial owners of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of March\u00a015, 2012, by each director, director nominee, and named executive officer, and all directors and executive officers as a group. Restricted stock units and performance share units are not included in this table as no actual shares have been issued with respect to our outstanding restricted stock units and performance share units. A supplemental table has been included later in this section describing the number of restricted stock units and performance share units owned by the individuals described below., 524096=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The STIP is designed to reward executives for their achievement of our annual business plan measured by certain performance objectives. These performance objectives are reviewed each year by management and the Compensation Committee, and after the approval of these objectives, are published as annual goals. These goals may be adjusted from time to time during the year due to significant changes in our business in the discretion of the Compensation Committee. For example, due to the transition in 2011 from reporting our production on a two-stream basis (oil and gas) to reporting our production on a three-stream basis (oil, gas and natural gas liquids), the Compensation Committee adjusted the goals for production volume, proved developed reserves and finding and development costs. Payments under the STIP are in the form of annual cash bonuses under our Cash Bonus Plan, which was approved by our stockholders in May 2008., 239140=April\u00a013, 2012, 550661=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cash Flow\u0097Our cash flow target is calculated based on our GAAP net income, as adjusted for miscellaneous gains and losses; depreciation, depletion and amortization; impairment and abandonment expense; exploration expense; deferred taxes; change in NPP liability; stock compensation expense; non-cash interest expense and unrealized derivative losses. This measure is important because our cash flow is the primary source of funding for our ongoing capital program and working capital needs, as well as a key factor in shareholder value creation. In 2011, our cash flow exceeded the 2011 business plan target by 29% due to higher than projected production volumes and lower than projected operating costs., 1003624=PROPOSAL 2\u0097RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF DELOITTE\u00a0& TOUCHE\u00a0LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2012, 286247=2011 Annual Report, 462218=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2011, our strong financial and operational performance significantly advanced our goal of long-term stockholder value creation. We exceeded our STIP annual targets with respect to four out of five quantitative metrics:, 1037824=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We filed our Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for the fiscal year ended December\u00a031, 2011, with the SEC.

The NCG Committee performed its evaluation and nominating functions during 2011 and early 2012. The NCG Committee selects a nominee based on the nominee's skills, achievements, and experience. As set forth in the director qualification standards included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and reflected in the discussion below, the Board as a whole should have broad and relevant experience in high-level business policymaking and a commitment to represent the long-term interests of our stockholders. These standards also provide that each director should have experience in positions of responsibility and leadership, an understanding of our business environment, and a reputation for integrity. In addition, the Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a director who retires or experiences a significant change in his or her professional or business responsibilities, including a change in his or her principal occupation, position or business affiliation, should, if requested by the NCG Committee, be prepared to offer his or her resignation from the Board. Upon tender of a resignation, the NCG Committee and the Board may review the continued appropriateness of Board membership under the circumstances., 925012=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Sullivan was paid a retainer for his service as non-executive Chairman of the Board of $75,000 for the 2011-2012 annual service period.

We implemented the LTIP in its current form in 2008, and pursuant to that program we now grant PSUs and RSUs., 314315=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called \"householding.\" Under this procedure, stockholders of record who have the same address and last name will receive only one copy of our Notice of Internet Availability, 2011 Annual Report, and Proxy Statement until such time as one or, 482473=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2011, the Compensation Committee met nine times to review and administer the matters noted above and other related matters., 433691=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We began issuing RSUs on June\u00a030, 2004, to eligible officers and key employees following the approval of our Restricted Stock Plan by our stockholders. Grants of RSUs were made annually under the Restricted Stock Plan in 2004 and 2005. In 2006 and 2007, RSU grants were made under our stockholder approved Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (the \"Equity Plan\"), subject to our performance criteria. These grants were made in the first quarter immediately following each year-end. In June 2008, we issued certain transitional RSUs in connection with the cessation of the Net Profits Interest Bonus Plan (\"NPP\"), and on August\u00a01, 2009, as part of our Long Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\") under the Equity Plan, we issued a percentage of that year's awards as RSUs. In both 2010 and 2011, we also issued RSUs as part of our LTIP awards. Neither the transitional RSUs nor the LTIP RSU awards were subject to performance criteria. We have also issued RSUs to Mr.\u00a0Best under the terms of his employment contract., 290046=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Proxy Statement contains information about the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"Annual Meeting\") of SM Energy Company to be held in the J.D. Hershner Room of Wells Fargo Bank located at 1700 Lincoln Street, Denver, Colorado, on Wednesday, May\u00a023, 2012, at 3:30\u00a0p.m. local time. Our Board of Directors (\"Board\") is using this Proxy Statement to solicit proxies for use at the Annual Meeting. In this Proxy Statement, the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" refer to SM Energy Company, inclusive of its subsidiaries., 330789=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table identifies the members of each committee, as of December\u00a031, 2011, and sets forth the number of meetings held in 2011:, 329609=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Board has an Audit Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a Compensation Committee, and an Executive Committee. Our Board and each of its committees, other than our Executive Committee, which did not meet during 2011, separately evaluated their respective, 285428=Stockholder Proposals for the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 323549=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since February 2007, our Board's leadership structure has separated the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Mr.\u00a0Sullivan, an independent director with over eight years' experience serving on the Board, experience serving on several other public company boards, and over 30\u00a0years of experience working with oil and gas exploration and production companies, including as an executive officer, serves as our Chairman of the Board, and Anthony J. Best serves as our Chief Executive Officer., 486313=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each year, the Compensation Committee performs a compensation risk assessment. In 2010 and again in 2011, the Compensation Committee has determined that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. The Compensation Committee conducts an annual review and evaluation of our compensation policies and practices for all employees to determine whether and to what extent, if any, our policies and practices of compensating our employees could result in risk taking incentives, and whether risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. In its most recent review and evaluation, the Compensation Committee considered a compensation risk assessment performed by F.W. Cook, in addition to its annual review of our compensation policies and practices. F.W. Cook and the Compensation Committee determined that our compensation policies and practices do not encourage behaviors that would create a material risk to us., 962272=5/21/2009, 489903=peer companies include standard measures such as revenues, assets, number of employees, and enterprise value, as well as several industry-specific criteria such as annual production volume, fiscal year-end reserves, total costs incurred in oil and gas activities, and the magnitude of each company's offshore and non-U.S.-based operations. Based upon these criteria, F. W. Cook, with input from the Compensation Committee, develops a peer group for us that includes the 15-20 companies that best fit the established selection criteria, without reviewing individual company salary data, and excludes companies from a peer group for a prior year that no longer satisfies one or more of F.W. Cook's selection criteria. The peer group used for 2011 compensation comparisons was approved in July 2010 and consisted of the following companies:, 316988=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Proxy Statement for the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and the 2011 Annual Report to Stockholders, which includes the Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for the fiscal year ended December\u00a031, 2011, are available at http://\u00a0www.proxyease.com/sm-energy/2012, 1039438=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Management does not know of any matters other than the election of directors, the ratification of the appointment by the Audit Committee of Deloitte\u00a0& Touche\u00a0LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2012 and the advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers to be brought before the Annual Meeting. If any other matters not mentioned in this Proxy Statement are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, the individuals named in the enclosed proxy intend to use their discretionary voting authority under the proxy to vote the proxy in accordance with their best judgment on those matters., 573376=2011 PAYOUT MATRIX, 551482=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net Income\u0097The GAAP net income target represents the amount of GAAP net income initially expected to be generated based on achieving projected 2011 business plan results. Net income is the end result of adjusting the operating cash flow of our company for all non-cash costs and non-recurring events. This measure is important because the rate at which non-cash costs are incurred is related to investment efficiency over time, and non-recurring events can be materially positive or negative relative to expectations. In 2011, our net income was less than our target by approximately 7%, primarily due to impairments driven by end-of-year gas prices, which broadly affected our industry., 1032861=STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2013 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS, 607628=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The total number of PSUs and RSUs awarded and individual allocations to participants were approved by the Compensation Committee during the third quarter of 2011. A total of 356,947 PSUs and RSUs were granted to 367 employees during the third quarter of 2011. In its determination of the total pool value for 2011, the Compensation Committee considered various factors including historical fair value transfer (\"FVT,\" or the percentage of market capitalization transferred to employees annually, 617272=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Best is the only executive that has a written employment agreement.

In accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), we are furnishing our proxy materials to many beneficial owners of our stock via the Internet. A Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the \"Notice\") will be mailed by intermediaries on or about April\u00a013, 2012, to beneficial owners of our stock. Stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on a website referred to in the Notice or request that we send them a printed set of the proxy materials by following the instructions in the Notice. The Notice will also provide instructions on how to vote your shares. The proxy materials are being mailed to all stockholders of record on or about April\u00a013, 2012., 377389=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted above, the NCG Committee will consider stockholder recommendations for candidates for the Board. All stockholder recommendations must comply with the notice requirements contained in Section\u00a04(g) of our By-Laws, which requires, among other things, detailed information concerning the stockholder making the proposal (and the beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal is made, if any), the name and address of the stockholder and specific information concerning such stockholder's interests in our securities. In addition, the notice must include the recommended candidate's name, biographical data, qualifications, details regarding any material monetary agreements between the stockholder and the proposed nominee and a written questionnaire completed by the proposed nominee. We will furnish copies of our By-Laws to any person who requests them without charge. Requests for copies should be directed to our Corporate Secretary. For additional information about stockholder nominations, including nominations for the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, see \"Stockholder Proposals for the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\" No stockholder director nominations were received in connection with the Annual Meeting., 330534=performance for 2011 and completed written evaluations. The performance evaluation process was directed by the NCG Committee and the evaluations were discussed and accepted by the Board., 631064=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to base salaries and cash bonuses, the following table reflects RSUs and PSUs granted in 2009, 2010, and 2011 to our NEOs. Eligible NEOs participate in our STIP and LTIP, as described more fully in the \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" section of this Proxy Statement., 511222=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Base salary is intended to provide a foundation of executive compensation that recognizes the level of responsibility and authority of each individual executive and compensates for the individual executive's day to day contributions to our success. Based on competitive market data, individual performance and potential, internal equity considerations, and input from the Chief Executive Officer (for executives other than himself), the Compensation Committee approved the following salary adjustments on March\u00a031, 2011, effective April\u00a03, 2011, for the NEOs:, 326139=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to having an independent Chairman of the Board, the Board has a separate lead independent director position, which is Mr.\u00a0Bickle, who assumed such role on January\u00a01, 2012, upon our Board's appointment of him as Chair of its NCG Committee. The lead independent director is responsible for presiding at executive sessions of non-management directors, which typically meet immediately before or after each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board or as deemed necessary. In the lead independent director's absence, the Chairman of the Board serves as lead independent director., 252124=Denver, Colorado April\u00a013, 2012, 630665=Summary Compensation Table for 2009, 2010, and 2011, 874183=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Qualified Pension Plan in combination with the SERP for certain executives provide a benefit after 25\u00a0years of credited service to us equal to 35% of final average compensation. Final average compensation is the average of the highest three consecutive years of the ten years preceding termination of employment. For each NEO, the level of compensation used to determine benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan and the SERP is that officer's average base salary, excluding bonuses. We provide these plans to remain competitive in the hiring and retention of qualified personnel, and to support our succession planning objectives with a goal of providing retirement replacement income. As of December\u00a031, 2011, no NEO was eligible for early retirement under the Qualified Pension Plan, and no NEO was eligible for early retirement (having reached the age of 55 and provided at least 10\u00a0years of service to us) under the SERP., 281244=Proposal 2\u0097Ratification of the Appointment of Deloitte\u00a0& Touche\u00a0LLP as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2012, 525144=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each STIP participant is assigned a target bonus as a percentage of base salary, based on the pay level that the Compensation Committee deems to be competitive and appropriate assuming all of our performance goals are achieved at the \"target\" level. Actual bonuses may range from 0 to 2 times the target level based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of our performance and that of each of our executive officers. Target bonuses for 2011 as percentages of base salary for the NEOs were the same as in 2010 and were as follows:, 549505=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proved Developed Reserve Additions\u0097The proved developed reserve additions target represents the proved developed reserves estimated to be added by our capital program during 2011. This measure is important because proved developed reserves are the primary source of future production and cash flow for us and, as such, relate directly to the value of our company. In 2011, we generated 48% more proved developed reserve additions than our target amount or year-to-year growth in our actual performance under this metric of 70%., 247348=NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD WEDNESDAY, MAY 23, 2012, 436305=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table shows the number of RSUs and PSUs owned by each of the directors, our named executive officers and all directors and executive officers as a group, as of March\u00a015, 2012. The PSUs listed below represent the right to receive, upon settlement of the PSUs after the completion of the three-year performance periods ending June\u00a030, 2012, June\u00a030, 2013, and June\u00a030, 2014, a number of shares of our common stock that may vary from zero to two times the number of PSUs indicated, which were granted on the respective award dates, depending on the extent to which we have achieved certain performance goals during a certain performance period and the extent to which the PSUs have vested., 553373=Our EHS performance, based on statistical industry measurements, improved in some aspects during 2011; however, we experienced some significant safety challenges in our operational activities where dramatic ramp-up in drilling and completion activity have strained the capabilities of our drilling and completion contractors. As a result, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion with respect to this qualitative measure in 2011 and reduced the cash bonuses for our NEOs that it would have otherwise approved on the basis of the other quantitative and qualitative measures., 927273=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table sets forth the annual and long-term compensation paid during 2011 to our non-employee directors. The stock based component of the compensation reflects the grant date fair value. Cash based compensation is recorded based on the payments to the individual director., 455996=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based solely on a review of reports furnished to us, and written representations from our officers and directors, all directors, executive officers, and 10% owners timely filed all reports regarding transactions in our securities required to be filed for 2011 under Section\u00a016(a) under the Exchange Act, except that Mr.\u00a0Pursell inadvertently failed to timely report one transaction involving a charitable gift of 267 shares of our common stock. A Form\u00a04 reporting Mr.\u00a0Pursell's gift was filed after the error was discovered., 466020=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our current LTIP uses a combination of service-vesting restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based share units (PSUs). We believe these types of long-term incentives appropriately balance risk and reward, because such units have both upside potential and downside risk. The performance measures used in our LTIP balance our absolute total stockholder return, as well as our total stockholder return relative to our peers, over the long-term. We have outstanding stock options, but we discontinued granting stock options to employees after December 2003 and to directors after December 2004. We believe that long-term incentive programs that overemphasize stock options could contribute to both risk-taking and a disproportionate focus on short-term share price increases, especially if stock options become \"underwater\" (i.e.,\u00a0the option exercise price is above the then current share price). Underwater options could arguably encourage executives to take risks in attempts to increase share price; in such cases, options have upside opportunity, but no downside risk., 615911=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The purpose of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") is to provide an opportunity for eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount to the market price. The plan cycle consists of two periods annually, with plan periods for the six months ending June\u00a030 and December\u00a031 of each year. The ESPP allows employees to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their base compensation. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning or ending of the period. The maximum amount an employee can purchase through the plan is $25,000 per year, pursuant to IRC restrictions. In December 2009, the Board amended the ESPP to limit the number of shares that an employee could purchase in a six-month period to 2,500 shares to comply with final Internal Revenue Service regulations that require a fixed cap for the number of shares that could be purchased during a plan period., 625621=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equity grants awarded as part of the LTIP and pursuant to the Equity Plan are made during the third quarter of each year. The Compensation Committee generally approves these grants at a meeting each July. The Compensation Committee has in the past, and may in the future, make limited grants of equity on other dates for newly hired executives as part of compensation packages designed to recruit such persons., 483264=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since 2007, the Compensation Committee has engaged F. W. Cook as its independent executive compensation consultant. F. W. Cook reports directly to the Compensation Committee and the Compensation Committee may replace F. W. Cook or hire additional consultants or other advisors as it deems necessary. A principal of F. W. Cook attends Compensation Committee meetings, as requested, and communicates with the Compensation Committee between meetings. The services F. W. Cook provides include advising the Compensation Committee on the design of our executive compensation programs and the evolving best practices related thereto, providing market information and analysis, 1033148=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to the various rules promulgated by the SEC, stockholders interested in submitting a proposal for inclusion in our proxy materials and for presentation at the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders may do so by following the procedures set forth in Rule\u00a014a-8 under the Exchange Act.
