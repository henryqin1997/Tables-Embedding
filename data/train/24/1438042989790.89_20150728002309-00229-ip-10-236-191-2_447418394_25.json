Turbine speed and fuel delivery are coordinated so as to provide a fuel/air mixture at an ignition device allowing a successful ignition. If a successful ignition has not occurred by end of the start sequence the gas turbine engine is purged and the start sequence is repeated after the purging of the gas turbine engine. 20100293960 Published Description Patent application number Richard Woods, Lincoln GB 01-01-2009 Segregator Barriers - A segregator barrier ( 20090001234 Published Description Patent application number Reginald J. Woods, Hampshire GB 07-08-2010 MANUFACTURE OF SONAR PROJECTORS - A method of manufacturing a sonar projector is disclosed. The method comprises the steps of: bonding a flat piezo-ceramic plate to a flexible conducting sheet; dicing the plate to form an assembly comprising a matrix of piezo-ceramic pegs bonded to the flexible conducting sheet, the pegs being separated by kerfs; bending the assembly to a predetermined curvature, thereby expanding the kerfs; filling the expanded kerfs with a filler material; and applying conductive material to the exposed surfaces of the pegs, such that the conductive material and the flexible conducting sheet in combination form electrodes operable to apply a voltage to the piezo-ceramic pegs.
