The surface is high in hardness and the center part is low in hardness, so the fatigue characteristics and shapeability are superior. Note that if annealing under conditions giving a tempering parameter \u03bb defined by \u03bb=T(20+log(t)) of 14000 to 19000 (where T is the absolute temperature, t is the time (h), and the temperature rise is 660\u00b0 C.), it is possible to relieve the internal stress and further improve the fatigue characteristics. 11-12-2009 20110121639 PRESS-FORMING METHOD OF TUBULAR PART HAVING CROSS SECTION OF IRREGULAR SHAPE, AND TUBULAR PART HAVING CROSS SECTION OF IRREGULAR SHAPE FORMED BY THE",
