    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{871561=\u201cAmericans continue to show lower levels of confidence in most of the major institutions central to U.S. society, with only the military and small business getting ratings in 2015 that are above their historical averages,\u201d the Gallup spokesman said. \u201cThat speaks to the broader dissatisfaction Americans have with the state of the nation more generally over the past decade as the U.S. has faced serious economic, international and political challenges. Americans have tended to be more confident in U.S. institutions when the economy has been strong, such as in the mid-1980s and the late 1990s and early 2000s. Although Americans are now more upbeat about the economy than they were in 2008-2013, they are not yet convinced that the economy is good, given that their assessments\u00a0of national economic conditions remain more negative than positive.\u201d, 157315=Conrad completed his last long-distance voyage as a seaman on 26 July 1893 when the Torrens docked at London and \u201cJ. Conrad Korzemowin\u201d (per the certificate of discharge) debarked. When the Torrens had left Adelaide on 13 March 1893, the passengers had included two young Englishmen returning from Australia and New Zealand: 25-year-old lawyer and future novelist John Galsworthy; and Edward Lancelot Sanderson, who was going to help his father run a boys\u2019 preparatory school at Elstree. They were probably the first Englishmen and non-sailors with whom Conrad struck up a friendship; he would remain in touch with both. The protagonist of one of Galsworthy\u2019s first literary attempts, \u201cThe Doldrums\u201d (1895\u201396), the first mate Armand, is obviously modeled on Conrad. At Cape Town, where the Torrens remained from 17 to 19 May, Galsworthy left the ship to look at the local mines. Sanderson continued his voyage and seems to have been the first to develop closer ties with Conrad.[2]:182\u20133, 495037=A third difficult question is whether the Treaty Clause implies a Senate power or role in treaty termination. Scholarly opinion is divided, and few Framers appear to have discussed the question directly. One view sees the power to make a treaty as distinct from the power of termination, with the latter being more akin to a power of implementation. Since the Constitution does not directly address the termination power, this view would give it to the President as part of the President\u2019s executive powers to conduct foreign affairs and to execute the laws. When the termination question first arose in 1793, Washington and his Cabinet, which included Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson, embraced this view. All of them thought Washington could, on his own authority, terminate the treaty with France if necessary to keep the United States neutral., 335280=Although after the election of 2008 most Republican office holders argued against the Troubled Asset Relief Program, against the subsequent bailouts of the auto industry, against the several \u201cstimulus\u201d bills and further summary expansions of government power to benefit clients of government at the expense of ordinary citizens, the American people had every reason to believe that many Republican politicians were doing so simply by the logic of partisan opposition. After all, Republicans had been happy enough to approve of similar things under Republican administrations. Differences between Bushes, Clintons, and Obamas are of degree, not kind. Moreover, 2009-10 establishment Republicans sought only to modify the government\u2019s agenda while showing eagerness to join the Democrats in new grand schemes, if only they were allowed to. Sen. Orrin Hatch continued dreaming of being Ted Kennedy, while Lindsey Graham set aside what is true or false about \u201cglobal warming\u201d for the sake of getting on the right side of history. No prominent Republican challenged the ruling class\u2019s continued claim of superior insight, nor its denigration of the American people as irritable children who must learn their place. The Republican Party did not disparage the ruling class, because most of its officials are or would like to be part of it., 949707=As indicated in Chart 2, countries moving up the economic freedom scale show increasingly high levels of average income. Economies rated \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cmostly free\u201d in the 2015 Index enjoy incomes that are over twice the average levels in all other countries and more than five times higher than the incomes of \u201crepressed\u201d economies., 633719=By 1960, the Federation\u2019s grassroots volunteers had provided family planning counseling in hundreds of communities across the country.[13] Planned Parenthood was one of the founding members of the International Planned Parenthood Federation when it was launched at a conference in Bombay, India in 1952.[13][14], 147363=Conrad was a Russian subject, having been born in the Russian part of what had once been the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. In December 1867, with the Russian government\u2019s permission, his father Apollo had taken him to the Austrian part of the former Commonwealth, which enjoyed considerable internal freedom and a degree of self-government. After the father\u2019s death, Conrad\u2019s uncle Bobrowski had attempted to secure Austrian citizenship for him \u2013 to no avail, probably because Conrad had not received permission from Russian authorities to remain abroad permanently and had not been released from being a Russian subject. Conrad could not return to Ukraine, in the Russian Empire\u00a0\u2013 he would have been liable to many years\u2019 military service and, as the son of political exiles, to harassment.[2]:41, 253548=Conrad always retained a strong emotional attachment to his native language. He asked his visiting Polish niece Karola Zag\u00f3rska, \u201cWill you forgive me that my sons don\u2019t speak Polish?\u201d[2]:481 In June 1924, shortly before his death, he apparently expressed a desire that his son John marry a Polish girl and learn Polish, and toyed with the idea of returning for good to now independent Poland.[2]:571, 107785=Initially, the novel fared poorly in both the United Kingdom and the United States, selling only 3,076 copies between 1907 and 1914. The book fared slightly better in Britain, yet no more than 6,500 copies were pressed before 1914. Although sales increased after 1914, the novel never sold more than \u201cmodestly\u201d throughout Conrad\u2019s lifetime. The novel was released to favourable reviews, with most agreeing with the view of The Times Literary Supplement, that the novel \u201cincrease[d] Mr. Conrad\u2019s reputation, already of the highest.\u201d[21] However, there were detractors, who largely disagreed with the novel\u2019s \u201cunpleasant characters and subject\u201d. Country Life magazine called the story \u201cindecent\u201d, whilst also criticising Conrad\u2019s \u201coften dense and elliptical style\u201d.[21], 723459=In 1926, Sanger gave a lecture on birth control to the women\u2019s auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan in Silver Lake, New Jersey.[47] She described it as \u201cone of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing,\u201d and added that she had to use only \u201cthe most elementary terms, as though I were trying to make children understand.\u201d[47] Sanger\u2019s talk was well received by the group, and as a result, \u201ca dozen invitations to similar groups were proffered.\u201d[47], 944290=Since its inception in 1995, the Index of Economic Freedom has chronicled hundreds of examples of government policy changes that have enhanced economic freedom, thereby promoting human progress and greater prosperity. As the Index has catalogued, nations with higher degrees of economic freedom prosper because they capitalize more fully on the ability of the free-market system not only to generate, but also to reinforce dynamic growth through efficient resource allocation, value creation, and innovation. Policies that promote freedom, whether through improvements in the rule of law, the promotion of competition and openness, or suitable restraints on the size and economic reach of government, turn out in practice to offer and advance practical solutions to a wide range of economic and social challenges that face the world\u2019s societies., 263737=In San Francisco in 1979, a small triangular square at Columbus Avenue and Beach Street, near Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, was dedicated as \u201cJoseph Conrad Square\u201d after Conrad. The square\u2019s dedication was timed to coincide with release of Francis Ford Coppola\u2018s Heart of Darkness-inspired film, Apocalypse Now., 99135=Conrad\u2019s character, Stevie, is based on the French anarchist, Martial Bourdin, who died gruesomely in Greenwich Park when the explosives he carried prematurely detonated.[7] Bourdin\u2019s motives remain a mystery as does his intended target, which may have been the Greenwich Observatory.[8] In the 1920 Author\u2019s Note to the novel, Conrad recalls a discussion with Ford Madox Ford about the bombing:[9], 323445=Posted on July 28, 2015.

His actions were described as \u201ctroubling\u201d by the state Supreme Court, but ultimately Planned Parenthood was compelled to turn over the medical records, albeit with more stringent court-mandated privacy safeguards for the patients involved.[111] In 2007, Kline\u2019s successor, Paul J. Morrison, notified the clinic that no criminal charges would be filed after a three-year investigation, as \u201can objective, unbiased and thorough examination\u201d showed no wrongdoing. Morrison stated that he believed Kline had politicized the attorney general\u2019s office.[112] In 2012, a Kansas district attorney dropped all of the remaining criminal charges against the Kansas City-area Planned Parenthood clinic accused of performing illegal abortions, citing a lack of evidence of wrongdoing.[113] In all, the Planned Parenthood clinic had faced 107 criminal charges from Kline and other Kansas prosecutors, all of which were ultimately dropped for lack of evidence.[113], 875464=Regarding the latest poll numbers, the Gallup spokesman added, \u201cFrom a broad perspective, Americans\u2019 confidence in all institutions over the last two years has been the lowest since Gallup began systematic updates of a larger set of institutions in 1993.\u201d, 878744=http://www.wnd.com/2015/06/poll-americans-lose-confidence-in-everything/, 866596=By Kenneth T. WalshJune 17, 2015 | 7:20 a.m. EDT+ More, 405770=Suppose that the Country Party (whatever its name might be) were to capture Congress, the presidency, and most statehouses. What then would it do? Especially if its majority were slim, it would be tempted to follow the Democrats\u2019 plan of 2009-2010, namely to write its wish list of reforms into law regardless of the Constitution and enact them by partisan majorities supported by interest groups that gain from them, while continuing to vilify the other side. Whatever effect this might have, it surely would not be to make America safe for self-governance because by carrying out its own \u201crevolution from above\u201d to reverse the ruling class\u2019s previous \u201crevolution from above,\u201d it would have made that ruinous practice standard in America. Moreover, a revolution designed at party headquarters would be antithetical to the country class\u2019s diversity as well as to the American Founders\u2019 legacy., 283591=On 12 October 1912, American music critic James Huneker visited Conrad and later recalled being received by \u201ca man of the world, neither sailor nor novelist, just a simple-mannered gentleman, whose welcome was sincere, whose glance was veiled, at times far-away, whose ways were French, Polish, anything but \u2018literary,\u2019 bluff or English.\u201d[2]:437, 725895=During the 1920s, Sanger received hundreds of thousands of letters, many of them written in desperation by women begging for information on how to prevent unwanted pregnancies.[51][52] Five hundred of these letters were compiled into the 1928 book, Motherhood in Bondage.[53][54], 352920=The cultural divide between the \u201ceducated class\u201d and the rest of the country opened in the interwar years. Some Progressives joined the \u201cvanguard of the proletariat,\u201d the Communist Party. Many more were deeply sympathetic to Soviet Russia, as they were to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Not just the Nation, but also the New York Times and National Geographic found much to be imitated in these regimes because they promised energetically to transcend their peoples\u2019 ways and to build \u201cthe new man.\u201d Above all, our educated class was bitter about America. In 1925 the American Civil Liberties Union sponsored a legal challenge to a Tennessee law that required teaching the biblical account of creation. The ensuing trial, radio broadcast nationally, as well as the subsequent hit movie Inherit the Wind, were the occasion for what one might have called the Chautauqua class to drive home the point that Americans who believed in the Bible were willful ignoramuses. As World War II approached, some American Progressives supported the Soviet Union (and its ally, Nazi Germany) and others Great Britain and France. But Progressives agreed on one thing: the approaching war should be blamed on the majority of Americans, because they had refused to lead the League of Nations. Darryl Zanuck produced the critically acclaimed movie [Woodrow] Wilson featuring Cedric Hardwicke as Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, who allegedly brought on the war by appealing to American narrow-mindedness against Wilson\u2019s benevolent genius., 482611=In 1972, Congress passed legislation requiring the president to notify Congress of any executive agreements that are formed.[13], 417926=Posted on July 20, 2015.

Sanger was the organization\u2019s first president and served in that role until she was 80 years old.[61] In the early 1950s, Sanger encouraged philanthropist Katharine McCormick to provide funding for biologist Gregory Pincus to develop the birth control pill which was eventually sold under the name Enovid.[62], 1027398=The United States\u2019 economic freedom score is 76.2, making its economy the 12th freest in the 2015 Index. Its score is 0.7 point higher than last year, with modest gains in six of the 10 economic freedoms, including control of government spending, outweighing a slight decline in business freedom., 198807=Twelve years later, Conrad\u2019s wife Jessie died on 6 December 1936 and was interred with him., 184989=Conrad, who was noted by his Polish acquaintances to be fluent in his native tongue, participated in their impassioned political discussions. He declared presciently, as Pi\u0142sudski had earlier in 1914 in Paris, that in the war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter must in turn be beaten by France and Britain.[2]:464, 754633=From 1939 to 1942 Sanger was an honorary delegate of the Birth Control Federation of America, which included a supervisory role\u2014alongside Mary Lasker and Clarence Gamble\u2014in the Negro Project, an effort to deliver birth control to poor black people.[100] Sanger wanted the Negro Project to include black ministers in leadership roles, but other supervisors did not. To emphasize the benefits of involving black community leaders, she wrote to Gamble \u201cwe do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.\u201d This quote has been cited by Angela Davis to support her claims that Sanger wanted to exterminate black people.[101] However, New York University\u2019s Margaret Sanger Papers Project, argues that in writing that letter, \u201cSanger recognized that elements within the black community might mistakenly associate the Negro Project with racist sterilization campaigns in the Jim Crow South, unless clergy and other community leaders spread the word that the Project had a humanitarian aim.\u201d[102], 254373=In 1975 the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe published an essay, \u201cAn Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad\u2019s \u2018Heart of Darkness\u2019\u201c, which provoked controversy by calling Conrad a \u201cthoroughgoing racist\u201d. Achebe\u2019s view was that Heart of Darkness cannot be considered a great work of art because it is \u201ca novel which celebrates\u2026 dehumanisation, which depersonalises a portion of the human race.\u201d Referring to Conrad as a \u201ctalented, tormented man\u201d, Achebe notes that Conrad (via the protagonist, Charles Marlow) reduces and degrades Africans to \u201climbs\u201d, \u201cangles\u201d, \u201cglistening white eyeballs\u201d, etc. while simultaneously (and fearfully) suspecting a common kinship between himself and these natives\u2014leading Marlow to sneer the word \u201cugly.\u201d[42] Achebe also cited Conrad\u2019s description of an encounter with an African: \u201cA certain enormous buck nigger encountered in Haiti fixed my conception of blind, furious, unreasoning rage, as manifested in the human animal to the end of my days.\u201d[43] Achebe\u2019s essay, a landmark in postcolonial discourse, provoked debate and the questions it raised have been addressed in most subsequent literary criticism of Conrad.[44][45], 333163=By Angelo M. Codevilla \u2013 From the July 2010 \u2013 August 2010 issue As over-leveraged investment houses began to fail in September 2008, the leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties, of major corporations, and opinion leaders stretching from the National Review magazine (and the Wall Street Journal) on the right to the Nation magazine on the left, agreed that spending some $700 billion to buy the investors\u2019 \u201ctoxic assets\u201d was the only alternative to the U.S. economy\u2019s \u201csystemic collapse.\u201d In this, President George W. Bush and his would-be Republican successor John McCain agreed with the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama. Many, if not most, people around them also agreed upon the eventual commitment of some 10 trillion nonexistent dollars in ways unprecedented in America. They explained neither the difference between the assets\u2019 nominal and real values, nor precisely why letting the market find the latter would collapse America. The public objected immediately, by margins of three or four to one., 846287=For the week ending June 7, 24% of Americans said the economy is excellent or good while 30% said it is poor, resulting in a current conditions score of -6. The economic outlook score of -12, the lowest score for this component since early May, is the result of 42% of Americans saying the economy is getting better and 54% saying it is getting worse., 643664=PPFA is a federation of 85 independent Planned Parenthood affiliates around the U.S.[1] These affiliates together operate more than 820 health centers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[1][32] The largest of these facilities, a $26 million, 78,000-square-foot (7,200 m2) structure was completed in Houston, Texas in May 2010.[33] This serves as a headquarters for 12 clinics in Texas and Louisiana.[33] Together, they are the largest family planning services provider in the U.S. with over four million activists, supporters and donors.[34][35][36] Planned Parenthood is staffed by 27,000 staff members and volunteers.[37], 199846=Conrad, 1916, 267646=After the publication of Chance in 1913, Conrad was the subject of more discussion and praise than any other English writer of the time. He had a genius for companionship, and his circle of friends, which he had begun assembling even prior to his first publications, included authors and other leading lights in the arts, such as Henry James, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, John Galsworthy, Edward Garnett, Garnett\u2019s wife Constance Garnett (translator of Russian literature), Stephen Crane, Hugh Walpole, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Norman Douglas, Jacob Epstein, T. E. Lawrence, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Maurice Ravel, Valery Larbaud, Saint-John Perse, Edith Wharton,James Huneker, anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski, J\u00f3zef Retinger (later a founder of the European Movement, which led to the European Union, and author of Conrad and His Contemporaries). Conrad encouraged and mentored younger writers.[2] In the early 1900s he composed a short series of novels in collaboration with Ford Madox Ford.[53], 717902=Sanger became estranged from her husband in 1913, and the couple\u2019s divorce was finalized in 1921.[35] Sanger\u2019s second husband was Noah Slee. He followed Sanger around the world and provided much of Sanger\u2019s financial assistance. The couple got married in September 1922, but the public did not know about it until February 1924. They supported each other with their pre-commitments.[36], 125207=Joseph Conrad (born J\u00f3zef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski; 3 December 1857\u00a0\u2013 3 August 1924) is regarded as one of the greatest novelists in English.[1] He was granted British nationality in 1886, but always considered himself a Pole.[2][note 1] Though he did not speak English fluently until he was in his twenties (and always with a marked accent), he was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English sensibility into English literature.[note 2][3] He wrote stories and novels, many with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit., 756574=Sanger opposed censorship throughout her career, with a zeal comparable to her support for birth control. Sanger grew up in a home where iconoclastic orator Robert Ingersoll was admired.[103] During the early years of her activism, Sanger viewed birth control primarily as a free-speech issue, rather than as a feminist issue, and when she started publishing The Woman Rebel in 1914, she did so with the express goal of provoking a legal challenge to the Comstock laws banning dissemination of information about contraception.[21] In New York, Emma Goldman introduced Sanger to members of the Free Speech League, such as Edward Bliss Foote and Theodore Schroeder, and subsequently the League provided funding and advice to help Sanger with legal battles.[104], 724489=In 1928, conflict within the birth control movement leadership led Sanger to resign as the president of the ABCL and take full control of the CRB, renaming it the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau (BCCRB), marking the beginning of a schism in the movement that would last until 1938.[48], 854586=Confidence in the police, at 52% this year, ties the low for that institution recorded in the first year it was measured, 1993. In the past year, the police have been a major focus of news coverage in several incidents in which white police officers\u2019 actions resulted in the deaths of black men they were trying to apprehend., 876536=The year 2014 also saw the rise of terrorist group ISIS and racial riots in Ferguson, Missouri, and St. Louis after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in August. By 2015, riots had broken out in Baltimore, Maryland, over the shooting of Freddie Gray., 204817=Many of Conrad\u2019s characters were inspired by actual persons he had met, including, in his first novel, Almayer\u2019s Folly (completed 1894), William Charles Olmeijer, the spelling of whose name Conrad, probably inadvertently, altered to \u201cAlmayer.\u201d[10]:11, 40 The historic trader Olmeijer, whom Conrad encountered on his four short visits to Berau in Borneo, subsequently haunted Conrad\u2019s imagination.[10]:40\u20131 Conrad frequently borrowed the authentic names of actual individuals, e.g., Captain McWhirr[note 19] (Typhoon), Captain Beard and Mr. Mahon (\u201cYouth\u201c), Captain Lingard (Almayer\u2019s Folly and elsewhere), Captain Ellis (The Shadow Line). \u201cConrad,\u201d writes J. I. M. Stewart, \u201cappears to have attached some mysterious significance to such links with actuality.\u201d[10]:11\u201312 Equally curious is \u201ca great deal of namelessness in Conrad, requiring some minor virtuosity to maintain.\u201d[10]:244 We never learn the surname of the protagonist of Lord Jim.[10]:95 Conrad also preserves, in The Nigger of the \u2018Narcissus\u2019, the authentic name of the ship, the Narcissus, in which he sailed in 1884.[2]:98\u2013100, 714073=In 1917, she started publishing the monthly periodical Birth Control Review.[note 3], 712979=This page from Sanger\u2019s Family Limitation, 1917 edition, describes a cervical cap., 860880=Gallup\u2019s June 2-7 poll found confidence in the presidency rising slightly to 33% from 29% last year, which in turn was just four percentage points above the historical low of 25% in 2007. The uptick in confidence in the presidency this year is consistent with Americans\u2019 higher job approval ratings of President Barack Obama since last fall., 727417=Sanger\u2019s Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau operated from this New York building from 1930 to 1973., 340846=Sooner or later, well or badly, that majority\u2019s demand for representation will be filled. Whereas in 1968 Governor George Wallace\u2019s taunt \u201cthere ain\u2019t a dime\u2019s worth of difference\u201d between the Republican and Democratic parties resonated with only 13.5 percent of the American people, in 1992 Ross Perot became a serious contender for the presidency (at one point he was favored by 39 percent of Americans vs. 31 percent for G.H.W. Bush and 25 percent for Clinton) simply by speaking ill of the ruling class. Today, few speak well of the ruling class. Not only has it burgeoned in size and pretense, but it also has undertaken wars it has not won, presided over a declining economy and mushrooming debt, made life more expensive, raised taxes, and talked down to the American people. Americans\u2019 conviction that the ruling class is as hostile as it is incompetent has solidified. The polls tell us that only about a fifth of Americans trust the government to do the right thing. The rest expect that it will do more harm than good and are no longer afraid to say so., 166349=Financial success long eluded Conrad, who often asked magazine and book publishers for advances, and acquaintances (notably John Galsworthy) for loans.[2][note 12] Eventually a government grant (\u201cCivil List pension\u201d) of \u00a3100 per annum, awarded on 9 August 1910, somewhat relieved his financial worries,[2]:420 [note 13] and in time collectors began purchasing his manuscripts. Though his talent was early on recognised by the English intellectual elite, popular success eluded him until the 1913 publication of Chance\u00a0\u2013 paradoxically, one of his weaker novels., 67812=A Summer Story is a British drama film released in 1988. Directed by Piers Haggard, with a script written by Penelope Mortimer, it stars James Wilby, Imogen Stubbs, and Susannah York.[1] In 1902, a young gentleman visiting a rural area has an intense love affair with a village girl. Twenty years later, he is passing that way again. The film is based on the John Galsworthy story The Apple Tree., 636937=Faye Wattleton was the first woman named president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1978 and served till 1992.[18] She was the first African-American to serve as president, and the youngest president in Planned Parenthood\u2019s history.[19] During her term, Planned Parenthood grew to become the seventh largest charity in the country, providing services to four million clients each year through its 170 affiliates whose activities were spread across 50 states.[20], 875987=Americans witnessed the debt-ceiling crisis in October 2013, which resulted in the shutdown of the federal government and furlough of federal workers., 629359=The organization has its roots in Brooklyn, New York, where Margaret Sanger opened the country\u2019s first birth-control clinic. Sanger founded the American Birth Control League in 1921, which in 1942 became part of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Since then, Planned Parenthood has grown to have over 820 clinic locations in the U.S., with a total budget of US $1 billion. PPFA provides an array of services to over three million people in the United States, and supports services for over one million clients outside the United States., 851640=Americans\u2019 confidence in most major institutions has been down for many years as the nation has dealt with prolonged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a major recession and sluggish economic improvement, and partisan gridlock in Washington. In fact, 2004 was the last year most institutions were at or above their historical average levels of confidence. Perhaps not coincidentally, 2004 was also the last year Americans\u2019 satisfaction with the way things are going in the United States averaged better than 40%. Currently, 28% of Americans are satisfied with the state of the nation., 143649=Conrad had been at the establishment for just over a year when in September 1874, for uncertain reasons, his uncle removed him from school in Lw\u00f3w and took him back to Krak\u00f3w., 874881=In 2004, President George W. Bush was re-elected and the U.S. transferred sovereignty and control of Iraq back to the Iraqi people., 650125=Planned Parenthood has received federal funding since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed into law the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act, amending the Public Health Service Act. Title X of that law provides funding for family planning services, including contraception and family planning information. The law enjoyed bipartisan support from liberals who saw contraception access as increasing families\u2019 control over their lives, and conservatives who saw it as a way to keep people off welfare. Nixon described Title X funding as based on the premise that \u201cno American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition.\u201d[43], 242186=Conrad spoke both his native Polish language and the French language fluently from childhood and only acquired English in his twenties. Why then did he choose to write his books in, effectively, his third language? He states in his preface to A Personal Record that writing in English was for him \u201cnatural\u201d, and that the idea of his having made a deliberate choice between English and French, as some had suggested, was in error. He explained that, though he was familiar with French from childhood, \u201cI would have been afraid to attempt expression in a language so perfectly \u2018crystallized\u2019.\u201d[38]:iv-x In a 1915 conversation with American sculptor Jo Davidson, as he posed for his bust, in response to Davidson\u2019s question Conrad said: \u201cAh\u2026 to write French you have to know it. English is so plastic\u2014if you haven\u2019t got a word you need you can make it, but to write French you have to be an artist like Anatole France.\u201d[39] These statements, as so often happens in Conrad\u2019s \u201cautobiographical\u201d writings, are subtly disingenuous.[2] In 1897 Conrad was paid a visit by a fellow Pole, Wincenty Lutos\u0142awski, who was intent on imploring Conrad to write in Polish and \u201cto win Conrad for Polish literature\u201d. Lutos\u0142awski recalls that during their conversation Conrad explained why he did not write in Polish: \u201cI value too much our beautiful Polish literature to introduce into it my worthless twaddle. But for Englishmen my capacities are just sufficient: they enable me to earn my living\u201d. Perhaps revealingly, Conrad later wrote to Lutos\u0142awski to keep his visit a secret.[40], 384082=Rather, even as our ruling class has lectured, cajoled, and sometimes intruded violently to reform foreign countries in its own image, it has apologized to them for America not having matched that image \u2014 their private image. Woodrow Wilson began this double game in 1919, when he assured Europe\u2019s peoples that America had mandated him to demand their agreement to Article X of the peace treaty (the League of Nations) and then swore to the American people that Article X was the Europeans\u2019 non-negotiable demand. The fact that the U.S. government had seized control of transatlantic cable communications helped hide (for a while) that the League scheme was merely the American Progressives\u2019 private dream. In our time, this double game is quotidian on the evening news. Notably, President Obama apologized to Europe because \u201cthe United States has fallen short of meeting its responsibilities\u201d to reduce carbon emissions by taxation. But the American people never assumed such responsibility, and oppose doing so. Hence President Obama was not apologizing for anything that he or anyone he respected had done, but rather blaming his fellow Americans for not doing what he thinks they should do while glossing over the fact that the Europeans had done the taxing but not the reducing. Wilson redux., 607278=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/15/health/planned-parenthood-undercover-video/, 478836=In Goldwater v. Carter,[10] Congress challenged the constitutionality of then-president Jimmy Carter\u2018s unilateral termination of a defense treaty. The case went before the Supreme Court and was never heard; a majority of six Justices ruled that the case should be dismissed without hearing an oral argument, holding that \u201cThe issue at hand \u2026 was essentially a political question and could not be reviewed by the court, as Congress had not issued a formal opposition.\u201d In his opinion, Justice Brennan dissented, \u201cThe issue of decision making authority must be resolved as a matter of constitutional law, not political discretion; accordingly, it falls within the competence of the courts\u201d. Presently, there is no official ruling on whether the President has the power to break a treaty without the approval of Congress, and the courts also declined to interfere when President George W. Bush unilaterally withdrew the United States from the ABM Treaty in 2002, six months after giving the required notice of intent.[11], 960860=A recurring theme of human history has been resilience and revival. The country profiles in the 2015 Index of Economic Freedom include many examples of countries that have accelerated their economic and social progress in the face of difficult challenges and a sometimes harsh international environment. Their successes can be emulated by others. The Index of Economic Freedom charts not just one path to development, but as many as the ingenuity of humans can produce when they are free to experiment andinnovate., 151078=In 1874 Conrad left Poland to start a merchant-marine career. After nearly four years in France and on French ships, he joined the British merchant marine and for the next fifteen years served under the Red Ensign. He worked on a variety of ships as crew member (steward, apprentice, able-bodied seaman) and then as third, second and first mate, until eventually achieving captain\u2019s rank. Of his 19-year merchant-marine career, only about half was spent actually at sea., 703633=Sanger\u2019s political interests, emerging feminism and nursing experience led her to write two series of columns on sex education entitled \u201cWhat Every Mother Should Know\u201d (1911\u201312) and \u201cWhat Every Girl Should Know\u201d (1912-13) for the socialist magazine New York Call. By the standards of the day, Sanger\u2019s articles were extremely frank in their discussion of sexuality, and many New York Call readers were outraged by them. Other readers, however, praised the series for its candor, one stated that the series contained \u201ca purer morality than whole libraries full of hypocritical cant about modesty.[9] Both were later published in book form in 1916.[10], 638594=From 1996 to 2006, Planned Parenthood was led by Gloria Feldt.[21][22] Feldt activated the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the organization\u2019s political action committee, launching what was the most far reaching electoral advocacy effort in its history.[23] She also launched the Responsible Choices Action Agenda, a nationwide campaign to increase services to prevent unwanted pregnancies, improve quality of reproductive care and ensure access to safe and legal abortions.[13] Another initiative was the commencement of a \u201cGlobal Partnership Program\u201d with the aim of building a vibrant activist constituency in support of family planning.[13], 263298=In Circular Quay, Sydney, Australia, a plaque in a \u201cwriters walk\u201d commemorates Conrad\u2019s visits to Australia between 1879 and 1892. The plaque notes that \u201cMany of his works reflect his \u2018affection for that young continent.'\u201d[52], 713214=Some countries in northwestern Europe had more liberal policies towards contraception than the United States at the time, and when Sanger visited a Dutch birth control clinic in 1915, she learned about diaphragms and became convinced that they were a more effective means of contraception than the suppositories and douches that she had been distributing back in the United States.

In \u201cA Plan for Peace\u201d, a 1932 essay, she proposed a congressional department to address population problems. She also recommended that immigration exclude those \u201cwhose condition is known to be detrimental to the stamina of the race,\u201d and that sterilization and segregation be applied to those with incurable, hereditary disabilities.[86][87][94], 225615=He also borrowed from other, Polish- and French-language authors, to an extent sometimes skirting plagiarism. When the Polish translation of his 1915 novel Victory appeared in 1931, readers noted striking similarities to Stefan \u017beromski\u2018s kitschy novel, The History of a Sin (Dzieje grzechu, 1908), including their endings. Comparative-literature scholar Yves Hervouet has demonstrated in the text of Victory a whole mosaic of influences, borrowings, similarities and allusions. He further lists hundreds of concrete borrowings from other, mostly French authors in nearly all of Conrad\u2019s works, from Almayer\u2019s Folly (1895) to his unfinished Suspense. Conrad seems to have used eminent writers\u2019 texts as raw material of the same kind as the content of his own memory. Materials borrowed from other authors often functioned as allusions. Moreover, he had a phenomenal memory for texts and remembered details, \u201cbut [writes Najder] it was not a memory strictly categorized according to sources, marshalled into homogeneous entities; it was, rather, an enormous receptacle of images and pieces from which he would draw.\u201d[2]:454\u20137, 729686=In 1937, Sanger became chairman of the newly formed Birth Control Council of America, and attempted to resolve the schism between the ABCL and the BCCRB.[58] Her efforts were successful, and the two organizations merged in 1939 as the Birth Control Federation of America.[59][note 5] Although Sanger continued in the role of president, she no longer wielded the same power as she had in the early years of the movement, and in 1942, more conservative forces within the organization changed the name to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a name Sanger objected to because she considered it too euphemistic.[60], 873913=image: http://www.wnd.com/files/2015/06/gallup_2015.jpg, 151813=Most of Conrad\u2019s stories and novels, and many of their characters, were drawn from his seafaring career and persons whom he had met or heard about. For his fictional characters he often borrowed the authentic names of actual persons. The historic trader William Charles Olmeijer, whom Conrad encountered on four short visits to Berau in Borneo, appears as \u201cAlmayer\u201d (possibly a simple misspelling) in Conrad\u2019s first novel, Almayer\u2019s Folly. Other authentic names include those of Captain McWhirr (in Typhoon), Captain Beard and Mr. Mahon (Youth), Captain Lingard (Almayer\u2019s Folly and elsewhere), and Captain Ellis (The Shadow Line). Conrad also preserves, in The Nigger of the \u2018Narcissus\u2019, the authentic name of the Narcissus, a ship in which he sailed in 1884., 466730=She urged Iran to release three \u201cunjustly imprisoned\u201d Americans and to determine the whereabouts of Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who vanished in Iran in 2007., 130712=Nowy \u015awiat 47, Warsaw, where three-year-old Conrad lived with his parents in 1861. In front: a \u201cChopin\u2019s Warsaw\u201d bench., 158882=In 1894, aged 36, Conrad reluctantly gave up the sea, partly because of poor health, partly due to unavailability of ships, and partly because he had become so fascinated with writing that he had decided on a literary career. His first novel, Almayer\u2019s Folly, set on the east coast of Borneo, was published in 1895. Its appearance marked his first use of the pen name \u201cJoseph Conrad\u201d; \u201cKonrad\u201d was, of course, the third of his Polish given names, but his use of it\u00a0\u2013 in the anglicised version, \u201cConrad\u201d\u00a0\u2013 may also have been an homage to the Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz\u2018s patriotic narrative poem, Konrad Wallenrod.[13], 729193=This 1936 contraception court victory was the culmination of Sanger\u2019s birth control efforts, and she took the opportunity, now in her late 50s, to move to Tucson, Arizona, intending to play a less critical role in the birth control movement. In spite of her original intentions, she remained active in the movement through the 1950s.[57], 679258=Periodically pro-life activists have tried to demonstrate that Planned Parenthood does not follow applicable state or federal laws. The groups called or visited a Planned Parenthood health center posing as victims of statutory rape,[103] minors who would need parental notification for abortion,[104][105] racists seeking to earmark donations for abortions for black women to abort black babies,[106] or pimps who want abortions for child prostitutes.[107] Edited video and audio productions of these dialogues seem to capture employees being sympathetic to potentially criminal acts, leading to allegations that the health centers in question are violating the law. An official federal inspection in 2005 by the Bush administration\u2018s Department of Health and Human Services \u201cyielded no evidence of clinics around the nation failing to comply with laws on reporting child abuse, child molestation, sexual abuse, rape or incest.\u201d[104], 613743=Richards is the daughter of former Texas governor Ann Richards (n\u00e9e Dorothy Ann Willis) and David Richards.[3] She attended St. Stephen\u2019s Episcopal School for high school, and graduated from Brown University in 1980.[8] She is married to Kirk Adams, a labor organizer with the Service Employees International Union, and has three children.[9] She currently lives in New York City.[10], 877818=\u201cAmericans continue to show lower levels of confidence in most of the major institutions central to U.S. society, with only the military and small business getting ratings in 2015 that are above their historical averages,\u201d the Gallup spokesman said., 133682=The Korzeniowski family played a significant role in Polish attempts to regain independence. Conrad\u2019s paternal grandfather served under Prince J\u00f3zef Poniatowski during Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign and formed his own cavalry squadron during the November 1830 Uprising.[11] Conrad\u2019s fiercely patriotic father belonged to the \u201cRed\u201d political faction, whose goal was to re-establish the pre-partition boundaries of Poland, but which also advocated land reform and the abolition of serfdom. Conrad\u2019s subsequent refusal to follow in Apollo\u2019s footsteps, and his choice of exile over resistance, were a source of lifelong guilt for Conrad.[12][note 4], 246020=Had Conrad remained in the Francophone sphere or had he returned to Poland, the son of the Polish poet, playwright and translator Apollo Korzeniowski\u00a0\u2013 from childhood exposed to Polish and foreign literature, and ambitious to himself become a writer[2]:43\u201344 \u2013might have ended writing in French or Polish instead of English. Certainly his mentor-uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski thought Conrad might write in Polish; in an 1881 letter he advised his 23-year-old nephew:, 84130=Because of its terrorism theme, it was noted as \u201cone of the three works of literature most cited in the American media\u201d two weeks after the September 11 attacks.[4], 790164=Posted on July 7, 2015.

For example, the health care bill of 2010 takes more than 2,700 pages to make sure not just that some states will be treated differently from others because their senators offered key political support, but more importantly to codify bargains between the government and various parts of the health care industry, state governments, and large employers about who would receive what benefits (e.g., public employee unions and auto workers) and who would pass what indirect taxes onto the general public. The financial regulation bill of 2010, far from setting univocal rules for the entire financial industry in few words, spends some 3,000 pages (at this writing) tilting the field exquisitely toward some and away from others. Even more significantly, these and other products of Democratic and Republican administrations and Congresses empower countless boards and commissions arbitrarily to protect some persons and companies, while ruining others. Thus in 2008 the Republican administration first bailed out Bear Stearns, then let Lehman Brothers sink in the ensuing panic, but then rescued Goldman Sachs by infusing cash into its principal debtor, AIG. Then, its Democratic successor used similarly naked discretionary power (and money appropriated for another purpose) to give major stakes in the auto industry to labor unions that support it. Nowadays, the members of our ruling class admit that they do not read the laws. They don\u2019t have to. Because modern laws are primarily grants of discretion, all anybody has to know about them is whom they empower., 367627=In America, the process by which party has become (almost) as important began with the Supreme Court\u2019s 1962 decision in Baker v. Carr which, by setting the single standard \u201cone man, one vote\u201d for congressional districts, ended up legalizing the practice of \u201cgerrymandering,\u201d concentrating the opposition party\u2019s voters into as few districts as possible while placing one\u2019s own voters into as many as possible likely to yield victories. Republican and Democratic state legislatures have gerrymandered for a half century. That is why today\u2019s Congress consists more and more of persons who represent their respective party establishments \u2014 not nearly as much as in Britain, but heading in that direction. Once districts are gerrymandered \u201csafe\u201d for one party or another, the voters therein count less because party leaders can count more on elected legislators to toe the party line., 664593=Planned Parenthood regional chapters have been active in the American courts. A number of cases in which Planned Parenthood has been a party have reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Notable among these cases is the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the case that sets forth the current constitutional abortion standard. In this case, \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u201d was the Southeast Pennsylvania Chapter, and \u201cCasey\u201d was Robert Casey, the governor of Pennsylvania. The ultimate ruling was split, and Roe v. Wade was narrowed but upheld in an opinion written by Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter. Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens concurred with the main decision in separately written opinions. The Supreme Court struck down spousal consent requirements for married women to obtain abortions, but found no \u201cundue burden\u201d\u2014an alternative to strict scrutiny which tests the allowable limitations on rights protected under the Constitution\u2014from the other statutory requirements. Dissenting were William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Byron White. Blackmun, Rehnquist, and White were the only justices who voted on the original Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 who were still on the Supreme Court to rule on this case, and their votes on this case were consistent with their votes on the original decision that legalized abortion.[76] Only Blackmun voted to maintain Roe v. Wade in its entirety., 131224=Joseph Conrad was born on 3 December 1857 in Berdychiv, in a part of Ukraine that had belonged to the Kingdom of Poland before 1793 and was at the time of his birth under Russianrule.[8] He was the only child of Apollo Korzeniowski and his wife Ewa Bobrowska. The father was a writer, translator, political activist, and would-be revolutionary. Conrad was christenedJ\u00f3zef Teodor Konrad after his maternal grandfather J\u00f3zef, his paternal grandfather Teodor, and the heroes (both named \u201cKonrad\u201d) of two poems by Adam Mickiewicz, Dziady andKonrad Wallenrod. He was subsequently known to his family as \u201cKonrad\u201d, rather than \u201cJ\u00f3zef\u201d., 354971=As their number and sense of importance grew, so did their distaste for common Americans. Believing itself \u201cscientific,\u201d this Progressive class sought to explain its differences from its neighbors in \u201cscientific\u201d terms. The most elaborate of these attempts was Theodor Adorno\u2019s widely acclaimed The Authoritarian Personality (1948). It invented a set of criteria by which to define personality traits, ranked these traits and their intensity in any given person on what it called the \u201cF scale\u201d (F for fascist), interviewed hundreds of Americans, and concluded that most who were not liberal Democrats were latent fascists. This way of thinking about non-Progressives filtered down to college curricula. In 1963-64 for example, I was assigned Herbert McCloskey\u2019s Conservatism and Personality (1958) at Rutgers\u2019s Eagleton Institute of Politics as a paradigm of methodological correctness. The author had defined conservatism in terms of answers to certain questions, had defined a number of personality disorders in terms of other questions, and run a survey that proved \u201cscientifically\u201d that conservatives were maladjusted ne\u2019er-do-well ignoramuses. (My class project, titled \u201cLiberalism and Personality,\u201d following the same methodology, proved just as scientifically that liberals suffered from the very same social diseases, and even more amusing ones.), 76375=Posted on July 28, 2015.

Conrad\u2019s poor health and his unsatisfactory schoolwork caused his uncle constant problems and no end of financial outlays. Conrad was not a good student; despite tutoring, he excelled only in geography.[2]:43 Since the boy\u2019s illness was clearly of nervous origin, the physicians supposed that fresh air and physical work would harden him; his uncle hoped that well-defined duties and the rigors of work would teach him discipline. Since he showed little inclination to study, it was essential that he learn a trade; his uncle saw him as a sailor-cum-businessman who would combine maritime skills with commercial activities.[2]:44\u201346 In fact, in the autumn of 1871, thirteen-year-old Conrad announced his intention to become a sailor. He later recalled that as a child he had read (apparently in French translation) Leopold McClintock\u2018s book about his 1857\u201359 expeditions in the Fox, in search of Sir John Franklin\u2018s lost ships Erebus and Terror.[note 6] He also recalled having read books by the American James Fenimore Cooper and the English Captain Frederick Marryat.[2]:41\u201342 A playmate of his adolescence recalled that Conrad spun fantastic yarns, always set at sea, presented so realistically that listeners thought the action was happening before their eyes., 375375=Since marriage is the family\u2019s fertile seed, government at all levels, along with \u201cmainstream\u201d academics and media, have waged war on it. They legislate, regulate, and exhort in support not of \u201cthe family\u201d \u2014 meaning married parents raising children \u2014 but rather of \u201cfamilies,\u201d meaning mostly households based on something other than marriage. The institution of no-fault divorce diminished the distinction between cohabitation and marriage \u2014 except that husbands are held financially responsible for the children they father, while out-of-wedlock fathers are not. The tax code penalizes marriage and forces those married couples who raise their own children to subsidize \u201cchild care\u201d for those who do not. Top Republicans and Democrats have also led society away from the very notion of marital fidelity by precept as well as by parading their affairs. For example, in 1997 the Democratic administration\u2019s secretary of defense and the Republican Senate\u2019s majority leader (joined by the New York Times et al.) condemned the military\u2019s practice of punishing officers who had extramarital affairs. While the military had assumed that honoring marital vows is as fundamental to the integrity of its units as it is to that of society, consensus at the top declared that insistence on fidelity is \u201ccontrary to societal norms.\u201d Not surprisingly, rates of marriage in America have decreased as out-of-wedlock births have increased. The biggest demographic consequence has been that about one in five of all households are women alone or with children, in which case they have about a four in 10 chance of living in poverty. Since unmarried mothers often are or expect to be clients of government services, it is not surprising that they are among the Democratic Party\u2019s most faithful voters., 156161=When Conrad left London on 25 October 1892 aboard the clipper ship Torrens, one of the passengers was William Henry Jacques, a consumptive Cambridge graduate who died less than a year later (19 September 1893) and was, according to Conrad\u2019s A Personal Record, the first reader of the still-unfinished manuscript of his Almayer\u2019s Folly. Jacques encouraged Conrad to continue writing the novel.[2]:181, 228281=Conrad, like other artists, faced constraints arising from the need to propitiate his audience and confirm its own favourable self-regard. This may account for his describing the admirable crew of the Judea in his 1898 story \u201cYouth\u201d as \u201cLiverpool hard cases\u201d, whereas the crew of the Judea\u2019s actual 1882 prototype, the Palestine, had included not a single Liverpudlian, and half the crew had been non-Britons;[2]:94 and for Conrad\u2019s turning the real-life 1880 criminally negligent British Captain J.

Clark, of the SS\u00a0Jeddah, in his 1900 novel Lord Jim, into the captain of the fictitious Patna\u00a0\u2013 \u201ca sort of renegade New South Wales German\u201d so monstrous in physical appearance as to suggest \u201ca trained baby elephant.\u201d[10]:98\u2013103 Similarly, in his letters Conrad\u00a0\u2013 during most of his literary career, struggling for sheer financial survival\u00a0\u2013 often adjusted his views to the predilections of his correspondents.[2]:105 And when he wished to criticise the conduct of European imperialism in what would later be termed the \u201cThird World\u201c, he turned his gaze upon the Dutchand Belgian colonies, not upon the British Empire.[2]:119, 185898=After many travails and vicissitudes, at the beginning of November 1914 Conrad managed to bring his family back to England. On his return, he was determined to work on swaying British opinion in favour of restoring Poland\u2019s sovereignty.[2]:464\u201368, 173555=Little is known about any intimate relationships that Conrad might have had prior to his marriage, confirming a popular image of the author as an isolated bachelor who preferred the company of close male friends.[19] However, in 1888 during a stop-over on Mauritius, Conrad developed a couple of romantic interests. One of these would be described in his 1910 story \u201cA Smile of Fortune\u201d, which contains autobiographical elements (e.g., one of the characters is the same Chief Mate Burns who appears in The Shadow Line). The narrator, a young captain, flirts ambiguously and surreptitiously with Alice Jacobus, daughter of a local merchant living in a house surrounded by a magnificent rose garden. Research has confirmed that in Port Louis at the time there was a 17-year-old Alice Shaw, whose father, a shipping agent, owned the only rose garden in town.[2]:126\u201327, 525878=Posted on July 18, 2015.

Every December, they are reminded that the ruling class deems the very word \u201cChristmas\u201d to be offensive. Every time they try to manifest their religious identity in public affairs, they are deluged by accusations of being \u201cAmerican Taliban\u201d trying to set up a \u201ctheocracy.\u201d Let members of the country class object to anything the ruling class says or does, and likely as not their objection will be characterized as \u201creligious,\u201d that is to say irrational, that is to say not to be considered on a par with the \u201cscience\u201d of which the ruling class is the sole legitimate interpreter. Because aggressive, intolerant secularism is the moral and intellectual basis of the ruling class\u2019s claim to rule, resistance to that rule, whether to the immorality of economic subsidies and privileges, or to the violation of the principle of equal treatment under equal law, or to its seizure of children\u2019s education, must deal with secularism\u2019s intellectual and moral core. This lies beyond the boundaries of politics as the term is commonly understood., 222788=Conrad was keenly conscious of tragedy in the world and in his works. In 1898, at the start of his writing career, he had written to his Scottish writer-politician friend Cunninghame Graham: \u201cWhat makes mankind tragic is not that they are the victims of nature, it is that they are conscious of it. [A]s soon as you know of your slavery the pain, the anger, the strife\u00a0\u2013 the tragedy begins.\u201d But in 1922, near the end of his life and career, when another Scottish friend, Richard Curle, sent Conrad proofs of two articles he had written about Conrad, the latter objected to being characterised as a gloomy and tragic writer. \u201cThat reputation\u2026 has deprived me of innumerable readers\u2026 I absolutely object to being called a tragedian.\u201d[2]:544\u20135, 32735=Karla is modelled on KGB Gen.

On 28 July 1914, the day war broke out between Austro-Hungary and Serbia, Conrad and the Retingers arrived in Krak\u00f3w (then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire), where Conrad visited childhood haunts. As the city lay only a few miles from the Russian border, there was a risk of getting stranded in a battle zone. With wife Jessie and younger son John ill, Conrad decided to take refuge in the mountain resort town of Zakopane. They left Krak\u00f3w on 2 August. A few days after arrival in Zakopane, they moved to the Konstantyn\u00f3wka pension operated by Conrad\u2019s cousin Aniela Zag\u00f3rska; it had been frequented by celebrities including the statesman J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski and Conrad\u2019s acquaintance, the young concert pianist Artur Rubinstein.[2]:458\u201363, 862975=The average confidence rating for the three branches of government combined is 24%, lower than most previous averages since 1991 and well below the high of 50% that year., 632688=In 1938, the clinic was organized into the American Birth Control League, which became part of the only national birth control organization in the US until the 1960s, but the title was found too offensive and \u201cagainst families\u201d so the League began discussions for a new name.[12] By 1941, the organization was operating 222 centers and had served 49,000 clients.[13] By 1942 the League had become part of what became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.[12], 710734=Margaret Sanger spent much of her 1914 exile in England, where contact with British neo-Malthusianists helped refine her socioeconomic justifications for birth control. She was also profoundly influenced by the liberation theories of British sexual theorist Havelock Ellis. Under his tutelage she formulated a new rationale that would liberate women not just by making sexual intercourse safe, but also pleasurable. It would, in effect, free women from the inequality of sexual experience. Early in 1915, Margaret Sanger\u2019s estranged husband, William Sanger, was entrapped into giving a copy of Family Limitation to a representative of anti-vice crusader Anthony Comstock. William Sanger was tried and convicted, he spent thirty days in jail, while also escalating interest in birth control as a civil liberties issue.[23][24][25], 194697=In a 23 October 1922 letter to mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell, in response to the latter\u2019s book, The Problem of China, which advocated socialist reforms and an oligarchy of sages who would reshape Chinese society, Conrad explained his own distrust of political panaceas:, 634861=Following Margaret Sanger, Alan Frank Guttmacher became president of Planned Parenthood and served from 1962 till 1974.[15] During his tenure, the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of the original birth control pill, giving rise to new attitudes towards women\u2019s reproductive freedom.[13] Also during his presidency, Planned Parenthood lobbied the federal government to support reproductive health, culminating with President Richard Nixon\u2018s signing of Title X to provide governmental subsidies for low-income women to access family planning services.[16] The Center for Family Planning Program Development was also founded as a semi-autonomous division during this time.[17] The center became an independent organization and was renamed the Guttmacher Institute in 1977.[17], 945196=The findings of the 2015 Index once again demonstrate the strongly positive linkages between economic freedom and various dimensions of human development. Many of the linkages are straightforward: Higher taxes, for example, reduce investment and hurt job growth. Others, such as the impact on economic growth from the promotion of property rights or the maintenance of a stable monetary system, are more intricate, multidimensional, and nonlinear., 38574=Swedish director Tomas Alfredson made a film adaptation in 2011 based on a screenplay by Bridget O\u2019Connor and Peter Straughan. The film was released in the UK and Ireland on 16 September 2011, and in the United States on 9 December 2011. It included acameo appearance by John le Carr\u00e9 in the Christmas party scene as the older man in the grey suit who stands suddenly to sing the Soviet anthem. The film received numerous Academy Award nominations including a nomination for Best Actor for Gary Oldman for his role as George Smiley. The film also starred Colin Firth as Bill Haydon, Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillam, Tom Hardy as Ricki Tarr, and Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux., 341925=While Europeans are accustomed to being ruled by presumed betters whom they distrust, the American people\u2019s realization of being ruled like Europeans shocked this country into well nigh revolutionary attitudes. But only the realization was new. The ruling class had sunk deep roots in America over decades before 2008. Machiavelli compares serious political diseases to the Aetolian fevers \u2014 easy to treat early on while they are difficult to discern, but virtually untreatable by the time they become obvious., 223917=Conrad claimed that he \u201cnever kept a diary and never owned a notebook.\u201d John Galsworthy, who knew him well, described this as \u201ca statement which surprised no one who knew the resources of his memory and the brooding nature of his creative spirit.\u201d[33]Nevertheless, after Conrad\u2019s death, Richard Curle published a heavily modified version of Conrad\u2019s diaries describing his experiences in the Congo;[34] in 1978 a more complete version was published as The Congo Diary and Other Uncollected Pieces.[35], 744764=As part of her efforts to promote birth control, Sanger found common cause with proponents of eugenics, believing that they both sought to \u201cassist the race toward the elimination of the unfit.\u201d[84] Sanger was a proponent of negative eugenics, which aims to improve human hereditary traits through social intervention by reducing the reproduction of those who were considered unfit. In \u201cThe Morality of Birth Control,\u201d a 1921 speech, she divided society into three groups: the educated and informed class that regulated the size of their families, the intelligent and responsible who desired to control their families however did not have the means or the knowledge and the irresponsible and reckless people whose religious scruples \u201cprevent their exercising control over their numbers.\u201d Sanger concludes \u201cthere is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped.\u201d[85] Sanger\u2019s eugenic policies included an exclusionary immigration policy, free access to birth control methods and full family planning autonomy for the able-minded, and compulsory segregation or sterilization for the \u201cprofoundly retarded\u201d.[86][87] In her book The Pivot of Civilization, she advocated coercion to prevent the \u201cundeniably feeble-minded\u201d from procreating.[88] Although Sanger supported negative eugenics, she asserted that eugenics alone was not sufficient, and that birth control was essential to achieve her goals.[89][90][91], 698228=Sanger was born Margaret Louise Higgins in 1879 in Corning, New York,[3] to Michael Hennessey Higgins, an Irish-born stonemason and free-thinker, and Anne Purcell Higgins, a Catholic Irish-American. Michael Hennessey Higgins had emigrated to the USA at age 14 and joined the U.S. Army as a drummer at age 15, during the Civil War. After leaving the army, Michael studied medicine and phrenology, but ultimately became a stonecutter, making stone angels, saints, and tombstones.[4] Michael H. Higgins was a Catholic who became an atheist and an activist for women\u2019s suffrage and free public education.[5] Anne Higgins went through 18 pregnancies (with 11 live births) in 22 years before dying at the age of 49. Sanger was the sixth of eleven surviving children,[6] and spent much of her youth assisting with household chores and caring for her younger siblings. Anne\u2019s parents took their children and emigrated to Canada when she was a child, due to the Potato Famine., 861240=Meanwhile, ratings of the Supreme Court and Congress, which had dropped to record lows in 2014, have barely moved., 651406=In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, total (consolidated) revenue was $201 million: clinic revenue totaling $2 million, grants and donations of $190 million, investment income of $2 million, and $7 million other income.[44] Approximately two-thirds of the revenue is put towards the provision of health services, while non-medical services such as sex education and public policy work make up another 16%; management expenses, fundraising, and international family planning programs account for most of the rest., 751916=Such attitudes did not keep her from collaborating with African-American leaders and professionals who saw a need for birth control in their communities. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York\u2019s Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.[96] Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with black doctors, in 1930. The clinic was directed by a 15-member advisory board consisting of black doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. The clinic was publicized in the African-American press and in black churches, and it received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, founder of the NAACP.[97] In 1939 Sanger wrote, \u201cWe should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We don\u2019t want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.\u201d She did not tolerate bigotry among her staff, nor would she tolerate any refusal to work within interracial projects.[98] Sanger\u2019s work with minorities earned praise from Martin Luther King, Jr., in his 1966 acceptance speech for the Margaret Sanger award.[99], 195205=I have never [found] in any man\u2019s book or\u2026 talk anything\u2026 to stand up\u2026 against my deep-seated sense of fatality governing this man-inhabited world\u2026. The only remedy for Chinamen and for the rest of us is [a] change of hearts, but looking at the history of the last 2000 years there is not much reason to expect [it], even if man has taken to flying \u2013 a great \u201cuplift\u201d no doubt but no great change\u2026.[2]:548\u20139, 671698=Planned Parenthood has occupied a central position in the abortion debate in the U.S., and has been among the most prominent targets of U.S. pro-life activists for decades. Congressional Republicans have attempted since the 1980s to defund the organization,[45] nearly leading to a government shutdown over the issue in 2011.[86] The federal money received by Planned Parenthood is not used to fund abortion services, but pro-life activists have argued that the funding frees up other resources which are, in turn, used to provide abortions.[45], 240420=What is the essence of Conrad\u2019s art? It surely is not the plot, which he\u00a0\u2013 like Shakespeare\u00a0\u2013 often borrows from public sources and which could be duplicated by lesser authors; the plot serves merely as the vehicle for what the author has to say. A focus on plot leads to the absurdity of Charles and Mary Lamb\u2018s 1807 Tales from Shakespeare. Rather, Conrad\u2019s essence is to be sought in his depiction of the world open to our senses, and in the world view that he has evolved in the course of experiencing that outer, and his own inner, world. An evocative part of that view is expressed in an August 1901 letter that Conrad wrote to the editor of The New York Times Saturday Book Review:, 647605=In 2009, Planned Parenthood provided 4,009,549 contraceptive services (35% of total), 3,955,926 sexually transmitted disease services (35% of total), 1,830,811 cancer related services (16% of total), 1,178,369 pregnancy/prenatal/midlife services (10% of total), 332,278 abortion services (3% of total), and 76,977 other services (1% of total), for a total of 11,383,900 services.[9][37][39][40][41][42] The organization also said its doctors and nurses annually conduct 1 million screenings for cervical cancer and 830,000 breast exams., 385394=Similarly, Obama \u201capologized\u201d to Europeans because some Americans \u2014 not him and his friends \u2014 had shown \u201carrogance and been dismissive\u201d toward them, and to the world because President Truman had used the atom bomb to end World War II. So President Clinton apologized to Africans because some Americans held African slaves until 1865 and others were mean to Negroes thereafter \u2014 not himself and his friends, of course. So assistant secretary of state Michael Posner apologized to Chinese diplomats for Arizona\u2019s law that directs police to check immigration status. Republicans engage in that sort of thing as well: former Soviet dictator Mikhail Gorbachev tells us that in 1987 then vice president George H. W. Bush distanced himself from his own administration by telling him, \u201cReagan is a conservative, an extreme conservative. All the dummies and blockheads are with him\u2026\u201d This is all about a class of Americans distinguishing itself from its inferiors. It recalls the Pharisee in the Temple: \u201cLord, I thank thee that I am not like other men\u2026\u201d, 720448=Sanger\u2019s appeal of her conviction for the Brownsville clinic secured a 1918 court ruling that exempted physicians from the law that prohibited the distribution of contraceptive information to women\u2014provided it was prescribed for medical reasons\u2014she established the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB) in 1923 to exploit this loophole.[8][39] The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, and it was staffed entirely by female doctors and social workers.[40] The clinic received a large amount of funding from John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his family, which continued to make donations to Sanger\u2019s causes in future decades, but generally made them anonymously to avoid public exposure of the family name,[41] and to protect family member Nelson Rockefeller\u2018s political career since openly advocating birth control could have led to the Catholic Church opposing him politically.[42] John D. Rockefeller Jr. donated five thousand dollars to her American Birth Control League in 1924 and a second time in 1925.[43] In 1922, she traveled to China, Korea, and Japan. In China she observed that the primary method of family planning was female infanticide, and she later worked with Pearl Buck to establish a family planning clinic in Shanghai.[44] Sanger visited Japan six times, working with Japanese feminist Kato Shidzue to promote birth control.[45] This was ironic since ten years earlier Sanger had accused Kat\u014d of murder and praised an attempt to kill her.[46], 1028680=President Barack Obama\u2019s second-term efforts to expand government spending and regulation have been thwarted to some extent by Republican Party opposition in Congress. Economic policy leadership has devolved by default to the Federal Reserve, whose attempts to use monetary policy to stimulate economic activity have not restored robust growth. Implementation of the 2010 health care law, which has reduced competition in most health insurance markets, remains a drag on job creation and full-time employment. Overall, the U.S. economy continues to underperform, despite a private sector\u2013led energy boom that has made the U.S. the world\u2019s largest producer of oil and natural gas. The weak economic recovery and uncertain responses to foreign policy challenges, particularly in the Middle East, in Ukraine, and along the southern U.S. border, have contributed to a loss of support for the President and his party and Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress as a result of 2014 midterm elections., 719373=After World War I, Sanger shifted away from radical politics, and she founded the American Birth Control League (ABCL) in 1921 to enlarge her base of supporters to include the middle class.[37] The founding principles of the ABCL were as follows:[38], 876809=image: http://www.wnd.com/files/2015/06/Gallup_2015b.jpg, 701434=In 1911, after a fire destroyed their home in Hastings-on-Hudson, the Sangers abandoned the suburbs for a new life in New York City. Margaret Sanger worked as a visiting nurse in the slums of the East Side, while her husband worked as an architect and a house painter. Already imbued with her husband\u2019s leftist politics, Margaret Sanger also threw herself into the radical politics and modernist values of pre-World War I Greenwich Village bohemia. She joined the Women\u2019s Committee of the New York Socialist party, took part in the labor actions of the Industrial Workers of the World (including the notable 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike and the 1913 Paterson Silk Strike) and became involved with local intellectuals, left-wing artists, socialists and social activists, including John Reed, Upton Sinclair, Mabel Dodge and Emma Goldman.[8], 174804=More is known about Conrad\u2019s other, more open flirtation. An old friend, Captain Gabriel Renouf of the French merchant marine, introduced him to the family of his brother-in-law. Renouf\u2019s eldest sister was the wife of Louis Edward Schmidt, a senior official in the colony; with them lived two other sisters and two brothers. Though the island had been taken over in 1810 by Britain, many of the inhabitants were descendants of the original French colonists, and Conrad\u2019s excellent French and perfect manners opened all local salons to him. He became a frequent guest at the Schmidts\u2019, where he often met the Misses Renouf. A couple of days before leaving Port Louis, Conrad asked one of the Renouf brothers for the hand of his 26-year-old sister Eugenie. She was already, however, engaged to marry her pharmacist cousin. After the rebuff, Conrad did not pay a farewell visit but sent a polite letter to Gabriel Renouf, saying he would never return to Mauritius and adding that on the day of the wedding his thoughts would be with them., 201265=An October 1923 visitor to Oswalds, Conrad\u2019s home at the time\u00a0\u2013 Cyril Clemens, a cousin of Mark Twain\u00a0\u2013 quoted Conrad as saying: \u201cIn everything I have written there is always one invariable intention, and that is to capture the reader\u2019s attention.\u201d[2]:564, 501935=The third type of executive agreement is one adopted by the President without explicit approval of either the Senate or the Congress as a whole. The Supreme Court and modern practice embrace the idea that the President may under some circumstances make these so-called sole executive agreements. United States v. Belmont (1937); United States v. Pink (1942). But the scope of this independent presidential power remains a serious question. The Pink and Belmont cases involved agreements relating to the recognition of a foreign government, a power closely tied to the President\u2019s textual power to receive ambassadors (Article II, Section 3). The courts have consistently permitted the President to settle foreign claims by sole executive agreement, but at the same time have emphasized that the Congress has acquiesced in the practice. Dames & Moore v. Regan (1981);American Insurance Ass\u2019n v. Garamendi (2003). Beyond this, the modern limits of the President\u2019s ability to act independently in making international agreements have not been explored. With respect to treaty termination, modern practice allows the President to terminate treaties on his own. In recent times, President James Earl Carter terminated the U.S.\u2013Taiwan Mutual Defense Treaty in 1977, and President George W. Bush terminated the ABM Treaty with Russia in 2001. The Senate objected sharply to President Carter\u2019s actions, but the Supreme Court rebuffed the Senate in Goldwater v. Carter (1979). President Bush\u2019s action was criticized in some academic quarters but received general acquiescence. In light of the consensus early in Washington\u2019s administration, it is probably fair to say that presidential termination does not obviously depart from the original understanding, inasmuch as the Framers were much more concerned about checks upon entering into treaties than they were about checks upon terminating them., 182326=Zag\u00f3rska introduced Conrad to Polish writers, intellectuals and artists who had also taken refuge in Zakopane, including novelist Stefan \u017beromski and Tadeusz Nalepi\u0144ski, a writer friend of anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski. Conrad roused interest among the Poles as a famous writer and an exotic compatriot from abroad. He charmed new acquaintances, especially women. However, the double Nobel laureate Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie\u2018s physician sister, Bronis\u0142awa D\u0142uska, scolded him for having used his great talent for purposes other than bettering the future of his native land[2]:463\u201364[note 16] But thirty-three-year-old Aniela Zag\u00f3rska (daughter of the pension keeper), Conrad\u2019s niece who would translate his works into Polish in 1923\u201339, idolised him, kept him company, and provided him with books. He particularly delighted in the stories and novels of the ten-years-older, recently deceased Boles\u0142aw Prus,[2]:463[26] read everything by his fellow victim of Poland\u2019s 1863 Uprising\u00a0\u2013 \u201cmy beloved Prus\u201d\u00a0\u2013 that he could get his hands on, and pronounced him \u201cbetter than Dickens\u201d\u00a0\u2013 a favourite English novelist of Conrad\u2019s.[27][note 17], 237559=In a letter of late December 1897 to Cunninghame Graham, Conrad metaphorically described the universe as a huge machine:, 193528=Conrad\u2019s alienation from partisan politics went together with an abiding sense of the thinking man\u2019s burden imposed by his personality, as described in an 1894 letter of Conrad\u2019s to a relative-by-marriage and fellow author, Marguerite Poradowska (n\u00e9e Gachet, and cousin of Vincent van Gogh\u2018s physician, Paul Gachet) of Brussels:, 1034970=The average tariff rate is 1.5 percent. Tariffs on clothing are high, sugar imports face tariff-rate quotas, and petroleum and liquefied natural gas exports are restricted. Foreign investment in some sectors is capped. The financial market is well developed, but the 2010 Dodd\u2013Frank Act has instituted more federal regulation, socializing the cost of financial risk-taking and increasing the likelihood of future financial crises and bailouts, 69056=In the summer of 1902 Frank Ashton, an educated young man from London, is on a walking holiday in Devon with a friend. When he falls and twists his ankle, Ashton is helped at a nearby farmhouse and stays there for a few days to recover, while his friend goes on. Ashton quickly falls for the village girl who looks after him, Megan David, and she falls in love with him, to the great distress of her cousin Joe Narracombe, who wants her for himself. Ashton and Megan spend a night together, and after that he takes the train to a seaside town to cash a cheque at a bank, promising to return the next morning and take Megan away with him and marry her., 744659=Sanger\u2019s 1920 book endorsed eugenics., 290135=Russell\u2019s insights, so resonant with Morrell\u2019s, reveal the profundity of Conrad\u2019s existential loneliness. Russell\u2019s Autobiography, published over half a century later in 1968, vividly confirms his original experience:, 686285=On December 31, 2012, Judge Gary Harger ruled Texas may exclude otherwise qualified doctors and clinics from receiving state funding if they advocate for abortion rights.[116], 878460=While Americans are more confident in the economy than they were from 2008 to 2013, the Gallup spokesman said, \u201c[T]hey are not yet convinced that the economy is good, given that their assessments\u00a0of national economic conditions remain more negative than positive.\u201d, 739732=While researching information on contraception Sanger read various treatises on sexuality in order to find information about birth control. She read The Psychology of Sex by the English psychologist Havelock Ellis and was heavily influenced by it.[74] While traveling in Europe in 1914, Sanger met Ellis.[75] Influenced by Ellis, Sanger adopted his view of sexuality as a powerful, liberating force.[76] This view provided another argument in favor of birth control, as it would enable women to fully enjoy sexual relations without the fear of an unwanted pregnancy.[77] Sanger also believed that sexuality, along with birth control, should be discussed with more candor.[76], 345988=If, for example, you are Laurence Tribe in 1984, Harvard professor of law, leftist pillar of the establishment, you can \u201cwrite\u201d your magnum opus by using the products of your student assistant, Ron Klain. A decade later, after Klain admits to having written some parts of the book, and the other parts are found to be verbatim or paraphrases of a book published in 1974, you can claim (perhaps correctly) that your plagiarism was \u201cinadvertent,\u201d and you can count on the Law School\u2019s dean, Elena Kagan, to appoint a committee including former and future Harvard president Derek Bok that issues a secret report that \u201ccloses\u201d the incident. Incidentally, Kagan ends up a justice of the Supreme Court. Not one of these people did their jobs: the professor did not write the book himself, the assistant plagiarized instead of researching, the dean and the committee did not hold the professor accountable, and all ended up rewarded. By contrast, for example, learned papers and distinguished careers in climatology at MIT (Richard Lindzen) or UVA (S. Fred Singer) are not enough for their questions about \u201cglobal warming\u201d to be taken seriously. For our ruling class, identity always trumps., 855350=Congress is the institution in which Americans express the least confidence this year, with 8% doing so, one point above its 7% rating last year \u2014 the lowest Gallup has ever measured for any institution. Congress has ranked last each year since 2010, and a total of 12 times since 1973. Other institutions that have held this unwelcome distinction in the past include big business (nine times), health maintenance organizations (eight), the criminal justice system (six) and organized labor (four). The top- and bottom-rated institutions in each Confidence in Institutions poll are shown at the bottom of this story., 369180=Thus in 2009-10 the American Medical Association (AMA) strongly supported the new medical care law, which the administration touted as having the support of \u201cthe doctors\u201d even though the vast majority of America\u2019s 975,000 physicians opposed it. Those who run the AMA, however, have a government contract as exclusive providers of the codes by which physicians and hospitals bill the government for their services. The millions of dollars that flow thereby to the AMA\u2019s officers keep them in line, while the impracticality of doing without the billing codes tamps down rebellion in the doctor ranks. When the administration wanted to bolster its case that the state of Arizona\u2019s enforcement of federal immigration laws was offensive to Hispanics, the National Association of Chiefs of Police \u2014 whose officials depend on the administration for their salaries \u2014 issued a statement that the laws would endanger all Americans by raising Hispanics\u2019 animosity. This reflected conversations with the administration rather than a vote of the nation\u2019s police chiefs., 693745=Margaret Higgins Sanger (September 14, 1879 \u2013 September 6, 1966) was an American birth control activist, sex educator, and nurse. Sanger popularized the term birth control, opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, and established organizations that evolved into the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Sanger was also a writer. She used this method to help promote her way of thinking. She was prosecuted for her book Family Limitation under the Comstock Act in 1914. She was afraid of what would happen, so she fled to Britain until she knew it was safe to return to the US.[citation needed] Sanger\u2019s efforts contributed to several judicial cases that helped legalize contraception in the United States. Sanger is a frequent target of criticism by opponents of abortion and has also been criticized for supporting eugenics, but remains an iconic figure in the American reproductive rights movement.[2], 736296=Sanger has been recognized with many important honors. In 1957, the American Humanist Association named her Humanist of the Year. Government authorities and other institutions have memorialized Sanger by dedicating several landmarks in her name, including a residential building on the Stony Brook University campus, a room in Wellesley College\u2019s library,[68] and Margaret Sanger Square in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village.[69] In 1993, the Margaret Sanger Clinic\u2014where she provided birth control services in New York in the mid twentieth century\u2014was designated as a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service.[70] In 1966, Planned Parenthood began issuing its Margaret Sanger Awards annually to honor \u201cindividuals of distinction in recognition of excellence and leadership in furthering reproductive health and reproductive rights.\u201d[71], 351239=Thus began the Progressive Era. When Woodrow Wilson in 1914 was asked \u201ccan\u2019t you let anything alone?\u201d he answered with, \u201cI let everything alone that you can show me is not itself moving in the wrong direction, but I am not going to let those things alone that I see are going down-hill.\u201d Wilson spoke for the thousands of well-off Americans who patronized the spas at places like Chautauqua and Lake Mohonk. By such upper-middle-class waters, progressives who imagined themselves the world\u2019s examples and the world\u2019s reformers dreamt big dreams of establishing order, justice, and peace at home and abroad. Neither were they shy about their desire for power. Wilson was the first American statesman to argue that the Founders had done badly by depriving the U.S. government of the power to reshape American society. Nor was Wilson the last to invade a foreign country (Mexico) to \u201cteach [them] to elect good men.\u201d, 195882=On 3 August 1924, Conrad died at his house, Oswalds, in Bishopsbourne, Kent, England, probably of a heart attack. He was interred at Canterbury Cemetery, Canterbury, under a misspelled version of his original Polish name, as \u201cJoseph Teador Conrad Korzeniowski\u201d.[2]:573 Inscribed on his gravestone are the lines from Edmund Spenser\u2018s The Faerie Queene which he had chosen as the epigraph to his last complete novel, The Rover:, 848130=Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted June 1-7, 2015, on the Gallup U.S. Daily survey, with a random sample of 3,035 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is \u00b12 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting., 699948=Supported by her two older sisters, Margaret Higgins attended Claverack College and Hudson River Institute, before enrolling in 1900 at White Plains Hospital as a nurse probationer. In 1902, she married the dashing architect William Sanger and gave up her education.[7] Though she was plagued by a recurring active tubercular condition, Margaret Sanger bore three children, and the couple settled down to a quiet life in Westchester, New York., 685589=In Indiana, Planned Parenthood was not required to turn over its medical records in an investigation of possible child abuse.[114] In October 2005, Planned Parenthood Minnesota/North Dakota/South Dakota was fined $50,000 for violating a Minnesota state parental consent law.[115], 851408=These results are based on a June 2-7 Gallup poll that included Gallup\u2019s latest update on confidence in U.S. institutions.

Verloc is also a businessman who owns a shop which sells pornographic material, contraceptives, and bric-a-brac. He lives with his wife Winnie, his mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law, Stevie. Stevie has a mental disability, possibly autism,[5] which causes him to be very excitable; his sister, Verloc\u2019s wife, attends to him, treating him more as a son than as a brother. Verloc\u2019s friends are a group of anarchists of which Comrade Ossipon, Michaelis, and \u201cThe Professor\u201d are the most prominent. Although largely ineffectual as terrorists, their actions are known to the police. The group produce anarchist literature in the form of pamphlets entitled F.P., an acronym for The Future of the Proletariat., 207841=Apart from Conrad\u2019s own experiences, a number of episodes in his fiction were suggested by past or contemporary publicly known events or literary works. The first half of the 1900 novel Lord Jim (the \u2018Patna\u2019 episode) was inspired by the real-life 1880 story of theSS\u00a0Jeddah;[10]:96\u20137 the second part, to some extent by the life of James Brooke, the first White Rajah of Sarawak.[31] The 1901 short story \u201cAmy Foster\u201d was inspired partly by an anecdote in Ford Madox Ford\u2018s The Cinque Ports (1900), wherein a shipwrecked sailor from a German merchant ship, unable to communicate in English, and driven away by the local country people, finally found shelter in a pigsty.[2]:312\u201313 [note 20] In Nostromo (completed 1904), the theft of a massive consignment of silver was suggested to Conrad by a story he had heard in the Gulf of Mexico and later read about in a \u201cvolume picked up outside a second-hand bookshop.\u201d[10]:128\u201329 [note 21] The Secret Agent (completed 1906) was inspired by the French anarchist Martial Bourdin\u2018s 1894 death while apparently attempting to blow up the Greenwich Observatory.[32] Conrad\u2019s story \u201cThe Secret Sharer\u201d (completed 1909) was inspired by an 1880 incident when Sydney Smith, first mate of the Cutty Sark, had killed a seaman and fled from justice, aided by the ship\u2019s captain.[10]:235\u20136 The plot of Under Western Eyes (completed 1910) is kicked off by the assassination of a brutal Russian government minister, modelled after the real-life 1904 assassination of Russian Minister of the Interior Vyacheslav von Plehve.[10]:199 The near-novella \u201cFreya of the Seven Isles\u201d (completed in March 1911) was inspired by a story told to Conrad by a Malaya old hand and fan of Conrad\u2019s, Captain Carlos M. Marris.[2]:405, 422\u201323, 640102=On February 15, 2006, Cecile Richards became president of the organization.[24], 863597=Americans\u2019 confidence in two of the three institutions that make up the U.S. government \u2014 Congress and the Supreme Court \u2014 remains near their all-time lows reached in 2014, while confidence in the presidency, although low, is up marginally compared with last year., 294426=Conrad\u2019s sense of loneliness throughout his exile\u2019s life found memorable expression in the 1901 short story, \u201cAmy Foster\u201c., 853989=The large decline in confidence in organized religion is likely tied to a decline in religiosity overall, but also to scandals that have plagued various religious organizations, most notably the Catholic Church. This year\u2019s 42% score for confidence in the church or organized religion is the lowest Gallup has measured for that institution. The prior low was 44% in 2012., 467790=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/UN_UNITED_NATIONS_IRAN_NUCLEAR_DEAL?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2015-07-20-12-04-13, 82372=The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale is a novel by Joseph Conrad, published in 1907.[1] The story is set in London in 1886 and deals with Mr. Verloc and his work as a spy for an unnamed country (presumably Russia).The Secret Agent is notable for being one of Conrad\u2019s later political novels. In these later novels, Conrad has moved away from his former tales of seafaring., 4213=Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a 1974 spy novel by British author John le Carr\u00e9. The first novel in le Carr\u00e9\u2019s Karla Trilogy, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy features the efforts of taciturn, aging spymaster George Smiley to uncover a Soviet mole in the \u201cCircus\u201d, an analogue to the British Secret Intelligence Service. Since the time of its publication, the novel has received critical acclaim for its complexity, social commentary and lack of sensationalism,[2] and remains a staple of the spy fiction genre.[3], 862528=The highest confidence rating the presidency has ever received is 72%, in March 1991 during the administration of George H.W. Bush shortly after he had succeeded in pushing Iraq out of Kuwait in the Gulf War. However, by October of that same year, after the Gulf War was over, confidence in the presidency had dropped to 50%., 36513=In 1988, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a dramatisation, by Rene Basilico, of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy in seven weekly half-hour episodes, produced by John Fawcett-Wilson. It is available as a BBC audiobook in CD and audio cassette formats. Notably, Bernard Heptonportrays George Smiley. Nine years earlier, he had portrayed Toby Esterhase in the television adaptation., 37218=In 2009, BBC Radio 4 also broadcast new dramatisations, by Shaun McKenna, of the eight George Smiley novels by John le Carr\u00e9, featuring Simon Russell Beale as Smiley. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was broadcast as three, one-hour episodes, from Sunday 29 November to Sunday 13 December 2009 in BBC Radio 4\u2019s Classic Serial slot. The producer was Steven Canny.[8], 215404=In keeping with his scepticism[7]:166[10]:163 and melancholy,[10]:16, 18 Conrad almost invariably gives lethal fates to the characters in his principal novels and stories. Almayer (Almayer\u2019s Folly, 1894), abandoned by his beloved daughter, takes to opium, and dies;[10]:42Peter Willems (An Outcast of the Islands, 1895) is killed by his jealous lover A\u00efssa;[10]:48 the ineffectual \u201cNigger,\u201d James Wait (The Nigger of the \u2018Narcissus\u2019, 1897), dies aboard ship and is buried at sea;[10]:68\u20139 Mr. Kurtz (Heart of Darkness, 1899) expires, uttering the enigmatic words, \u201cThe horror!\u201d;[10]:68\u20139 Tuan Jim (Lord Jim, 1900), having inadvertently precipitated a massacre of his adoptive community, deliberately walks to his death at the hands of the community\u2019s leader;[10]:97 in Conrad\u2019s 1901 short story, \u201cAmy Foster\u201c, a Pole transplanted to England, Yanko Goorall (an English transliteration of the Polish Janko G\u00f3ral, \u201cJohnny Highlander\u201d), falls ill and, suffering from a fever, raves in his native language, frightening his wife Amy, who flees; next morning Yanko dies of heart failure, and it transpires that he had simply been asking in Polish for water;[note 23] Captain Whalley (The End of the Tether, 1902), betrayed by failing eyesight and an unscrupulous partner, drowns himself;[10]:91 Gian\u2019 Battista Fidanza,[note 24] the eponymous respected Italian-immigrant Nostromo (Italian: \u201cOur Man\u201d) of the novel Nostromo (1904), illicitly obtains a treasure of silver mined in the South American country of \u201cCostaguana\u201d and is shot dead due to mistaken identity;[10]:124\u201326 Mr. Verloc, The Secret Agent (1906) of divided loyalties, attempts a bombing, to be blamed on terrorists, that accidentally kills his mentally defective brother-in-law Stevie, and Verloc himself is killed by his distraught wife, who drowns herself by jumping overboard from a channel steamer;[10]:166\u201368 in Chance(1913), Roderick Anthony, a sailing-ship captain, and benefactor and husband of Flora de Barral, becomes the target of a poisoning attempt by her jealous disgraced financier father who, when detected, swallows the poison himself and dies (some years later, Captain Anthony drowns at sea);[10]:209\u201311 in Victory (1915), Lena is shot dead by Jones, who had meant to kill his accomplice Ricardo and later succeeds in doing so, then himself perishes along with another accomplice, after which Lena\u2019s protector Axel Heyst sets fire to his bungalow and dies beside Lena\u2019s body.[10]:220, 487230=http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/28/alexander-hamiltons-warning-against-obama-and-the-iran-deal/, 733042=Sanger died of congestive heart failure in 1966 in Tucson, Arizona, aged 86, about a year after the event that marked the climax of her 50-year career: the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Griswold v. Connecticut, which legalized birth control in the United States.[note 6] Sanger is buried in Fishkill, New York, next to her sister, Nan Higgins, and her second husband, Noah Slee.[63] One of her surviving brothers was College Football Hall of Fame player and coach Bob Higgins.[64], 271185=In 1919 and 1922 Conrad\u2019s growing renown and prestige among writers and critics in continental Europe fostered his hopes for a Nobel Prize in Literature. Interestingly, it was apparently the French and Swedes \u2013 not the English \u2013 who favoured Conrad\u2019s candidacy.[2]:512, 550 [note 31], 170465=Conrad suffered throughout life from ill health, physical and mental. A newspaper review of a Conrad biography suggested that the book could have been subtitled Thirty Years of Debt, Gout, Depression and Angst.[17] In 1891 he was hospitalised for several months, suffering from gout, neuralgic pains in his right arm and recurrent attacks of malaria. He also complained of swollen hands \u201cwhich made writing difficult\u201d. Taking his uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski\u2019s advice, he convalesced at a spa in Switzerland.[2]:169\u201370 Conrad had a phobia of dentistry, neglecting his teeth till they had to be extracted. In one letter he remarked that every novel he had written had cost him a tooth.[7]:258 Conrad\u2019s physical afflictions were, if anything, less vexatious than his mental ones. In his letters he often described symptoms of depression; \u201cthe evidence,\u201d writes Najder, \u201cis so strong that it is nearly impossible to doubt it.\u201d[2]:167, 760666=Historian Rodger Streitmatter concluded that Sanger\u2019s opposition to abortion stemmed from concerns for the dangers to the mother, rather than moral concerns.[112] However, in her 1938 autobiography, Sanger noted that her opposition to abortion was based on the taking of life: \u201c[In 1916] we explained what contraception was; that abortion was the wrong way no matter how early it was performed it was taking life; that contraception was the better way, the safer way\u2014it took a little time, a little trouble, but was well worth while in the long run, because life had not yet begun.\u201d[113] And in her book Family Limitation, Sanger wrote that \u201cno one can doubt that there are times when an abortion is justifiable but they will become unnecessary when care is taken to prevent conception. This is the only cure for abortions.\u201d[114], 364805=The 2010 medical law is a template for the ruling class\u2019s economic modus operandi: the government taxes citizens to pay for medical care and requires citizens to purchase health insurance. The money thus taken and directed is money that the citizens themselves might have used to pay for medical care. In exchange for the money, the government promises to provide care through its \u201csystem.\u201d But then all the boards, commissions, guidelines, procedures, and \u201cbest practices\u201d that constitute \u201cthe system\u201d become the arbiters of what any citizen ends up getting. The citizen might end up dissatisfied with what \u201cthe system\u201d offers. But when he gave up his money, he gave up the power to choose, and became dependent on all the boards and commissions that his money also pays for and that raise the cost of care. Similarly, in 2008 the House Ways and Means Committee began considering a plan to force citizens who own Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) to transfer those funds into government-run \u201cguaranteed retirement accounts.\u201d If the government may force citizens to buy health insurance, by what logic can it not force them to trade private ownership and control of retirement money for a guarantee as sound as the government itself? Is it not clear that the government knows more about managing retirement income than individuals?, 175857=In March 1896 Conrad married an Englishwoman, Jessie George.[20] The couple had two sons, Borys and John. The elder, Borys, proved a disappointment in scholarship and integrity.[2] Jessie was an unsophisticated, working-class girl, sixteen years younger than Conrad. To his friends, she was an inexplicable choice of wife, and the subject of some rather disparaging and unkind remarks.[21][22] (See Lady Ottoline Morrell\u2019s opinion of Jessie in Impressions.) However, according to other biographers such as Frederick Karl, Jessie provided what Conrad needed, namely a \u201cstraightforward, devoted, quite competent\u201d companion.[23] Similarly, Jones remarks that, despite whatever difficulties the marriage endured, \u201cthere can be no doubt that the relationship sustained Conrad\u2019s career as a writer\u201d, which might have been a lot less successful without her.[24], 148466=In a letter of 9 August 1877, Conrad\u2019s uncle Bobrowski broached two important subjects:[note 7] the desirability of Conrad\u2019s naturalisation abroad (tantamount to release from being a Russian subject) and Conrad\u2019s plans to join the British merchant marine. \u201c[D]o you speak English?\u2026 I never wished you to become naturalized in France, mainly because of the compulsory military service\u2026 I thought, however, of your getting naturalized in Switzerland\u2026\u201d In his next letter, Bobrowski supported Conrad\u2019s idea of seeking citizenship of the United States or of \u201cone of the more important Southern Republics\u201d.[2]:57\u201358, 361599=By making economic rules dependent on discretion, our bipartisan ruling class teaches that prosperity is to be bought with the coin of political support. Thus in the 1990s and 2000s, as Democrats and Republicans forced banks to make loans for houses to people and at rates they would not otherwise have considered, builders and investors had every reason to make as much money as they could from the ensuing inflation of housing prices. When the bubble burst, only those connected with the ruling class at the bottom and at the top were bailed out. Similarly, by taxing the use of carbon fuels and subsidizing \u201calternative energy,\u201d our ruling class created arguably the world\u2019s biggest opportunity for making money out of things that few if any would buy absent its intervention. The ethanol industry and its ensuing diversions of wealth exist exclusively because of subsidies. The prospect of legislation that would put a price on carbon emissions and allot certain amounts to certain companies set off a feeding frenzy among large companies to show support for a \u201cgreen agenda,\u201d because such allotments would be worth tens of billions of dollars. That is why companies hired some 2,500 lobbyists in 2009 to deepen their involvement in \u201cclimate change.\u201d At the very least, such involvement profits them by making them into privileged collectors of carbon taxes. Any \u201cgreen jobs\u201d thus created are by definition creatures of subsidies \u2014 that is, of privilege. What effect creating such privileges may have on \u201cglobal warming\u201d is debatable. But it surely increases the number of people dependent on the ruling class, and teaches Americans that satisfying that class is a surer way of making a living than producing goods and services that people want to buy., 389589=Members of the country class who want to rise in their profession through sheer competence try at once to avoid the ruling class\u2019s rituals while guarding against infringing its prejudices. Averse to wheedling, they tend to think that exams should play a major role in getting or advancing in jobs, that records of performance \u2014 including academic ones \u2014 should be matters of public record, and that professional disputes should be settled by open argument. For such people, the Supreme Court\u2019s 2009 decision in Ricci, upholding the right of firefighters to be promoted according to the results of a professional exam, revived the hope that competence may sometimes still trump political connections., 799473=Saul Bellow (10 June 1915 \u2013 5 April 2005) was a Canadian-born American writer. For his literary contributions, Bellow was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, the Nobel Prize for Literature, and the National Medal of Arts. He is the only writer to win the National Book Award for Fiction three times and he received the Foundation\u2019s lifetime Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1990. In the words of the Swedish Nobel Committee, his writing exhibited \u201cthe mixture of rich picaresque novel and subtle analysis of our culture, of entertaining adventure, drastic and tragic episodes in quick succession interspersed with philosophic conversation, all developed by a commentator with a witty tongue and penetrating insight into the outer and inner complications that drive us to act, or prevent us from acting, and that can be called the dilemma of our age.\u201d His best-known works include The Adventures of Augie March, Henderson the Rain King, Herzog, Mr. Sammler\u2019s Planet, Seize the Day, Humboldt\u2019s Gift and Ravelstein. Widely regarded as one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest authors, Bellow has had a \u201chuge literary influence.\u201d, 673024=Planned Parenthood is the largest single provider of abortions in the U.S.[7] In 2009, Planned Parenthood performed 332,278 abortions (for comparison, 1.21 million abortions were performed in the US in 2008[87]), from which it derives about $164,154,000, or 15% of its annual revenue as of their 2008\u20132009 calculations.[88] According to PPFA\u2019s own estimates, its contraceptive services prevent approximately 612,000 unintended pregnancies and 291,000 abortions annually.[37][89] Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards has argued that the organization\u2019s family planning services reduce the need for abortions.[90] Megan Crepeau of the Chicago Tribune said that, because of its birth control and family planning services, PPFA could be \u201ccharacterized as America\u2019s largest abortion preventer.\u201d[91] Anti-abortion activists dispute the evidence that greater access to contraceptives reduces abortions.[92], 267358=In April 2013, a monument to Conrad was unveiled in the Russian town of Vologda, where he and his parents lived in exile in 1862\u201363., 844863=WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Gallup\u2019s U.S. Economic Confidence Index registered at -9 for the week ending June 7, the sixth straight week the index has been at or below -5., 250363=The impracticality of working with a language which has long ceased to be one\u2019s principal language of daily use is illustrated by Conrad\u2019s 1921 attempt at translating into English the Polish columnist and comedy-writer Bruno Winawer\u2018s short play, The Book of Job. Najder writes:, 568418=A real time recreation of the 1942 Wannsee Conference, in which leading SS and Nazi Party officials led by SS-General Reinhard Heydrich gathered to discuss the \u201cFinal Solution to the Jewish Question\u201d., 590331=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/07/16/planned-parenthood-head-apologizes-for-tone-of-doctor-in-covert-video/, 292424=Conrad looked with less optimism than Russell on the possibilities of scientific and philosophic knowledge.[2]:449 In a 1913 letter to acquaintances who had invited Conrad to join their society, he reiterated his belief that it was impossible to understand the essence of either reality or life: both science and art penetrate no further than the outer shapes.[2]:446, 734770=Long after her death, Sanger has continued to be regarded as a leading figure in the battle for American women\u2019s rights. Sanger\u2019s story has been the subject of several biographies, including an award-winning biography published in 1970 by David Kennedy, and is also the subject of several films, including Choices of the Heart: The Margaret Sanger Story.[65] Sanger\u2019s writings are curated by two universities: New York University\u2018s history department maintains the Margaret Sanger Papers Project,[66] and Smith College\u2018s Sophia Smith Collection maintains the Margaret Sanger Papers collection.[67], 35384=In 1979 a TV adaptation of the same name was made by the BBC. It was a seven-part miniseries and was released in September of that year. The series was directed by John Irvin, produced by Jonathan Powell, and starred Alec Guinness as George Smiley., 846937=Americans\u2019 outlook has improved on a variety of economic measures, but their overall confidence in the U.S. economy is registering significantly lower values in the past several weeks than it did from late December to late April., 272653=In April 1924 Conrad, who possessed a hereditary Polish status of nobility and coat-of-arms (Na\u0142\u0119cz), declined a (non-hereditary) British knighthood offered by Labour Party Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.[note 32] [note 33] Conrad kept a distance from official structures \u2014 he never voted in British national elections \u2014 and seems to have been averse to public honours generally; he had already refused honorary degrees from Cambridge, Durham, Edinburgh, Liverpool, and Yale universities.[2]:570, 612054=Richards previously founded and served as president of America Votes, a coalition of national Democratic Party-affiliated organizations.[4] Before that, she was deputy chief of staff to the U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Leader in the U.S. House of Representatives.[5] She has also worked at the Turner Foundation.[6] In 1996, she founded the Texas Freedom Network, a Texas organization formed to counter the Christian right.[7], 863164=But the average of confidence ratings for the three branches of government has been lower \u2014 including in 2008 (23%) and 2014 (22%)., 869358=All in all, it\u2019s a picture of a nation discouraged about its present and worried about its future, and highly doubtful that its institutions can pull America out of its trough. In a political context, the findings indicate that the growing number of presidential candidates for 2016 will have a difficult time instilling confidence in a skeptical electorate that they have the answers to the country\u2019s problems., 869785=\u201cAmericans\u2019 confidence in most major institutions has been down for many years as the nation has dealt with prolonged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a major recession and sluggish economic improvement,\u00a0and partisan gridlock in Washington,\u201d the Gallup spokesman said. \u201cIn fact, 2004 was the last year most institutions were at or above their historical average levels of confidence. Perhaps not coincidentally, 2004 was also the last year Americans\u2019 satisfaction with the way things are going in the United States averaged better than 40 percent. Currently, 28 percent of Americans are satisfied with the state of the nation.\u201d, 681386=In 2011, the organization Live Action released a series of videos that they said showed Planned Parenthood employees at multiple affiliates actively assisting or being complicit in aiding the underage prostitution ring of actors posing as a pimp and a prostitute. Planned Parenthood conducted a frame-by-frame analysis of the recordings, and said they found instances of \u201cediting that dramatically alter[ed] the meaning of the recorded conversations.\u201d[108], 135006=Because of the father\u2019s attempts at farming and his political activism, the family moved repeatedly. In May 1861 they moved to Warsaw, where Apollo joined the resistance against the Russian Empire. This led to his imprisonment in Pavilion X (Ten) of the Warsaw Citadel.[note 5] Conrad would write: \u201c[I]n the courtyard of this Citadel\u00a0\u2013 characteristically for our nation\u00a0\u2013 my childhood memories begin.\u201d[2]:17\u201319 On 9 May 1862 Apollo and his family were exiled to Vologda, 500 kilometres (310\u00a0mi) north of Moscow and known for its bad climate.[2]:19\u201320 In January 1863 Apollo\u2019s sentence was commuted, and the family was sent to Chernihiv in northeast Ukraine, where conditions were much better. However, on 18 April 1865 Ewa died of tuberculosis.[2]:19\u201325, 244578=More to the point is Conrad\u2019s remark in A Personal Record that English was \u201cthe speech of my secret choice, of my future, of long friendships, of the deepest affections, of hours of toil and hours of ease, and of solitary hours, too, of books read, of thoughts pursued, of remembered emotions\u2014of my very dreams!\u201d[38]:252 In 1878 Conrad\u2019s four-year experience in the French merchant marine had been cut short when the French discovered that he did not have a permit from the Imperial Russian consul to sail with the French.[note 28] This, and some typically disastrous Conradian investments, had left him destitute and had precipitated a suicide attempt. With the concurrence of his uncle Bobrowski, who had been summoned to Marseilles, Conrad decided to seek employment with the British merchant marine, which did not require Russia\u2019s permission.[2]:64\u201366 Thus began Conrad\u2019s sixteen years\u2019 seafarer\u2019s acquaintance with the British and with the English language., 714394=On October 16, 1916, Sanger opened a family planning and birth control clinic at 46 Amboy St. in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, the first of its kind in the United States.[26] Nine days after the clinic opened, Sanger was arrested. Sanger\u2019s bail was set at $500 and she went back home. Sanger continued seeing some women in the clinic until the police came a second time. This time Sanger and her sister, Ethel Byrne, were arrested for breaking a New York state law that prohibited distribution of contraceptives, Sanger was also charged with running a public nuisance.[27] Sanger and Ethel went to trial in January 1917.[28] Byrne was convicted and sentenced to 30 days in a workhouse but went on hunger strike. She was the first woman in the US to be force fed.[29] Only when Sanger pledged that Byrne would never break the law, she was pardoned after ten days.[30] Sanger was convicted; the trial judge held that women did not have \u201cthe right to copulate with a feeling of security that there will be no resulting conception.\u201d[31] Sanger was offered a more lenient sentence if she promised to not break the law again, but she replied: \u201cI cannot respect the law as it exists today.\u201d[32] For this, she was sentenced to 30 days in a workhouse.[32] An initial appeal was rejected, but in a subsequent court proceeding in 1918, the birth control movement won a victory when Judge Frederick E. Crane of the New York Court of Appeals issued a ruling which allowed doctors to prescribe contraception.[33] The publicity surrounding Sanger\u2019s arrest, trial, and appeal sparked birth control activism across the United States, and earned the support of numerous donors, who would provide her with funding and support for future endeavors.[34], 727686=In 1929, Sanger formed the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control in order to lobby for legislation to overturn restrictions on contraception.[55] That effort failed to achieve success, so Sanger ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, in order to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the United States government, and Sanger\u2019s subsequent legal challenge led to a 1936 court decision which overturned an important provision of the Comstock laws which prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.[56] This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a key component of medical school curriculums.[57], 631378=The origins of Planned Parenthood date to October 16, 1916 when Margaret Sanger, her sister Ethel Byrne, and Fania Mindell opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S. in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York.[10] All three women were immediately arrested and jailed for violating provisions of the Comstock Act\u2013 for distributing \u201cobscene materials\u201d at the clinic. The \u201cBrownsville trials\u201d brought national attention and support to their cause, and although Sanger and her co-defendants were convicted, their convictions were eventually overturned. Their campaign led to major changes in the laws governing birth control and sex education in the United States.[11], 349756=It did not take long for their paradigm to be challenged by interest and by \u201cscience.\u201d By the 1820s, as J. C. Calhoun was reading in the best London journals that different breeds of animals and plants produce inferior or superior results, slave owners were citing the Negroes\u2019 deficiencies to argue that they should remain slaves indefinitely. Lots of others were reading Ludwig Feuerbach\u2019s rendition of Hegelian philosophy, according to which biblical injunctions reflect the fantasies of alienated human beings or, in the young Karl Marx\u2019s formulation, that ethical thought is \u201csuperstructural\u201d to material reality. By 1853, when Sen. John Pettit of Ohio called \u201call men are created equal\u201d \u201ca self-evident lie,\u201d much of America\u2019s educated class had already absorbed the \u201cscientific\u201d notion (which Darwin only popularized) that man is the product of chance mutation and natural selection of the fittest. Accordingly, by nature, superior men subdue inferior ones as they subdue lower beings or try to improve them as they please. Hence while it pleased the abolitionists to believe in freeing Negroes and improving them, it also pleased them to believe that Southerners had to be punished and reconstructed by force. As the 19th century ended, the educated class\u2019s religious fervor turned to social reform: they were sure that because man is a mere part of evolutionary nature, man could be improved, and that they, the most highly evolved of all, were the improvers., 188491=The most extensive and ambitious political statement that Conrad ever made was his 1905 essay, \u201cAutocracy and War\u201d, whose starting point was the Russo-Japanese War (he finished the article a month before the Battle of Tsushima Strait). The essay begins with a statement about Russia\u2019s incurable weakness and ends with warnings against Prussia, the dangerous aggressor in a future European war. For Russia he predicted a violent outburst in the near future, but Russia\u2019s lack of democratic traditions and the backwardness of her masses made it impossible for the revolution to have a salutary effect. Conrad regarded the formation of a representative government in Russia as unfeasible and foresaw a transition from autocracy to dictatorship. He saw western Europe as torn by antagonisms engendered by economic rivalry and commercial selfishness. In vain might a Russian revolution seek advice or help from a materialistic and egoistic western Europe that armed itself in preparation for wars far more brutal than those of the past.[2]:351\u201354, 852332=From a broad perspective, Americans\u2019 confidence in all institutions over the last two years has been the lowest since Gallup began systematic updates of a larger set of institutions in 1993. The average confidence rating of the 14 institutions asked about annually since 1993 \u2014 excluding small business, asked annually since 2007 \u2014 is 32% this year. This is one percentage point above the all-institution average of 31% last year. Americans were generally more confident in all institutions in the late 1990s and early 2000s as the country enjoyed a strong economy and a rally in support for U.S. institutions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks., 149370=Eventually Conrad would make his home in England. On 2 July 1886 he applied for British nationality, which was granted on 19 August 1886. Yet, in spite of having become a subject of Queen Victoria, Conrad had not ceased to be a subject of Tsar Alexander III. To achieve the latter, he had to make many visits to the Russian Embassy in London and politely reiterate his request. He would later recall the Embassy\u2019s home at Belgrave Square in his novel The Secret Agent.[2]:112 Finally, on 2 April 1889, the Russian Ministry of Home Affairs released \u201cthe son of a Polish man of letters, captain of the British merchant marine\u201d from the status of Russian subject.[2]:132, 33411=The character Bill Haydon is partly derived from Kim Philby, a senior SIS officer who defected to the USSR in 1963. David Cornwell (John le Carr\u00e9), who worked as an intelligence officer for both MI5 and the SIS (MI6), has said that Philby betrayed his identity to the Russians, which was a factor in the 1964 termination of his intelligence career.[6][7], 857107=Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted June 2-7, 2015, with a random sample of 1,527 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is \u00b13 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting., 657800=Planned Parenthood and its predecessor organizations have provided and advocated for access to birth control. The modern organization of Planned Parenthood America is also an advocate for reproductive rights.[61] This advocacy includes contributing to sponsorship of abortion rights and women\u2019s rights events[62] and assisting in the testing of new contraceptives.[63] The Federation opposes restrictions on women\u2019s reproductive health services, including parental consent laws. Planned Parenthood has cited the case of Becky Bell, who died following a septic abortion after failing to seek parental consent, to justify their opposition.[64][65] Planned Parenthood also takes the position that laws requiring parental notification before an abortion is performed on a minor are unconstitutional on privacy grounds.[66] The organization also opposes laws requiring ultrasounds before abortions, stating that their only purpose is to make abortions more difficult to obtain.[67] Planned Parenthood has also opposed initiatives that require waiting periods before abortions,[68] and bans on late-term abortions including intact dilation and extraction, which has been illegal in the U.S. since 2003.[69], 856136=Americans continue to show lower levels of confidence in most of the major institutions central to U.S. society, with only the military and small business getting ratings in 2015 that are above their historical averages. That speaks to the broader dissatisfaction Americans have with the state of the nation more generally over the past decade as the U.S. has faced serious economic, international and political challenges. Americans have tended to be more confident in U.S. institutions when the economy has been strong, such as in the mid-1980s and the late 1990s and early 2000s. Although Americans are now more upbeat about the economy than they were in 2008-2013, they are not yet convinced that the economy is good, given that their assessments of national economic conditions remain more negative than positive., 138350=In December 1867, Apollo took his son to the Austrian-held part of Poland, which for two years had been enjoying considerable internal freedom and a degree of self-government. After sojourns in Lw\u00f3w and several smaller localities, on 20 February 1869 they moved to Krak\u00f3w (till 1596 the capital of Poland), likewise in Austrian Poland. A few months later, on 23 May 1869, Apollo Korzeniowski died, leaving Conrad orphaned at the age of eleven.[2]:31\u201334 Like Conrad\u2019s mother, Apollo had been gravely ill with tuberculosis., 142623=In August 1873 Bobrowski sent fifteen-year-old Conrad to Lw\u00f3w to a cousin who ran a small boarding house for boys orphaned by the 1863 Uprising; group conversation there was in French. The owner\u2019s daughter recalled:, 198916=In 1996 his grave became a Grade II listed building.[29], 640717=In 1966, PPFA began awarding the Margaret Sanger Award annually to honor, in their words, \u201cindividuals of distinction in recognition of excellence and leadership in furthering reproductive health and reproductive rights.\u201d In the first year, it was awarded to four men, Carl G. Hartman, William H. Draper, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and Martin Luther King.[25][26][27][28] Later recipients have included John D. Rockefeller III, Katharine Hepburn, Jane Fonda, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Ted Turner.[29][30][31], 847430=The recent erosion in confidence may be related to rising gas prices since the beginning of the year. The direction of gas prices in the months ahead could help predict the trajectory of economic confidence, as could other economic information consumers are likely to pick up on, including the monthly government jobs report \u2014 which for May was stronger than some analysts expected., 719111=Sanger published the Birth Control Review from 1917 to 1929.[note 4], 701236=Sanger with sons Grant and Stuart, c. 1919, 387811=Even when members of the country class happen to be government officials or officers of major corporations, their concerns are essentially private; in their view, government owes to its people equal treatment rather than action to correct what anyone perceives as imbalance or grievance. Hence they tend to oppose special treatment, whether for corporations or for social categories. Rather than gaming government regulations, they try to stay as far from them as possible. Thus the Supreme Court\u2019s 2005 decision in Kelo, which allows the private property of some to be taken by others with better connections to government, reminded the country class that government is not its friend., 172192=In March 1878, at the end of his Marseilles period, 20-year-old Conrad attempted suicide, by shooting himself in the chest with a revolver.[18] According to his uncle, who was summoned by a friend, Conrad had fallen into debt. Bobrowski described his subsequent \u201cstudy\u201d of his nephew in an extensive letter to Stefan Buszczy\u0144ski, his own ideological opponent and a friend of Conrad\u2019s late father Apollo.[note 14] To what extent the suicide attempt had been made in earnest, likely will never be known, but it is suggestive of a situational depression.[2]:65\u20137, 1027717=Although the precipitous downward spiral in U.S. economic freedom since 2008 has come to a halt in the 2015 Index, a 1.6-point decline in overall economic freedom over the past five years reflects broad-based deteriorations in key policy areas, particularly those related to upholding the rule of law and limited government. Continuing to trail such comparable economies as Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Canada, America has been ranked \u201cmostly free\u201d since 2010., 249000=Inevitably for a trilingual Polish\u2013French\u2013English-speaker, Conrad\u2019s writings occasionally show examples of \u201cFranglais\u201d and \u201cPoglish\u201d\u00a0\u2013 of the inadvertent use of French or Polish vocabulary, grammar or syntax in his English compositions. In one instance, Najder uses \u201cseveral slips in vocabulary, typical for Conrad (Gallicisms) and grammar (usually Polonisms)\u201d as part of internal evidence against Conrad\u2019s sometime literary collaborator Ford Madox Ford\u2018s claim to have written a certain instalment of Conrad\u2019s novel Nostromo, for serialised publication in T. P.\u2019s Weekly, on behalf of an ill Conrad.[2]:341\u201342, 663227=Planned Parenthood also has a political action committee called Planned Parenthood Action Fund. The committee was founded in 1996 by then new president Gloria Feldt for the purpose of maintaining reproductive health rights and supporting political candidates of the same mindset. In 2012 election cycle the committee gained prominence based on its effectiveness of spending on candidates.[75], 178981=In 1914, Conrad stayed at the Zakopanepension Konstantyn\u00f3wka, operated by his cousin Aniela Zag\u00f3rska, mother of his future Polish translator of the same name.[2]:462\u201363, 382317=America\u2019s best and brightest believe themselves qualified and duty bound to direct the lives not only of Americans but of foreigners as well. George W. Bush\u2019s 2005 inaugural statement that America cannot be free until the whole world is free and hence that America must push and prod mankind to freedom was but an extrapolation of the sentiments of America\u2019s Progressive class, first articulated by such as Princeton\u2019s Woodrow Wilson and Columbia\u2019s Nicholas Murray Butler. But while the early Progressives expected the rest of the world to follow peacefully, today\u2019s ruling class makes decisions about war and peace at least as much forcibly to tinker with the innards of foreign bodies politic as to protect America. Indeed, they conflate the two purposes in the face of the American people\u2019s insistence to draw a bright line between war against our enemies and peace with non-enemies in whose affairs we do not interfere. That is why, from Wilson to Kissinger, the ruling class has complained that the American people oscillate between bellicosity and \u201cisolationism.\u201d, 154355=During a brief call in India in 1885\u201386, 28-year-old Conrad sent five letters to Joseph Spiridion,[note 8] a Pole eight years his senior whom he had befriended at Cardiff in June 1885 just before sailing for Singapore in the clipper ship Tilkhurst. These letters are Conrad\u2019s first preserved texts in English. His English is generally correct but stiff to the point of artificiality; many fragments suggest that his thoughts ran along the lines of Polish syntax andphraseology. More importantly, the letters show a marked change in views from those implied in his earlier correspondence of 1881\u201383. He had departed from \u201chope for the future\u201d and from the conceit of \u201csailing [ever] toward Poland\u201d, and from his Panslavic ideas. He was left with a painful sense of the hopelessness of the Polish question and an acceptance of England as a possible refuge. While he often adjusted his statements to accord to some extent with the views of his addressees, the theme of hopelessness concerning the prospects for Polish independence often occurs authentically in his correspondence and works before 1914.[2]:104\u20135, 372273=Disregard for the text of laws \u2014 for the dictionary meaning of words and the intentions of those who wrote them \u2014 in favor of the decider\u2019s discretion has permeated our ruling class from the Supreme Court to the lowest local agency. Ever since Oliver Wendell Holmes argued in 1920 (Missouri v. Holland) that presidents, Congresses, and judges could not be bound by the U.S. Constitution regarding matters that the people who wrote and ratified it could not have foreseen, it has become conventional wisdom among our ruling class that they may transcend the Constitution while pretending allegiance to it. They began by stretching such constitutional terms as \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d and \u201cdue process,\u201d then transmuting others, e.g., \u201csearch and seizure,\u201d into \u201cprivacy.\u201d Thus in 1973 the Supreme Court endowed its invention of \u201cprivacy\u201d with a \u201cpenumbra\u201d that it deemed \u201cbroad enough to encompass a woman\u2019s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\u201d The court gave no other constitutional reasoning, period. Perfunctory to the point of mockery, this constitutional talk was to reassure the American people that the ruling class was acting within the Constitution\u2019s limitations. By the 1990s federal courts were invalidating amendments to state constitutions passed by referenda to secure the \u201cpositive rights\u201d they invent, because these expressions of popular will were inconsistent with the constitution they themselves were construing., 1033444=The regulatory burden has been mounting. Since 2009, over 150 new major regulations have been imposed at an annual cost of more than $70 billion. As of 2014, 125 new regulations were in the pipeline. The labor market, primarily regulated at the state level, remains flexible. Subsidies for agriculture, health care, and renewable energy have bred economic distortions., 12153=In 1972, Control, the head of British Intelligence (\u201cthe Circus\u201d), sends agent Jim Prideaux to Czechoslovakia to meet a Czech general who wishes to sell information. The operation is blown and a fleeing Prideaux is shot in the back by Russian soldiers and tortured. Amid the international incident that follows, Control and his deputy, George Smiley, are forced into retirement. Control, already ill, dies soon afterwards., 689692=In 1994, John Salvi entered a Brookline, Massachusetts Planned Parenthood clinic and opened fire, murdering receptionist Shannon Elizabeth Lowney and wounding three others. He fled to another Planned Parenthood clinic where he murdered Leane Nichols and wounded two others.[128], 177612=The couple rented a long series of successive homes, occasionally in France, sometimes briefly in London, but mostly in the English countryside, sometimes from friends\u00a0\u2013 to be close to friends, to enjoy the peace of the countryside, but above all because it was more affordable.[2][note 15] Except for several vacations in France and Italy, a 1914 vacation in his native Poland, and a 1923 visit to the United States, Conrad lived the rest of his life in England., 595462=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/16/politics/planned-parenthood-president-criticizes-gop-candidates/, 758108=Over the course of her career, Sanger was arrested at least eight times for expressing her views during an era in which speaking publicly about contraception was illegal.[105] Numerous times in her career, local government officials prevented Sanger from speaking by shuttering a facility or threatening her hosts.[106] In Boston in 1929, city officials under the leadership of James Curley threatened to arrest her if she spoke\u2014so she turned the threat to her advantage and stood on stage, silent, with a gag over her mouth, while her speech was read by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.[107], 707151=Accepting the connection proposed between contraception and working-class empowerment by radicals such as Emma Goldman, Sanger came to believe that only by liberating women from the risk of unwanted pregnancy would fundamental social change take place. She proceeded to launch a campaign to challenge governmental censorship of contraceptive information. She would set up a series of confrontational actions designed to challenge the law and force birth control to become a topic of public debate. Sanger\u2019s trip to France in 1913 exposed her to what Goldman had been saying. Sanger\u2019s experience during her trip to France directly influence The Women Rebel newsletter. The trip to France was also the beginning of the end of her marriage with William Sanger.[15], 875027=At the beginning of 2004, the U.S. economy was booming. Four middle-class tax cuts were extended, including a $1,000-per-couple child tax credit, expansion of the lowest (10 percent) tax bracket, exceptions for the alternative minimum tax, and relief from the \u201cmarriage penalty\u201d for two-income families. Another $140 billion in tax relief was granted to U.S. business. Unemployment dropped from 5.7 percent to 5.4 percent., 373733=By 2010 some in the ruling class felt confident enough to dispense with the charade. Asked what in the Constitution allows Congress and the president to force every American to purchase health insurance, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi replied: \u201cAre you serious? Are you serious?\u201d No surprise then that lower court judges and bureaucrats take liberties with laws, regulations, and contracts. That is why legal words that say you are in the right avail you less in today\u2019s America than being on the right side of the persons who decide what they want those words to mean., 284827=After respective separate visits to Conrad in August and September 1913, two British aristocrats, the socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell and the mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell\u00a0\u2013 who were lovers at the time\u00a0\u2013 recorded their impressions of the novelist. In her diary, Morrell wrote:, 854929=Still, the church and the police rank among the highest-rated institutions, trailing only the military and small business among the 15 institutions tested in this year\u2019s poll. Further back in history, the church ranked first or tied for first in all but one survey from 1973 through 1988. Since then, the military has been the top-ranked institution each year except 1997, when small business was first., 874239=\u201cAmericans\u2019 confidence in most major institutions has been down for many years as the nation has dealt with prolonged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a major recession and sluggish economic improvement,\u00a0and partisan gridlock in Washington,\u201d a Gallup spokesman said. \u201cIn fact, 2004 was the last year most institutions were at or above their historical average levels of confidence. Perhaps not coincidentally, 2004 was also the last year Americans\u2019 satisfaction with the way things are going in the United States averaged better than 40 percent. Currently, 28 percent of Americans are satisfied with the state of the nation.\u201d, 496521=The third view is that the Congress as a whole has the power to terminate treaties, based on an analogy between treaties and federal laws. When the United States first terminated a treaty in 1798 under John Adams, this procedure was adopted, but there was little discussion of the constitutional ramifications., 724917=Sanger invested a great deal of effort communicating with the general public. From 1916 onward, she frequently lectured\u2014in churches, women\u2019s clubs, homes, and theaters\u2014to workers, churchmen, liberals, socialists, scientists, and upper-class women.[49] She wrote several books in the 1920s which had a nationwide impact in promoting the cause of birth control. Between 1920 and 1926, 567,000 copies of Woman and the New Race and The Pivot of Civilization were sold.[50] She also wrote two autobiographies designed to promote the cause. The first, My Fight for Birth Control, was published in 1931 and the second, more promotional version, Margaret Sanger: An Autobiography, was published in 1938., 266397=Conrad is also reported to have stayed at Hong Kong\u2019s Peninsula Hotel\u2014a port that, in fact, he never visited. Later literary admirers, notably Graham Greene, followed closely in his footsteps, sometimes requesting the same room and perpetuating myths that have no basis in fact. No Caribbean resort is yet known to have claimed Conrad\u2019s patronage, although he is believed to have stayed at a Fort-de-Francepension upon arrival in Martinique on his first voyage, in 1875, when he travelled as a passenger on the Mont Blanc., 695730=In 1916, Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, which led to her arrest for distributing information on contraception. Her subsequent trial and appeal generated controversy. Sanger felt that in order for women to have a more equal footing in society and to lead healthier lives, they needed to be able to determine when to bear children. She also wanted to prevent unsafe abortions, so-called back-alley abortions, which were common at the time because abortions were usually illegal. She believed that while abortion was sometimes justified it should generally be avoided, and she considered contraception the only practical way to avoid the use of abortions.[citation needed], 696886=In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In New York City, she organized the first birth control clinic staffed by all-female doctors, as well as a clinic in Harlem with an entirely African-American staff. In 1929, she formed the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control, which served as the focal point of her lobbying efforts to legalize contraception in the United States. From 1952 to 1959, Sanger served as president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. She died in 1966, and is widely regarded as a founder of the modern birth control movement., 609570=Cecile Richards (born 1958)[1] is an American activist and has been the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America since 2006.[2] She is a member of the Democratic Party.[3] In 2010, Richards was elected to the Ford Foundation board of trustees., 144026=On 13 October 1874 Bobrowski sent the sixteen-year-old to Marseilles, France, for a planned career at sea.[2]:44\u201346 Though Conrad had not completed secondary school, his accomplishments included fluency in French (with a correct accent), some knowledge of Latin, German and Greek, probably a good knowledge of history, some geography, and probably already an interest in physics. He was well read, particularly in Polish Romantic literature. He belonged to only the second generation in his family that had had to earn a living outside the family estates: he was a member of the second generation of the intelligentsia, a social class that was starting to play an important role in Central and Eastern Europe.[2]:46\u201347 He had absorbed enough of the history, culture and literature of his native land to be able eventually to develop a distinctive world view and make unique contributions to the literature of his adoptive Britain.[10]:1\u20135 It was tensions that originated in his childhood in Poland and grew in his adulthood abroad that would give rise to Conrad\u2019s greatest literary achievements.[10]:246\u201347 Najder, himself an emigrant from Poland, observes:, 876152=By 2014, the Obama administration had announced its plan to shrink the military budget to $522 billion and slash the Army to a size unseen since before World War II. The nation also saw Americans impacted by a West African Ebola outbreak and revelations that the Veterans Administration had covered up exceedingly long wait times for veterans seeking medical attention., 476502=Between 1946 and 1999, the United States completed nearly 16,000 international agreements. Only 912 of those agreements were treaties, submitted to the Senate for approval as outlined in Article II of the United States Constitution. Since the Franklin Roosevelt\u00a0presidency, only 6% of international accords have been completed as Article II treaties.[1] Most of these executive agreements consist of congressional-executive agreements., 197617=To those who attended Conrad\u2019s funeral in Canterbury during the Cricket Festival of 1924, and drove through the crowded streets festooned with flags, there was something symbolical in England\u2019s hospitality and in the crowd\u2019s ignorance of even the existence of this great writer. A few old friends, acquaintances and pressmen stood by his grave.[2]:573, 164058=Almost all of Conrad\u2019s writings were first published in newspapers and magazines: influential reviews like The Fortnightly Review and the North American Review; avant-garde publications like the Savoy, New Review, and The English Review; popular short-fiction magazines like The Saturday Evening Post and Harper\u2019s Magazine; women\u2019s journals like the Pictorial Review and Romance; mass-circulation dailies like the Daily Mail and the New York Herald; and illustrated newspapers like The Illustrated London News and theIllustrated Buffalo Express.[citation needed] He also wrote for The Outlook, an imperialist weekly magazine, between 1898 and 1906.[14][note 11], 161360=While Conrad had only limited personal acquaintance with the peoples of Maritime Southeast Asia, the region looms large in his early work. According to Najder, Conrad, the exile and wanderer, was aware of a difficulty that he confessed more than once: the lack of a common cultural background with his Anglophone readers meant he could not compete with English-language authors writing about the Anglosphere. At the same time, the choice of a non-English colonial setting freed him from an embarrassing division of loyalty:Almayer\u2019s Folly, and later \u201cAn Outpost of Progress\u201d (1897, set in a Congo exploited by King Leopold II of Belgium) and Heart of Darkness (1899, likewise set in the Congo), contain bitter reflections on colonialism. The Malay states came theoretically under the suzerainty of the Dutch government; Conrad did not write about the area\u2019s British dependencies, which he never visited. He \u201cwas apparently intrigued by\u2026 struggles aimed at preserving national independence. The prolific and destructive richness of tropical nature and the dreariness of human life within it accorded well with the pessimistic mood of his early works.\u201d[2]:118\u201320 [note 9], 708133=In 1914, Sanger launched The Woman Rebel, an eight-page monthly newsletter which promoted contraception using the slogan \u201cNo Gods, No Masters\u201c.[16][note 2][17] Sanger, collaborating with anarchist friends, popularized the term \u201cbirth control\u201d as a more candid alternative to euphemisms such as \u201cfamily limitation\u201d[18] and proclaimed that each woman should be \u201cthe absolute mistress of her own body.\u201d[19] In these early years of Sanger\u2019s activism, she viewed birth control as a free-speech issue, and when she started publishing The Woman Rebel, one of her goals was to provoke a legal challenge to the federal anti-obscenity laws which banned dissemination of information about contraception.[20][21] Though postal authorities suppressed five of its seven issues, Sanger continuing publication, all the while preparing, Family Limitation, an even more blatant challenge to anti-birth control laws. This 16-page pamphlet contained detailed and precise information and graphic descriptions of various contraceptive methods. In August 1914 Margaret Sanger was indicted for violating postal obscenity laws by sending the The Woman Rebel through the postal system. Instead of standing trial, she jumped bail and fled to Canada. Then, under the alias \u201cBertha Watson\u201d, sailed for England. En route she ordered her labor associates to release copies of the Family Limitation.[22], 860532=While Congress has consistently received the lowest confidence rating of the three branches of government, the Supreme Court and the presidency usually track each other closely. This is apart from times when the incumbent president has been extremely popular, as in 1991 and 2002, or exceptionally unpopular, as in 2007 and 2008., 704724=During her work among working class immigrant women, Sanger was exposed to graphic examples of women going through frequent childbirth, miscarriage and self-induced abortion for lack of information on how to avoid unwanted pregnancy. Access to contraceptive information was prohibited on grounds of obscenity by the 1873 federal Comstock law and a host of state laws. Searching for something that would help these women, Sanger visited public libraries, but was unable to find information on contraception.[11] These problems were epitomized in a (possibly fictional) story that Sanger would later recount in her speeches: while Sanger was working as a nurse, she was called to the apartment of a woman, \u201cSadie Sachs,\u201d who had become extremely ill due to a self-induced abortion. Afterward, \u201cSadie\u201d (whose marital status Sanger never mentioned) begged the attending doctor to tell her how she could prevent this from happening again, to which the doctor simply advised her to remain abstinent. A few months later, Sanger was called back to \u201cSadie\u2019s\u201d apartment \u2014 only this time, \u201cSadie\u201d died shortly after Sanger arrived. She had attempted yet another self-induced abortion.[12][13] Sanger would sometimes end the story by saying, \u201cI threw my nursing bag in the corner and announced \u2026 that I would never take another case until I had made it possible for working women in America to have the knowledge to control birth.\u201d Although \u201cSadie Sachs\u201d was possibly a fictional composite of several women Sanger had known, this story marks the time when Sanger began to devote her life to help desperate women before they were driven to pursue dangerous and illegal abortions.[13][14]}",

The Social Progress Index defines social progress as the capacity of a society to meet the basic human needs of its citizens, establish the building blocks that allow citizens and communities to enhance and sustain the quality of their lives, and create the conditions for all individuals to reach their full potential. 1. Milton Friedman and Rose D. Friedman, Free to Choose: A Personal Statement (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1979). The principles of economic freedom are a sure guide, but only a guide. What truly will matter are the creative solutions to pressing world problems that are certain to flow from people who are, in the words of Milton and Rose Friedman, \u201cfree to choose.\u201d A recurring theme of human history has been resilience and revival. The country profiles in the 2015 Index of Economic Freedom include many examples of countries that have accelerated their economic and social progress in the face of difficult challenges and a sometimes harsh international environment. Their successes can be emulated by others. The Index of Economic Freedom charts not just one path to development, but as many as the ingenuity of humans can produce when they are free to experiment andinnovate. It is no coincidence that the increase of economic liberty over the past decades has coincided with a massive reduction in worldwide poverty, disease, and hunger. The link between economic",
