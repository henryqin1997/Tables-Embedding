It is 20,000 cheaper than a lot of private conservatories and the training is just as good or better! Plus, I go to classes (I'm required to, although I would anyway) everyday from 8:30 or 9:00 a.m. to 6 p.m.-11 p.m. Most of my friends at public schools pay about the same as me but only go to one or two classes every other day.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Food and Dining I eat at home. Dorm Life I gave this four stars because they are not the best dorms, not the worst and because it depends on what you are looking for. No crazy parties in dorms. Not enough time or continuity in schedule for it. But people are friendly and generally respectful. Most of my friends never locked their doors when they lived in the dorms. It's such a tiny school filled with people who are really passionate about what they do. Not a lot of drifters. Academic Rigor Well, here's the thing. Academics definitely come second here to art. However, you must stay in good academic standing which can be difficult with the schedule. There are some really tough courses and a lot of medium level (for toughness) courses. All require more time than you probably have so be prepared to improvise. Luckily, a lot of them have to do with art in some way. In three sentences It has been called the magic hill and I believe it is. Magic is made, created, imagined, seen, and discovered here. YOU WILL WORK HARDER THAN YOU EVER HAVE AND BE MORE EXHAUSTED THAN YOU'VE EVER BEEN AND, HOPEFULLY, THE MOST",
