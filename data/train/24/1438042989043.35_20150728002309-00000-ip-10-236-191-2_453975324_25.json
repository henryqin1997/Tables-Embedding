In some embodiments, the three dimensional integrated circuits include one or more electronic components that include a semiconductive region formed of one or more semiconductive organic materials. The electronic components of the three dimensional integrated circuits may also include insulating regions formed from organic insulating materials, and conductive regions form from conductive materials. The three dimensional integrated circuits may be formed by an additive manufacturing process such as three dimensional printing. Apparatus and methods for producing and testing three dimensional integrated circuits are also described. 20140152383 Published Description Patent application number Jin Pan, Hillsboro, OR US 10-10-2013 Diagnostics of Hot-Standby/Redundant Owner System in an Ethernet/IP Adapter Device - Method, apparatuses, and software are described, in which an adapter in an EtherNet/IP network may determine whether a first redundant owner connection between the adapter and a first scanner is open. If it is determined that the first redundant owner connection is not open, then a network status light or other indicator of the adapter may be caused to emit a solid green color or otherwise indicate a first status if a second redundant owner connection between the adapter and a second scanner is open, and to emit a flashing red color or a flashing green color (or otherwise indicate",
    "textAfterTable": "Jing Jong Pan US Patent application number Description Published 20100027096 Tunable Optical Filter and Method of Manufacture Thereof - A tunable optical filter is formed in the structure of an etalon. A thin electro-optic ceramic substrate is fixed between two end substrates. Each end substrate has an inner parallel surface toward said electro-optic ceramic substrate covered by an electrode layer and a reflecting layer. An adhesive which attaches the electro-optic ceramic substrate to each first and second end substrates has a consistency so as to avoid stress on the electro-optic ceramic substrate. A voltage imposed on the electro-optic ceramic substrate by the electrode layers on the inner parallel surfaces of the first and second end substrates effectively controls an optical distance between the reflective coating layers on the inner parallel surfaces of the first and second end substrates of the etalon structure. The electro-optic ceramic substrate is preferably PMN-PT ((1-x)Pb(Mg\u2153Nb\u2154)O 02-04-2010 Jingning Pan, Tucson, AZ US Patent application number Description Published 20100021084 RESOLUTION ENHANCEMENT OF VIDEO SEQUENCES WITH ARBITRARY ENHANCEMENT FACTOR - Restoration based super-resolution combines a video sequence of low-resolution noisy blurred images using maximum likelihood estimation without regularization to produce a higher resolution image or video sequence up to a maximum enhancement factor r for the given video sequence. The maximum r value for a given sequence of low-resolution images that guarantees each high-resolution bin (pixel) will have",
