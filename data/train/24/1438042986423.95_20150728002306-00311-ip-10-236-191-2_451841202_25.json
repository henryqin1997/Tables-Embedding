            "Desulfurization system and method for desulfurizing a fuel stream - A method for producing a substantially desulfurized a hydrocarbon fuel stream at temperatures less than 100\u00b0 C. The method includes providing a nondesulfurized fuel cell hydrocarbon fuel stream that may include water and passing the fuel stream sequentially through a zeolite Y adsorbent and a selective sulfur adsorbent. The zeolite Y adsorbent may be exchanged with copper ions. The method produces a substantially desulfurized hydrocarbon fuel stream containing less than 50 ppb sulfur.",

Steve Spivey, Louisville, KY US 03-03-2011 Recliner Apparatus - An adjustable recliner apparatus is provided having a seat member with a seat back portion pivotally attached to a seat bottom portion. The apparatus also includes a channel assembly. The channel assembly is made of a flange, a plurality of rollers connected to the flange and a channel configured to accommodate a plurality of rollers. The channel has a detent positioned to hold the seat back portion in substantially vertical position and this detent is sized to retard at least one of the plurality of rollers from rolling past the detent. The channel assembly is connected to the recliner frame and the flange is connected to the seat bottom portion of the seat member. 20110049956 Published Description Patent application number Ronnie C.
