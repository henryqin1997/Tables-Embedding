    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{73411=pSX50 (described in U.S. application Ser. No. 039,298, supra) is a derivative of plasmid pDN 1050, comprising the promoter-operator P1O1 the B. pumilus xyn B gene and the B. subtilis xyl R gene., 28907=FIG. 3 illustrates gapped duplex mutagenesis, using the method of Morinaga et al. (1984, Biotechnology 2:636-639). It features two plasmids, pSX93 and pSX119, both derived from puCl3. pSX93 contains an XbaI-HindIII fragment of the subtilisin 309 gene, and pSX119 contains the remainder of the subtilisin 309 gene in an EcoRI-XbaI fragment. In (A), plasmid pSX93 is cleaved with XbaI and ClaI, and the gapped molecules are mixed with pSX93 cut with ScaI, denatured, and allowed to reanneal so as to generate plasmids with a region of single-stranded DNA extending within the subtilisin 309 coding sequence. A synthetic oligonucleotide, homologous to the subtilisin 309 gene but containing a mutation, is allowed to anneal to the single stranded gap, which is then filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA ligase. Upon replication of the plasmid, double-stranded mutants of the subtilisin 309 gene are generated. The same procedure is performed in (B), using plasmid pSX119 and EcoRI and XbaI enzymes, to create mutations in the corresponding region of the subtilisin 309 gene., 62235=The mutagens nitrous acid and formic acid may also be used to produce mutant libraries. Because these chemicals are not as specific for single-stranded DNA as sodium bisulfite, the mutagenesis reactions are performed according to the following procedure. The coding portion of the subtilisin gene is cloned in M13 phage by standard methods and single stranded phage DNA prepared. The single-stranded DNA is then reacted with 1 M nitrous acid pH 4.3 for 15-60 minutes at 23\ufffd C. or 2.4 M formic acid for 1-5 minutes at 23\ufffd C. These ranges of reaction times produce a mutation frequency of from 1 in 1000 to 5 in 1000. After mutagenesis, a universal primer is annealed to the M13 DNA and duplex DNA is synthesized using the mutagenized single stranded DNA as a template so that the coding portion of the subtilisin gene becomes fully double-stranded. At this point the coding region can be cut out of the M13 vector with restriction enzymes and ligated into an unmutagenized expression vector so that mutations occur only in the restriction fragment. (Myers et al., 1985, Science 229:242-257)., 32286=The amino acid sequences of at least eight subtilisins are known. These include six subtilisins from Bacillus strains, namely, subtilisin 168, subtilisin BPN\u2032, subtilisin Carlsberg, subtilisin DY, subtilisin amylosacchariticus and mesentericopeptidase (Kurihara et al., 1972, J. Biol. Chem. 247:5629-5631; Stahl and Ferrari, 1984, J. Bacteriol. 158:411-418; Vasantha et al., 1984, J. Bacteriol. 159:811-819; Jacobs et al., 1985, Nucl. Acids Res. 13:8913-8926; Nedkov et al., 1985, Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 366:421-430; Svendsen et al., 1986, FEBS Lett. 196:228-232), and two fungal subtilisins, subtilisin thermitase from Thermoactinymyces vulgaris (Meloun et al., 1985, FEBS Lett. 183:195-200), and proteinase K from Tritirichium album limber (Janny and Mayer, 1985, Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 366:485-492)., 78190=A 2% (w/v) solution of casein (Hammarstein, supplied by Merck A. G., West Germany) was prepared with the Universal Buffer described by Britton and Robinson (Journ. Chem. Soc. 1931, p. 1451), adjusted to pH 9.5., 23129=A subtilisin is a serine protease produced by Gram-positive bacteria or fungi. A wide variety of subtilisins have been identified, and the amino acid sequences of at least eight subtilisins have been determined. These include six subtilisins from Bacillus strains, namely, subtilisin 168, subtilisin BPN\u2032, subtilisin Carlsberg, subtilisin DY, subtilisin amylosacchariticus, and mesentericopeptidase (Kurihara et al., 1972, J. Biol. Chem. 247:5629-5631; Stahl and Ferrari, 1984, J. Bacteriol. 158:411-418; Vasantha et al., 1984, J. Bacteriol. 159:811-819, Jacobs et al., 1985, Nucl. Acids Res. 13:8913-8926; Nedkov et al., 1985, Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 366:421-430; Svendsen et al., 1986, FEBS Lett 196:228-232), and two fungal subtilisins, subtilisin thermitase from Thermoactinymyces vulgaris (Meloun et al., 1985, FEBS Lett. 183:195-200) and proteinase K from Tritirachium album (Jany and Mayer, 1985, Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 366:584-492)., 34357=Table I compares the deduced amino acid sequences of subtilisin 309, subtilisin 147, subtilisin BPN\u2032, subtilisin Carlsberg and subtilisin 168 (Spizizen, et al., 1958, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 44:1012-1078). Table II presents the nucleic acid sequence of the subtilisin 309 gene, and Table III presents the nucleic acid sequence of the subtilisin 147 gene. The sequences of subtilisin 309 or 147, or their functional equivalents, can be used in accordance with the invention. For example, the sequences of subtilisin 309 or 147 depicted in Tables I, II or III can be altered by substitutions, additions or deletions that provide for functionally equivalent molecules. For example, due to the degeneracy of nucleotide coding sequences, other DNA sequences which encode substantially the same amino acid sequence as depicted in Table I may be used in the practice of the present invention. These include but are not limited to nucleotide sequences comprising all or portions of the subtilisin 309 or 147 sequences depicted in Table II or III which are altered by the substitution of different codons that encode the same or a functionally equivalent amino acid residues within the sequence, thus producing a silent change. For example, one or more amino acid residues within the sequence can be substituted by another amino acid of a similar polarity which acts as a functional equivalent. Substitutes for an amino acid within the sequence may be selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs. For example, the non-polar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine. The polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine. The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine. The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic and glutamic acid., 87958=As outlined in FIG. 1 the fragments were annealed and ligated to BamHI cut plasmid pSX50 (described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 039,298 filed Apr. 17, 1987, is which is hereby included for reference). The plasmids were then transformed into competent B. subtilis DN 497., 64682=Once the subtilisin gene has been cloned, and desirable sites for mutation identified, these mutations can be introduced using synthetic oligo nucleotides. These oligonucleotides contain nucleotide sequences flanking the desired mutation sites; mutant nucleotides are inserted during oligonucleotide synthesis. In a preferred method, a single stranded gap of DNA, bridging the subtilisin gene, is created in a vector bearing the subtilisin gene. Then the synthetic nucleotide, bearing the desired mutation, is annealed to a homologous portion of the single-stranded DNA. The remaining gap is then filled in by DNA polymerase I. (Klenow fragment) and the construct is ligated using T4 ligase. A specific example of this method is described in Morinaga et al. (1984, Biotechnology 2:636-639). According to Morinaga et al., a fragment within the gene is removed using restriction endonuclease. The vector/gene, now containing a gap, is then denatured and hybridized to vector/gene which, instead of containing a gap, has been cleaved with another restriction endonuclease at a site outside the area involved in the gap. A single-stranded region of the gene is then available for hybridization with mutated oligonucleotides, the remaining gap is filled in by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, the insertions are ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and, after one cycle of replication, a double-stranded plasmid bearing the desired mutation is produced. The Morinaga method obviates the additional manipulation of construction new restriction sites, and therefore facilitates the generation of mutations at multiple sites. U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,025, by Estelle et al., issued Jul. 26, 1988, is able to introduce oligonucleotides bearing multiple mutations by performing minor alterations of the cassette, however, an even greater variety of mutations can be introduced at any one time by the Morinaga method, because a multitude of oligonucleotides, of various lengths, can be introduced., 21449=Enzymes cleaving the amide linkages in protein substrates are classified as proteases, or (interchangeably) peptidases (See Walsh, 1979, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, Chapter 3). Bacteria of the Bacillus species secrete two extracellular species of protease, a neutral, or metalloprotease, and an alkaline protease which is functionally a serine endopeptidase, referred to as subtilisin. Secretion of these proteases has been linked to the bacterial growth cycle, with greatest expression of protease during the stationary phase, when sporulation also occurs. Joliffe et al. (1980, J. Bacterial. 141:1199-1208) has suggested that Bacillus proteases function in cell wall turnover., 22237=A serine protease is an enzyme which catalyses the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, in which there is an essential serine residue at the active site (White, Handler, and Smith, 1973, \u201cPrinciples of Biochemistry,\u201d Fifth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, pp. 271-272)., 40103=Wells et al. (1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84:1219-1223) have used comparison of amino acid sequences and site-directed mutation to engineer subtilisin substrate specificity. The catalytic activities of various subtilisins can differ markedly against selected substrates. Wells has shown that only three amino acid substitutions can cause B. amyloliquefaciens subtilisin substrate specificity to approach that of B. licheniformis subtilisin, enzymes that differ by factors of 10-50 in catalytic efficiency in their native state. Comparison analysis between subtilisin 147 and 309 and other subtilisins has indicated that mutation of the following sites may alter the physical or chemical properties of subtilisin: 6, 9, 11-12, 19, 25, 36-38, 53-59, 67, 71, 89, 104, 111, 115, 120, 121-122, 124, 128, 131, 140, 153-166, 168, 169-170, 172, 175, 180, 182, 186, 187, 191, 194, 195, 199, 218, 219, 222, 226, 234-238, 241, 260-262, 265, 268, or 275. Deletions occur at the following sites in subtilisins 147 and/or 309; insertion of appropriate amino acid residues into these sites might enhance the stability of the parent enzymes: 1, 36, 56, 159, 164-166. According to the method illustrated by these examples, which are not limiting, a number of potential mutation sites become apparent., 116114=Gapped duplex mutagenesis was performed using the plasmid pSX93 as template. pSX93 is shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, and is pUC13 (Vieira, J. and Messing, J., 1982, Gene 19: 259-268) harboring an 0.7 kb XbaI-HindIII fragment of the subtilisin 309 gene including the terminator inserted in the polylinker. The terminator and the HindIII site are not shown in Table II., 72525=B. subtilis 309 and 147 are variants of Bacillus lentus, deposited with the NCIB and accorded the accession numbers NCIB 10147 and NCIB 10309, and described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,723,250, issued Mar. 27, 1973, and fully incorporated herein by reference herein. B. subtilis DN 497 is described in U.S. application Ser. No. 039,298 filed Apr. 17, 1987, which is also fully incorporated herein by reference, and is an aro+ transformant of RUB 200 with chromosomal DNA from SL 438, a sporulation and protease deficient strain obtained from Dr. Kim Hardy of Biogen. E. coli MC 1000 r\u2212m+ (Casa-daban, M. J. and Cohen, S. N. (1980), J. Mol. Biol. 138:179-207, was made r\u2212m+ by conventional methods and is also described in U.S. application Ser. No. 039,298, supra., 82051=The tests were performed in a Terg-O-tometer test washing machine (described in Jay C. Harris \u201cDetergency Evaluation and Testing\u201d, Interscience Publishers Ltd., 1954, p.60-61) isothermally for 10 minutes at 100 rpm. As detergent the following standard powder detergent was used:, 73913=pSX93, shown in FIG. 3A, is puC13 (Vieira and Messing, 1982, Gene 19:259-268) comprising a 0.7 kb XbaI-Hind III fragment of the subtilisin 309 gene including the terminator inserted in a polylinker sequence., 86477=The cloths were then air dryed overnight (protected against day light) and the remission, R, determined on a E1REPHO 2000 spectrophotometer from Datacolor S.A., Dietkikon, Switzerland at 460 nm., 20296=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/486,846 filed Jun. 7, 1995 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,506,589, which is a division of application Ser. No. 07/294,241 filed Jan. 6, 1989 now abandoned and claims priority of Danish application no. 64/88 filed Jan. 7, 1988, the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference., 63345=By yet another method, mutations can be generated by allowing two dissimilar forms of subtilisin to undergo recombination in vivo. According to this method, homologous regions within the two genes lead to a cross-over of corresponding regions resulting in the exchange of genetic information. The generation of hybrid amylase molecules according to this technique is fully described in U.S. application Ser. No. 67,992, filed on Jun. 29, 1987, which is fully incorporated herein by reference. An example of a plasmid which can generate hybrid forms of subtilisin is depicted in FIG. 5. Both the subtilisin 309 and 147 genes, incorporated into plasmid pSX143, are truncated, and therefore cannot themselves lead to subtilisin expression. However, if recombination occurs between the two genes so as to correct the defect produced by truncation, i.e., the N terminal region of the subtilisin 309 gene becomes linked to the C terminal region of the subtilisin 147 gene, then active, mutant subtilisin can be produced. If pSX143 is incorporated into a protease-negative strain of bacteria, and then bacteria that develop a protease positive phenotype are selected, then various mutants, subtilisin 309/147 chimeras, can be identified., 117590=Subsequent to annealing, filling and ligation the mixture was used to transform E. coli MC 1000 r\u2212m+. Mutants among the transformants were screened for by colony hybridization as described in Vlasuk et al., 1983, J. Biol. Chem., 258:7141-7148 and in Vlasuk, G. P. and Inouye, S., p. 292-303 in \u2018Experimental Manipulation of Gene Expression\u2019 Inouye, M. (ed.) Academic Press, New York. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing., 22524=The serine proteases have molecular weights in the 25,000 to 30,000 range. They are inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, but in contrast to metalloproteases, are resistant to ethylenediamine-tetra acetic acid (EDTA) (although they are stabilized at high temperatures by calcium ion). They hydrolyze simple terminal esters and are similar in activity to eukaryotic chymotrypsin, also a serine protease. The alternative term, alkaline protease, reflects the high pH optimum of the serine proteases, from pH 9.0 to 11.0 (for review, see Priest, 1977, Bacteriological Rev. 41:711-753)., 73661=pSX65 (described in U.S. application Ser. No. 039,298, supra) is a derivative of plasmid pDN 1050, comprising the promoter-operator P2O2, the B. pumilus xyn B gene, and the B. subtilis xyl R gene., 24113=Subtilisins are well-characterized physically and chemically. In addition to knowledge of the primary structure (amino acid sequence) of these enzymes, over 50 high resolution X-ray structures of subtilisin have been determined which delineate the binding of substrate, transition state, products, three different protease inhibitors, and define the structural consequences for natural variation (Kraut, 1971, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 46:331-358). Random and site-directed mutations of the subtilisin gene have both arisen from knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of the enzyme and contributed information relating to subtilisin's catalytic activity, substrate specificity, tertiary structure, etc. (Wells et al., 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84:1219-1223; Wells et al., 1986, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A. 317:415-423; Hwang and Warshel, 1987, Biochem. 26:2669-2673; Rao et al., 1987, Nature 328:551-554)., 36326=Closeness of relation can be measured by comparison of amino acid sequences. There are many methods of aligning protein sequences, but the differences are only manifest when the degree of relatedness is quite small. The methods described in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, Margaret O. Dayhoff editor, vol. 5, supplement 2, 1976, National Biomedical Research Foundation, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D.C., p. 3 ff., entitled SEARCH and ALIGN, define relatedness. As is well known in the art, related proteins can differ in number of amino acids as well as identity of each amino acid along the chain. That is, there can be deletions or insertions when two structures are aligned for maximum identity. For example, subtilisin Carlsberg has only 274 amino acids while subtilisin BPN\u2032 has 275 amino acids. Aligning the two sequences shows that Carlsberg has no residue corresponding to Asn 56 of subtilisin BPN\u2032. Thus the amino acid sequence of Carlsberg would appear very different from subtilisin BPN\u2032 unless a gap is recorded at location 56. Therefore, one can predict with a high degree of confidence that substituting Ser for Asn at location 218 of subtilisin Carlsberg will increase thermal stability provided that the residues in Carlsberg are numbered by homology to subtilisin BPN\u2032., 59147=Another method would involve generating a single stranded form of the subtilisin gene, and then annealing the fragment of DNA containing the subtilisin gene with another DNA fragment such that a portion of the subtilisin gene remained single stranded. This discrete, single stranded region could then be exposed to any of a number of mutagenizing agents, including, but not limited to, sodium bisulfite, hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, formic acid, or hydralazine. A specific example of this method for generating random mutations is described by Shortle and Nathans (1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 75:2170-2174). According to the Shortle and Nathans method, the plasmid bearing the subtilisin gene would be nicked by a restriction enzyme that cleaves within the gene. This nick would be widened into a gap using the exonuclease action of DNA polymerase I. The resulting single-stranded gap could then be mutagenized using any one of the above mentioned mutagenizing agents., 66734=According to the invention, a mutated subtilisin gene produced by methods described above, or any alternative methods known in the art, can be expressed, in enzyme form, using an expression vector. An expression vector generally falls under the definition of a cloning vector, since an expression vector usually includes the components of a typical cloning vector, namely, an element that permits autonomous replication of the vector in a microorganism independent of the genome of the microorganism, and one or more phenotypic markers for selection purposes. An expression vector includes control sequences encoding a promoter, operator, ribosome binding site, translation initiation signal, and, optionally, a repressor gene. To permit the secretion of the expressed protein, nucleotides encoding a \u201csignal sequence\u201d may be inserted prior to the coding sequence of the gene. For expression under the direction of control sequences, a target gene to be treated according to the invention is operably linked to the control sequences in the proper reading frame. Promoter sequences that can be incorporated into plasmid vectors, and which can support the transcription of the mutant subtilisin gene, include but are not limited to the prokaryotic beta-lactamase promoter (Villa-Kamaroff, et al., 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75:3727-3731) and the tac promoter (DeBoer, et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:21-25).

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Subtilisin genes were cloned from the 147 and 309 variants of the bacterium Bacillus lentus, and the cloned genes were sequenced. By comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of subtilisins 147 and 309 one with the other and with sequences of other subtilisins, sites which, upon mutation, might alter the physical properties of the parent enzyme were identified. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate mutations at several of these sites in the subtilisin 309 gene. The resulting mutant enzymes were then expressed in a Bacillus strain, and tested against various physical and chemical parameters. Several of the mutants were shown to have improved stability to oxidation, increased proteolytic ability, or improved washability when compared with subtilisin 309.
