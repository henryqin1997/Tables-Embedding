    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{160631=Storage Stability: Samples of each grind size were mixed with 0.2 parts per hundred of fumed silica to improve powder flow. The silica was mixed in a lab-scale high intensity mixer at moderate mixing speeds (1000 RPMs for 30 seconds). Finally the samples were sieved through an 80-mesh screen to remove any large agglomerates or contamination formed during any stage of the process. The amount of material removed by the sieve was negligible (less than 0.5%). For each storage test approximately 100 grams were placed in a sample jar. The sample jars were then placed in water baths set at 35\ufffd C. and 40\ufffd C. Samples based on all three particle sizes (coarse, medium and fine) were tested. They were checked visually for one week at 24-hour cycles. After the first week, they were checked on a weekly basis for up to 30 days., 124921=General Powder Coating Extrusion and Grinding Process: The material to be extruded was passed through a lab size 30 mm APV twin screw extruder (model MP 30-PC; APV Chemical Machiner, Inc.) using the settings of: 200\u2013500 rpm, 50\ufffd F.\u2013250\ufffd F. barrel temperature; 20\u2013150 kg/hr. feed rate. The material was cooled on a water cooled chilled roller, chipped into smaller pieces, optionally post add material was added in-line if the host material required it, and then the material was transported to and ground on a Hosakwa Mikropul ACM-10 grinder with an approximate speed of 2000 to 6000 rpm. The ground-powdered material was circulated through a Hosakwa Mikropul 16-VME cyclone separator (510 CFM airflow, 2000 rpm) to a Sweco X-530566 sieve separator equipped with a 165 mesh screen., 77037=An ordered mixture generally is a mixture in which one or more relatively small guest particles are associated onto the surfaces of one or more relatively large core particles. Typically, one or more kinds of guest particles independently may have a median particle size of less than about 10 micrometers. The one or more kinds of core particles typically independently may have a median particle size in the range of about 15 micrometers to about 50 micrometers, although larger core particles may be used in some applications. Within such ranges, it is also desirable that the relative sizes of the host and guest particles are suitable for forming an ordered mixture. Thus, it is preferred that the ratio of the volume average particle size of the host particles to the guest particles is greater than about 3:1, more preferably greater than about 10:1, and more preferably greater than about 20:1. Optionally, one or more liquid ingredients may be included in the ingredients used to make an ordered mixture., 89171=The volume fraction, or density, of particle matter in the fluidized material can impact the effectiveness of the heat treatment. If the volume fraction of particulate matter in the heating zone is too high, too many inter-particle collisions may occur during heat treatment, resulting in more inter-particle cluster agglomeration than is desired. On the other hand, there is really no lower limit on density from a technical perspective, although if the density is too low, the product output of the heat treatment per unit time may be too low to be as economically practical as desired. The upper limit on volume fraction is a practical one as well. If the density of fluidized material is too great, too many collisions might occur that would tend to cause undue inter-particle agglomeration. As general guidelines, fluidizing about 1 to about 100, preferably about 1 to about 20, more preferably about 10 kg/hr of solids per about 200 to about 10,000, preferably about 500 to about 2000, more preferably about 900 ft3/hr of carrier gas would be suitable in the practice of the present invention., 79728=A wide variety of commercially available equipment may be used to prepare the particulate mixtures. Examples of suitable mixing devices include high speed batch mixers (such as mixing equipment commercially available as Mixaco from Mixaco Maschinenbau, or Welex from Gunther Papermeier, or the hybridizer from Nara Machinery, or the Mechanofusion unit available from HMPS (Hosokawa Micron Particle Systems; continuous high shear mixers (such as the Turbilizer from Hosokawa Bepex,); the RFBC (Rotating Fluidized Bed Coating) as described in \u201cSynthesis of Engineered Particulates Using Dry Particle Coating, Powder Technology 117 (2001) pg 40\u201367 \u201dor U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,369; the MAIC (Magnetically Assisted Impact Coating device as described in the article \u201cMagnetically Assisted Impaction Coating Process to Synthesize Engineered Particulates with Controlled Surface Characteristics,\u201d Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol 501, 1998 Materials Research Society.), motionless or static mixers, electrostatic mixing methods, fluidized beds, mixing jets, combinations of these (such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,369); combinations of these, and the like., 137499=The LS-230 has a measurable range of 0.040 \u03bcm\u20132000 \u03bcm and was chosen in order to demonstrate the effect that occurs on the fine particles after passing through the flash fusion step. For powder coating application purposes, \u201cfines\u201d are small resin particles or guest particles that are less than 10 \u03bcm in diameter. The fine particles have the most significant effect on the number average mean particle diameter result from a particle size distribution analysis. The fines also have a strong influence on the d10 particle size distribution results. The largest total number of particles in conventionally produced powder coating are generally less than 2 \u03bcm in diameter. This is easily demonstrated by measuring the number average mean diameter of the powder using testing equipment capable of accurately measuring these particles. It is also supported by visual inspection of SEM micrographs., 112342=Representative crystalline raw materials that could be used in the practice of the present invention include but are not limited to crystalline epoxy resins and epoxy functional curatives such as TGIC (triglycidyl isocyanurate), Dow crystalline epoxy resin RSS-1407 (trade secret) and Kukdo crystalline epoxy YDC 1312(trade secret); crystalline and semi-crystalline polyester resins such as Uvecoat 9010 from UCB; crystalline polyether resins such as Uracross P-3307 from DSM; crystalline acid curatives such as DDDA (dodecanedioic acid), azeleic acid, adipic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid and sebacic acid.; anhydride curatives such as pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA), amine functional curatives such as dicyanodiamide and 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenyl sulfone; hydroxy functional curatives such \u03b2-hydroxyalkyl amide (Primid XL-552 from Rohm & Haas); crystalline additives such as photoinitiators (Irgacure 819 and Irgacure 2959 from Ciba-Geigy), catalysts such as Vestagon B31 from Huls and Dyhard PI from, solid plasticizers such as sucrose benzoate, pentarythritol tetrabenzoate and cyclohexanedimethanol dibenzoate (Benzoflex 352 from Velsicol); flow modifiers such as polyolefin waxes such as Lanco Wax TF-1780 and TF-1830; degassing agents such as benzoin; UV absorbers such as Tinuvin 622 and Tinuvin 144 from Ciba-Geigy, and antioxidants such as Irganox 1010 and Irganox 1076 from Ciba-Geigy; combinations of these, and the like., 96856=The temperature of the hot air supplied to heating zone 30 is typically at a temperature of from about 50\ufffd F. to about 1500\ufffd F., and more preferably from about 400\ufffd F. to about 800\ufffd F., although the actual heat source itself may be considerably higher, such as about 900\ufffd F. Residence time in the flash heating zone 30 is relatively brief, e.g., about 2 to about 10 seconds being typical. The temperature of the hot air and the heating zone 30 may not be the same. For example, in a preferred embodiment, 900 ft3/hr of hot air at 900\ufffd F. may be co-introduced to vessel 20 with 900 ft3/hr of a feed containing 10 kg/hr solids at 25\ufffd C. Under such circumstances, the hot air is for practical purposes diluted in half. Consequently, the heating zone 30 will be constituted by 1800 ft3/hr of hot air at about 450\ufffd F. to 460\ufffd F. or so.}",
