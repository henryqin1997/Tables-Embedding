This ship observing program consists of approximately 70 vessels, which started in 1991 to take and transmit sea level pressure readings. Great Lakes ships are also now using the same form as high seas vessels to report weather observations--WS Form B-81. A few Great Lakes ships without weather instrumentation send plain language reports using NOAA Form 72-5b, Marine Coastal Weather Log Ship Station. Two PMOs, located in Cleveland, Ohio, and Rosemont, Illinois, provide service to Great Lakes vessels., 3419=Cancels WSOM Chapter B-30, issuances 77-8 and 78-14, dated June 23, 1977, and August 17, 1978, respectively., 142348=WSOM Issuance 92-4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8-26-92, 12300=2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General. The NWS program for acquisition of oceanic surface weather reports is based upon national needs and international agreements, and is an integral part of the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) \"World Weather Watch.\" Merchant ships that participate in the U.S.-managed portion of the VOS program are recruited by port meteorological officers (PMO), who spend the majority of their time visiting ships. NWS VOS program vessels are asked to take observations at standard synoptic times (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 Universal Time Coordinated) while at sea. Additional reports are requested at 3 hourly intervals within 300 miles of named tropical storms or hurricanes and 200 miles of the U.S. and Canadian coasts. The collection of marine reports from the Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico, western North Atlantic, and eastern North Pacific Oceans is a coordinated effort between the NWS, U.S. Coast Guard, and commercial shore radio stations. The International Maritime Satellites (INMARSAT) are playing a growing role in the data collection. Dissemination of marine reports on national and international communication circuits is controlled by the communications facility at the National Meteorological Center, Camp Springs, Maryland. Great Lakes marine observations are dis6eminated by the Weather Service Forecast Offices at Cleveland, Ohio, and Ann Arbor, Michigan.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "5.3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Instrument Quality Checks. The PMO should check all the weather-observing equipment aboard ship during the visit. NWS VOS program ships have barometers corrected to read sea level pressure. To correct to sea level, the portable inspection barometer should be brought to the bridge and the bridge height determined. The height correction is found by multiplying the bridge height in feet by the correction factor, 0.037 milibars per foot (Exhibit B-30-2). The ship's barometer is then set to sea level pressure by adding the height correction to the inspection barometer reading. If the ship's barometer cannot be adjusted, a height correction (plus or minus) must be applied by the observer to achieve a sea level pressure reading. The correction should be entered on WS Form B-13, Barometer Correction Label, and posted on or near the barometer face. Several barometer comparisons should be made to figure the proper height correction. Some large vessels, such as bulk carriers, ride either fully loaded or empty without ballast. Two different corrections should be provided for these ships since large changes in draft can cause considerable pressure difference. To maintain accuracy, the ship inspection barometer should be checked each day by the PMO before and after ship visitations. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5.3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Instructions on Observation Techniques.
