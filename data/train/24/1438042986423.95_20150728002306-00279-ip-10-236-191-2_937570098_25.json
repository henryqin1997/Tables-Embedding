If you must, substitute exercises with a similar variation. However, switching from back squat to leg extension isn't a viable option; switching from back squat to front squat or hack squat is. You get the idea. Most of the sessions involve exercise pairings. If you absolutely can't alternate between exercises, perform all of the prescribed parameters before moving on to the next exercise. The Program Duration: 2 weeks Purpose: To force your muscular and nervous systems to recover from training in less than 24 hours. Phase V:\u2002 Peak Frequency Stimulus Duration: 1 week Purpose: To recruit even more high-threshold motor units than Phase 2. This phase will set you up for big gains in Phase V since you'll have enhanced your ability to recruit muscle fibers. Phase IV:\u2002 Max Motor Unit Recruitment 2 Duration: 2 weeks Purpose: To reestablish a moderately high frequency plan in order to force the muscles to recover more quickly between workouts. Phase III:\u2002 Augment Frequency Stimulus Duration: 1 week Basically, you'll recruit your entire muscle fiber population (minus the emergency reserve that's virtually untouchable without a life-or-death scenario). This phenomenon is based on Henneman's size priniciple. Purpose: To retrain your nervous system to recruit the high-threshold motor",
