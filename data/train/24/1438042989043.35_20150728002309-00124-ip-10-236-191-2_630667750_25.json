Due to Hyperthreading, the two cores can handle up to four threads in parallel leading to better utilization of the CPU. Each core offers a base speed of 1.9 GHz but can dynamically increase clock rates with Turbo Boost up to 2.7 GHz (for 2 active cores) and 2.9 GHz (for 1 active core). As its Sandy-Bridge-based predecessors, it offers a 3 MB L3-Cache., 6529=Ivy Bridge is an enhanced\u00a0die shrink\u00a0of the Sandy Bridge architecture with improvements on both GPU and CPU performance. The CPUs are produced in 22nm (versus 32nm Sandy Bridge CPUs) and are the first to introduce\u00a03D transistors\u00a0for\u00a0increased energy efficiency when compared to similarly clocked Sandy Bridge processors. Other new features are integrated PCI Express 3.0 and\u00a0 DDR3(L)-1600 support.}",
