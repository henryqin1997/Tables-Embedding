The equation for the equivalent reactance Xe is given as follows: X e = - B 2 A + B 2 - 4 AC 2 A , ( 6 ) where A, B, and C are given by: A=1.05*0.05*sI 1 2;\u2003\u2003(7) B=\u22121.1I 1 V 1i s; and\u2003\u2003(8) C=V 1i 2 s+(sR 1 I 1 \u2212sV 1R)(I 1 R 1 \u2212V 1R).\u2003\u2003(9) V1i is the imaginary portion of the voltage and is a function of the amplitude of the power source voltage V1 and the sine of the power factor angle. V1R is the real portion of the voltage and is a function of the amplitude of the power source voltage V1 and the cosine of the phase angle. In addition, the equivalent resistance Re is given by the following equation: R e = sX e ( V 1 j - .05 I 1 X e ) ( V 1 R - I 1 R 1 ) . ( 10 )}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and have been described in detail herein. However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following appended claims. In addition, the monetary analysis module 222 may function cooperatively with or separately from the energy analysis module 220. In this exemplary embodiment, the monetary analysis module 222 comprises a cost analysis module 240 and a savings analysis module 242. For example, the cost analysis module 240 may calculate the monetary cost of the motor 20 based on the output power, the cost per kilowatt-hour, and the number of hours per week of operation of the motor 20. Similarly, the savings analysis module 242 may calculate the monetary cost of a new/replacement motor and then calculate the monetary difference between the new/replacement motor and the existing motor 20. As result, a customer can make an informed decision whether to replace the motor 20 with a new/replacement motor. Turning now to the energy and monetary analysis modules 220 and 222, the system 200 may engage these modules to evaluate",
