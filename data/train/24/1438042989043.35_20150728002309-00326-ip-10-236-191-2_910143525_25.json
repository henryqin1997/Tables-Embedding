    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70632=We have one dining hall- the caf along with a food court which (other than the mini Chick-fila) is operated by the University. You can get your own custom pizza, sandwich or burrito made there, and they have other specialty items ranging from parfait to sushi. You can essentially get whatever you want. The University gives you $130 a semester to spend in the food court, which never seems to be enough. The Caf isn't terrible but when you're a freshmen you have to buy a full plan- 19 meals a week which can be annoying. After that you can buy less and less depending on how many credits you've earned. Another annoying thing about the caf is the hours. On weekdays breakfast and lunch are from 7-930 am and then 1045-3. These aren't so bad, but if you want dinner it needs to be early. Sun-Thurs dinner is from 5-730, but if you want to eat in on the weekend you only have from 5-6 to eat, and they're not afraid to kick you out once they're closed., 80449=Every February, we have a campus-wide performance called Step Sing, which involves about 13 groups of about 70 people, who pick a theme and create a show (about seven minutes long) to go along with it. Past themes have been gold rushers, fairy tales, nightmares, Robin Hood, Harry Potter, and skeletons. It's so much fun! During exam weeks, there's a tradition of going outside the library at midnight and yelling for as long and as loud as possible, appropriately known as the Midnight Yell. People, especially seniors, like to jump into the fountains the night before graduation or sometime during exam week., 177026=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 136900=Step Sing--This song and dance show put on by students in the middle of February. Shows practice for a maximum of 40 hours, and put on hilarious and talented shows for three days. It is truly amazing., 131988=I love the food here! I wish they would give us more bulldog bucks though. The Caf doesn't serve breakfast on weekends so that is a little inconvenient. The food court also closes Friday evening around 4:00 and is closed on Sundays.}",

Tips for prospective students Be willing to try new things while at Samford. Keep an open mind and make your own college experience memorable by maintaining a good attitude in every situation. Invest in your friendships here, but keep in touch with the ones at home, too. Bang for the buck Samford University offers many opportunities to further my spiritual, physical, and intellectual well-being. I love the variety of activities it hosts such as intramurals, theatrical plays and musicals, concerts, university ministries, etc. The courses are hard, but I definitely feel better prepared from an academic standpoint. Am enjoying being here Being four hours away from my family is hard, but I have some great friends on campus that make it worthwhile. I really enjoy my professors who genuinely care about me and strive to help me succeed. Also, there are many fun activities and organizations on campus that keep me busy. Am learning a lot Because of the liberal arts education I am receiving, I have learned several ideas and",
