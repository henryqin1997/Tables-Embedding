They both offer a full range of classes and disciplines. John Tyler is a great school for Liberal Arts and Sciences as well as vocational training. They offer everything from African drum lessons to fashion design to hands-on mechanics classes to nursing degrees to real estate. I love the variety and the people are very nice and friendly. I highly recommend checking out John Tyler. Tips",
