            "Take Penn State Altoona seriously, even if you have graduated Altoona High and you are just going to PSU because it's in your hometown. Don't take it as a joke, and realize early that if you graduate from here, you get a Pennsylvania State University degree which will take you very far in life.",
            "This school is located in a beautiful part of Central Pennsylvania, close enough to the main campus so that students can participate in football games and other social activity while reaping the benefits of a smaller, quieter town. Classes are smaller resulting in more personal student-teacher relationships."

During this past summer of 2012 the cafeteria on campus was completely remodeled. It looks very modern, but most importantly the food is really good. There is a salad station, a pasta station, an all day breakfast food station, a sandwhich station, a grill station, a coffee/tea/milkshake station, a pizza station, and a chef's choice table., 87493=The food and dining at Penn State Altoona is not the best. Port Sky, the only cafeteria on campus, serves the same food every week and closes at 10:30 PM. There are no fast food restaurants on campus., 143745=When I first started college I gave birth to my 1st son in the middle of a semester. I had him on a Thursday and went back into school the following Tuesday to take a liver exam. I graduated with my Associates Degree in Nursing. I always stress to my children that education is never wasted. I decided about a year ago to go back for my BSN then on to my MSN. When I made this decision my oldest son was starting at PSU at University Park. I remember when I took him to college, he looked at me and laughed and said Here we are again mom in college together. My middle child will be starting college this fall in 2013. My youngest child age 16 is starting to make plans for when she graduates. She has 5 colleges she is interested in and would like to see one or two this summer. I raised my children with respect for education and to absorb all it has to offer because it will never be wasted. I currently work full time as a charge nurse for a hospital in my area. I have been attending PSU in Altoona and have maintained a 3.63 GPA. With over 18 years of experience in nursing I plan on getting my MSN and teach nursing., 230215=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
