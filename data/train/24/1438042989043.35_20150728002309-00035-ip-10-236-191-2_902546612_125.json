Because it is in the North, near Canada. Start bringing heavy winter jackets starting from October. April and May is the season for decent to humid weather conditions. It can get HOT. Do not expect snow days, unless the amount of snowfall accumulated is more than 6 inches or icy conditions occur. Be aware that roommates may not always be that friendly in the beginning. Do not succumb to peer pressure or group activities that do not engage your personality, you'll only hurt yourself in the end., 454069=The food is nothing special. There are 4 dining halls on the campus, one in each quadrant. These dining halls rotate the foods they serve daily and are open from around 7:30 am to 8:00 pm with the exception of one hall. I personally think closing the hall at 8:00 pm is a little to early but it's not entirely that bad. The campus center also has several dining options where you can get sub sandwiches, pizza slices, sushi, deli sandwiches, chinese, and mexican food depending on your meal plan. These places are open until 11:00 pm on weekdays so I always try to utilize these places to the best of my ability. The campus center food usually tastes better than the dining hall food. There is also a food market where you can purchase milk shakes, all sorts of beverages, freezer foods, dry foods like crackers, candy, and hot soup until late at night as well. The milk shakes are surprisingly good so I recommend trying those at least once. If you keep some snacks in your room for late a night, you shouldn't be too hungry most of the time.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck It's totally worth going to a SUNY school at pratically a fifth of the price of private colleges where you learn the same material as private schools and have similar learning styles where the teachers are amazing and absolutely helpful. Since it is a SUNY you know they aren't getting the best pay so obviously the teachers want to be there for you and to help you! Am enjoying being here It's a great school with great people, even people from all over the world. Am learning a lot Classes are a bit more difficult than high school, but you always learn something new in at least one class along with meeting new people.
