    "textBeforeTable": "This Monday morning, Renny Harlin will be riding around the streets of Los Angeles in a specially built car proclaiming, \u201cI have the Number One film in America! I am officially best!\u201d But it\u2019ll be a hollow victory. For his latest movie \u2013 The OC-meets-Harry-Potter blend of teen angst and superpowers known as The Covenant \u2013 has won the weekend, but it did so with just $9 million dollars. It\u2019s a win, but it\u2019s the lowest chart topper since David Spade\u2019s \u201ccomedy\u201d Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, which launched with $6.7 million three years ago. Let\u2019s see if word of mouth has an effect next week\u2026 Also arriving this weekend is what everyone\u2019s calling Ben Affleck\u2019s comeback, Hollywoodland. With Adrien Brody and Diane Lane featuring in the mystery of legendary TV Superman star George Reeves\u2019 death, the movie made $6 million and leaped several tall buildings to land in second place. The only other new opening this week was Tony Jaa\u2019s follow-up to Ong Bak, The Protector. It\u2019s faced some fan chatter about the US version arriving eviscerated courtesy of the Weinsteins, but it still looks like this second serving from Jaa isn\u2019t exactly as popular as his first. The movie made a relatively low $5 million and turned up in fourth. The rest of the charts sees a few slips and some films hanging on nicely. Invincible",
