The pernambuco forests of South America become alarmingly depleted. More professional musicians are using carbon fiber bows in addition to, and sometimes in place of, traditional wood bows. Why? Carbon fiber bows are much more durable than pernambuco bows, they resist warping, are priced economically (especially when compared with their wooden counterparts), and are often very light and well balanced. \u00a0 Comments on this bow: This Carbon bow belongs to the Top Model of YITAMUSIC Carbon fiber Bow Series. These bows offer exceptional performance, are highly responsive and project a most powerful, clear, rich warm tone. Only for professional players & serious players!",
