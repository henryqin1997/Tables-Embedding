If you can document the steps needed to build any of the combinations not marked in the table above, please send details. Purpose: Wrappers are fragments of \"glue code\" that allow functions or subroutines written in one language to be invoked by code written in another (\"target\") language. The WFDB library is a collection of specialized functions that provide uniform access to digitized signals and annotations in a wide variety of formats, including those in PhysioBank. The WFDB library is written in C and includes bindings for C++ and wrappers for Fortran. The wfdb-swig package provides wrappers that permit programs written in several other programming languages to use the WFDB library. The wrappers are generated automatically using the Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator (SWIG). Tested target languages include Perl5, Python, Java, and .NET languages (C# and Visual Basic). It may also be possible to generate wrappers for other languages supported by SWIG, including Guile, mzScheme, Octave, PHP, Ruby, and Tcl. Alternatives: The WFDB Toolkit for Matlab uses the Java wrappers from this package to provide efficient access to WFDB applications such as rdann, rdsamp, wrann, and wrsamp from the Matlab environment. One-click installation is possible; it is not necessary to have installed the wfdb-swig package beforehand. Raja Selvaraj is developing a pure Python module without external dependencies",
