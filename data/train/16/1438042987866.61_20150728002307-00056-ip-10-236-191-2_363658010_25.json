They were checks written to me, Christopher Hooley. The first one was $6200. The guy kept $5k and left $1200 in my account. The next one was a day later at a different center for $7500. Again, the guy kept $5k. I saw the debit slip online, and this guy\u2019s signature wasn\u2019t even a remote attempt to copy mine. To make matters worse, it turns out he was forging checks from another valley business, who subsequently called the police on ME!, 80968=Booked: 07-09-2008, 81002=Sex: MALE Race: WHITE D.O.B: 10-11-1975 Height: 5\u201909 Weight: 200 Eye: BROWN Hair: BLACK, 87786=The time has come to announced the winners for the 2008 SEO Superlatives.

    "textBeforeTable": "1. SEO Most Likely to Succeed Report: SEO Superlatives Summary \u2013 Compiled 07/04/08 As you\u2019ll see, the committe only chose one or two winners over the unfiltered voting results. And sorry Michael, but it\u2019s hard to believe you\u2019re more feared than Matt Cutts in the SEO world. Below are the unfiltered results of the vote. Despite attempts at altering the vote, much like Google we also had manual review. And much like Google, the popular vote still overpowered the spam for the most part, so the committee\u2019s job was pretty darn easy in that regard. There were more polls that only voted for one single person than completed surveys. IN all, half the votes were spam. HALF. Numerous nominees, especially in the categories for unknown or up and coming SEOs had bots voting themselves up in an almost embarrasingly traceable way. Same IP from nominee\u2019s city votes for self 100 times in an hour? yep. Lots of that. Rushes of voters from India, Russia, Malaysia, and Poland overnight? Some of that too. The winners were chosen almost 100% from the unfiltered voting results, allowing SEOs to game the voting system to the best of their abilities. And game they did. The Results Jason Gambert",
