From the corner, the woodwork was rattled by Alen Feti\u010d\u2019s fine drive. Italy rallied late in the half but Saad missed and Luca Leggiero was denied by Damir Pu\u0161kar., 77162=Having twice taken the lead, Slovenia made it 3-1 in the 39th minute when Igor Osredkar scored into an empty net. Saad pulled one back with 31 seconds left, but it was not enough for Italy and a draw against Azerbaijan on Friday will take Slovenia through., 78938=\u00a9UEFA.com 1998-2015. All rights reserved., 78075=Italy had come from behind to beat Slovenia in the first match of their 2003 finals success, but in that game they were already 2-1 up at half-time rather than trailing. Fortino had an early effort blocked by Pu\u0161kar but he beat the keeper at his near post in the 24th minute after a Gabriel Lima corner., 52601=28 January 2014, 78396=Slovenia immediately responded, \u010cujec of New Team FVG holding the ball about 12 metres out and smashing his shot past Mammarella. Pu\u0161kar did well to stop from Giasson, but Slovenia were also still launching attacks. Lima was tried as a flying goalkeeper in the last three minutes, but the empty net was found by Osredkar from deep in the Slovenia half. Saad responded but time ran out for Italy, now desperate for a result against Azerbaijan on Sunday., 88168=http://www.uefa.com/futsaleuro/season=2014/matches/round=2000398/match=2013042/postmatch/report/index.html#slovenia+shock+italy, 55965=29 January 2014, 66090=1 February 2014, 62678=31 January 2014, 59302=30 January 2014}",
