I can say I know that on campus living was new as of the 2011-2012 school year so I'm sure it would be exciting to be among the first to live in the new residence hall., 3523=If you plan on going to this college, it will be really great if you apply up for it in your early senior year after you get your SAT scores (if you took them early in the year). It will be a lot easier to apply, especially BEFORE summer. But since sigining up for the 30 scholarship's deadline is by March 1st this year, you might want to apply there in the winter., 4178=The proffesors here are really professional, and this school is not a community college anymore, they have raised up to a university system. They are going to be building dorms soon which will be finisheed by 2011. Recently I have gone to one of their seminars and it was thouroughly informitive. The college is really nice and the professors here are exceptional., 112156=There was an event held Fall 2012 that was a Humans v. Zombies week long event., 31103=this school has improved since i started back in 2009. becoming more involved with students. they have gotten more sports now and seems to be doing very well., 34686=The dining hall is EXCELLENT. I attended college back in 1999-2003 and the food then doesn't even hold a candle to what CCGA offers. The food is really good and the set up is amazing. It's all you can eat, open buffet style and you have 4 different areas to choose 4 different meals from plus a complete salad bar. Dining is new this year at CCGA and they have done an excellent job.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments What to do for fun there are lots of activities and programs you can do for fun within campus and lost of organization sto get involved with. off campus we are very close to the beach and that is what most of our students love to do. Food and Dining the dining hall is very convenient and has a wide variety of meals to offer students. some meals are better than others but they take all suggestions and comments and do something with them. they do not take a suggestion and leave it as a note on their desk. they take that suggestion and use it to better themselves, so that they can better serve use students. Dorm Life the residence life and housing staff here at ccga are phenomenal. they do erverything they can to help the residential students get involved, stay invovled and succeed academically. i love living in the residence halls. Academic Rigor i am a student in the bachelors of business administration program and i continually see the courses getting harder, but that also means i continue to get more out of them. you get out of classes what you",
