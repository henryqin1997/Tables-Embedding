Kincade \r\ngave Colorado an early Christmas present.\r\n\r\nKincade's interception in the end zone sealed Missouri's 17-14\r\novertime victory over Iowa State and sent Colorado to next\r\nweek's Big 12 championship game against Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nIowa State (6-5, 4-4 Big 12 North) could have clinched the\r\ndivision with a victory.  Instead, Colorado won a tiebreaker\r\nover the Cylones and will represent the division in the Big 12\r\ntitle game despite a .500 record in the conference.\r\n\r\nAfter Adam Crossett's 25-yard field goal gave Missouri (5-6, 3-5\r\nNorth) the lead on the first possession of overtime, Iowa State\r\nwas in position for the winning score, reaching a 1st-and-goal\r\nat the 3.\r\n\r\nBut two running plays by Stevie Hicks resulted in a loss of\r\nthree yards.  On third down, Kincade stepped in front of Bret\r\nMeyer's pass intended for Jon Davis, snapping Missouri's\r\nfour-game losing streak.\r\n\r\nOn the first play of Iowa's overtime possession, a wide-open Ben\r\nBarkema dropped a sure touchdown pass.\r\n\r\nThe Cyclones could have taken the lead late in the fourth\r\nquarter, but Bret Culbertson badly missed a 24-yard field goal\r\nto the right with 1:02 left.\r\n\r\nMeyer completed 16-of-28 passes for 206 yards and rushed for 61\r\nyards and a TD on 20 carries for the Cyclones, who erased\r\ndeficits of 7-0 and 14-7.  Iowa tied the contest, 14-14, on\r\nHicks' two-yard TD with 8:58 left in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nBrad Smith completed 13-of-24 passes for 150 yards for Missouri.\r\nHe also ran for 101 yards on 21 carries, including a 36-yard\r\nscamper that gave the Tigers a 14-7 lead with 5:48 left in the\r\nthird.}",
