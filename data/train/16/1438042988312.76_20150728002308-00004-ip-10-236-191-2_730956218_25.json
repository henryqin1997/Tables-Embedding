While delayed, John meets an Argentinean girl named Manuela (Pedraza), who helps him to learn authentic style Tango. * Features: Robert Duvall's real life fascination with tango finds its expression in this labor of love, a film he wrote, directed, and stars in. Not many people know that Robert Duvall is an avid dancer and hobbyist. West Coast Swing and especially the dance he loves the most 'Argentine Tango' are his favorite dances long before this film was made. \"No one is more dangerous than the man who lives two lives\" Assassination Tango",
