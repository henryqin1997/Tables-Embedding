            "BEAM DEFLECTOR, LIGHT SCANNING UNIT AND IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS HAVING THE SAME - A beam deflector having a base, the beam deflector including a polygon mirror to reflect a light beam, a mirror driving unit including a rotor shaft erected from the base and a rotor to support the polygon mirror and to rotate about the rotor shaft, a friction member to contact with and be separated from the rotor so as to obstruct and release rotation of the rotor, respectively, and a friction member driving unit to drive the friction member.",
            "Semiconductor laser diode, printhead including the diode, and image forming apparatus including the diode - Provided are a semiconductor laser diode, and a printhead and an image forming apparatus including the semiconductor laser diode. The semiconductor laser diode includes a concave-convex pattern, and emits light having a Gaussian light intensity distribution. High quality images are provided by applying the semiconductor laser diode to a printhead and an image forming apparatus.",
            "Polygon mirror assembly, light scanning unit employing polygon mirror assembly, and image forming apparatus - A polygon mirror assembly, a light scanning unit employing the polygon mirror assembly, and an image forming apparatus. The polygon mirror assembly includes a polygon mirror formed of a plastic material and having a plurality of reflection surfaces; and a motor unit to support and rotate the polygon mirror, where the polygon mirror is coupled to the motor unit by using an adhesive material.",
            "Polygonal mirror, light scanning unit using the polygonal mirror, and image forming apparatus - A polygonal mirror, a light scanning unit using the polygonal mirror, and an image forming apparatus. The polygonal mirror is formed of a plastic and includes a plurality of reflection surfaces that are formed in an outer portion of the polygonal mirror and rotate around a rotational axis, and an internal mirror surface that defines a hole, wherein a ratio of an internal diameter d to an outer diameter D satisfies 0.1\u2266d/D\u22660.3.",
            "WEIGHT-BALANCED POLYGONAL MIRROR, LIGHT SCANNING UNIT USING THE POLYGONAL MIRROR, AND IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS - A light scanning unit includes a light source to emit a light beam; a polygonal mirror to deflect the light beam in a main scanning direction; and an imaging optical system to image the light beam onto a scanning surface. The polygonal mirror includes a plurality of reflection surfaces that are formed in an outer portion of the polygonal mirror and rotate around a rotational axis and an internal mirror surface that defines a hole. A ratio of an internal diameter d to an outer diameter D satisfies 0.1\u2266d/D\u22660.3. The polygonal mirror is adhered to a motor unit that supports and rotates the polygonal mirror, using an adhesive. The internal mirror surface of the polygonal mirror defining the hole is point-bonded to the motor unit using the adhesive, and the point-bonding is conducted in a direction toward a corner of the reflection surfaces.",
