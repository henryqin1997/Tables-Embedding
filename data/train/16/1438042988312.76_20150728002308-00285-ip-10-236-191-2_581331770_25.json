    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{412005=The analyses in this paper are based on data sets from Curtin University's permanent GNSS stations and series of zero-baseline experiments. The first data set is from Curtin's permanent GNSS antennas (CUT00 and CUTA0) mounted on the roof of building 402 at the campus of Curtin University in Perth, Australia (Figure 1a). These antennas are connected to six BeiDou-enabled receivers, as summarised in Figure 1b, consisting of three Trimble NETR9, two Javad TRE_G3T DELTA and a Septentrio POLARx4 receivers. We considered the data from these receivers for five days from April 4 to 8, 2013. BeiDou satellite visibility for April 4 is shown in Figure 2. The data of various zero baselines for five days with a 30 s sampling interval is used to estimate ISTBs in Section 4.2, while the data of various short baselines between CUT00 and CUTA0 on April 7 with a 1 s sampling interval is used to analyse the impact of ISTBs on attitude determination in Section 4.3., 413138=In addition to the data from Curtin's permanent stations, we also carried out a series of zero-baseline experiments: two in an open space in Curtin University and another two in an open space in Kalamunda, Western Australia (about 17 km from Curtin University), each for three consecutive days (Table 2). As shown in Figure 3b, a single antenna (Figure 3a) was connected to two BeiDou-enabled receivers (Trimble NETR9 and Javad Javad TRE G3T DELTA). Figure 4 shows the visibility of BeiDou satellites on April 19, 2013. These zero-baseline data sets (with a 30 s sampling interval) are also used to estimate and validate ISTBs in Section 4.2. The stochastic model parameters of the elevation-dependent model Equation (29) for the receivers are reported in Table 3. Since the receivers, except Trimble NETR9, track only B1 and B2 signals, single- and dual-frequency analyses are considered in the paper., 584916=\u00a9 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The first two columns are for ISTBs of GEO and MEO satellite types with an IGSO satellite as the reference, while the last column is for MEO ISTBs with respect to GEO satellites. Similar results for Curtin's open space experiment are given in Figure 9, matching with the results of the same receiver pair (Trimble-Javad) in Figure 7 and 8. The gaps in the MEO-related time series are due to the unavailability of visible MEO satellites during those periods., 17546=Sensors 2013, 13(7), 9435-9463; doi:10.3390/s130709435}",
