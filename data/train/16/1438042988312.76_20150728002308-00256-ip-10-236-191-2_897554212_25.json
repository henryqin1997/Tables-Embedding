    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{31895=After negotiations, the PDS and WASG agreed on terms for a combined ticket to compete in the 2005 federal election and pledged to unify into a single left-wing party during 2007. According to the pact, the parties did not compete against each another in any district. Instead, WASG candidates\u2014including the former SPD leader, Oskar Lafontaine\u2014were nominated on the PDS electoral list. To symbolise the new relationship, the PDS changed its name to The Left Party.PDS (Linkspartei.PDS) or simply The Left.PDS, with the letters \"PDS\" optional in western states where many voters still regarded the PDS with suspicion., 40877=The party was isolated ahead of the 2012 presidential election, as the government invited SPD and Greens, but not Die Linke, to agree on an all-party consensus candidate for President. The CDU/CSU and FDP government parties, and the SPD and the Greens, eventually agreed on Joachim Gauck, the SPD's and the Greens' preferred candidate. Die Linke again refused to support him.[22] The SPD chairman, Sigmar Gabriel, criticized Die Linke and claimed the reason for the party's rejection of Gauck was its \"sympathy for the German Democratic Republic.\"[23][24] On 11 April 2012 the chairwoman of the party, Gesine L\u00f6tzsch, declared her resignation as a chairwoman of the party.[25], 126973=In Hesse, state SPD leader Andrea Ypsilanti sought to form a minority government with the Greens, which would have required the support of The Left's new parliamentary group despite a campaign promise not to cooperate with The Left. This would have been the first time that The Left formed any alliance with a government in a western state. The SPD and Left state organisations ratified an agreement that guaranteed The Left's acceptance of an SPD-Green government which Left deputies would support with their votes. The move was controversial in the SPD. Some of the party's representatives in parliament rejected cooperation with a party they considered extremist. After months of debate, the proposed government was scheduled to be brought to a vote in the Hessian Landtag on 4 November 2008. On the eve of the vote, four SPD deputies broke with party discipline and declared they would vote against Ypsilanti, effectively blocking an SPD-led government.[47] As a result, new elections did take place in January 2009. Ypsilanti stepped down as the SPD's chief candidate, and she has been replaced by party deputy Thorsten Sch\u00e4fer-G\u00fcmbel.[48][49] In this election the Linke gained 0.3% on the result one year earlier (now 5.4%), staying in parliament (the SPD lost 13%, the Greens gained 6.2%)[50], 58050=On 3 October 2007, during a commemoration ceremony[44] in the Saxon Parliament in memory of the German reunification and the fall of the German Democratic Republic, all members of The Left walked out in protest. The Left was upset that Joachim Gauck, the former Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records and later President of Germany, was invited to deliver a speech.[45], 126021=After the May 2007 election Bremen, a joint PDS-WASG ticket was able to form a parliamentary group for the first time in a western state.[46] After the PDS-WASG merger, The Left continued to make gains in what was the western Germany, entering the state parliaments in Lower Saxony, Hesse, Hamburg and recently in North Rhine-Westphalia, 34374=In spite of all this, in the 2005 elections the Left Party became the fourth largest party in the Bundestag with 8.7% of the nationwide vote and 53 seats. Negotiations on unification between Left Party. PDS and WASG continued through the next year until the two forces reached agreement on 27 March 2007. The joint party\u2014now called simply \"The Left\"\u2014celebrated its founding congress on 16 June in Berlin., 26608=In the first all-German Bundestag elections in 1990, the PDS won only 2.4% of the nationwide vote. Normally, a party must win at least five percent of the vote to qualify for proportional representation in the Bundestag. However, for the 1990 elections only, a one-time exception allowed eastern-based parties to qualify for list representation if they won at least five percent of the vote in the former East Germany. Also, Gysi was elected from a Berlin-area district; representatives elected directly through the \"First Vote\" are always guaranteed a seat regardless of their party's national vote. As a result, the PDS entered the 1990 Bundestag with 17 deputies led by Gysi, albeit without the privileges afforded to parliamentary groups., 51970=In 2001, Gabi Zimmer, the head of the Left Party's predecessor PDS at the time, officially recognized the injustice of building the Berlin wall in 1961, but she did not feel compelled to apologize on behalf of the Party.[33], 13655=According to official party figures, the Left Party had 63,784 registered members as of December 2013,[11] making it the fourth-largest party in Germany.[12], 129302=In October 2008 the Left Party nominated Tatort actor and activist Peter Sodann as their candidate for the 2009 presidential election.[51] Since the German president is chosen by the Bundesversammlung, consisting of all members of the Bundestag and an equal number of Bundesrat-selected delegates, Sodann did not win but he got 91 of the 1223 votes cast (The Left had 90 delegates)., 36686=The electoral collapse of the Social Democratic Party in the federal election on 27 September 2009 gave The Left an unprecedented opportunity to increase its influence in German politics. The party's vote surged to 11.9 percent, increasing its representation in the Bundestag from 54 to 76 seats. It remains the second largest opposition party., 28713=In 1998, the party reached its highest result so far by seeing 37 deputies elected with 5.1% of the national vote, thus surpassing the 5% threshold required for guaranteed representation and full parliamentary status in the Bundestag. Gysi's resignation in 2000 after losing a policy debate with leftist factions brought conflict to the PDS. In the 2002 federal election, the party's share of the vote declined to 4.0% and the PDS was represented only by two backbenchers elected directly from their districts, Petra Pau and Gesine L\u00f6tzsch., 23222=By the time of a special congress in December 1989, the party was no longer a Marxist\u2013Leninist party, though neo-Marxist and communist minority factions continue to exist. At the congress, the party adopted a program of democratic reform. To distance the reformed party from the SED's communist ideology, the party added the words \"Party of Democratic Socialism\" to its name, finally dropping the words \"Socialist Unity Party\" in February 1990. Gysi remained as leader., 27665=In the 1994 federal election the PDS managed to increase its share of the vote to 4.4 percent. This was in spite of an aggressive \"Red Socks\" campaign organised against the PDS by the then-ruling Christian Democratic Union aimed at scaring off voters by insinuating that underneath their suits, representatives of the PDS were \"still wearing red socks\" and harboring \"red\", i.e. communist, convictions. More importantly, Gysi and three other candidates were elected from eastern electoral districts. Parties with at least three directly-elected seats enter the Bundestag with their full contingent of representatives corresponding to the party's popular vote count, even if it falls short of the normal five percent threshold. This allowed the PDS to re-enter the Bundestag with an enlarged caucus of 30 deputies., 42421=In the 2014 European parliament elections, The Left received 7.4% of the national vote, returning 7 MEPs.[26] After the election in Th\u00fcringen of the state parliament Bodo Ramelow was the first \"Ministerpr\u00e4sident\" of the party. He was voted by the SPD and the Alliance 90/The Greens too., 37498=Ahead of the 2010 presidential election, Social Democrats and Greens invited the Left to vote for their candidate, Joachim Gauck. They proposed the election of the civil rights activist and former Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records as a possibility for the Left to leave their communist past behind them and show unconditional support for democracy.[14] Die Linke refused to support either Gauck, or conservative Christian Wulff, the favourite of the chancellor,[15] but put forward their own nominee, television journalist Luc Jochimsen.[16] The Left declared it impossible to vote for Gauck, as he had supported the German commitment in the Afghan War and had attacked the post-communists.[17] The red-green camp reacted disappointed.[18] SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel described Die Linke's position as \"bizarre and embarrassing,\" stating that he was \"shocked\" that the party would declare Joachim Gauck their main enemy due to his investigation of communist injustice.[19] According to Gabriel, Die Linke had manifested itself once again as the successor of the East German communist party.[20] Social Democrats and Greens expected the Left to support Gauck at least in the decisive third round of the election. But after Jochimsen had withdrawn, most Left electoral delegates abstained.[18][20] Wulff was elected by an absolute majority.[21], 29475=After the 2002 debacle, the PDS adopted a new, moderate program and installed long-time Gysi ally Lothar Bisky as chairman. In the 2004 elections to the European Parliament, the PDS won 6.1% of the vote nationwide, its highest share at that time in a federal election. Its electoral base in the eastern German states continued to grow, until it ranked as the third strongest party in the east, behind the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). However, low membership and voter support in Germany's western states continued to plague the party until it formed an electoral alliance in July 2005 with the newly formed Electoral Alternative for Labour and Social Justice (WASG), a party largely consisting of dissident Social Democrats, trade union members, and an assortment of left-wing radicals., 11462=Since mid-2012, its co-chairs have been Katja Kipping and Bernd Riexinger. In the Bundestag the party has 64 out of 630 seats after polling 8.6% of the vote in the 2013 federal elections.[5] Its parliamentary group is therefore the third largest among the four groups in the German Bundestag, and the leading opposition group. Internationally, The Left is a member of the Party of the European Left and is the largest party in the European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) group in the European Parliament., 21351=The Peaceful Revolution that forced the dismissal of East German Communist leader Erich Honecker in October 1989 also empowered a younger generation of reformist politicians in East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) who looked to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika as their model for political change. Reformers like longtime SED politician Hans Modrow, attorney Gregor Gysi and dissidents like Rudolf Bahro and Stefan Heym soon began to reconstruct that party that had long been known as one of the most rigidly Stalinist parties in the Soviet bloc. The party gave up its monopoly of power on December 1, 1989. Honecker's successor, Egon Krenz, resigned two days later, and Gysi was named party chairman. By the end of 1989, the last hardline members of the party's Central Committee had either resigned or been pushed out. They were followed in 1990 by 95% of the SED's 2.3 million members., 52837=Germany operates a system of \"Verfassungsschutz\" (Protection of the Constitution) at both federal level (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz, BfV) and state level (Landesbeh\u00f6rden f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz, LfV), which carries out domestic surveillance of actual and suspected activities which may threaten the \"free and democratic basic order\" (\"freiheitlich-demokratische Grundordnung\") at the core of the German constitution. The Left Party, including one third of its members of parliament,[34] and some of its caucuses remain under observation by the BfV, listed in the annual Verfassungsschutzbericht under the heading \"left-extremist tendencies and suspected cases\". The 2007 report cites as evidence of the party's \"extremism\" Lothar Bisky's June 2007 statement that democratic socialism remains the party's goal: \"We also still discuss the change of property and power relations.... We question the system.\" However, the report notes that in practice the parliamentary party appears as to act as a \"reform-oriented\" left force. In addition, the report cites \"openly extremist groupings\" within the party, notably the Marxist\u2013Leninist Communist Platform, which in Sahra Wagenknecht has a representative on the 44-member Left Party executive.[35] One former Bundestag deputy, Bodo Ramelow, was under BfV surveillance until a court decision in January 2008 that the observation was illegal.[36][37], 56557=In January 2012, it became known that more than one third of the party's MPs were observed by the federal Verfassungsschutz due to suspected extremist views.[40][41] This was ruled to be unconstitutional by the BVerfG in 2013.[42] Subsequently Federal Minister of the interior Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re declared in 2014 that no Bundestag members of the Left would be under surveillance by the BfV from then on, even if they are members of the Communist Platform or comparable extreme Left factions.[43], 35295=A string of electoral successes followed in the \"Super Election Year\" of 2009. In the campaign for seats in the European Parliament, The Left party won 7.5% of the vote nationwide, continuing a steady upward trend in European elections (1994: 4.7%, 1999: 5.8%, 2004: 6.1%). In six state elections, the party either surged ahead or consolidated earlier gains, increasing its vote in Thuringia and Hesse, and winning seats for the first time in Schleswig Holstein. In Saarland, the party became a significant force for the first time in a western state, winning 19.2% of the vote and taking third place ahead of the Free Democratic Party and the Greens. In Saxony and Brandenburg, the party's vote declined slightly while it remained the second largest political force in both states., 50022=The party has a mixed stance towards the recent Ukraine crisis. Gregor Gysi has described Russia as \"state capitalist\", and the party has called Russia annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine \"illegal\". However, Gysi has noted that \"older\" elements of the party have a strong penchant for Russia and the Soviet Union. [30] The party declared in May 2014 that Ukraine shouldn't receive any kind of support from Germany as long as it is ruled by \"fascists\".[31] A number of party members have been very supportive of Russian interests, and deputies of the party supported and observed the referendum held by the population of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea., 125250=Until 2007, the former Party of Democratic Socialism was represented only in the state parliaments of eastern Germany and Berlin, including Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia., 43727=The Left aims for democratic socialism in order to overcome capitalism. As a platform for left politics in the wake of globalization, The Left includes many different factions, ranging from communists to social democrats. In March 2007, during the joint party convention of Left Party and WASG, a document outlining political principles was agreed on. The official program of the party was decided upon by an overwhelming majority at the party conference in October 2011 in Erfurt, Thuringia., 23894=On 18 March 1990, the PDS faced the voters in 1990 East German election, the first (and as it turned out, only) free election in East Germany. As expected, the party did poorly, coming in a distant third with only 16.4% of the vote, behind the East German branches of the West German-based Christian Democratic Union and Social Democratic Party. The two major parties formed a grand coalition, led by the Alliance for Germany, built around the East German branch of the West German Christian Democratic Union, which meant the PDS was the main opposition party., 55364=The Left is also under observation by four western CDU/CSU-governed states, where party in its entirety is considered to be extremist (Lower Saxony, Hesse, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria).[38] Saarland ceased observation of The Left in January 2008.[37] By contrast, in the five eastern states The Left is not under surveillance, with the local LfVs seeing no indication of anti-constitutional behaviour of the party as a whole. However the small \"Communist Platform\" \u2014 a hardline communist minority faction within the party \u2014 is under observation in three eastern states.[39], 128978=The Left contested an election in Bavaria for the first time in the September 2008 Bavaria state election. It garnered 4.3 percent of the vote, just short of the 5 percent necessary to win seats in the Landtag., 9915=The Left (German: Die Linke), also commonly referred to as the Left Party (German: Linkspartei), is a democratic socialist[4] political party in Germany. The party was founded in 2007 as the merger of the post-communist Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), successor to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) that ruled East Germany until 1989, and the Electoral Alternative for Labour and Social Justice (WASG), a left-wing breakaway from the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).}",
