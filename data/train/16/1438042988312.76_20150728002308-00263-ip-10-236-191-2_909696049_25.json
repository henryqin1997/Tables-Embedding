    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students HCC is great for students who do not know what to major in. The liberal arts program at HCC is a great start for any indecisive college student. Tips for prospective students Make sure to tour the campus before your classes start. Also, parking can get pretty ridiculous so leave your house early to get a good spot. Bang for the buck HCC is pretty affordable, financial aid helps though. Am enjoying being here HCC have great clubs to join and awesome events. Just recently the music majors had a Jazz concert for all to go. The environment is warm and friendly. I have made so many new friends from my classes. Am learning a lot The professors are great, every one I had were very helpful and taught well. I am a photography major and the photo professors are such special people, I am so happy I went to HCC first to learn from them. Every photography major there come out pros in the Dark Room when they leave. Login to",
