            "All datasets obtained by NGDC were converted to common horizontal and vertical datums of WGS84 geographic and Mean High Water, respectively, using FME. They were also converted to common file format, ESRI point shapefiles, for visualization and inspection.",
            "Datasets were visually inspected with ArcGIS for identification and editing of data anomalies. Datasets were then compared with overlapping datasets to ensure data consistency.",
            "Satellite imagery of three areas with recent, significant morphologic change were converted to estimated depths.",
            "xyz files of the bathymetric data were surfaced using GMT's 'surface' tool onto a 1 arc-second grid that interpolated to fill empty cells. Points extracted every 10 meters along the coastline were also included to ensure that the bathymetric grid reached zero at the coast. The resulting Arc ASCII grid was imported into ArcGIS and clipped to the coastline to remove values over land.",
            "xyz files for each input dataset were gridded using MB-System's 'mbgrid' tool, which utilizes a high-tension spline interpolation method to fill grid cells with no input elevation values. Preferential weighting was given to more recent, higher-accuracy datasets. Gridding was performed in quadrants, each with a 5% data buffer. The grids were imported in ArcGIS and seamlessly merged to create the final DEM.",
            "The DEM was quantitatively evaluated by comparing with source datasets and with elevation values extracted from NGS geodetic monuments. It was visually evaluated by converting to UTM-zone coordinates (units of meters horizontally and vertically) and then creating a slope grid to identify gridding artifacts in the DEM."
