            "love the small close atmosphere. love the outdoors and fresh air and really want to excel in school.",
            "drill field- used by the corps on campus for drill every monday. you can't walk across it to get to class but you can lay on it or use it for gatherings/ intramural/ school functions. cannon- the cannon goes off every afternoon at 5pm sharp.",
            "i think you get the education of a big name school but with smaller size classes in which teachers care about you.",

For the amount of money you pay the dining is terrible., 267713=You would never expect to have noisy neighbors at 3 o'clock in the morning on a Thursday, but, unfortunately, it happens. Noisy neighbors may be my biggest complaint about the dorm life at North Georgia, but that is easily manageable if you have an efficient R.A. that can handle those kinds of issues., 564541=The entire campus is centered around the drill field which is where the core of cadets, and other organization will meet. It is open to the entire campus, however, never ever walk across the drill field as a short cut. You can be on the drill field throwing Frisbee or having a picnic, but never use it as a means to make a shorter walk. We are a Military college so every evening at 5:00 PM the Core of Cadets shoot off a cannon, everyone on campus stops walking, and driving to pay their respect., 138619=Reveille at 0700 Retreat at 1700, 486899=At 5 o'clock p.m. every day, the loud speakers, that cover all of campus with their noise, plays taps and revelee as the American Flag is retired for the night. At this time, all cars, pedestrians, and everyone stop in their tracks and respect the ceremony. It truly sets our university apart from others., 446254=If you want to do well in any college make sure you don't ever let yourself fall behind. You will have plenty of time for social occasions as long as you don't spend too much of your free time watching tv and videos on the internet rather than reading and studying. Get involved right away. If you want to play intramural sports, DO NOT take night classes as late as 5:30 or 7. On the weekends, a lot of kids go home but it is very peaceful if you aren't a huge fan of crowds in the first place., 619838=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 190338=North Georgia is a military so we do have traditions we follow strictly. At 5 O'clock everyday the cannon goes off and all are to stand and remain silent as the flag American Flag is retired for the day. At midnight, Taps is played as a signal for all ROTC to return to the dorms. At the center of the college is the drill field. It is forbidden to cross the drill field in order to try and save time to get to class., 459393=This is a military college, so every morning the ROTC fires a cannon at 7:00am and again at 5:00 in the afternoon. When the army band plays and the cannon is fired, students are expected to stop and turn in direction of the flag., 228067=The canon fires in the mornings to signal the start of the day and everyone has to freeze, stop cars, stop everything at 5 o'clock when the flag is taken down, the bugle sounds and the canon fires everyday., 517756=No one is allowed to take a shortcut across the drill field. You will be tackled by cadets if you do. Everyday at 7:15 am and 5:00 pm, if you are outside, you must stop and face the flag. No matter where you walk, you will be going uphill., 66535=The Corps of Cadets observes reveille and retreat at 0700 and 1700 everyday. You can't cut across the Drill Field to get to class faster. There is a candle light ceremony on the drill field every 9/11 involving both cadets and civilian students.}",

As a military cadet, you will have hardly any freedom and you will be living in barracks - not dorms. Do not expect first class. But do expect good people, good prices, good professors, and a great education. Plus we have new apartments and the school is in the process of building new dorms, barracks, and chow hall (all before I graduate in 2013). I highly recommend NGCSU. Go Saints! Bang for the buck NGCSU is an excellent education for an excellent price. Most students receive sufficient funding. Am enjoying being here I enjoy my civilian life at NGCSU. Honestly, I do not LOVE the Corps of",
