UIUC Call Number: Oak Street Facility 491.81 Ob61, 94742=This title is the standard Bulgarian scholarly dictionary produced by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. In 2001 a second, revised edition began publication in spite of the fact that the first edition was never finished. As of 2002 the first edition has eleven volumes out of a projected twenty covering up through the letter O. As of 2002 only two volumes of the second edition have appeared covering up through the letter V (Cyrillic alphabetical order). In 2006, the third volume was published, covering G - Deiatel. These dictionaries present the modern Bulgarian lexicon from the second quarter of the 19th century through the present day. The goal is comprehensive coverage of words and definitions with substantial coverage of usage in special phrases and expressions. For a more scholarly annotation of this dictionary see the entry for it in Entsiklopediia na suvremenniia bulgarski ezik annotated above. Like most standard, scholarly dictionaries this one provides not only definitions but also some grammatical forms and excerpts from literature to show usage. The first volumes in both editions contain the extremely long list of sources including the literary texts used to establish the definitions and usage. See the entry on the left for the word \"Bairam\" from volume 1 of the first edition., 70957=Onomastics is a branch of linguistics that studies various types of names. These three bibliographies present citations for both books and articles related to Bulgarian names and works of Bulgarian scholars on onomastics that do not necessarily concern Bulgaria. The slim volume covering 1960-1970 has been superseded by the one encompassing 1940-1970. The two larger volumes are arranged according to similar schemes: general works, bibliographies, congresses, the Bulgarian language, Slavic languages, Indo-European languages, non-Indo-European languages, reviews. Within these broader categories there are smaller subjects delineated such as geographic names, onomastics and ethnography, personal names, etc. Many of the entries have a brief annotation explaining what kind of names are discussed in the work and from what area these names come. There are indexes for authors and names of all kinds. See the citations below from the general section of the 1971-1980 volume., 74841=This book combines a review of research in the area of Bulgarian syntax with a bibliography. Various topics are discussed and citations for relevant works are included within each discussion. Some topics include an overview of the development of linguistic Bulgaristika, the Academy grammar, Maslov's 1981 grammar, morphosyntax, children's speech, etc. A full bibliography of works arranged by author is appended at the conclusion of the discussions. The works are for both books and articles published in Bulgaria, other European countries and North America. Note the citations below which are from the bibliography., 45697=With coverage of the years 1824-1900 this retrospective bibliography in an excellent source for locating books, textbooks, articles and reviews written in Bulgarian about linguistics. Every item included in this bibliography (over 1200 of them) was examined in person (de visu) by the compiler. All of the citations\u00a0 are arranged into four main groups: general topics, the Bulgarian language, other languages, language learning/textbooks. Within each of these four groups the items are further subdivided by subjects such as dialectology, etymology, onomastics, and by individual languages as subjects. In addition to full bibliographic citations the entries also provide a one-line annotation on the content. The bibliography is equipped with an index for names, a list of sources, and many see references. The table of contents at the end elucidates the subject arrangement of the citations in the volume.

Annually it publishes hundreds of citations for books, articles, and reviews arranged in different ways depending on the years of the bibliography. Earlier it was a strict author arrangement, but later the citations were grouped by subjects with an author index. The table below gives the citations for each installment of the bibliography.

The first half of the volume lists citations for articles, books, and reviews on the topic, while the second half lists actual Bulgarian phrases and refers the user to the works that discuss them. The citations are arranged into three groups (dictionaries, books, articles/reviews) and then by author with the author's name in bold face. The phrases are organized by significant word. Finally, there is an alphabetical index of complete phrases which also refers the user to the works that contain them. See the image below for some citations in the phrase index., 77944=One of the main bibliographies of foreign linguistic Bulgaristika is produced annually in serialized form in the journal Bulgarski ezik. Details are given below. Of course, the main bibliography for Bulgaristika is Bulgariia v chuzhdata literatura, series 7 of the Bulgarian national bibliography, and its precursors. It has sections devoted to linguistics. An example of a bibliography found as part of a collection of Bulgaristika is on pages 334-359 of the book Ezikovedskata Bulgaristika v Chekhoslovakiia. Sofiia: Nauka i izkustvo, 1987., 42056=Resources found on this page include works about Bulgarian language/ linguistics regardless of the language of publication and works about linguistics in general that are published in Bulgarian. Resources about Slavic linguistics or other Slavic languages that are published in Bulgarian will appear on the pages devoted to the individual languages or the General Resources for Slavic Linguistics page. Cross references are provided for works that could be listed under multiple categories. Also, please note that there are two special sections on the page for General Resources for Slavic Linguistics that are particularly relevant for Bulgarian, South Slavic and Balkanistika. Works on the \"Old Bulgarian\" language will be found on the page concerning Old Church Slavic/Church Slavic. Scholars interested in Macedonian linguistics may also find some of these early resources useful as Macedonian was not formally declared a language independent of Bulgarian and Serbian until 1944. As is true for all of the pages in this guide, clicking on either portraits or names of bibliographers and authors will lead to their biographical data., 45474=Konstantinova, Violeta.

UIUC Call Number: Main Stacks 491.817 M987r, 66081=This atypical bibliography is devoted to works on Bulgarian/Macedonian dialectology. It is atypical in that it does not provide citations to books or articles, but rather helps to locate dialect texts such as proverbs, songs, stories, words, etc. that appear within various books or journals. The list of sources is a helpful guide to sources about dialectology except when it just lists journals that were consulted without giving individual article citations. It contains over 1700 citations for locating texts related to a particular dialect or village. The citations are arranged alphabetically by village or place of dialect without article titles or authors' names, but they do provide detailed page references and indications of the genre of text found on each page as well as the village districts in brackets. There are indexes for places and genres. You must use the abbreviation key to sources to understand the citations. Since this work was compiled before Macedonian was officially declared a language it is also extremely useful for the study of Macedonian dialectology. It contains many villages and districts located in the current territory of Macedonia (FYROM). See the citations below for works on the town of Krushovo.

UIUC Call Number: Main Stacks 491.81 B872i v.1-26, 106768=Grammars often appear in library catalogs with subject headings such as Bulgarian language--Grammar. Specialized grammars sometimes further delineate this subject heading with additional terms such as \"History\" or \"Comparative.\" Try some of these headings in WorldCat or in your online catalog to find other Bulgarian grammars. You should also consider looking at language textbooks since most of them have grammatical explanations. Many of them can also be found with the same subject heading. For an annotated bibliography of Slavic grammars and dictionaries published before 1850, see Stankiewicz which is described in the Sources for Dictionaries and Language Resources section of this course. Many Bulgarian titles are included in this work. There is also a list of Bulgarian grammars, including modern ones, at the back of Entsiklopediia na suvremenniia bulgarski ezik., 98713=This dictionary and its 1971 revision are the standard etymological dictionaries for the Bulgarian language. Scholars at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences compiled and revised both editions. To date neither edition has been completed, but the University of Illinois also lacks the latest volume. Volume 6 of the later edition published in 2002 goes up through the word Slovar'. The entries provide a definition in Bulgarian, a posited derivation, forms of the word in other languages including other Slavic languages as well as citations to the sources in which these forms were found. Dialectal forms are also mentioned. The first volume of the 1971 edition opens with a long bibliography of sources. See the entry below showing the derivation of the word \"bankrut\" or bankruptcy., 43888=One of the standard sources for Bulgarian bibliography, the annual Bibliografiia na bulgarskata bibliografiia, is very helpful for finding bibliographies of Bulgarian linguistics. One of its sections is devoted to \"Ezikoznanie\". See the page on Bulgarian Bibliographies of Bibliographies for annotations and call numbers for this publication and two retrospective bibliographies of bibliographies with coverage going back to 1852. These sources cover not only bibliographies that were published as monographs, but also ones that appeared in journals. Thus, for example, citations for the many specialized linguistic bibliographies that were printed in the journal Bulgarski ezik can be found here., 100220=Ilchev, Stefan; Ivanova, Ana, et al.

It has citations for both articles and books. In earlier years the citations are arranged by author's surname, in later years by broad subject categories. In later years the title was changed to \"Bulgaristikata v chuzhdata ezikovedska periodika prez ...g.\" and ceases to cover book titles. Some of the bibliographies contain supplements for previous years and author indexes.

Morfologiia -- tom 3. Sintaksis. Volume One opens with a brief overview of notable Bulgarian grammars and then launches into phonetics, the subject of the volume. The subject matter is divided into sections typical for the topic - vowels, consonants, stress, intonation, etc. and every section has a number of examples from Bulgarian to illustrate the points. There is a very detailed table of contents at the end of the volume, but no index. UIUC lacks Volume Two and Three so no description of these titles is included here.
