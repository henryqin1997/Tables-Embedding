With the exclusion of one apartment-style building that is available for juniors and seniors, all dormitories are single-sex and members of the opposite sex are only allowed to visit during a few open house hours each week. Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol are not allowed. Freshmen have a curfew of 12:30 on weeknights and 1:00am on weekends for the first semester. Dancing is technically allowed, but it is a controversial issue in the Church of the Nazarene, so we don't have organized dances. These rules are manageable for many people, but prospective students should be aware of them before deciding on ENC.}",

    "textAfterTable": "I absolutely love being at Eastern Nazarene College. I am a person who typically takes a long time to warm up to new situations, however, Eastern Nazarene is such an open, accepting environment, I felt comfortable being here within the first few days. I love attending this school and am very thankful for the opportunity to be here. Am learning a lot Since beginning at Eastern Nazarene College, I have learned a lot about myself. I was able to take classes pertaining to my major during my first semester. This helped me finalize my decision of wanting to teach preschool. With the help of a first year experience class, I learned that I would be in school, regardless of financial need to be in school. I have learned more in my first semester here at Eastern Nazarene College about myself than I learned all four years of high school.
