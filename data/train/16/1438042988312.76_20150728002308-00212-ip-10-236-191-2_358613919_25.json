    "textAfterTable": "Attention all sports fans\u2014all gay sports fans, that is... As one of the few gay sports bars in the country, Chicago's Crew Bar + Grill is the place to check out any sport whether you're gay, straight or not a sports fan at all. Don't you hate it when you're at a bar and the game you want to see isn't being shown or is playing on a TV on the other side of the bar? Well, that will never be a problem at Crew. There are more TVs then you can shake a stick at and any football, baseball, basketball, or hockey game, either college or professional, that is being played that day in the known universe will be on. You name it, Crew plays it\u2014especially Bears, Blackhawks and Texas and Ohio State football. For the unenthusiastic sports fan dragged to the bar (by crazed Bears fan friends, for example), there is a pool table and dart board in the back and plenty of food and drink to keep you fed and occupied. The bottled beer list alone has more then 40 options and the half-naked bartenders are always waiting to pour you a beer or mix up one of their specialty cocktails. Next to sports, the beer selection is the other reason why Crew is so popular. With so many choices, the game might be over by the time you figure out what you want to drink. If you're a little overwhelmed by the beer",
