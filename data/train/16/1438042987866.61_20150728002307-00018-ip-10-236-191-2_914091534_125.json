            "I felt safe. I even walked the Cow Path, a back-trail behind the main line of buildings (Teacher's College, Letterman Building, Lafollete) at night and I never once got molested or accosted... no stalkers, how boring :)",
            "no idea",
            "I'm not one to judge here, I was part of the Activities clubs... Late Nite at Ball State and the University Program Board... and yes, I did win the 'most likely to be at an event' award, so I did manage to attend most activities... (save for the Rocky Horror Show... I was currently playing a dead body in the Haunted House for that time-block)",
            "Athletes: Plenty of sports, plenty of gyms, not far from each other Greek: Plenty of Sororities and Fraternities Social: Plenty of opportunities and locations to have your parties, without getting stranded or losing focus on education",
            "Frogbaby. A curious statue of a grinning child next to a public pond... tossing money, kissing the statue, all good luck and fortune to exam time or anything. Naked Lady. Some statue in the library of a very naked dame petting dear... a common place of meeting for campus dwellers. Scramble Light. A stoplight where for a solid minute, all traffic stops and pedestrians can walk any way any direction they choose through the intersection... even if you aren't going anywhere!",
            "As pricey as BSU is, I certainly think it was worth the money. Gosh, it costs less than a moderate priced apartment for a year, I'd say.",
            "What to do... best bet, find out where Late Nite (Saturday dry parties at the Student Center, free food, free fun!) and UPB (University Program Board) have their activities, when and join in! From free movies every friday (I mean the recent ones!!!) to laser tag, to dodgeball tournaments, to petting zoos, to Carnival (Every spring), BSU has plenty to do... and that's just the mainstream fun!",
            "The food was pretty darn decent... plenty of options, plenty of dining halls, making it easy to find food fast wherever you were on campus. My favorite dining location was the Atrium, the Asian grill... nicest staff, fairly clean, and a very pretty seating area.",
            "I lucked out with having a single room... if not for medical requirements (and an alarm clock that goes off at Midnight, 4am, and 7am daily) I would have loved to have a roommate... bare walls, tile/carpet floors, bathrooms that are tidy and spacious, laundry machines that work... and I was in one of the older dorms! Overall, the dorm Life at BSU is very fun and relaxed... you can both be social or studious without disturbing other people with ease.",
            "Tough classes! If you're looking for a demanding class set, here's the place! This is not quite the school to go if you are looking for bunny classes, especially the ones in technical education! BTW, taking calculus as a freshman... bad idea unless you are a math wiz... and never do math in a lecture class of more than 30 people... mine was 300!",
            "Consider the school, sure. Meal plans are a must, as is living on-campus. Location-wise, it's fairly decent... small enough but not too small, and Muncie isn't a dead campus town either. Books, buy those elsewhere... campus bookstores are WAY too expensive to blow eight hundred dollars your first semester on (Past experience).",
            "Ball State was a brilliant college, but not quite the one for me... With a fantastic set of clubs and activities, this is an ideal institution for students looking for a social life to match their education, along with numerous networking capacities. This is one of the more expensive schools, but I'd say the price is worth the experience."

I didn't find out that I couldn't afford my first choice school until March (it was out of state, and I was waiting for the results of a scholarship contest sponsored by that school). When I found out I wasn't going there after all, I panicked because it was the only school I had visited. The first school on my what do I do now list was Ball State. I came here, and fell in love immediately!, 590771=This past summer, two of my friends, who were sophomores got a once in a lifetime opportunity to go to the 2012 London Olympics. They got to participate in the events and even meet and interview the USA Olympic basketball team. They are telecommunications majors and this opportunity was provided to them via the Telecommunications department of Ball State University., 1010887=There are tons of things the university puts on for you to have fun. Every Saturday, there is a Late Night program with different themes, and they always have free food. Each season has different events, and many associations put on different things to go to. There is also The Village right outside of Ball State. They have a coffee place and restaurant, but otherwise the street is under construction until 2015., 280283=Food was ranked among top dining halls in the country for 2010, every dorm with the exception of 2 have a place to eat within them. They have daily specials and the quality of the food is suitable to satisfy a students appetite, 1050105=I feel very safe on campus. There are little blue lights that indicate emergency buttons across campus. Still, I do not recommend walking alone at 3 o'clock in the morning.}",
