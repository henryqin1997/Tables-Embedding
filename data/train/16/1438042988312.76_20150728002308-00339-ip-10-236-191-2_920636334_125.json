            "Safety is a major concern on campus. We have safety measures for lab and even security boxes for if you feel threatened at any time on campus.",
            "Though I am not involved with Greek groups their sponsored events are always for a good cause.",
            "There is not a group on campus unrepresented. From Engineers Without Boarders to Ohio States Grilling Club. Think of it, we got.",
            "Ohio State is good for students that are able to process information at a fast pace and are willing to be competitive with fellow classmates.",
            "With any big campus there are always unusual traditions. OSU: Mirror Lake Jump. Or the slow integration of The Oval Beach. Aside from that check out the Union for great food and Knowlton Hall for the great architecture projects made by the students.",
            "Classes are not cheap but the education you receive from instructors and the free tutors that come with these classes create a balance. Aside from the education your tuition covers all things on campus so make sure to take advantage of campus resources.",
            "There is never a dull day on campus. If you are ever bored look for an event being held by one of the campus groups, take in a movie on the oval, or run and lift for a while at the RPAC.",
            "Availability for food is very easy. Aside from the dinning halls located on campus there are several cafes in the libraries and major buildings for that quick snack on campus. The campus food is also very vegetarian friendly. Aside from that High Street is not too far away and has lots of good food as well.",
            "When first moving on to campus as a freshman you don't really have the option to select roommates and some dorms are much more crowded than others. Despite this, you are exposed to a variety of people that may even be able to help you with class in the future.",
            "Some classes are more difficult than others yet for what they rank in difficulty there is unlimited help from the Teaching Assistants and tutors in the tutor rooms.",
            "Make sure to get involved with the groups and don't be afraid, commuter or resident, to get to know the great people on campus.",
            "The Ohio State University not only helps you grow to reach your dream job, it also helps you grow to be a beneficial person to your community. From the extra assistance in and outside of class to The Best Day Ever events held on campus, your time on the Buckeye Campus is one you will never forget. From freshman to junior I love my campus, I love my fellow buckeyes, and will continue to grow on this fabulous campus."

And if you can't find what you're looking for, it's pretty easy to start your own club!, 938878=Make sure you have applied for as many grants as possible because you will have over a grand in fees not including your tuition, your meal plan will cost $2200 and if your not a freshman you will need to find off campus housing, may the force be with you and good luck. Also make sure all of your tuition is paid on time, because they will want their money rain sleet hail snow, and the late fees, they really hurt the soul., 502260=We have over 1500 official clubs, so there is something for everyone! From live-action role play to leadership groups and honoraries, ballroom dancing, pistol club, improv groups, musical productions, and so many greek organizations, you name it, we have it!, 412014=Perhaps the most well-known tradition is the Mirror Lake Jump held each year in November before the Ohio State vs. Michigan game. Students will jump into Mirror Lake (located on campus) each night before the big game and it becomes a night of celebrating school spirit as well as the unification of peers. Other than that, there is the typical cheering of O-H-I-O no matter where a student may be in the world., 241143=Every Thursday in November before the OSU vs. Michigan game, all of the students jump into a ting lake on campus. There are thousands of people cheering on the team and splashing around in the little lake. The school every puts lights on for the event., 553676=Over 1000 organizations offer diversion from studies as well as a pool in the RPAC, disk golf on west campus, scavenger hunts, Zombies v. Humans, just to name the top ways to have fun. Plus, you can start your own organization if you want., 293939=Those willing to work. I mean, it is college. You can have some fun but keep in mind that you're paying a lot of money to be there so don't let your grades slip. Also if you like to get involved, there's definitely and organization for you, since there's close to 1000 on campus, 434693=we have over 1000 student organizations. can't find something for you? make a new club! i'm currently starting a car club for next year!, 425431=the library and union are great places to hang out or study. mirror lake is cool and the big jump during bea michigan week is a lot of fun. th oval is a great place to hang out. the eleventh floor of the library has an amazing view. singing carmen ohio after games is a great experience. beat michigan week is a lot of fun. light up the lake in november is a neat tradition. president gee is amazing. the long walk on the oval is a neat tradition for couples., 502734=Every year before the Ohio State-Michigan game hundreds of students jump into Mirror Lake late at night in the freezing cold of November. It's a great time, whether you are jumping in the lake or just watching and taking pictures :D, 805821=Apply before Dec. 1st to get merit scholarships., 313895=any type of student. OSU has everything. More than a 1000 clubs. It is one of the largest campuses in the nation. There will be something here, for anyone and everyone., 455773=Three words. Mirror Lake Jump. Every November before the big Michigan game all of the OSU students jump in Mirror Lake late at night. It's freezing but beyond fun. Check out youtube for more information. This is just one of the traditions you get to take part in as a Buckeye., 51107=It's college food. Some places are better than others. There are two main food plans. Traditional food plans are your scheduled, three meals a day, at certain locations, with unlimited food. There commons also accept the alternate food plan, swipes (or, now as they're called, blocks). One swipe is worth x amount of money, but one meal at traditions is one swipe. Swipes are available to use at all on campus meal locations. Most locations open at 6:30 or 7:00 in the morning and close around 8:00 pm on week days. The exceptions are Burrito's Noches, located on North campus, between North Dorms, and is open until 2:00 am. The other place open late is Sloopy's Diner, which is open until 2:30 am on weekdays and 3:30 on weekends. The food is okay, not the best, but not the worst. Also, Kennedy Commons is excellent for allergies. You tell them what you are allergic to, and they make exactly what you want, how you can have it, in front of you. Both North Commons and Kennedy Commons have gluten free and allergy sensitive food. Although you can get things cooked how you want in most food places, Kennedy Commons and North Commons take care of allergies the best., 747950=Every year there is an event where all the students come together and jump into the lake on campus, Mirror Lake. It is always in November so it is freezing, but it is so much fun!, 1078579=Classes are great because there is a wide variety of difficulties. Need a Biology credit for General Education requirements but you don't feel good at science? Take 1100, made for people just like you. Really interested in Linguistics? Take an upper-division class. Classes are generally about the same number of credit hours, but there are many options based on interest and capability that fulfill the same requirements., 470788=The Ohio State University academic rigor is slightly above average, for the most part because of the Quarter system the University follows. Although, starting the 2012-2013 academic year, the University will be following the traditional Semester system., 275923=South Campus has the nicer and subsequently more desired housing options (Smith-Steeb and Park-Stradley), however North Campus is currently adding four new dorms for the 2015-16 class, so those are options as well., 334922=If you want a high-quality education for less money from a well-respected university that even has a famous football team, you should definately apply at OSU. You get your own email account, have many opportunities outside of class like doing research with faculty members, and the campuses are clean and well-cared for. My number one tip for applying students is to make sure you apply for financial aid before March 1 of each year. This will give you a greater chance for receiving financial aid. Also, try not to take more than 15 - 20 credit hours (under the quarter system) your first term so you get an accurate feel of what a typical college course load is like. More than that will leave you exhausted and feeling like college is too difficult to be worthwhile., 118814=food is readily available all over campus. it's not the best food you'll ever have, but it's also not bad. it's pretty much what you'd expect but with a little more variety. one of the advantages of a large school is the large number of mouths to feed. a new meal plan set-up for 2012-2013 should be interesting for everyone., 435337=the thursday before the michigan game, which is in november by the way, we all go to mirror lake and jump in. it's called mirror lake jump night. it's supposed to be a good luck ritual to beat our rivals from the state up north. yes, it is freezing but there is a sense of unity in the air and it's something a lot of people can't say they've ever done. we join arms and sing our fight song and carmen ohio because for that night, no matter what race you are or where you're from, we're all buckeyes and we all hate michigan., 927129=The Mirror Lake Jump. You have to do it at least once, no matter how cold or icy the lake is. It seems crazy to jump into a lake in late November, but it helps us beat Michigan. You have to participate at least once, and after that you can watch from the sidelines. You won't regret it., 756333=Well over 1000 clubs... you can find anything you could possibly want., 45943=Ohio State traditions are closely associated with our rich football history, since we've been playing since the 1800's. In fact, game day Saturdays is a tradition in and of itself. Two hours before every home football game, the Ohio State University Marching Band performs a hybrid pep-rally/rehearsal that is free to the public in St. John's Arena across from the Horse Shoe. It's called a Skull Session. Since the band memorizes a different show every week, it's their last chance to focus on the music while envisioning the marching maneuvers before they preform pre-game in front of a crowd of 105,000. Often times, there are guest band, either from the opposing school or local high schools, and they perform a couple of songs. The marching band, itself, is an Ohio State tradition as well. Often called TBDBITL (The Best Damn Band In The Land), the OSUMB is a 225 piece all brass and percussion marching band, designed after a british brass band. It is a highly competitive band, and only 195 march per game. During pre-game, the marching band performs the Incomparable Script Ohio. It is a follow the leader drill, where, from a block O, where the band forms the word Ohio in a scripted font. While the idea is taken from the University of Michigan's rendition long ago, it is a different, more difficult and dangerous, drill. As the final O is closed up, the Drum Major leads a 4th year (as in that member has been in the band 4 years, not that they are in their 4th year at Ohio State) sousaphone major to dot the I. This is a prestigious achievement, as only a few people have ever dotted the I. As other universities, Ohio State has songs that are strongly tied to the University. The Alma Mater, Carmen Ohio, was written by a football player on the train back to Columbus after a demoralizing loss to that team up north. Now, it is sung after many sporting events, and is best known for being sung by the football team after each game, win or loss. The school's fight songs, Fight The Team and Buckeye Battle Cry are also played frequently to rally the team or celebrate a good play. Fan favorites include Hang On Sloopy and Sweet Caroline. On campus there is a lake called Mirror Lake. On the Tuesday before The Game (the annual match-up between Ohio State and the University of Michigan), students jump into the lake for good luck. Before the 2011 season, the Mirror Lake Jump used to be on Thursdays, but with the change in schedule, and The Game being played on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, it has been pushed back to the Tuesday before so students can still participate. The biggest attraction to the University is Ohio Stadium. Nicknamed The Horse Shoe, or, The Shoe for short, it houses 105,00+ fans per game day. The roar of the crowd can be heard across campus. It is definitely a tradition and experience in itself. Perhaps the most far reaching of all traditions is the O-H-I-O cheer. You hear it everywhere you go, as long as there is an OSU alum or fan, it can be heard. If there's an O-H, expect to hear an answering I-O., 340926=The amount of people that are at this university is quite possibly the biggest asset. I have met students from practically every part of Ohio, in addition to students from around the US and the rest of the world. There is an especially large Asian population on campus and I have enjoyed learning more about their culture and it's always fun to hear stories from them about how life is different in the US. In addition, there are almost 1000 clubs and organizations here as well and there is something here for everyone. One of my personal favorites is the inner tube water polo team!, 243835=I live in Smith Hall, which is an older building on south campus. There are 24 girls on my floor and 24 boys. We have bathrooms for each gender, so there are three showers for all 24 girls. It was gross to me at first, but the floor is cleaned every weekday. Also, the dorms on south campus (Smith and Steeb) are being renovated in the 2012-2013 school year. This year, Stradley and Park are in the process of being renovated., 704839=Well first off, you HAVE to go to a football game. In case you don't know, OSU is kind of big on football, and nothing beats Saturday in the shoe. Also, join a club! There's nearly 2000 student organizations here, and there's a little bit of something for everyone., 407788=There are nearly 1000 clubs and activities, so there's always something going on. The feeling unity when you scream out O-H-I-O! at the home games., 154176=Script Ohio is a huge tradition here at Ohio State. Ohio State has one of the best marching bands in all of the land. Before each football game they march onto the field and write out Ohio in script letters. This is a great site to see because looking around the stadium packed with 100,000+ Ohio State fans you feel so proud to call yourself a Buckeye., 863839=The Mirror Lake Jump happens every November on the Tuesday before the Ohio State vs Michigan football game. Students run down to the lake in the freezing cold and jump in amidst thousands of other students and sometimes snow or rain. Everyone is freezing but it is a tradition worth doing as it is a memory that will last forever., 335983=I can get more education at The Ohio State University for about 1/4 the cost compared to another college that I considered going to. In addition, that college was going to use some of OSU's resources and lab equipment! Talk about a rip-off! OSU also offers a lot of private financial aid along with funding from the government, if you apply before the first of March each year., 552046=Over 1000 available and the option to start your own.}",
