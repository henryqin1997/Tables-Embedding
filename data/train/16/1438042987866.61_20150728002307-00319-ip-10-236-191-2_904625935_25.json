            "There is a multitude of clubs on campus to choose from. There is even a Club Night where all the clubs come and set up posters and talk about their club so that if you want to join one you can decide which ones and join.",
            "Students with an environmental, sustainability, and/or wildlife interest as well as those looking for a small school with a hands-on, personal learning experience.",
            "There is always something to do. There are different sorts of music artists, movie nights, and other activities that are put on by the Student Activities Board on a constant basis and there are all sorts of trips and festive events held and put on almost every week by the college. Unity is a small town, but there are amazing pizza and home-cooking joints and the bigger cities of Maine are all about a 35-45 minute drive away if you're looking for something more big lights.",
            "It isn't the worst food around and it is good for you most of the time because they try to keep it locally or New England grown, but it does remind me of grade school cafeteria food sometimes.",
            "It depends on you, your personality, and your dorm/those in your dorm. There are quiet hours, but they tend to run late enough that the late night people can have fun, but early enough that those early-to-bed early-to-rise people aren't disturbed. It is like a small family for the most part and you're all there for each other to have fun or to comfort.",
            "This all depends on your classes, but as a general rule I feel like the academic rigor is average to relatively difficult (if I could give this three and a half stars I would). As long as you make sure that you are understanding what the teacher is trying to tell you in class or ask them about it afterwards, it isn't too bad.",
            "As parent-like as it sounds, use your time wisely. There is so much fun stuff to do and you have your own space and freedom, but there is still work that needs to be done. Don't let time get away from you, you might regret it. Time management is key.",
            "It is a great school for those who want a hands-on, personal college learning experience. At Unity College you will not be bored if you don't want to be. Events and trips are held for students almost constantly and in class hands-on and field experience makes Unity College one of a kind."

I went in March, so there was still snow on the ground and I had to wear a snow jacket, but it was worth it. Unity College really cares about you as an individual and realizes that not everyone will go home for the weekend, so there is plenty to do here. With over fifty clubs and intramural sports to choose from, there will never be an instant where you'll be bored. And with the snow, snowman contests and snowball fights are always in effect! :)}",
