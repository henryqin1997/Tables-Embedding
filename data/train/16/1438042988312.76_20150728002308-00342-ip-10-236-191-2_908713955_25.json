It's a pretty small campus, but it is a pretty beautiful one and the groundskeepers do their job well. May not have been my first choice, but I am not disappointed in the school., 171993=two classes costs $1600, 363169=The back to school bash in august on tybee is the best. You get freed food, free stuff and get to meet all the fresh meat on campus. The International Garden is the most relaxing place on campus, perfect for quiet meditation or lunch with friends. The front porch in The Student Union is really nice on a sunny day. Just sit up there and study in your rocking chair. The new Student Center is really cool and very high tech. Perfect for group study sessions. The Art Gallery is also a nice place to get away and stare at cool art done by fellow students., 23730=The academics are tad more rigorous than a normal college, but Armstrong is the best!! The teachers help in ANY way possible if you put forth enough effort to learn the material. The classes are average size with roughly 24:1 ratio, and most classes are 50 min. long!!, 291807=The food is the same so be prepared to call to the diner to put in a special request. Sometimes the rice is undone, the soup is too salty, the desserts seem like they are kept forever because they are stiff or dry, and the salad bar is the same. The best time to eat is Noon to 3 o'clock because the faculty and staff eats., 242948=The RAs are very nice and constantly keeping you informed about things on campus. Do remember to have command stips or yellow poster putty, the blue poster putty leaves stains on the walls and you can be charged for that! Make a connection with your roommate! Don't be that kid who has to go through roommate counseling because you hate your roomie. Do bring a fan if you get hot, summer months (August and September, April and May) are VERY warm. Do bring tons of hangers and have storage totes to place things you don't regularly use in. Do find an extra long shower curtain or an extra curtain rod and regular shower curtain. The rod height in winward is higher than average and if you don't have the curtain/rod combo or an XL shower curtain-your floor will get soaking wet. Do remember to bring all the comforts of home with you! Remember to take your pirate card and keys everywhere. EVERYWHERE. It's how you get back into Winward., 394978=Every year during October we have Celebrate Armstrong were EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE is out for one big festival of fun, food and games. This past year Celebrate was an weekend event that ended with the first ever firework display in Southside Savannah., 160017=Dorm life at Armstrong is very rewarding! You meet so many people and really are able to get fully immersed in campus life! My best times on campus were when I lived on campus for two years. The dorms are nice too. The new freshmen dorm was built in Fall 2010. There are many different options for on campus housing including two or four bedroom suite style apartments. Also, there are options in central campus and on the serene far ends of campus for less activity. Housing department is very considerate and takes maintenance seriously., 164450=At Armstrong we have Beach Bash every August. We go to Tybee Island grill out, and have fun, 455504=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 356209=Go to the beach! Although it isn't right around the corner, its a 25-30 minutes of a drive. Students drive out to Tybee Island to have fun with friends. Go for a walk at Forsyth Park located downtown or spend a day downtown on river street & city market with friends. On campus, participate on the many events held by different organizations. In October we celebrate Armstrong Day (celebrate) which is a lot of activities outside in the student lawn. There is free food, free prizes, free t-shirts and even a mechanical bull. Whatever the event is on school, its always guaranteed to have you meet and make new friends.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Come here! You'll love it. I moved here all alone and made friends the first week I was here. Live on campus your first year, you can meet a lot of people that way. Bang for the buck Very inexpensive for a University. Am enjoying being here Armstrong is in a great city and is conveniently located to shopping, restaurants, etc. It is very nice. The fraternities and sororities are a plus as well. Am learning a lot The Science classes are very though, even for Biology majors, but Armstrong is a great college. I love it here. Most of the teachers are available to help you during office hours and there are a ton of places to get help on campus as well.
