            "This is an example of drawing a marker line on a bar chart. The z-order is set to 1, so the line is drawn on top of the bars. This example uses the same data for both the bars and the data line.",
            "This is the same bar chart, but with an additional data series just for the line. This is an example of a compound chart. Compound charts are drawn by adding additional data series to the chd parameter, plus a value to chd telling the chart to \"ignore\" the additional data series. See Compound Charts for more information."

Each series is drawn as one complete circuit of the chart. The chart connects these points with straight or curved lines, as you specify.
