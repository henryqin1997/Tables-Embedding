Lansoprazole R isomer, magnesium carbonate, sucrose (pulverized sucrose), corn starch and low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose were thoroughly mixed to obtain a spreading mixture of principal ingredient. In addition, sucrose (pulverized sucrose), corn starch and low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose were thoroughly mixed to obtain a spreading mixture for overcoating. Spherical granules consisting of sucrose and starch were placed in a centrifugal Fluid-bed granulator (CF manufactured by Freund), and the above spreading mixture of principal ingredient was successively coated while spraying a hydroxypropylcellulose solution (2%: W/W) to obtain spherical granules. The coating operation conditions were as follows: rotor rotating speed: 300 rpm, spray rate: 1.8 g/min, spray air pressure: 0.2 kg/cm2, and slit air pressure: 0.2 kg/cm2. The resultant spherical granules were dried in a vacuum at 40\ufffd C. for 20 hours, and passed through a round sieve to obtain granules of 710 \u03bcm to 1420 \u03bcm., 42732=(14) Granules comprising a principal ingredient layer containing a PPI in an amount of about 12% by weight to about 40% by weight based on the total granules, and one or more basic inorganic salts selected from the group consisting of basic salts of a sodium salt, a potassium salt, an aluminum salt, a magnesium salt and a calcium salt in an amount of about 0.2 part by weight to about 0.6 part by weight based on 1 part by weight of the PPI; an intermediate coating layer which is formed on the principal ingredient layer; and an enteric coating layer which is formed on the intermediate coating layer, and having an average particle size of about 1000 \u03bcm to about 2000 \u03bcm;, 70063=For obtaining the granules having higher sphericity and narrower particle size distribution, in the present invention, the principal ingredient layer is formed by coating cores composed of one or more materials selected from sucrose, starch, lactose and microcrystalline cellulose with the benzimidazole compound. For example, granules having a core may be prepared by the method described in JP 63-301816 A. Such granules can be obtained by a method of coating a sugar core with a powdery spreading mixture containing the benzimidazole compound having antiulcer activity, the basic metal salt, an excipient, a disintegrating agent and the like, while spraying a binder solution of hydroxypropylcellulose on the sugar cores. Examples of the core granules include Nonpareil obtained by coating sucrose (75 parts by weight) with corn starch (25 parts by weight) by a known per se method, spherical core granules using microcrystalline cellulose, etc. Alternatively, core granules per se may be an active ingredient which becomes the above principal ingredient layer. An average particle size of the core granules is generally 14 to 80 mesh., 44282=(17) Granules comprising a principal ingredient layer containing lansoprazole or an optically active isomer (R isomer) thereof in an amount of about 14% by weight to about 20% by weight based on the total granules, and one or more basic inorganic salts selected from the group consisting of basic salts of magnesium and calcium in an amount of about 0.2 part by weight to about 0.4 part by weight based on 1 part by weight of lansoprazole or an optically active isomer (R isomer) thereof; an intermediate coating layer which is formed on the principal ingredient layer; and an enteric coating layer which is formed on the intermediate coating layer, and having an average particle size of 1000 \u03bcm to about 2000 \u03bcm;, 163648=An enteric suspension was coated on the above granules using a fluidized granulation coating machine (LAB-1 manufactured by Powlex), which was dried as such, and passed through a round sieve to obtain enteric granules of 850 to 1420 \u03bcm. The coating operation conditions were as follows: inlet air volume: 0.6 m3/min, inlet air temperature: 85\ufffd C., spray rate: 8 g/min, and spray air pressure: 1 kg/cm2., 68257=The particle size is measured by using a sieving method (Powder-Theory and Application-, p475, 1979, Maruzen), and the average particle size is calculated based on an average of meshes of corresponding sieves and weight distribution. That is, arithmetic averaging is performed based on a product of an average and each weight., 84494=A daily dosage varies depending on the degree of symptom, the age, sex and weight of subject, the administration time, interval, and the kind of principal or active ingredient, etc., and is not specifically limited. For example, when orally administered to an adult (60 kg) as an antiulcer agent, a dosage is about 0.5 to 1500 mg/day, preferably about 5 to 150 mg/day in terms of an active component. These benzimidazole compound-containing preparations may be administered once or by dividing into 2 to 3 times daily., 67119=In the present invention, the \u201cgranules containing PPI (benzimidazole compound, etc.) in an amount of about 12% by weight to about 40% by weight based on the total granules, containing the basic inorganic salt as a stabilizing agent, and having an average particle size of about 600 \u03bcm or more\u201d are preferred. When the particle size is smaller, it is difficult to increase concentration of the benzimidazole compound because a surface area becomes larger, which requires a larger amount of an enteric layer or agent. That is, in the present invention, it has been possible to decrease the amount of an enteric layer or agent by setting the particle size of at least about 600 \u03bcm or more, thereby increasing the concentration of the benzimidazole compound. The average particle size is about 600 to about 2500 \u03bcm. The more preferred average particle size is about 1000 to about 2000 \u03bcm. The granules may contain particles having a particle size of about 400 to about 3000 \u03bcm, preferably about 500 to about 2500 \u03bcm in so far as their average particle size, as a whole, is within the above range., 42142=(11) The granules according to the above (1), wherein an average particle size of the granules is about 1000 \u03bcm to about 2000 \u03bcm;, 184618=A suspension composed of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, titanium oxide and purified water shown in Table 2 was prepared. This suspension was coated on the above granules using a fluidized granulation coating machine (LAB-1 manufactured by Powlex), which was dried as such, and passed through a round sieve to obtain enteric granules of 850 to 1420 \u03bcm. The coating operation conditions were as follows: inlet air rate: 0.8 to 1 m3/min, inlet air temperature: 85\ufffd C., spray rate: 6 g/min, and spray air pressure: 0.8 to 1 kg/cm2., 162506=A composition is shown in Table 1. Lansoprazole R isomer, magnesium carbonate, sucrose (pulverized sucrose) and low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose were thoroughly mixed to obtain a spreading mixture of principal ingredient.

Spherical granules consisting of sucrose and starch were placed in a centrifugal Fluid-bed granulator (CF manufactured by Freund), the above spreading mixture of principal ingredient and the spreading mixture for intermediate layer were successively coated while spraying a hydroxypropylcellulose solution (2%: W/W) to obtain spherical granules. The coating operation conditions were as follows: rotor rotating speed: 300 rpm, spray rate: 1.8 g/min, spray air pressure: 0.2 kg/cm2, and slit air pressure: 0.2 kg/cm2. The resultant spherical granules were dried in a vacuum at 40\ufffd C. for 20 hours, and passed through a round sieve to obtain granules of 710 \u03bcm to 1420 \u03bcm., 161582=An enteric suspension was coated on the above granules using a fluidized granulation coating machine (LAB-1 manufactured by Powlex), which was dried as such, and passed through a round sieve to obtain enteric granules of 850 to 1420 \u03bcm. The coating operation conditions were as follows: inlet air volume: 0.6 m3/min, inlet air temperature: 85\ufffd C., spray rate: 8 g/min, and spray air pressure: 1 kg/cm2., 165494=An enteric suspension was coated on the above granules using a fluidized granulation coating machine (LAB-1 manufactured by Powlex), which was dried as such, and passed though a round sieve to obtain enteric granules of 850 to 1420 \u03bcm. The coating operation conditions were as follows: inlet air volume: 0.6 m3/min, inlet air temperature: 85\ufffd C., spray rate: 8 g/min, and spray air pressure: 1 kg/cm2., 78192=From a viewpoint of easy handling, etc., capsules and tablets are preferred. As capsules, gelatin capsules, HPMC capsules, pullulan capsules and the like may be used. When used as capsules, capsules of No.3 to No.5 in size are preferable for easy administration. For example, in case of a capsule containing lansoprazole-containing granules, preferably, granules having an average particle size of about 1000 \u03bcm to about 2000 \u03bcm are prepared by providing an intermediate coating layer on a principal ingredient layer, which contains lansoprazole in an amount of about 14% by weight to about 20% by weight based on the total granules and a basic salt of magnesium and/or calcium in an amount of about 0.2 part by weight to about 0.4 part by weight based on 1 part by weight of lansoprazole, and then providing an enteric coating layer thereon, and the granules are filled in a capsule. As a capsule containing 30 mg of lansoprazole per capsule, conventional products are No.1 to No.2 capsules, while No.3 to No.5 stable capsules can be produced according to the present invention. In addition, in case of a capsule containing 15 mg of lansoprazole per capsule in which the above granules are filled, it is possible to reduce the size to No.4 to No.5 capsules. Further, in case of a capsule containing 60 mg of lansoprazole R isomer, No.3 to No. 1 capsules are possible. Furthermore, in case of a capsule containing 40 mg, No.4 to No.2 capsules are possible and, in case of a capsule containing 30 mg, No.5 to No.3 capsules are possible., 63096=The compound (I) can be prepared by known per se methods, for example, the methods described in JP 61-50978 A, U.S. Pat. No. 4,628,098, JP 10-195068 A, WO 98/21201, JP 52-62275 A, JP 54-141783 A and the like, or similar methods.

Lansoprazole R isomer can also be prepared by a process described, for example, in WO 00-78745, WO 01/83473 and the like., 164572=A composition is shown in Table 1. Lansoprazole R isomer, magnesium carbonate, sucrose (pulverized sucrose), low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose and titanium oxide were thoroughly mixed to obtain a spreading mixture of principal ingredient. Spherical granules consisting of sucrose and starch were placed in a centrifugal Fluid-bed granulator (CF manufactured by Freund), and the above spreading mixture of principal ingredient was coated while spraying a hydroxypropylcellulose solution (2%: W/W) to obtain spherical granules. The coating operation conditions were as follows: rotor rotating speed: 300 rpm, spray rate: 1.8 g/min, spray air pressure: 0.2 kg/cm2, and slit air pressure: 0.2 kg/cm2.

    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes By optimizing a blending ratio of a basic inorganic salt with an acid-unstable medicament, in particular, a benzimidazole compound, and an average particle size, unexpectedly, the granules of the present invention enabled the acid-unstable medicament to be stable even at high concentration and high content. In addition, since the granules of the present invention contains an active ingredient at high concentration, the amount of a whole preparation can be reduced even at the same content and, therefore, the size of a capsule or the like can be reduced, and a preparation which can be easily administered can be obtained. As a result, the preparation can be easily administered to patients, in particular, elderly and pediatric patients who have difficulty in swallowing, and compliance can be improved. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY As a result, it was revealed that the granules of the present invention are stable from a viewpoint of the content. 99.1% Example 8 95.9% Example 7 97.1% Example 6 97.8% Example 5",
