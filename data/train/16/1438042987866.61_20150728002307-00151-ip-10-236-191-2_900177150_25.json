I have had great relationships with teachers and been able to keep a good G.P.A. I am now interested in joining the study abroad program for 2014., 397218=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 6857=I've been here since Summer 2009, and all I can say about this college is that I love it. I've taken art/dance history classes, business classes, music, oceanography classes and so much more! This college offers so many wonderful classes but most importantly I am learning so much while I have fun! The professors really care about all of their students, and because some classes are so small, you can work with them one on one. My experience has been amazing here and I am learning more at this college than in high school!, 61872=founded in 1913, fullerton college (formally known as fullerton junior college) is the oldest and largest community college in california. fullerton college has a yearly enrollment of 22,014 students. student life here is mostly clam and quite. fullerton college is known for being the highest ranked transfer institution in california to have more students transferring to universities of california and california state universities. but, i am just sayin, 95358=There's an annual Halloween costume contest in October, which brings out all the creative and brave individuals front and center! The chalk drawing contests on the sidewalks of the Quad allows you to view intricate works of art at ease for no cost!, 295416=$47 a unit as of Fall 2013, 17702=If you\u2019re taking an early morning class (7:30 or 8:00am class), don\u2019t buy the parking permit. There\u2019s always adequate parking on the streets and in the neighborhoods south of Chapman (the neighborhood to the north of Berkley and Chapman has signs posted saying you can\u2019t park there now). Walking is good exercise and can help wake you up before your class starts. Sit up front so you don\u2019t get distracted and can easily pay attention to what your professor is saying. You\u2019ll be glad you did when finals roll around. Join a study group\u2026these may be the very people to save your life on an important test, midterms, finals, or group projects. If you\u2019re petitioning a class and there\u2019s no room and a waiting list, sit in the front, talk to the teacher before and after class, stay all the way through the class (even when the professor says you can leave after signing your name on the wait list), and keep coming until a spot opens up. Students tend to drop classes like hot potatoes in the third week or so of the semester. Just bide your time and be patient. Do the homework. Don\u2019t cheat. Have fun., 285835=I am going to dorm this upcoming august, I am exited and nervous to find out who I will be rooming with, 363855=After applying and before you sign up for classes, you take assessments for math, English, and reading to see where you place. If you're in AP classes and fresh out of high school, you should do fine. But a lot of people have to start at the begining math and English before they are even eligible to take transfer classes. Try and get early classes so you don't have to worry about parking. By 10:30 am on a Monday, there are no spots left. But after 1:30 pm spots seem to clear up. Bathrooms are ok, just depending on the building you're in. Campus is clean, but people smoke a lot. Like a lot a lot, even though there are no smoking signs so that is kinda annoying. In the big parking structure, people don't park the greatest so try to actually park inside the lines. Overall a great community college.}",

Login to rate or flag the reviews Anonymous from Fullerton, CA 02/10/2011 Reviewer is A current student here. 6 out of 7 people found this review useful. 2 of 97 Categories Comments Great for these types of students I used to think that community college is for rejects and people that didn't take school seriously, but I was blown away by the vast number of motivated and diligent students that I met. And while I won't deny I have bumped into the occasional partiers, I am still surrounded by hard-working and intelligent students that work just as hard as I do, if not more and have 4.0 GPA's. If you want to get a higher education and you can't afford it, this is the school for you, and you",
