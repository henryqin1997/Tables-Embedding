            "Varies by professor, and you get what you put into it. Take Perkins for your science credit. Not many professors will take you hiking and teach class at the top of a mountain. Despite what people say, core is an awesome class. Really try to take stuff away from it, because it seems time consuming, but it is extremely valuable.",

            "It's a interesting little school, but definitely for those who are self seeking learners. There's a lot of opportunity for personal growth. The professors are absolutely fantastic."

It is much better than the food at a large university, but it can seem repetitive. The only complaint I have is that the dining room closes around 7:30 p.m. and opens around 7 a.m. I think it should have more availability and be open more and longer throughout the day.}",

The classes are small - there are no classes with more than thirty students. The teachers are skilled and knowledgeable in what they teach. Teachers and students work together and between the professors and the Learning Center for Academic Success, they are determined to help the student learn.
