They made finding what I needed and getting accurate information VERY easy. The pictures I have seen of campus are beautiful, they offer my major of choice online, and so much more that benefits me greatly. I recommend this college to everybody! I look forward to learning more about Faulkner and potentially attending it in the Fall 2015 semester!, 6385=I enjoy the teachers I have here. They take time to explain, answer your questions, and assist you. I made excellent grades this semester and look forward to the Spring 2013 semester.}",

Get to know your teachers! It really does make a difference. Like I said earlier, I loved mine and know that they are there to help me. What to do for fun From what I can see, the beach is about 20 to 30 minutes away, they have a bowling alley and skating rink and just about everything is on one street. There are bigger cities nearby like Mobile and Daphne. Food and Dining The day I went it was really good. But since I commute to school, I don't have a meal plan. The price to eat is about $7.00 but you can eat buffet style. Dorm Life I commute. But I hear the new dormitory is really nice. Academic Rigor Wonderful teachers! Make sure you ask questions if you don't understand. Write them down while the teacher is teaching so you don't interrupt them (just a polite way of making sure",
