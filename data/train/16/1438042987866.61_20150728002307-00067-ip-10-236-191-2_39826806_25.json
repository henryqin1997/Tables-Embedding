Section 3 of the Canadian Aviation Security Regulations, 2012 (see footnote 1) is amended by adding the following in alphabetical order:, 59901=His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, pursuant to sections 4.71 (see footnote a) and 4.9 (see footnote b) and paragraphs\u00a07.6(1)(a) (see footnote c) and (b) (see footnote d) of the Aeronautics Act (see footnote e), hereby makes the annexed Regulations Amending the Canadian Aviation Security Regulations, 2012 (Identity Screening and Aerodrome Security)., 59969=P.C. 2012-326\u00a0March 15, 2012}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{54920=Transport Canada consulted with stakeholders about the passenger identification concept and operation design principles at the Advisory Group on Aviation Security (AGAS) on November 25, 2009. AGAS members include representatives from airlines, airports, unions, associations, other government departments and CATSA. There were no comments made on the proposed concept., 43731=The passenger behaviour observation portion of the interim order expired on November 14, 2011. The aim of the pilot was to provide Transport Canada and CATSA with sufficient data to judge the general effectiveness of the program design, identify lessons learned, and confirm that the program operations respect travellers\u2019 privacy. The effectiveness of the program will be carefully assessed by Transport Canada to guide longer-term strategies., 55325=On June 3, 2010, a teleconference with stakeholders was held to further discuss the concept and obtain feedback on identity verification. Stakeholders included representatives from Air Canada, WestJet, United Airlines and US Airways, who had no objections, although stakeholders did indicate that this form of screening should only be carried out using a risk-based approach to avoid unnecessarily impacting screening throughout., 59993=Footnote b S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 7, 52758=All of the disclosed security measures establish requirements for aerodromes to safeguard civil aviation operations against acts of unlawful interference. These requirements have been implemented by aerodromes and monitored by Transport Canada for several years. While the substance of these disclosed security measures can be made public, the security need for the requirements remains in order to continually safeguard civil aviation operations against acts of unlawful interference, and to enable Canada to continue meeting its international aviation security obligations. The amendments integrate all of the disclosed security measures into the CASR, 2012., 46583=The disclosure of these security measures and their integration into the CASR, 2012 is part of Transport Canada\u2019s comprehensive review of its aviation security legislative framework. The exercise of reviewing, disclosing and integrating security measures into regulation complies with subsection 4.72(3) of the Act and is consistent with the Cabinet Directive on Streamlining Regulation, which includes the goals of creating accessible, understandable, and responsive regulation through inclusiveness, transparency, accountability, and public scrutiny., 41568=The amendments to the Canadian Aviation Security Regulations, 2012 (CASR, 2012) deal with integrating into regulation certain requirements from the following two instruments:, 45708=On December 10, 2011, the Minister disclosed certain security measures regarding aerodromes through a notice in the Canada Gazette, Part \u2160. The Minister determined that the disclosure of these security measures would no longer compromise aviation security. As required under the Act, the Minister has one year to repeal the disclosed security measures or replace them with regulations., 44211=The identity screening portion of the Order remains in force for one year or until regulations having the same effect are made. This form of screening is identical to what airlines are required to perform under the Identity Screening Regulations when passengers are boarding an aircraft. CATSA\u2019s authority to perform identity screening will expire on March 14, 2012, unless the requirements are codified in regulations., 60396=Footnote 1 SOR/2011-318, 60199=Footnote d S.C. 2004, c. 15, s. 18, 42420=An Interim Order Respecting Passenger Identification and Behaviour Observation (the Order) was made by the Minister of Transport on January 26, 2011. The passenger behaviour observation portion of the interim order authorized the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) to test a pilot program at the Vancouver International Airport. The identity screening portion of this Order authorized CATSA to screen persons by comparing the person, and in particular their entire face, against the required identification, and by comparing the name on the person\u2019s boarding pass with the required identification, provided that the action is necessary to mitigate a heightened risk condition. In order to accommodate the special needs of travellers, the Order provides CATSA with flexibility when performing this type of screening. Interim orders are made pursuant to subsection 6.41(1) of the Act and are valid for 14 days., 47355=The amendments to the CASR, 2012 allow CATSA to screen persons who appear to be 18 years of age or older by comparing the person, in particular their entire face, against the required identification and by comparing the name on the person\u2019s document of entitlement with the required identification if identity screening is necessary to mitigate a heightened risk condition., 60095=Footnote c S.C. 2004, c. 15, s. 18, 55791=On June 1, 2011, during the Security Screening Technical Committee meeting, stakeholders were notified of the Department\u2019s intent to codify the identity screening portion of the Interim Order into permanent regulations by the spring of 2012, at which time no comments were received., 59890=Footnote a S.C. 2004, c. 15, s. 5, 43389=The Minister signed subsequent interim orders on February 9, February 23, March 2 and March 14, 2011. On March 25, 2011, the Interim Order No. 5 Respecting Passenger Identification and Behaviour Observation was approved by the Governor in Council in accordance with subsection 6.41(3) of the Act., 51998=Therefore, on December 10, 2011, the Minister of Transport published in the Canada Gazette, Part \u2160 (www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/ p1/2011/2011-12-10/pdf/g1-14550.pdf), the substance of certain security measures that, in the opinion of the Minister, did not compromise aviation security once made public. This publication was specifically intended to provide the required notice under the Act that the Minister had formed his opinion that these security measures could be disclosed. Following the notice of disclosure, the Act requires that security measures be repealed the earlier of one year after the notice of disclosure is published or the subject matter of the security measures is dealt with in public regulation., 46138=While the substance of these disclosed security measures can be made public, the security need for the requirements remains in order to safeguard civil aviation operations against acts of unlawful interference, and enable Canada to continue meeting its international civil aviation security obligations. Transport Canada is therefore seeking to integrate these disclosed security measures into the CASR, 2012., 58254=It is worthwhile to note that administrative monetary penalty schemes established under the Act for aviation security are similar to those under this Act for aviation safety as well as those contained in the Marine Transportation Security Act and the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, all of which are administered by Transport Canada. Other federal departments and agencies, including Health Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, also rely on administrative monetary penalty schemes as an alternative to enforcing regulatory offences in the criminal courts.}",
