In this example, the software will always accept and send willow as a valid key. The key chestnut will be accepted from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and be sent from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The overlap allows for migration of keys or discrepancy in the set time of the router. Likewise, the key birch immediately follows chestnut, and there is a 30-minute leeway on each side to handle time-of-day differences., 232059=The following example illustrates the assignment of four area IDs to four IP address ranges. In the example, OSPF routing process 1 is initialized, and four OSPF areas are defined: 10.9.50.0, 2, 3, and 0.

    "textAfterTable": "Managing Authentication Keys To manage authentication keys, define a key chain, identify the keys that belong to the key chain, and specify how long each key is valid. Each key has its own key identifier (specified with the keykey-chain configuration command), which is stored locally. The combination of the key identifier and the interface associated with the message uniquely identifies the authentication algorithm and Message Digest 5 (MD5) authentication key in use. You can configure multiple keys with lifetimes. Only one authentication packet is sent, regardless of how many valid keys exist. The software examines the key numbers in order from lowest to highest and uses the first valid key that it encounters. The lifetimes allow for overlap during key changes. Note that the router must know the time. Refer to the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and calendar commands in the \"Performing Basic System Management\" chapter of the Network Management Configuration Guide. To manage authentication keys, perform the following task.
