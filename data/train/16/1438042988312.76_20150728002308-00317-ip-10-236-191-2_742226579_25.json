Losses in Horry and Georgetown counties were large enough for them to be declared in outbreak status. 100% surveys were performed in these counties and in Williamsburg County and affected landowners were notified of their problem. Surveys during the period detected 1478 beetle spots containing 309,293 dead pines. This represented a volume loss of 17,584 cords and 12,371,714 board feet of pine with a value of $4,205.715. Beetle activity in other areas of the state decreased dramatically and other counties which were previously in outbreak status were returned to endemic status., 113506=1947-48, 28574=July 1, 1997 to June 30, 1998, natural resource professionals completed 81 plans on 19,201 acres., 121775=1994-95, 670628=Harbison continues to offer support to the Scouting community. Sixteen Cub Scout programs were held at Harbison, two Girl Scout programs, and one Boy Scout forestry merit badge program conducted by the staff.

They also give back to the Forest - 8 Eagle Scout projects were conducted on Harbison State Forest during the 1997-98 fiscal year. Scouts built 4 trail bridges, widened 1500 feet of existing trails, installed 22 water bars, installed 4 benches, planted 2,000 seedlings, and constructed a 1600-foot handicapped-accessible trail to fulfill their Eagle Scout requirements. In addition, Cub Scouts performed maintenance on 10 waterbars and installed 7 new waterbars along the trails., 242049=1996-97, 109911=1942-43, 463003=April, 612236=During the Spring of 1998, 31 counties were trapped for southern pine beetles using pheromone techniques.

The Alert was still in effect at the end of the fiscal year., 630425=The development of written specifications and performance requirements for the specialized forestry equipment and services (uniform program, aerial fire detection patrol and the various nursery contracts) is coordinated and reviewed prior to beginning the actual procurement process. A procurement policy and procedures manual is maintained and distributed to personnel to inform them of the procurement procedures required by the S.C. Consolidated Procurement Code. In March 1997, the Commission received authorization from the Budget and Control Board to increase their certification to $25,000 per procurement. This approval was a result of audit performance reviews, procurement training received and given by this section, and procurement certification levels of the section personnel. In addition to State Contract purchases and purchases through the Materials Management Office, the section handled solicitations and awards for 65+ procurements totaling in excess of $465,000.00., 619422=The S.C. Forestry Commission\ufffds BMP Foresters, located in each of the three operating regions of South Carolina, offer courtesy BMP exams to landowners, foresters, and timber buyers. The BMP Forester makes site-specific BMP recommendations to follow while conducting forestry activities. During the 1997-98 fiscal year, the BMP Foresters completed 246 courtesy exams. Of the 246 sites, 237 (96%) were completed in compliance with our recommended guidelines., 115296=1985-86, 120335=1992-93, 110979=1979-80, 461901=September, 45463=Four artificial recruitment sites were constructed this summer containing two drilled cavities, one advanced start, and seven artificial cavity boxes. Translocation of juvenile birds to these sites is planned for September of this year (1998). In addition, 19 artificial cavity boxes were installed at existing clusters to augment the number of cavities available. All artificial cavity trees, as well as new natural cavity and start trees located during the winter survey were painted, tagged and GPS\ufffdd. Fifty restrictor plates were installed on enlarged cavities.

These areas were in slash pine that had stagnated. One hundred twelve acres were site prepared using Arsenal to eliminate the scrub hardwood competition. Bareroot longleaf seedlings were planted on 1,011 acres on the Forest and containerized Longleaf seedlings were planted on 145 acres on Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge. One hundred acres of longleaf plantations were treated with Class A bio-solids from the town of Cheraw. Because of the wet winter, no prescribed burning was accomplished. The following species and number of seedlings were planted: Bareroot Longleaf Pine 550,000 Containerized Longleaf Pine 80,000 Total Trees Planted 630,000 Forest Protection No wildfires occurred on Sand Hills this year. The Forest boundary lines and the road system are maintained as firebreaks and as access in case of wildfire. Recreation/Education Recreational use of the Forest continues to increase. Hunting, fishing, horseback riding, motorcycle/ATV riding, mountain biking, hiking, and camping continue to be favorite activities. A horse-riding trail from Sugarloaf Mountain to Cheraw State Park (26 miles) named the Pine Barrens Horse Trail is near completion.
