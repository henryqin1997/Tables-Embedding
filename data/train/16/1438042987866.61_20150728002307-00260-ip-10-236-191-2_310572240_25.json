            "Ryan (Denver): Yorvit Torrealba may be a poor baseball player, but he's on a one-man crusade to make me believe in clutch. And Pat Borders was a World Series MVP. This stuff happens. ...And a couple of the Joe Cocker covers, \"With a Little Help From My Friends,\" and \"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window\" are pretty good interpretations. I'm also partial to Elvis Costello's take on \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away.\" (Steven Goldman)"

(Christina Kahrl) Is it too early to start chanting for my freedom? (Chris Ianetta from Colorado) 2008-02-28 14:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) If they don't make Iannetta their first-string catcher, then they're idiots. I can think of at least 25 teams who should trade for him if that's the case. (Jay Jaffe) With Yorvit Torrealba now a free agent, will the Rockies finally hand the full-time starting duties to Chris Iannetta? Or are they going to sign some lesser veteran catcher (such as Torrealba) to eat away half of Iannetta's potential playing time again? (Frenk from Brooklyn) 2009-10-28 14:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) You would think he had after killing the ball in '08, but he was back on the bench in '09.
