            "Description",
            "Methods for Monitoring Allograft Rejection - Methods are provided for monitoring an allograft recipient for a rejection response, e.g., to predict, to diagnose, and/or to characterize a rejection response. In practicing the subject methods, the level of at least one protein in a sample from the allograft recipient, e.g., serum, urine, blood, CSF, tears or saliva, is evaluated, to monitor the subject. Also provided are compositions, systems, and kits that find use in practicing the subject methods.",
            "Biomarkers for the Diagnosis of Kidney Graft Rejection - Methods are provided for determining a transplant category of a subject having a kidney graft. In practicing one aspect of the subject methods, the peptide signature of a non-invasive sample derived from the transplant subject (e.g., a urine sample) is used to determine the subject's transplant category (e.g., acute allograft rejection (AR), stable allograft (STA), BK virus nephropathy (BK), and the like). In other embodiments, a gene expression signature from a biopsy sample from the subject (e.g., mRNA level) is used to determine the subject's transplant category. In certain embodiments both a peptide signature and a gene expression signature are used. Also provided are compositions, systems, kits and computer program products that find use in practicing the subject methods.",
            "Protein and Gene Biomarkers for Rejection of Organ Transplants - Aspects of the present invention include methods for determining a transplant category of a subject having a transplant. Common mechanisms of rejection injury are uncovered across different tissue transplants, and provide a means to understand rational drug design. Various sources of tissues are examined form the patient for understanding AR mechanism (graft biopsy), as well as monitoring by minimal invasive means (blood) or non-invasive means (urine for the kidney allograft). For biomarker discovery different categories of markers are examined such as genes, proteins, peptides and antibodies. These biomarkers can help determine the subject's transplant category (e.g., acute allograft rejection (AR), stable allograft (STA), BK viremia, BK nephritis, drug toxicity or chronic allograft injury (CAI), and the like). Also provided are compositions, systems, kits and computer program products that find use in practicing the subject methods. The methods and compositions find use in a variety of applications.",
            "Antibody Biomarkers for Diabetes - Methods are provided for determining whether a subject has a diabetes phenotype. In practicing the subject methods, a sample, e.g., a blood sample, from a subject is analyzed for the presence of one or more autoantibodies to obtain an antibody signature. The obtained antibody signature is then employed to determine whether the subject has a diabetes phenotype. The subject methods may be used in diagnostic or prognostic applications, e.g., determining whether the subject has diabetes (e.g., T1D or T2D), or monitoring a subject with diabetes to determine whether the subject has or will develop ESRD. Also provided are compositions, systems and kits that find use in practicing the subject methods. The subject methods and compositions find use in a variety of applications, including the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes in a subject.",
            "Autoantibody Biomarkers for IGA Nephropathy - Aspects of the present invention include methods for diagnosing and monitoring IgAN in a subject. In practicing one aspect of the subject methods, a sample from a subject is analyzed for the presence of one or more specific autoantibodies to determine the IgAN phenotype of the subject. Also provided are compositions, systems, kits and computer program products that find use in practicing the subject methods. The methods and compositions find use in a variety of applications."

The notes may be taken on a portable computing device that contains metadata from the computer based content. The metadata and input are stored and once the portable computing device is in communication with the second computing device displaying the computer based content, the input is displayed near the computer based content that was displayed at the time the input was created. 20090282341 11-12-2009 INPUTTING DATA ON A PORTABLE COMPUTING DEVICE - A method for displaying input from a portable computing device on a second computing device is described. Later inputs on the portable computing device are displayed in a scrolling fashion on the second computing device with later input being displayed below previous input without regard to the location of the input on the portable computing device. 20090282330 11-12-2009 LEARNING ASSESSMENT AND PROGRAMMATIC REMEDIATION - Learning content may be provided to a user where the learning content may contain learning objectives. A response to the learning content may be received. The response may be analyzed by determining whether the response was the proper response to the learning objectives. If the response was a proper response, less questions on the learning objective may be presented in the future and the if response was an improper response, additional questions on the learning objective may be",
