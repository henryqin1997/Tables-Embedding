It is easy to navigate and get into, if you have basic online proficiency. I am in the Business Administration DCP, and find that it is well-designed for the working adult. The courses are given one at a time for focused study, while maintaining full-time enrollment status. This is the best feature, and makes other drawbacks worth it. The admissions staff is exceptional. Financial aid is lukewarm, especially for online students; it is best to have a backup plan for financing graduation. However, they say that online students enjoy a lower tuition cost then the traditional student does. Pell and FSEOG, yes--early FAFSA on Jan.1 gets the rewards--Perkins, no., 24775=The online forums are mandatory; the quality of discussion with fellow students is very low. Many do not have critical thinking skills and have poor spelling and grammar. The online teacher tolerated multiple incidents of a student plagerizing another students work in the forum posting. This led me to conclude that the instructor is not really reading the posts. If this kind of thing does not bother you, the online program certainly gets the job done, but it is more suitable for the independent-minded person., 147182=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Also, ask your professors for help... that is what they are there for! Bang for the buck I have learned so much from my professors. Again, it is the effort you put into it though. Many professors will give you their home phone number and help you outside classroom hours, which is extremely useful if you are uncertain about an assignment.
