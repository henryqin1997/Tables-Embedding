The Red Cross Blood Mobile is on campus at least once a month. Most clubs and organizations give back to charities., 4995=15 Units? Less than $1000 dollars. Yes. Bang for the buck, indeed., 229880=It is a pretty decent community college. The teachers are pretty good, and they have lots of great sports areas like a nice track, tennis courts, baseball fields, field hockey, golf, etc. The only real negatives so far have been no swimming pool, and the parking is a mess unless you get there by 8:00 am.}",

Tips for prospective students If you want to save money, GO TO MOORPARK. However, if you plan on transferring to a private school, check their transfer agreements before signing up for classes. Also, know the CRN numbers before the sign-up dats. Do choir; Vail Keck is a wonderful professor. Take a philosophy class with Janic Daurio; brilliant woman. Bang for the buck 15 Units? Less than $1000 dollars. Yes. Bang for the buck, indeed. Am enjoying being here It's in a beautiful area, but I personally don't like the feel of it. It's just a personal things. Nice professors though. Am learning a lot Most of the teachers are quiet knowledgeable and have a good grasp of their subject matter.
