Verses 3 and 6 are the key to this opening paragraph. It signified a turning from idols and returning to YHWH (cf. Isa. 31:6-7). It is used extensively by Jeremiah for spiritual conversion (e.g. 15:19; 18:8,11). God always takes the initiative in human repentance (cf. Jer. 31:18; Lam. 5:21; Prov. 8:3,7,19; John 6:44,65; Acts 5:31; 8:22; II Tim. 2:25). However, God has structured His Covenant in such a way that humans must respond in repentance and faith to Him (cf. Mark 1:15; Acts 2:38,41; 3:16,19; 20:21). Because these were already covenant people it is uncertain whether this text is referring to initial personal salvation (cf. Isa. 55:6-7) or what we would call today a rededication experience (cf. vv. 4,6; Rev. 2:5,16,21,22; 3:3,19,20). In the OT descendants of Abraham were part of the people of God, but it is obvious from the OT itself that all of them did not have a personal faith relationship with God that impacted their daily lives. Religion, ritual, and self-righteous legalism are always barriers and blinders., 989097=\u25a3 \"the sling stones\" These were stones used in sling weapons (BDB 887 I), which were used to defend cities and forts (cf. Jdgs. 20:16; I Sam. 17:40,50; II Chr. 26:14; Job 41:28). This is a metaphor for the complete destruction of a military foe., 422841=\u25a3 \"Son of man\" Here \"man\" simply refers to Daniel as a human being (Adam, cf. v. 16), as in Ezek. 2:1; 3:1; 4:1; 5:1; 6:2; 7:2; 12:2,8; and Ps. 8:4. The angel Gabriel is addressing Daniel., 992510=2.\u00a0Lexicon, William Holladay, \"rally around the banner\" (p. 240). This comes from Ps. 60:4, which may refer to Exod. 17:15 or possibly Isa. 62:10., 713566=5.\u00a0\"I lifted up my eyes and looked,\" 2:1, 662862=\u25a3 \"a time, times, and half a time\" There has been much discussion over this phrase. This exact phrase is used in Dan. 7:25 (and Rev. 12:14). It seems to be an apocalyptic idiom for a time of persecution (half of seven, cf. Milton S. Terry, Biblical Hermeneutics, p. 445). There are several other phrases in Daniel and the Book of the Revelation that use this basic time frame: (1) Dan. 8:14,26 \u2014 2300 evenings and mornings. This has been interpreted as either (a) 1150 days or (b) 6 years, 110 days; (2) Dan. 9:27 \u2014 reference to half of seven; (3) Dan. 12:11 \u2014 1290 days; (4) Dan. 12:12 \u2014 1335 days; (5) Rev. 11:2-13:5 42 months or 1260 days (Rev. 11:3; 12:6). This seems to refer to about three and one-half years in the lunar calendar. These numbers are more symbolic than literal because of their similarity, yet their difference., 91293=1:18 \"at the end of the days\" This refers to v. 5., 625471=1.\u00a0mysterious, wonderful, Deut. 17:8; Prov. 30:18, 405215=8:8 \"the male goat magnified himself greatly\" See note at vv. 4,5., 138703=2:33 \"clay\" This refers to baked clay (\"potter's clay\" or terra cotta), as do verses 34,35, first use in 41, 42, but verses 41 and 43 seem to mean wet clay (\"miry clay\")., 1006589=10:2 \"teraphim\" This refers to household idols, apparently in humanoid form, used to discern the will of the departed family spirits or the family gods (cf. Gen. 31:19,34; Jdgs. 17:5; 18:14-20; I Sam. 15:23; 19:13; II Kgs. 23:24; Hos. 3:4). The exact etymology of this term (BDB 1076) is uncertain., 902972=Often in the OT the Spirit is a way of referring to God (e.g. Ps. 139:7-8; Isa. 40:13; 60:10-11) or God's creative activity (e.g. Gen. 1:2). God energizes humans to perform tasks with His strength and wisdom (e.g. Exod. 28:3; 31:3; 35:31,34; Jdgs. 3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 13:54; 14:6,19; 15:14)., 918713=8:6 \"If it is too difficult\" The Jewish people had become accustomed to captivity and judgment so these promises overwhelmed them! The term \"difficult\" (BDB 810, Niphal IMPERFECT) also means \"wonderful.\" See note at Dan. 8:24., 338073=b.\u00a0Daniel's fears in 4:2 and the people's fear in 5:19, 548336=1.\u00a0Gen. 49:1 - Israel's possession of Canaan, 561333=1.\u00a0Why is there a problem between Daniel 1:21 and 10:1?, 648491=\u25a3 \"written in the book\" This same metaphorical book of 1ife is referred to in Dan. 7:10. There are two books mentioned in the Bible (cf. Rev. 10:12-15), one is the \"Book of Remembrances\" where the deeds of both the godly and ungodly are recorded, Ps. 56:8; 139:16; Isa. 65:6; Mal. 3:16. The other is the \"Book of Life\" where only the names of the redeemed are mentioned, Exod. 32:32; Ps. 69:28; Isa. 4:3; Dan. 12:1; Luke 10:20; Phil. 4:3; Heb. 12:23: Rev. 3:5: 13:8: 17:8: 20:15: 21:27., 392269=1.\u00a0Neo-Babylonian, 2:38, 409559=The term \"host\" often applies to YHWH\"s angelic army (TEV, cf. Josh. 5:14,15; I Sam. 1:3; Neh. 9:6), but in this context (cf. 8:12) it refers to (1) the people of God (\"saints,\" cf. 7:18,22,27) or (2) a metaphor for the little horn's ambition to rival God (e.g. Isa. 14:13, the kings of Babylon), in which case the stars would refer to angels or heaven., 4355=The whole issue of resurrection is caught up in this discussion. What are believers to expect? Even Daniel 7:18,22 may imply an earthly setting, but 12:2 implies something beyond the physical. Two NT texts seem relevant at this point: (1) Jesus' words to Pilate in John 18:33-38a (esp. v. 36) and (2) Paul's discussion of the resurrection in I Cor. 15 (esp. vv. 35-53). Both of these texts open the door to a spiritual understanding of the future. It is hard for us as humans to comprehend (a) personality without a physical body and (b) a kingdom without a physical planet!, 1098985=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:13:1 \u00a01\"In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity., 93247=The Hebrew term (BDB 355) is chartummim, which is from charath, an engraving tool from an Egyptian loan word (cf. Gen. 41:8,24; Exod. 7:11,22; 8:7,18-19; 9:11). This probably refers to the magical texts and charms found in cuneiform tablets., 1014180=10:4 \"From them\" The Masoretic Text has \"from him\" (cf. NKJV and NAB, also note \"He\" of v. 11). There have been several possibilities as to the object of this verse: (1) it refers to future events, either Maccabean or eschatological; (2) it is a direct reference, which means out of Judah leaders will come (NIV, cf. vv. 3-6; Gen. 49:10; II Sam. 7); or (3) the Targums, which are Aramaic translations and interpretations of the Hebrew text, assert that this refers to King Messiah., 295276=The prophets also combined Media and Persia as one entity as the parallelism of Isa. 21:2 (Elam and Media) clearly shows. Some scholars refer to Isa. 13:17 and Jer. 51:11,28 as an attempt to show that the prophets falsely saw Media as a separate empire (cf. NAB p. 1096), an error which they assert that Daniel followed., 143009=2:38 This description of Nebuchadnezzar's reign seems to mimic Gen. 1:28 (cf. Jer. 27:6; 28:14)., 396431=8:1 \"in the third year of the reign of Belshazzar\" This shows that the vision of chapter 8 came after a time span of two years from the vision of chapter 7. We do not know when or how long Belshazzar served as co-regent under his father, Nabonidus, before the fall of the Neo-Babylon Empire by the army of Cyrus II, Cyrus the Great (cf. Dan. 5). Chapter 8 restarts the Hebrew section of the Book of Daniel (i.e. 1:1-2:3; 8:1-12:13)., 933725=8:19 This literary unit which begins in 7:1 with a question about the need to continue certain fast days related to the Babylonian exile. After discussing the reason for the exile and the hope of restoration, Zechariah returns to the question about specific fast days., 403059=8:5 \"a male goat was coming from the west over the whole surface of the earth without touching the ground\" This refers to Greece (cf. 8:21; 11:3). Notice the speed of the victory (334-331 b.c.) and direction from which Alexander II, known as Alexander the Great, came. This parallels the leopard with four wings of 7:6., 617648=\u25a3 \"the abomination of desolation\" In this context it seems to refer to Antiochus IV Epiphanes' orders to offer a pig on the altar in the Temple in Jerusalem and set up a shrine to Zeus Olympus in the Holy Place (Dec. 168 b.c., cf. I Macc. 1:54, 59). This started the Maccabean revolution. Jesus uses this same phrase to describe the coming of the Roman armies against Jerusalem in Matt. 24:15, Mark 13:14 and Luke 21:20. Obviously this phrase is used in several ways to describe the horrors that the people of God would face throughout history. There is an obvious allusion to end-time events, but as to specific details, they will remain ambiguous until that day comes., 205831=4:7 For the meaning of these terms see 1:20 or 2:2., 732262=1:17 \"Again, proclaim\" This parallels v. 14 (both Qal IMPERATIVES). The interpreting angel gives YHWH's words (cf. v. 13) in two parts: (1) restoration and (2) prosperity., 176075=3:15 \"what god is there who can deliver you out of my hands\" This is theologically similar to II Kgs. 18:33 and 19:12. YHWH is openly challenged to demonstrate His existence, power, and compassion to those who trust Him (cf. v. 28). YHWH reveals Himself to the nations by showing His sovereignty and love for His covenant people., 367236=7:19, 162599=3:1 \"an image of gold\" The image (BDB 1109 - statue, form) may have been similar to the vision of a human person made of four metals from chapter 2. It is either (1) an elongated human form or (2) a tall obelisk of uncertain shape. The Aramaic term can mean \"obelisk.\" The normal physical proportions of the human body is five to one, but the image's height and width would be ten to one. A large platform has been found six miles from the ruins of the ancient city of Babylon, which measures forty-five feet by forty-five feet by eighteen feet. This could have been the base of this image., 1040739=11:2 \"Wail\" There are two Hiphil IMPERATIVES (v. 2a,c). This term (BDB 410, KB 413) is used for God's judgment on God's people (cf. Hos. 7:14; Micah 1:8; Zeph. 1:11) and for God's judgment on the surrounding nations (cf. Isa. 13:6; 16:7; 23:1,6,14; 52:5; Jer. 48:39; 49:3)., 323361=7:1 \"in the first year of Belshazzar\" This shows that the book is not written in chronological order (cf. chapter 5, which is the fall of the city of Babylon in Oct. of 539 b.c.). The date mentioned in the text would be about 552-551 b.c., which is fourteen years after chapter 5. The Aramaic section of Daniel goes from 2:4 through 7:28, which marks it as a literary unit. Therefore, we must relate chapter 7 with what goes before, as well as with what follows., 363451=a.\u00a0the Hebrew counterpart phrase almost always refers to angels (cf. 4:13,17,23; 8:13; Job 5:1; Ps. 89:5,7), 301245=6:17 \"the stone was brought and laid over the mouth of the den\" Lions were kept for the hunting pleasure of near Eastern royalty. Death by being thrown to wild animals was a common method of execution by the royal courts of the Ancient Near East and East. Apparently the den was an underground pit with two entrances, one from the top (cf. v. 23) and one from the bottom. Again, the fall should have killed him (cf. 3:20), much less the hungry lions., 810492=\u25a3 \"lampstand\" This is the Hebrew word menorah (BDB 633), which is literally \"lamp.\" There are two temple precedents: (1) Exod. 25:31-40; Num. 8:1-4, a lampstand in the Tabernacle which had seven branches and (2) I Kgs. 7:49, a lampstand in Solomon's temple which had ten branches. However, this vision may be a different kind of lampstand. The description does not fit the menorah of the temple., 665304=12:8 \"But as for me, I heard but could not understand\" Daniel had been given special gifts of wisdom and dream (vision) interpretation (cf. 1:17). In 8:16 the powerful angel orders Gabriel to give Daniel understanding (cf. 9:22; 10:21). However, this does not mean to imply that Daniel understood everything about these visions. His understanding was still limited by his sixth century b.c. context. Some of these visions were not for OT people of God. The New Covenant and the two comings of Christ alter Daniel's Mosaic orientation., 860359=\u25a3 \"standing before\" This is a Hebrew idiom (BDB 426, KB 427, Hithpael INFINITIVE), which denotes service. Here it speaks of angelic beings presenting themselves before YHWH as in Job 1:6; 2:1., 294681=6:8 \"the law of the Medes and Persians\" This same binding legal status of the decrees of the Medo-Persian kings as being unchangeable is found in vv. 12,15,17; Esther 1:19; 8:8; and Diodorus Siculus 17:30., 693399=D.\u00a0Much modern scholarship is recognizing a particular type of two-way stair step parallelism called chiasmus in both 1:7-6:15 and 9-14 (cf. Joyce Baldwin, Tyndale OT Commentary, pp. 74-81). If this is true, then the fourth and fifth visions take an emphasized structural position., 747699=2.\u00a0the interpreting angel (e.g. 1:14,19,21; 2:3,4,12-15), 845607=5:11 \"to build a temple for her\" This may be sarcasm or typology. The faithful, obedient Jews will have a rebuilt temple to worship YHWH, so will the idolatrous, unfaithful Jews have an apostate place of worship., 182640=3:25 \"I see four men loosed and walking about in the midst of the fire\" There has been much discussion about how Nebuchadnezzar could see. It seems that the brick kiln was a domed structure with a place at the bottom for the removal of ashes. Apparently, he looked through the hole in the bottom and saw the young men walking about., 726964=1:13 \"The Lord answered the angel who was speaking with me\" Notice YHWH does not answer the angel of the Lord among the myrtle trees who asked the question in v.12, but He addresses the interpreting angel (cf. v. 9). The content of YHWH's gracious and comforting words is found in vv. 14-17., 724506=1:12 \"how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah\" The angel (cf. vv. 10,11) is addressing a question to YHWH about the extent of the exile. The angel is concerned about the lack of progress., 122396=2:14, 108978=\u25a3 \"magicians\" This is from the Hebrew word \"engraving tool.\" See note at 1:20. A good discussion of these different kinds of wise men is found in Robert B. Girdlestone's Synonyms of the Old Testament, pp. 296-302., 730334=1:16, 433403=The VERB means \"corrupt\" (BDB 1007, KB 1469, Hiphil PERFECT, cf. Gen. 6:12; Deut. 4:16; 31:29; Ezek. 16:47), \"ruin\" (cf. Mal. 3:11), or \"destroy\" (cf. v. 25; Isa. 36:10; Jer. 51:20)., 1057540=11:13 \"the Lord said to me, \u2018Throw it to the potter'\" The VERB \"throw\" (BDB 1020, KB 1527) is a Hiphil IMPERATIVE. There have been several textual emendations to explain \"potter\" (BDB 428): (1) the Septuagint has the term \"furnace smelter\" (cf. II Kgs. 12:10; 22:9); (2) the Peshitta has the term \"treasury\"; (3) the Vulgate has the term \"sculptor\"; and (4) the Masoretic text has the term \"potter\" (i.e. shaper). Some believe that it refers to Levites who made the vessels used by the priests, and therefore, a potter's shop was located in the temple. Others say that it is a Hebrew idiom for \"that which is worthless and needs to be remade.\", 328212=7:3 \"and four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another\" This seems to imply simultaneous kingdoms (cf. v. 12 and 2:44), but the extended contexts of chapters 2 and 8 demand sequential kingdoms., 543928=This seems to refer to the national angel of Persia (cf. Deut. 29:26; 32:8 in the Septuagint and Isa. 24:21)., 1134336=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:14:8 \u00a08And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter., 654538=The verse is quoted by Jesus in Matt. 13:43, which is in the context of eschatological judgment., 966163=9:6 \"a mongrel race\" This seems to refer to the Assyrian exile of the Jewish people from Israel (722 b.c.) and the import of pagan people from Media; therefore, this area was populated by people of mixed national origins. The rabbis later use this term (BDB 561, an Aramaic word for incest) to describe a child of the union between a Jew and a pagan (cf. Deut. 23:2-3) or to a child born of rape or incest., 704085=\u25a3 \"to Me\" Notice the personal element (cf. Isa. 44:22, very similar to John's Gospel). It is God who we need more than any of His gifts. Covenant faith is personal! Truth is personal (cf. John 8:32; 14:6)., 530755=\u25a3 \"had an understanding of the vision\" This was Daniel's gift (cf. 7:15, 28; 8:27), but even so he still needed an angelic interpreter., 1105176=\u25a3 \"You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the Lord\" This refers to the punishment for false prophets from Deut. 13:1-10; 18:20,22. The only difference is that in v. 3 the offender is pierced, while in Deuteronomy they are stoned., 273104=5:28 \"the Medes and the Persians\" This shows the historicity of the book of Daniel. Once Cyrus II became the monarch of the Fertile Crescent, the order was changed to the Persians and the Medes instead of the Medes and Persians (cf. J. C. Whitcomb, Darius the Mede, p. 127). This phrase also shows that these two empires are seen as one entity in Daniel., 504888=2.\u00a0the introduction of \"a son of man\" in 7:13 being given an eternal kingdom, 887558=7:1 \"fourth year of King Darius\" This is almost two years later than the initial eight visions (cf. 1:1,7). The dating of this chapter is very specific., 275298=1.\u00a0Darius means \"royal one\" (in the Avesta \"dar,\" which may be a throne name like Hadad for Syria, Pharaoh for Egypt, and Abimelech for Philistia) and is another name for Cyrus II (the Great), who was also about sixty years of age. For the first year of their reign eastern monarchs often used a throne name (i.e. Tiglath Pileser III was known as Pul and Shalmaneser V was known as Ululai, cf. Joyce G. Baldwin, Daniel, The Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries, p. 127, footnote #5). Cyrus was half Median by race and took the title \"king of the Medes\" at his defeat of Astyages (Cyrus' father-in-law), king of Media, in 549 b.c. (D. J. Wiseman, Darius\" in The New Bible Dictionary, p. 293 and Notes on Some Problems in the Book of Daniel, pp. 12ff). The Septuagint in 11:1 substitutes \"Cyrus\" for \"Darius the Mede.\", 1092252=1.\u00a0the term land stands for the inhabitants of the land, as in v. 12 and 13:8, 842953=5:7 \"lead cover\" There are two views about the lead covered basket., 695332=1:1 \"In the eighth month of the second year\" This refers to October or November of either 520 or 519 b.c., depending on whether one uses the Syrian or Babylonian calendar. The Jews had been back in Palestine for eighteen years at this point. The temple rebuilding, which had begun under Sheshbazzar (Ezra 5:16), had not been finished under Zerubbabel., 297290=\u25a3 \"(now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem)\" These roof chambers were used as summer sleeping quarters (cf. James M. Freeman, Manners and Customs of the Bible, pp. 171-172). Apparently for Daniel it was a place of where he prayed three times a day facing the ancient, destroyed city of Jerusalem (cf. I Kgs. 8:44,48; II Chr. 6:34,38; Ps. 28:2; 138:2)., 897072=7:8 Is this a textual marker to designate a new context? Joyce Baldwin, in Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries, says it is an editorial addition that misunderstood the unity of the passage (cf. p. 145)., 422717=3.\u00a0visions, Job 7:14 (4:13-14); Dan. 7:28; 8:27, 708741=1:6 \"My servants the prophets\" Initially the Patriarchs are designated \"servants\" (e.g. Gen. 18:5). However, it came to refer to the family of Abraham collectively (i.e. Jacob, Israel, cf. Isa. 41:8,9; 42:1,19; 43:10; 44:1,2); then specifically to David the king of united Israel (e.g. II Sam. 7:5,8,19,20; Isa. 37:35). The phrase is used often in II Kings (cf. 9:7; 17:13,23; 21:10; 24:2) for God's speakers, the prophets. The phrase is also used extensively of the prophets in Jeremiah (cf. 7:25; 25:4; 26:5; 29:19; 35:15). It is obvious from the number of allusions in this context that Zechariah knew Jeremiah's writings well., 596891=11:8 \"and also their gods\" Ptolemy III, when he invaded Syria and Babylon, recovered the Egyptian's idols that had been taken by Cambyses II in 524 b.c. By restoring these Egyptian idols, he became a very popular Egyptian ruler., 747620=1.\u00a0the prophet himself (e.g. 1:9,21; 2:2), 631124=11:44 \"the rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him\" Those interpreters who see this context as referring to Antiochus IV Epiphanes believe that this refers to the invasion of the Parthians or a rebellion somewhere in his realm., 372897=7:24 The specificity of this verse has caused problems for commentators who try to take it literally. Apocalyptic literature is notoriously ambiguous and uses a form of hyperbolic stylized language (see D. Brent Sandy, Plowshares and Pruning Hooks: Rethinking the Language of Biblical Prophecy and Apocalyptic, IVP, 2002)., 590378=This idiom is repeated in v. 5, where it refers to the extent of the reign. Brown, Driver, Briggs see II Kgs. 20:13 and Isa. 39:2 as parallel (BDB 606)., 392441=4.\u00a0Rome, 2:44,45, 1126647=14:2 \"For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle\" Notice the emphasis is on God's control of history (cf. v. 9; 12:2,3,6,9; Ps. 2; Isa. 8:9-10; 17:12-14; Ezek. 38-39; Joel 3:9-17; Rev. 16:14-16; 19:17-19)., 765354=\u25a3 \"against the nations\" This refers to 1:15, where God promises to restore His people to the Promised Land (cf. Gen. 12:1-3) and punish the surrounding nations., 126337=2:18, 700313=1:2 \"The Lord was very angry with your fathers\" The word \"anger\" (BDB 893) appears twice in v. 2 and has an intensified connotation, \"was very angry\" (cf. vv. 14-15). This is an anthropomorphic phrase putting human emotions on God, and yet, human vocabulary is the only means we have to understand and communicate thoughts about God. For the term \"Lord\" see Special Topic at Dan. 4:2., 887775=\u25a3 \"the fourth day of the ninth month\" This would possibly be December 7, 518 b.c. (cf. UBS, A Handbook on Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi, p. 180)., 307875=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:6:25-27 \u00a025Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every language who were living in all the land: \"May your peace abound! 26I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel; \u00a0For He is the living God and enduring forever, \u00a0And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed, \u00a0And His dominion will be forever. \u00a0\u00a027He delivers and rescues and performs signs and wonders \u00a0In heaven and on earth, \u00a0Who has also delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.\", 889459=The Hebrew is very ambiguous. There are several theories: (1) King James translates \"Bethel\" as \"the house of God,\" not a town; (2) RSV, TEV, NIV and JB have \"Bethel,\" which is a cultic city about twelve miles north of Jerusalem and the center of calf worship during 922-722 b.c.; (3) NEB combines \"Bethel\" and \"Sharezer\" into one name. Similar compounds using Sharezer are found in Jer. 39:3, while compound names using Bethel are found in Babylonian documents and in the Elephantine Papyri (cf. W. F. Albright, Archaeology and the Religion of Israel, p. 169); (4) the term \"Regemmelech\" (BDB 920) means \"the king's spokesman\" in Ugaritic (the Syriac translation has \"Rab-mag,\" which is an official title, cf. Jer. 39:3,13), which implies that Darius or influential Jews sent two men (i.e. Bether-Sharezer and Regem-Melech)., 975800=\u25a3 \"And he will speak peace to the nations\" This latter part of v. 10 seems to reflect Ps. 72:8-11, where the peace of Palestine is used in a universal sense of the reign of the Messiah. However, it is significant that the Messiah will speak peace to all the nations as well as the Jews (e.g. 8:20-23; Isa. 2:2-4; Micah 4:1-3; 5:4). This surprising, yet prophesied inclusion (cf. Gen. 12:3; 18:18; 22:16; Exod. 19:5), is the ultimate fulfillment of Gen. 3:15, which relates to all humanity, not only the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob!, 483350=A third option is to see it as referring to the time of Jesus (His Incarnation and earthly life), which would limit it to the fifth kingdom of 2:35, 44-45; 7:9-10, 13-14, 18, 22, 27. This is the option I feel most comfortable with at this point in my study. Passages like this must remain tentative!, 1021468=\u25a3 \"their heart will be glad as if from wine\" Psalm 104:15 says that wine is a gift from God to gladden the hearts of men. In Zech. 9:15 it described victorious soldiers. Here it is also a metaphor of joy for military victory provided by YHWH., 138600=This same term (BDB 1087) describes the fourth beast in Dan. 7:7., 920727=It is used of the activity of God on behalf of His people (cf. 8:7,13; 9:16; 10:6; 12:7). YHWH delivers those who trust Him (e.g. v. 6; Ps. 37:40; 86:2)., 625558=2.\u00a0wonderful actions by God, Exod. 3:20; Josh. 3:5, 106991=\u25a3 \"Nebuchadnezzar\" See note at 1:1., 392388=3.\u00a0Greece, 8:21, 262375=5:11 \"There is a man in your kingdom\" Verse 7 is an example again of the failure of the Babylonian wise men to accurately know the heart and mind of the one true God. God did, however, provide a source of revelation, even to these Babylonian monarchs. That source was Daniel, one of the captives of Judah (cf. v. 13)., 337980=a.\u00a0the image in 2:31 and translated \"awesome\", 646772=\u25a3 \"everyone who is found\" There has been much discussion among commentators because of this universal element implied by \"everyone\" but contrasted with the word \"many,\" found in vv. 2 and 10 (cf. 11:33,39). Verse 10 helps to interpret the \"many\" of verse 2. They both refer to the redeemed, the faithful, the followers of Messiah., 713702=6.\u00a0\"he showed me,\" 3:1, 41934=B.\u00a0Daniel is the interpreter of dreams and counselor to kings of neo-Babylon and Persia until the time of Cyrus II, \"the great\" (538 b.c., cf. 1:21; 6:28; 10:1). W. F. Albright, Journal of Biblical Literature, pp. 40, 1921, asserts a Babylonian flavor to chapter one through seven. He believes they were written in Babylonia., 905080=7:14 \"I scattered\" God is in control of history! This refers to the Exile., 812712=4:6 \"Zerubbabel\" There is some confusion connected with Zerubbabel., 239083=4:37 \"praise, exalt and honor\" As is characteristic of Daniel several synonymous terms are used to make a strong emphasis., 200222=4:2 \"the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me.\" Nebuchadnezzar II has now been confronted with YHWH in chapters 2, 3, and 4. The accumulating evidence of the existence, sovereignty, and covenant loyalty of the Jewish God is overwhelming., 772934=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:2:13 \u00a013\"Be silent, all flesh, before the Lord; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\", 429424=8:21 \"the shaggy goat. . .Greece\" In 8:5 there is a Hebrew construct for male goat (BDB 862 and 777). In 8:21 there are two words which the Handbook on the Book of Daniel, from the Untied Bible Societies, says is made up of the Hebrew word for male goat (BDB 972 II) and the Aramaic word for he-goat (BDB 862), which are in opposition, p. 222. The ADJECTIVE form of this term means \"hairy,\" therefore, the additional word \"shaggy\" in 8:21. This additional term usually refers to the goats offered as a sin-sacrifice (cf. Lev. 4:23,24; 9:15; 16:5,7-8; Num. 7:16)., 797415=\u25a3 \"the Branch\" This may be \"sprout\" (BDB 855). This is another Messianic title (cf. 6:12; Isa. 4:2; 11:1; 53:2; Jer. 23:5; 33:15). See full discussion and SPECIAL TOPIC: JESUS THE NAZARENE at Dan. 4:15., 508698=\u25a3 \"the people of the Prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary\" Here the term \"prince\" (BDB 617) means \"leader\" (cf. TEV). This same term was used in v. 25 as a description of Messiah; here it means just the opposite, His oppressor (e.g. Lion of Judah of Rev. 5:5 vs. roaring lion of I Pet. 5:8; white horse of Rev. 6 vs. white horse of Rev. 19). This leader brings destruction on Jerusalem and the temple; as did Nebuchadnezzar and Antiochus IV, so too, will Titus and possibly an end-time Antichrist (cf. Matt. 24:2; Mark 13:2; Luke 19:43-44). Multiple fulfillment prophecy can be seen in, 625646=3.\u00a0difficult, Gen. 18:14; Deut. 30:11; Jer. 32:17,27, 554950=10:17 This is obviously symbolic language describing Daniel's awe at the vision he has seen and the majesty of the angelic visitor. This figurative hyperbolic language is characteristic of apocalyptic literature., 860230=The phrase, \"the four winds\" is also used in Jer. 49:36; Dan. 7:2; 11:4; Rev. 7:1 in a universal sense., 1019849=\u25a3 \"they will be as though I had not rejected them\" This verse surely speaks of God's forgiveness and restoration, but it also denotes that YHWH broke the covenant because of His people's sins. It is so difficult to talk about the mercy and forgiveness of God while at the same time reminding humans that the covenant is conditional. God desires fellowship with a holy people. He wants a holy people to reflect His character to a lost world. The old covenant was performance based (cf. Deut. 27-29), but fallen humans were incapable of obedience (cf. Rom.7 and Gal. 3). Therefore, the New Covenant (cf. Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 36:22-38) is based on the gracious, unchanging character of YHWH (cf. Mal. 3:6), the work of the Messiah, and the drawing power of the Spirit (cf. John 6:44,65). The goal is still a righteous people, but the mechanism of that righteousness has changed., 413967=8:12 \"on account of transgression\" Some see this as: (1) the sins of the Jewish people (cf. 9:24) which God allowed to be punished by a foreign leader (cf. Isa. 10:5; Jer. 51:20); (2) the sins of Jewish leadership which helped Antiochus; or more probably in this context (3) Antiochus IV Epiphanes' sin (cf. vv. 13,23)., 392330=2.\u00a0Medo-Persia, 8:20, 180571=3:22 \"the furnace had been made extremely hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who carried them in\" This is a graphic detail of the extreme heat into which the three Hebrew boys were thrown. The fall itself should have killed them, much less the temperature., 1136170=14:9 \"the Lord will be king\" This continues the motif of YHWH as King of the earth (cf. 14:16,17; I Sam. 8:7; 12:12; Ps. 93:1; 97:1; 99:1). In 9:9 it is the Messiah who is king (cf. Isa. 9:6-7; Jer. 10:7; 23:5). YHWH does not become King. He has always been King, but now all humans recognize it (cf. Matt. 6:10)., 353339=7:13 \"behold with the clouds of heaven\" The Septuagint has the PREPOSITION \"on,\" but the Aramaic has the preposition \"with.\" Does this affect the theological aspect of this \"one like a son of man\" (human-like) being described with divine qualities (i.e. riding on the clouds of heaven)? Let us remember, 361345=\u25a3 \"within me\" The marginal note of NASB, \"in the midst of its sheath\" (BDB 1102) is a Semitic idiom that later translators did not understand. Daniel had both \"a spirit of the holy gods\" (cf. 4:8,9,18; 5:11,14), as well as an anxious human spirit., 149724=2:46 King Nebuchadnezzar pays homage to Daniel as the representative of the God who has revealed this truth. This does not refer to the worship of Daniel or he would not have allowed it., 650611=\u25a3 \"in the dust of the ground\" This Hebrew idiom is a play on the word \"ground,\" adanah (BDB 9) and dust (BDB 779) from Gen. 2:7 and 3:19 (cf. Ps. 90:3; 104:29). The dust of the ground is metaphorically the holding place of the dead (i.e. Sheol, e.g. I Sam. 2:6; Job 14:13; Ps. 30:3; 49:14-15; 139:8; Isa. 38:10; Hos. 13:14; Amos 9:2)., 929459=8:14 \"I have not relented\" The Hebrew VERB (BDB 636, KB 688), in its Niphal PERFECT form, means \"to be sorry,\" \"to console oneself.\" YHWH was patient with His people. He relented the punishment that they deserved (cf. Amos 7:3,6), but there was a limit to His relenting (cf. Jer. 15:8). There came a time when YHWH disciplined His people and He did not relent (cf. 8:14; Ezek. 24:14), but He wanted to (cf. Jer. 26:3,13; Hos. 11:8)., 1092101=12:12 \"And the land will mourn\" This could mean several things., 1132304=14:6, 505012=3.\u00a0the redemptive clauses of 9:24 which point toward a culmination of fallen world history, 556919=\u25a3 \"take courage and be courageous\" This is YHWH's message to Joshua after Moses' death (cf. Josh. 1:6,7,9). Humans need these words of encouragement. The spiritual realm is overwhelming!, 541887=\u25a3 \"stand upright\" This is similar to Ezek. 2:1. Daniel was first on his face, then on his hands and knees, and now he must stand up and hear the message., 227759=4:27 Daniel's advice to Nebuchadnezzar recognizes the biblical world-view (OT) that there is a holy God who requires righteousness. These words to a proud eastern monarch shows the basic ethical nature of reality. This reflects the covenant of Deut. 27-29. Sin and rebellion are the problem, but God is a God of mercy (cf. Isa. 55:6-7; Ezek. 18:21-22). These words to Nebuchadnezzar show Daniel's understanding that pagans are loved by God and can respond to Him by faith and life., 198310=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:4:1-3 \u00a01Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and men of every language that live in all the earth: \"May your peace abound! 2It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me. \u00a03How great are His signs \u00a0And how mighty are His wonders! \u00a0His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom \u00a0And His dominion is from generation to generation.\", 167187=3:5,7,10 \"at the moment you hear the sound of\" This list of musical instruments refers to the Babylonian national orchestra. This may have been the Babylonian national anthem (cf. 10). We have a record from Babylonian documents of a similar party where 150 musicians played. It is obvious that the neo-Babylonians enjoyed music and included it in all of their festive occasions., 792976=3:6 Notice the angel of the LORD either speaks on YHWH's behalf as the prophet does (cf. 2:9,11; 4:9; 6:15) or this is a Messianic reference. It is hard to decide, but I think it is YHWH Himself speaking through the angel., 411777=8:11 \"It even magnified itself to be equal with the Commander of the host\" One characteristic of these Gentile kings has been their arrogance. The influence of the fall (cf. Gen. 3) continues!, 1046648=11:6 \"For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land\" This language is similar to Hosea 1:6-9; 2:1-23. Hosea was told to live his life (i.e. marry a prostitute) in order to model YHWH's love for faithless Israel. Zechariah, or the future Messiah, is also modeling YHWH's attitudes! The Jewish leaders were to model God's leadership., 724816=The Hebrew term \"compassion\" or \"mercy\" (BDB 933) is used in Hosea 1:6,19, and 23 as a word play between God's judgment (i.e. divorce) of His people and His promised renewal of the covenant., 120778=2.\u00a02:12, \"indignant and very furious\", 325596=a.\u00a0head of man, Dan. 3:27, 630999=11:43 \"Libyans and Ethiopians\" These were allies with Egypt., 812921=a.\u00a0son of Shealtiel (cf. Ezra 3:2,8; 5:2; Neh. 12:1; Hag. 1:1,12,14; 2:2,23), 382851=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:7:28 \u00a028\"At this point the revelation ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my face grew pale, but I kept the matter to myself.\", 757319=\u25a3 \"I have dispersed\" This VERB (BDB 831, KB 975, Piel PERFECT) could refer to the exiles of 722 or 586 b.c., but possibly also to the last days (cf. 1:17; 2:4,11)., 346027=\u25a3 \"the hair of His head like pure wool\" This refers to the wisdom of the aged (of Jesus in Rev. 1:14). The \"white\" and \"bright\" of these two lines of poetry speak of both wisdom and holiness (cf. the Judgment scene of Isa. 1:18-20), which gives God the right and authority to judge (i.e. white throne judgment of Rev. 20:11; Jesus on a white horse as Judge in Rev. 19:11,14)., 173588=3:12 \"namely, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego\" It is uncertain where Daniel was at this time. It could be that he was sick or on a governmental assignment. This would be unusual because all the other government officials were present., 784843=\u25a3 \"Satan\" This is literally \"the adversary\" (BDB 966, KB 1316, cf. Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; I Chr. 21:1). In I Kgs. 22:19ff, Satan is also before YHWH in heaven as one of the angelic attendants. The Bible often uses a court metaphor to describe activity in heaven (cf. Hos. 2; Ezek. 23; Rev. 4-5)., 650389=The concept of death as sleep is also found in the NT (e.g. Matt. 27:52 [note resurrection]; John 11:11 [note resurrection in 11:25-26; 13:36; Acts 7:60; I Thess. 4:13 [note resurrection in 4:14-17]; 5:10)., 378541=7:26, 627610=11:38 \"But instead he will honor a god of fortresses\" There seems to be a contradiction between v. 37, where he will reject \"gods,\" and v. 38, where he will follow \"a god of fortresses.\" Many commentators believe that the phrase \"a god of fortresses\" is simply a way of talking about warfare. The concluding part of v. 38, which seems to speak of military booty, seems to reinforce this theory., 327510=\u25a3 \"the great sea. . .the sea\" There have been several theories of the meaning of this phrase: (1) it refers literally to the Mediterranean Ocean (cf. Num. 34:6, 7; Joshua 9:1) (2) it refers metaphorically to the nations of the earth (cf. v. 17; Ps. 65:7; Isa. 17:12-13; 57:20; Rev. 17:15); or (3) it refers to the initial watery chaos which was part of creation (cf. Gen. 1:2; 7:11; 49:25; Ps. 36:6; Isa. 51:10; Amos 7:4). As always context determines meaning. Here it refers to the known world of the ancient Near East, that part of the world which affects the people of God and the Promised Land., 611917=11:24 \"he will enter the richest parts of the realm\" Some commentators say that this refers to Egypt while others say it refers to the taxation of his own land as his predecessor, Seleucus IV, had done before (cf. v. 20)., 840995=5:5 \"lift up now your eyes and see\" This literary phrase (esp. \"see\") introduces a new vision. See note at 1:8., 474333=\u25a3 \"let Thy face shine on\" This reflects the blessing formula of Num. 6:24,26, which is also reflected in Ps. 80:3,7,19., 858705=From these English translations it is obvious there are two options: (1) the color of the horses (but different from the ones mentioned in 1:8) or (2) the strength of the horses. The Hebrew term (BDB 55) means \"strength\" or \"might\" and probably applies to all of the horses, not the color of the last horse (BDB 136, spotted or dappled, cf. Gen. 31:10,12)., 77930=1:5, 706716=\u25a3 \"But they did not listen or give heed to Me\" The two negated VERBS \"listen\"(BDB 1033, KB 1570) and \"give heed\" (BDB 904, KB 1151) reflect Deut. 6:4, which denotes hearing and obeying (cf. Deut. 5:32-33; 6:1-3). It is not enough to know God's words, they must be lived out (cf. James 1:22-25)!, 422537=1.\u00a0God, Gen. 17:3; Job 13:11,21; Ezek. 1:28; 3:23; 44:4, 493112=2.\u00a0sin, 9:20,24, 175799=3:14 Nebuchadnezzar II tries to give them a second chance (cf. v. 15, they were excellent administrators), but their refusal just proves to intensify his anger. He took their rejection of his gods as a personal rejection., 644964=1.\u00a0present oneself, 1:4, 415870=\u25a3 \"How long\" This does not refer to Jeremiah's prophecy about a seventy year exile (cf. 9:2; Jer. 25:11,12; 29:10; Zech. 7:5). It is connected to the \"little horn\" of the third empire (i.e. Greece, cf. 8:21), which is being discussed in vv. 9-14. Therefore, this time frame is related to the atrocities of Antiochus IV (175-164 b.c.), who desecrated the temple and attempted to force individual, faithful Jews to become Hellenists., 1099238=13:1 \"In that day\" This is the repeated eschatological marker of chapters 10-14 (cf. 13:2)., 409307=8:10 \"to the host of heaven\" The PREPOSITION \"to\" is translated in poetry as \"as far as,\" \"even to,\" or \"up to\" (cf. v. 11)., 177945=3:18 \"but even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.\" They believed that God was able, but they were not being presumptuous by demanding a miracle. They had faith in God, not in circumstances., 615721=11:29 \"at the appointed time\" This is the recurrent theological theme of the book of Daniel, that God is in total control of time and history (cf. vv. 27,29,35,36,45; 8:19)., 1042584=4.\u00a0trees, Zech. 11:2, 877942=6:15 \"those who are far off\" Historically this refers to (1) the Jews of the Diaspora (cf. in the Fertile Crescent and Egypt; (2) the Persian court, possibly represented by the three men of vv. 10 and 14; and (3) eschatologically it refers to the Gentiles (cf. 2:11; 8:20-23; Isa. 2:2-4; 56:6-8; 60:5c-9,10; Micah 4:1-5; Eph. 2:11-22)., 277161=\u25a3 \"received the kingdom\" It is uncertain if this means that he received (BDB 1110, Pael PERFECT) the kingdom from God or from Cyrus II (cf. 9:1)., 1019451=This Hebrew VERB (BDB 933, KB 1216, Piel PERFECT) is used often for God's compassion on His people (cf. Exod. 33:19; Deut. 30:3; II Kgs. 13:23; Isa. 14:1; 30:18; 49:10,13; 54:8,10; 55:7; 60:10; Jer. 12:15; 30:18; 31:20; 33:26; Hos. 1:6-7; 2:19,23; Micah 7:18-20). This word assured them that YHWH had reestablished the covenant with all of its benefits!, 180124=The construct (BDB 1086 and 1093) implies his strongest military guards. Nebuchadnezzar's anger will result in the death of these servants (cf. v. 22)., 1011758=\u25a3 \"For the Lord of hosts\" See SPECIAL TOPIC: NAMES FOR DEITY at Dan. 4:2., 552863=2.\u00a0Daniel, 8:17, 537337=\u25a3 \"his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze\" This is used of the cherubim's feet in Ezek. 1:7 and of the exalted Christ in Rev. 1:15; 2:15. All of these descriptions emphasize the brightness or radiance of the angel. He was dressed as those who are close to God., 782713=\u25a3 \"standing before\" This word (BDB 763, KB 840, Qal ACTIVE PARTICIPLE) can be understood in this context in two distinct ways: (1) for priestly service (cf. Deut. 10:8; II Chr. 29:11; Ezek. 44:11,15, i.e. Joshua acting as High Priest on behalf of the nation) or (2) legal usage of someone brought before a judge (cf. Num. 27:2; Deut. 19:17; Josh. 20:6; I Kgs. 3:16, i.e. Joshua as sinful representative of all Jews)., 1076755=This cognate VERB and NOUN (BDB 976, KB 1355, Niphil IMPERFECT) mean \"to scratch\" or \"cut.\" The pagan nations practiced ritual cutting (cf. Lev. 19:28; 21:5), but Israel was forbidden to do this. Now the eschatological judgment on these attacking pagan nations will be \"cutting\" or \"scratching\" (irony)., 184749=3:28 \"who put their trust in Him\" Not only is the One True God emphasized, but also the need for personal, active trust in Him (cf. Isa. 26:3-4)!, 217734=4:15 \"a band of iron\" There has been much discussion about the band. Most commentators assume that it was for the protection of the stump, although some see it as being related to the restraints that bound Nebuchadnezzar during the time that he was deranged., 427033=\u25a3 \"he touched me\" The angel's touch was a great comfort (cf. 10:10,16,18; I Kgs. 19:7; Rev. 1:17)., 979720=\u25a3 \"I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit\" The VERB (BDB 1018, KB 1511) is a Piel PERFECT. Apparently this is a metaphor describing the returning Jewish exiles (cf. Isa. 24:22; 51:14)., 675891=2.\u00a0the use of the VOCATIVE (2:7,10; 3:2,8; 4:7; 9:9,13; 11:1-2; 13:7), 662635=4.\u00a0those who lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever, 12:3, 83873=1:8 \"not defile himself\" Two possibilities are: (1) because the food had been offered to Babylonian idols or (2) because of restraints of the Jewish food laws (cf. Lev. 11: Deut. 14). It is surprising that Daniel did not object to (1) his name change, which reflects a pagan god or (2) his study of magic texts, but he did express his Jewish tradition in relation to his diet. It is interesting that both Joseph and Moses faced similar cross-cultural experiences in Egypt. There were precedents!, 825638=4:13 \"my lord\" This is Zechariah's normal term (adoni) of address to the angelic guide (cf. 1:9,19; 4:4,5,13)., 1017556=10:6 Notice the parallelism in the first two lines. God will unify His people (i.e. \"Judah\" and \"Joseph\"). Also notice the parallelism of the VERBAL form in which the first person PRONOUN is inherit of the first three lines. His people are \"strengthened\" (BDB 149, KB 175 Piel PERFECT) and \"saved\" (BDB 446, KB 448, Hiphil IMPERFECT) because He acts! The entire verse reflects God's sovereignty, past, present, and future., 147191=\u25a3 \"set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed\" This phrase is not related to the millennium which is a specific period of time (cf. Rev. 20:1-6). This looks at a far wider scope of history in which the kingdom of God will be established when the Messiah will set up a perpetual, eternal kingdom (cf. II Sam. 7:13,16; Ps. 45:6; 89:36-37; Isa. 9:7; Dan. 4:3; 6:26; 7:14,18; Micah 5:2-5a; Luke 1:33; II Pet. 1:11; Rev. 11:15)., 669421=12:13 \"go your way. . .enter into rest\" Daniel is told to quit wrestling with this, to leave it alone, and to live out his normal life until his death (cf. v. 9). But the great hope of v. 13 is the assumption that he (and all who believe) will rise again unto an end-time reward. Hallelujah!, 1092531=\u25a3 \"every family by itself\" This is a continuing emphasis on the gravity and extent of the mourning. The royal family is mentioned, David and his son Nathan (cf. II Sam. 5:14; I Chr. 3:5; 14:4; Luke 3:31; this is the line of David [i.e. Judah]). Levi and his son (Shimeites) are mentioned in Num. 3:18; I Chr. 6:17. The royal family and the priestly family (Shimeites were Levites, cf. Exod. 6:16-17; Num. 3:12-18,21) are uniquely involved in this mourning as representatives of the entire people. It is also possible to note that Zechariah combined the royal and priestly roles (cf. chapters 3 & 4, as well as 6:9-15)., 765033=Zechariah asserts this conviction that prophetic fulfillment of YHWH's message and promises are sure and certain. The phrase \"you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me\" (cf. 2:9,11; 4:9; 6:15) is an idiom of confidence!, 654842=\u25a3 \"like the brightness of the expanse of heaven\" These are parallel metaphors. The first one may refer to (1) the height of God's portable throne (cf. Ezek. 1:22) or (2) the Hebrew word (BDB 956) means \"an extended surface.\" It is used to describe the vault of the sky in Gen. 1:6,7,8 and in v. 14 to the great lights (sun, moon, stars, comets, etc.)., 919031=\u25a3 \"the remnant of this people\" The Hebrew term \"remnant\" (BDB 984) basically means \"the remainder,\" \"what is left,\" \"the residue.\" In the prophets it takes on a special meaning, \"the faithful remnant,\" which refers to the few descendants of Abraham who believed, trusted, and worshiped YHWH. It is these He would restore (cf. Isa. 37:4,32; 46:3; Jer. 23:3; 31:7; Micah 2:15; 5:7,8; 7:18; Zeph. 2:7,9; Ezra 9:14; Zech. 8:6,11,12). The difficulty about this term is the time factor. Does it refer to (1) the post-exilic period or (2) the end-time (notice the phrase in Zech. 8:6, \"in those days\")? This may be an example of multiple fulfillment prophecy., 349916=7:11 \"the sound of boastful words\" This refers to the \"little horn\" of the fourth kingdom (cf. vv. 7-8). Arrogance was Nebuchadnezzar's problem in 4:28-31; 5:20 and also Belshazzar's in 5:22-23. This arrogant attitude characterizes unbelieving Gentile powers (i.e. the little horn of the third kingdom of 8:11 and here the little horn of the fourth kingdom, cf. v. 8)., 422630=2.\u00a0angels, Dan. 8:17; 10:9,10,12,15,19; Rev. 1:17, 652645=\u25a3 \"everlasting. . .everlasting\" This is the Hebrew word olam (BDB 761), which must be interpreted in light of the intent and perspective of this permanent division in Matt. 25:46 (i.e. heaven - hell). There has been a recent book on annihilationism that brings up some interesting points. See Edward Fudge, The Fire That Consumes: A Biblical and Historical Study of the Doctrine of Final Punishment, but also note Millard J. Erickson, Christian Theology, 2nd ed., pp. 1244-1247., 455649=3.\u00a0Ashes - This seems to have started as a sign of mourning in Josh. 7:6 and developed into a tradition (cf. I Sam. 4:12; II Sam. 1:2; 13:19)., 1007996=\u25a3 \"the diviners see lying visions\" This is a Qal ACTIVE PARTICIPLE (BDB 890, KB 1115, \"the ones divining\") plus a Qal PERFECT VERB (BDB 302, KB 301, \"see lies\"). Most of these false methods of attempting to find the will of God are mentioned in Deut. 18:9-13, esp. v. 10 (cf. II Kgs. 17:17). Divining is especially mentioned in I Sam. 15:23. It either refers to natural (e.g. flight of birds, clouds, sheep livers) or manmade (e.g. casting sticks, tea leaves) means of determining the will of God (cf. Ezek. 21:21). Here this term (BDB 890) refers to false prophets (cf. Isa. 3:2; Jer. 27:9; 29:8; Ezek. 13:9,23; 22:38; Micah 3:11)., 472079=9:15 \"who brought Thy people out of the land of Egypt\" The Exodus fulfilled God's promise of Gen. 15:12-21. The symbolism from Gen. 15 conveys the concept that God and God alone can accomplish this act of deliverance and promise. In point of fact the OT is as much an account of YHWH's grace and mercy as is the NT. The character of God has not changed (cf. Mal.3:6), but the covenant requirements have been modified because of mankind's (even redeemed) inability to keep the covenant (cf. Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 36:22-38). The covenant is still conditional, but structured so that the Messiah's performance replaces human performance as the means and basis of redemption (cf. Isa. 53; II Cor. 5:21)., 1050840=\u25a3 \"I took my two staffs. . .Favor. . .Union\" From Ps. 23:4 we learn that shepherds usually carry one large, crooked-necked staff to control the sheep, and one war club in their belt to fight off predators. Here, the shepherd obviously carried two large, crooked-necked staffs (BDB 596). One is called \"pleasantness\" (BDB 653), while the other one is called \"union\" or \"binding cords\" (BDB 287). These staffs stand for God's attempt to reunite Israel and Judah (cf. v. 14; 9:13; 10:6)., 810215=4:2 \"What do you see\" This Hebrew word \"see\" (BDB 906, KB 1157) is a literary marker for a new vision. It is used three times in this verse. See full note at 1:8., 348000=\u25a3 \"thousands upon thousands were attending Him\" If verse 10, c and d, are parallel (i.e. \"10,000 x 10,000), some have assumed that these were angels who serve God (cf. v. 10c) because of v. 16 and Deut. 33:2 (cf. Heb. 12:22; Rev. 5:11). Others have assumed that they are humans awaiting judgment (cf. v. 10d) or perhaps saints because of vv. 18, 22, and 27. This phrase is alluded to in Jude v. 14., 545853=\u25a3 \"one of the chief princes\" This ADJECTIVE (BDB 911) is used in the sense of \"first in rank.\" Michael is called \"the archangel\" in Jude 9, while in Rev. 12:7-9, he leads an angelic army against the dragon (Satan) and his angels. The only other place this terminology is used is in the rapture passage of I Thess. 4:16., 392495=5.\u00a0The Eternal Kingdom of God, 2:35,44-45; 7:9-10,13-14,18,22,27, 330661=Notice how often in this verse divine action is directed toward the Gentile empire: \"wings were plucked\" (BDB 1101, Piel PERFECT); \"it was lifted up\" (BDB 1102, Piel PERFECT); \"made to stand\" (BDB 1110, Hoph PERFECT); and \"human mind also was given to it\" (Piel PRESENT) [this is true of \"was raised up on one side,\" cf. v. 5]. God is in complete control (cf. 2:20). Some commentators believe that these actions reflect Nebuchadnezzar's madness in chapter 4. Although this is possible, again interpreters must be careful of trying to find a historical referent to all the details of Daniel's visions., 435742=\u25a3 \"he will even oppose the Prince of princes\" The VERB (BDB 763, KB 840) is a Qal IMPERFECT. This same word, \"prince\" (BDB 978, cf. 8:11,25; 10:13,21; 12:1) is translated \"commander\" in v. 11 and seems in context to refer to YHWH (cf. Josh. 5:12-15). The Hebrew word does not imply a crown prince, co-regent, or ruler in waiting as it does in English, but the chief leader. It is used of the Messiah in Isa. 9:6,7; of Michael the Archangel (cf. Jude 9); and of Israel in 10:13,21; 12:1., 874105=6:13 This seems to combine in one person both kingly and priestly offices (cf. Ps. 104:1,4). Others see v. 13 as an emphasis on two offices (i.e. two thrones). This would attribute to Zerubbabel the rebuilding of the temple, and to Joshua, sitting and co-ruling (both VERBS Qal PERFECTS) in it., 1079275=In the ancient Near East, cavalry and chariots were the most powerful and feared military weapon, but YHWH will overpower them (cf. 10:5; 12:4; 14:15; Hag. 2:22), and remove them, even those of Ephraim and Judah, 9:10. He is the victor!, 380495=This shows the two ways this phrase is understood (cf. a similar Hebrew phrase in 8:24). The NKJV and TEV translations make \"people\" and \"saints\" parallel (appositional). If the NASB is followed then angels seem to be the referent of \"holy ones\" or \"saints\" in this verse, which would relate it to the national angels of Deut. 32:8, in this case, to Michael and Gabriel and other angels (cf. Dan. 10) that serve God and His people. Some commentators even see \"Son of Man\" in v. 13 as referring to these same angels. Daniel, as all apocalyptic literature, pictures angels as intimately involved with God's dealings with humanity., 713260=3.\u00a0\"I lifted my eyes and looked,\" 1:18, 535298=\u25a3 \"gold of Uphaz\" This could refer to a place of origin (cf. Jer. 10:9, possibly the same as Ophir of I Kgs. 9:28; I Chr. 29:4; Job 22:24; 28:16; Isa. 13:12) or a grade of smelted ore (cf. I Kgs. 10:18), but this would require a textual emendation (cf. TEV, NJB, NIV)., 294974=The Medes are mentioned first here as in 8:20. Persia was the dominant partner and very soon after Cyrus' defeat of Babylon he began to be called King of Persia. The order of these terms shows the historicity of Daniel. The order is reversed in Esther 1:19., 602240=11:14 \"now in those times many will rise up against the kings of the South\" This refers to the reign of Ptolemy IV. He experienced many rebellions in his empire, including one by the Jews, who supported Antiochus III, but none of them succeeded. They were defeated by General Scopas in 200 b.c., 860663=\u25a3 \"the Lord of all the earth\" See note at 4:14., 233146=4:32-33 \"Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled\" His malady is called lycantrophy or boanthrophy (cf. R. K. Harrison's Introduction to the OT, page 1115-1117)., 493165=3.\u00a0iniquity, 9:13,16,24, 662568=3.\u00a0everlasting contempt, 12:2, 124129=2:16 The king is more patient with Daniel's request for time than he was with the group of wise men's request (cf. v. 8)., 552916=3.\u00a0an angel, 10:16, 108733=2:2 \"the king gave orders to call in the\" This is a series of wise men which imply that Nebuchadnezzar called in the entire group of those who claimed to know the will of the gods., 260384=5:8 \"they could not read the inscription\" It is uncertain if the writing was in Aramaic or Hebrew. It seems that they should have been able to read the words, but possibly did not understand their meaning. The words may have been written in consonants only or, as the rabbis say, not horizontally, but vertically. It is obvious that Daniel was needed to interpret the words., 106532=2:1 \"in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar\" Nebuchadnezzar began reigning in 605 b.c., so this would be 604 b.c. Apparently Daniel was still in his three year initial study (cf. 1:4-5), possibly this is why he was not with the group of wise men who the king initially addresses (cf. v. 2)., 660663=12:5 \"Then I, Daniel, looked and behold, two others were standing\" This chapter is a continuation of the literary context which began in chapter 10. In 10:4 two angelic beings were seen standing by the Tigris River. However, the term \"river\" in 10:4 (BDB 625) is the Tigris and the one here in v. 5 (BDB 384) is a different Hebrew word. The one here is most often used for the Nile River. However, there is an exception to this in Isa. 33:21, where it is used of canals., 876034=5.\u00a0Hobab, Jdgs. 4:11, 544075=10:13 \"withstanding me\" This term (BDB 617) means \"to place or stand in front of.\" It is related to the term for \"prince\" (\"the one in front\") in 9:25,26. In this context it is used both positively (cf. v. 16) and negatively (here)., 365518=1.\u00a0\"everlasting kingdom,\" 4:3; 7:27, 975495=9:10 \"And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim\" Verse 9 speaks of Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem, while v. 10 describes the Second Coming. Also notice YHWH speaks (cf. vv. 6,8) in v. 10a,c, but the Messiah is spoken of in 10d-f., 175640=This phrase (BDB 1112 and 1095) is called a hendiadys, which is characteristic of Daniel writing style. See note at 2:12., 988735=The VERB \"defend\" (BDB 170, KB 199, Hiphil IMPERFECT) can be translated \"cover,\" \"surround,\" or \"defend\" (cf. 12:8). In Isa. 31:5 it is used of a mother bird protecting her young (cf. Deut. 32:11; Ps. 91:4). Here it is used as a shield protecting the soldiers from projectiles., 427196=8:19 \"the final period of the indignation\" This term (BDB 276) is used often in Isaiah of YHWH's indignation against His people for their covenant faithlessness; therefore, He punishes them by means of foreign nations (cf. Isa. 10:5-6,25; 13:2-16 [esp. v. 5]). However, His indignation will pass (cf. Isa. 26:20; 30:27; 66:7-24 [esp. v. 14]). This theme is continued in Ezekiel (cf. 21:31; 22:24,31). It is foreshadowed in Deut. 28:49-57., 1087544=The phrase \"a spirit of\" (NRSV, NJB) or \"the Spirit\" (NASB, NKJV) has no ARTICLE in the Hebrew text. This is not a reference to the Holy Spirit, but the human spirit: (1) positive attributes (a) Deut. 34:9, \"filled with the spirit of wisdom\"; (b) Isa. 28:6, \"a spirit of justice\" and (2) negative attributes, (a) Num. 5:14,30, \"a spirit of jealousy\"; (b) Isa. 19:4, \"a spirit of distortion\"; (c) Isa. 29:10, \"a spirit of deep sleep\"; and (d) Hos. 4:12, \"a spirit of harlotry.\" These physically delivered Jewish people will be empowered by God to see and understand their spiritual need and God's redemptive plan., 361191=7:15 These powerful visions of God's power and human evil distressed Daniel (cf. 4:19; 7:28; 8:27)., 275096=5:31 \"Darius the Mede\" This person is unknown to extra-biblical history. There have been two predominant theories., 357480=From The Jewish Study Bible, p. 1657 (also see George E. Ladd, A Theology of the New Testament, pp. 136-139), the later Jewish tradition about this text are listed., 825853=4:14 \"the two anointed ones\" This Hebrew word \"anointed\" (BDB 844 I), which is the word for \"fresh oil,\" was not used for ceremonial anointing. There is another Hebrew word used for ceremonial anointing in the OT (BDB 602), so the literal phrase \"sons of fresh oil\" did not have obvious Messianic (i.e. The Anointed One) connotations. It may have the connotation here of blessed ones or prosperity (cf. 3:10)., 1074732=12:2 \"I am going to make Jerusalem a cup\" It must be seen that this phrase is in the Hebrew parallel relationship with \"Jerusalem a heavy stone\" from v. 3. This phrase means that the unbelieving nations who come against God's people are going to be made drunk and foolish (cf. Jer. 51:7) because of their attacking Jerusalem. The idiom of \"cup\" (several different words) in the Bible usually refers to judgment (cf. Ps 75:8; Isa. 51:17,22; Jer. 25:15-16,27-28; 49:12; Matt. 20:22; 26:39,42; Luke 22:42; John 18:11)., 790642=\u25a3 \"will clothe you with festival robes\" This is a Hiphil INFINITIVE ABSOLUTE. Not only is sin removed, but blessing and status are restored (cf. Luke 15:11-32). Often in the Bible clothing is used as a symbol of our spiritual life (e.g. Job 19:9; 29:4; Ps. 132:9,16,18; Isa. 3:18-24; 52:1; 59:17; 61:10). This is especially true of Paul's writing in I Cor. 15:53-54; Gal. 3:27; Eph. 4:24; 6:11; Col. 3:10,12; and I Thess. 5:8., 227539=This is a circumlocution, a way of referring to deity without using a title/name (cf. Matt. 3:2, \"kingdom of heaven\"; and Luke 15:18,21, \"sinned against heaven\")., 91408=1:20 The Hebrew youths in their conversations with Nebuchadnezzar, proved to be much (the idiomatic use of ten) better than (1) the other youths from other conquered countries who studied with them and (2) even all the established counselors (magicians and conjurers)., 460703=9:6 \"we have not listened to Thy servants the prophets\" The Jews (kings, princes, ancestors, and all the common people) were not ignorant or uninformed about God's covenant will. They had the writings of Moses, the miracles of the Exodus, the victories of the conquest and the fulfillment of the Abrahamic promise of land, but they would not be faithful (cf. II Kgs. 17:13-15; Jer. 44:4,5,21; Hosea 11:2)., 747879=4.\u00a0the Lord Himself (e.g. 1:13,14,15,16,17; 2:5,6-11), 250634=5:1 \"Belshazzar\" In Babylonian Bel-shar-usur means \"Bel, protect the king\" (BDB 1084). Bel means lord\" and is another name for Marduk., 200568=The book of Daniel is characterized by lists and hendiadys. See the third paragraph of 2:12. The corresponding Hebrew terms for \"signs,\" and \"wonders\" are often used together (cf. Exod. 7:3; 8:23; Deut. 4:34; 6:22; 7:19; 13:1,2; 26:8; 28:46; 29:3; 34:11; Neh. 9:10; Ps. 105:27; 135:9; Jer. 32:20). What God did for Israel in the Exodus (cf. Acts 7:36) He now displays to pagan kings (Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, and Darius). The revelation continues in the life of Jesus (cf. Acts 2:22) and the gospel proclamation (cf. Acts 2:43; 4:30; 5:12; 8:13; 14:3). However, in the NT these two terms are usually associated with false Messiahs (cf. Matt. 24:24; Mark 13:22) or the Jewish people demanding evidence of Jesus' Messiahship (cf. Matt. 12:39; 16:1; John 4:48). God wants the world to know Him!, 342021=7:9 Verses 9-10 and 13-14 are set in poetic form (i.e. poetic lines) in NASB, NKJV, NRSV, NJB. This means that the verses must be interpreted in light of Semitic poetic parallelism., 237397=4:35 This chapter has several poetic hymnic affirmations (cf. vv. 3,34-35,37)., 231167=4:28 This summary verse is placed first, similar to vv. 1-3. This verse asserts a great biblical truth\u2014what God says comes to be (cf. Num. 23:19c; Isa. 40:8; 45:23; 55:11). When all is said and done humanity's only hope is in the unchanging merciful character of God (cf. Mal. 3:6). His promises are an extension of His character., 451113=9:2 \"observed in the books the number of years which was revealed as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet\" This refers to Jer. 25:9-13 or 29:10, although another prophecy is made in II Chr. 36:21, where the years of captivity are prophesied as seventy in number because of the Jews' failure to keep the sabbatical years mentioned in Lev. 26:33-35. This time sequence (70 years) is important because it will be picked up on by the angel in verse 24 to describe a new period of 70 units which the people of God must endure., 215996=4:13 \"the angelic watcher\" This means \"one that stays awake\" (BDB 1105, The Hebrew counterpart is used of God in Ps. 121:4). This Aramaic word and concept is used only in this chapter in the entire Bible. It is SINGULAR in v. 13 but PLURAL in verse 17. The Hebrew counterpart is used of angels in the inter-testamental books of Jubilees (4:15) and I Enoch (1:5) and for fallen angels (cf. I Enoch 10-16). It has been found in Cave 1 of the Qumran Text in \"the Genesis Apocraphon\" and is used for fallen angels. It is also known to be the title for the messenger of the gods in the Canaanite pantheon (Ras Shamra texts from Ugarit). We are uncertain if this is an allusion to Babylonian mythology or simply a unique way to refer to a special type of angel., 268376=5:19 \"'all the peoples, nations, and men of every language'\" This is a hyperbole used to show the extent of the neo-Babylonian empire under Nebuchadnezzar II (cf. 3:4,7; 4:1; 5:19; 6:25)., 728768=The terms \"Zion\" and \"Jerusalem\" are often synonyms in the OT (e.g. 1:17; 2:7,10; 8:2,3; 9:9)., 500947=For a good, brief discussion of the symbolic use of numbers see (1) Encyclopedia Judaica, vol. 12, pp. 1256-1259; (2) Biblical Numerology, A Basic Study of the Use of Numbers in the Bible, by John J. Davis; or (3) Biblical Hermeneutics, by Milton S. Terry, pp. 380-390., 719693=1:9 \"My lord\" This is not the covenant name for God, but simply the term adoni (BDB 10) for \"my owner,\" \"master,\" or \"lord\" (cf. 4:4,5,13). Zechariah is addressing his angel guide (cf. 1:19; 2:3; 4:1,4,5; 5:5,10; 6:4; also note a similar angel in Ezek. 8:2-3; 40:3-4; Dan. 7:16; 8:16-17; 9:22; 10:18-21). See SPECIAL TOPIC: NAMES FOR DEITY at dan. 4:2., 1042444=2.\u00a0nations, Jer. 4:20; 9:18; 48:15,20, 769469=\u25a3 \"will join themselves\" This (BDB 530 I, KB 522) is a Niphal form. This is the grammatical question, is the VERB meant to be PASSIVE (cf. NKJV, NJB) or REFLEXIVE ( NRSV, cf. Jer. 50:5)? This same theological issue is seen in Gen. 12:3 (cf. Isa. 56:3,6). See SPECIAL TOPIC: ELECTION/PREDESTINATION AND THE NEED FOR A THEOLOGICAL BALANCE Versus Human Free Will at 1:4, 338232=a.\u00a0literally in 4:33; 7:5,7,19, 122867=This kind of approach (BDB 1096, 1094) characterizes the way these four Hebrew youths dealt with Babylonian court intrigue and political pressure. God's wisdom enabled them to fit in, but also stand out!, 518289=This construct is literally \"the extremity of abomination\" (BDB 489 and 1055). The \"extremity\" (BDB 489) can refer to the wing of the temple or to the ultimacy of the abomination (BDB 1055, e.g. Antiochus having a pig sacrificed on the altar and an idol to Zeus set up in the Holy Place of the temple). In the OT, abominations referred to idol worship (e.g. I Kgs. 11:7; II Kgs. 23:13; II Chr. 15:8). Jesus used this phrase to speak of the coming of the Roman army and the destruction of Jerusalem (cf. Matt. 24:15; Mark 13:14; Luke 21:20, 21)., 398517=3.\u00a0John, on Patmos, taken to heaven, Rev. 4:2 (cf. 17:3; 21:10), 645104=3.\u00a0stand against, 8:25; 10:13; 11:14, 182413=3:24 Notice that Nebuchadnezzar, talking to his counselors, says, \"did not we cast?\" He wants to spread the blame., 120702=1.\u00a02:6, \"gifts and a reward\", 984888=9:14 \"Then the Lord will appear over them\" The VERB (BDB 906, KB 1157) is a Niphal IMPERFECT. This may be an allusion to the promise of protection in 2:5 (cf. 9:8a). It also may be an allusion to Isa. 31:5, where God is a protecting bird of prey (cf. Exod. 19:4b) or a mother bird hovering overhead (cf. Deut. 32:11; Ps. 91:4). The third possibility is borrowing the imagery of Assyria where their god fluttered over his troops in battle., 87653=1:12 \"some vegetables\" This term refers to things sown or grown from seeds (BDB 283). It is not certain if these types of food were part of the royal diet or special ordered items. These youths wanted to avoid the royal meat and wine possibly because (1) had been dedicated to pagan Persian gods and (2) also did not conform to Levitical regulations (Lev. 11; Deut. 14)., 39190=2.\u00a0the Aramaic section runs from 2:4b-7:28, which overlaps the traditional literary division of chapters 1-6 (historical) and 7-12 (eschatological), 662755=5.\u00a0Him who lives forever, 12:7, 126131=2:17 Notice that the Hebrew names for these young men are used here (i.e. among themselves), while in v. 49 the new Babylonian names are used at court., 74121=1:4 \"youths\" This word has a wide usage (BDB 409) from newborns (cf. Exod. 1:17,18; 3:6,7,8,9,10; II Sam. 12:5) to young men able to be trained for court service (cf. Dan. 1:4,10,15,17). Therefore, the age of these four youths cannot be determined by the word, but only by context., 552805=1.\u00a0the Messiah, 7:13, 299446=6:14 The King realizes that he has been used in a scheme to destroy Daniel (cf. v. 24), but is powerless (cf. vv. 16,18,19) in the legal circumstances to forestall his own royal edict (cf. vv. 12,15)., 143183=This verse reminds me of God's care for animals (cf. Jonah 4:11; Ps. 36:6c). Animals may be a part of the new creation (cf. Isa. 11:6-9; 65:25 and possibly Rom. 8:18-22)., 429175=8:20 \"the ram. . .Medo-Persia\" The ram was the sign of Persia (Aries, the Zodiac sign), but the ram was also the guardian spirit of Persia and the king wore the ram's emblem to battle., 542105=10:12 \"Do not be afraid\" This is apparently a Qal JUSSIVE in meaning but not form, as is v. 19. This is YHWH's recurrent message (sometimes through angels) to His people (e.g. Gen. 15:1; 21:17; 26:24; 35:17; 43:23; Deut. 3:22; 7:18; 20:1; 31:6,8; Isa. 7:4; 35:4; 40:9; 41:10,13,14; 43:5; 44:2; 54:4; Jer. 30:10; 46:27-28). God is for us and with us (cf. Josh. 1:5-7; Isa. 43:2,5)., 392636=C.\u00a0As in his first vision Daniel was compelled to focus on the fourth kingdom; two years later (compare 7:1 with 8:1) God revealed information about the second and third kingdoms in another vision., 834500=5:1 \"Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked\" This is the regular literary introduction for a new vision. See full note at 1:8. This chapter contains two visions (cf. v. 5)., 1055096=The very concept of YHWH breaking His eternal covenant (cf. Isa. 24:5) with the descendants of Abraham was shocking, but notice Jer. 14:21 and Ezek. 16:59., 290741=6:3 \"this Daniel began to distinguish himself\" This phrase begins with the DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUN \"this\" (cf. vv. 5,28), which is typical of Persian style, but also is a way to accentuate Daniel's giftedness (cf. 1:17,20; 2:21,23). He was probably between eighty and ninety years of age at this point., 528506=\u25a3 \"the message was true\" The term \"message\" in NASB is literally \"word\" (BDB 182, cf. 9:2,12,23,25; 10:1,6,9,11,12,15). It is translated as \"matter,\" \"word,\" \"message,\" or \"revelation.\" This word is used five times in chapter 9 and eleven times in chapter 10. It is the term used in 12:4,9 as to what Daniel is to \"seal up.\", 924866=8:9 \"let your hands be strong\" This is a Qal IMPERFECT (BDB 304, KB 302) used in a JUSSIVE sense. Notice that this idiomatic phrase begins and concludes (cf. v. 13) this paragraph. This phrase shows the human side of the covenant relationship., 294541=\u25a3 \"the lions' den\" See note at 6:17., 938137=8:23, 922718=This term is used in chapter 8 several times (cf. vv. 3,8,16[twice],19) in the sense of \"truth.\" In 7:9 and 8:16 it refers to a true or faithful testimony in court. Verses 16 and 19 are parallel and speak of the truthful and trustworthy relationship between covenant partners in society. Truth has a corporate societal focus. Truth is relational as well as propositional!, 876131=6:14, 645025=2.\u00a0come on the scene, 8:22,23; 11:7; 12:1, 149965=2:47 These very high-sounding words (cf. 3:28-29; 4:1-3,34-37) do not mean that Nebuchadnezzar II became a believer in YHWH. He was a polytheist who had no problem with adding other gods to his pantheon. He was still a worshiper of Marduk and Nebo. It is astonishing that he would allow YHWH, the national deity of the Hebrews to be characterized as the revealer of mysteries, for this was the function of Nebo in the Babylonian pantheon., 418676=8:14 \"for 2,300 hundred evenings and mornings\" This phrase has been interpreted in two ways: (1) 2300 full days (E. J. Young, pp. 173-175) or (2) a number equivalent to three and a half years that seems to follow the usage in Gen. 1 (\"evenings and mornings\") and the phrase related to persecution in Dan. 7:25. Context favors #2 because of the use of a similar period of time in Daniel and Revelation. See note at 7:25., 816811=\u25a3 \"the top stone\" This refers to rebuilding of the temple, but also may relate to 3:8-9, which links it somehow to the Messiah or the stone of Dan. 2:44-45 (i.e. the eternal Messianic kingdom). See SPECIAL TOPIC: CORNERSTONE at Dan. 2:34, esp. I. D)., 72293=This title reflects an Akkadian phrase, \"he who is of the king's head,\" therefore, it contains no implication of castration. In Isa. 56:3; Jer. 38:7, and Esther 2:3 the Hebrew term (BDB 710) reflects castration. In Gen. 37:36; 39:1 it is used of Potiphar, who was married (cf. Gen. 39:7). The term came to be used generally of court officials. Some were castrated, especially those who worked with the harem, but not all. Josephus says the youths were tortured (i.e. castrated, cf. Antiq. 10.10.1)., 914825=The Hebrew root (BDB 404) means \"to be hot.\" The implication here is YHWH's passion (the Piel form means \"to conceive\"). This term is often used by the seventh century prophets (i.e. Jeremiah and Ezekiel, note specifically Ezek. 36:6-7). The interpretive question is how to understand \"wrath.\" (1) Is it meant to refer to God's hot passion for His people or (2) His anger at those He chose to discipline her? I believe the Hebrew phrase, \"I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, with great wrath, I am jealous\" best fits option #2 (cf. NIV, REB). This is not the same Hebrew word as 7:12 (BDB 893)., 841181=5:6 \"What is it\" Again the prophet asked for an angelic interpretation of the vision, as he did in all but one of the six visions., 338300=b.\u00a0metaphorically of slander in 3:8; 6:25, 747793=3.\u00a0angels in the vision (e.g. 1:10,11,13; 2:2,4), 654679=It is possible that this verse denotes degrees of rewards. See Special Topic: Degrees of Rewards and Punishment at Dan. 7:10., 271309=5:25 \"MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN\" These NOUNS were apparently the names for ancient weights and measures. Daniel turns them into VERBS to interpret their meaning. The term MENE (BDB 1101) is a word which means \"to number.\" Literally, it is a particular weight called a \"mina,\" (cf. I Kings 10: 17; Ezra 2:69; Neh. 7:71, 72)., 1042519=3.\u00a0houses, Jer. 4:20; 10:20, 180313=3:21 \"their trousers, their coats, their caps, and their other clothes\" This was their official attire showing the high governmental level they had attained in the neo-Babylonian empire., 987115=1.\u00a0military purposes, Josh. 6:4,5,20; Jdgs. 7:8,16, 1113850=13:8 \"That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it\" This seems to refer to some type of punishment by God where two-thirds of the people perish. This is either a reference to a military invasion or to the spiritual rejection of the Messiah by two-thirds of God's people. Again, the time setting is ambiguous., 751675=\u25a3 \"I will be the glory in her midst\" God's presence with His people is referred to here (cf. v. 11; Exod. 25:8; 40:34; Ezek. 43:1-5). This is the ultimate hope of the restoration of initiate fellowship with God (cf. Rev. 21:3,23). It also shows that the Covenant is restored and fulfilled! Immanuel is with His people (cf. Isa. 7:14; 8:8,10)., 145113=2:41 \"it will be a divided kingdom\" This refers to the fourth kingdom and seems to imply that these will be successive kingdoms. There has been much discussion about the meaning of it being divided (BDB 1108, Peal PASSIVE PARTICIPLE): (1) the Roman Empire would divide into the east and west; (2) it refers to the attempted political marriages with Germanic tribes (cf. v. 43 and TEV); or (3) it possibly refers to the distinction between the republic and later the dictatorship., 713394=4.\u00a0\"the Lord showed me,\" 1:20, 1013879=God is transforming and equipping His people so as to change them from sheep (or devious \"he goats\") into majestic war stallions (cf. 9:13). This is an example of the drastic contrasts in prophetic literature (e.g. no war in 9:10 vs. war in 9:13; 10:3)., 296996=6:10 \"Now when Daniel knew the document was signed\" Daniel was not taken off guard, but he was more loyal to his lifestyle faith (cf. vv. 15,20) than to the comings and goings of these jealous political leaders and their schemes., 598320=11:10 \"and his sons\" This refers to the sons of Antiochus II (the king of the North): (1) Seleucus II Callinicus (240-227 b.c.) and (2) Antiochus III (223-187 b.c.), later known as \"the Great.\" The phrase in verse 10, \"one of them,\" refers to Antiochus III., 604319=11:17 \"he will also give the daughter of women to ruin it\" Here is another attempt at political marriage, but this time it is an attempt to overthrow Egypt, not reconcile with the Ptolemies. \"The daughter\" refers to Cleopatra I, the daughter of Antiochus III. She was married in 195 b.c. to Ptolemy V. Because of his young age, the marriage was not consummated for five years. Cleopatra's father was hoping to control Egypt through his daughter, but she truly loved the young Egyptian monarch and sided with him., 738298=\u25a3 \"to scatter\" The terms \"scatter\" (BDB 279, KB 280, Piel PERFECT of 1:19, 21[twice]) and \"gather\" were often used in the Ancient Near East as metaphors for the well being of nations based on the activity of their gods. In the Bible it is YHWH who allowed His people to be scattered, but He will protect them and gather them again., 118422=2:11 \"difficult\" This Hebrew term (BDB 1096) normally means \"precious,\" \"costly,\" \"valued.\" It can mean \"rare\" (cf. KJV and marginal note in NASB)., 204246=4:4, 338602=b.\u00a0also literally of the lions crushing those who attacked Daniel in 6:24, 669081=12:12 \"How blessed is he who keeps waiting and attains to the 1,335 days\" This seems to be longer than most of the prophetic dates (cf. v. 7). Those who remain faithful to God even in the midst of an extended persecution will be rewarded and blessed. Perseverance is crucial., 262757=\u25a3 \"a spirit of the holy gods\" See note at 4:8., 208519=This Aramaic phrase is similar to the Hebrew phrase used of Joseph in Gen. 41:38. Both Joseph and Daniel served pagan kings and interpreted their dreams., 758995=Here it is used to designate (1) the place to which the Jewish people who had not returned from exile must escape to (cf. LXX) or (2) the majority of Jewish people themselves (cf. Isa. 51:16; 52:1,2,7,8) who had not returned to Palestine., 431655=8:24 \"\u2018his power will be mighty, but not by his own power'\" Here again, is the recurrent theme of God's control and direction of human history (cf. v. 25f; 2:20-23). God used Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome, and will use whomever He chooses to accomplish His will (cf. Rom. 9)! Often humans, even redeemed humans, do not understand (cf. Isa. 55:8-11)., 791504=\u25a3 \"clean turban\" This term (BDB 857) is a cognate of the Hebrew term used in Exodus. It refers to the miter of the High Priest (cf. Exod. 28:36-39; 39:28,31)., 875966=4.\u00a0Priest of Median, Exod. 3:1, 537087=\u25a3 \"his eyes were like flaming torches\" This is used of the Exalted Christ in Rev. 1:14; 2:18; 19:12, where it refers to His knowledge and insight., 692037=God's word is sure and permanent (cf. Isa. 45:23, 55:11; Matt. 5:17-20). How each generation responds to Him (personal) and it (doctrinal and lifestyle) determines their blessing or cursing (cf. Deut. 27-29)., 548831=6.\u00a0Jer. 48:47; 49:39 - God restoring the nations to peace and prosperity, 289871=The term \"three\" may be related contextually to 5:7,16,29. At this point these three chief overseers are unknown to secular history., 556476=\u25a3 \"Peace be with you\" This is the only occurrence of this NOUN (or VERB) in Daniel. It means (BDB 1022) \"completeness,\" \"soundness,\" \"welfare,\" \"peace.\" It is used often in Isaiah and Jeremiah. This same concept is expressed by Jesus (only in John) to His disciples (cf. 14:27; 16:33; 20:19,21,26)., 899601=7:10 \"do not oppress the widow. . .the orphan. . .the stranger. . .the poor\" The NEGATED VERB (BDB 798, KB 897) is a Qal IMPERFECT used in a JUSSIVE sense. Justice without partiality is a recurrent theme of the book of Deuteronomy (cf. 1:17; 10:17; 16:19; 24:14,17). God defends the defenseless., 646384=This seems to refer to the Messianic woes referred to by Jesus in Matt. 24:21, 22 (cf. Mark 13:19-20). The Septuagint has \"nations written in the book.\" In Matt. 24:21 Jesus changes the word \"nations\" to \"world,\" which is the NT universal understanding of the extension of covenant love to all humans through the gospel., 301760=6:18 \"the king went off to his palace and spent the night fasting\" This was not necessarily religious fasting, but simply the anxious worrying of a man who knew he had been tricked into doing evil to an innocent (cf. v. 22) faithful (and a very effective) servant., 1076489=12:3 \"all who lift it will be severely injured\" This seems to be used of a stone which the nations attempted to lift off of its foundation, but all were herniated by the attempt., 236761=\u25a3 \"the Most High\" See Special Topic at 4:2., 485917=\u25a3 \"have been decreed\" This Hebrew term \"decree\" (BDB 367, KB 364) is found only here in the OT (there are three Aramaic terms translated \"decree\" in 2:4-7:28, but none relate to this Hebrew form). It is related to an Aramaic term which meant \"to cut,\" \"cut off,\" or \"decide.\" This is a Niphal PASSIVE form., 118088=2:10 \"Chaldeans answered\" There is a series of three alibis: (1) no man on earth can do this; (2) no king has ever asked this of the wise men before; and (3) only the gods can answer this question (cf. v. 11). This heightens the significance of Daniel's interpretation., 820192=4:10 \"For who has despised. . .small things\" Some speculate that Zechariah (or other current leaders) was taken into captivity as a young man and was now very old. He remembered Solomon's glorious temple, and this second temple was quite modest compared to it. The differences were somewhat discouraging to the people (cf. Ezra 3:12; Hag. 2:3)., 631798=However, the word often simply means \"destroy,\" which it probably means here (cf. Isa. 37:11; Jer. 50:21,26; 51:3)., 422329=8:17 \"\u2018I was frightened and fell on my face'\" Humans are shocked at the presence and awesomeness of the spiritual realm., 796733=3:8 \"you and your friends who are sitting in front of you\" This refers to the other priests and Levites., 984220=\u25a3 \"'O Zion, against your son, O Greece'\" The term here for Greece is Jawan or Javan, which was used originally in the OT for a descendant of Japheth (cf. Gen. 10:2,4; Isa. 66:19), while in Isa. 66:19 it is used for a nation. In the books of Daniel and Joel, it is used to designate Greece (cf. Dan. 8:21; 10:20; Joel 3:6). I agree with Joyce Baldwin, Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries, that it is used in its Gen. 10 sense of a distant people on the fringe of civilization, which is how it is used in this eschatological context (cf. p. 169)., 615959=\u25a3 \"he will return and come into the South\" This refers to a second campaign by Antiochus IV against Ptolemy VI, which is recorded in I Maccabees 1:29 and Polybius 29:1., 1060957=11:15, 264918=5:13 \"'Are you that Daniel who is one of the exiles from Judah'\" Notice that the king addresses him by his Hebrew name, not his Babylonian name. Also notice that it is mentioned that he is from Judah, the location of the very God that Belshazzar had offended (cf. verse 22)., 885219=C.\u00a0The promised covenant renewal still requires obedience (cf. 6:15 and 8:16-17). The covenant requirements of the Old Covenant and the New Covenant are the same., 369410=7:21 \"and the horn was waging war with the saints and overpowering them\" This shows the historical setting of the time of the little horn of the fourth empire will be the severe persecution of God's people. God allows this to happen for His ultimate purposes (cf. Rev. 13:7)., 674494=C.\u00a0Zechariah 1:1 tells us that he was a priest (cf. Ezra 5:1; 6:14; Neh. 12:4,16). Why his ancestor, Berechiah, is omitted from the list is uncertain. This would make him a post-exilic prophet, like Haggai, Malachi, and possibly Obadiah and Joel., 1053220=11:9 \"I will not pasture you\" Most English translations see the \"you\" as referring to the sheep. However, the UBS, Handbook, points out that the PRONOUN is MASCULINE, not FEMININE (pp. 292-293). It can mean \"pasture for you,\" which would make it refer to the \"sheep merchants\" of vv. 7,11., 534636=1.\u00a0Adam, 8:16; 10:16,18, 856529=2.\u00a06:1, bronze mountains of opposition against YHWH's judgment on the nations, 1059311=11:14 \"my second staff, Union, in pieces, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel\" In chapters nine and ten there is an emphasis on the restoration of the people of God, but here, old scars are reopened and the union disappears! The footnote in the JB suggests this might refer to the Samaritan schism in 328 b.c. in which they built a rival temple on Mt. Gerizin (p. 1541)., 730795=The VERB (BDB 996, KB 1427) is a Qal PERFECT. The time element must be discerned from the context. Be careful of personal bias or systematic theology setting a particular time frame (only context can denote the original author's intent). The Jewish Publication Society of America's translation supposes a current return. This is a play on the Hebrew word shub, used in 1:3,4,6. As they returned to God, He would return to them. This is also significant because in Ezek. 10:18,19; 11:23, God's presence left Jerusalem (the temple) and went east to be with the exiles. God assures the returning Jews that His glory will return to a rebuilt temple and that the covenant would be reestablished (i.e. 516 b.c.)., 722122=The TEV interprets \"peaceful\"(BDB 442, KB 444, QAL ACTIVE PARTICIPLE) and \"quiet\" (BDB 1053, KB 1641, QAL ACTIVE PARTICIPLE) as \"helpless and subdued.\" It is translating the Hebrew words in a unique way based on context. The interpretive question is what does the patrolling angel's answer mean: (1) all is quiet and well or (2) all is not well, but quiet? Is the Persian Empire a liberating force or an occupying force? It seems to me that it is a liberating force, so different from Assyria and Babylon. It had allowed the Jews to return home and even offered materials to rebuild their temple. In time it would allow the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem even amidst the objections of the surrounding nations (cf. Nehemiah)., 993002=9:17 As the previous verses may be an allusion to Jer. 31:10-11, so too, this may refer to the return from exile, but extends it to the eschatological future and the time of the \"new covenant\" (cf. Jer. 31:31-34)., 80878=It is also possible that another origin is Belet-sar-usur, meaning \"lady (wife of Marduk or Bel) protect the king\" (cf. A. R. Millard, \"Daniel 1-6 and History,\" EQ, XLIX, 2, 1977 mentioned in Tyndale Commentary, p. 81 footnote #1)., 358391=\u25a3 \"was presented before Him\" As the Messiah (\"one like a son of man\") is presented (BDB 1111, Haphel PERFECT) before the covenant-making YHWH, so Jesus introduces believers into the presence of God the Father (cf. Col. 1:22,28; II Cor. 4:14). Remember the Messiah receives the eternal kingdom, but in the same context it is the \"saints\" (holy ones) who receive the eternal kingdom (cf. vv. 13-14 versus vv. 18,22,27)., 713028=1.\u00a0\"I saw,\" 1:8, 39598=2.\u00a0the ram (second kingdom) of chapter 8 as Medo-Persia, 8:20, 860814=6:6 \"north\" This term refers to the invaders of Palestine from Mesopotamia. Because of the desert these empires followed the Euphrates River to the coastal plain and then went south. Therefore, \"the north\" became an idiom of peril, invasion, death, exile., 875908=3.\u00a0Reuel, Exod. 2:18, 1135780=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:14:9 \u00a09And the Lord will be king over all the earth; in that day the Lord will be the only one, and His name the only one., 549959=\u25a3 \"for the vision pertains to the days yet future\" A similar phrase is used in 8:26 to refer to Antiochus IV's reign, while in 2:28; 12:4,9 similar words seem to refer to the end of time. The future is often determined by the understanding or historical perspective of the human writer! The really hard interpretive issue in Daniel's visions is to what future time period they refer. Most of Daniel's visions relate to the second (Medo-Persian) and third (Greece) kingdoms. However, certain texts could relate to the end-time antichrist (cf. 7:7-8,11,23-28; 9:24-27; 11:36-45). These very passages could refer to Jesus' first coming or Jesus' second coming, which are telescoped together in the OT. Modern interpreters must not push the ambiguous details of this genre into a systematic eschatology which dominates NT prophecies. Neither Jesus nor other NT writers reaffirm OT nationalistic exclusivistic prophecies relating to Israel. We dare not allow the OT to interpret the NT (cf. Matt. 5:17-19; Gal. 3; Hebrews). The Messiah comes for all (cf. Gen. 3:15), not just Israel. Israel is the parenthesis and is not the focus of the New Covenant (cf. Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 36:22-38)., 604952=11:18 \"Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many\" This refers to Antiochus III's attempted domination of the coastlands and the islands of the eastern Mediterranean. This attempt was stopped in 190 b.c. by a united force from the Greek city states and the Roman army (General Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus). The truce was signed at the city of Magnesia, west of Sardis. The Roman victors put extremely hard surrender terms on Antiochus III., 552147=10:16, 890925=7:3 \"speaking to the priests. . .the prophets\" The priests would refer to those who had returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel and Joshua or Ezra. It is uncertain to whom \"the prophets\" refers. Haggai and Zechariah are the only ones known by name. I think both Joel and Obadiah were also early post-exilic prophets. Whomever they were these emissaries came to the representatives of the God asking about the continuance of a fast denoting the destruction of Jerusalem, now that the Jews had returned to Jerusalem., 212986=\u25a3 \"its height reached to the sky\" This phrase is reminiscent of the Tower of Babel in Gen. 11:4, which also denotes human arrogance and pride (cf. Isa. 14:14)., 128718=2:19 \"a night vision\" There is a distinction between a \"vision\" and \"dream\" (cf. 1:17) in the OT, but not in Daniel. This revelation was at night (cf. 7:2,7,13), but Daniel was conscious and the revelation was visual and auditory. In context Nebuchadnezzar had the dream, but Daniel received the vision needed to interpret it. Both were from God., 603031=11:16 \"he. . .will do as he pleases\" See theological note at 8:4., 414637=\u25a3 \"it will fling truth to the ground\" The same VERB (BDB 1020, KB 1527, Hiphil IMPERFECT) appears in v. 11 and in Ezek. 19:12, but the concept is expressed in Isa. 59:14. In general it refers to the worship of God or the word of God., 772584=\u25a3 \"and will again choose Jerusalem\" This (VERB, BDB 103, Qal PERFECT) is the emphasis in Deuteronomy on Jerusalem as the place of God's unique presence above the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies of the Temple (cf. Deut. 12:5,11). See note on \"choose\" at 1:17., 475042=9:18 \"not. . .on account of any merits of our own, but on account of Thy great compassion\" Daniel is praying much like Moses, in that he appeals to God's character (cf. vv. 17,19) for forgiveness and unmerited deliverance to Jerusalem, the temple, and the people as a whole (cf. v. 19), not any deserved or attained righteousness on Israel's part. This is the OT incipient concept of justification by grace through faith (cf. Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3; Gal. 3:6)., 51117=The tension arises when God chooses to use one man, one family, one nation to reach the rest of mankind. God's election of Abraham and the Jews as a kingdom of priests (cf. Exod. 19:4-6) caused pride instead of service, exclusion instead of inclusion. God's call of Abraham involved the intentional blessing of all mankind (cf. Gen. 12:3). It must be remembered and emphasized that OT election was for service, not salvation. All Israel was never right with God, never eternally saved based solely on her birthright (cf. John 8:31-59; Matt. 3:9), but by personal faith and obedience (cf. Gen. 15:6, quoted in Rom. 4). Israel lost her mission, turned mandate into privilege, service into a special standing! God chose one to choose all!\", 111114=Here and in v. 10 it occurs last in a list of wise men, but in 4:7; 5:7,11 it occurs within the list. It is obvious this term had several connotations (BDB 505). It seems to be a collective term for wise men (cf. v. 4)., 925554=8:10 This is a summary of what life in Palestine was like (\"before those days\") between the fall of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar (586 b.c.) and the return (\"but now\" of v. 11) to Jerusalem decreed by Cyrus (538 b.c.)., 179402=3:19 \"seven times more than it was usually heated\" This is an obvious use of figurative language (cf. v. 22). It simply means that the brick kiln was heated as hot as it possibly could be heated., 893940=7:7 \"the former prophets\" See note at 1:4., 1126936=\u25a3 \"the city will be captured\" The VERB (BDB 539, KB 530) is a Niphil PERFECT. This final, ultimate confrontation between the kingdoms of this world and the kingdom of our God will result in the partial fall of Jerusalem (cf. 13:8). This fall is described in vivid terms from Jerusalem's past experience with conquering invaders. However, a remnant will remain (in 13:8 only 1/3, but here 1/2). This is a stark contrast to the divine protection promised in 12:1-9., 332089=7:5 \"a bear\" This is another powerful predator of the Near East, which is used often in the OT paralleled with lion (cf. I Sam. 17:34,36,37; Prov. 28:15; Amos 5:19; Rev. 13:2). Several Scriptures describe the fierceness of a bear with cubs (cf. II Sam. 17:8; Prov. 17:12; Hos. 13:8)., 816431=4:7 \"What\" This Hebrew PRONOUN (BDB 566) may be \"who.\" The mountain is a metaphor for obstacles: physical, personal, and spiritual (e.g. Isa. 40:4; 41:15; 45:11) and refers to the rebuilding of the second temple. However, it may refer to the Samaritan opposition (cf. Ezra 4) or to Jewish apathy (Haggai)., 399201=8:3 \"a ram which had two horns\" This seems to refer to Medo-Persia (cf. 8:20) and is analogous to the bear with one side lifted of Daniel 7 and the breast and arms of silver in chapter 2., 1049408=11:7 \"I\" The \"I\" of v. 6 (as v. 16) referred to YHWH, so too, vv. 7-11, 12-14. It is possible that Zechariah speaks and acts for YHWH or that the Messiah speaks and acts for YHWH. The NIV footnote says, \"Zechariah, as a type (foreshadowing) of the Messianic Shepherd-King\" (p. 1418). This is the fluidity in apocalyptic prophecy, which makes it so difficult to be specific., 600591=11:13 \"after an interval of some years\" This seems to refer to a thirteen year historical gap. Antiochus III attacked Egypt again in 205 b.c.)., 642486=\u25a3 \"Michael\" His name means \"who is like God\" (BDB 567). There are only two angels mentioned by name in the Bible: Gabriel, apparently a messenger angel, and Michael, apparently the guardian angel of the nation of Israel or the people of God. This angel is mentioned in Dan. 10:13, 21 and in the book of Jude, v. 9, where he is called the archangel. John Calvin thought that Michael was the pre-existent Christ., 990577=9:16 \"the Lord their God will save them in that day\" This is parallel to the opening lines of vv. 14 and 15. As v. 14 had Adon YHWH, this verse has YHWH Elohim., 1014746=\u25a3 \"the cornerstone\" This refers to the Messiah in Ps. 118:22 and Isa. 28:16. See Special Topic at Dan. 2:34., 1055459=11:11 \"So it was broken on that day\" The real interpretive question is does this refer to (1) the past acts of YHWH; (2) the future acts of the Messiah; or (3) a typology of God's leaders?, 148198=This same powerful imagery describes this kingdom in 7:14,27., 711378=1:7 \"On the twenty-fourth day\" It is uncertain why the twenty-fourth day was so significant, but it is referred to extensively by the prophet Haggai (cf. 1:15; 2:10,18,20). This exact date seems to be Feb. 15, 519 b.c., 132642=2:25 \"Arioch. . .I have found\" As all politicians, Arioch claimed credit for finding Daniel when, in reality, Daniel approached him (cf. 24)., 199826=\u25a3 \"\u2018May your peace abound'\" This is parallel to 6:25 (cf. Ezra 4:17). This was a common idiom for initial greetings, meaning \"welfare,\" \"prosperity\" (BDB 1116). Nebuchadnezzar is declaring, in a royal decree, the praises of the God of Judah, who he calls \"the Most High God.\" See Special Topic at 4:2., 812085=4:4 This fifth vision returns to the pattern of one through four, where the prophet asked the interpreting angel for an interpretation of the vision (cf. 1:9,19; 2:2; 5:6,10; 6:4)., 644101=\u25a3 \"who stands guard over the sons of your people\" Many believe that this refers only to the Jews because of the context of chapter 11. However, the quote in Matt. 24:21, 22 seems to imply that Jesus was referring to \"the elect.\" From Rom. 2:28,29; 4:16; Gal. 6:16 we know that this promise refers to all who have the faith of Abraham., 1099394=\u25a3 \"a fountain will be opened\" The concept of a fountain of life comes from Isa. 12:2-3; Jer. 2:13 (for the negative see Jer. 51:36; Hos. 13:15); and 17:13. God is the source of life (cf. Ps. 36:5-9). In this context it refers to the forgiveness of sin, which is obviously related to the repentance mentioned in 12:10. This is a picture of the new covenant of Jer. 31:34; Ezek. 36:25 (cf. Rom. 11:26-27; Eph. 5:26; Titus 3:5)., 651212=\u25a3 \"will awake\" This VERB (BDB 884, KB 1098) is a Hiphael IMPERFECT. This is another Hebrew idiom of life from death (cf. II Kgs. 4:31; Jer. 51:39,57; Job 14:12). In Isa. 26:19 and here it denotes resurrection. This is exactly the implication of Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones (cf. Ezek. 37), but in an individual sense. Some will awake to everlasting joy (cf. Isa. 66:22-23) and others to everlasting contempt (cf. Isa. 66:24). For a good discussion see Millard J. Erickson, Christian Theology, 2 ed., pp. 1200-1210 or Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels, IVP, pp. 673-688 or The Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible, vol. 5, pp. 70-75., 452950=9:3, 1113416=\u25a3 \"I will turn My hand against the little ones\" The VERB (BDB 996 [top of, p. 999], KB 1427, Hiphil PERFECT) is used especially of God's judgment (cf. Isa. 1:25; Zech. 13:7; Ps. 81:15). The phrase \"the little ones\" is parallel to \"the sheep,\" which are scattered in the previous verse. This must be a time of testing initiated by God Himself., 226199=4:22 \"it is you, O king\" The king himself as the representative of his empire is the focus of the dream, as in chapter 2 (v. 38b, \"you are the head of gold\")., 705384=1:4 \"the former prophets\" This phrase becomes a technical term in later rabbinical writings for the \"historical books\" of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings. Here it refers to the pre-exilic writing prophets of the eighth and seventh centuries (cf. 7:7; II Chr. 24:19; 36:15)., 466206=9:9 \"to the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness\" The term \"compassion\" (BDB 933) may be a metaphor from the word \"womb,\" thereby speaking of family love. God often describes His ways with humanity by means of familial images (father, kinsman redeemer, parents, family, etc.)., 269124=5:21 \"the Most High God\" See Special Topic at 4:2., 926823=8:13 This is a very important verse because it shows the intended purpose of Israel. God called Abraham to call a world (cf. Gen. 12:3; Exod. 19:5-6). God's special relationship and blessing to the descendants of Abraham was meant to attract the notice of the rest of the sons of Adam. The nationalism of Genesis 10-11 is reflected in v. 10c. However, the Jewish people were not faithful to the covenant. Their lives did not reflect the holiness of YHWH, but the fallenness of Genesis 3. Those who were meant to be a light became a deterrent (cf. Ezek. 36:18-23). God had to first change His own people's hearts and minds. They could not perform God's covenant requirements. Therefore, a new covenant was required; one based on God's character and provision (cf. Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 36:24-38). With this new covenant God's people can become their intended \"blessing\" to a lost world. The \"curse\" of Deuteronomy 27-29 has been removed through Messiah. The tragedy is that Israel did not recognize this new opportunity to fulfill her world-wide missionary mandate. She turned inward into exclusivism and pride instead of outward. God's heart for \"the nations\" was not her heart. Monotheism and the unity of mankind (cf. Gen. 1:26-27) demands a universal people! Israel was a means to that end, not that end! The new age of righteousness depicted in Isaiah 55-66 was not fulfilled in the post-exilic return, but it will be in the Messianic Kingdom., 1088281=Other prophetic texts where \"the Spirit\" is poured out are Isa. 44:3; Ezek. 39:29 and also the classic text of Zech. 4:5. It is God who energizes and motivates the fallen human spirit to appropriate and righteous attitudes and actions., 1129044=14:5, 557873=10:20 \"the prince of Persia\" In 8:20 it combines the racial entities of Media and Persia into the third empire of Daniel's visions (i.e. chapters 2, 7, and 8). Here it just mentions the dominant one of the two. If this literally refers to national angels, how could there be just one angel? The same is true for Greece, which will divide into several regional empires after the death of Alexander the Great., 496795=9:25 \"from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem\" If this is to be understood historically then it relates to, 588853=11:3, 893736=7:6 \"when you eat and drink\" This is sarcasm. They were fasting and/or feasting for themselves, not for God (cf. Isa. 29:13; Col. 2:20-33)., 906430=This unusual phrase is found only in Zech. 7:14 and 9:8. Zechariah is using ?? divided into two literary units (chapters 1-8 and 9-14). This unusual phrase appears in both units and thereby becomes evidence for the unity of the book by one author., 904469=7:13 \"God called\" God called to them through the covenants, the Exodus, the temple, and the prophets (cf. Hos. 11:2), but they would not obey!, 175406=3:13 \"in rage and anger\" Nebuchadnezzar was prone to anger (cf. 2:12; 3:19). Oriental kings were not accustomed to people disobeying their orders!, 1029745=10:12 \"in His name\" Verse 1 of chapter 10 begins by saying they were to pray for rain from God, as they had previously been praying to idols. Verse 12 concludes this thought by asserting that they would walk in God's name and not in the idol's name (cf. Micah 4:5)., 869513=6:11 \"crown\" This is PLURAL (used with a SINGULAR VERB in v. 14), but it seems to refer to one crown, possibly a double crown (like those from Egypt) symbolizing \"the two offices\" (cf. v. 13). The Hebrew term (BDB 742) does not refer to a priestly crown (BDB 63, cf. Exod 29:6; Lev. 8:9), but to a royal one (cf. 9:16; I Chr. 20:2; Isa. 28:5; 2:3; Jer. 13:18; Ezek. 21:26)., 678715=2. Eight visions, 1:7-6:8, 173480=3:9 \"O king, live forever\" See note at 2:4., 1083967=12:8 \"the Lord will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem\" This means \"cover as with a shield\" (BDB 170, KB 199, Hiphil IMPERFECT, cf. 4:14-15; 9:15)., 1023133=\u25a3 \"I have redeemed them\" This Hebrew term (BDB 804, KB 911 Qal PERFECT) means to buy back or ransom. Here it is used of God's activity of restoring His people to the Promised Land (cf. Jer. 31:11). Jeremiah 31:10-13 may be the background to Zech. 9:17. Zechariah uses many phrases and terminologies from Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Minor Prophets before his day., 450852=\u25a3 \"who was made king\" This is similar to 5:31. Was he made king by God or by human authority? Obviously by both (cf. Isa. 44:28-45:7). Remember Dan. 2:20-23!, 228318=The parallelism of \"sins\" and \"iniquities\" is obvious, but also \"righteousness\" and \"mercy to the poor\" are parallel. This reflects the Jewish understanding of almsgiving (in the LXX translation as well as usage in the Targums and Talmud, cf. Ps. 112:3,9; Isa. 33:15; Matt. 6:1; II Cor. 9:6-11) as an expression of \"righteousness\" (i.e. God's character, cf. Isa. 58:6-11)., 232789=4:31 \"a voice came from heaven\" The rabbis assumed that this is the Bath-kol of the inter-biblical period, God's way of confirming His will during that time when there were no prophets in Israel. But, in context, it seems to refer to the decree of the angelic watchers (cf. vv. 12,23)., 534775=3.\u00a0Gebar, 3:25; 8:15, 873870=The term \"house\" (BDB 108) is used often (cf. 1:16; 3:7; 4:9; 8:9) to refer to the temple (BDB 228). However, in 8:9 both terms are used synonymously, so there is no intended distinction., 789203=3:4 \"to those who were standing before him\" Who does the \"him\" refer to (1) the angel of the LORD or (2) the LORD? Notice there are more angelic beings present than just the angel of the Lord and Satan. This is the throne-room of heaven. There are many angelic attendants (cf. v. 5)., 257011=5:5 \"the lampstand\" Bible readers are familiar with the lampstands of both the tabernacle (seven branched, cf. Exod. 25:31-40) and Solomon's temple (ten branched, cf. II Chr. 4:19-22). It is uncertain if this lamp from YHWH's temple (cf. Jer. 52:19) was brought to the party room along with the bowls or if this refers to one of the lamps, which normally lit the room. If it is YHWH's lampstand then the supernatural hand of revelation from heaven wrote its riddle right above this special holy item. Whichever is true the writing was placed in a conspicuous place where it was easily seen!, 668985=\u25a3 \"1290 days\" See note at v. 7., 596378=11:7 In verse 7 we see that Bernice's brother (\"branch of her roots\"), Ptolemy III (\"one of the descendants of her line\"), angry over the death of his sister, invaded the north (246 b.c.). He was very successful militarily against the Seleucid Empire, but did not push his advantage. He took a large amount of the spoils from Antioch and returned to Egypt. We learn of this in verses 8 and 9., 305443=\u25a3 \"shut the mouth of the lions\" This is both literal (cf. Heb. 11:33 and I Maccabees 2:59-60), but also metaphorical (cf. Ps. 22:21; II Tim. 4:17)., 1134062=\u25a3 \"at evening time there will be light\" God's presence provides continual light (cf. Isa. 60:19,20; Rev. 21:25; 22:5), as it did before the creation of the sun, stars, and moon (cf. Gen. 1:3-5 versus 1:14-19)., 548714=5.\u00a0Ezek. 38:16 - another attack on Israel after the return to the Promised Land, 1051419=11:8 \"I annihilated the three shepherds in one month\" The term \"annihilate\" (BDB 470, KB 469, Hiphil IMPERFECT) means \"to totally destroy\" (cf. Exod. 23:23; I Kgs. 13:34; II Chr. 32:21; Ps. 83:4). The Niphal is used in vv. 9 and 16 with the same meaning. The UBS, Handbook, says it can mean \"deposed\" or \"dismissed,\" as well as \"disposed of\" (p. 291)., 680151=5. The purifying judgment of Israel and the blessings of the divine kingdom, 13:7-14:21, 1045131=11:4 \"Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter\" \"Pasture\" (BDB 944 I, KB 1258). This is a Qal IMPERATIVE (i.e. \"shepherd\"). \"The flock\" seems to refer to God's people (cf. v. 6; Ps. 44:22; Jer. 12:1-3). This phrase does not imply that these are faithful to YHWH, but that they are exploited by their own leaders or foreigners (same ambiguity as 10:3a-b)., 206497=4:8 \"Daniel\" means \"God is my judge\" (BDB 1088)., 856402=1.\u00a04:7, the problems (the surrounding nations) facing Zerubbabel in rebuilding the temple, 818524=4:9 \"the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations of this house\" This text causes controversy when one compares it with Ezra 5:16 and 3:6. There are several possible solutions., 875791=1.\u00a0Jethro, Exod. 3:1, 707388=1:5 \"Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever\" This verse emphasizes the frailty of humanity (both evil and good) versus the eternality of God (cf. Mal. 3:6) and His word (cf. Isa. 40:8; 45:23; 55:11; 59:21; Matt. 5:17-18; 24:35)., 512026=9:27, 1103618=\u25a3 \"and I will also remove the prophets\" The VERB (BDB 716, Hiphil #4, KB 778) is used of removing evil people in I Kgs. 15:12 and II Chr. 15:8., 548613=4.\u00a0Isa. 2:2; Ezek. 38:8; Hos. 3:5 - Israel restored and exalted, 109367=\u25a3 \"the conjurers\" See note at 1:20., 554480=This Hebrew term (BDB 852 IV) originally referred literally to the pain of childbirth (cf. I Sam. 4:19). It came to be used as a metaphor of terrible circumstances (cf. Isa. 13:8; 21:3). This same metaphorical usage of the birth pains of the new age is found in Mark 13:8. Daniel's vision of the \"latter days\" and its interpretation use this word play about \"pain\" and the end-time events about to unfold to him., 823820=4:11 \"What are these\" Again the prophet asks the angelic guide for an interpretation of the vision., 1041349=1.\u00a0floors, I Kgs. 6:15, 713139=2.\u00a0\"I will show you,\" 1:9, 347339=7:10 \"a river of fire was flowing\" The terms \"flowing\" and \"coming out of\" are parallel, possibly hendiadys. This is typical of Daniel's literary style. The metaphor of fire coming from God is a biblical idiom of God coming to His creation for judgment (cf. Ps. 18:7-8; 50:3-6; 97:3; Isa. 30:27-28) as the phrases in v. 10e , \"the court sat\" (cf. vv. 22,26) and 10f, \"the books were opened\" (cf. 12:1) imply., 676857=A. From 1:1 we learn that the prophet began his ministry in the second year of Darius. Most scholars assert that this is Darius I Hystapes (522-486 B.C.), who took over the kingdom after Cambyses II (530-522 B.C.), Cyrus II\u2019s son, committed suicide. See A Brief Historical Survey of the Powers of Mesopotamia, Appendix Two., 221699=The concluding part of this verse is very similar in theological emphasis to 2:20. The entire book of Daniel makes this assertion again and again. To the Ancient Near Eastthe historical situation looked as if YHWH had been defeated by the Babylonian gods, but in reality YHWH was using the empires of the Fertile Crescent (Assyria, Babylon, Persia) to execute His will related to His people (cf. Isa. 10:5; Jer. 51:20). God's people were reaping the consequences of idolatry and rebellion (cf. Deut. 27-29). God needed to reassure His people and inform the pagan empires (v. 25) of the source of their current political and military prowess., 184959=3:29 \"shall be torn limb from limb\" This was an ancient form of execution, as was being burned (cf. Dan. 2:5: I Sam. 15:33)., 41349=For a good discussion compare E. J. Young, The Prophecy of Daniel, pp. 274-275, who believes it refers to the Daniel of the Bible and R. K. Harrison, Introduction to the Old Testament, p. 1105, who believes it refers to a wise man of Canaanite lore., 202134=2.\u00a0\"everlasting kingdom\" (cf. v. 34; 2:44; 6:26; 7:14,26). This is in contrast to the changing kingdom represented by the vision of chapter 2. These last two lines of poetry are very similar to the Hebrew of Ps. 145:13; also see Ps. 45:6; Lam. 5:19., 217431=4:14 \"He shouted out\" Apparently the reader is meant to understand that one of the holy watchers cried out to the other angelic beings (cf. v. 17). Remember, however, this is a highly symbolic and figurative dream, not time-space reality., 936457=8:21 \"to seek the Lord\" There are two parallel phrases:, 39503=1.\u00a0the gold (first kingdom) of chapter 2 as Babylon, 2:38, 464342=This Hebrew construct (BDB 102 plus 815) is translated \"confusion of face\" or \"shame of face\" (cf. v. 8). The same construction is found in II Chr. 32:21. This phrase refers to the exiles of Israel being taken from the Promised Land. This damaged God's reputation among the nations. He wanted to bless Israel and use her as a light to bring the world to Himself (cf. Gen. 12:3; Exod. 19:5-6), but their continual covenant infidelity resulted in judgment for them and a misunderstanding of YHWH by the world (cf. Ezek. 36:22-38)., 493043=1.\u00a0transgression, 8:12,13; 9:24, 146772=2:44 \"in the days of those kings\" It is very important to realize that the coming of the Messiah will be during the fourth kingdom. This is why I believe that it refers to the incarnation of Jesus at Bethlehem during Roman occupation of Palestine; therefore, \"those kings\" would refer to Roman Caesars of the first century and not future kings., 401268=4.\u00a0He did as he pleased, which is a recurrent theme (cf. 5:19; 11:3,16,36-37)., 130797=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:2:24 \u00a024Therefore, Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and spoke to him as follows: \"Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon! Take me into the king's presence, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.\", 338502=a.\u00a0also literally of the Messiah breaking the image in 2:35,45, 219643=4:16 \"let his mind\" This word is literally \"heart,\" which in Hebrew was a metaphor for the mental processes and choices of the person., 534704=2.\u00a0Ish, 9:21; 10:5; 12:6,7, 754957=BDB mentions that it often functions as a way of denoting \"a touch of sympathy,\" p. 223 (cf. Isa. 18:1; 55:1; Jer. 47:6; Zech. 2:10,11)., 355971=\u25a3 \"a son of man was coming\" The Aramaic phrase (\"ben enosh,\" construct BDB 1085 and 1081) \"son of man\" is different from the similar Hebrew phrase (\"ben adam\") found in Psalms and Ezekiel. Both phrases are used in parallel in Job 25:6; Ps. 8:4; 90:3; 144:3; Isa. 13:12. This obviously refers to the Messiah and it links his humanity (cf. 8:17; Job 25:6; Ps. 8:4; Ezek. 2:1), which is the meaning of the Aramaic and Hebrew phrases, \"son of man\" with his deity because the clouds are the transportation of deity (cf. Matt. 24:30; 26:64; Mark 13:26; 14:62; Rev. 1:7; 14:14)., 212828=4:11 This verse has all PARTICIPLES, showing continuing action. The tree (kingdom) was still expanding., 546736=6.\u00a0national angels (Dan. 10:13,20; LXX of Deut. 29:26; 32:8; also Deut. 32:8 has now been found in a Hebrew fragment in the Dead Sea Scrolls)., 22325=2.\u00a0Chapters 7-12 are primarily future events often expressed in apocalyptic imagery in the first person (cf. 7:1,9; 8:1; 9:2)., 91731=\u25a3 \"ten times better\" Eastern literature uses many figures of speech, metaphors, and hyperboles. It also uses numbers in symbolic ways (see Biblical Numerology: A Basic Study of the Use of Numbers in the Bible, by John J. Davis). Ten is the number of completeness (cf. Gen. 31:7,41; Exod. 34:28; Lev. 26:26; Num. 14:22; I Sam. 1:8; 25:38; II Sam. 19:43; I Kgs. 6-7; 11:31,35; II Kgs. 20:9-11; 25:25; II Chr. 4; Neh. 4:12; Job 19:3; Eccl. 7:19; Jer. 41; Ezek. 45;48; Dan. 1:12,14,15,20; Zech. 8:23, the Aramaic form of the Hebrew word in Dan. 7:7,20,24. Also notice Rev. 2:10; 12:3; 13:1; 17:3,7,12,16). To miss the symbolic nature of 1,4,6,7,10, & 12 is to miss a basic literary technique of eastern literature., 822148=\u25a3 \"range to and fro\" This is the Hebrew word \"range\" (BDB 1001-1002, KB 1439). It is used in several senses., 739396=1.\u00a0Why is Zechariah's father omitted in the list of priests in v. 1, but present in Ezra 5:1; 6:14; Neh. 12:4,16?, 748069=\u25a3 \"to measure Jerusalem\" The time factor is crucial, but uncertain: (1) current Jerusalem; (2) restored post-exilic Jerusalem; or (3) heavenly, end-time Jerusalem (cf. Rev. 21:2,15)., 165809=\u25a3 \"governors\" The meaning of this Aramaic governmental term (BDB 1108) is also uncertain. The related Hebrew term denotes \"governors\" (cf. I Kgs. 10:15; 20:24; II Kgs. 18:24; often in Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther; Isa. 36:9; Jer. 51:23,28,57; and several times in the post-exilic prophets)., 613639=11:28 This possibly refers to a successful, but limited, military operation (cf. v. 13) or a failed negotiation (\"at the same table\"). Verse 28 seems to demand a Seleucid victory of some type at the expense of the Ptolemaic empire., 258568=5:6 This is an eyewitness account of the physical deterioration of the king in light of his drunkenness and the supernatural appearance of the hand (cf. v. 9). This also occurred to Daniel in 7:28., 902646=\u25a3 \"sent His Spirit through the former prophets\" This refers to the inspiration of the OT prophets (cf. 1:4; 7:7; Neh. 9:20,30) by the agency of the Holy Spirit (cf. I Pet. 1:11; II Pet. 1:21; \"the God breathed\" of II Tim. 3:16)., 735056=1:18 \"Then I lifted up my eyes and looked\" See note at 1:8. In the Masoretic Hebrew text v. 18 is 2:1 (cf. NJB)., 556372=\u25a3 \"do not be afraid\" See note at 10:12., 539031=10:9 \"sound of his word\" Twice in verse 9 Daniel heard this voice, but passed out before he could receive the message (cf. 8:18; Jer. 31:26; Zech. 4:1; Rev. 1:17)., 680082=4. Eschatological oracles, 12:1-13:6, 1029635=10:11 \"the pride of Assyria\" See note at 9:6., 875849=2.\u00a0Jether, Exod. 4:18, 556220=10:19 \"O man of high esteem\" See note at 10:11., 536805=\u25a3 \"his face had the appearance of lightning\" This brightness of face matches the brightness of the linen. The term \"appearance\" (BDB 909) is used of Daniel's \"visions\" in 8:16,26,27; 9:23 and 10:1., 546373=1.\u00a0Cherubim (Gen. 3:24; Exod. 25:18,22; Ezek. 10), 783201=\u25a3 \"the angel of the Lord\" In this context this is obviously a distinct person from YHWH (cf. vv. 4-5,6-7). He is functioning as a defense advocate, speaking for YHWH. See note at 1:11. It is hard to be certain if this is meant to be a Messianic reference! The Messiah is surely referred to in this chapter as \"My Servant the Branch\" (cf. 6:12; Isa. 4:2; 11:1; 53:2; Jer. 23:5; 33:15)., 967239=9:7 \"I will remove their blood from their mouth\" This may mean that the Philistines will keep the Jewish food laws (cf. Lev. 11; 17:10-16; Deut. 14) and thereby be God's people. Even God's people were accused of eating forbidden, bloody meat (cf. Ezek. 33:25), which violated the Levitical laws. They were destroyed (cf. Ezek. 33:27-28), but these uncircumcized pagans will be saved., 616231=11:30 \"for the ships of Kittim will come against him\" There has been much discussion of the meaning of \"Kittim\" (BDB 508). In the OT it seems to refer to Cypress (cf. Gen. 10:4; Isa. 23:1). However, it came to be used for the Romans (cf. the Dead Sea Scrolls; the Septuagint and Jerome)., 818425=4:8 The revelation is of God, not Zechariah!, 767906=2:10 \"Sing for joy\" This (BDB 943, KB 1247) is a Qal IMPERATIVE. It is an allusion to the \"new day\" promises of Isaiah (cf. 65:18-19; note 25:8; 30:19; 35:10; 51:11; and Rev. 21:4)., 589229=The Hebrew ADJECTIVE (BDB 150) is often used of God (cf. Deut. 10:17; Neh. 9:23; Isa. 10:21; Jer. 32:18). It described Nimrod, the founder of Babylon, as a mighty hunter (cf. Gen. 10:9). It described the Messiah in Isa. 9:5. Its cognate root in Arabic has the connotation of \"one who magnifies himself\" or \"a tyrant,\" which fits Alexander II. The next VERB and OBJECT are the same word (BDB 605-606, KB 647) \"rule and great rule,\" which describes the amazing exploits of Alexander., 624652=\u25a3 \"will do as he pleases\" See full note at 8:4., 737568=1:21 \"so that no man lifts up his head\" This is an idiom of defeat and rejection. Notice the repeat of the term \"lift up\" (BDB 669, KB 724). God's agents will reverse the roles, the scattering horns will be defeated and the defeated Jews' countenance will be lifted up!, 798890=\u25a3 \"seven eyes\" This (BDB 744) refers to (1) eyes or (2) facets of a gem. This, like 4:10 and Ezek. 1:18, seems to be a symbol for God's knowledge., 67977=In English \"Lord\" is used (1) to translate Adon and (2) because the Jews became nervous of pronouncing the covenant name for God - YHWH, all capitals Lord became the way to designate it. For pronunciation the Jews used the vowels for Adon with the consonants for YHWH. See SPECIAL TOPIC: NAMES FOR DEITY at Dan. 4:2., 167630=3:5, 931037=8:16-17 \"these are the things which you should do\" These verses reflect 7:9-10 and 8:8, but they truly reflect the Mosaic legislation. It was very clear to these Jewish people what God's will for them was among each other and foreigners (i.e. two positive commands in v. 16 and two negative commands in v. 17)., 420151=This VERB, Niphal PASSIVE (BDB 842) is used in this form only here in the OT. The basic meaning is \"to be made just or righteous,\" so here it would imply, \"shall be put in right or properly pure condition.\" December 12, 165 b.c. was the date of the cleansing and restoration of the temple in Jerusalem by Judas Maccabeus. See note at v. 11., 712824=1:8 \"I saw\" In Zechariah the Hebrew word \"see\" (BDB 906, KB 1157) is often used to introduce a new vision., 165469=\u25a3 \"prefects\" The meaning of this Aramaic governmental term (BDB 1104) is uncertain, possibly an Akkadian term for those who report directly to the satraps. Daniel was appointed to this position over all the wise men of Babylon in 2:48., 971629=\u25a3 \"For now I have seen with My eyes\" There will be no more invasions of the Promised Land because of God's personal presence and power (cf. Deut. 11:12). This idiom of God's all-knowing presence possibly refers to 4:10., 180899=3:23 After this verse is the place where the Septuagint inserts two Apocryphal writings, \"The Song of the Three Youths\" and \"The Prayer of Assariah.\" These two Apocryphal writings assert that the dew of heaven brought by the angel of the Lord kept the Hebrew youths from death., 527115=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:10:1 \u00a01In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar; and the message was true and one of great conflict, but he understood the message and had an understanding of the vision., 925204=This may be an allusion to Haggai 2:4, who prophesied just before Zechariah. Both of them addressed the same issue\u2014the rebuilding of the temple needs to be finished. Throughout Israel's history God has encouraged His people to be strong and courageous and not to fear (e.g. Josh. 1:6-9; I Chr. 22:13; Isa. 35:4)., 714974=The terms \"dream\" and \"vision\" can be synonymous (cf. Num. 12:6; Isa. 29:7; Dan. 1:12). However, they are distinct in I Sam. 28:6,15., 897953=7:9 \"Dispense true justice\" There is a word play between the NOUN construct (BDB 1048) and the Qal IMPERATIVE (BDB 1047, KB 1622). Covenant people are to treat each other fairly (cf. Micah 6:8). This particular phrase refers to judicial discussions (e.g. Lev. 19:15; Deut. 1:16-17; Prov. 31:9; Ezek. 18:8; 45:9), but has a wider metaphorical implication of appropriate covenant relationships between all the members of God's people. This very term is repeated in 8:16. Injustice offends God (cf. Hosea 4:1-6)., 824311=4:12 \"the two olive branches\" The Hebrew term \"branches\" (BDB 987) is literally \"ear of grain\" (cf. Gen. 41:5; Isa. 17:5) from the idea of \"to hand down.\" However, in this context it refers to the olive branches that contain olives., 979262=9:11 \"the blood of My covenant\" This is a CONSTRUCT of BDB 196 and 136. This can either refer to the original covenant of God with Abraham mentioned in Gen. 15:9-11 or to the Mosaic covenant in Exod. 24:8. This phrase is also used by Jesus in the Upper Room in Mark 14:24. See SPECIAL TOPIC: COVENANT at Zech. 6:15., 785359=\u25a3 \"standing at his right hand\" This language speaks of a judicial setting. The idiom is used of God's presence with His people in Ps. 16:8; 109:31; 110:5, while in Job 30:12; Ps. 109:6, it is used of an accuser, as it is here. The advocate or accuser stood on the defendant's right side., 661208=12:6 \"and one said to the man\" The Masoretic text has \"and he said,\" while the Septuagint and the Vulgate have \"I said.\" In 8:13,14,16 Daniel hears two angels discussing the vision Daniel had just seen, so too, here. Angels are often referred to as \"man.\" See note at 8:16., 655268=\u25a3 \"righteousness\" See Special Topic: Righteousness at 9:17., 435286=The term \"at ease\" (BDB 1017) means quietness in the sense of security, but without warning at such a time and in such a place (probably \"the Beautiful Land,\" i.e. Palestine, cf. 8:9,11,16,41), they will be attacked (cf. 11:21,24)., 336664=7:7 \"a fourth beast\" By the sequencing of chapters 2, 7, and 8 (see Textual Insights A., B., and C.) this refers to the Roman Empire. This would correlate with the iron and clay legs and feet of 2:33,41-43., 309663=6:28 \"in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian\" The footnote reading in the NIV Study Bible, \"of Darius, that is, the reign of Cyrus,\" clearly shows that the Aramaic text (as well as the explicative waw usage in an epexegetical way) is capable of seeing these two kings as one in the same person (cf. Joyce G. Baldwin, Daniel, IVP, p. 132 and D. Winton Thomas, ed. Documents From Old Testament Times, p. 83)., 1080580=\u25a3 \"the Lord of hosts\" This is a common post-exilic title (YHWH Sabaoth), which emphasizes God as military warrior. It seems to see God as the captain of the military army. Verse 5 also recognizes the intervention of the supernatural God, which must be linked to vv. 7 and 8. See SPECIAL TOPIC: NAMES FOR DEITY at Dan. 4:2., 958226=9:3 \"Tyre. . .fortress\" There is a play on the Hebrew word for \"Tyre,\" which is sor (BDB 862), and the Hebrew word for fortress, masor (\"rampart\" or \"siege work\" BDB 848). There was an old city of Tyre and a new Tyre. New Tyre was an island fortress about a half-mile off the coast, with walls over 150 feet high. It was besieged by several Assyrian kings and finally fell to Shelmanezzar V after a five-year siege. It was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar II, but after thirteen years without it falling, Ezek. 29:18 implies that he gave up. It fell to Alexander the Great in 322 b.c. in a seven-month siege. Many commentators speculate that this chapter reflects Alexander the Great's conquest of Palestine in the 330's b.c. as he moved toward Egypt because:, 138958=2:34 \"a stone\" This is a metaphor for the Messiah. He is often spoken of in prophecy as a rock or stone., 988320=9:15 \"The Lord of hosts will defend them\" God Himself will act on His people's behalf. His victory is their victory. The term \"hosts\" in this context would refer to the angelic army at YHWH's command. See Special Topic at Dan. 4:2., 1056874=11:12 \"give me my wages\" This refers to the prophet asking (BDB 396, KB 393, Qal IMPERATIVE) for payment for his services (i.e. \"wages,\" BDB 969 I) from the owners of the flock. This verse is used in Matt. 26:15 to refer to Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus to the High Priests., 179662=3:20, 475564=9:19 Even in an English translation one can feel the intensity ( a series of IMPERATIVES) of Daniel's prayer!, 548510=3.\u00a0Deut. 31:29; Jer. 23:30; 30:24 - Israel's continuing rebellion, 111371=2:3, 1076289=Because of 14:14 some Jewish interpreters see this as Judah being forced to fight against Jerusalem by the invading enemy army (cf. UBS, Handbook, p. 311)., 208858=4:9 \"the chief of the magicians\" Daniel was trained in the language and traditions of the Chaldeans (cf. 1:4). He was made the leader of the Babylonian wise men (cf. 1:20; 2:48). Daniel's abilities were from YHWH, not from Babylonian magic. These Babylonian wise men failed again and again (cf. 2:1-13; 4:7,18). Daniel's position caused later Jewish rabbis to criticize his cooperation with pagan culture and governments., 397260=This is literally \"at the first\" (BDB 321, e.g. 9:21; Gen. 13:3; II Sam. 21:9,10; II Kgs. 17:25; Neh. 11:17), which is idiomatic for the vision Daniel received earlier in Belshazzar's reign (i.e. chapter 7)., 379994=7:27 \"all the kingdoms under the whole heaven\" This sounds very much like Rev. 11:15b., 201733=4:3 \"His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom\" This verse is a poetic/hymnic text extolling God., 78389=These youths, like all the youths, both those in training and those who served Nebuchadnezzar, shared in the king's food and drink (literally in Persian, \"kingly delicacies,\" or \"honorific gifts,\" or \"royal table rations\" (cf. BDB 834 and Dan. 1:5,8,13,15,16; 11:26). These royal provisions were a real honor and perk. This was the best quality and best variety of food available anywhere. It was also provided to Jehoiachin in exile (cf. II Kgs. 25:30; Jer. 52:34). However, it was not levitically \"clean\" (cf. Lev. 11: Deut. 14). It was not kosher., 408758=The Hebrew term gdl (BDB 152, Qal IMPERFECT) appears in vv. 8, 9, 10-11. In 8:8 it means \"magnified himself\"; in 8:9 it means \"grew exceedingly great,\" as it does metaphorically in 8:10, \"it grew great.\" It is obvious that at least two senses are possible., 923341=\u25a3 \"righteousness\" See Special Topic at Dan. 4:27., 878342=\u25a3 \"then you will know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me\" If this is historical, then this is referring to Zechariah (cf. 2:8,9,11; 4:9). If it is eschatological then it refers to Jesus. The inclusion of Gentiles into God's covenant plan does not fit the historical setting of the post-exilic period (esp. Nehemiah and Haggai). The PRONOUNS are ambiguous in this book and could refer to (1) the prophet; (2) an angel in the visions; or (3) the Messiah., 35541=a.\u00a0the book claims to be the visions of Daniel, 7:2,4,6ff, 28; 8:1,15; 9:1-2; 10:2ff; 12:4-8., 1012306=The Hebrew VERB (BDB 823, KB 955, Qal IMPERFECT) means \"visited\" (for blessing, cf. v. 3c; Gen. 50:24; Exod. 3:16; 4:31; 13:19, or for judgment, cf. v. 36; I Sam. 15:2; Lam. 4:22; Hos. 8:13; 9:9). The best parallel passage is Jer. 23:2. In Zech. 11:16 God allows an evil shepherd to decimate the flock., 213445=4:12 The neo-Babylonian empire provided a safe and growing economic climate., 434113=This phrase \"the holy people\" is literally \"the people of the holy ones,\" which is very similar to 7:27. Many scholars believe that the phrase in 7:27 is parallel to \"holy ones\" of 7:18,22, and 25. In context 8:24 cannot refer to angels., 844839=5:9 \"two women\" Some see them as helpers of \"wickedness\" (cf. v. 11). Others see them as God's servants removing the wicked from the Promised Land, but because the word \"wickedness\" is FEMININE, so too, are these angels. These are the only female angels mentioned in all of the Bible., 534840=All angels in the Bible are masculine except in Zech. 5:9., 812320=\u25a3 \"my lord\" This is the Hebrew term adoni (cf. v. 5). See note at 1:9., 594112=11:5 This begins the series of intrigues between the Ptolemies of Egypt (kings of the south) and the Seleucids of Syria (kings of the north). The Jews were caught in the middle of the struggles of these two empires. The rest of verses 5-20 are a summary of the historical conflict, at least up until 175 b.c., 439585=The vision of both 7:28 and 8:27 made Daniel physically ill., 1043196=11:3 \"shepherds' wail\" The metaphor has changed from a burning gate and a cut down forest to a shepherd's weeping over the loss of a pasture land. The metaphor will change again in the last of v. 3 to young lions' roaring because their natural habitat (i.e. \"pride\") is destroyed. Possibly this poem is an allusion to Jer. 25:34-38., 598930=11:11 This fight occurred at the city of Raphai, south of Gaza (217 b.c.). At this battle the Egyptians were initially routed. The larger Seleucid force pursued the Egyptians, but the Egyptians reorganized and attacked and finally won the day. We learn from this battle that Antiochus III (223-187 b.c.) lost 10,000 infantry men, 300 cavalry, and 5 elephants. Also, 4,000 prisoners were taken (cf. Polybius 5:86)., 736857=1:20, 866934=6:9 \"The word of the Lord also came to me\" This is a prophetic formula which introduces a new revelation from YHWH (cf. 1:1,7; 4:6,8; 6:9; 7:1,4,8; 8:1,18). Theologically this asserts that the information is not from human origin, but from a divine source. Inspiration is a crucial, non-compromisable truth. The Bible is not just another \"holy\" book of the world religions!, 362682=7:18 \"but the saints of the Highest One receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever for all ages to come\" This shows the fluidity of this chapter as well as apocalyptic literature between the Highest One (cf. v. 27), the Messiah (cf. v. 13) and His people (cf. vv. 18,22,27). Notice again the emphasis on the eternal nature of the kingdom (cf. v. 27; Dan. 12:2-3). This cannot refer to a millennial kingdom unless it, itself, is a metaphor of the eternal kingdom!, 225927=4:21 \"He gives wisdom to wise men, and knowledge to men of understanding\" In this context it refers to the four Jewish youth, especially Daniel (cf. v. 23) and not at all to the guild of Babylonian wise men., 418241=This same phrase appears in 9:27; 11:31; and 12:11. It refers to different atrocities, but all are connected by rebellion against God and His people. In the Bible it can refer to (1) Antiochus IV; (2) Titus' destruction of Jerusalem in a.d. 70; and (3) the end-time antiChrist (the book of Revelation). It is obviously a multiple fulfillment prophecy., 484342=One of my concerns with this context is that it is presented in the OT prophetic terms of the \"land\" promises to Abraham (Gen. 12,15,16), but the NT expands this into a universal perspective! See Special Topic: The Tension Between Old Covenant Prophetic Models and New Covenant Apostolic Models at Zech. 6:12. Daniel is familiar with the Gentile kings to whom YHWH has revealed Himself and they have praised Him. God's people are wider than racial Jews (cf. Rom. 2:28-29; 9:6; Gal. 3:7-9,29; 6:16; I Pet. 2:5,9; 3:6; Rev. 1:6)., 1021199=10:7 \"Ephraim will be like a mighty man\" The northern ten tribes, so devastated by exile, will be reunited with Judah into one family. The term \"mighty\" (BDB 150) is used of Judah's men in v. 5., 701720=1:3 \"says the Lord of hosts\" This is a direct quote from God (cf. Isa. 31:6; Mal 3:7). This phrase is found in the Hebrew text three times in v. 3, once in v. 4, and again in v. 6 (also note vv. 12 and 16). The title \"Lord of hosts\" occurs at least fifty times in Zechariah., 1123055=D.\u00a0It is obvious that God is still involved in national Israel. Their repentance and faith is coming (cf. Rom. 9-11). The Church, in many ways, has supplemented, complemented, and fulfilled Israel's initial task, which was to be a kingdom of priests to bring all humans to YHWH through the Messiah (cf. Gen. 3:15; 12:3; 18:18; Exod. 19:4-6; I Pet. 2:5,9; Rev. 1:6)., 812501=4:5 The angel questions Zechariah (cf. v. 13), the point being, that without supernatural help Zechariah (i.e. all humans) could not receive the revelation., 1027791=10:11, 940654=2.\u00a0Who does verse 7:2 refer to?, 1114268=13:9 \"And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested\" This refers to the purpose of refining (BDB 864, cf. Mal. 3:2) for strengthening (cf. Isa. 48:10; Dan. 11:35). YHWH wants a purified people who reflect His character! This use of the metallurgical term is quite common in the Bible to describe God testing His people (i.e. the faithful remnant) for approval (cf. Prov. 17:3; Isa. 1:25; 48:10)., 548418=2.\u00a0Num. 24:14; Deut. 4:30 - Israel's return from exile, 479308=The Hebrew term \"understanding\" (BDB 108) is used in 1:20; 8:15; 9:22; 10:1. Daniel was gifted by God and enabled by angelic interpreters to grasp the meaning of the symbolic visions. This particular explanation deals with the seventy years of Jeremiah's prophecy from v. 2., 365052=This phrase is the threefold use of olam (BDB 1106) with the PREPOSITION \"until\" (twice) used of time (BDB 1105, cf. 2:20; 6:15,27; 7:18,26). It is an Aramaic superlative! The concept of \"eternal future\" is expressed often in Daniel using olam (and in other ways also, cf. 6:26) in its various forms and phrases (cf. R. B. Girldestone, Synonyms of the Old Testament, pp. 316-317)., 748355=2:4 \"Run\" Here is one angel commanding (Qal IMPERATIVE) another angel to change an action because of fuller information about God's purposes. Angels do not fully understand God's plans (cf. I Pet. 1:12; Eph. 2:7; 3:10; I Cor. 4:9)., 39697=3.\u00a0the goat (third kingdom) of chapter 8 as Greece, 8:21, 268874=5:20 This verse describes not only Nebuchadnezzar, but all of the Near Eastern potentates whom David served and prophesied about (cf. 2:7,8; 9:24-27; 11:12), including Belshazzar (cf. vv. 22-23)., 468952=\u25a3 \"the curse\" The term \"curse\" (BDB 46) can also be translated \"oath\" (cf. Neh. 10:29). This covenantal terminology goes back to the covenant \"curses and blessings\" of Deut. 27-29, where Israel promises to obey God's word (cf. Deut. 29:11-13). However, if they rebel and disobey, God's oath becomes a curse (cf. Deut. 29:18,19,20; 30:7; II Chr. 334:24; Jer. 29:18-19)., 148275=2:45 \"a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands\" This may be a veiled allusion to the virgin birth of the Messiah (cf. Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14) and the incarnation at Bethlehem. Even the Jewish commentators Rashi and Eben-Ezra see this as a Messianic passage., 477661=9:21 \"then the man Gabriel\" This is a messenger angel. His name means \"man of God\" (BDB 150, cf. 8:16). He is only one of two angels whose names are mentioned in the Bible, Gabriel and Michael., 875521=3.\u00a0Yeshoshu'a, Joshua 1:1, 395186=G.\u00a0As is typical of Hebrew literature, a general account (chapter 7) is followed by a more detailed description of one particular aspect (e.g. Gen. 1:1-2:3 vs. 2:4-25)., 375610=Brown, Driver, Briggs (1084, Pael IMPERFECT) has \"figurative for harass continually.\" The Hebrew counterpart is used similarly in I Chr. 17:9. It is normally used for wearing out clothing. The same surprising divine permission to persecute and overcome the saints (\"holy ones\") is found in Rev. 11:7 (the two witnesses are a symbol for the whole people of God) and 13:7! God allows evil to fully reveal itself and its intentions so that its judgment, punishment, and removal/isolation is understood as fair and just., 288125=\u25a3 \"Darius\" See note at 5:31., 1082247=12:6 \"In that day\" See note at v. 4., 653221=\u25a3 \"contempt\" This Hebrew term (BDB 201) is used only here and in Isa. 66:24. Jesus used this Isaiah text to describe Gehenna (cf. Matt. 3:12)., 791140=3:5 \"I said\" This refers to the speaker of v. 4, but who is it? The last phrase of v. 5 implies it was not the angel of the LORD, but the LORD. J. Baldwin (Tyndale OT commentaries, p. 114) thinks it is Zechariah (\"and I said\") who blurts out the need for the complete high priestly outfit., 624804=\u25a3 \"he will exalt and magnify himself\" These two VERBS (BDB 926, KB 1202 and BDB 152, KB 178) are synonymous. This action reflects the little horn of 8:11,25. It reflects the same attitude as Nebuchadnezzar in 4:30-31 and 5:20 (cf. Isa. 14:13-15)., 538823=10:8 \"natural color turned to a deathly pallor\" The Hebrew phrase is very intense. This vision scared Daniel badly (cf. vv. 16-17; 7:28; 8:27)., 505815=1.\u00a0literally of trees, Jer. 6:10; 10:3; 22:7; 46:23, 252331=5:2 \"When Belshazzar tasted the wine\" This either refers to (1) his beginning the traditional drinking period after the dinner or (2) the fact that he was already intoxicated., 1133716=14:7 \"For it will be a unique day which is known to the Lord\" This possibly refers to Matt. 24:36 and reenforces the understanding that this section refers to God the Father. The uniqueness may be that there is no more night (cf. TEV)., 421958=8:16 \"Gabriel\" Only two angels are named in the Bible, Gabriel and Michael. Michael is called the Archangel of Israel (cf. 10:13,21; 12:1; Jude v. 9), while Gabriel seems to be God's messenger angel (cf. 9:21; Luke 1:19,26). His name means \"man of God\" or \"strong man of God\" (BDB 150)., 707157=The phrase \"give heed\" is from the Hebrew root which means \"pay close attention to\" (cf. Jer. 6:17; 11:7,8). This phrase is an allusion to Jer. 7:24,26; 17:23; 19:15; 29:19., 427722=In the context of the book of Daniel this indignation (BDB 276) has to do with the independence and arrogance of the Gentile nations who God used to judge His people. Their arrogance is projected into the distant future (i.e. Greece for 8:19 and end-time Antichrist for 11:36 [cf. 7:8,20-22,23-26; II Thess. 2; Rev. 12-13]). Now He will judge these Gentile nations (cf. 11:36)., 969244=3.\u00a0military units or leaders (e.g. Exod. 18:21,25; Deut. 1:15), 144590=2:40 \"a fourth kingdom\" This kingdom is described in 2:40-43; 7:7-8. It is never named as are the first three. In some ways it refers to Rome, but also to a type of worldwide human government, which is opposed to God. It has a historical reference (Rome) and a future reference (end-time anti-God world empire, cf. 9:25-27; 11:36-45)., 52913=B.\u00a0It is the apocalyptic aspect of Daniel and Zechariah, which expands the Jewish restoration into universal categories. Even the demise of the Jewish state was a part of the larger plan of God (cf. Rom. 9-11) to include all mankind into His covenant (cf. Matt. 24:14,15)., 307704=6:24 \"the lions overpowered them\" Daniel's deliverance was not attributable to lions that were not hungry!, 602645=11:15 Ptolemy V was only 4 years old when his father died. Therefore, one of his best generals, Scopas, was in charge and he attacked the north. However, he was defeated in the field and retreated to the city of Sidon where he lost his entire army of 100,000 elite soldiers (198 b.c.)., 973608=This first term \"just\" or \"righteous\" (BDB 841-843) seems to be used in several passages in the prophets to describe the ethical reign of the Messiah (cf. Isa. 9:7; 11:4,5; 16:5; 32:1; Jer. 23:5-6). The Messiah is called \"the Righteous One\" in the Suffering Servant song of Isa. 53:11. He is qualified to reign by lineage and actions., 351465=7:12 \"as for the rest of the beasts. . .extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time\" The phrases in Aramaic \"for a season\" and \"and a time\" are other examples of hendiadys. They mean the same thing. The nations continued to exist, but without their previous power and world influence. Their influence is limited and will be removed (cf. 2:21 and 7:18,22,27). This would therefore, refer to Iraq (Babylon), Iran (Persia), Greece, and Italy (Rome). Notice the theme of God's sovereignty over the nations continues (\"for an appointed period of time\"). The Bible is teleological, not cyclical. History is moving toward a consummation!, 1105540=\u25a3 \"pierce him through\" This is the same term used in 12:10 and the implication is that he is pierced by his parents because he is a false prophet and a blasphemer. This may be so that the whole family may not be judged (cf. Jer. 23:34). This is exactly the reason that the Jews crucified Jesus because they saw Him as a false prophet and a blasphemer., 1073055=\u25a3 \"lays the foundation of the earth\" This refers to creation (cf. Job 38:4-6; Ps. 102:25-26 [Heb. 1:10-12]; 104:5; Isa. 48:13; 51:13,16). It may be an allusion to Isa. 42:5. In chapters 12-14 this term (BDB 75-76) is used in several ways., 274680=\u25a3 \"the Chaldean king\" The term \"Chaldean\" is used in an ethnic sense (cf. 9:1 and Herodotus) in this text, but as a class of wise men or astrologers in 2:2,4,5,10 (twice); 3:8; 4:7; 5:7,11. The Babylonians themselves never used the term in an ethnic sense in their own documents, but the Assyrians did., 819766=\u25a3 \"Then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me\" Although NASB (1971) and NKJV have the PRONOUN \"me\" capitalized, most other English translations, including the 1995 Updated NASB, do not. This phrase probably relates to Zechariah (cf. 2:8,9,11; 4:9; 6:15)., 134936=However, with further revelation (i.e. NT), we realize that the term \"latter days\" often refers to the period between the incarnation of the Messiah at Bethlehem and His coming again in power and glory at His Second Coming (cf. Acts 2:17 quoting Joel 2:28-32). This is basically an overlapping of the two Jewish ages., 76577=The context seems to imply a knowledge of all Chaldean literature (ethnic sense, cf. Gen. 11:28,31; II Kgs. 24-25; often in Isaiah and Jeremiah; Dan. 1:4; 5:30; 9:1; Ezra 5:12) rather than just magical, astrological, and religious texts (magi sense, cf. 2:2-5,10; 4:4; 5:7,11, used by Herodotus, Diodorus, and Strabo)., 676604=SPECIAL TOPIC: MATTHEW 27:9, 534937=This bright white linen (BDB 94 I) is often associated with angelic appearances (cf. Gen. 18:2; Jdgs. 13:3,6; Ezek. 9:2,3,11; 10:2,6,7; Dan. 8:16; 9:21; 12:6,7; Luke 24:4 and Acts 1:10). This angel is described in ways that often depict God and the resurrected Christ in Rev. 1. This angel is associated with YHWH's throne., 412564=3.\u00a0a powerful angel, v. 13; 10:1-9; or Michael, Israel's national angel, 10:13,31; 12:1, 291890=6:5 \"unless we find it against him in regard to the law of his God\" These administrators were wise enough to realize that the only area in which Daniel could be accused was in his loyalty to the Hebrew faith., 1053651=\u25a3 \"What is to die, let it die\" The first VERB (BDB 559, KB 562) is Qal ACTIVE PARTICIPLE, FEMININE, SINGULAR and obviously refers to the sheep. The second is a Qal IMPERFECT used in a JUSSIVE sense. The sheep are going to die. Their sins have found them out (similar to Rom. 1:24,26,28)., 80409=1:7 The names were changed to: (1) break the ties with the past or (2) associate with the Babylonian deities., 875591=4.\u00a0Yeshu'a, Neh. 8:17, 532787=10:2 \"mourning\" This refers to fasting (v. 3) and prayer. The exact reason is not stated: (1) for the sinning of God's people as in 9:1-19; (2) for God's mercy on His people both now and in the tension-filled future (v. 1); (3) for God's destruction of Israel's enemies and God's redemptive plan for all the world through Israel; or (4) for greater understanding relating to this vision., 940564=1.\u00a0Why is there a lapse of time between 1:1 and 7:1?, 503340=9:26, 930869=8:15 Judgment is God's last resort. He wants to bless (e.g. Hos. 11:8) to fulfill His larger redemptive purposes., 142680=2:37 \"to whom the God of heaven has given\" The VERB (BDB 1095) is a Peal PERFECT. Notice the continuing emphasis on God's sovereignty (cf. 1:2,9,17). He allows kings to rise and prosper (i.e. \"the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the glory\")., 826429=Context, not a lexicon or dictionary, must determine meaning. Authorial intent as expressed in an inspired text must take precedence. A similar lexical problem with the word/concept of anointing is found in James 5:14, where an unexpected non-religious word for anointing is used., 1127471=14:3 YHWH fights on behalf of His people as He did in the exodus from Egypt and the conquest and settlement of Canaan., 917735=\u25a3 \"the Holy Mountain\" It is holy because YHWH's presence is there. His presence must be reflected in His people (cf. Deut. 28:9). They must be different; they must be like Him (e.g. Lev. 19:2 [I Pet. 1:16]; Matt. 5:48). See Special Topic: Holy at Dan. 4:8., 76933=\u25a3 \"Chaldeans\" Herodotus (450 b.c.), Hist. I, uses this term to refer to an ethnic group (cf. II Kgs. 24:1-4; Dan. 5:30) as well as a priestly class (cf. Dan. 2:2; 3:8; 4:7; 5:7,11) whose usage goes back to Cyrus II. Even before this Assyrian records used the term (BDB 505) in an ethnic sense (cf. R. K. Harrison, Introduction to the Old Testament, p. 1113). Also read the good discussion of the possibility of a confusion of two similar terms (i.e. Kal-du vs. Kasdu) in The Expositors Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 14-15 or Robert Dick Wilson, Studies in the Book of Daniel, series 1., 1045591=11:5 \"Those who buy them slay them\" A Qal ACTIVE PARTICIPLE (BDB 888, KB 1111) is followed by a Qal IMPERFECT (BDB 246, KB 255). This is the allusion of the new owners of the sheep who use them for food (not wool). This may typify careless and uncompassionate acts of merchants or governmental leaders (cf. 10:3)., 498414=The reason that some scholars deny that this phrase refers to the Messiah (cf. NET Bible, Second Beta Ed., p. 1551, footnote 23) is because there is an accent mark (athnach) in the Hebrew Masoretic Text, which denotes a disjunction. However, in the first place, the accent marks of the MT are not inspired, but are Jewish rabbinical traditions, and second, this mark does not always denote a complete stop, but here possibly accents the distinction between the time period of seven weeks and sixty-two weeks (cf. Christology of the Old Testament, by E. W. Hengstenberg, pp.415-417; H. C. Leupold, Exposition of Daniel, pp. 417-426; and Hard Sayings of the Bible, pp. 318-320)., 199296=\u25a3 \"all the peoples, nations, and men of every language\" We must remember that the kingdom of neo-Babylon included many language groups (cf. 3:4,7,29; 6:25). This chapter seems to be a royal decree issued to praise the God of Judah for Nebuchadnezzar's restoration., 902001=7:12 \"they made their hearts like flint\" This Hebrew term (BDB 1038 I) refers to some kind of very hard material like corundum or diamond (cf. Jer. 17:1). It is used metaphorically here of the hardness of the Jewish ancestors' hearts toward God. This same metaphor of hardness is used in a positive way in Ezek. 3:9 for God equipping the prophet to face strong opposition., 121368=9.\u00a05:19, \"feared and troubled\", 1133367=The second Hebrew phrase has two words: (1) \"precious,\" \"rare,\" \"splendid,\" \"weighty\" (BDB 429) and (2) \"thicken,\" \"condense,\" \"congeal\" (BDB 891, KB 1117, Qal IMPERFECT). The NASB footnote has \"glorious ones will congeal.\", 1010939=This discussion of a divine shepherd sets the stage for chapters 11-13. Zechariah is unique in his imagery of a wounded shepherd (cf. 12:10; 13:7), which is theologically parallel to the Suffering Servant of Isa. 53 (the same Hebrew term, \"afflicted\" (BDB 776 III) is used in Isa. 53:4,7)., 506002=Another covenant usage is its relationship to berith (\"to cut a covenant\"), where an animal was cut in half and the covenant partners walked through the dead animal to signal the consequences of a covenant violation\u2014death (cf. Gen. 15:17; Jer. 11:10; 31:31,32,33; 34:18-19)., 945858=A.\u00a0This begins a new section of the book. Zechariah 9:2-11:3 is in a poetic format (NASB, NKJV, NRSV, NJB). As chapters 1- 8 are dated specifically and the author is specified (cf. 1:1), chapters 9-14 are undated and the author's name is not mentioned. This pattern is common in the prophetic books (cf. Isa. 1-39 and 40-66; Ezek. 1-39 and 40-48; Dan. 1-6 and 7-12)., 835141=5:2 \"he said to me\" Apocalyptic literature is characterized by dialogue between a human and an angelic being. Zechariah has more angelic interaction than any other book of the OT., 222378=4:18 \"inasmuch as none of the wise men of my kingdom is able\" This is a recurrent theme (cf. 1:20; 2:4-13; 4:7; 5:7-8)., 1111013=13:7 There is an obvious radical break between vv. 6 and 7. As v. 6 refers to false prophets, v. 7 refers to the coming Messiah. Notice in your translation that 13:1-6 is in prose, while 13:7-9 is poetry. This poetry is definitely related to 11:4-14, which describes the godly shepherd., 822572=3.\u00a0for seeking one who is godly, Jer. 5:1, 307150=6:24 \"and they cast them, their children and their wives into the lions' den\" This type of family-wide punishment is known in Persia from Herodotus 3.119. This is the Hebrew concept of corporality: (1) Adam and Eve's sin affects all humans (cf. Gen. 3); (2) Korah's rebellion in Num. 16:25-33; (3) Achan's sin in Josh. 7 affected the whole Israeli army and the death of his family and cattle. This same idea of corporality can be seen in Esther 9:10-14. The NT counterpart is Rom. 5:12-21., 558585=10:21, 86949=1:11, 5459=D.\u00a0Is prophecy and apocalyptic literature locked into a specific historical fulfillment? Surely the specific prophecies about the Messiah establish predictive prophecy as valid (e.g. Micah 5:2). However, Isa. 14:7 (virgin birth) and Dan. 9:27; 11:31; 12:11; Matt. 24:15; Mark 13:14 are good examples of multiple fulfillment prophecy. Prophecy and apocalyptic passages are not exhausted in specific historical fulfillments. Here is a good quote on this subject from Joyce G. Baldwin, Daniel, The Tyndale Old Testament Commentary,, 1106651=3.\u00a0Elisha, I Kgs. 19:19; II Kgs. 2:13,14, 466949=The term \"forgiveness\" used here is a rare form (PLURAL, ABSTRACT, INTENSIVE, \"abundantly forgive\") of the word (BDB 699); it is also used in Neh. 9:17. The unemphasized form is found in v. 19., 366112=7.\u00a0\"everlasting dominion,\" 4:34; 7:14, 236180=4:34 \"at the end of that period\" This refers to the specific time mentioned in 4:16, \"seven periods of time.\" Most commentators think it refers to years, but this is speculation. However, the specificity confirms that God is in control of Nebuchadnezzar's condition and healing., 618843=11:34 \"Now when they fall they will be granted a little help\" This seems to be the only biblical reference to the revolt of Judas Macabbeas, the son of the priest Mattathias of Modim. He rededicated the temple in Dec. 165 b.c., which is the source of the modern Jewish celebration known as Hanukkah or the Festival of Lights, which remembers the cleansing of the temple. Notice \"they\" could not do it without supernatural, divine aid!, 289283=6:2, 1077991=\u25a3 \"I will strike every horse with bewilderment, and his rider with madness\" This is related to the curse of Deut. 28:28 (both BDB 1067, \"bewilderment\" and BDB 993, \"madness\"); also \"blindness\" (BDB 234) is used in Deut. 28 and 29. The history of God's OT people can be viewed through the cursing and blessing section of Deut. 27-29., 888579=The Hebrew word dbr (BDB 182) is used regularly for God's revelation (cf. 1:1,6,7; 4:6; 7:1,4,7,12; 8:1,18; 9:1; 11:11; 12:1)., 344775=\u25a3 \"the Ancient of Days took His seat\" There is no definite ARTICLE with this unique Aramaic title \"ancient of days\" here, so it may emphasize the quality of timelessness (\"one that was ancient of days\"). The ARTICLE is present in vv. 13 and 22. This title is related to the characterization of God as \"living\" in 4:34; 6:26; 12:7. The covenant name, YHWH, is from the CAUSATIVE form of the Hebrew VERB \"to be\" (cf. Exod. 3:14), the Ever Living One!, 94638=1:21 \"first year of Cyrus\" This seems to contradict 10:1, but the meaning is that Daniel lived during the entire exilic period and into the reign of Cyrus II, \"the Great\" (cf. 6:28). Daniel fully lived out Jeremiah's prophecy (cf. 25:11,12; 29:10)., 269795=5:23 \"but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven\" As Nebuchadnezzar was humbled by YHWH (cf. Dan. 4) so too, his descendant, Belshazzar, who had purposely violated the sanctity of YHWH's temple vessels., 220991=4:17 \"This sentence is by the decree of the angelic watchers, And the decision is a command of the holy ones\" This seems to imply that the angels made the decision on their own, but verse 24 shows the ultimate source of this decision was God. Again, it is important to realize that the Jews were uncertain at this time about their covenant relationship with God because the temple and Jerusalem (cf. Deut. 12:10) had been destroyed and the Davidic king taken into exile (cf. II Sam. 7). They needed Him to show them that He was in control of all of world history., 976666=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:9:11-17 \u00a011As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, \u00a0I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. \u00a0\u00a012Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; \u00a0This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. \u00a0\u00a013For I will bend Judah as My bow, \u00a0I will fill the bow with Ephraim. \u00a0And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; \u00a0And I will make you like a warrior's sword. \u00a014Then the Lord will appear over them, \u00a0And His arrow will go forth like lightning; \u00a0And the Lord God will blow the trumpet, \u00a0And will march in the storm winds of the south. \u00a015The Lord of hosts will defend them. \u00a0And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; \u00a0And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine; \u00a0And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, \u00a0Drenched like the corners of the altar. \u00a0\u00a016And the Lord their God will save them in that day \u00a0As the flock of His people; \u00a0For they are as the stones of a crown, \u00a0Sparkling in His land. \u00a0\u00a017For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! \u00a0Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins., 211359=4:10 \"behold\" A Handbook on the Book of Daniel, by UBS, pp. 106-107, notes that this Aramaic interjection (BDB 1080) and its Hebrew equivalent (BDB 243) are used often in Daniel, but usually not translated., 859985=1.\u00a0breath, vv. 5,6,8,9,10 (cf. Gen. 6:17; 7:15,22), 500064=\u25a3 \"there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. . .one week\" The seventy units of seven will be broken into three time periods: one unit of seven sevens (v. 25); one unit of sixty- two sevens (v. 25); and one unit of one seven (v. 27). The crux for commentators has been how these relate to each other: (1) are they sequential or (2) are there time segments between these three time units? For me this issue is the symbolic nature of the number (i.e. 70) and its previous use in 9:2 (the quote from Jeremiah). This number is used of God's sovereign plan for Israel's punishment (cf. Jer. 25:9-13; 29:10) and restoration (cf. Jer. 30:18-22; 31:38-40). Numerical precision is not the focus, but divine sovereignty over time, history, and redemption!, 968052=1.\u00a0those who survived a divine catastrophe (e.g. Philistines, cf. Amos 1:8; Jer. 47:4 and Jews, cf. Isa. 37:4,31-32; 40:11; 42:2; Jer. 25:20), 255459=5:4 \"praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone\" These are the same metals involved in the statue of chapter 2. From v. 23 we realize that these were idols (cf. Exod. 20:23; Deut. 4:28; 28:36,64; 29:17; Ps. 115:4-8; 135:15-18; Isa. 40:18-20; 44:9-20; 46:1-7). This phrase may imply that this banquet had religious or ritual connotations., 653475=12:3 \"and those who have insight\" This is a recurrent theme. This same phrase (BDB 968) is used in 11:33,35 (the faithful during the reign of Antiochus IV). Daniel 12:10 shows that this does not refer to degrees of intelligence, but the distinction between the saved and the lost. \"Those who have insight\" is used in 9:13,25 to note those who understand and act on the truth revealed by God. In 11:33 the insight is meant to be passed on to others, but they will be killed for their actions., 956440=9:2 The NKJV adds the word \"against\" from v. 1 here (twice) assuming the context refers to punishment, but TEV links this verse with the phrase \"belong to the Lord\" (cf. NJB, v. 1) and thereby turns it into an affirmation of YHWH's love for the nations. The context, especially v. 4, favors NKJV's understanding., 750931=\u25a3 \"cattle\" This was a symbol of great prosperity (cf. Deut. 28:4,11,51; 30:9). This is the opposite of Hag. 1:10-11., 333660=This is a parallel to the ram of 8:4, where the ribs may relate to the three directions or areas of conquest: Babylon to the West, Lydia to the North, and Egypt to the South. Ben Ezra thinks they refer to three cities which were conquered. We know from historical records that Medo-Persia did not have many conquests to the East until the reign of Darius I Hystapes., 974017=The term \"salvation\" (BDB 446, KB 448) is a Niphal PARTICIPLE used in the sense of someone who is made victorious or someone who is delivered. Both of these terms are used together in Isa. 45:8; 46:13; 51:4,5., 1084573=\u25a3 \"the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the Lord before them\" This is a striking metaphor used in the sense of God's empowering of His people. The term for God is the term Elohim, which is used in the sense of supernatural beings (cf. Exod. 4:16; 7:1; I Sam. 28:13; Ps. 8:5; 82:1,6)., 69297=\u25a3 \"Shinar\" This is another name for Babylon (cf. Gen. 10:10; 11:2; 14:1,9; Isa. 11:11; Zech. 5:11). The meaning of Shinar is uncertain (BDB 1042). It somehow relates to the Sumerian civilization of southern Iraq (cf. Gen. 10:10), which is the earliest known civilization to use writing (cuneiform script on clay tablets). It is the site of the building of the tower of Babel (cf. Gen. 11:1-9). It becomes an idiom for evil and rebellion (cf. Zech. 5:11)., 362355=7:17 \"these great beasts, which are four in number, are four kings who will rise upon the earth\" This is the angel's interpretation of the successive nature of the kingdoms mentioned in the vision. The first had already come (i.e. Nebuchadnezzar)., 123293=\u25a3 \"the captain of the king's bodyguard\" The term \"bodyguard\" (BDB 1094) is literally \"the chief slaughter\" (KB 368, possibly from butcher) or \"executioner.\" In v. 15 he is called \"the King's commander\" (cf. II Kgs. 25:8,11)., 746603=2:1 \"Then I lifted up my eyes and looked\" See full note at 1:8. In the Masoretic Hebrew text this verse is 2:5 because the second vision (the four horns) starts chapter two., 729263=1:15 This is a very significant verse. Although God used godless nations to judge His people (cf. Isa. 10:5; 47:6; Jer. 25:9; 51:20), apparently these nations went far beyond what God wanted and they would be punished for their excesses. In the Ancient Near Eastmilitary victory was a spiritual as well as military issue. YHWH explains why He allowed the pagan empires of Assyria and Babylon to oppress His people. He also explained that they went beyond His desires and purposes. The current conditions do not reflect God's intended desires nor do they truly reflect His feelings for a restored Judah., 135499=2:29 Predictive prophecy is one of the greatest evidences that the Bible really is the only inspired self-revelation of the one true God (cf. vv. 45,47). The Bible is the only world religion holy book that has predictive prophecy., 793922=3:7 \"If you will walk in My ways\" Notice the conditional element of a daily covenant lifestyle faith (i.e. \"walk,\" e.g. Deut. 8:6; 10:12; 28:9). Biblical faith is a way of life, not a building, a creed, or a special event or ritual. By their fruits you will know who knows God (cf. Matt. 7)., 1106577=2.\u00a0Elijah, I Kgs. 19:13; II Kgs. 2:8, 534219=\u25a3 \"I was by the bank of the great river, that is, the Tigris\" Apparently he was on a governmental assignment, as in 8:27., 42834=D.\u00a0The first person singular pronoun is used often in the book (cf. 7:1,9; 8:1-2; 9:1-10:2). This implies Daniel was the author of the book that bears his name. This would date the book within his life time (seventh century b.c.)., 232439=\u25a3 \"by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty\" Several of these words are used in 2:37, where Nebuchadnezzar's possession of these is directly attributed to the God of Judah. All he has is a gift from God, but he thinks it is all from himself (cf. vv. 26,31,32; 2:37,44)., 657498=This Hebrew term (BDB 1001, KB 1439) means moving about quickly. It is used of God's knowledge of the events on earth (cf. Zech. 4:10). It is also used of a person's frantic search (cf. Jer. 5:1). In Jer. 49:3 it is used for the confusion and fear caused by a siege. It is obvious that it denotes a frantic activity, but exactly how that relates to Dan. 12:4 is uncertain., 1102279=13:2 \"it will come about in that day, declares the Lord of hosts\" This is the continuing use of the eschatological phrase, \"that day,\" combined with the common post-exilic title for God, which implies military power., 875453=2.\u00a0Hoshe'a, Deut. 32:44, 412756=\u25a3 \"it removed the regular sacrifice from Him and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down\" This seems to refer to something involving the daily morning and evening sacrifices in the temple ritual called \"the continual\" (cf. Exod. 29:38-42; Num. 28:1-8). This daily ritual was stopped (\"removed,\" BDB 926, KB 1202, Hophal PERFECT; the second VERB BDB 1020, KB 1527, may refer to the same event) by Antiochus IV Epiphanes and he further defiled the temple by regularly offering a swine on the altar and placing an image of Zeus in the Holy Place (cf. 11:31; 12:11). Antiochus tried to Hellenize the Jews (cf. I Macc. 1.54-61; II Macc. 4.11-6.11) by forcing them to eat the flesh of swine. This caused the rebellion of the priest of Moden, whose son, Judas Maccabees, through an extended guerilla warfare, finally succeeded in defeating the Seleucid army and, in 165 b.c., cleansed and restored the temple. In modern times, this is known as the Festival of Lights (Hanukkah) , and is celebrated in December (the date changes each year because the Jews use a lunar calendar)., 364500=Also notice the Aramaic ADJECTIVE \"Most High\" is PLURAL in vv. 18,22,25,27, while the SINGULAR is in 3:26,32; 4:21,22,29,31; 5:18,21. Notice in v. 25 both forms occur as a title for God. This same fluctuation is found with the Hebrew ADJECTIVE. This does not relate to polytheism, but probably to the Semitic grammatical feature called the PLURAL OF MAJESTY., 616616=If this does refer to Rome then it may relate to the Roman consul Gaius Popilius Laenas' confrontation in 172 b.c. of Antiochus IV as he besieged Alexandria, Egypt. The account of this confrontation is found in Cicero, Philippus 8.8; Livy, Ab Lrbe Condita 45.10,15; and Polybius 29:1., 586289=11:2 For \"A Brief Historical Survey of the Powers of Mesopotamia\" see Appendix Three., 40072=1.\u00a0taken into exile in 606 b.c. by neo-Babylon, 1:1 (third year of Jehoiakim, King of Judah), 771897=2:12 \"the Lord will possess Judah as His portion\" Both the VERB (BDB 635, KB 686, Qal PERFECT) and \"His Portion\" (BDB 324) relate to inheritance (cf. Exod. 19:5; 34:9; Deut. 4:20; 7:6; 9:26,29; 14:2; 32:9; Ps. 33:2; Titus 2:14; I Pet. 2:9). The historical allusion is to the dividing of Palestine among the Jewish tribes by lot (cf. Josh. 12-19)., 454455=\u25a3 \"God\" See SPECIAL TOPIC: NAMES FOR DEITY at 4:2., 858101=6:3, 714595=\u25a3 \"at night\" Does this imply revelation by dreams or that a vision came in the night-time? God often used dreams to reveal Himself, especially in Genesis (cf. 20:3,6; 31:10-11,24; 37:5-20; 40-41). Dreaming even becomes a way of identifying a true prophet (cf. Deut. 13:1,3,5; Jer. 23:25-32)., 921945=8:8 \"My people and I will be their God\" This is covenant language (e.g. Lev. 26:12; Deut. 4:20; 18:2; 29:12-13; Jer. 31:33; 32:38; Hos. 2:23) and clearly shows that the covenant is restored., 293772=6:7 These government officials appealed to the egotism and pride of the king. Quite often leaders are susceptible to this trickery., 44838=8.\u00a0chapter 9 - in the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent. If Darius of 5:31, then 538 b.c., 536252=\u25a3 \"beryl\" This (BDB 1076 I) was a type of jewel (cf. Ezek. 28:13) either yellow jasper (cf. Exod. 28:20; 39:13) or golden in color (cf. Ezek. 1:16; 10:9), associated with (1) one of the stones on the High Priest's vest (cf. Exod. 28:20; (2) part of Ezekiel's vision of God's throne chariot (cf. Ezek. 1:16; 10:9); (3) one of the precious stones of the Garden of Eden in Ezekiel's vision of 28:13; and (4) part of the new Jerusalem (cf. Rev. 21:20)., 983646=Two other prophets use this same term in connection with Greece, Dan. 11:2 and Joel 3:6. Isaiah uses this term often in connection with God directing the history of His people (e.g. \"the Medes,\" 13:17; \"one from the east,\" 41:2; \"one from the north,\" 41:25; \"Cyrus,\" 45:13; \"Jerusalem and Zion,\" 51-52). Isaiah's use of this term in chapters 51 and 52 may parallel Zech. 9:13d, \"I will make you like a warrior's sword.\" It is God's strength and purpose, but He chooses to use human instrumentality., 661891=12:7 \"as he raised his right hand and his left toward heaven\" This is an OT oath gesture (cf. Deut. 32:40; Isa. 62:8; Ezek. 20:5 and in the NT, Rev. 10:5, 6). Both hands being raised must denote intensity or solemnity., 71616=1:3 \"Ashpenaz\" His name's meaning is uncertain (BDB 80), but (1) a possible Persian origin would suggest \"guest\" or \"chief eunuch\" or (2) an Armenian origin, \"guest,\" \"friend,\" or \"stranger.\", 586439=\u25a3 \"And now I will tell you the truth\" This is an idiom which means that the message is trustworthy and accurate (cf. 8:26; 10:1,21). See fuller note at 10:1., 971913=9:9 \"Rejoice greatly\" This (BDB 162, KB 189, plus ADVERB 547) is a Qal IMPERATIVE (cf. Zech. 2:10; Zeph. 3:14,15). This is a shout of joy over the military conquest by YHWH's Messiah. This rejoicing includes both Jews and Gentiles (cf. 2:10-13). This inclusion is so surprising and unexpected (cf. Zeph. 3:14-20)., 263311=These three characterizations are meant to reflect Daniel's supernatural abilities to know and interpret visions, dreams, etc. (cf. v. 14). The next phrase, \"the wisdom of the gods\" accentuates Daniel's God-given gifts (cf. v. 12; 1:17,20)., 643731=1.\u00a09:25 for the Messiah, 809319=4:1 \"the angel who was speaking with me\" This refers to the angel guide (cf. 1:9,19; 2:3; 4:1,4,5; 5:5,10; 6:4). These angel guides and interpreters are common in apocalyptic literature (cf. Ezek. 8:2-3; 40:3-4; Dan. 7:16; 8:16-17; 9:22; 10:18-21)., 668533=\u25a3 \"the abomination of desolation is set up\" Some see this phrase (BDB 1055, 1030) as referring to Antiochus IV setting up an altar to Zeus in the temple during the Macabbean period (cf. Dan. 8:11-13). Others see it as referring to the anti-God world ruler of the end-time (cf. 7:21,25; 8:23-26; 9:25-27; 11:36-45). The phrase is ambiguous enough to fulfill several historical situations., 476690=9:20 Notice all the PARTICIPLES, which basically refer to the same act., 542737=\u25a3 \"humbling yourself before God\" This term's basic meaning is \"to be bowed down\" (BDB 776 III). In the Hithpael form it is also found in Ezra 8:21, where it is used of prayer and fasting (cf. 9:3,20; 10:2-3; also note Ps. 35:13)., 764403=\u25a3 \"He has sent me\" This \"Me\" is capitalized in NASV (1970) and KJV (1982), which shows that those translators thought it referred to the Messiah, so too, Kimchi (Jewish exegete from the Middle Ages in Europe). The NET Bible and the TEV interpret this as another reference to Zechariah (this would make vv. 9-11; 4:9; and 6:15 also refer to Zechariah). There is no doubt that the Messiah is mentioned in 3:8; 6:12-13 in the first division of Zechariah (chapters 1-8), but here the context implies the prophet (cf. NASB, 1995 Update)., 148604=\u25a3 \"without hands\" This is a metaphor of God's agency (cf. 8:25; Zech. 4:6). This is another way that God's control apart from human affect or agency is emphasized (cf. Heb. 11:10,16)., 478865=1.\u00a0positively of wisdom of Daniel in 1:4,17; 9:25, 915511=8:3 \"I will return to Zion\" YHWH had left the temple in Jerusalem (cf. Ezek. 10) because of the Jews' idolatry (cf. Ezek. 8), before the city was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (cf. Ezek. 9). YHWH went to be with the Jews in exile (cf. Ezek. 1)., 917618=4.\u00a0Solomon built the temple, II Chr. 3:1, 626666=11:37 \"And he will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god\" This is difficult to understand because Antiochus IV did not reject the gods of his fathers. He worshiped Zeus., 888750=7:2, 414982=\u25a3 \"perform its will and prosper\" This refers to fallen humanity's independent attitude, which is a recurrent theme in Daniel (cf. 5:19; 8:4; 11:3,16,36)., 452429=\u25a3 \"\u2018for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem'\" Jeremiah and Daniel use two different Hebrew words for \"desolation\" (BDB 352 and 1031). The one used here in Daniel (BDB 352) is also used in connection with Jeremiah's prophecy about the exile of Jerusalem (cf. Jer. 25:9,11,18). These two terms are both used in this chapter for the destroyed and profaned temple in Jerusalem (cf. 9:2 vs. 9:17,18)., 875384=1.\u00a0Yehoshu'a, Deut. 3:21, 1005454=1.\u00a0early rain at the autumn time before spring planting (Oct. - Nov.), 259123=5:7 bring in the conjurers; the Chaldeans and the diviners\" Again the impotence of Babylon's wise men is emphasized (cf. vv. 8,15). Apparently Daniel had retired from active service (cf. v. 11)., 781593=3:1 \"he showed me\" This seems to be a vision in heaven before God similar to Job 1-2. In 1:20 it is YHWH who reveals the vision, so too, here (cf. Septuagint and Vulgate). However, many scholars see this as a reference to the interpreting angel (cf. 1:9,13,14,19; 2:2)., 1007388=The NOUN (BDB 19) basically means \"trouble,\" \"sorrow,\" or \"wickedness\" (cf. Num. 23:21; Ps. 10:7; 55:11; Isa. 10:1; 55:7). It is used in combination with Bethel in Hosea 4:15; 5:8; 10:5,8; and Amos 5:5 to label the worship of the golden calf as wilfully idolatrous (i.e. \"nothing,\" cf. Isa. 1:11-15). Possibly the classic text is I Sam. 15:22-23. It is surprising that a list of idolatrous activities is mentioned in the post-exilic period (cf. Mal. 3:5). This whole chapter may be an allusion to Moses' prophecy in Deut. 4:25-31., 64255=1:1 \"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim\" This is Babylonian dating (also used by the northern tribes, Israel) dating, while Jer. 25:1,9; 46:2 are Egyptian dating (also used by Judean scribes). Obviously Daniel was in Babylon and Jeremiah was back in Judah. Jehoiakim (609-598 b.c.) was one of Josiah's sons who was placed on the throne by Pharaoh Necco II after he exiled Jehoahaz, another son of Josiah, who reigned only three months. His name (BDB 220) means \"YHWH raises up\" or \"YHWH establishes,\" but he was an evil king (cf. II Kgs. 23:37; II Chron. 36:5; Jer. 36)., 150745=2:48 \"Daniel was promoted\" He became a governor of the province of Babylon and the head of the wise men., 1026450=10:10 \"Egypt. . .Assyria\" These were the ancient enemies of Israel used to symbolize all of the enemies of God's people., 553976=\u25a3 \"as a result of the vision\" These supernatural revelations were overwhelming (cf. 4:19; 7:15,28; 8:17,27; 10:8,9). See note at 4:19., 666365=12:10 \"Many\" See note at v. 1 (\"everyone\")., 760478=2:8 \"the Lord of hosts\" This is the most common post-exilic title for God. This refers to God as the Captain of the Army of Heaven (cf. Josh. 5:13-15) or the leader of the angelic council (cf. I Kgs. 22:19). It is first used in I Sam. 1:3. Because of Exod. 12:41 some relate it to Israel, but in contexts related to Babylon it seems to relate to God's supremacy over the astral deities. See SPECIAL TOPIC: NAMES FOR DEITY at Dan. 4:2., 699387=\u25a3 \"the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying\" When one compares Ezra 5:1; 6:14 with Zech. 1:1,7, he sees that the father of Zechariah is omitted. There have been several theories about the omission: (1) Hebrew genealogies often skip generations; (2) the early church fathers said that this refers, not to physical lineage, but to spiritual lineage (i.e. Jerome), Iddo being a tribal family group of Levites who returned to Jerusalem (cf. Neh. 12:4,16); (3) others say that for some reason Berechiah did not live up to his priestly lineage; (4) Zechariah's father had died and he was raised by his grandfather, Iddo; or (5) it refers to the faithful witness mentioned in Isa. 8:2 whose father was Je-berechiah (\"YHWH\" blesses). It is obvious that Zechariah was a prophet and a priest (cf. Jer. 1:1; Ezek. 1:1)., 421605=\u25a3 \"it looked like a man\" This is the Hebrew word gbr, (BDB 149) which makes up Gabriel's name. This has nothing to do with 7:13. Angels often appear in human form (cf. Zech. 1:8,10; 2:1,4). This does not describe their true essence, simply how they appear to us. See note at v. 13., 117636=2:9 This verse implies that Nebuchadnezzar did not trust his own wise men. This may be because (1) their interpretation had been false in the past or (2) he saw true insight by means of the four Jewish youths (cf. 1:19-20, but this seems unlikely because of v. 13b). Whatever the reason this king is about to completely eliminate the entire group of wise men through violent means (cf. vv. 12-13)., 613167=11:27 \"\u2018As for both kings, their hearts will be intent on evil'\" This is the divine understanding of the fallen human heart/mind (cf. Gen. 6:5,11-12,13; 8:21; Ps. 14:1-3; Rom. 3:9-18,23)., 265257=\u25a3 \"'one of the exiles from Judah'\" This phrase functions in two ways: (1) Belshazzar is asserting that Daniel is a captive Jewish person or (2) Daniel is a member and representative of YHWH's people; the YHWH who controls history and the destiny of kings (cf. 2:20-23; 4:17,32)!, 870993=\u25a3 \"a man\" The Messiah will be a human person (cf. Dan. 7:13). In Zechariah angels are designated as men (e.g. 1:8,10; 2:1,4), as well as the Messiah (symbolized by Joshua and Zerubbabel). God will use human instrumentality to reveal Himself, accomplish redemption, and provide an example for all other human beings., 692281=B.\u00a0Beginning in 1:7 and continuing through 6:15 is a series of eight visions and their interpretations (angelic mediators)., 758286=2:7 \"Ho\" See note at 2:6., 377680=This same phrase is used in Dan. 12:7 and Rev. 12:4. Its exact meaning is uncertain. Many assume \"time\" refers to years, however; this is not spelled out in the text. But because of related time phrases (1) Dan. 8:14, \"2300 evenings and mornings\"; (2) Dan. 12:11, \"1290 days\"; (3) Dan. 12:12, \"1335 days\"; and (4) Rev. 11:2, 13:5, \"42 months\" or \"1260 days,\" the understanding of \"years\" seems to be the best interpretation., 855701=1.\u00a0four horsemen, 1:8, 1106499=1.\u00a0Samuel, I Sam. 28:14 (different word), 111749=This Hebrew term (BDB 821, KB 952) originally meant strike or hit. It is also used of Pharaoh in Gen. 41:8, who was disturbed by his dreams (both in Niphal)., 505904=2.\u00a0metaphorically of the death of persons, Jer. 11:19; 50:16, 711707=\u25a3 \"the eleventh month\" This would be February-March, three months from the date in 1:1. Zechariah 1:7 begins a series of eight visions which continue through 6:15., 504026=2.\u00a0used of Jewish priests (e.g. Lev. 4:3,5), 358900=7:14 All things that Gentile rulers sought in power, glory, and extent of their kingdom, the God of Judahhas freely given to the Messiah. This contrast magnifies God's sovereignty, as well as His merciful character and eternal purpose in redemption through the Messiah., 308870=6:25-27 This is very similar to Nebuchadnezzar's words in chapter 2:46-48; 3:28,29 and 4:3,34-35. All of these texts were probably penned by one of the four Jewish exiles. It does not imply personal faith on the part of Darius, but the overwhelming sense of the power of God which these poly-theists experienced!, 527509=10:1 \"third year of Cyrus\" This seems to contradict 1: 21, but it means that Daniel lived during the entire exilic period and into the Persian period. Old Testament dates are not as precise as our modern dating systems., 709771=\u25a3 \"\u2018to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds'\" This may be an allusion to Lam. 2:17. Each generation must respond to the covenant. The danger of religion is that it can become a family tradition instead of a personal faith. \"The fathers\" repented, but only after God's judgment!, 643792=2.\u00a09:26 for the leader of the opposition against the Messiah, 756694=\u25a3 \"from the land of the north\" This refers to Babylon (cf. v. 7). \"The north\" (BDB 860) became an OT metaphor for trouble and invasion (cf. Isa. 14:31; Jer. 1:14-15; 4:6; 6:1,22; 10:22) because this was the only accessible land route into Palestine. Although Assyria and Babylon were to the east, the invasion route and return route were always northerly. This phrase and v. 7 warn the Jews to return to Palestine because the judgment of God is about to fall on the nations which God used to punish His people., 1016590=The term \"streets\" (BDB 299) means \"outside streets,\" which seems to refer to an open market (e.g. 9:3; 10:5; Isa. 5:25; 10:6; 15:3; 24:11; 51:20,23; Jer. 5:1;7:17,34; 37:21; Ezek. 11:6; 28:23)., 1022649=10:8 \"I will whistle for them\" This (Qal IMPERFECT COHORTATIVE) refers to a characteristic call or sound (i.e. piping) of the shepherd gathering (SECOND verb, \"GATHER\" [BDB 867, KB 1062] is a Piel IMPERFECT used as a COHORTATIVE) his sheep (cf. Jdgs. 5:16). The exact sound is uncertain (BDB 1056, KB 1656), but it is an allusion to God's gathering His scattered people (cf. Isa. 5:26; 7:18,19)., 748658=\u25a3 \"that young man\" The NET Bible (and the NIV Study Bible footnote) identifies him as a reference to Zechariah, but this does not fit the context. This seems to be \"the man\" of v. 1 (i.e. angel, cf. 1:8, 10, 11, 12), although a different Hebrew term is used (BDB 654)., 172934=\u25a3 \"brought charges against the Jews\" This is literally \"chewed up the pieces of\" (cf. 6:25). This is a very strong phrase (BDB 1080, Peal PERFECT and BDB 1111) which shows the vehemence of the charges. From the text it is obvious that there was jealousy involved because these Jewish young men had a place of leadership (cf. v. 12; 6:4). Also, there was a racial prejudice because of the mention of their origin (cf. v. 12)., 115581=2:5, 1005561=2.\u00a0latter rain at the time of the maturing plant (Mar. - April), 11872=The Spirit revealed truths to the OT writers in terms and categories they could understand. However, through progressive revelation the Spirit has expanded these OT eschatological concepts to a universal scope (\"the mystery of Christ,\" cf. Eph. 2:11-3:13. See Special Topic at Rev. 10:7). Here are some relevant examples:, 758376=\u25a3 \"Zion\" This was the name of the Canaanite stronghold located on one of the hills within the city of Jebus (cf. II Sam. 5:7), which was not captured until David's day. It is not the same hill on which the temple was built (Mt. Moriah). It is often used as a synonym for Jerusalem or as a way to accentuate the religious life of the city versus the political life of the city. It is used extensively by Isaiah, Jeremiah (also Lamentations) and Zechariah (cf. 1:14,17; 2:7,10; 8:2,3; 9:9,13)., 983552=4.\u00a0YHWH arouses His sword against His own Shepherd, 13:7, 892647=7:5 \"say to all the people of the land\" This is an idiom for the common, non-leadership (cf. Jer. 34:10; Hag. 2:4) people of God's covenant promise (i.e. Jews). For a good discussion of the way this idiom developed and changed through Israel's history see Roland deVaux, Ancient Israel: Social Institutions, vol. 1, pp. 70-72., 720476=1:10 \"the man\" From v. 11 we believe that this was the angel of the Lord. We learn from v. 10 that these men on horses were angels who were patrolling the known world (cf. 6:5-7, i.e. the ancient Near East)., 437102=The Jewish culture starts the new day at evening, following the order of Gen. 1:5,8,13,19,23,31., 768169=\u25a3 \"be glad\" This (BDB 970, KB 1333) is another Qal IMPERATIVE. It is also reflected in the Messianic passage of 9:9., 478952=2.\u00a0negatively of the craftiness of the little horn in 8:25, 577729=G.\u00a0The major truth of this chapter relates to the coming suffering of God's people. Although they look defeated by fallen, organized humanity, they are victorious through their God who is in control of all history (cf. 11:1, 12, 27, 29, 35, 36, 45)., 329436=7:4 \"the first was like a lion\" Notice the word \"like\" used here is from an Aramaic PREPOSITION. This same idea is repeated in v. 5, but with the Aramaic word demah (cf. 3:25). In v. 6 the PREPOSITION is used again. The whole point is that what Daniel saw was not real earthly animals, but similar to known animals with different physical attributes (i.e. winged lion, winged leopard). These are apocalyptic symbols of rulers and empires., 725831=\u25a3 \"these seventy years\" This seems to be an allusion to Jer. 25:11,12 and 29:10 (cf. II Chr. 36:21; Dan. 9:2), giving the specific time of the exile. There has been much discussion about this seventy year period. Is it meant to be a symbol of a large indefinite period of time, like the Hebrew term \"forty\" or is it a specific seventy year period? The two suggestions are (1) the period from 605 b.c. (Battle of Carchemish) to 539 (fall of Babylon to Cyrus) or (2) the seventy year period of time which can be found between the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in 586 b.c. to the rebuilding of the second temple in 516 b.c., which is the focus of the prophecy of both Haggai and Zechariah. This same temporal symbol is also found in Isa. 23:15,17, where it seems to refer to one life span (which may be the intended thrust of the prophecy, much like \"this generation\" of the forty year Exodus judgment)., 121576=2:13 \"the decree went forth\" It seems that the wise men were to be rounded up and killed at one public execution. This would give Daniel time to seek God., 239882=\u25a3 \"to humble those who walk in pride\" This first refers to Nebuchadnezzar (and Belshazzar, cf. 5:20), but also to all Gentile empires represented by the image of four metals in chapter 2 (cf. Exod. 18:11). This is another common biblical theme (cf. Job 40:11-12; James 4:6,10;l I Pet. 5:5-6)., 305035=6:22 \"'my God sent His angel'\" The Bible seems to teach the existence of guardian angels (national, cf. Num. 20:16; Isa. 63:9; and individual, cf. Gen. 48:16; Dan. 3:28; 6:22; Matt. 18:10; Acts 12:15; Heb. 1:14), as well as the indwelling Holy Spirit (cf. Jer. 31:31-34; John 14:23; Rom. 8:9,11; I Cor. 3:16; 6:19; II Cor. 6:16; II Tim. 1:14)., 716664=\u25a3 \"a red horse\" The term \"red\" is the Hebrew term adam (BDB 10), which means reddish brown. Colored horses are also mentioned again in the eighth vision of Zechariah in 6:1-8. They become the source of the Apostle John's Four Horses of the Apocalypse (cf. Rev. 6). Notice that there are two red horses in 1:8 and no black horses., 89065=1:17 \"God gave\" Again, like v. 9, it was not the natural talents or intelligence of these young men, but the power of God. God had a purpose for their lives., 540921=10:11, 19, 728011=1:14 Verses 14-17 are the essence of the gracious words of God mentioned in v. 13., 855760=2.\u00a0four horns/four craftsmen, 1:18,20, 273924=5:29 \"he now had authority as the third ruler in the kingdom\" These three (triumvir) would be: Nabonidus (absent), Belshazzar (co-regent), and Daniel., 369750=7:22 \"until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Highest One\" We must remember that this chapter had a word for those in exile in Babylon as well as for believers of every age who suffer persecution for their faith in YHWH and His Messiah and do not always understand why! God is in control even amidst suffering and persecution (the book of Revelation)., 1108856=\u25a3 \"Then he will say, \u2018Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends'\" He tries to explain his wounds by saying he received them while meeting with his friends (Hebrew is MASCULINE). However, the term \"friends\" or \"lovers\" (BDB 12, Piel) is used in the OT for associates in idolatry (cf. Jer. 22:20,22; 30:14; Ezek. 16:33,36,37; 23:5,9,22; Hos. 2:7,9,12,14,15; also LXX of Hos. 7:14)., 560217=10:21-11:1 Notice that NASB and NKJV have a parenthesis, which begins in 10:21 and continues through 11:1. The person speaking is the angel who touched Daniel three times (cf. 10:10-21). The context implies that it is the same majestic angel described in 10:5-9. It is this angel who provided protection to Dairus the Mede (see full note at 5:31) which, I believe, is a first-year throne name for Cyrus (cf. Isa. 44:28-45:1)., 436889=8:26 \"evenings and mornings\" This refers to the offering of a lamb in the temple each morning and evening (cf. vv. 11-14,19)., 952442=9:1, 631961=11:45 \"the seas\" This is plural and seems to refer to the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean Sea., 511497=This Niphal PARTICIPLE (BDB 358, KB 356) is different from the term \"decreed\" in 9:24 (BDB 367, KB 364, \"seal\"), but they both reflect divine sovereignty so characteristic of apocalyptic literature. God is in control of history, punishment, restoration, and the ultimate restoration of creation!, 31303=\"Unless we recognize the dramatic quality of this writing and recall the way in which language is being used as a vehicle to express religious truth, we shall grievously err in our understanding of the Apocalypse, and mistakenly try to interpret its visions as though it were a book of literal prose and concerned to describe events of empirical and datable history. To attempt the latter course is to run into all manner of problems of interpretation. More seriously it leads to a distortion of the essential meaning of apocalyptic and so misses the great value of this part of the New Testament as a dramatic assertion in mythopoetic language of the sovereignty of God in Christ and the paradox of his rule which blends might and love (cf. 5:5,6; the Lion is the Lamb)\" (p. 235)., 926595=8:11 \"the remnant\" See note at 8:6., 1009015=\u25a3 \"and tell false dreams\" The VERB (BDB 180, KB 210) is a Piel IMPERFECT. God did often speak through dreams (e.g. Jacob, Gen. 28; Joseph, Gen. 37:39-41; Dan. 1:17; 2:4,7). However, sometimes dreams were simply manipulative lies or imaginations of the human subconscious (e.g. Deut. 13:1-5; Jer. 23:32; 27:9-10; 29:8-9)., 534444=10:5 \"a certain man dressed in linen\" It is interesting that the angels in Daniel look like human males., 226432=4:25 \"until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind, and bestows it on whomever He wishes\" See full note at 4:17. This is the central and recurrent theme of Daniel (cf. Ps. 83:18; 97:9; Jer. 27:5; Rom. 9-11)., 274419=5:30 \"That same night\" From the histories of both Herodotus (1.190-191) and Xenophon (Cyropaedia 7.5) we know the date was October 12, 539 b.c., 987886=\u25a3 \"the storm winds of the south\" This could be a reference to (1) the Siniatic covenant (cf. Exod. 24); (2) God's presence as a desert storm (cf. Isa. 29:6; Ezek. 1:4; 13:11,13); or (3) \"the south\" being the antonym to \"the north,\" which was a metaphor for invasion. The south is a metaphor for salvation and deliverance (cf. Jdgs. 5:4-5; Hab. 3:3)., 469415=9:12 \"He has confirmed His word which He has spoken\" God's promises and His judgments all come true (cf. Isa. 40:8; 45:23; 46:10-11; 55:11). The trustworthiness of God's character rests on the trustworthiness of His word!, 863603=6:8, 1125554=14:1 This is a summary of the entire chapter which emphasizes God's fighting on behalf of His people. In this chapter His people are depicted as ancient Israel. God judged them and dispersed them, but now He restores their losses (cf. Isa. 53:12) and their place (i.e. Promised Land)., 463447=Fallen humanity's only hope of meeting God's standard is the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ (cf. Lev. 19:2; Matt. 5:48; II Cor. 5:21). That is why the OT is simply a school-master to lead us to Christ (cf. Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 36:22-38; Gal. 3:19-26). See SPECIAL TOPIC: RIGHTEOUSNESS at 4:27., 449826=9:1 \"in the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus of Median descent who was king over the Chaldeans\" See full note at 5:31., 467200=9:10 \"through His servants the prophets\" When we see the English word \"prophets,\" we think of Isaiah\u2014Malachi, but Judaism believed that prophets wrote Scripture, so, 553572=\u25a3 \"touching my lips\" This is a symbolic gesture of empowering to speak. It is used in the sense of a prophetic call in Isa. 6:7 and Jer. 1:9. In this context Daniel was still physically and emotionally unable to interact with the angelic messenger (cf. vv. 16-17) so the angel had to touch him again (there is even a third touch in v. 18)., 714275=10.\u00a0\"I lifted up my eyes and looked,\" 5:9, 855835=3.\u00a0four winds of heaven, 2:10, 480920=The implied agent is God. This phrase is also used of Daniel in 10:11,19. The Hebrew term (BDB 326) means \"a precious treasure\" (cf. 11:38,43)., 768357=\u25a3 \"O daughter of Zion\" This is a Semitic idiom like v. 7. This refers to the people of God. See note on \"Zion\" at 1:7., 643890=3.\u00a011:22 possibly for the priest, Onias III, who was betrayed and killed in Antiochus IV's attempt to take over the Jewish priesthood., 115331=\u25a3 \"O king, live forever\" This was a common honorific idiom for addressing Near Eastern potentates, (cf. 3:9; 5:10; 6:6,21; I Kgs. 1:31; Neh. 2:3)., 123108=\u25a3 \"Arioch\" This proper name (BDB 1082) is also found in Gen. 14:19 as the name of one of the kings who took Lot captive., 172671=3:8 \"certain Chaldeans\" It must be remembered that Chaldeans can be (1) a racial group of the southern Tigris-Euphrates River Valley (cf. 5:30) or (2) a group of wise men and priests (cf. Dan. 2:2)., 293408=\u25a3 \"live forever\" This is a standard hyperbole addressing the king (cf. 2:4; 3:9; 5:10; 6:6,21). In 4:34; 6:26; and 12:7 the phrase is used in a theological sense of YHWH, the \"I Am\" (cf. Exod. 3:14 from the Hebrew VERB \"to be\"). He is the ever-living, only-living One (cf. v 20)!, 813971=\u25a3 \"but by My Spirit\" This is an OT way of speaking of the very presence and power of God. It was often understood as the active force of God's word and will (e.g. Num. 11:17,25,29; Isa. 63:11,14; Neh. 9:20). From this developed the concept of the Spirit as God's personal agent (cf. Hag. 2:5). This was the recognition of the need for God's power and presence to overcome all of the political, spiritual, and physical barriers. Only divine action could fulfill God's promises., 40407=4.\u00a0special gift of interpreting dreams and knowledge, 1:17; 2:25-30; 4:7-9; 5:12, 14, 666483=\u25a3 \"will be purged, purified and refined\" Some will respond to God's messengers and it will radically change their lives! Persecution is a means of purging (BDB 140, KB 162, Hithpael IMPERFECT, \"to separate from dross\" [i.e. evil])and sanctification (BDB 864, kb 1057, Niphal IMPERFECT, \"to separate from dross\" [i.e. \"to God\"] cf. 11:35; Mal. 3:2-3)., 439047=8:27, 1056203=\u25a3 \"the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized it was the word of the Lord\" The \"afflicted of the flock\" refers to the sheep merchants (cf. NRSV, TEV, NJB). See full note at 11:7. The good shepherd's actions were recognized as being directed by YHWH. God was actively involved in this process of judging:, 811779=4:3 \"two olive trees\" The lamps burned olive oil, so these are symbolically the two sources of YHWH's abundant illumination, power, and provision (cf. vv. 11-14). These same two symbols, the lamp and olive tree, are also used in Rev. 11:3-4., 872990=\u25a3 \"He will build the temple\" This seems to refer to Zerubbabel historically (cf. 4:9), but to Jesus eschatologically. The temple that Jesus will build seems to be spiritual (cf. John 2:19-21), although some see it as the temple of Ezekiel 38-40. The book of the Revelation speaks of a heavenly temple (cf. 3:12; 7:15; 11:1-2,19; 14:15,17; 15:5,6,8; 16:1,17). However, when New Jerusalem comes down out of heaven (cf. Rev. 21:22), there is no temple mentioned. The book of Hebrews speaks of a heavenly tabernacle into which Jesus entered once and for all to offer Himself as a sacrifice to God on our behalf (cf. Heb. 8-10), but it is not mentioned anywhere else in Scripture, although the detailed plans of Exod. 25-27 seem to imply a heavenly original., 609264=11:21 \"a despicable person will arise\" This Hebrew VERB's (BDB 102, KB 117) basic meaning is \"despised with contempt.\" In the Niphal form it is used in Ps. 15:4; 119:141; Isa. 53:3; Jer. 22:28; Mal. 1:7. The Arabic cognate means \"to raise the head loftily or disdainfully.\" This refers to Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-163 b.c.)., 789831=\u25a3 \"See\" This is a Qal IMPERATIVE (BDB 906, KB 1157). This is a form of the same term used in 1:8,18; 2:1,9 to denote a new vision, but here the IMPERATIVE is used for emphasis. Joshua has been forgiven, recommissioned, and fully restored as priest and cultic supervisor! This new temple will be staffed!, 1041468=3.\u00a0panels for the hall, II Chr. 3:5, 754397=2:6, 735233=\u25a3 \"four horns\" Horns are symbolic of (1) power or (2) nations (cf. Jer. 48:25; Ezek. 48:25; Amos 6:13; and Dan. 8:3). The number four seems to be the number of the world (i.e. four horses of 1:8 and the four winds of 2:10). Some say that this refers to the kingdoms of Daniel, chapters 2 and 7 (Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome), but I believe that, in context, understanding world kingdoms that affect the Promised Land would be more appropriate., 553474=d.\u00a0ish, 12:6,7, 649348=This Hebrew term (BDB 572, KB 589, Niphil IMPERFECT) is also used in 11:41. It denotes physical deliverance (cf. 11:41), but like its NT counterpart, it has the connotation in some contexts of spiritual salvation (cf. 12:1)., 974281=\u25a3 \"Humble\" This word (BDB 776) is used in several ways in Zechariah: (1) in the sense of \"afflicted\" (cf. 11:7,11; Isa. 14:32; 49:13; 51:21; 54:11) or \"poor\" (cf. 7:10; Isa. 3:14-15; 10:30; 11:4; 32:7; 41:17; 58:7; 61:1). \"Afflicted\" describes the Suffering Servant of Isa. 53, although vv. 2 and 3 use a different term. Isaiah 53:7 uses the same root (BDB 776 III) or (2) here it is the sense of \"lowly\" or \"meek\" (e.g. Prov. 16:19)., 84858=1:9 \"God granted\" This verse, like v. 17, shows God's presence and purpose in the situation. God was with them and would use them for His purposes., 291525=6:4 \"trying to find grounds of accusation against Daniel in regard to government affairs\" The same motives that led the Chaldean officials to accuse the three Hebrew youths in Daniel 3 are apparently the same motives that caused these officials to try and find accusations against Daniel (cf. v. 13)., 479048=3.\u00a0negatively of unfaithful Israel in 9:13, 965495=There is confusion of whether this Hiphil VERB is \"be ashamed\" (BDB 101, KB 116, cf. 10:5) or \"be dried up\" (BDB 386). The second one is found in Zechariah in 10:11 (Hiphil) and 11:17 (Qal). However, Joel, which I think is early post-exilic, also has four places where these same two roots are confused (Joel 1:10,12[twice] and 17)., 844405=The same VERB (BDB 1020, KB 1527, Hiphil IMPERFECT) is used to describe how the angel handled both the woman and the lead weight., 119763=2:12 \"the king became indignant and very furious\" The king's response to their alibi was extreme anger (BDB 1084). The second term, \"very furious\" (BDB 1111) is used of YHWH's wrath. He ordered that all the wise men of Babylon be killed. The term \"Babylon\" can refer (1) to the city; (2) the province; or (3) the whole empire., 661576=\u25a3 \"How long will it be until the end of these wonders\" This is exactly the same question the angelic being asked in 8:13. The word \"wonders\" (BDB 810) could have a negative connotation here (cf. v. 7) and a positive one later (cf. vv. 1-3)., 822394=1.\u00a0for God's blessing, here and II Chr. 16:9, 903820=See SPECIAL TOPIC: THE TRINITY at 4:6., 647220=This will seem confusing, but (1) the Hebrew term (BDB 912 I) for \"many\" means \"all\" in Deut. 7:1; Isa. 52:14,15; (2) Isa. 53:11,12 compare with 53:6 as well as the parallelism of Rom. 5:18-19; (3) this same concept of \"many\" being used for \"all\" can be found in Matt. 20:28; and 26:28; (4) Jesus seems to allude to Dan. 12:2 and changes \"many\" to \"all\" in John 5:28-29. The Hebrew term for \"all\" is parallel to \"many\" in Isa. 2:2. This same confusion of \"all\" versus \"many\" has sometimes degenerated into denominational conflict between Calvinists and Armenians. There is enough fluidity in the Scriptures that we cannot be dogmatic in this area. Compare Rom. 5:15, 16 with 5:12., 205063=This seems to be an allusion to the up-coming dream of a glorious tree. This type of human arrogance is prophesied in Isa. 47:7,8. Isaiah 13-14 and 46-47 are oracles of judgment against Babylon, which becomes the biblical symbol of human arrogance and pride., 921760=\u25a3 \"east. . .west\" These compass directions are used in the universal sense as in Ps. 50:1; 113:3; Isa. 59:19; Mal. 1:11., 855902=4.\u00a0four chariots, 6:1, 371872=7:23 The NKJV, NRSV, and NJB print verses 23-27 as poetry, but the NASB and TEV treat it as prose. This same problem is also found in vv. 9-10, 13-14. It is difficult to know if these verses are poetic or elevated prose., 12239=1.The city of Jerusalem in the OT is used as a metaphor for the people of God (Zion), but is projected into the NT as a term expressing God's acceptance of all repentant, believing humans (the new Jerusalem of Revelation 21-22). The theological expansion of a literal, physical city into the new people of God (believing Jews and Gentiles) is foreshadowed in God's promise to redeem fallen mankind in Gen. 3:15 before there even were any Jews or a Jewish capital city. Even Abraham's call (cf. Gen. 12:1-3) involved the Gentiles (cf. Gen. 12:3; Exod. 19:5)., 1024214=10:9 \"I scatter them\" This context emphasizes the sovereignty of YHWH over history and redemption (cf. vv. 3,6,9,10). God acts in blessing and cursing (cf. Deut. 27-29) based on His people's obedience to the Mosaic covenant. But even amidst disobedience, He still acts in faithfulness to His own character and purpose (cf. Jer. 31:27-28)., 926695=8:12 This reflects the covenant blessings of Deut. 27-29 (cf. Hag. 2:19)., 1020829=\u25a3 \"For I am the Lord their God, and I will answer them\" These covenant terms emphasize the restoration of the covenant relationship. Answered prayer (BDB 772 I, KB 851, Qal IMPERFECT) is one of the benefits. The broken covenant is illustrated in 7:13., 86762=1:10 \"forfeit my head to the king\" This shows the power of the king and the fear of his servants over even minor problems., 932420=8:17 The first two negated VERBS are Qal IMPERFECTS used in a JUSSIVE sense. God hates premeditated schemes!, 1041409=2.\u00a0doors, I Kgs. 6:34, 423583=\u25a3 \"the vision pertains to the time of the end\" This vision seems to refer not to the far future, but the relatively near future (i.e. Empires of Persia and Greece). This should give modern interpreters a warning about trying to define the phrase \"the time of the end\" (cf. v. 19) as always eschatological. In 11:40 \"the end time\" is used of the period of Greek rule involving the kingdoms of the Ptolomies and Seleucids (323-165 b.c.)., 746841=\u25a3 \"a man\" This apparently refers to an angelic being (cf. 1:8,10 compared to 1:11,12). Angelic beings often appear as male humans (only once in Zech. 5:9 are they depicted as female)., 339372=7:8 \"another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by its roots before it\" The little horn of Dan. 7 may be the Anti-Christ of the end-time because it comes from the fourth kingdom (cf. H. C. Leopold, Exposition of Daniel, pp. 322-323 and E. J Young, The Prophecy of Daniel, p. 150). This is somewhat confusing because the little horn of 8:9-14 seems to refer to the Seleucid ruler, Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164 b.c.) who comes from the third kingdom during the Maccabean Period. He is a type of anti-christ which is always among us (cf. I John 2:18)., 783730=As an interpreter my problem in this text is not that \"the angel of the Lord\" is identified as divine in the OT (cf. Gen. 16:7-13; 22:11-15; 31:11,13; 48:15-16; Ex. 3:2-4; 13:21; 14:19; Jdgs. 2:1; 6:22-24; 13:3-22), but that in chapter 1 the title is used of an angel who is patrolling the earth for YHWH (cf. v. 11) and prays to YHWH (cf. v. 13, i.e. separate from deity, cf Gen. 24:7,40; Ex. 23:20-23; 32:35; Num. 22:22; Jdgs. 5:23; II Sam. 24:16; I Chr. 21:15-30). This does not fit the exalted place of the Messiah. Also in chapter 1 many try to make \"me\" of vv. 8, 9, and 11 refer to the Messiah, when I think it refers to the prophet Zechariah. To put it bluntly interpreters are trying to find the Trinity too much in this ambiguous apocalyptic book (as some do in trying to identify Michael with the Messiah in Daniel). Specificity is not the hallmark of Zechariah's visions! Be careful of (1) dogmatism; (2) reading a tight systematic theological grid into these texts; or (3) allowing personal preference to dictate one and only one possibility., 538356=10:7 \"while the men who were with me did not see the vision\" Daniel, along with other Persian officials, was on a government mission (cf. 8:27). This sounds very much like Paul's description of Jesus' appearances to him in Acts, chapters 9, 22, 26. This vision was for only one!, 40343=3.\u00a0highly intelligent, 1:4, 1106846=13:5 \"I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground\" This man will claim to be a farmer, not a prophet., 127338=\u25a3 \"the God of heaven\" Some see this as a common title for the high god in both Babylon and Persia. However, it is possible that it was used by the Jews to show the supremacy of YHWH (cf. Gen. 24:7; Ezra 1:2; 6:10; 7:12, 21: Neh. 1:5; 2:4). The exiled Jews often took the common title for the high god of their captors and applied it to YHWH. See SPECIAL TOPIC: NAMES FOR DEITY at Dan. 4:2., 397515=8:2 \"I was in the citadel of Susa\" Susa later became the capitol of the kingdom of Persia (cf. Neh. 1:1); but at this time it was simply a large, fortified city in the province of Elam (i.e. east of the Tigris River, cf. Isa. 21:6; Jer. 49:34-39). It would later be called Shushan (cf. Neh. 1:1; Esther 1:2,5). The Greek name was Susa., 430544=8:22 \"although not with his power\" None of the rival Greek generals (satraps) ever equaled the power and extent of Alexander's kingdom!, 88716=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:1:17 \u00a017As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in every branch of literature and wisdom; Daniel even understood all kinds of visions and dreams., 707711=1:6 \"My words and My statutes\" God's revealed truths and covenant requirements are called by many terms, as Ps. 19:7-9 clearly shows., 133413=2:28 \"He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days\" Nebuchadnezzar is used in a symbolic way to represent human government (cf. verses 36-38). This same type of metaphor is found in Rev. 18 in the phrase \"the whore of Babylon.\" Daniel, chapters 1 through 6, describes human governments, while chapters 7 through 12 discuss the coming of the kingdom of God., 326540=7:2 \"the four winds of heaven\" Four is the biblical symbolic number for the world (i.e. the four corners of the earth, cf. Dan. 8:8; 11:4; Zech. 2:6; 6:5). This has been interpreted as (1) universal divine knowledge (cf. Zech. 1:8-11; 6:1-8); (2) a gathering of angels (cf. Isa. 11:12; Matt. 13:41; 24:31; Mark 13:27); or (3) destroying angels (cf. Jer. 49:36; Zech. 2:6; Rev. 7:1; 9:14-15). This and similar phrases are a metaphor for God's activity in the world (where \"four\" is combined with \"winds,\" \"corners,\" \"angels\"). God knows and allows/controls all activity on planet earth (apocalyptic theology)., 1086708=12:10 \"I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication\" The phrase \"I will pour out\" (BDB 1049, KB 1629, Qal PERFECT) is used quite often in the OT to denote God giving the Spirit (cf. Ezek. 39:29; Joel 2:28,29, a different word but same concept in Isa. 12:15; 44:3). The terms \"grace\" (BDB 336, cf. 4:7) and \"supplication\" (BDB 337, cf. Jer. 31:9) are from the same root. This is a strong verse which emphasizes the national conversion of Israel to faith in God's crucified (\"pierced\") Messiah (cf. Rom. 11:25-27; John 19:37; Rev. 1:7). The physical deliverance of vv. 2-9 are not complete without the spiritual deliverance of v. 10!, 479128=4.\u00a0positively of restored Israel in 11:33,35, 1069367=A.\u00a0There is a parallel relationship between chapters 9-11 and 12-14, which can be seen in the use of \"burden,\" 9:1 and 12:1 (see Baldwin, Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries, p. 187 and H. C. Leupold, Exposition of Zechariah, p. 223). Chapters 12-14 form a literary unit., 428137=\u25a3 \"for it pertains to the appointed time of the end\" This phrase (BDB 417) is found here and in 11:27,29,35, which all refer to events relating to Greece, especially Antiochus IV, who aggressively attacks God's people., 641591=12:1 \"Now at that time\"\u00a0The Septuagint begins this chapter with \"unto that place.\" It is obvious that 12:1-4 are connected with the message of chapter 11. The time of 12:1 links up with the events of 11:40-45. The real issue is the time frame. The use of \"the king of the South\" (11:40) and \"the king of the North\" (11:40) implies that it refers to the second century b.c. However, the use of \"at the end-time\" (11: 40) could imply a future period (cf. 12:4,9), but not necessarily because a similar phrase is used in vv. 27 and 35. The only reason that a second century context is questioned is because of the accuracy of 11:2-35 and the possible accuracy of 11:36-39 and the total inaccuracy (based on known secular history) of 11:40-45., 343165=Verses 13 and 14 are one of the greatest Messianic texts in the OT. One like a Son of Man is coming, riding on the clouds of heaven and the Ancient of Days gives Him the eternal kingdom (cf. 2:44; 4:3,34; 6:26; 7:14,27), but this involves a period of suffering and persecution of God's people. There is no victory without suffering (cf. Gen. 3:15; Ps. 22; Isa. 53; Zech. 12-14; Rom. 8:17,18-25; Phil. 3:10; II Tim. 2:11-13; I Pet. 4:13). Evil brings pain and suffering, but God transforms it into the path of growth and maturity (cf. Heb. 5:8)., 937269=8:22 \"so many peoples and mighty nations will come\" The Hebrew ADJECTIVE \"mighty\" (BDB 783) can mean \"numerous\" (cf. Ps. 35:18; Prov. 7:26; Isa. 53:12; Amos 5:12). If so, then \"many peoples\" is parallel to \"numerous nations.\", 509455=1.\u00a0the virgin birth, Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:23 (historical birth in Isaiah's day, cf. 7:15-16, as well as the virgin birth of Jesus, cf. LXX quote in Matt. 1:23), 146027=2:43, 170263=\u25a3 \"Fall down and worship\" Both VERBS are Peal IMPERFECT (BDB 1103 and 1104). This shows the religious and political significance of this object (cf. v. 12). This is the reason that the three Hebrew children refused to participate. It is uncertain if the Neo-Babylonian rulers claimed deity (the image as a representative of Nebuchadnezzar, cf. 2:38), as did the Pharaohs of Egypt and some later Caesars of Rome., 855961=5.\u00a0four spirits (or \"winds,\" like 2:10) of heaven, 6:5, 913793=8:1 This phrase introduces a new stage of the discussion beginning in 7:1 and 8., 309237=6:25 \"all the peoples, nations, and men of every language\" This is parallel to Nebuchadnezzar's edicts in 3:29; 4:1 and Daniel's comment in 5:19 and his vision in 7:14., 603161=\u25a3 \"he will stay for a time in the Beautiful Land\" This refers to Antiochus III the Great who was welcomed into Jerusalem as a liberator from the Egyptian domination in 198 B.C. \"The Beautiful Land\" refers to the Promised Land (cf. 8:9)., 287512=6:1 \"one hundred and twenty satraps over the kingdom\" When compared with later Persian documents the number of these satraps is inappropriately large. In Persia there were usually only 20 to 30, but in the book of Esther there is also a large number (compare 1:1 with 8:9) of governmental officials., 714412=11.\u00a0\"I lifted up my eyes again and looked,\" 6:1, 785711=3:2 \"the Lord. . .the Lord\" The first seems to refer to the angel of the Lord mentioned in v. 1 (NET, NJB, TEV, NAB, JPSOA)., 259377=\u25a3 \"purple\" The King James Version has \"scarlet\" and we must remember that the names of ancient colors varied greatly. Purple was the color of royalty (cf. Xenophon, Anabasis 1:5,8). Scarlet was very expensive cloth worn only by the very wealthy., 300423=6:16, 263599=\u25a3 \"appointed him chief of the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans and diviners\" See note at 1:20; 2:48, and 4:9., 381810=\u25a3 \"and all the dominions will serve and obey Him\" This term \"dominion,\" \"have power,\" or \"sovereignty\" (BDB 1115) is used in Daniel for (1) God (cf. 4:3,34; 6:26) or (2) the Gentile kingdoms (cf. 4:22; 6:26; 7:6,12,26). It is used of the \"Son of Man\" in 7:14, which may reflect Gen. 1:26,28-30, where Adam (and thereby mankind) is given authority or dominion over this planet. One wonders if the phrase \"all the dominions\" refers to (1) the PLURAL \"kingdoms\" in v. 27; (2) the believers of the OT and NT (cf. Isa. 45:20-25); or (3) possibly angelic realms (cf. Heb. 1:13-14; Dan. 7:10). This concept of complete cosmic allegiance may be expressed in Phil. 2:10-11 and Col. 1:16-20 or even I Cor. 15:24-25!, 787755=Jacobus Nande, in his article in the New International Dictionary of Old Testament Theology and Exegesis, vol. 1, p. 304, says, \"the figure in Amos 4:11 and Zech. 3:2 suggests that Israel as a nation had been rescued from the furnace of Babylon to become a torch to enlighten the nations.\" This redemptive world-wide purpose for the Jews must be seen as the essence of God's having a chosen people (cf. Gen. 12:3; Exod. 19:5)., 113934=2:4 \"in Aramaic\" At this point the text of Daniel changes from Hebrew to Aramaic and will continue through chapter 7. Aramaic was the governmental and commercial language from the Assyrian to the Persian Empires. At this point in the text Daniel begins to quote Nebuchadnezzar's fearful command of judgment on the Chaldean wise men. Therefore, a change to Aramaic fits., 720748=1:11 \"they answered the angel of the Lord\" The phrase \"the angel of the Lord\" is often used in the OT for a powerful angel (cf. Gen. 24:7,40; Exod. 32:34; Num. 22:22; Jdgs. 5:23; II Sam. 24:16; I Chr. 21:15-16; Zech. 1:12-13). However, in other contexts it seems to refer to God Himself (cf. Gen. 16:7-13; 18:2,22; 22:11-15; 31:11,13; 48:15-16; Exod. 3:2-6; 13:21; 14:9; 20:20-23; Jdgs. 2:1; 6:14,22; 13:9-18,22; Zech. 3:1-2). Many have asserted that these passages refer to the pre-Incarnate Jesus. It is obvious from v. 12 that the angel of the Lord is separate from the Lord of hosts. In v. 12 the angel prays an intercessory prayer to the Lord of hosts on behalf of the Jewish people (also note v. 10)., 1106729=4.\u00a0John the Baptist, Matt. 3:4; Mark 1:6, 1104098=\u25a3 \"and the unclean spirit from the land\" The presence of the DEFINITE ARTICLE could mean that we are identifying a particular figure (i.e. Satan, cf. I Kgs. 22:21) or this is a hendiadys, which means \"the prophets\" and \"the unclean spirit\" form one group (i.e. false prophets). This same phrase is also used quite often in the NT to refer to the demonic. It (i.e. Leupold, p. 246, \"spirit of uncleanness\") is obvious that this is the exact opposite of \"the spirit of grace\" mentioned in 12:10., 624186=11:36 \"the king\" In context \"the king\" seems to refer to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, but because (1) it does not fit into our current understanding of history; (2) \"the end-time\" is mentioned in v. 40; and (3) it is so similar to the description of the Antichrist in II Thess. 2:4, vv. 36-45 could describe the Antichrist of the end-time, as does the little horn of Dan. 7 and 9:24-27., 183476=3:27 In the presence of all his civil, military, and police officials Nebuchadnezzar is forced to acknowledge the God of Judah (cf. vv. 28-29) for the second time., 857695=6:2 \"red horses\" The color red (BDB 10) is probably reddish brown when it refers to animals., 1131127=\u25a3 \"the Lord. . .will come and all the holy ones\" This refers to YHWH's coming with angels (cf. Deut. 33:2-3). Angels are called holy ones in Job 5:1; 15:5; Ps. 89:5,7; Dan. 8:13. The term \"holy\" is also used of believers in the OT (cf. Ps. 16:3; 34:9; Isa. 4:3; Dan. 7:18,21,22,25,27; 8:24). In the NT it refers to Jesus' Second Coming and may include angels and believers (cf. Matt. 16:27; 25:31; Mark 8:38; II Thess. 1:7; Rev. 19:14)., 630660=11:41 \"Edom, Moab. . .Ammon\" These involve the enemies of Israel which surrounded them in a more ancient time. Even in the Macabbean period Moab had passed from the scene forever. This shows that verse 41 must be taken symbolically to refer to local enemies of God's people., 408164=8:9 \"a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east and toward the Beautiful land\" This refers to the fourth Seleucid ruler known as Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164 b.c.). We learn from history that he gained, through craftiness (cf. v. 24), a rather extensive kingdom and was especially a problem to the Jewish people of Palestine (i.e. \"the beautiful land,\" cf. 11:16,41)., 835740=\u25a3 \"twenty cubits. . .ten cubits\" A cubit (BDB 52) is equal to the length from a man's elbow to his longest finger. It was about eighteen inches. The size of this scroll is unusually large, ten yards by 5 yards. Some commentators see it related to the dimensions of \"the Holy Porch\" of I Kgs. 6:3, which was the place of religious teaching and judicial administration (cf. I Kgs. 7:67), but here it just seems to denote a readable message. Remember this is apocalyptic imagery!, 543071=This same Hebrew word is used in the Psalms to assert that God cares for and hears the humble (cf. Ps. 10:16-17; 69:32) and the afflicted (cf. Ps. 9:11-16; 10:12-15). The NT continues this theme about God's special care and rescue of the humble-minded in Matt. 18:4; 23:12; Luke 18:14; James 4:10; I Pet. 5:6., 612953=11:26 \"those who eat his choice food will destroy him\" This seems to refer to the political intrigue occurring in the Egyptian court (cf. vv. 25-27)., 1088564=\u25a3 \"so that they will look on Me\" The VERB (BDB 613, KB 661) is a Hiphil PERFECT. The Hebrew PREPOSITION translated \"on\" (BDB 39) in this verse should really be translated as \"to\" or \"unto\" (see New International Dictionary of Old Testament Theology and Exegesis, vol. 3, p. 9 and The Expositor's Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 683). It speaks of looking to this one for help or grace (cf. Num. 21:9; Isa. 45:22 for this usage of the PREPOSITION)., 956827=\u25a3 \"Hamath\" This is a city in the northern part of the Promised Land, which is mentioned in II Kgs. 14:28. It is often depicted as the northern-most limit of God's geographical covenant with Abraham (cf. Num. 13:21; 34:1-12; Josh. 13:5; Jdgs. 3:3)., 932591=\u25a3 \"all these are what I hate\" Both \"hate\" (BDB 971, KB 1338, Qal PERFECT, cf. Prov. 6:16-19) and \"love\" (BDB 12, Qal IMPERFECT and Qal IMPERATIVE, v. 19) are human emotions applied to God (anthropomorphism). God is surely personal and thereby has feelings and emotions, but His holy, gracious, unchanging character controls the mood swings experienced by fallen humans. These words are analogous, not definitive!, 40248=2.\u00a0from an important and wealthy family in Jerusalem, 1:3, 822476=2.\u00a0for those seeking God, Amos 8:12 and possibly Dan. 12:4, 878912=\u25a3 \"it will take place if you completely obey the Lord your God\" Notice that there is a conditional element in these promises (cf. 3:7). This is a quote from Deut. 28:1 (Deut. 27-29 contains the Covenant Cursing and Blessing Litany)., 987685=Notice in this context it is YHWH who blows (i.e. \"sounds,\" BDB 1075, Qal IMPERFECT) the trumpet (cf. Isa. 27:13; Matt. 24:31; I Cor. 15:52; I Thess. 4:16; Rev. 11:15)., 177067=3:17 \"if it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire\" Nebuchadnezzar II had made this a contest between the gods of Babylon and the God of Judah by asserting that no one could deliver them out of his hand (cf. v. 15). The descriptive title, \"the God who is able,\" is also in v. 29 and in the NT at Rom. 16:5; Eph. 3:20; Jude 24., 867468=6:10, 300505=NASB, NKJV\"Your God. . .will Himself\" NRSV, NASB margin, NAB\"May your God. . .deliver you\" TEV\"May your God. . .rescue you\" NJB\"Your God. . .will have to save you\", 249516=For a good brief discussion of neo-Babylon see Jack Finegan, Archaeological History of the Ancient Middle East, Westview Press, 1979, pp. 123-133., 540407=10:10 \"a hand touched me\" Angels did this (Qal PERFECT) to encourage and strengthen those to whom they appeared (cf. vv. 16, 18; I Kgs 19:5-7; as did Jesus. Rev.1:17)., 703391=It is theologically significant that Zechariah calls for a repentant response on the part of the people of God. The visions of 1:8-6:15 then proclaim God's sovereign acts on behalf of His people. Notice the balance\u2015God's sovereign initiative demands a human response., 991576=\u25a3 \"as the stones of a crown\" This may be (1) a contrast to the sling stones mentioned in v. 15; (2) an allusion to Isa. 62:3, the precious stones used to describe God's people; or (3) an allusion to the coronation of the new king (the Messiah as YHWH's representative), 473206=9:16 \"in accordance with all Thy righteous acts\" In v. 7 Daniel attributes righteousness to God; in v. 14 Daniel elicits the covenant claim, \"the Lord our God is righteous\"; and now in v. 16 Daniel appeals to the character of God (cf. vv. 17,19), not the disobedience of His people (cf. v. 18), as the reason to restore Israel (cf. v. 20), so as to complete their calling of being a light to the nations!, 450041=The real problem in this verse versus 5:31 is the addition of the father's name, Ahasuerus. This name appears in the OT in Ezra 4:6 and Esther 1:1 as Esther's Persian husband, known by his Greek name, Xerxes. The name, like Darius, might be an honorific title (i.e. \"mighty man\" or \"mighty eye,\" cf. BDB 31). As of this point in time scholarship knows nothing of this Chaldean ruler of Median descent. As has happened so often already, archaeology has shed light on other perceived historical difficulties (i.e. Belshazzar). So, let us keep searching!, 144026=2:39 \"after you there will arise another kingdom\" Apparently this was to ease Nebuchadnezzar's fear that his kingdom might be taken from him soon., 479210=5.\u00a0positively of believers of the end-time period in 12:3,10, 1018546=\u25a3 \"I shall bring them back\" This word (BDB 996, KB 1427, Hiphil PERFECT) is a combination of (BDB 998), \"bring them back\" (NASB, NKJV, NRSV, TEV, NJB, cf. 10:10) and \"make them dwell\" (BDB 442, cf. NASB footnote and v. 4), which is the translation of the Septuagint. Many rabbis assert that the form is definitely ambiguous so as to emphasize both elements (i.e. repentance and permanent residence in the Promised Land)., 1100265=\u25a3 \"for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem\" The royal line and the people who returned from exile are the recipients (cf. 12:10). Notice there is no distinction between Jerusalem and Judah, as in 12:2,5,7., 527984=In v. 13 \"an angelic prince of Persia\" is identified with \"the kings of Persia.\" This is a corporate understanding of a national entity or a guardian advocate of an angelic realm. It is so hard to know in Daniel what is literal and historical and what is apocalyptic and just supplied for impact! Since this is the only place (except Deut. 32:8 in the LXX) where national angels are mentioned I think it best to yield to the genre and maintain its symbolic nature., 55836=Copyright \u00a9 2012 Bible Lessons International, 629865=11:40 \"at the end time\" See note at 8:19., 937622=As other Jews come so now the initial purpose of God is fulfilled when \"many peoples and mighty nations\" come to Him. This universal aspect in Zechariah (cf. 2:11) is surprising in light of (1) Zech. 1:15,21; (2) the racial tone of Haggai; and (3) the problems faced by Nehemiah (cf. Neh. 4:6). Zechariah is looking beyond the immediate (cf. Isa. 2:2-4; 56:7; 66:18-24; Micah 4:1-3). He is looking to the days of \"the wounded shepherd\" (cf. chapters 12-13)!, 543418=10:13, 20 \"prince of the kingdom of Persia\" This is a different Hebrew word than \"prince\" of 9:25-26 (BDB 617). This is the Hebrew term (BDB 978) which is translated \"chieftain,\" \"ruler,\" \"official,\" \"captain,\" or \"prince\" and usually in the Bible refers to different kinds of leaders. It is often used in late Hebrew for angels (cf. v. 21; 12:1; Josh. 5:14,15)., 123885=This Aramaic word is used only here and in 3:22. Its basic meaning is \"harshness\" (BDB 1093), but it can mean suddenly or urgently (Davidson, Analytical Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon, p. 272)., 868428=\u25a3 This refers to the returning Jewish Levites and priests from Babylon coming with a gift from the Persian court to help rebuild the temple (cf. Ezra 7:13-16; 8:24-30). They are told to go immediately to Josiah's house (another priest, cf. Jer. 29:25,29), who was possibly their host., 559072=This is the same Hebrew term (BDB 304, KB 302) which basically means \"to be firm,\" \"to grow firm,\" or \"to be strong.\" In 10:21 it is in the Hithpael form and in 11:1 it is in the Hiphil form. Angels serve rulers and nations (cf. 10:13,20,21). As Michael served, protected, and encouraged Israel, this angel did the same for Darius the Mede, so as to fulfill God's will in history and in redemption., 983269=1.\u00a0YHWH is aroused from His holy habitation, 2:13, 1073630=\u25a3 \"forms the spirit of man within him\" The Hebrew term \"spirit\" (BDB 924-926) can mean \"breath,\" \"wind,\" or \"spirit.\" In Gen. 2:7 God's breath turned a clay-formed man into a living being (Nephesh). The \"wind\" of God (cf. Gen. 8:1, re-creation after the flood) and the \"Spirit\" of God (cf. Gen. 1:2, initial creation) are active forces of YHWH Elohim in Genesis. The unseen God is active initially and continually in creation. The physical material aspect of creation is only part of the wonder and scope of God's creative activities., 654041=\u25a3 \"will shine brightly\" There is a word play between \"shine\" (BDB 263) and \"those who lead the many to righteousness\" (cf. Isa. 53:11), based on the parallel of the actions of those in 11:33. The concept of illumination (i.e. light and teaching) links \"shine\" and \"giving understanding.\" Those who know God share Him with others!, 365601=2.\u00a0\"forever, for all the ages to come,\" 7:18, 645303=6.\u00a0rise from the dead, 12:13, 913928=8:2 \"the Lord of hosts\" This was a common post-exilic title. See Special Topic: The Names for Deity at Dan. 4:2., 325659=b.\u00a0head of image, Dan. 2:32,38, 1104696=13:3 \"And it will come about that if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother\" A tremendous change of attitude has occurred where even parents are ready to discipline their children for idol worship., 129640=2:20 \"the name of God\" This phrase stands for the character of God. Verses 20-23 have been called Daniel's prayer of praise or the Song of Daniel., 714008=8.\u00a0\"I lifted up my eyes and looked,\" 5:1, 553297=a.\u00a0Adam, 8:16, 768589=\u25a3 \"dwell\" This (BDB 1014, KB 1496, Qal PERFECT) is the same root as Shekinah (cf. v. 11). The greatest blessing of the Covenant was the presence of the Lord with His people (cf. 8:3; 9:9; Ezek. 37:27). The concept is expressed in the Messianic title \"Emmanuel,\" which means \"God with us\" (cf. Isa. 7:14; 8:8)., 1061908=This Hebrew ADJECTIVE (BDB 17) is used often in Proverbs of someone who despises wisdom (i.e. a fool). It is used of prophets in Ezek. 13:3,10 and Hosea 9:7 and of God's people in Jer. 4:22., 438304=\u25a3 \"but keep the vision secret\" This secrecy is seen in 7:28 and 12:4,9. This is literally, \"stop us\" or \"shut up\" (BDB 711, KB 771, Qal IMPERATIVE, cf. II Kgs. 3:19; II Chr. 32:4,30; the PASSIVE in Dan. 12:9). This means that the phrase may mean to conserve the vision, not keep it secret!, 120863=3.\u00a02:14, \"with discretion and discernment\", 1127996=14:4 \"And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives\" The PRONOUN anthropomorphically reflects YHWH (cf. \"LORD\" of vv. 1,3,5 and PRONOUN of v. 2a). However, the Messiah often takes on the titles and functions of the Father. In context, this chapter is oriented toward God the Father., 1015753=\u25a3 \"ruler\" This is literally \"oppressor.\" This is the very same Hebrew word (BDB 620) which is used in 9:8 in a negative sense. However, it seems to be used in a positive sense here (cf. Isa. 60:17) for the administrative or military leaders at the inauguration of the reign of the coming Messiah., 595418=11:6 \"and the daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North\" This was an attempt to stop the tension between these two dynasties by marriage (252 b.c.). However, the king of the North, Antiochus II Theos (261-246 b.c.), was already married to a lady named Laodice and they had two sons, Seleucus II Callinicus and Antiochus III. This lady was divorced and the daughter of Ptolemy II, Philadelphus (285-246 b.c.), was made the bride of Antiochus II. Her name was Bernice. However, when her father, Ptolemy II, died, Bernice was rejected for Laodice. Laodice, fearful of her position, poisoned her husband, Antiochus II, and had her son (Seleucus II Callinicus) put on the throne. She also killed Bernice and her child and her servants., 1071668=12:1 \"The burden of the word\" It seems that Zech. 9:1 and 12:1 introduce a parallel section in this closing section of the book of Zechariah. See note on \"burden\" at 9:1., 797799=This title is used of Zerubbabel in 6:12 as a symbol of the royal Davidic line. It is surprising that it is used in this context which emphasizes the priestly aspect of the Messiah. The twin aspects of redeemer (priestly, cf. Isaiah 53) and administrative leader (kingly, cf. Isa. 9:6-7) are merged in the book of Zechariah (cf. chapter 4)., 372676=\u25a3 \"will devour the whole earth\" The VERB (BDB 1080) is a Peal IMPERFECT. See 4:1 for the use of this same hyperbole, which refers to the known world., 663774=\u25a3 \"they finished shattering the power of the holy people\" Does this refer to (1) some kind of persecution of the Jewish people (cf. 7:21,25; 8:23-26; 9:24-27; 11:36-45) or (2) of the Christian church (cf. Matt. 24; Mark 13; Luke 21; II Thess; Revelation)? There is a third option that goes back to 11:14, 34, which may refer to Daniel's opposition to the Jewish opposition to Antiochus IV because he believes God will accomplish the victory in His own time, in His own way, and for His purposes (the book of Daniel's emphasis on God' sovereignty, which is such a common element in apocalyptic literature)., 1112385=\u25a3 \"And against the man, My Associate\" The NIV translates this \"and against the man who is close to me.\" This is obviously a reference to a close associate (BDB 765). This is why identifying this shepherd with the one in 11:17 is misleading. This term (BDB 765) is used only here and in the book of Leviticus (cf. Lev. 5:21; 18:20; 19:15,17; 24:19; 25:14,15). It obviously means a close friend or covenant neighbor., 547772=10:14 \"latter days\" This Hebrew term (BDB 31) basically means \"end.\" It is used in a variety of ways, but in this context, it refers to the last part of human history. Brown, Driver, Briggs Lexicon define it as \"a prophetic phrase denoting the final period of the history so far as the speaker's perspective reaches, the sense thus varies with the context, but it often equals the ideal or Messianic future\" (p. 31)., 953210=3.\u00a0a prophetic utterance (e.g. Isa. 14:28; Jer. 23:33,34,38; Ezek. 12:10; Zech. 9:2; 12:1; Mal. 1:1), 478317=\u25a3 \"about the time of the evening offering\" Remember, the temple was destroyed. There were no offerings. The evening offering would have been about 3:00 p.m. Daniel kept the temple ritual alive by continuing his habit of prayer (cf. 6:10)!, 1039567=11:1 \"Open your doors\" This (BDB 834 I, KB 986) is a Qal IMPERATIVE (i.e. submit to be taken over). Verses 1-3 form a literary unit. This poem could relate to (1) chapters 9 and 10, the judgment of God on the surrounding nations or (2) the rest of chapter 11, the judgment of God on His own people., 469701=9:14, 1042180=The VERB (BDB 994, KB 1418, Pual PERFECT) means \"to despoil,\" \"devastate,\" or \"ruin.\" It can refer to, 757971=\u25a3 \"the four winds\" The number four is used to symbolize the entire known world (e.g. 1:8,18,20; Dan. 7:2; 11:4). These same \"four winds\" are mentioned in a military sense (BDB 924 #2a), as in Jer. 49:36; Ezek. 37:9; Dan. 8:8; and Zech. 6:5., 474097=9:17 \"for Thy sake, O Lord\" This is repeated in v. 19. Daniel supplicates YHWH to act so as to accomplish His purposes of world-wide witness and redemption through Israel., 365693=3.\u00a0\"forever and ever,\" 2:20, 120953=4.\u00a02:23, \"wisdom and power\", 855125=6:1 \"I lifted up my eyes again and looked\" See note at 1:8., 463121=9:7 \"righteousness belongs to Thee\" The term \"righteousness\" (cf. vv. 14,16) is the Hebrew word (BDB 841-842) for a \"measuring reed,\" \"ruler,\" or \"standard.\" God Himself is the standard of judgment., 989446=\u25a3 \"they will drink and be boisterous as with wine\" Both VERBS (BDB 1059, KB 1667 and BDB 242, KB 250) are Qal PERFECTS. This refers to the victory celebration of God's soldiers (cf. Ps. 78:65)., 53977=B.\u00a0God was/is in control of events and history as these pagan kings acknowledged (historical kings, cf. 2:46-49; 3:28-30; 4:34-37; 5:17-29; 6:25-27 and future kings, cf. 7:27; 8:25e; 9:24a,26b,27b; 11:35,45). God's people are to trust in Him and remain faithful in difficult times. God's people will receive the kingdom forever (cf. 7:17)!, 426756=8:18 \"I sank into a deep sleep\" The presence of the spiritual realm causes humans to be frightened and pass out (BDB 922, KB 1191, cf. Gen. 15:12; Job 4:13; Dan. 10:9). In Rev. 1:17 John looked as if he had died!, 114391=The problem is why it continues through chapter seven. H. C. Leupold even makes chapter 7 a part of the literary unit starting in chapter one. The truth is no one knows why Hebrew starts, Aramaic continues, and Hebrew concludes the book of Daniel. Some compare the structural pattern of Job (prose, poetry, prose) or Hammurabi's law code following the same pattern, but these are not in two languages, rather writing styles. Aramaic is a cognate Semitic language to Hebrew. Both are written in the same characters. It was known early in the Bible by its use in Gen. 31:47 (two words) and it appears as the language of diplomatic dialogue in II Kgs. 18:26. Imperial Aramaic was used from 600 to 330 b.c., 979991=9:12 \"Return\" This is a Qal IMPERATIVE. Verses 11 and 12 both are encouragement to the returning remnant (cf. Ezra and Nehemiah). Very few of the Jews in exile ever returned to Palestine., 1021977=\u25a3 \"their children will see it and be glad\" This speaks of social stability and peace, as does 9:17., 325727=c.\u00a0head of beast, Dan. 7:6,20, 962793=9:5 \"Askelon. . .Gaza. . .Ekron. . .Ashdod\" These are four of the five city states of the Philistines in the Promised Land (Gath was earlier destroyed by the Assyrians). The Philistines invaded Egypt around the 1200's, but were defeated and then settled in the southern coastal areas of Palestine. They were apparently of the same racial stock as the Phoenicians, possibly from Cypress or the Aegean Islands. They are the only uncircumcized people in Canaan and were traditional enemies of the people of God (cf. Judges, I Samuel). Because of vv. 5-7b, although they are going to be judged, they are also going to be included in the covenant people (cf. v. 7c-d). What a surprising message of grace!, 987557=5.\u00a0invasion of the land, Jer. 4:5; 6:1; Hos. 5:8; 8:1; Joel 2:1; Amos 2:2; 3:6; Zeph. 1:16, 105612=C.\u00a0Daniel's gift of interpreting dreams and visions parallels Joseph's gift in Gen. 41. Many of the terms used are similar except Gen. 41 is Hebrew and Dan. 2:4-7:28 is Aramaic., 224873=4:19 \"Daniel. . .was appalled for a while\" Daniel was apparently very loyal to Nebuchadnezzar II and regretted having to reveal this judgment. Several times in the book of Daniel, Daniel is spiritually and physically affected by the revelations he receives (cf. 7:15,28; 8:27; 10:16,17)., 1026931=\u25a3 \"Lebanon\" This refers to the realm of Hiram, later called Phoenicia. It was famous for its artisans and lumber (cf. I Kgs. 4:33; 5:6,9,14; 7:2; 16:17,21; Isa. 35:2). It was a place of famed beauty and fertility (cf. Song of Songs 4:8,11,15; 5:15; 7:4). It is included in the Promised Land in Deut. 1:7; 11:24 and Joshua 1:4., 306599=\u25a3 \"because he had trusted in his God\" It was not Daniel's innocence (cf. v. 22) that brought about his deliverance, but his faith (\"trusted\" BDB 1081, Haphel PERFECT) in YHWH (cf. Dan. 3:28). This same truth is recurrent throughout the OT (cf. I Chr. 5:20; II Chr. 20:20; Ps. 9:10; Isa. 26:3). This great truth becomes the key to Paul's emphasis on justification by faith in Rom. 4:3 and Gal. 3:6, which he anchors in Gen. 15:6., 367808=2.\u00a0true, 6:12; 7:16,19, 826994=\u25a3 \"the Lord of the whole earth\" Zechariah has been using the term adon (BDB 10) to address the angelic guide, but here and in 6:5 it refers to YHWH, the creator, sustainer, provider, and lover of all creation (cf. Josh. 3:11,13; Ps. 97:5; Micah 4:13). It is exactly this universal dimension of God's character which requires Jerusalem and the temple to be restored, because Messiah will come from the Jewish people and nation! God's redemptive plan includes the Gentiles, which surely surprised Haggai and the Jewish leadership (e.g. 9:7,10; 14:16)., 446317=A.\u00a0It is interesting to speculate how many of the earlier writings of the Hebrew prophets Daniel had read. It seems for sure he had read Ezekiel because he describes YHWH's throne in a similar way (i.e. \"wheels,\" cf. Ezek. 10:2,6,13 and Dan. 7:9). Many of the words and phrases Daniel uses are found in Isaiah. In this chapter we are told specifically that Daniel was familiar with the prophecy of Jeremiah (cf. 25:9-13; 29:10)., 747128=\u25a3 \"a measuring line\" This is a construction metaphor (BDB 286 and 551, cf. 1:16, different Hebrew word, BDB 876), used of (1) judgment/destruction (cf. II Kgs. 21:13; Isa. 34:11; Lam. 2:8) or (2) restoration (cf. 1:16; Jer. 31:38-40; Ezek. 41; Rev. 21:15-17)., 115184=For a good discussion of the ancient use of Aramaic see R. K. Harrison, Introduction to the Old Testament, pp. 201-210,1125., 535654=The exalted Christ is also described this same way in Rev. 1:13 and the seven angels with seven plagues are described this way in Rev. 15:6. This dress denotes a heavenly origin, near the throne of God., 24760=(4)\u00a0Joel 2:28-3:21, 643141=1.\u00a0Babylonian official in charge of the four Jewish youths, 1:7,8,9,10,11,18, 859461=6:5, 455868=9:4, 139289=2:35 \"were crushed\" Although the stone cut out of the mountain without hands strikes only the fourth kingdom, all others are crushed to fine powder (BDB 1089 Peal PERFECT, cf. v. 45). This seems to symbolize the ultimate overthrow of human government and the establishment of God's universal reign., 606310=11:19 This verse may refer to Antiochus III's attempt to gain revenue from the temple treasuries (\"fortresses,\" a Hebrew term which denotes a place of safety) in order to pay his requested tribute to Rome. His own citizens were enraged and assassinated him in 187 b.c. as he tried to rob the temple at Elymais., 800129=3:10 \"in that day\" This is a prophetic idiom (cf. 2:11) of the coming day of judgment, forgiveness, and restoration of God's plan for all humanity. It is common in Amos, Hosea, Micah, Zephaniah, and Joel., 918095=8:4 \"old men and old women\" Most of the elderly died because of the exile and those who grew old in Babylon could not easily return, therefore, elderly people in the land was a sign of lengthy prosperity (cf. Deut. 28:3) or the new age (cf. Isa. 65:20)., 268179=5:18 \"\u2018Nebuchadnezzar your father'\" The term \"father\" can refer to descendants in Hebrew (Semitic) usage. See note at 5:2., 698863=\u25a3 \"Zechariah\" The name means \"YHWH remembers.\" This is a very common Hebrew name, which is used twenty-nine times in the OT. Its meaning seems especially significant in light of the returning exiles' view that God had reestablished His covenant with them. He was a contemporary of Haggai. When one compares the dates (i.e. Hag. 1:1 with Zech. 1:1) Zechariah began preaching about two months later than Haggai., 1085029=The angel of the LORD is often seen as God's representative among the people (cf. Exod. 13:21; 14:19; 23:20-21; 32:34; 33:2,14-15,22). In two passages David is likened to the angel of the Lord (cf. I Sam. 29:9; II Sam. 14:17,20; 19:27). Remember there are three phrases (no VERBS) here which build on each other for literary, not theological, effect., 870472=6:12 \"then say to him, \u2018Thus says the Lord of hosts'\" It is difficult to follow the levels of direct and indirect speech in Zechariah. Here it is obvious the LORD directs Zechariah to speak on His behalf. Sometimes the angel of the LORD speaks on YHWH's behalf. It is possible that in certain contexts the angel of the LORD is the Messiah. The antecedent to the PRONOUNS is not always evident from the context., 756158=\u25a3 \"Flee\" This is a Qal IMPERATIVE of a Hebrew term (BDB 630, KB 681) used predominantly by Isaiah and Jeremiah. It is also used twice in Zech. 14:5., 164753=3:3 The repetitive nature of this chapter, both in the listing of the government officials and the musical instruments, is characteristic of (1) Hebraic writing; and (2) obelistic writing., 662433=1.\u00a0everlasting righteousness, 9:24, 957179=\u25a3 \"Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise\" This refers to the Phoenician coastal cities mentioned in Ezek. 28:3-5,7 as being proverbially wise. However, judgment came on them because of their pride (cf. Ezek. 28:2,5-6) and arrogance (cf. Ezek. 28:2,6,9)., 987470=4.\u00a0coronation of a king, I Kgs. 1:34,39; Ps. 47:5, 643255=2.\u00a0Jewish political (royal) leaders, 9:6,8, 1132932=The Septuagint and the Vulgate interpret the last phrase as \"no cold and ice\" (cf. New International Dictionary of Old Testament Theology and Exegesis, vol. 3, pp. 952, 995). However, the eschatological context may refer to the dwindling light (BDB 21) of the heavenly bodies (cf. Isa. 13:10; 24:23; 60:19; Jer. 4:23; Ezek. 32:7,8; Joel 2:31; 3:15; Matt. 24:29; Acts 2:19)., 1011276=10:3 \"My anger is kindled against the shepherds\" This is another Qal ACTIVE PARTICIPLE (BDB 944 I, KB 1258) and a Qal PERFECT VERB (BDB 354, KB 351), \"is hot.\" In Ezek. 34 (esp. v. 17) God also condemns His covenant people's civil and religious leaders for their lack of faithfulness to Him. The term \"male goats\" may refer to foreign leaders (TEV, cf. v. 11; Isa. 14:9; Jer. 51:40)., 1022148=\u25a3 \"their hearts will rejoice in the Lord\" This same VERB (BDB 162, KB 189, Qal IMPERFECT used as a JUSSIVE) was used in 9:9 (Qal IMPERATIVE) at the coming of the Lord. In this verse the root is used of exalting in the Lord Himself and His acts of deliverance and establishment of His people. This verse may be an allusion to Isa. 41:16., 844168=5:8 \"he threw her down\" The woman tried to escape, but the angel forced her into the ephah. The context favors the symbol as sinful Jews (cf. 5:3-4)., 821033=They may relate to the \"seven faceted stone\" of 3:9 or to the seven branched and cupped lampstand of 4:2. However, their function relates to the four angelic horsemen of the first vision and the four chariots of the last vision., 325794=2.\u00a0seat of visions, Dan. 2:28; 4:2,7,10; 7:1,15, 766561=2:9 \"I will wave My hand\" This is a physical gesture for divine judgment (BDB 631, KB 682, Hiphil PARTICIPLE, cf. Isa. 11:15; 19:16)., 136108=2:30, 650082=1.\u00a0shenah (BDB 446), also used of natural sleep, Dan. 2:1; 6:18, 714144=9.\u00a0\"lift up your eyes and see,\" 5:5, 304577=\u25a3 \"been able to deliver you from the lions\" Here is that wonderful play on the title for God \"the God who is able\" (cf. Dan. 3:17,29; Rom. 16:25; Eph. 3:20; Jude 24). Nothing is too difficult for YHWH (cf. Jer. 32:17). This whole book is about God's sovereignty and willingness to respond to those who trust Him (e.g. 3:28). Chapters 3 and 6 are lexically and theologically parallel., 645178=4.\u00a0stand for, 10:21; 11:1, 357144=1.\u00a0His suffering and death (e.g. Mark 8:31; 10:45; 14:21; Luke 9:22,44), 675401=In Matt. 27:9 Jesus attributes a quote to Jeremiah which is from Zech. 11:12-13. This was the beginning of the trend toward denying authorship of chapters 9-14 to Zechariah. However, even the Dead Sea Scrolls have Zechariah as a unity., 291116=\u25a3 \"the king planned to appoint him over the entire kingdom\" This parallels what Pharaoh did to Joseph in Gen. 41:40. There are many similarities between Joseph and Daniel., 1054412=11:10 \"my staff. . .Favor. . .to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples\" The symbolic destruction of the staff \"Favor\" shows God's attitude toward: (1) the Jewish people (Qal IMPERFECT); (2) the Jews of the Diaspora; or (3) that His attitude toward Gentile nations had changed! The VERB \"break\" (BDB 154, KB 180) has a violent connotation (cf. Isa. 10:33) of something being \"cut off\" or \"sawed off.\" It is used in the Piel for the destruction of Canaanite fertility objects (cf. Deut. 7:5; 12:3; II Chr. 14:3; 31:1; 34:4,7)., 842355=This Hebrew word could be \"what is seen\" (BDB 744, \"eye,\" cf. NKJV, NET, JPSOA) or some manuscripts have \"iniquity\" (BDB 730, cf. LXX, Peshitta, NRSV, TEV, NJB). The only difference between the two terms is between a waw and a yod. The understanding of \"iniquity\" fits the immediate context best (cf. vv. 8,11), however, the NET Bible asserts that \"eye\" in this verse is parallel with \"eye\" in 4:10. This one's evil is pervasive in the land as YHWH's knowledge is pervasive in the land., 1028626=The problem is trying to find the SUBJECT and OBJECT of vv. 11 and 12. Some assert that (1) it is the returnees because of v. 10, \"they,\" LXX; (2) it is the Messiah (MT, \"he\"); (3) it is YHWH (cf. v. 12; Isa. 43:2, The Pulpit Commentary, Zechariah, vol. 14, p. 108) and is an allusion to the Exodus (cf. JB and RSV translations). In my opinion, because v. 12 implies YHWH and another person (\"he\"), I believe that these verses are Messianic., 79781=1:6 \"Daniel\" His name means \"God (El) is my Judge\" (BDB 193)., 273530=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:5:29 \u00a029Then Belshazzar gave orders, and they clothed Daniel with purple and put a necklace of gold around his neck, and issued a proclamation concerning him that he now had authority as the third ruler in the kingdom., 1136796=\u25a3 \"in that day the Lord will be the only one, and His name the only one\" This is an emphasis on monotheism (cf. Exod. 8:10; 9:14; Deut. 4:35,39; 6:4-5; 33:26; I Sam. 2:2; II Sam. 22:32; I Kgs. 8:23; Ps. 86:8; Isa. 46:9; Jer. 10:6-7)., 1009407=\u25a3 \"They comfort in vain\" The VERB (BDB 636, KB 688) is also a Piel IMPERFECT. The NOUN (BDB 210 I) \"vain,\" or \"empty,\" so common in Ecclesiastes, is the same root as \"idol\" (cf. II Kgs. 17:15; Jer. 23:32; 27:9,10). They are nothing, just figments of human superstition and fear, as is this false hope from false prophets!, 836572=2.\u00a0the oath broken turns into a curse (cf. Deut. 29:18,19,20-21; Jer. 21:10; Ezek. 16:59; 17:16,18,19; Dan. 9:11), 533546=10:3 \"did not eat\" This was not a total fast., 457970=9:5 \"we have sinned\" Notice the recurrent theme, vv. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17. Daniel identifies himself with his people and makes confession, as did Moses (e.g. Exod. 32:32; Num. 11:2; 21:7) and Isaiah (e.g. 6:5)., 1052488=\u25a3 \"for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul was weary of me\" There are several theories about the PRONOUN's antecedents. This shows the attitude of the godly shepherd (i.e. \"impatient\" BDB 894, KB 1126, Qal IMPERFECT, cf. Num. 21:4; Jdgs. 10:26; Job 21:4) because of the rebellious attitude of the people (i.e. the sheep of v. 9; \"weary\" BDB 103, KB 119, Qal PERFECT may mean (1) \"nauseated,\" \"loathed\" (but there are no cognates); (2) this shows the godly shepherd's attitude toward the three shepherds (NRSV); or (3) this shows the godly shepherd's attitude toward the sheep merchants (cf. vv. 7,11)., 954961=The term does not have a negative connotation (e.g. II Sam. 14:17; Isa. 32:18). It is even used of God's resting place in II Chr. 6:41 and Ps. 132:8. It is also used in connection with the nations coming to YHWH in Isa. 11:10., 205549=4:6 \"\u2018So I gave orders'\" Nebuchadnezzar can make decrees (cf. 2:9,15; 3:10,29), but he could not produce the desired result (and neither could his wise men). This is in stark contrast to God's will being accomplished., 553417=c.\u00a0ish, 10:5, 655925=12:4 \"Conceal these words and seal up the book until the end of time\" The TEV and NJB translations make this verse a separate paragraph. This concept of \"seal up the words\" is found in 8:26 and 12:9. The \"sealing\" seems to refer to (1) protection (cf. Jer. 32:11-14); (2) spiritual understanding (cf. Isa. 29:9-12); or (3) secrecy (cf. Isa. 8:16). It helps me to know that these words were not easily understandable to Daniel, nor his contemporaries. I think that the last generation of suffering and dying believers will understand some texts that the preceding generations have never fully understood., 1073529=3.\u00a0a region, 13:2; 14:10, 211785=2.\u00a0Hebrew - 8:3,5,15,19; 9:18; 10:5,10,16; 11:2; 12:5, 42400=C.\u00a0Some scholars who reject predictive prophecy are troubled by (1) the accuracy of the historical details of Dan. 11:2-35; (2) the partial accuracy of 11:36-39; and (3) the inaccuracy of 11:40-45. They date the book just after its last specific prediction in 11:35, about Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164 b.c.)., 261781=5:10 \"the queen\" The Septuagint adds a phrase that says that Belshazzar called the queen. This is because it was highly unusual for anyone to enter the king's presence without being summoned (cf. Esther 4:11). However, the queen-mother had a unique position in the royal court and could probably come and go at will. There has been much debate as to her identity: (1) Nebuchadnezzar's queen, (2) Nebuchadnezzar's daughter, or (3) one of Nabonidus' wives. Options #1 or 2 seem most likely because she knew of Daniel and his gifts., 834740=\u25a3 \"a flying scroll\" This may imply an outstretched banner (VERB, BDB 733 I, KB 800, Qal ACTIVE PARTICIPLE and NOUN, BDB 166). From v. 3 its message is characterized as a \"curse.\" This same negative connotation connected to a \"scroll\" is found in Jer. 36:2 and Ezek. 2:9., 325879=3.\u00a0chief, Ezra 5:10, 151184=These two Aramaic terms (BDB 1112, 1104) usually denote governmental leadership (cf. 3:2,3,27; 6:8), but here they denote leadership over the guild of wise men., 377096=Personally I think, because of 2:38 and 8:20-21, that the third sequenced empire is Greece. What Antiochus did has a multiple significance as does the phrase \"the abomination of desolation.\", 619398=11:35 This shows that the purpose of the trials and problems that God's people face is not a direct result of sin, as the Exile was, but is a direct connection because they follow the God of heaven. The entire book of Daniel is a series of conflicts between God and His people and organized human government controlled by the evil one and his angels (cf. Ps. 2; Ezek. 38-39)., 617006=11:31 \"desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice\" This phrase refers to the temple in Jerusalem and its sacrificial system (cf. 8:11; 9:27; 12:11). Many see this as referring to the attempt by Jason, the brother of Onias III, to become High Priest. Jason, through intrigue in the Seleucid court, became High Priest, but in three years he was replaced with another Seleucid sympathizer, Menelaus. Onias III was finally killed in 171 b.c. because he objected to Menelaus' attempt to Hellenize the Jews., 417770=This probably refers to the idol of Zeus Olympius, that Antiochus placed in the temple (II Maccabees 6:2). This VERB, \"makes desolate\" (BDB 1030, KB 1563, Qal ACTIVE PARTICIPLE) may be a word play from the Canaanite deity, Ba'al Shamem (\"Lord of Heaven\"), because \"heaven\" has the same consonants as \"makes desolate.\" Zeus was the Greek counterpart of Ba'al., 794566=\u25a3 \"if you will perform My service\" This refers to the ritual duties of the Levites and priests. The VERB (BDB 1036, KB 1581, Qal IMPERFECT) and DIRECT OBJECT (BDB 1038) come from the same Hebrew root. God wants covenant obedience from priests and people., 920218=8:7 \"save\" The Hebrew VERB \"save\" (BDB 446, KB 448 Hiphil PARTICIPLE) is used in several senses., 662505=2.\u00a0everlasting life, 12:2, 1062136=11:16 This verse expresses in a negative way (cf. Ezek. 34:1-4) the very attributes of YHWH and His Messiah (cf. Ezek. 34:11-16,23). This may be the reality of v. 9., 259704=\u25a3 \"necklace of gold\" Necklaces were symbols of rank and authority in the Ancient Near East(cf. Gen. 41:42; Song of Songs 4:9; Ezek. 16:11). However, the Aramaic phrase (BDB 1090 and 1087) might refer to a solid gold collar, designating rank, not a necklace at all., 874796=6:14 These four Hebrew names refer to those mentioned in v. 10, but two of the names are different. The Peshitta, NRSV, TEV, and NIV take the word hen (BDB 336), which means \"grace,\" \"favor,\" or \"kindness\" (\"gracious one,\" possibly their host) as referring to Josiah, son of Zephaniah (cf. v. 10)., 363844=a.\u00a0in the OT they are rarely called \"saints\" or \"holy ones\" (cf. 8:24; Ps. 16:3; 34:9). The designation probably comes from Exod. 19:5-6; Deut. 14:21; 26:19., 306461=6:23 \"no injury whatever was found on him\" This is parallel to Dan. 3:27., 367738=1.\u00a0certain or sure, 2:8,45; 3:24, 855249=\u25a3 \"four chariots\" Four (BDB 916) is often used as a symbol of the whole world (or known world, cf. Dan. 2,7) or universe (cf. Dan. 8:8; 11:4; Zech. 6:5, see John J. David, Biblical Numerology, pp. 122-123; Encyclopedia Judaica, vol. 12, pp. 1255-1259; or Milton S. Terry, Biblical Hermeneutics, p. 382)., 1016124=10:5 \"treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle\" \"Treading down\" (BDB 100, KB 115) is a Qal ACTIVE PARTICIPLE, possibly \"trampling.\" This phrase is a standard idiom of defeat (cf. II Sam. 22:43). However, in this context where rain is mentioned (cf. v. 1) it may refer to mud caused by God's special presence (cf. Jdgs. 4-5)., 645241=5.\u00a0stand up, 8:18; 10:11, 537961=This Hebrew term (BDB 242) is translated \"murmur,\" \"roar,\" \"crowd,\" or \"multitude.\" In Ezekiel this word and \"the sound of many waters\" are parallel (cf. Ezek. 1:24; 43:2). It is used of the exalted Christ in Rev. 1:15. In Rev. 14:2; 19:6, it is used of the sound of the authoritative voice of one from God., 541380=See note at 9:23, where this same expression is used of Daniel by an angel., 249247=D.\u00a0Belshazzar had confidence the fortifications of the city of Babylon could not be overcome. For a good discussion of the city see La Moine F. DeVries, Cities of the Biblical World, Hendrickson Publishers, 1997, pp. 13-21., 121028=5.\u00a03:13, \"rage and anger\", 651953=\u25a3 \"these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt\" This refers to a general resurrection (cf. John 5:28,29; Matt. 25:46; and Acts 24:15-16). This is one of the earliest Scriptures which discusses the developing understanding of the need for an afterlife in order for God to set straight the evil which has been done in this world (cf. Job 14:7-12,13-14; 19:25-26; Ps. 16:10; 49:15; 73:24; Isa. 25:8; 26:19). Apparently the rabbinical understanding of a divided Sheol/Hades into \"paradise\" and \"Tartarus\" developed from these early texts related to resurrection., 163304=\u25a3 \"of gold\" This seems to mean overlaid with gold and we have biblical examples of this, such as (1) Aaron's golden calf (Exod. 32); (2) Isaiah 40:19; 41:7; 44:10; (3) Jeremiah 10:4,14; and also (4) Herodotus 1.183., 1073452=2.\u00a0inhabitants of a region, 12:12; 13:8, 231761=4:30 \"the king reflected and said\" Pride has always been the major problem of fallen humanity (cf. Gen. 3; Isa. 14; Ezek. 28). This king had much to be proud of, as he is known from the Babylonian Archives as a great builder. Babylon's Hanging Gardens were one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The city itself had huge double walls. The inner wall of the city was 21 feet thick, 50 cubits high with towers every 60 feet. The outer wall was 11 feet thick, 42 miles in circumference, and 6 feet beyond the outer wall was a man-made moat, which channeled the waters of the Euphrates around the city for protection., 610764=\u25a3 \"the prince of the covenant\" This is a difficult phrase in light of Daniel's previous use of these two theologically loaded words in 9:26. There have been many possibilities suggested for this reference: (1) some see it as referring to Ptolemy VI Philometor, but better, (2) others believe that it refers to Onias III (198-175 b.c.), the Jewish High Priest (cf. TEV) who opposed Antiochus IV and his Jewish conspirators (Onias' brother Jason), who attempted to Hellenize their fellow Jews. He was removed in 175 b.c. and killed in 171 b.c., 836497=1.\u00a0swear an oath (cf. Deut. 29:12,14), 110431=\u25a3 \"Chaldeans\" This seems to refer to astrologers. However, the term in Gen. 11:28 has a racial connotation (cf. 1:4; II Kgs. 24:2; Jer. 35:11; and also in Assyrian documents relating to Nabopolassar). Some have dealt with this changing meaning by asserting a misunderstanding in the Sumerian root, \"master-builders,\" instead of racial lineage. The fifth century b.c. historian, Herodotus, in his Persian Wars, mentions a class of priests whose origins went back to Cyrus' day., 914152=\u25a3 \"I am exceedingly jealous\" See full notes at 1:14., 716122=1.\u00a0angels (compare 1:8,10 with v. 11), 365768=4.\u00a0\"live forever\" (Nebuchadnezzar), 2:4; 3:9 (Belshazzar), 5:10; (Darius), 6:6,21, \"lives forever\" (YHWH), 4:34, 379297=\u25a3 \"his dominion will be taken away, annihilated and destroyed forever\" The first VERB (BDB 1105) is a Haphel IMPERFECT and the next two (BDB 1116 and 1078) are Haphel INFINITIVES. This deals with the ultimate judgment and complete destruction of all powers that are opposed to God! There is both temporal judgment and eschatological judgment. Verses like this are what causes some to assert the annihilation of the wicked (cf. Edward Fudge, The Fire That Consumes: A Biblical and Historical Study of the Doctrine of Final Punishment), but Dan. 12:2 specifically mentions two eternal destinies (cf. Matt. 25:46)., 495782=The Brown, Driver, and Briggs Lexicon (BDB 871) says \"the most holy place\" refers to Jerusalemand its hills and lists vv. 16 and 20; Isa. 11:9; Jer. 31:23; Ezek. 20:40 as some parallels. The NOUN construct is usually used of a place, in this case the restored temple, but the contextual ambiguity allows the phrase to refer to a person (used of a person, Aaron, in I Chr. 23:13). Therefore, I think it refers to the coming Messiah because it is the concluding phrase in a series of culminating phrases. The end has come, victory has been won through God's character and God's provision of (1) the holiness of holinesses (E. J. Young); (2) the Son of Man (7:13); or (3) the Suffering Servant (Isa. 53). The anointed One is anointed in the new Jerusalem (Rev. 21) or the heavenly sanctuary (Heb. 8-9). Jesus Himself is the new temple (cf. John 2:13-22 [esp. v. 19]; Matt. 26:61; 27:40; Mark 14:58; 15:29; Acts 6:14). He is the new focus of worship (cf. Heb. 9:11-28)., 1134677=14:8 \"living waters will flow out of Jerusalem\" This seems to be used in the sense of life-giving, supernatural waters (cf. Gen. 2:10), which issue not only in physical bounty, but also in spiritual bounty. These waters are often referred to in the Bible (cf. Ps. 46:4; Isa. 33:21-23; 49:10; Ezek. 47:1-12; Joel 3:18; John 4:13-15; 6:35; 7:37-38; Rev. 22:1,2 and in a negative way in Jer. 2:13; Zech. 9:11). Jerusalem, because of YHWH's presence, is the center of all creation. The King is enthroned there!, 1105956=13:4 \"in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies\" Verses 4-6 describe the excuses that these false prophets will make when they are confronted with their false prophecies. A good descriptive parallel to \"ashamed\" (BDB 101) prophets is Micah 3:5-7., 383134=7:28 \"\u2018at this point the revelation ended'\" Chapter 7 is a literary unit. It is linked to chapter 6, but the vision is complete in itself and covers the entire history of mankind from Daniel's day to the eschaton., 553355=b.\u00a0Adam, 10:16,18, 1042363=1.\u00a0cities, Isa. 15:1; 23:1; Jer. 48:1; 49:3, 1069963=2.\u00a0Their repentance and faith in the crucified Messiah (cf. John 19:37 and Rev. 1:7)., 658191=The term \"the many\" can refer to (1) faithful Jews (cf. 11:33,39); (2) the rebellious Jews who supported the Seleucid dynasty (cf. 11:14); or (3) all humans (cf. 12:2)., 987344=3.\u00a0information gathering (usually about military matters), Jdgs. 3:27; 6:34; I Sam. 13:3, 343747=\u25a3 \"thrones were set up\" The King James Version has \"cast down,\" but the NKJV corrects this mistranslation by \"the thrones were put in place\" (i.e. arranged, BDB 1113, Peil PERFECT). There have been three major theories concerning who sits on these thrones: (1) angels (cf. Ps. 89:7, 8); (2) saints (cf. LXX v. 22; Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:30; I Cor. 6:2; Rev. 20:4); (3) some type of judges, identity unknown. Whomever these thrones represent, it is obvious that this is a court scene in heaven (cf. Rev. 4-5; 20:11-15; Matt. 25:31-46)., 625736=4.\u00a0arrogant words, Dan. 11:36 (cf. 7:8,11; Rev. 13:5-6), 715966=In Zechariah it is used several times in the eight visions (cf. 1:8,10,21; 2:1; 4:1; 6:12), where it refers to:, 319625=D.\u00a0These Gentile kingdoms became progressively anti-God. It is surprising that these kingdoms, which seem to be in chronological order (cf. v. 17, are crushed simultaneously (cf. 2:35,45). This crushing represents God's ultimate and complete victory (cf. 2:44; 7:14,18,27), not that all these empires have to be in power or in existence at the same time (cf. vv. 11-12)., 1004569=10:1 \"Ask rain\" This is a Qal IMPERATIVE (BDB 981, KB 1371). Rain was a gift from God, e.g. Isa. 30:23; Jer. 10:13). The emphasis of 1:17; 9:17 is on social stability and fruitfulness being from YHWH. Famine was part of the curse of Deut. 28 (cf. Jer. 14:1-6), but abundant rain was also part of the promised blessing if they followed God (cf. Deut. 11:13,14; 28:12). During Israel's periods of idolatry (e.g. Hos. 4) she ascribed fertility to Ba'al (Canaanite storm and fertility god) and not to YHWH (cf. Jer. 14:22). Chapter 10 highlights this grave mistake (cf. 14:17)., 1013369=\u25a3 \"He will make them like His majestic horse in battle\" The VERB (BDB 962 I, KB 1321) is a Qal PERFECT. The term majestic (BDB 217 I) is used to describe horses in Job 39:19-25, esp. v. 20. This same word is used in 6:13 for the majesty of the coming king, but here of His war mount. These are metaphors for God's people being used (cf. Jer. 51:20-33) and honored by God's Messiah when He returns to rule and reign., 541493=\u25a3 \"understand the words\" Not only was Daniel gifted by God for the understanding and interpreting of dreams and visions (cf. 1:17), but several times the angel announced that a special understanding was provided Daniel (cf. 8:16,17). Daniel must cooperate in this process and remain alert., 456145=This is the Hebrew word for \"to throw\" (BDB 392, KB 389), used in the Hithpael as an idiom for \"confess\" (cf. Lev. 16:21; 26:40; Num. 5:7; Ezra 10:1; Neh. 9:3; Dan. 9:3,20). Robert Young, Analytical Concordance, p. 196, says it means \"to throw out the hand\" when the term refers to \"confessing YHWH's name\" (cf. I Kgs. 8:33,35; II Chr. 6:24,26). Whether there was a physical gesture denoting the confession of sin is uncertain, but probable., 335016=7:6 \"a leopard which had on its back four wings of a bird\" This refers to the speed of the military conquest of Alexander the Great. Greece then is the third predatory Gentile Empire (cf. 8:21). The symbolic number \"four\" may refer to its conquest of the whole known world (cf. v. 2)., 123622=2:15, 1085417=12:9 This shows the continuing metaphor of God's sovereign protection of His people. These invading nations were defeated by Judean forces, but through YHWH's empowerment!, 400105=8:4 \"I saw the ram butting westward, northward and southward \" Many use this as parallel to the three ribs in the bear's mouth, Dan. 7:5, to describe the three directions of Medo-Persian conquest., 368040=7:20, 325936=4.\u00a0summary, Dan. 7:1 (BDB 1112), 421239=8:15 \"\u2018I sought to understand'\" As the Gentile kings needed Daniel's God-given gift to understand their dreams, so Daniel needs heavenly beings to help him. Angelic mediation and interpretation is one of the characteristics of apocalyptic literature. Humans cannot discover truth. It must be revealed!, 151382=2:49 \"and Daniel made request of the king\" Daniel did not forget his prayer partners and they, too, were put in places of authority. This distinction between Daniel's task and the other three Hebrew children sets the stage of Daniel 3 where Daniel apparently is not present., 1130394=This seems to refer to a city, possibly also mentioned in Micah 1:11 (\"Beth-ezel\"), which shows the terminus of this supernaturally-made valley (cf. NRSV)., 211700=1.\u00a0Aramaic - 2:31; 4:10,13; 7:2,5,7,8(twice),13, 1077707=12:4 \"in that day\" This is a common theme in the literary unit of chapters 12-14. It is used sixteen times and refers to an eschatological future (cf. Zeph. 1:14-18; 3:16; Amos 5:18-20; Joel 1:15; 2:11; 3:14; Mal. 4:5)., 643335=3.\u00a0God Himself, 8:11,25, 79423=This is literally \"stand before the king,\" (BDB 763, KB, Qal IMPERFECT), which is an idiom for service (cf. Deut. 10:8; 17:12; 18:5,7). The NRSV catches the historical setting of Nebuchadnezzar stationing young men from all the conquered lands around his court room to show how extensive his empire was., 231552=4:29 \"he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon\" The ancients used the roof in the summertime as a cool place to rest and sleep., 555217=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:10:18-11:1 \u00a018 Then this one with human appearance touched me again and strengthened me. 19He said, \"O man of high esteem, do not be afraid. Peace be with you; take courage and be courageous!\" Now as soon as he spoke to me, I received strength and said, \"May my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.\" 20Then he said, \"Do you understand why I came to you? But I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia; so I am going forth, and behold, the prince of Greece is about to come. 21However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. (Yet there is no one who stands firmly with me against these forces except Michael your prince. 11:1In the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to be an encouragement and a protection for him.\"), 533951=10:4 \"on the twenty-fourth day of the first month\" This date reveals that Daniel fasted through the Feast of Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread (cf. Exod. 12; Hag. 1:15; 2:10, 18, 20; Zech. 1:7)., 137877=2:31 The statue is described as:, 968231=2.\u00a0those who remain faithful and obedient to YHWH (e.g. Isa. 10:20-22; Amos 5:15; Micah 5:3,7,8), 436383=The redundant \"Prince of princes\" is a Hebrew superlative, \"the greatest of all rulers\" (i.e. King of Kings, cf. 2:37,47; Ezek. 26:7; or [God of gods]; Ezra 7:12)., 77720=Because Gen. 11:28 states that Ur of the Chaldeans was the home of Terah and his family. Chaldeans may have been ethnically Semitic (i.e. same racial group as the Hebrews)., 1108328=13:6 \"And one will say to him, \u2018What are these wounds between your arms'\" The false prophet will be easily recognized by special cultic marks on his body. \"Between his arms\" is a Hebrew idiom (BDB 388) for somewhere on his back, chest, arms, or hands. There seem to be two OT allusions to this practice: (1) the prophets of Ba'al (cf. I Kgs. 18:28) and (2) special pagan practices for mourning (cf. Lev. 19:28; 21:5; Deut. 14:1; Jer. 16:6; 41:5; 48:37)., 121101=6.\u00a04:2, \"signs and wonders\", 649949=1.\u00a0yashen (BDB 445), which is normally used of natural sleep, but in Dan. 12:2, of death, 374642=7:25 Joyce G. Baldwin, Daniel, p. 146, points out the four characteristics of the fourth kingdom, 751112=2:5 \"wall of fire\" This seems to refer to the Shekinah (to dwell with permanently, cf. v. 11) cloud of the glory which accompanied the Israelites during the Exodus experience (cf. Exod. 14:19-20; Isa. 60:18). See SPECIAL TOPIC: FIRE at Daniel 7:10., 553042=1.\u00a0MASCULINE, SINGULAR PRONOUN, 7:16, 1071913=\u25a3 \"concerning Israel\" This is the only use of \"Israel\" in this chapter and it seems to refer to all of the Jewish people, not just the northern tribes (cf. 9:1,13; 11:14). During this period the Jewish people only controlled a small area around Jerusalem., 323980=\u25a3 \"Daniel saw\" It is interesting that chapters 1-6 are written in the third person, as is 7:1, but the first person predominates chapters 7-12 (e.g. 7:2,6,7,8,9,11[twice],13,15,16,19,21,28)., 199046=4:1 \"Nebuchadnezzar\" Verses 1-3 are in chapter 3 in the Hebrew Bible, but this context obviously starts a new section. His name means \"may Nebo guard the boundary\" (cf. v. 8)., 1073381=1.\u00a0all the earth, 12:1,3; 14:9,17, 227062=4:26, 127873=\u25a3 \"mystery\" This Aramaic word (BDB 1112) , raz, means \"to hide,\" \"to keep a secret.\" It is used several times in Daniel (cf. 2:18,19,27,28,29,30,47; 4:9). It becomes a central theme in apocalyptic literature and is mentioned often in the Dead Sea Scrolls. God reveals His hidden counsel to His prophets (cf. Gen. 18:17; Jer. 23:18; Dan. 9:22; Amos 3:7)., 92976=This type of counselor, magician, is used (1) in Egypt (cf. Gen. 41:8,24; Exod. 7:11,22; 8:15; 9:11; Isa. 19:11-12); (2) in Babylon (cf. 1:20; 2:2; Isa. 44:25; Jer. 50:35; 51:57; and also (3) in Persia (cf. Esther 1:13; 6:13)., 853448=Yet, it must be asserted that the term \"Branch\" may refer to Zerubbabel (cf. 3:8). It is obvious that Joshua and Zerubbabel are linked together (cf. 4:1,14; 6:13). This linking of king and priest is also present in Ps. 110:1,4 and implied in I Sam. 2:35., 36538=d.\u00a0the specificity of the predictions, especially chapter 11, relating to the Seleucid and the Ptolomies' struggle for control of Palestine, but after 11:40 the predictions do not fit Antiochus IV, 1083169=12:7 \"The Lord also will save the tents of Judah first\" The VERB (BDB 446) is a Hiphil PERFECT. There are two ways to understand this phrase., 267847=5:17 Daniel forcibly (JUSSIVE and IMPERATIVE), but politely, rejects the king's offer of gifts, rewards, and position. Daniel can read the prophetic words. He knows the Babylonian kingdom is at an end! Daniel knew Belshazzar would be giving everything to Cyrus' army very soon., 370235=Notice that the titles \"the Ancient of Days\" (cf. 7:9,13) and \"the Highest One\" (cf. 7:18,25,27) are synonymous. This is also true of \"the Most High\" and \"the Highest One\" of v. 25., 365937=5.\u00a0\"which will never be destroyed,\" 2:44a; 7:18, 535894=10:6 \"His body\" This description is similar to the exalted Christ of Rev. 1:13-16 (E. J. Young thinks it is the pre-incarnate Christ); however, vv. 11ff show that he is an angel sent to inform Daniel. Could the pre-incarnate Christ be thwarted for three weeks by a national angel? I think not!, 733871=Here Jerusalem and Zion are metaphors, not for a city, but for a people. YHWH originally chose Jerusalem as the place for His name to dwell (cf. Deut. 12:5,11,21; 14:23-24; 16:2,6,11; 26:2; Neh. 1:9). This would be the location of the central sacrificial shrine., 918413=8:5 \"boys and girls playing\" This was a sign of God's blessing (cf. Deut. 28:4) and normal social life. This shows the reversal of YHWH's curse (i.e. the fall of Jerusalem, cf. Deuteronomy 27-29) and His restored presence and blessing!, 430884=8:23 \"a king will arise, insolent and skilled in intrigue\" This seems to describe Antiochus IV Epiphanes' rise to power., 838301=5:4 \"the one who swears falsely by My name\" This covenant violation (i.e. \"swear\" BDB 989) could involve two different ways of taking God's name in vain., 952881=1.\u00a0a load or burden carried by a donkey or camel (e.g. Isa. 46:1-2), metaphorical for people (e.g. Num. 11:11,17; Deut. 1:12), 229471=This is literally \"tear off\" or \"break off\" (BDB 1108, Peal IMPERATIVE, cf. Gen. 27:40). Humans have been given a free will. They must exercise it for righteousness, not self. There are pivotal moments of appropriate choices and accompanying actions. Seize the moral moment! Current choices determine future conditions., 121176=7.\u00a05:11, \"illumination, insight, and wisdom\", 467814=9:11 \"transgressed\" The word appears here and in 8:23. Its basic meaning is to go beyond a known boundary (BDB 716, KB 778, Qal PEFRECT)., 786387=\u25a3 \"who has chosen Jerusalem\" YHWH has chosen (BDB 103, KB 119, Qal ACTIVE PARTICIPLE) Jerusalem again as in the days of Moses. This statement relates to 1:17 and 2:12. God's renewed covenant is evidenced by:, 679582=4. An inquiry of Zechariah concerning fasting, 7:1-8:23, 700862=The expression \"very angry\" (BDB 893) is used several times in Zechariah (cf. 1:2 [twice]; 1:15 [twice]; 7:12; and 8:14). YHWH was angry with His people because of their sin (cf. 7:12; 8:14) and also at the nations He used to judge His people (cf. 1:15)., 980273=This term (BDB 996, KB 1427), however, is often used for repentance (cf. 1:3,4). God's people must return to Him, not just to a geographical location or even to an ancient promise. Biblical faith is personal. See Special Topic: Repentance at Zech. 1:3., 591265=11:4 \"as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out\" Alexander the Great conquered the known world of his day and died of a fever at the age of 32 in Babylon (323 b.c.)., 300927=Aramaic grammar determines that this phrase is INDICATIVE, not JUSSIVE (NRSV, NAB), with an emphasis on \"your God\" (cf. Anchor Bible, vol. 23, p. 195). Again, the impotence of earthly monarchs is contrasted with the power and authority of the God of Judah (cf. 3:17,28)., 939596=\u25a3 \"we have heard that God is with you\" God's presence is the greatest blessing (cf. Isa. 7:14; 8:8,10; 45:14) and the goal of creation (cf. Gen. 1:26-27; 3:8-9). The barrier (cf. Gen. 3:10-21) between God and mankind is removed., 298706=6:13 \"who is one of the exiles from Judah\" Racial and religious prejudices are used to attack Daniel., 69055=\u25a3 \"vessels of the house of God\" This refers to the utensils and furniture of the temple (cf. Jer. 27:19-20; II Chr. 36:7). These are mentioned again in Dan. 5:2 and Ezra 1:5-11., 304171=6:19 This verse shows the King's anxiety!, 735746=1:19 \"the angel who was speaking with me\" Angelic mediation (cf. v. 9) is one characteristic of apocalyptic literature, as is the use of symbolic numbers (cf. v. 18) and colors (cf. v. 8)., 207788=If this phrase is from a polytheist (cf. v. 8a; 5:11,14) then surely this is not a reference to YHWH or His Spirit (the textual evidence is that the qualifying adjective \"holy\" is PLURAL, however, there is a Hebrew PLURAL equivalent in Josh. 24:19). The context (v. 9) implies that Nebuchadnezzar remembered Daniel's previous help of dream interpretation in chapter 2; if so, then this could be translated like the NKJV (cf. vv. 9,18). Remember the consistent theological emphasis is YHWH's power and control versus the Babylonian pantheon and government (cf. 2:20-23). \"The spirit\" would be understood as YHWH's influence in Daniel's giftedness (cf. 2:27-28,30,47)., 713820=7.\u00a0\"what do you see?\" \"I see,\" 4:2, 872460=The title \"Branch\" is used as a VERB (BDB 855, KB 1033, Qal IMPERFECT). This may imply a world-wide kingdom (cf. Isa. 45:22; 52:10; Micah 5:4; Matt. 28:18-20; Luke 24:47; Acts 1:8) or a renewed (Davidic) kingdom (cf. II Sam. 7; Isa. 11:1)., 809632=\u25a3 \"returned\" Because of the use of this same word (BDB 996, KB 1427, Qal IMPERFECT) in 5:1 and 6:1, \"and came again\" is a better understanding (cf. NKJV, NRSV, TEV, NJB). Possibly the angel had left so that the prophet could rest., 899003=\u25a3 \"mercy\" The term (BDB 933) originally had a family orientation (\"from the womb\"). This same term was used earlier in the angel's prayer to God about not having \"compassion\" for Jerusalem. The two terms, \"kindness\" and \"mercy\" are used in Dan. 1:9 to describe God's graciousness to Daniel through Nebuchadnezzar's overseer. As God treats us, we as His people should treat one another (cf. I John 3:16). Our attitudes and actions show to whom we belong!, 982461=9:13 \"I will bend Judah as My bow\" This chapter is filled with paradoxes! The coming Messianic peace is mentioned in vv. 8-11 and yet v. 13 speaks again of war (BDB 201, KB 231 Qal PERFECT). Possibly this verse shows the promise of v. 8!, 983450=3.\u00a0YHWH arouses the inhabitants of Zion against the Greeks, 9:13, 121268=8.\u00a05:18, \"sovereignty, grandeur, glory, and majesty\", 597230=11:9 There is a time gap of two years between verse 8 and 9. There is no historical record of this incident., 836331=5:3 \"the curse\" This Hebrew term (BDB 46) has two related covenantal meanings., 44048=a.\u00a0if the same as 5:31, then around 539 b.c., 480280=9:23 \"the command was issued\" This is literally, \"a word went out\" (BDB 422, KB 425, Qal PERFECT). It may have come from the powerful angel as in 8:16 or from God (cf. Isa. 45:23; 55:11). Even before Daniel finished praying heaven had responded!, 108219=The verb \"was troubled\" (BDB 821, KB 952, Hithpael IMPERFECT) is also used of Pharaoh (also note Isa. 19:3) in Gen. 41:8 (Niphal). There are many similarities between Joseph and Daniel's gifts and ministries., 914309=\u25a3 \"Zion\" This is one of the seven hills in Jerusalem, but it came to stand for the entire city, including Mount Moriah on which the temple stood. See note at 1:14., 625868=\u25a3 \"against the God of gods\" The term \"gods\" is elim (BDB 42), which is not used of the Hebrew God, except here. Usually it refers to the gods of the nations (cf. Exod. 15:11). Theologically it is parallel to Dan. 2:47 where, in the Aramaic section of the book, Elohim is used (cf. Deut. 10:17)., 257666=\u25a3 \"plaster of the wall of the king's palace\" This is also the Aramaic word for \"lime,\" \"quicklime,\" or \"plaster\" (BDB 1086 and 162). From current archaeology we have learned that the main throne room in Babylon had white plaster on two walls., 953044=2.\u00a0Levites carrying the tabernacle (e.g. Num. 4:15,19,24,27,49) and, in worship, possibly Levitical singers lifting their voices, 170786=3:6,15 \"immediately\" Literally this is \"same hour\" (BDB 1116). This is the first use of the term \"hour\" in the OT. There is some discussion if the term and concept began with the Babylonians or the Greeks. We must remember that this does not refer to our precise sixty minutes because they were using more crude timing instruments., 817207=\u25a3 \"grace, grace to it\" The Hebrew term (BDB 336) is doubled for emphasis. It is also used in 12:10 for God's grace or favor. This probably refers to God's blessing on the rebuilt temple (cf. Ezra 3:10-11)., 487389=There have been three major theories about this decree related to Persian monarchs: (1) Cyrus II, known as Cyrus the Great, allowed all captive people to return to their homes in 538 B.C. (cf. Isa. 44:26-28; Ezra 1); (2) Artaxerxes to Ezra in 458 b.c. allowed more priests and Levites to return to Jerusalem with Ezra (cf. in Aramaic, Ezra 7:11-26); and (3) Artaxerxes to Nehemiah, 445 b.c. allowed Nehemiah to go to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls (cf. Neh. 1:3; 2:3-8)., 493670=The Hebrew word olam (i.e. \"everlasting,\" BDB 841) must be interpreted in light of its context. See note on olam at 7:18. This context is future culmination or consummation (cf. Isa. 51:6,8; Jer. 23:5-6). Righteousness (BDB 761) is the character (standard) of God. See SPECIAL TOPIC: RIGHTEOUSNESS at 4:27. Creation was meant to reflect God's character (cf. I Thess. 4:7; 5:23; II Thess. 2:13; Titus 2:14). See note at 9:7. The goal of salvation is to be like God (cf. Lev. 19:2; Matt. 5:48). Believers are not only called to heaven at death, but to Christlikeness now. God desires a people who reflect His holiness (cf. Rom. 8:29-30; II Cor. 3:18; Gal. 4:19; Eph. 1:4; 2:10; I Thess. 3:13; 4:3; I Pet. 1:15)., 453870=\u25a3 \"Lord\" The NASB (1970) has \"LORD,\" following some Hebrew manuscripts. Here in v. 3 it is the Hebrew term Adon, which denotes \"owner,\" \"master,\" \"husband\" and is usually translated \"Lord.\" The covenant name YHWH (Lord) does occur in v. 4. It occurs seven times in this chapter and nowhere else in Daniel. The NASB (1995 Update) appropriately has \"Lord\" here in v. 3., 643519=b.\u00a0Greek, 10:20, 298532=6:11 \"came by agreement\" This is the same Aramaic word used in vv. 6 and 15 for their coming before the King., 987203=2.\u00a0religious purposes, Exod. 19:13,16,19; Lev. 25:9; II Sam. 6:15; II Chr. 15:14; Ps. 81:3; 98:6; 150:3, 1079776=12:5 \"A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through. . .their God\" This phrase is understood in several ways., 773237=2:13 \"be silent\" This is an INTERJECTION (BDB 245), not a VERB (cf. Hab. 2:20; Zeph. 1:7). The VERB form is found in Neh. 8:11., 729943=This verse is the reason TEV translates v. 11c in a negative sense. The ADJECTIVE translated \"ease\" (BDB 983) has the added connotation of \"careless, wanton, arrogant\" ease (cf. Ps. 123:4; Isa. 32:9,11; Amos 6:1). This second vision (cf. 1:18-21) expands this theme of God's judgment on the very nations He used to punish His people., 706266=The phrases \"your evil ways\" and \"your evil deeds\" function as a hendiadys. The term \"ways\" is used metaphorically for lifestyle. Biblical faith is (1) personal, (2) creedal, and (3) lifestyle. This lifestyle obedience is expressed early in Gen. 18:19 (cf. Jdgs. 2:22; Ps. 119:1). The related metaphor is \"walk\" (e.g. Prov. 6:20-22; Jer. 7:24; 10:9; Eph. 14:1,17; 5:2,15)., 768998=2:11 \"many nations\" This was a startling message that the Gentiles would be included with God's people (eg. 8:20-23; 14:16; Eph. 2:11-3:13). This was always YHWH's purpose (e.g. Gen. 12:3; Isa. 2:2-4; 11:10; 19:19-22; 24:13-16a; 25:6-7; 42:6-7,10-12; 49:6-23; 51:4; 56:3-8; Mic. 4:1-3). As a Gentile follower of Jesus, the Jewish Messiah, it is hard to put into words the joy this verse brings to my heart!, 34505=A.\u00a0The book states its author in 12:4. Chapters 1-6 are written in the third person, while chapters 7-12 are in the first person, 7:2,15,28; 8:1,15,27; 9:2; 10:2,7,11; 12:5. The use of the third person is common in the ancient world. In the Ten Commandments God moves from the first person (cf. Exod. 20:2) to the third person (cf. Exod. 20:7,8-11). Jesus acknowledges the traditional authorship of Daniel in Matt. 24:15., 415247=8:13 \"I heard a holy one\" This is translated \"saint\" in 7:18,21,22,25 and refers to faithful believers. Here it must refer to the conversation between two angels (cf. possibly 7:27) for Daniel's benefit. Other OT titles for angels are (1) \"sons of God\" (cf. Gen. 6:2; Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7; Ps. 29:1; 89:6-7); (2) \"holy ones\" (cf. Dan. 4:13; Ps. 89:5, 7; Zech. 14:5); (3) \"watchers\" (cf. Dan. 4:13, 17, 23); (4) sometimes \"man\" or \"men\" (cf. 8:15,16; 9:20; 10:5,16,18; 12:6-7; Zech. 1:8,10,19; 2:1,3)., 485226=9:24 \"seventy weeks\" The Hebrew phrase (BDB 988) is literally \"seventy units of seven\" (or weeks). Numerals were usually FEMININE PLURAL, but here they are MASCULINE PLURAL and this is unusual, possibly to denote its symbolic nature. This \"seventy units of seven\" relates to the seventy units of Jeremiah's prophecy noted in v. 2. Daniel is being told that there would be a another longer period in Israel's history when the temple would be destroyed again (similar to Ezek. 38-39), but he was to remember that God was in control of all human history and that He would bring creation to its divine purpose., 649794=12:2 \"those who sleep\" There are several terms in Hebrew for sleep., 547389=3.\u00a0guardian angels (I Enoch 20:5 and DSS texts), 293010=6:6 \"came by agreement to the king\" The VERB (Haphel PERFECT) is rare both in Aramaic and Hebrew. It can mean (1) \"in harmony\"; (2) \"thronged\" (NKJV, JPSOA, BDB 1112); or (3) in the Psalms (cf. 2:1; 55:15) the Hebrew counterpart is used for a treacherous conspiracy, which seems to be the implication here., 968365=3.\u00a0those who form the eschatological people of God (e.g. Amos 9:12; Jer. 23:3; 31:7; Isa. 11:11,16), 798177=3:9 \"the stone. . .one stone\" The identity and purpose of this stone has caused great confusion among interpreters. Some theories are (1) that it relates to the High Priest's breastplate (cf. Exod. 28:15-20; 39:10-14), the stone for Judah; (2) that the Messiah is represented by Zerubbabel (cf. 6:12; Hag. 2:23); (3) that it is the Messianic kingdom (cf. Dan. 2:44-45); (4) that it is a stone set in the miter worn by the High Priest (cf. v. 5); (5) that it is building material for the temple, possibly the cornerstone or capstone (cf. Ps. 118:22-23; Isa. 8:14-15; 28:16); or (6) that it is another Messianic title (servant, branch, stone)., 643461=a.\u00a0Persian, 10:13,20, 1091003=12:11 \"In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo\" There have been many theories to try to describe what is referred to here: (1) the RSV and NRSV translate this as referring to a person; (2) the KJV and NKJV, following Jerome, interpret this to refer to a city located four miles from Megiddo (the site of the end-time battle, cf. vv. 2-9); (3) recent scholars believe that this refers to a Canaanite deity, Ba'al, mentioned in II Kgs. 5:18. This word, \"Hadadrimmon\" is made up of two proper names (one Syrian and one Assyrian) which are used in the OT for ancient deities; or (4) the term is ambiguous. It is possible that it refers to the mourning over Josiah's death at this geographical location (609 b.c., cf. II Kgs. 23:29ff; II Chr. 35:20ff). The exact allusion is uncertain, but great mourning occurred over something and this is simply the illustration used to back up the emphasis of v. 10., 747452=2:2 \"So I said, \u2018Where are you going'\" In Zechariah's visions many people speak., 788236=3:3 \"Joshua was clothed with filthy garments\" This is a Hebrew metaphor for defilement. He was the sinful representative of the chosen people (cf. Isa. 64:6). Even the priesthood and temple were corrupt (cf. Ezek. 8; Jer. 7). \"Filthy\" (BDB 844) refers to ceremonial pollution by human excretion (cf. Deut. 23:9-14), which separated the people from their holy God., 972785=\u25a3 \"Behold, your king is coming to you\" The VERB (BDB 97, KB 112) is a Qal IMPERFECT. This is one of many quotes from this section of Zechariah. It is used in the Gospels for Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem (cf. Matt. 21:5; John 12:15). For the concept of God and the Messiah as King see I Sam. 8:7; 12:12., 304267=6:20 \"\u2018servant of the living God'\" This is a play on the root word \"YHWH,\" which is the CAUSATIVE form of the Hebrew VERB \"to be,\" which implies the \"ever-living, only-living God\" (cf. Exod. 3: 14). See note at 6:6., 383412=\u25a3 \"\u2018my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my face grew pale'\" See note at 4:19 (also 7:15,28; 8:27; 10:16-17)., 411485=This verse refers to the little horn of the third kingdom attacking God's people, as did the little horn of the fourth kingdom in 7:21,25. There is an anti-God force loose in creation. It can be identified by its attack on God's Messiah and God's people!, 66950=1:2 \"the Lord gave. . .God granted. . .God gave\" These phrases are found in verses 2, 9 (both Qal IMPERFECT), and 17 (Qal PERFECT). Each combine to show God's control of history! This is a recurrent theme in Daniel. In the ancient world every army fought under the banner/name of their god. Success in battle showed the supremacy of one god over another. However, the Bible clearly asserts that it was because of Israel's and Judah's sins and rebellion against YHWH that YHWH allowed, yes even engineered, the invasion of the promised land., 1075332=\u25a3 \"to all the peoples around\" This refers to the nations which have attacked God's people (cf. v. 3; Isa. 51:22; Jer. 25:17,28)., 434418=8:25 This fits what we know of Antiochus IV. See also I Maccabees 1:29-41,44-50; 4:38-39., 983356=2.\u00a0the interpreting angel wakes the prophet, 4:1 (twice), 667676=12:11 \"from the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished\" This obviously refers to a historical event. The \"regular sacrifice\" (BDB 556) refers to the daily sacrifice of a lamb, every morning and evening in the temple (\"the continual\"). There has been a diversity of opinions based on the time frame in which the passage is viewed:, 438724=NASB (UPDATED) TEXT:8:27 \u00a027\"Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up again and carried on the king's business; but I was astounded at the vision, and there was none to explain it.\", 892391=\u25a3 \"as I have done these many years\" This again is an allusion to the 70 year prophecy of exile by Jeremiah (cf. 25:8-11; 29:10; Dan. 9:2,24; Zech. 7:5)., 794311=The term \"ways\" (BDB 202) is a Hebrew idiom of lifestyle godliness (cf. 1:6; Josh. 1:8,15a; 45:13; 48:15; Jer. 3:21; 12:1; 23:12; Hos. 10:13; Ezek. 7:3,8,9,27; 14:22-23; 18:25,29,30; 24:14; 33:17,20; 36:19)., 40733=H.\u00a0There is disagreement among OT scholars related to the Dny'L of the book of Daniel and Dn'L of Ezek. 14:14,20; 28:3, who is also mentioned in \"the Aqhat Epic\" in the Ras Shamra (Ugarit) texts., 859382=6:4 This parallels 1:19., 643572=c.\u00a0Jewish, 10:13,21; 12:1, 970360=9:8 \"But I will camp around My house\" The VERB (BDB 333, KB 332) is a Qal PERFECT. This may be an allusion to 2:5 (cf. Ps. 34:8), which speaks of God's protecting His people (cf. Isa. 60:15-22) in a military sense. The Promised Land had been invaded again and again because of its strategic location, but there will come a day when God will personally indwell and protect the Promised Land., 1015301=3.\u00a0for building the tabernacle (cf. Exod. 27:19; 35:18; 38:20,31), 164576=3:2 \"the king sent to assemble\" We have, from Sargon II's records, examples of this same type of royal assembly., 749425=There was no need for physical protection. This was possibly an answer to the nervous critics of Zechariah's day about rebuilding the Temple when there was no way to protect it (i.e. no wall around Jerusalem, cf. Nehemiah). This is the OT source for Rev. 21:25, where the new Jerusalem does not need gates for protection because God is present!, 1130597=\u25a3 \"the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah\" Josephus (Antiq. 9.225) links it with II Chr. 26:16-23, when Uzziah offered a sacrifice and was struck with leprosy. This same earthquake is referred to in Amos 1:1 (i.e. 750 b.c.). This may imply that an earthquake will form the valley, but this is not a certainty. Earthquakes are used to describe God's presence in judgment (cf. Isa. 29:6; Ezek. 38:19)., 608639=11:20 This refers to the reign of Selecus IV Philopator (187-175 b.c.), who, in order to raise money to pay the Romans, assigned a very heavy tax on his own realm (esp. the temple in Jerusalem). His tax collector (NASB, \"an oppressor\"; NKJV, \"one who imposes taxes\"; the Hebrew word [BDB 620] means \"exactor of tribute\") was named Heliodorus (cf. II Macc. 3). Many believe that he poisoned Selecus IV in order to gain control, but he himself was overthrown by Antiochus IV (cf. II Mac. 3:7-40)., 781927=\u25a3 \"Joshua\" This Hebrew name (BDB 221) means \"YHWH saves.\" This is the same as the Aramaic name, Jesus (cf. Matt. 1:21). This particular Joshua was the Zadokian (son of Jehozadak or Jozadak) High Priest who returned in a second wave of returnees with Zerubbabel, a prince of the line of Judah (cf. Hag. 1:1,12,14; 2:2,4; Ezra 2:2; 5:2; Neh. 7:7; 12:1,10,26)., 497974=\u25a3 \"Messiah, the Prince\" This may be \"an anointed, a prince.\" Many scholars and commentators have understood \"anointed one\" to refer to Cyrus II (cf. Isa. 41:2,25; 44:28-45:7; 46:11; 48:15) whom YHWH used to restore His people to the Promised Land. These interpreters then relate vv. 26-27 to the time and activities of Antiochus IV., 13516=4.Some other examples of OT prophetic concepts being expanded are (1) the seed of Abraham is now the spiritually circumcised (cf. Rom. 2:28-29); (2) the covenant people now include Gentiles (cf. Hos. 1:10; 2:23, quoted in Rom. 9:24-26; also Lev. 26:12; Exod. 29:45, quoted in II Cor. 6:16-18 and Exod. 19:5; Deut. 14:2, quoted in Titus 2:14); (3) the temple is now Jesus and through Him the local church (cf. I Cor. 3:16) or the individual believer (cf. I Cor. 6:19); and (4) even Israel and its characteristic descriptive OT phrases now refer to the whole people of God (i.e. \"Israel,\" cf. Rom. 9:6; Gal. 6:16, i.e. \"kingdom of priests,\" cf. I Pet. 2:5, 9-10; Rev. 1:6), 432901=\u25a3 \"and prosper and perform his will\" See note at 8:12., 888046=\u25a3 \"Chislev\" This is a month in the Babylonian calendar (cf. Neh. 1:1), approximately November or December., 361717=7:16 One characteristic of apocalyptic literature is interpreting angels (e.g. 8:16,17; 9:22; Zech. 1:9,19; 2:2,3; 4:4,5,13; 6:4; Rev. 5:5; 7:13). This is another way to show God's sovereignty. No human can know the true interpretation without heaven's help! These visions and dreams are given to communicate inspired truths from God, but they are still under God's control. Only some understand (cf. Isa. 6:9-10; 43:8; Jer. 5:21; Ezek. 12:2; Matt. 11:15; 13:9,43; Mark 4:9,23; Luke 8:8; 14:35; Acts 7:51; 28:27; Rev. 2:7,11,29; 3:6,13,22; 13:9). This is revelation for God's people!, 478660=9:22 \"to give you insight and understanding\" The Hebrew word \"insight\" (BDB 968) is used in several senses., 253359=\u25a3 \"his father\" This could be literal (cf. Gen. 31:42), but probably it is used in the sense of \"ancestor,\" \"descendant\" (cf. Ezra 5:12), or \"previous royal leader\" (BDB 1078, also the black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III calls Jehu \"son of Omri\"). Some examples show the term being used as grandfather (cf. Gen. 28:13; 32:9) and great grandfather (cf. I Kgs. 15:11)., 1062356=11:17 \"Woe\" Less emphatic than (BDB 17) this word (BDB 222) usually introduces a pronouncement of judgment in Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Habukkuk. It is often translated \"Ah\" or \"Alas.\", 845923=\u25a3 \"Shinar\" This is an ancient name for Babylon (BDB 1042, cf. Gen. 10:10; 11:2,4; 14:1; Isa. 11:11,13-14; 47; Jer. 50-51; Dan. 1:2; Rev. 14:8; 16:19; 17:1-7), which is a biblical metaphor for evil. Many relate this to the exilic experience (cf. 2:6-7) and also to those Jews who did not return to Palestine!, 366032=6.\u00a0\"endure forever,\" 2:44c; 6:26, 553116=2.\u00a0Gabriel called \"man\" (geber) in 8:15 and ish in 9:21, 861982=6:7, 376621=This text is the reason why many modern commentators speculate that the fourth kingdom refers to Greece and that this phrase specifically reflects Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164 b.c., cf. I Maccabees 1:41-53; II Maccabees 6:2,6,7) trying to force the Jews of Palestine to become more Hellenistic by drastically changing and modifying their religious traditions and worship practices.}",
