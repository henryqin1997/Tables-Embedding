For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission.

(A Development Stage Company) as of October 31, 2012, and the related statements of operations, stockholders\u0092 equity, and cash flows for the period from inception on August 20, 2012 through October 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America., 384409=October 31, 2012, 130187=We will be required, pursuant to Section\u00a0404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. \u00a0We expect to incur significant continuing costs, including accounting fees and staffing costs, in order to maintain compliance with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Development of our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems, processes and information systems. If our business develops and grows, our current design for internal control over financial reporting will not be sufficient to enable management to determine that our internal controls are effective for any period, or on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, as we develop our business, such development and growth will necessitate changes to our internal control systems, processes and information systems, all of which will require additional costs and expenses., 357598=January 10, 2013, 348915=Statement of Operations \u0096 August 20, 2012 (inception) through \u00a0October 31, 2012, 13863=As filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2013, 209742=Our cash balance is $3,984 as of October 31, 2012.\u00a0\u00a0We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time.\u00a0\u00a0We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Yulia Marach, our Chairman and President, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees.\u00a0\u00a0As of October 31, 2012, Ms. Marach advanced us $117. Ms. Marach, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company.\u00a0In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $40,000 of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. After twelve months period\u00a0we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing.

Ms. Marach intends to devote 15 hours a week of her time to planning and organizing activities of Gelia Group, Corp. Once we expand operations, and are able to attract more customers to purchase our product, Ms. Marach has agreed to commit more time as required. Because Ms. Marach will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to her. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a cessation of operations., 347921=Balance Sheet \u0096 October 31, 2012, 74714=From inception until the date of this filing, we have had limited operating activities.\u00a0\u00a0Our financial statements from inception (August 20, 2012) through October 31, 2012, reports no revenues and a net loss of $133.\u00a0Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Gelia Group, Corp. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.

Further, the finances required to fully develop our plan cannot be predicted with any certainty and may exceed any estimates we set forth.
