As stated in that document, the Coast Guard proposes to disestablish the special anchorage area at the north end of the main channel in Marina del Rey Harbor, California. This proposed action would remove the anchorage area from Coast Guard regulations. This proposed rule would not prevent vessels from anchoring in the harbor during storms, stress, or other emergency situations.
