            "There are some Greek life activities. There is also a Honor Society that requires a GPA of at least 3.75 or better to receive scholarship and transferring opportunities.",
            "This school is great for those who want individual help. Also, for those who don't mind a little traffic and being in the city life. This school provides opportunities for multiple students learning styles.",
            "The main building is completely connected so you never have to go outside if you do not want to be in the elements or weather if you do not want to. There is neat and unusual student art displayed throughout the halls.",
            "The campus is on the main strip of North Canton Ohio. There are plenty of stores, shops, theatres, and attractions to see. The school itself has a walking trail and various activities to join in and participate in.",
            "You need to take the time to do your research and figure out just what you want to study before you start classes. Make sure you have someone you can trust to talk with you about your options and class choices.",
            "I enjoy the smaller classes with one on one teaching. Every professor has been amazing. I enjoy the scaffolding approach to new challenges that Stark State offers."

Though it's a technology college I go for massage therapy. I love my program and the people in it and it's very advanced learning for Ohio. Tips for prospective students Check out everything a school has to offer. From it's classes, teachers, tuition, activities, EVERYTHING. Ask loads of questions and get ever information down on paper so you can take it with you to help remember for later. Don't settle for any college. Set your standards high and strive for great things, no matter the cost. Bang for the buck This school is not a community college. It is a advanced learning atmosphere. Tuition is low but the stuff I learn in my classes is the same things people",
