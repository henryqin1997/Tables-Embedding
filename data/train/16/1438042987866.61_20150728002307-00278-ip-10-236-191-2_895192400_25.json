            "Well, it's in LA so just a bus ride or a 15 minute drive away, there is plenty of activity to jump in to and enjoy.",
            "The school has stores for snacks but no actual place to serve food, but there are plenty of places really close by to go and eat.",
            "There is none, it is a community college without dorms.",
            "The teachers know you, so it pushes you to try harder since you don't get lost in the midst of a giant classroom.",
            "Make sure to register early and to stay on top of scheduling because classes get full quick, which I'm sure is an issue everywhere. Also do research on all the resources and programs ELAC has to offer because it can really help, and get involved as much as possible.",
            "I have had the privilege to attend this college. Despite it being small, the people who work there really try to bring in as many opportunities as possible to ensure a successful college experience. The school has a very welcoming vibe, and it's diverse."
