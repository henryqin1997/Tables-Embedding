    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33861=Following the 2013 season there was a whirlwind of speculation in Eugene about the futures of several star players eligible to leave early for the NFL. The first announcements came from starting quarterback Marcus Mariota (RSo.) and starting center Hroniss Grasu (Jr.), declaring that they would stay at Oregon in order to finish their degrees.[12] Later in the week, defensive leaders Tony Washington (RJr.) and Derrick Malone (Jr.) announced that they too would be staying in Eugene to finish their education., 413516=In winning the Pac-12 Conference Championship the Ducks all but assured themselves of a berth in the inaugural College Football Playoff, the seeding of which will be announced two days after the game on Sunday December 7, 2014., 138268=Entering the 2014 season the Ducks were ranked at number 3 in the AP Preseason Poll and number 4 in the Coaches' Preseason Poll, receiving a first place vote in each. After a dominant performance against South Dakota the Ducks remained at number 3 and number 4 in the AP and USA Today polls respectively, but gained first placed votes in each. Following a decisive victory over #7 Michigan State the Ducks rose to second in the AP poll, while remaining fourth in the USA Coaches Poll. Coming out of a week three victory over Wyoming the Ducks maintained their second place slot in the AP poll and rose to third in USA Today Coaches' Poll, earning first place votes in each., 423533=On January 1, 2015 the Ducks ended the 29-game win streak of the ACC champions Florida State Seminoles in the Rose Bowl, Florida State's first loss since November 24, 2012. Oregon's 59 points were the most ever scored in a Rose Bowl. Their 41 points in the second half were also the most ever scored in one half of a Rose Bowl. The 2015 Rose Bowl served as the semifinal in the inaugural year of the College Football Playoff, by winning the Ducks advance to the College Football Playoff National Championship Game, facing the Ohio State Buckeyes., 35084=The first Duck to declare that he would be leaving school early and pursuing a career in the NFL was starting cornerback Terrance Mitchell (Jr.), many considered it to be a poor decision, and that another year in college would boost his potential draft status. Nonethelesss he was drafted in the seventh round by the Dallas Cowboys and did not end up making the final roster, he was signed by the Chicago Bears as a member of their practice squad prior to the 2014 NFL season.[13], 272604=South Dakota retained possession from the end of the first quarter into the beginning of the second and would finish their drive with a punt, downed at the Oregon 29-yard line.[55] Oregon couldn't get things going on their first possession of the second quarter and had a 3 and out on a negative running play from Thomas Tyner, two incomplete passes and a punt which was returned to the 50-yard line.[55] South Dakota fought back and put together an 8 play, 42-yard drive culminating in a 25-yard field goal, putting the game at 21\u20136 with 9:26 left in the half.[55] The Ducks returned the ensuing kick-off to their own 42 yard line and were in the end-zone 5 plays later after a 26-yard run from Freeman.[55] Oregon then forced the Coyotes to punt, taking possession at their own 46 yard line. Byron Marshall started the drive off by breaking free on a 53-yard run, only to drop the ball in celebration on the 1 yard line, the ball went into the end-zone and then out of bounds, causing a touch-back, giving the Coyotes the ball at their own 20 yard line.[55] Oregon's defense then forced the Coyotes to fumble, which Oregon defensive back Dior Mathis recovered.[55] Oregon turned the fumble into points 5 plays later with a touchdown pass from Mariota to Marshall to put the game at 35\u20136.[55] South Dakota's next drive would be their only drive resulting in a touchdown, they drove the ball 75-yards in 6 plays, finishing with a 3-yard run from Trevor Bouma.[55] The Ducks then recorded the final scoring drive of the first half, going 76-yard on 10 plays, finishing with a 1-yard run from Mariota, only to have the point after attempt fail due to a bad snap.[55] The teams went into the locker rooms at halftime with score at 41\u201313.[55], 123934=The 2014 Pac-12 schedule was officially released on January 8, 2014.[45] Oregon will play against all five North Division schools: California, Oregon State, Stanford, Washington and Washington State. They will also play against four South Division opponents: Arizona, Colorado, UCLA and Utah; they will not play against Arizona State or USC, unless it is for the conference championship. For their non-conference slate the Ducks will play against the South Dakota Coyotes of the Missouri Valley Conference, the 2014 Rose Bowl winners and reigning Big Ten conference champions, the Michigan State Spartans and the Wyoming Cowboys of the Mountain West Conference., 404533=In the 2014 edition of the Civil War, Oregon defeated their in-state rival the Oregon State Beavers in Corvallis, OR 47\u201319 in their seventh straight victory in the 118 year old series. The Ducks extend their lead the all-time series 62-46-10 (.568).[76], 13551=The 2014 Oregon Ducks football team represented the University of Oregon in the 2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The team was led by second-year head coach Mark Helfrich and played their home games at Autzen Stadium for the 48th straight year. They were a member of the Pacific-12 Conference in the North Division., 14300=The Oregon Ducks finished the season with 13\u20132 overall and 8\u20131 in Pac\u201312 play. The Ducks won the Pac-12 North Division for the second time since the division's creation in 2011, advancing to the Pac-12 Football Championship Game, where they defeated the Arizona Wildcats 51\u201313. The Ducks played in the inaugural College Football Playoff, netting a berth in the 2015 Rose Bowl semifinal game, where they defeated the Florida State Seminoles 59\u201320, advancing to the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship game facing the Ohio State Buckeyes. This was Oregon's second-ever national championship game appearance (their first was the 2011 BCS National Championship Game, in which they lost to Auburn). They were defeated in the National Championship by Ohio State by a score of 42\u201320. The Ducks finished the season as consensus national runners-up behind the national champion Buckeyes and ahead of Peach Bowl victors TCU., 319820=The Ducks extended their lead in the series to 49-36-7 (.571), as well as continuing their current win streak to eight consecutive years.[61] They would travel home facing a bye week in which to work on inconsistencies and heal followed by a Thursday night game against the Arizona Wildcats, a team they lost to in 2013., 386592=By winning this game the Ducks won the Pac-12 North Division, guaranteeing themselves a spot in 2014 Pacific-12 Football Championship Game, they are the first team to win the Pac-12 North Division title outright, and have been co-champions in all other years., 350696=The Ducks scored again early in the fourth quarter on another Royce Freeman run, this time from just two yards out making the score 42-10.[68] UCLA responded with a 93 yard drive ending a touchdown complete with a two-point conversion, reducing their deficit to 42-18 with just under ten minuted to go.[68] The Ducks put in their second string and tried to run out the clock, however UCLA forced a punt and almost succeeded in achieving what would have been one of the greatest comebacks in school history.[68] With eight minutes left in the game the Bruins drove 67 yards in three minutes, scored a touchdown and missed two-point attempt making the score 42-24 with 4:21 left to play.[68] The Bruins then recovered an onside kick and again completed a quick scoring drive, missing the two-point attempt to make the score 42-30 with 2:47 to go.[68] The Bruins were unable to recover their next onside kick and with their time outs exhausted by the previous drives they were unable to stop the Ducks from running out the clock, leaving the final score 42-30.[68], 147040=Oregon head coach Mark Helfrich returns in his second year as Oregon's head coach following what many have considered to be a disappointing debut season, even though he earned 11 wins, including a bowl game victory, something never before achieved by a first year Oregon head coach.[47] Following the retirement of longtime defensive coordinator & outside linebackers coach Nick Aliotti at the end of the 2013 season Oregon promoted veteran inside linebackers coach and University of Oregon alumni Don Pellum to the defensive coordinator position (he would maintain the inside linebackers coach position).[48] To fill the opening at outside linebackers coach Oregon hired former graduate assistant Erik Chinander who at the time was working for the Philadelphia Eagles.[49], 335101=The Ducks maintain their lead the all-time series 24-16 (.600), however, every victory earned by the Wildcats since 2007 has been a major upset of the Ducks with each win coming over an Oregon team ranked in the top ten at the time of the game (2007 #2; 2013 #10; 2014 #2).[64] The main storyline following the game continued to be the Ducks beleaguered offensive line, allowing Mariota to be sacked five times during the game, and unable to effectively run block or fight back against a three man pass rush.[65], 246208=Roster Last update: 11:12, 12 August 2014 (UTC), 378109=In their ninth game the Ducks defeated the Stanford Cardinal in Eugene, winning over the Cardinal for the first time since 2011. The Cardinal maintain their lead the all-time series 46\u201331\u20131 (.596).[73], 500161=The following members of 2014 Oregon Ducks football team were selected in the 2015 NFL Draft.[83], 313034=In their first conference game of the 2014 season the Ducks narrowly defeated the Washington State Cougars in Pullman, WA 38-31. Washington State won the coin toss, elected to receive and were forced into a three-and-out on their first drive.[60] The Ducks came out of the gate sloppily, punting on their first drive gaining negative yardage and allowing Marcus Mariota to be sacked.[60] The rest of the first half was a story of the Cougars scoring after long drives, often doing so by making the Oregon defense look terrible against the pass in the process, and Oregon responding with one or two play scoring drives, often taking less than one minute to complete.[60] By the end of the half the score was tied at 21, with time of possession heavily skewed in the Cougars favor nearly two to one.[60] Washington State appeared to be succeeding at a tried and true method of defeating the Ducks: sustaining long offensive drives and achieving crippling penetration of the offensive line. With backups at left and right tackle, Marcus Mariota had been sacked five times in the first half.[60], 437470=As of 1/1/2015., 361044=In winning their sixth game of the season the Ducks became bowl eligible for the tenth consecutive year, tied for tenth in longest active consecutive bowl appearances. The Ducks have played in a bowl game 19 times since the 1989[71] season with a record of 9-10 (.474), having missed the postseason only four times (1991, 1993, 1996 & 2004)., 27591=As they have done in every case of hiring a new head coach since 1995, the Ducks hired from within and promoted fourth year offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mark Helfrich to the head coach position. Along with the head coach change, wide receivers coach Scott Frost was promoted to offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, Duke wide receivers coach Matt Lubick and Arizona Cardinals defensive line coach Ron Aiken were hired to fill their respective positions on Oregon\u2019s staff.[4][5][6], 114014=On May 3, 2014, Oregon capped off its spring football camp with a scrimmage at Autzen Stadium that was open to the public and broadcast live on the Pac-12 Network. The Monday before the game, team captains were selected followed by a draft. Quarterback Marcus Mariota and center Hroniss Grasu captained team \"Mariasu\" which was coached by the offensive coordinator Scott Frost and the other offensive coaches. Defensive end Tony Washington and cornerback Ifo Ekpre-Olomu captained team \"Twifo\" which was coached by defensive coordinator Don Pellum and the other defensive coaches; head coach Mark Helfrich observed the game from the field.[40][41], 488205=The Ducks had 10 players honored as members of the 2014 Pac-12 All-Conference team, with five each on the first and second teams, respectively. Four other Ducks earned honorable mention honors., 412524=On December 5, 2014 the Ducks won their 12th Pacific-12 Conference Championship by defeating the Arizona Wildcats, the only team to defeat the Ducks this so far in the season, 51\u201313 in the 2014 Pacific-12 Football Championship Game. The Ducks snapped a two-game losing streak against the Wildcats, extending their lead in the overall series to 25-16 (.610). Winning this game gives Oregon their 12th win on the year, their fourth 12-win season in the last five years., 28694=Oregon would start the season ranked[7] third behind Ohio State and Alabama, and would rise to second after their first game, a 66\u20133 win over Nicholls State in Week 1. They would continue their winning ways, posting double-digit wins over Virginia, Tennessee, California, Colorado, Washington, Washington State and UCLA, and eventually found themselves in a duel with Florida State over the number 2 spot in the BCS poll, with Alabama at number 1. The wheels came off though, as they did the year previously, against Stanford, losing 26\u201320 on the road. The Ducks would rebound with a home win over Utah, but lose again at home to Arizona, the Ducks\u2019 first loss to an unranked foe since 2009., 317178=Going into the fourth quarter ahead 28-21, the Ducks were still very much fighting to maintain ahead of the Cougars. The quarter began with a 30-yard field goal made by Washington State, only to be responded to by a 34-yard field goal from the Ducks.[60] Washington State then drove the length of the field and scored, tying the game again, at 31.[60] Oregon responded with the final scoring drive of the game with a touchdown pass from Mariota to Keanon Lowe, putting the Ducks up by a touchdown with 5:33 to go in the game.[60] After two completions by the Cougars the Oregon defense bowed their necks, not allowing another play of positive yardage, and sacking the Cougars quarterback Connor Halliday on fourth down, giving the Oregon offense the ball, with the lead, and 3:34 on the clock.[60] The Ducks then ran out the clock, and returned home with a hard fought win, and serious questions about their offensive line, and defensive secondary.[60], 431632=Following victories in their respective bowl games on January 1, the No. 2 Ducks and the No. 4 Buckeyes advanced to face each other in the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship at AT&T Stadium. Coming into the game, Oregon had never beaten Ohio State, holding an 0\u20138 all-time record against the Buckeyes., 500803=Seven members of the 2014 team were invited to participate in drills at the 2015 NFL scouting Combine., 31940=On December 8, 2013 the Ducks were invited to play in the Alamo Bowl against Texas in what would be Texas head coach Mack Brown and Oregon defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti's last games before retiring. Oregon won the Alamo bowl 30\u20137, tying a school record set from 1999 to 2001 for consecutive bowl wins at three, with rookie head coach Mark Helfrich becoming the first Oregon head coach to go to and win a bowl game in his rookie year (Rich Brooks won his first bowl game, after 12 years as head coach at Oregon, Mike Belloti and Chip Kelly each went to and lost a bowl game in their first years). Oregon finished the season at 11\u20132, only their fifth season with 11 or more wins in 118 years of football.[8][9][10][11], 46236=\u2020 - Colt Lyerla left the team in September 2013 after missing game time due to suspension and illness. After leaving the team Lyerla was arrested for use and possession of cocaine. After the season Lyerla participated in the NFL Combine as well as Oregon's Pro Day., 26433=The Ducks had high hopes coming off of a 12\u20131 (8\u20131) season a victory in the 2013 Fiesta Bowl, many considered them a contender for the BCS national championship game the following year.[1] However, these hopes were thrown into question shortly after their Fiesta Bowl victory, on January 16, 2013. Head coach Chip Kelly announced that he had agreed to terms with the Philadelphia Eagles to become their new head coach after several disappointing seasons under Andy Reid; Kelly brought Oregon defensive line coach Jerry Azzinaro along with him to Philadelphia.[2][3]}",
