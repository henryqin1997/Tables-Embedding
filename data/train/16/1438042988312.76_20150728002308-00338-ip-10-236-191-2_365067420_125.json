The highest nominal value for medium-complexity codec configurations is 80 ms., 68715=When the playout-delay mode is configured for fixed operation and setting the expected jitter buffer size with the nominal value, the minimum effective value for the playout delay will depend on the codec in use and the configured minimum value., 90884=Playout delay is the amount of time that elapses between the time at which a voice packet is received at the jitter buffer on the DSP and the time at which it is played out to the codec. In most networks with normal jitter conditions, the defaults are adequate and you will not need to configure the playout-delay command., 489052=This command was implemented on the Cisco 2600 and Cisco 3600 series routers., 145838=This command was implemented on the Cisco 2600 series., 391716=This command was implemented on the Cisco 1750., 75040=DSPware version 4.1.33 was implemented., 67534=For medium-complexity codec configurations, the highest nominal value is 150 ms., 63949=Range is from 40 to 1700, although this value depends on the type of DSP and how the voice card is configured for codec complexity. (See the codec complexity command.) Default is 200., 76273=Playout delay is the amount of time that elapses between the time at which a voice packet is received at the jitter buffer on the DSP and the time at which it is played out to the codec. In most networks with normal jitter conditions, the defaults are adequate and you will not need to configure this command., 131419=The following example sets a neighbor BE to port number 2010., 467986=Configures the Cisco 2600 series router PRI interface to support QSIG signaling., 81646=codec complexity, 514104=cdrtest1.cme-2821.06_04_2007_18_44_51.785, 166358=To specify the serial interface to which the local video codec is connected for a local video dial peer, use the port media command in video dial-peer configuration mode. To remove any configured locations from the dial peer, use the no form of this command., 239207=Delay, in milliseconds. Range is from 0 to 1000., 511740=For example, if you specify the filename cdrtest1 on a router with the hostname cme-2821, a file is created with the name cdrtest1.cme-2821.2007_10_28T22_21_41.000, where 2007_10_28T22_21_41.000 is the time that the file was created., 66727=Range is from 0 to 1500, although this value depends on the type of DSP and how the voice card is configured for codec complexity. Default is 60., 127655=Port number of the neighbor. This number is used for exchanging Annex G messages. The default port number is 2099., 183021=Specifies the serial interface to which the local video codec is connected., 81839=Specifies call density and codec complexity based on the codec standard you are using., 351491=codec (dial-peer), 167860=Serial interface to which the local codec is connected. Valid entries are 0 and 1., 344711=This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.0(3)T and implemented on the Cisco 2600 series and Cisco 3600 series routers., 466209=In the following example, the rlm-timeslot keyword automatically creates interface serial 4/7:11 (4/7:0:11 if you are using the CT3 card) for the D channel object on a Cisco AS5350. You can choose any timeslot other than 24 to be the virtual container for the D channel parameters for ISDN.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Command Modes Voice-class configuration mode (config-class) Command History Release Modification 15.1(2)T This command was introduced. Usage Guidelines Use the periodic-report interval command to periodically report the status of the monitoring resources to the external entity. The triggering takes place based on the preconfigured interval value. You can use the statistics collected by this method of reporting to collect information on resource usage. Examples The following example shows how to configure a resource group to trigger reporting every 180 seconds:  Router> enable Router# configure terminal Router(config)# voice class resource-group 1 Router(config-class)# periodic-report interval 180 Related Commands Command Description debug rai",
