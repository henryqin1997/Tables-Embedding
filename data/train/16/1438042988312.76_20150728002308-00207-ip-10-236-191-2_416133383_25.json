Wallace as frontispiece. Edwin John Dove Pratt (1882-1964) was considered by some to be the greatest Canadian poet\u00a0in the 1st half of the 20th Century. This is his famous blank verse epic poem about St Jean de Brebeuf, one of the North American Jesuit Martyrs. Northrop Frye considered the work to be ' the foremost cultural tragic theme of the Canadian imagination'.
