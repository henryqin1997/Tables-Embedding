            "Description",
            "Bearing for Wheel with Sensor - To provide a sensor incorporated wheel support bearing assembly, in which a load sensor can be compactly installed in an automotive vehicle, the load acting on the vehicle wheel can be detected with high sensitivity and the manufacturing cost can be reduced, the bearing assembly having a plurality of rows of rolling elements interposed between an outer member and an inner member includes a sensor unit fitted to one of the outer member and the inner member, which serves as a stationary member. The sensor unit includes a sensor mounting member and a strain sensor fitted thereto. The sensor mounting member has two contact fixing portions fixed to the outer member and a first contact fixing portion is fixed to a flange surface of the outer member and a second contact fixing portion is fixed to a peripheral surface of the outer member.",
            "SENSOR-EQUIPPED BEARING FOR WHEEL - There is provided a sensor equipped wheel support bearing assembly with rolling elements interposed between outer and inner members and with a strain sensor fixed to a stationary member served by one of the outer and inner members. The strain sensor includes a strain generating member and a sensor element secured thereto. The strain generating member has first and second contact fixing segments respectively associated with a flanged face provided in the outer member and a peripheral surface of the stationary member. These contact fixing segments have a joint region therebetween having a bent portion convexed toward the outer member. A location in the strain generating member where the sensor element is secured is on the first contact fixing segment side of the bent portion and yet in the vicinity of the bent portion.",
            "SENSOR-EQUIPPED BEARING FOR WHEEL - To provide a sensor equipped wheel support bearing assembly, in which a load sensor can be installed compactly in an automotive vehicle, maintaining a high sensitivity while damage and/or malfunction caused by the external environments and/or the electromagnetic noises are avoided, with low manufacturing cost. This bearing assembly includes outer and inner members having respective rolling surfaces and a plurality of rows of rolling elements interposed between those rolling surfaces. A strain sensor unit including a sensor element is fitted to one of the outer and inner members, which is a stationary member, for example, the outer member. A sensor mounting surface of the strain sensor unit fitted with the sensor element has a covering member made of a resin, which is over-molded, or an elastomer bonded by vulcanization, so as to cover the sensor element sealingly.",
            "WHEEL BEARING DEVICE WITH ROTATION SENSOR - Intended is to prevent an output cable of a magnetic sensor, even if tensed, from coming out of a sensor unit. The output cable",
            "SENSOR-EQUIPPED BEARING FOR WHEEL - A sensor-equipped wheel support bearing assembly capable of accurately estimating a load acting on a wheel, without the detecting accuracy deteriorated as a result of a long term use and/or a change in environment, is provided. The assembly includes a sensor unit provided in an outer member, which serves as a stationary member. The sensor unit has a strain generator and a sensor for detecting a strain occurring in the generator. A principal load estimator estimates the load acting on the wheel, with the use of an average value of a signal from the sensor, and an amplitude processed load estimator estimates the load, using amplitude of a signal wave outputted from the sensor, resulting from passage of rolling elements. A drift amount estimator estimates a drift amount of an estimated load output utilizing the average value and the amplitude, which is used to correct the estimated load.",
            "ROTATION DETECTING DEVICE AND BEARING EQUIPPED WITH ROTATION DETECTING DEVICE - A rotation detecting device, which is compatible regardless of whether a process control device for processing an output signal of the rotation detecting device is standard one or new one having high input signal resolving power, and, also, a rotation detecting device equipped bearing assembly having such rotation detecting device, are provided. The rotation detecting device includes an encoder provided rotatably and having a plurality of circumferentially equidistantly arranged to-be-detected poles, and a sensor for detecting the to-be-detected poles. The use is made of a multiplying unit for multiplying the phase of the to-be-detected poles from an output of the sensor. The use is also made of a pulse outputting unit for receiving an output of the multiplying unit or both the output of the multiplying unit and an output of the sensor and output pulses having two multiplying powers different from each other."
