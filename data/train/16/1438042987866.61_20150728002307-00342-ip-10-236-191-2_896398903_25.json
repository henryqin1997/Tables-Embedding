    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I love the friendly enviornment UW-Waukesha has to offer. All of the staff is extremely helpful and encouraging. The people are very nice and it is really an opportunity to grow as an individual and as a team player. I was never involved in high school, but I jumped right into two clubs my first year at Waukesha, I was even an officer my first semester! Am learning a lot I attend UW-Waukesha and the professors there have really opened my mind to the variety of ways one can study a topic. Also, the class sizes are small so if you have any questions you feel comfortable asking. Thirdly, there are many free tutoring options available to really help you learn and better understand the material.
