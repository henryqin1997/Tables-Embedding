            "LED ACTUATING DEVICE AND METHOD - An LED actuating device comprises an LED actuating module, the LED actuating module comprises a micro-programmed control unit (MCU), a VF-value detection module, an actuator and an LED lamp unit; the MCU receives the VF value detected by the VF-value detection module; when the VF value is greater than or equal to a first boundary value, the LED lamp unit is actuated to operate in the constant current area at the first constant actuating current by the actuator; when the VF value is less than the first boundary value, the LED lamp unit is actuated to operate in the regulation area at the continuous step-down actuating current by the actuator until the VF is equal to the second boundary value, and the second boundary value is less than the first boundary value.",
            "LED ACTUATING DEVICE AND METHOD - An actuating device comprises an LED actuating module. Said LED actuating module comprises a micro-programmed control unit (MCU), an actuator, a VF-value detection module, a PN-junction temperature acquisition module and an LED lamp unit. The MCU determines the current value matched with the LED lamp unit based on the VF value detected by the VF-value detection module and the temperature value detected by the PN-junction temperature acquisition module, and then determines the width of the PWM pulse output to the actuator according to the current value, and the actuator actuates an LED to operate at the matched current value."

At first, two gate stack layers are formed on a semiconductor substrate, wherein each of the gate stack layers includes a top surface and two side surfaces. A conductive material layer is deposited to conformally cover the top surface and the two side surfaces of each of the gate stack layers. Then, a cap layer is deposited to conformally cover the conductive material layer. Finally, the cap layer and the conductive material layer above the top surface of each of the gate stack layers are removed to leave the cap layer adjacent to the two side surfaces of each of the gate stack layers and covering a portion of the conductive material layer. 20150014761 Published Description Patent application number Ping Liu, Singapore SG 01-23-2014 ANCHOR FOR SECURING A SUTURE - An improved anchor to secure a suture relative to body tissue. The anchor including an a generally cylindrical body portion with an opening, that is at least in part threaded, extending from the trailing end toward the leading end, and a suture passage configured for passing at least a portion of the suture therethrough. The anchor also includes a trapping member that is configured to be threadably inserted into the opening to trap at least a portion of the suture between trapping",
