    "textBeforeTable": "<!ELEMENT dsig:Algorithm ( dsig:Parameter* )> \u00a0 <!ATTLIST dsig:Algorithm The Algorithm element consists of a basic data type that uniquely identifies a given algorithm and indicates the parameter values to be used during computation. The construct is recursive and allows a parameter value to refer to another Algorithm element. 5.1 Algorithm 5. Detailed Signature Syntax This recursive construct is expected to be more versatile and shall provide a solution applicable to the definition of algorithms in general. However, this definition does not preclude the adoption of shortcuts such as the ones proposed by ASN1. It does not preclude either the adoption of default parameter values. The most noticeable difference with ASN1 consists of the assimilation of sub-algorithms as parameters of the primary algorithm. In other words, where ASN1 recognizes an algorithm of the type AlgxWithAlgy (i.e. DsaWithSha1) the current specifications recognize Algx with an Algy parameter. This specification adopts a unique Algorithm data type. Though noticeably different from its ASN1 counterpart, this data type serves a similar purpose and provides for the definition of algorithm-specific parameters. 4.5 Algorithm Definitions To facilitate the adoption of common procedures for the encoding of attribute and parameter values, this specification defines a series of elements not directly mandated by the Signature DTD.",
