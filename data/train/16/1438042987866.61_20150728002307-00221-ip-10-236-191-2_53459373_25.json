There was plenty of Jones-Drew, Deji Karim and a 13-yard toss from Gabbert to Marcedes Lewis. The Ravens held before the end zone, and Scobee booted through a 22- yard chip shot for the nine-point edge just over midway through the third. The drive went 17 plays for 76 yards and ate up 8 1/2 minutes of the clock., 76174=The Ravens finally got into a rhythm thanks to a no-huddle look. A 13-play, 90-minute march featured three underneath throws to Rice, including an 11-yard completion just before a 20-yard connection down the right sideline to Torrey Smith. Flacco then found Boldin, who tip-toed near the back end line for a five-yard score with 2:02 to go., 73641=Jacksonville got the boost it needed early, recovering a Rice rarity. The Baltimore back lost a fumble in a regular-season game for the first time since December 27, 2009, spanning 522 touches, giving the Jaguars prime field position., 75839=Baltimore registered its initial first down on the next possession when Rice ran off the right side for 12 yards on 3rd-and-1. Flacco found Boldin for 14 yards later in the march, but he took a sack that pushed the Ravens to the back edge of field goal range, and Billy Cundiff's 52-yard attempt missed badly to the right.}",
