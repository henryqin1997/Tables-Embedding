From 1993 to 1997 he was a regular part of the county's one-day side, and he retired at the end of 1999 which he had played on a one-day-only contract. He played one season with Norfolk in 2000 but at the same time started umpiring, joining the English first-class panel in 2002. By 2004 he was officiating as the third official in internationals, and in 2005 he stood in the first Twenty20 international in England. In 2006 he was added to the ECB's list of international officials.
