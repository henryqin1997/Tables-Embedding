When you save it, instead of saving it as a .txt file, save it as a .wps file. Example: Instead of Rockbox.txt, save the file as Rockbox.wps. To make sure non english characters display correctly in your WPS you must save the .wps file with UTF-8 character encoding. This can be done in most editors, for example Notepad in Windows 2000 or XP (but not in 9x/ME) can do this.}",
