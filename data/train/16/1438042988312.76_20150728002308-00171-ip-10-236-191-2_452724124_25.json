Some system properties are linked to their backing table. For example, the acl property is linked to the FXS_ACL table, so you can select any column in that table using a field suffix: acl.description selects the description column, and acl.color returns the color code.

That is, filters are applied every time the search query is executed, and are not stored in the cached result tables. This means that changing filters usually does not invalidate the query cache, whereas changing the WHERE clause always does. Filters applicable to the [fleXive] content table: TYPE=type Return only contents of the given type. You may specify either the type name (e.g. \"ARTICLE\") or the type ID (e.g. \"2\").

Restrict results to languages contained in the comma separated list of language IDs. General filters: BRIEFCASE=briefcaseId[,briefcaseId]?
