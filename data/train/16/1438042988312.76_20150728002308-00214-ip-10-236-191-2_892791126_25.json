I started my classes in August of this year and I'm amazed at how much I have accomplished., 46477=I just started attending this school this year (January). So far, the two teachers I have taken a class with have been very nice and helpful. I met with an adviser once who was quite nice as well, but not real knowledgeable about the field of study I wish to enter (marine biology). Truthfully for the money, it is a pretty good college so far. I plan to pick back up with classes in January., 365852=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 212702=There is also something going on at Pasco-Hernando Community College. For example, this being the month of October, PHCC is holding a trick or treat day for your kids and/or siblings. There is always free food and games to play held by the many clubs here at PHCC.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students If you are pursuing a career that has a limited access program, such as LPN or RN, I would suggest living in the same county as the college. I had a 4.0 GPA and lived close to the county line of Pasco County, but lived in Hillsborough County and did not get into their program, only because I did not live in their county. I am currently pursuing other colleges because of this issue. I only wish that the college would have stressed this issue to me earlier. Other than that, this is a good college. Tips for prospective students This is a good college. Colleagues are friendly and supportive. Most teachers are passionate about teaching their classes. Staff is very helpful. The classes are easy to find.
