Materials and Methods: Mouse GV oocytes were considered in cumulus-denuded oocytes (CDOs) and cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) groups. Their survival and developmental rates were studied in the following experiments: (I) exposure to different equilibration times (0, 3 and 5 minutes) and vitrification (1, 3 and 5 minutes) without plunging in LN2 as toxicity tests, (II) oocytes were vitrified using straws followed by exposure to equilibration solution for 0, 3 and 5 minutes and vitrification solution for 1 and 3 minutes, and (III) oocytes were vitrified by cryotop following exposure to equilibration for 5 minutes and vitrification for 1 minute, respectively. Results: Maturation and developmental rates of the COCs were higher than CDOs in the nonvitrified group (p<0.05). The survival and maturation rates were low in all oocytes exposed to vitrification solution for 5 minutes (p <0.05). In vitrified CDOs and COCs using straws, the survival rates ranged from 56.9% to 85.4% and 44.0% to 84.5%, and the maturation rates from 35.3%",
