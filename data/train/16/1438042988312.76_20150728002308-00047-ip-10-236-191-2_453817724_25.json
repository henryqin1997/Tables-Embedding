            "Distributed multi-channel cognitive mac protocol - A method includes sending a message from a first cognitive radio apparatus to at least one second cognitive radio apparatus, the message being sent over a first communication channel and containing an advertisement of at least one second communication channel for use in sending data from the first cognitive radio apparatus to the at least one second cognitive radio apparatus. The method further includes receiving a reply from the at least one second cognitive radio apparatus over the first communication channel, where the reply contains one of an acceptance of one of the at least one second communication channels, a rejection of the at least one second communication channel and an advertisement of at least one third communication channel, or a rejection of the at least one second communication channel without an advertisement of at least one third communication channel. The method further includes transmitting the data from the first cognitive radio apparatus to the at least one second cognitive radio apparatus over an agreed upon one of the second or third channels.",
            "Radio Resource Management In Mobile Communication Network Employing Private Base Stations - There is provided a solution for reusing radio resources opportunistically by private base stations to increase the overall capacity of the network. The solution is based on applying an uplink broadcast in a mobile communication, in which information representing a radio resource allocated by a base station to a user terminal is broadcasted.",
            "Methods and Apparatus For Handover Management - Systems and techniques for handover management between adjacent cells. A base station, such as a macro base station serving a macro cell identifies a user device as a candidate for handover based on specified criteria and communicates a handover request to a femto base station. The femto base station evaluates specified conditions, such as energy efficiency, for the cell it is serving and allows the handover only if the handover would improve the conditions.",
            "DISTRIBUTED MULTI-CHANNEL COGNITIVE MAC PROTOCOL - A method includes sending a message from a first to at least one second cognitive radio apparatus to determine a channel to be used for sending data from the first to the second radio apparatus, the message sent over a first channel and comprising an advertisement of at least one second channel for use in sending the data from the first to the second radio apparatus, the advertisement comprising a corresponding proposition/evaluation bit for each second channel, receiving a reply from the second radio apparatus over the first channel, comprising an acceptance of one of the second channels with the corresponding proposition/evaluation bit, a rejection of the second channel and an advertisement of a third channel, or a rejection of the second channel without an advertisement of a third channel, and transmitting the data from the first to the second radio apparatus over an agreed upon second or third channel."

An SBS board product is formed without being processed by a Yankee dryer or a wet-stack calendar, and further comprises a plurality of fiber plies, including outermost plies forming the top and back sides and comprised of bleached chemical pulp, and medial plies disposed between the outermost plies and comprised of pulp and/or broke. The SBS board is precalendered with a surface conditioning device and then the top side coated at least once such that the coated SBS board product has a density of between about 500 kg/m 20080251223 Published Description Patent application number Matti Lares, Helsinki FI 05-28-2009 Device and A method for producing a diffractive microstructure - Micro-protrusions, which constitute a diffractive microstructure, are produced by embossing the surface layer of a substrate by an embossing member having microgrooves in such a way that the cross-sectional area of a produced micro-protrusion is substantially smaller than the cross-sectional area of the microgroove producing said micro-protrusion. Thus, the embossing pressure is small, the risk of adhesion is reduced, it is possible to use a low embossing temperature, and microstructures may be produced at a high speed. Furthermore, the same embossing member may be used for producing a low microstructure, a normal microstructure, and a high microstructure. 20090134534 10-23-2008",
