Northshore was one such player. Faulk, who can be considered a strong LSU lean at this point, posted several impressive marks, including a 5.24 SPARQ-timed 40, a 27.2-inch vertical, 21 reps on the bench and a 41-foot, six-inch powerball throw, one of the day's five-best. Look for Faulk to be one of Louisiana's top recruits in the Class of 2009.}",

Lockett is the younger brother of Ole Miss' Kentrell Lockett and lists the Rebels along with Mississippi State as two of his early favorites. Junior linebacker Lamin Barrow out of Marrero John Ehret had a great season this fall and showed on Saturday he has the athletic ability to be a big-time recruit.
