In such an embodiment, the light systems 102 can include an input port 1104 and an export port 1108. The network information may be communicated to the first light system 102 and the first light system 102 may read the information that is addressed to it and pass the remaining portion of the information on to the next light system 102. A person with ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that there are other network topologies that are encompassed by a system according to the principles of the present invention.}",

The placement of the lights may not be as important as the surface the lights are directed towards. It may be this surface that reflects the illumination or lights back to the environment and as a result it may be this surface that is the most important for the mapping program.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations OVERALL_GAMMA can have a value of 0-1. This value is read into DirectLights and can be changed during run-time. MAX_LIGHTS can be as high as 170 for each DMX universe. Each DMX universe is usually a single physical connection to the computer (COM1, for example). The larger MAX_LIGHTS is, the slower the lights will respond, as MAX_LIGHTS determines the size of the buffer sent to DMX (MAX_LIGHTS*3) Obviously, larger buffers will take longer to send. The positional values are in meters. Z is into/out of the plane of the monitor. X is vertical in the plane of the monitor, Y is horizontal in the plane of the monitor. The lower lights on the left and right side of the monitor are indicators 0 and 2, the middle light on the left side of the monitor is indicator 1. Each line in the \u201cmy_lights\u201d file represents one Real_Light. Each Real_Light instance represents, surprise surprise, one real-world light. This example file is taken from our offices, where we had lights setup around a computer, with the following lights (referenced from someone sitting at the monitor): One overhead (mostly ambient); one on each side of our head (Left and Right); one behind our head; Three each along the top, left and right side of the monitor in front of us.",
