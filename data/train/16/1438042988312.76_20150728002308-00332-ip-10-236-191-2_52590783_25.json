His 5-yard touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas with 13 seconds left in the half gave him 5,477 yards., 75271=Manning had four touchdown passes, extending his own record to 55 for the season against just 10 interceptions. Last week against Houston, the four-time NFL MVP broke Brady's old record of 50 touchdown passes for New England in 2007., 75517=The AFC West-champion Broncos raced past those same 2007 Patriots to break the NFL record for most points scored in a season, doing it on Manning's 63-yard touchdown pass to Thomas earlier in the second quarter., 76435=The Raiders (4-12) ended the season on a six-game losing streak. They haven't finished better than .500 in the last 11 seasons since going 11-5 in 2002 on the way to a Super Bowl appearance., 77451=Their offense crackled anyway. Manning threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Eric Decker with 7:05 remaining in the first quarter, then a 7-yarder to Knowshon Moreno just 86 seconds later after Pryor fumbled.}",
