He quickly developed into a major force in the top order and, when Ronnie Irani stood down mid-way through the 2007 season, Pettini was handed the captaincy. In the same month he was nominated in England's provisional World Twenty20 squad., 51498=That and leading Essex to the 2008 Friends Provident Trophy were the high points for Pettini, however, as his form suffered to the extent that he gave up the captaincy in 2010 to save his batting. The following season saw him in and out of the four-day side but he showed signs of a renaissance in 2012, with some gritty innings in difficult conditions. These were rewarded by a new two-year contract. Since 2011, Pettini has had successful spells wintering with Mountaineers in Zimbabwe as an overseas player, as well as playing in the Dhaka Premier League.
