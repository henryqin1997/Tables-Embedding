An operator must reassess a covered segment on which a baseline assessment is conducted during the baseline period specified in \u00a7192.921(d) by no later than seven years after the baseline assessment of that covered segment unless the evaluation under paragraph (b) of this section indicates earlier reassessment., 263894=[35 FR 13257, Aug. 19, 1970, as amended by Amdt. 192\u201334, 44 FR 42973, July 23, 1979; Amdt. 192\u201358, 53 FR 1635, Jan. 21, 1988; Amdt. 192\u201361, 53 FR 36793, Sept. 22, 1988; 58 FR 14521, Mar. 18, 1993; Amdt. 192\u201378, 61 FR 28784, June 6, 1996; Amdt. 192\u2013114, 75 FR 48603, Aug. 11, 2010], 626752=[68 FR 69817, Dec. 15, 2003, as amended by Amdt. 192\u201395, 69 FR 18234, Apr. 6, 2004], 631571=General.
