This provides a useful starting point that you can then modify as desired. This document describes the keys in a configuration profile and provides examples of the resulting XML payloads. Devices can be supervised when preparing them for deployment with Apple Configurator (iOS 5 or later) or by using the Device Enrollment Program (iOS 7 or later). When a device is supervised, you can use profiles to control more of its settings. For more information about the Device Enrollment Program, visit Apple\u2019s iPad in Business or IT in the Classroom pages. Both iOS and OS X support using encryption to protect the contents of profiles. Profiles can also be signed to guarantee data integrity. To learn about encrypted profile delivery, read Over-the-Air Profile Delivery and Configuration. Over the air using a Mobile Device Management Server Using over-the air configuration as described in Over-the-Air Profile Delivery and Configuration On a webpage In an email message Using Apple Configurator (iOS only) There are five ways to deploy configuration profiles: Configuration profiles are in property list format, with Data values stored",
