At a display brightness level of 327.4 cd/m\u00b2, the Miix 2's display is easily visible. Still, the\u00a0Venue 11\u00a0can trump this good number (369.7 cd/m\u00b2).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{327132=The Miix 2 ends the WLAN test after 4:44 h. Once again, the Venue offers a substantially longer battery runtime (6:42 h). In this test, websites load automatically per script in 40-second intervals. The energy-saving profile is active, and the display brightness is set to about 150 cd/m\u00b2. We test a device's battery life during video playback by running the short film Big Buck Bunny (H.264 encoding, 1920x1080 pixels) on constant repeat. The energy-saving profile is active, the wireless modules are deactivated, and the display brightness is set to around 150 cd/m\u00b2. The Miix 2 holds out for 5:15 h. We did not perform this test on the Venue., 15324=The Miix 2 runs on an Intel\u00a0Core i3-4012Y\u00a0processor. This Haswell generation CPU is outfitted\u00a0with two cores and has a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz. There is no turbo, but the CPU supports Hyper-Threading (each core can process two threads). According to Intel, the processor's TDP is 11.5 Watts. To test whether the CPU can utilize its full performance capabilities, we ran the Cinebench benchmarks on the device. The processor's full performance was only available for single-thread applications -- the CPU completed the multi-thread tests at 900 to 1000 MHz. The processor behaved identically in both AC power mode and battery mode., 5665=Out of the factory, the display's average DeltaE 2000 deviation is 7.46. At that number, the panel does better than the majority of displays we have tested. Some colors even land in the target area (DeltaE less than 3). The display does not have a blue cast., 4906=In terms of contrast (860:1) and black value (0.4 cd/m\u00b2) too, the Miix 2's panel cannot be criticized. The\u00a0Venue 11's numbers here are more or less on par with our\u00a0review device's (909:1, 0.45 cd/m\u00b2). We cannot make a statement regarding the Miix 2's color space coverage, as our measuring device refused to be calibrated., 325924=In idle mode, the Miix 2's battery keeps chugging along for 11:22 h. The\u00a0Venue 11\u00a0(12:42 h) offers a little more stamina here. We test a device's battery life in\u00a0idle mode with Battery Eater's Reader's test: The display is set to the lowest brightness setting, the energy-saving profile is active, and the wireless modules are turned off. Under load, the Miix 2 cuts out after 3:22 h. The Venue 11's battery conks out earlier (2:03). We determine a device's battery life under load with the Battery Eater Classic test: The display runs at maximum brightness, and both the high-performance profile and the wireless modules are activated.}",
