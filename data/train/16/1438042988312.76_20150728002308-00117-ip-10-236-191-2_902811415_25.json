This week is just to help you get to know people and the campus and surrounding areas before school even starts. You feel at home within a week.

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Vanguard University, although it has a great environment for freshman and/or those who are new to a college environment, it is extremely expensive. Vanguard University does offer scholarship money, I know I got 12,000 dollars worth (the highest a student can get through academics is 13,000). But it was still extremely expensive and when you think about it, you can learn the same things at bigger and better schools for MUCH cheaper. The school, while a good environment, is not a good buy. Did enjoy being here As for the social life of the school, I think that the atmosphere here is very welcoming. Many of the people are amiable and accepting. However, do not be fooled by its Christian atmosphere. This school does have alcohol and drug consumption, but it is simply done off campus. But this school has a really great community and there is plenty to do, including the beach and Disneyland! Note: There is a required 30 spiritual formation credits. This means you must go to thirty chapels, which can be a hassle especially the week before finals. If you enjoy going to church, then great. If not, probably not the best place to go. Academic Rigor They have some really awesome teachers",
