    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{3842=BGP is an interdomain routing protocol designed to provide loop-free routing links between organizations. BGP is designed to run over a reliable transport protocol; it uses TCP (port 179) as the transport protocol because TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. The destination TCP port is assigned 179, and the local port is assigned a random port number. Cisco software supports BGP version 4 and it is this version that has been used by Internet service providers (ISPs) to help build the Internet. RFC 1771 introduced and discussed a number of new BGP features to allow the protocol to scale for Internet use. RFC 2858 introduced multiprotocol extensions to allow BGP to carry routing information for IP multicast routes and multiple Layer 3 protocol address families, including IPv4, IPv6, and CLNS.}",

The route refresh capability does not store update information locally for nondisruptive policy changes. It instead relies on dynamic exchange with supporting peers. Route refresh must first be advertised through BGP capability negotiation between peers. All BGP devices must support the route refresh capability. To determine if a BGP device supports this capability, use the show ip bgp neighbors command. The following message is displayed in the output when the device supports the route refresh capability:, 305903=RFC 1772, 306239=RFC 1773}",
