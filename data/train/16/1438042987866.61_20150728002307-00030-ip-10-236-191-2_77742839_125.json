Therefore, if services are supplied in another EU member state, they are taxable in the recipient's country. For business-to-customer supply of services, the general rule for place of supply continues to be the place where the supplier is established. There are exceptions to the new rule for certain types of services. Examples include: services provided for immovable property, passenger transport services, cultural, and educational events. It also includes ancillary services, short term hiring of means of transport, and restaurant and catering services carried out on board a ship, aircraft, or train within the EU., 591613=Invoice line 3 amount: 2567 USD, 849976=1000 USD * 10/100, 591665=Invoice line 2 amount: 1679 USD, 373592=The country tax is equal to the taxable basis multiplied by the county tax rate (1680 USD * 10% = 168 USD)., 679116=2003 SIC, 850837=The following table illustrates the calculation methodology used with each of these options when a transaction line amount is 1000 USD and the applicable tax rate is 10% of the taxable basis amount, for example, line amount:, 588690=1679, 373921=The state tax is equal to the invoice line amount multiplied by the state tax rate (1000 USD * 20% = 200 USD)., 674121=The supply of widgets by Widget Inc., UK Ltd. is within the terms and conditions of supplies to NATO forces which allows a supplier to zero rate supplies to visiting NATO forces.

The changes are introduced to modernize and simplify rules relating to cross-border supply of services and recovery of input tax. These are the most far-reaching changes to VAT law since the introduction of the Single European Market in 1993. This impacts all businesses, which supply and purchase services across EU countries.
