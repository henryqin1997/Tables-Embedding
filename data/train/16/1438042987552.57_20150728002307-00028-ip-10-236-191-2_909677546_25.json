    "textBeforeTable": "Recommended releases Downloads You maintain page nodes for items like Terms of Service or Privacy Policy. These nodes appear on several sites and should always be the same. There are relatively static pages (like an About Us page) that have links from your primary navigation. If these were to go missing, your client would certainly say the site is broken. Examples: The UUID Features Integration module provides a mechanism for exporting content (nodes, taxonomy, fields) into a features module. What's that you say? You thought features was only for configuration? This module is meant to be used in the cases where certain pieces of content straddle the line between pure content and configuration. UUID Features 7.x-1.0-alpha3 fixes some HTML code that made the module completely unusable. Please update ASAP. If you're experiencing WSOD simply remove the module files completely then upload the latest version. The latest version now works with UUID 7.x-1.0-alpha3. Please report any bug you encounter in the issue queue. Comparison with other modules with similar functionalities: #1311428: Comparison with Node export (and possibly other modules with similar functionalities)? We need patches and reviews! Please contribute here! Co-maintainer(s) wanted! Please contact us. July 26, 2010 at 10:17pm Jeffrey C.",
