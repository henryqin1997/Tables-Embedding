Known as the \u201cGodfather of the Ohio Posse\u201d, it was Perry\u2019s first checker of the 2005 season. John Ledwidge led the first lap of the 40-lap feature, with fast qualifier, Jon McNett buried in the middle of the field. Tim \u201cThe Hit Man\u201d Ryan returned to a Super Late, giving Perry a run for his money. Perry made his way around the leader, Ledwidge, on lap 20, with Ryan reeling in the leaders. A 20-lap battle for the lead made for some great racing, with Bob Bauer and Chris Place jumping into the mix behind Perry, Ryan, and Ledwidge. Ryan peeked around Perry, both high and low, but couldn\u2019t make it stick, as Perry outran him to the stripe coming out of turn four. Heat winner included Dale Lewis and Chris Place. \u201cSmokin\u201d Bud Perry, son of SLM driver Stan Perry, scored another win for the \u201cOhio Posse\u201d in the MI Army National Guard MI Modified division. Fast qualifier, Chris Ozanich, started twelfth on the grid, and moved quickly to the front, sitting second by lap 13. Lap one leader, Bill Butler, held off Jason Parish and Perry for 10-laps, then relinquished the lead to Perry on lap 11. Butler, Ozanich, and Earl Miles were caught up in a three-car battle for third, as Perry pulled away from the field. Lap 20 saw Parish and Ozanich alone in second and third, respectively. Dick Maurer made his run from 13th position to sit by lap 29. Second place, Ozanich, tangled with slower traffic, bringing out the caution after 33 laps of green flag racing, setting up a two lap shootout between Perry, Parish, Ozanich, Miles, and Maurer. Heat wins were awarded to Rick Gokee Sr. and Parish. Dane Long continued his fast qualifier streak, and found himself sitting tenth in the field for the Performance Automotive Northwest Street Stock 25-lap feature. It was a replay of last week\u2019s feature, as Dave Thorburn and Howard McDonough sat on the front row. Thorburn led lap one, with McDonough issuing a serious challenge for first. McDonough took over the top spot on lap six, but Thorburn continued to fight for first through lap 10. Bubber Patrick and Dane Long began their march up through the field and found themselves sitting second and third by lap 15. McDonough continued to lead until lap 18, when Long made his way into first. Rob Patrick worked his way up into the top five, along with Ed Newman Jr. It was Long to the winners circle, followed by R. Patrick, Newman, Bollis, and McDonough. Jordan Harvey, Thorburn, and Corey Davis scored heat wins. The Q106 Pony Stocks were chomping at the bit to get their 20-lap feature started. Trei Deubel, fast qualifier, started thirteenth in the field. The green flag saw Ponies stacked up three-wide at the line, and five-wide going into turn one. Jason Brunn led lap one, with Jimmy Scavarda and Deubel on the move from the rear of the field. John Ward assumed the lead from Brunn, only to have Deubel, Scavarda, and Julie Dailey take over the top three positions by lap seven. A battle for fourth and fifth made for good racing between John Conroy and George Wyers. At the line, it was Deubel, Scavarda, Dailey, Wyers, and Kretzinger. Brunn and Deubel were heat winners.}",
