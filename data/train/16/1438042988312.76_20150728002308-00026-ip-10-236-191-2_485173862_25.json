Accordingly, the invention should only be limited by the Claims included below. As also discussed above, user gestures are used to determine the portion of the address book that the user wants to access. The system renders only that portion of the address book that the user appears to need. In this way, the user only receives the portion of the address book that he is currently navigating. Thus, the invention provides a means for interpreting navigation to provide a limited portion of the address book consistent with the navigation. For example, if the user is scrolling very quickly through the alphabet, the system would render portion of the address book that corresponds to the letters of the alphabet, e.g. A, B, C and so forth, on the user device when the user stops scrolling. Until the user stops scrolling, the system skips the list of contacts associated with each letter of the alphabet. As the user slows down the speed at which he is scrolling, for example, scrolling through D, the system starts rendering more information to the user device. Thus, there are any number of heuristics involved in interpreting user",
