These are listed in alphabetical order, irrespective of namespace. 5.3 Properties and Relationships NB The original ADMS specification supports the provision of a description of the metadata about an Asset, including its publisher and language (i.e. the human language in which the metadata is expressed, irrespective of the language used in the Asset itself). The DCAT concept of a Catalog Record can be used for this purpose and so is not detailed in this document. skos:ConceptScheme A controlled vocabulary that contains terms that are used as Themes for the Assets in a Repository, linked from the Repository using dcat:themeTaxonomy . 5.2.15 Theme Taxonomy skos:Concept The sector that an Asset applies to, e.g. \"law\" or \"environment\".
