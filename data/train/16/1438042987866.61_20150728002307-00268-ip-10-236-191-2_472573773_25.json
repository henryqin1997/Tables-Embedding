The reactions were conducted at the following initial conditions: 5% wt of catalyst, and a hydrogen overpressure of 1400 kPa. The following table presents compositions after reacting in a closed reactor (with topping off of hydrogen) for 24 hours at a reaction temperature of 200\ufffd C., 64077=Table 4 summarizes the impact of initial water content in the reactants on formation of propylene glycol from glycerol. The reactions were conducted at the following initial conditions: 5% wt of catalyst, and a hydrogen overpressure of 1400 kPa. The catalyst was purchased from Sud-Chemie as a powder catalyst having 30 m2/g surface area, 45% CuO, 47% Cr2O3, 3.5% MnO2 and 2.7% BaO. The following table presents compositions after reacting in a closed reactor (with topping off of hydrogen) for 24 hours at a reaction temperature of 200\ufffd C., 171737=Acetol was hydrogenated in presence of copper chromium catalyst to form a mixture containing propylene glycol. The following were the approximate initial conditions: 10 grams of acetol, 2 wt % of catalyst, and a hydrogen overpressure of 1400 kPa. The following table presents compositions after reacting in a closed reactor (with topping off of hydrogen) for 4 hours at a reaction temperature of 190\ufffd C. Table 18 shows the effect of reaction temperature on the formation of propylene glycol from acetol. The data illustrate that good conversions are attainable at 190\ufffd C. The data illustrate that the co-product (likely undesirable) of lactaldehyde is produced at lower selectivities at temperatures greater than 150\ufffd C. Optimal temperatures appear to be 190\ufffd C. or higher. The copper chromium catalyst used in this Illustrative Example was reduced in presence of hydrogen at a temperature of 300\ufffd C. for 4 hours prior to the reaction., 89163=Crude glycerol obtained as a by product of the biodiesel industry was used instead of refined glycerol. Biodiesel is produced using alcoholysis of bio-renewable fats and oils. The composition of feedstock 104 used in this example had an approximate composition as follows: glycerol (57%), methyl alcohol (23%), and other materials (soaps, residual salts, water) (20%). The above feedstock was reacted in the presence of hydrogen and catalyst to form a mixture containing propylene glycol. The reaction proceeded using 10 grams of the crude feedstock, 5% by weight of catalyst, and a hydrogen overpressure of 1400 kPa. The following Table 6 presents compositions after reacting in a closed reactor (with topping off of hydrogen) for 24 hours at a temperature of 200\ufffd C. The copper chromium catalyst used in this Example was reduced in presence of hydrogen at a temperature of 300\ufffd C. for 4 hours prior to the reaction., 38077=One type of polyhydric feedstock 104 may contain glycerol that is prepared by transesterification of oils or fatty acids, for example, as described in co-pending application Ser. No. 10/420,047 filed Apr. 23, 2003, which is incorporated by reference to the same extent as though fully replicated herein. In a polyhydric feedstock 104 of this type, water may be present in an amount ranging from 0% to 70%. More preferably, water is present in an amount ranging from 5% to 15%. Water may be added to reduce side-reactions, such as the formation of oligomers., 17807=This application is a Divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/645,213 filed Dec. 22, 2009, which is a Divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/088,603 filed Mar. 24, 2005 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,663,004), which claims benefit of priority to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/556,334 filed Mar. 25, 2004 and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/420,047 filed Apr. 21, 2003, which claims benefit of priority to U.S. provisional Patent Application Ser. Nos. 60/374,292, filed Apr. 22, 2002 and 60/410,324, filed Sep. 13, 2002, all of which are incorporated by reference herein., 53017=Table 2 summarizes reaction performance with a higher initial water content, namely, 30 grams of refined glycerol and 70 grams of water. The reactions were conducted at the following initial conditions: 5% wt of catalyst, and a hydrogen overpressure of 1400 kPa. The following table presents compositions after reacting in a closed reactor (with topping off of hydrogen) for 24 hours at a reaction temperature of 200\ufffd C., 142848=This example illustrates the stability of the copper chromium catalyst for the formation of propyelene glycol from acetol. The following were the approximate initial conditions: 4.5 grams of acetol, 2 wt % of catalyst, and a hydrogen overpressure of 1400 kPa. The following table presents compositions after reacting in a closed reactor (with topping off of hydrogen) for 4 hours at a reaction temperature of 185\ufffd C. The copper chromium catalyst was reduced in presence of hydrogen at a temperature of 300\ufffd C. for 4 hours prior to the reaction. The catalyst after each run was filtered from the reaction products, washed with methanol and then dried in a furnace at temperature of 80\ufffd C. This regenerated catalyst was reused in the subsequent reactions. Similar regeneration procedure is repeated 10 times and the results are summarized in Table 14. These data illustrate the ability to reuse catalyst for the hydrogenation of acetol., 99867=Glycerol was reacted in the presence of copper chromium catalyst in two steps to form a mixture containing propylene glycol. In Step 1, relatively pure acetol was isolated from glycerol in absence of hydrogen at a reaction pressure of 98 kPa (vac). In Step 2, the acetol from Step 1 was further reacted in presence of hydrogen to propylene glycol at 1400 kPa hydrogen over pressure using similar catalyst that is used for the formation of acetol. The catalyst used in the step 1 of this Example is used in the condition in which they arrived and the catalyst used in the Step 2 was reduced in presence of hydrogen at a temperature of 300\ufffd C. for 4 hours prior to the reaction.}",

A fourth class of reaction that occurs when hydrogen is present that substantially inhibits the formation of the residue of the third reaction where the rate of formation of residue is reduced by at least 50% with the hydrogen partial pressure in 50 bars. A third class of reaction proceeds substantially in parallel the first reaction including the reactant forming a higher molecular weight residue species that directly or indirectly reduces the effectiveness of the catalyst promoting the first reaction. A second class of liquid phase catalytic reaction occurs where the reactant reacts in a parallel mechanism with hydrogen to form at least one alternative product (e.g. propylene glycol) where the alternative product has a boiling point that is at least 20\ufffd C. lower in",
