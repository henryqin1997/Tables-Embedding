Other aspects, advantages, and modifications are within the scope of the following claims. OTHER EMBODIMENTS Any microengine 22 that uses the FBI unsolicited push technique must test the protection flag prior to accessing the FBUS interface/microengine agreed upon transfer registers. If the flag is not asserted, then the transfer registers may be accessed by the microengine. If the flag is Asserted then the context should wait N cycles prior to accessing the registers. Initially, this count is determined by the number of transfer registers being pushed, plus a frontend protection window. The basic idea is that the microengine must test this flag then quickly move the data which it wishes to read from the read transfer registers to GPR's in contiguous cycles, so the push engine does not collide with the microengine read. Generally, transfer registers require protection from the context controlling them to guarantee read correctness. In particular, if a write transfer register is being used by a thread\u20141 to provide data to the SDRAM 16 a, thread\u20141 must not overwrite this register until the signal back from SDRAM controller 26 a indicates that this register",
