One of them is gaurenteed $125,420...and a chance to play one more hand for $10 million to split between him/herself and a GSN viewer. And Kevin Nealon and \"poker expert\" Robert Williamson III is here to call the action. Unlike my lengthy recaps of the WPT and CPS, since this show shows all hands but not all bets, I am forced to just recap the key hands through commentary.
