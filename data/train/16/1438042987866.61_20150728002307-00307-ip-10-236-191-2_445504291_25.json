Crandall, Charlottesville, VA US Patent application number Description Published 20110130111 SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MINIMIZING OCCUPANT INJURY DURING VEHICLE CRASH EVENTS - A method, computer program product and apparatus for minimizing occupant injury by optimizing occupant restraint properties and/or actions in real time, during pre-crash and crash phases. The restraint system uses three catalogs and a database linking these catalogs. The catalogs include a catalog of possible occupant states, a catalog of possible collision scenarios, and a catalog of potential restraint control laws. The database is an assessment of injury outcome for each possible combination of occupant state, collision scenario, and restraint control law. In addition to the catalogs, the method requires four computational components: an occupant identifier, a collision identifier, a restraint law optimizer, and a restraint controller. 06-02-2011 Jerry Alan Crandall, Fernley, NV US Patent application number Description Published 20130016449 SELF-DEFENSE SYSTEMAANM Crandall; Jerry AlanAACI FernleyAAST NVAACO USAAGP Crandall; Jerry Alan Fernley NV US - In an embodiment, a self-defense system is disclosed.
