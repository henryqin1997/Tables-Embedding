In particular, plasticizers such as phthalates, adipates, trimellitate esters, polyesters, and other functionalized plasticizers as disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,318,835; 4,409,345; WO 02/31044 A1; and PLASTICS ADDITIVES 499-504 (Geoffrey Pritchard, ed., Chapman & Hall 1998) are substantially absent. By \u201csubstantially absent,\u201d it is meant that these compounds are not added deliberately to the compositions and if present at all, are present at less than 0.5 wt %., 83203=Preferred compositions of the present invention can be characterized in that the weight of the modified composition decreases less than 3%, preferably less than 2%, preferably less than 1%, preferably less than 0.5%, preferably less than 0.1%, preferably less than 0.05%, preferably less than 0.01%, when plasticizer permanence is determined by ASTM D1203 (0.25 mm thick sheet, 300 hours in dry 70\ufffd C. oven). Weight loss here refers to the reduction in weight in excess of that measured for the unmodified crosslinked polyethylene under the same test conditions., 53370=Other references of interest include U.S. 2001/0056159, U.S. Pat.

More preferably, the crosslinking/coupling agent may be a bifunctional organosilane crosslinking agent. An \u201corganosilane crosslinking agent\u201d is any silane coupled filler and/or crosslinking activator and/or silane reinforcing agent known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, vinyl triethoxysilane, vinyl-tris-(beta-methoxyethoxy)silane, methacryloylpropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-amino-propyl triethoxysilane (sold commercially as A1100 by Witco), gamma-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (A189 by Witco) and the like, and mixtures thereof., 134669=This invention also relates to flexibilized crosslinked polyethylene compositions comprising one or more polyethylene base resins crosslinked in the presence of one or more non-functionalized plasticizers, where one or more NFP's is a high purity hydrocarbon fluid derived from a GTL process comprising a mixture of paraffins of carbon number ranging from about C20 to C100, a molar ratio of isoparaffins:n-paraffins greater than about 50:1, the percentage of carbons in paraffinic structures (CP) of 98% or more, a pour point ranging from about \u221220\ufffd to \u221260\ufffd C., and a kinematic viscosity at 100\ufffd C. ranging from about 6 to 20 cSt., 187198=In a preferred embodiment, slip additives may be present in the compositions of this invention. Preferably the slip additives are present at 0.001 to 1 wt % (10 to 10,000 ppm), more preferably 0.01 to 0.5 wt % (100 to 5000 ppm), more preferably 0.1 to 0.3 wt % (1000 to 3000 ppm), based upon the weight of the composition., 102504=The MI of preferred ethylene polymers in the base resins, as measured according to ASTM D1238 (190\ufffd C., 2.16 kg), ranges from 0.02 dg/min to 800 dg/min in one embodiment, from 0.05 to 500 dg/min in another embodiment, and from 0.1 to 100 dg/min in another embodiment. In another embodiment of the present invention, the polyethylene has a MI of 20 dg/min or less, 7 dg/min or less, 5 dg/min or less, or 2 dg/min or less, or less than 2 dg/min. In yet another embodiment, the polymer has a Mooney viscosity, ML(1+4) (125\ufffd C. (measured according to ASTM D1646), of 100 or less, 75 or less, 60 or less, or 30 or less., 324121=The MDOD of a water solution containing a number of pipe samples with and without modifier were compared to inert controls like glass and active controls like wax, in a manner consistent with BS 6920:2000. Samples that supported microorganism growth had their oxygen depleted over time, which led to a large MDOD. Samples that did not support microorganism growth maintained constant oxygen concentration over time and had low MDOD. Table 15 displays the results for a number of inventive modifiers in PEX pile sample., 69798=For the purposes of this invention a liquid is defined to be a fluid that has no distinct melting point above 0\ufffd C., preferably no distinct melting point above \u221220\ufffd C.; and has a kinematic viscosity at 100\ufffd C. of 3000 cSt or less, preferably 1000 cSt or less and/or a kinematic viscosity at 40\ufffd C. of 35,000 cSt or less, preferably 10,000 cSt or less., 172562=The polyethylene copolymers are capable of being crosslinked by a reactive unsaturated silane compound. Silane crosslinking processes well-known in the art include the commercially available MONOSIL process developed by Maillefer and BICC, and the SIOPLAS process developed by Dow Corning. In the SIOPLAS, or two-step process, a polyethylene is first graft-modified in a compounding mixer or extruder with a reactive silane compound and a free radical initiator, such as dicumyl peroxide, for example, to produce a silane-grafted polyethylene that can be pelletized and shipped or stored for subsequent processing. The silane-grafted polyethylene is then compounded with a silanol condensation catalyst and melt-extruded in the desired form, such as a pipe or a wire coating layer, followed by curing (crosslinking) by heat and moisture, such as in a water bath or a steam bath. In warm and humid climates, curing can take place under ambient conditions. Polyethylene crosslinking compounding materials are available from a number of manufacturers who supply silane pre-grafted base resins and catalyst masterbatches that can be mixed in the proper proportions, e.g. 95/5 or 50/50 by weight grafted PE resin/catalyst masterbatch, to produce a material curable by exposure to steam at 70\ufffd C.-90\ufffd C. or ambient moisture. For example, SIOPLAS PEX system components are available from Padanaplast USA under the trade designation PEXIDAN\ufffd (PEXIDAN\ufffd V/T, PEXIDAN\ufffd X/T, PEXIDAN\ufffd U/T, PEXIDAN\ufffd R/T, PEXIDAN\ufffd H/T, PEXIDAN\ufffd L/T) that include a silane pregraft (designated A-1001) and a catalyst masterbatch (designated CAT-010FR, CAT-005FR, CAT-008, CAT-009, CAT-012FR, CAT-003, respectively). Other SIOPLAS PEX system suppliers include AEI Compounds Ltd. (SX704 silane pregraft PE and CM488 catalyst masterbatch); Silon Compounds Ltd. (TA1108 HD silane pregraft PE and TA 2125 HD catalyst masterbatch)., 204210=Average % Gels: The gel tests measure the percent of crosslinked, un-dissolvable material in a polymer sample. These tests were performed and measured according to ASTM D2765, Test Method for Determination of Gel Content and Swell Ratio of Crosslinked Ethylene Plastics. In some cases the data are reported on a normalized basis, meaning that the percent gel is by weight of the polymeric components only by accounting for the presence of low molecular weight compounds such as NFPs which are assumed to dissolve in the solvent used in the tests. For example, a crosslinked polyethylene specimen comprising 3 wt % NFP containing 65.8 wt % gel is normalized to 65.8/(1-0.03)=67.8 wt % gel on a polymer basis., 157617=In another preferred embodiment the NFP has a glass transition temperature (Tg) that cannot be determined by ASTM E 1356 or, if it can be determined, then the Tg according to ASTM E 1356 is less than 0\ufffd C., preferably less than \u221210\ufffd C., more preferably less than \u221220\ufffd C., more preferably less than \u221230\ufffd C., more preferably less than \u221240\ufffd C., and, preferably, also has one or more of the following properties: (1) an initial boiling point as determined by ASTM D 1160 greater than 300\ufffd C., preferably greater than 350\ufffd C., preferably greater than 400\ufffd C.; and/or (2) a pour point of \u221210\ufffd C. or less, preferably \u221215\ufffd C. or less, preferably \u221225\ufffd C. or less, preferably \u221235\ufffd C. or less, preferably \u221245\ufffd C. or less; and/or (3) a specific gravity (ASTM D 4052, 15.6/15.6\ufffd C.) of less than 0.88, preferably less than 0.86, preferably less than 0.84, preferably from 0.80 to 0.88, preferably from 0.82 to 0.86; and/or (4) a final boiling point as determined by ASTM D1160 of from 300\ufffd C. to 800\ufffd C., preferably from 400\ufffd C. to 700\ufffd C., preferably greater than 500\ufffd C.; and/or (5) an Mw between 30,000 and 400 g/mol preferably between 15,000 and 450 g/mol; and/or (6) an Mn between 10,000 and 400 g/mol, preferably between 5,000 and 450 g/mol; and/or (7) a flash point as measured by ASTM D 92 of 200\ufffd C. or greater., 191342=By elastomers is meant all natural and synthetic rubbers, including those defined in ASTM D1566.
