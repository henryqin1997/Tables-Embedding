            "USE OF PEDF-DERIVED POLYPEPTIDES FOR PROMOTING STEM CELLS PROLIFERATION AND WOUND HEALING - Disclosed herein is a synthetic peptide, which has an amino acid sequence that has 20-39 amino acid residues. The synthetic peptide has at least 80% amino acid sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 1, and includes at least 20 consecutive residues that has at least 90% amino acid sequence identity to residues 11-30 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Also disclosed herein are compositions containing the synthetic peptide and applications thereof. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the synthetic peptide is useful in promoting stem cells proliferation or wound healing.",
            "Use of PEDF-Derived Polypeptides for Treating Liver Cirrhosis - The present disclosure elucidates that 34-mer PEDF suppresses hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) from activation by diminishing the levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMC), collagen type 1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1); and 44-mer PEDF promotes liver regeneration process by enhancing the replication of liver-derived progenitor cells (LDPCs). Accordingly, methods and compositions directing to the new use of the 34-mer PEDF or 44-mer PEDF in patients suffering from liver cirrhosis are provided herein."
