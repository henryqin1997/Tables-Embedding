Input (Literal) http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/AssayDownload Action Given an assay key, prepare for download a file containing an assay data table in the selected format. See the assay query section of the PUG service documentation (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pug/pughelp.html) for more detail on the supported formats. Compression is optional and defaults to gzip (.gz). Returns a download key. Asynchronous. Description Method: AssayDownload Search PubChem Compound for structures contained within the one given by the structure key input, based on a user-selected level of chemical identity: connectivity only, match isotopes and/or stereo, etc. The search may be limited by elapsed time or number of records found, or restricted to search only within a previous result set (given by a list key). Returns a list key. Asynchronous. SuperstructureSearch\u00a0 Search PubChem Compound for structures containing the one given by the structure key input, based on a user-selected level of chemical identity: connectivity only, match isotopes and/or stereo, etc. The search may be limited by elapsed time or number of records found, or restricted to search only within a previous result set (given by a list key). Returns a list key. Asynchronous. SubstructureSearch\u00a0 Standardize the structure given by the structure key input, using the same algorithm PubChem uses to construct the Compound database.
