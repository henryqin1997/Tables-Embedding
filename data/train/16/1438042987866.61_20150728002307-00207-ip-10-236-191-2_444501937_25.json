            "INFRARED INSPECTION OF BONDED SUBSTRATES - A method and apparatus for obtaining inspection information is described. A standard CCD or CMOS camera is used to obtain images in the near infrared region. Background and noise components of the obtained image are removed and the signal to noise ratio is increased to provide information that is suitable for use in inspection.",
            "POSITION SENSITIVE DETECTION OPTIMIZATION - An automatically adjustable method for use in opto-acoustic metrology or other types of metrology operations is described. The method includes modifying the operation of a metrology system that uses a PSD style sensor arrangement. The method may be used to quickly adjust the operation of a metrology system to ensure that the data obtained therefrom are of the desired quality. Further, the method is useful in searching for and optimizing data that is or can be correlated to substrate or sample features or characteristics that of interest. Apparatus and computer readable media are also described."

The inner channel allows fluid communication between an inlet and an outlet. The outlet includes a nozzle for providing a mist spray. The mist system incorporates a covering, such as for an awning or bimini cover. 05-09-2013 20130235558 AWNING ROLL ATTACHMENT WITH ILLUMINATION AND MIST - An awning roll attachment that mounts directly to the awning roll and includes an internal illumination system and misting system. The awning roll attachment is connected to a roll tube using a press fit connection. The illumination system includes a light strip that is seated or embedded within a longitudinal channel formed in the attachment body. The misting system includes a plurality of misting nozzles that are tapped into bores in the attachment body and are in open communication with an internal fluid passage formed in the attachment body that runs its entire length. A connection fitting is connected to the fluid passage at one end of the attachment body and an end plug closes the fluid passage at the opposite end of the attachment body. 09-12-2013 Wei Zhou, Saint Paul, MN US Patent application number Description Published 20130216122 SCRATCH DETECTION METHOD AND APPARATUS - A method of identifying discontinuities in the surface of a",
