            "outgoing and involved people will love this school. also people who love learning even outside of the classroom.",
            "i am not sure if there are any.",
            "there is really only one word i can say for this: impressed. i am impressed with the school overall and even the price we have to pay to go here. it is expensive but we are getting a quality education from teachers who want to be there. it is great. i love it.",
            "i play intramural sports for fun. you can go downtown or to clemson also because those are not far away. you can play tennis out on the courts or basketball. some people set up hammocks outside and sit down to read a book. there is almost always a game of ultimate frisbee going on even if it is raining.",
            "the food is terrible. anytime someone asks me what i would change about anderson it is the food without a doubt. most of it is cold and you only have a one hour time frame to come to the cafe or else you missed a meal. they make you have a meal plan freshman year so there is no staying away from it.",
            "it is fun living with other people. i ended up with the largest room on campus as a freshman but the other rooms aren't bad either. they test the fire alarms a lot however, most of the time during the night.",
            "for my major, graphic design, there are some hard and time consuming courses that i need to take. however, if you put your time and effort into your work then it will come easy.",
            "if you are offered the chance to go stay at the school overnight to get a feel for collage life, take it. i never went and visited but i should have. the people you stay with are guaranteed to be friendly.",
            "anderson is a good community based campus that focuses on involving students. the teachers are supportive and the students are friendly. the campus is small but yard crews spend a lot of time making sure it is one of the best looking campuses around."

However, we have speakers and organizations that come that are truly a joy to hear from., 188102=The new girl dorms, the Boulevards, are wonderful. They have community bathrooms and they're great. I was really skeptical of having community bathrooms but it's great once you get used to it. It has a 3:1 girls to bathroom ratio compared to the older girls dorms (Denmark and Pratt) that have a 6:1 bathroom ratio. If you're a guy then you aren't in the best of luck because the guys dorms are not as nice as the girls unless you pay extra to live in your own room in the Village., 361544=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 150005=It is a university of around 2500 students but is 100 years old.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students AU is a great fit for those who are hard workers, love fun and friends and are willing to grow and face their fears. Come visit! Tips for prospective students 1. Apply for scholarships early. 2. Get your grades up! Hard work does count when it comes to scholarships! Also, working hard now will prepare you for college. 3. Talk with the teachers of the major(s) you are considering. Make a list of what's important to you and discuss that with them. 4. Last, but definitely not least. VISIT THE CAMPUS! You will never know if you are meant to be at a school unless you go. Believe me, you will just know if its right for you. Bang for the buck This school is one of the few private Christian schools that offers a lot of scholarships. Also, the quality of education, the beauty of the campus, and the overall positivity of the student body and faculty makes this a great buy. This is an educational experience that is hard to find. Am enjoying being here The campus is beautiful with the big brick buildings all over campus and the green grassy front lawn where students socialize and",
