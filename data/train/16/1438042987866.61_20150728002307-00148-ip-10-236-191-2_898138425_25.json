    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{435234=The 1st friday in March marks unofficial St. Patrick's Day here at U of I. Everyone walks the streets wearing green and drinks til they can't stand no more., 963724=There are tons of clubs on campus--so many that picking one is hard! However, there is an office in the Illini Union to help you find a club that is right for you. U of I has a club for everything from triathlons to chemistry to October Lovers., 209042=There are tons of clubs and activities one can participate in, and there is just about something for everyone so that no one is without a niche. The school makes an effort to reach out to its students at the beginning of every year during Quad Day, and that's where a person can find out about academic clubs, fraternities, and activities that they may never have had the opportunity to participate in before such as fencing or kayaking. You can find professional clubs that can give you the edge you need when looking for internships, or you can take part in clubs that are simply in it for the fun of it such as the October Lovers club, or better yet, do both!, 419334=academically the u of i is top notch, i am in the kinesiology program here which is ranked 2nd overall nationally. there are over 1000 registered student organizations so there is definitely always something to get involved in. the university overall in my opinion is a great place to pursue further education., 983811=Try and apply during the earliest application period in Nov. This will give you the best chance to get into the University. Don't worry if you don't know what you want to do for a major, many students are undecided when they come. Also, get to know the people who live on your dorm floor, because they may turn into your best friends at college. Join some student groups or college clubs, this will help you meet people when you get here., 424813=Wear orange on Friday. Unofficial St. Patrick's Day is a giant party in March. Some students who still support Chief Illiniwek as a symbol of the university wear Chief shirts and participate in The Chief's Last Dance during homecoming week., 467847=There are over 1000 registered clubs and activities at this school!!!, 623833=There are over 1000 clubs and activities to join on campus. If there isn't anything you like you are given the opportunity to start the club your self!, 835990=Being in one of the worst dorm halls on campus my opinion may be skewed here, but Forbes Hall, while it doesn't have any horrible issues, is not the best place to live. After this year it is actually being torn down, though, so anyone looking to apply for the 2013-2014 school year or after can ignore this., 424146=1000 registered clubs and probably more. There's something for everyone., 365215=There are over 1000 clubs and organizations to become involved in. This school is huge with sports (division I) so there are many sport facilities and courts to play on. There are 2 huge gyms which is a great de-stressor with many open courts to play on. There are also talent shows and other shows performed every where on campus, but plays and musicals are performed in the Krannert Art Center., 618934=You would find a lot of choices on quad day. I've joined October lovers and a new one that started recently Holly Jollies (for those who love the winter & the holidays). I participate with the Office of Volunteer Program. You can find many volunteer work with them., 454139=UnOfficial is an awesome tradition. Similar to green beer day at other schools, UnOfficial is the first Friday of March and is an Unofficial celebration of St. Patrick's day 2 weeks early. It consists of everyone getting dressed up in their finest green and parading through the streets all day., 175417=In-state tuition is really good value, at a base rate of $10,386 for the 2010-2011 year. However, being from out-of-state, tuition can get pricy at a base rate of $24,528. A tip to bring down the cost for any student is to be serious about high school grades, and receive academic scholarships, as well as applying to outside scholarships., 860632=With over 1,000 to choose from, there are clubs for everyone! Sky diving, volunteering, sports, October lovers, squirrel chasers, theater fans, etc., 524019=New dorms for freshmen are being built and to be finished in Fall 2012. Students are required to live in the dorms for one year., 248716=There are over 1000 clubs at this school, and if the one you want is not here, you can start your own., 54261=I cannot say whether or not the dorm life is exceptional because I am a transfer student and I moved in to a house off campus to save money. There is construction going on in what's known as The Six-Pack which is a cluster of dormitories in a small area. It should be completed by Spring of 2013 and it looks fantastic so far!, 13033=U of I is a gorgeous campus. If you have spent some time looking at pictures online but have not visited, visit now! It is even more beautiful in person. The first time I stood on the Quad (big grassy central area of campus where students go to lay out, study, play Frisbee, or meet up with friends), I felt like I was standing on a brochure cover. The intense green of the leaves and grass complimented by the array of bright colored flowers are truly a sight. Even in the winter, the snow-tipped trees framing the Illini Union building are picture-perfect. Beyond the stunning visuals of this campus, U of I has over 1,200 RSO's (Registered Student Organizations) to get involved with to meet a lot of people while doing whatever you are passionate about. From a cappella choirs to tightrope walking to book club to the October Lover's club (formed to do all the fun fall activities like pumpkin carving, apple picking, corn maze exploring, etc.), there is at least one RSO for everyone. If you cannot find one you would like to be a part of, you can create your own! Discovery of all these grand organizations happens on Quad day, a fun day in the very beginning of the year when all of the RSO's set up a table on the Quad (yes, the Quad is packed!) and have members and paper information and sometimes other goodies to help you learn about their organization. Can't choose just one? You can be involved with as many RSO's as you choose. Even if you are not sure you will have time to do something but you would like more information, sign up for that RSO's emailing list, which should be on their table. You can easily remove yourself at any time throughout the year. RSO's are an excellent way to make friends with similar interests! Greek life is of course another way to meet people and get involved in the community. Just by rushing, you will meet a wide variety of people that you can socialize with and learn about. All houses will coordinate with each other and arrange weekly (if not more often) fun exchanges (when a sorority and fraternity party together; usually themed; each house has its own policy on whether these are optional). Worried about the money or time involved with sororities and fraternities? Rushing on its own is a great experience! And unlike what many think, not participating in Greek life does not mean you are not social! You will form many friendships in and out of sororities and fraternities through your residence hall, RSO's, class small groups, and random events. Everywhere you go, there is sure to be someone you will hit it off with! At night, the party scene at U of I is a blast. Greek or not, there are pre-games and parties in apartments and fraternities all over campus. In addition to these, there are plenty of bars that will jive with your fancy. Want to dance? Go to the ridiculous dance floor at Joe's. Feelin' crazy? Go ride the mechanical bull at Kam's on Country Night. Want to be classy for a night? Wine night at The Clybourne is the place to be. Feelin' frisky? Say hello to the frat boys in Red Lion. Hungry? Hit up Wing Wednesday at Brother's! And if there is a game, get a spot in front of the big screen at Legends. Oh, and a Champaign blessing: all bars are 19 and up, and there is only cover (when you have to pay to get into a bar) on the weekends. Party scene not your thing? There are plenty of other things to do on campus! The Illini Union's basement is filled with fun activities. In addition to its full-sized bowling ally, there are pool and air hockey tables, Dance Dance Revolution machines (next to each other, to compete with your partner of course), a food court, and cozy couches in front of a big screen TV to watch a game or just hang out. Want to get some energy out? Channel your athletic side at the ARC, where there are 4 basketball courts, 12 racquetball courts, a 35-foot climbing wall, a 1/5-mile indoor track, two 50-meter swimming pools (one outdoors!), a 35-person sauna, hundreds of machines and weights, and a UI Wellness Center, where you can receive anything from athletic training to physical therapy. Want to see a movie that just came out? Hop on a bus and you can get to the Savoy 16 movie theatre in Champaign. And be sure to attend the monthly Illinites events! Held in the Union, the Illinites provide free food, games, concerts, and other activities for some late night fun. Worried that you will not be able to study during the weekend? RA's are always on call to make sure your floor is not disruptive. However, if you find it is hard to focus, the numerous libraries on campus are open 24/7 and are quiet havens for those of us with a big exam or a huge project coming up. In regards to the large campus size, this comes as a concern for many when trying to choose a school. How am I going to get to class? Will I be able to make and keep any of my friends? How will I know where to go? Will I be able to learn in large lecture halls? These questions are all answered at U of I. There is a very useful bus system at U of I that most students utilize every day. Bus schedules are handed out at Quad day, but if you need to know how to get from a specific place to another at a certain time, hop on cumtd.com and enter your beginning and end positions and time at which you must arrive. This website will find you the perfect route that will bring you where you need to go when you need to be there with step-by-step directions of when to board and get off specific buses. Want to keep off the freshman fifteen but need to get somewhere in a hurry? Instead of walking, ride your bike. There are hundreds of bike racks around campus, and you can easily travel anywhere using the bike lanes on the busier streets. As far as friends go, I have already previously mentioned that you will make a ton of friends as long as you get involved in SOMETHING on campus (which you all definitely should). These smaller groups will keep you connected with whomever you would like. There are a bunch of maps on the Illinois website to help you figure out where your classes will be, and most buildings have bus stops right in front of them. For general education courses, you will most likely be put in large lecture halls. The solution? Sit in the center toward the front (preferably within the first four rows). This way, the class seems smaller because you are closer to the professor, and the professor teaches and connects with those he can easily make eye contact with., 797333=One tradition is Wear a hijab Day. It happens in October where women are given a Hijab to wear all day, no matter the ethnicity, to see how they are treated by others. At the end of the day, you can attend a meeting that discusses what happen and possibly be interviewed., 521512=Over 3,000 registered student organizations including groups like the Squirrel Watching Club, Cigar Club, and October Lovers Club., 503679=There are more than 1100 RSOs on campus, there is something for everyone!!!, 25906=Fun fact: this campus has over 1200 student clubs and organizations! How crazy! Just to name a few of the more... memorable ones: I Love Squirrels Club, People Against Pants who wear shorts year round, and The Rodeo Club., 310078=There is so much to do on campus! There are over 1000 clubs, so virtually anyone can find a group of people to hang out with!, 243952=Getting into U of I is not overly difficult, but it is becoming so over the years (68% acceptance rate in 2010 to 60% in 2014). My suggestion for upcoming students is to do well on the ACT/SAT (30/2000) and don't try to go overboard once you've reached that limit. With extracurriculars, and a decent GPA (3.3~3.5) you should be able to get into UIUC. The college essays are also not too difficult, fairly doable., 70671=I have lived in this town my whole life, so I didn't think that attending class here would be very different for me. In a way it isn't; I still drive to campus and live in my house, but other than that, it is a whole new experience. The thing that stuck out to me the most during my first week of school was how friendly everyone was. Everyone was genuinely interested in at least knowing the basics about you (where you're from, what you're studying, etc.), and people would go out of their way to introduce themselves to you. The actual learning experience is great too, because like I said above, the class is what you make of it. Staying on top of things is the easiest way to a no-sweat good grade. Obviously college isn't completely about grades and academics. You're living in a community made-up of thousands of your peers who share the same interests and thoughts about social life. That being said there is something for everyone. The ARC (Activities and Recreation Center) is hands-down the best gym I've ever been too (and being an athlete I've seen quite a few gymnasiums in my my day). The cost of attending is included in your tuition so you only need to remember to bring your I-card to start playing basketball, swim, lift weights, or run. There are also intramurals for almost every activities you can imagine. I am currently involved with the Equestrian Club which offers both Western and Hunter Jumper lessons and competes again other colleges. The nightlife is always awesome. During the first few weeks of school in the fall the fraternities start looking for recruits and they have awesome parties every weekend. After those first few weeks one frat or another might have a huge party every weekend (Tau Kappa Epsilon has a 6000+ person party in October called Blooze Bash; Alpha Chi Lambda, Omega Delta, and another frat have Nightmare on Third St Halloween Weekend with 8000+ in attendance and performance artists as big and Chip Tha Ripper, just to give you some ideas). There are always the bars as an option, too. There are 10 really popular bars on campus full of dancing, great music, and great social opportunities (In Champaign the bars at 19+ to enter, 21+ to drink; Urbana they are 18+ to enter, 21+ to drink, unfortunately the only bar in Urbana on campus is the Canopy Club). A few of my favorite are the Clybourne, Joe's Brewery, and Red Lion. Murphy's Pub is another of my favorites and is much more casual. Don't feel like being surrounded by a seemingly endless crowd of people? Stay in with some friends with your dorm, go see a movie at Savoy 16 or The Beverly, or walk around campus, I promise you'll find something fun happening., 324285=There is always something to do on campus! I would definitely suggest getting involved in some type of group. There is so much to choose from; besides the many academic clubs, there are clubs that you wouldn't even think of. For example, one of the clubs I am in is October Lover's club: a club for people who love to do activities in October! Also, being at a big school like this promotes a lot of school pride. You will always see someone sporting the orange and blue. Not to mention, the sporting events are always fun to go to!, 201203=There are 1,000 clubs for the students here on campus. These range from october lovers, to Pre law. Each club hosts events and really tries to get members involved. Before the first day of class there is quad day where all the clubs attend, and new and old students get the chance to explore all clubs provided., 567111=Fun? The fun will start when you click 'yes', I want to go to the University of Illinois. At the campus there are a million of things to do. With of 1000 RSO (registered student organizations), it is near impossible to not find a group of people will similar interests. Whether you want to play underwater hockey, paintball, write music, form a study group, or simply go bowling, you will easily get involved. This is easy to get accompanied with at quad day. Joining Greek Like is also something I highly suggest. This is the biggest greek college in the nation, it is almost sacrilegious to not become involved. Greek life will involve you in many inter-murals, philanthropy events, service projects, and intense parties. There are tons of fields for soccer, beach volleyball, football, basketball, tennis, badminton, racquetball, boxing, and dancing setup across campus.}",

U of I definitely knows how to party, but the academics are very challenging, and I have seen everyone that I knew did not care drop out. Do not waste your money on this school if you are not going to fight until graduation. It is definitely hard work. This school is PERFECT for students that are both hard working, social, and good time managers! Tips for prospective students There are so many different things that you will learn in your college experience. Here are some tips that will hopefully make your transition a bit smoother! -When you move in, do not be afraid to go around your floor and introduce yourself to people! It is totally normal to knock on someone's door",
