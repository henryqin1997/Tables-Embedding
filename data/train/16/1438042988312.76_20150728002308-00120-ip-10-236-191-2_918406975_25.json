It's a moderatecollege really geared towards anyone who really wants to come. Tips for prospective students This college has the kind of community feel that you might get in a high school, but grow up and act like adults, not high schoolers. I mean, have fun, be happy, but be mature. Nothing ruins a day at college than thinking you can still goof off but you learn pretty quick you really can't. Bang for the buck I think this college has a wonderful value. Most professors are experts in their field, and they care about their students, which motivates the students",
