Login to rate or flag the reviews Julie from Glen Rock, NJ 12/30/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 5 out of 6 people found this review useful. 3 of 34 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Loyola is great for students who try hard, but who focus more on taking what they learn in the classroom, and applying it to the outside world through service.

However, I have learned that the most rewarding thing is not earning the A, it is rather realizing that something has been learned, and this something can be used to change the world for the better. Tips for prospective students Engage yourself in a lot of community service,",
