However, some of the La Grandians (students who went to high school in La Grande) are pretty creative and take you on some crazy rides. We usually find ourselves in the dorms awake at like 4:00am just being crazy and loud. The town is so small that the police know where all the parties are at so I would recommend staying away from the party scene and sticking to sober craziness. Late night/early morning Denny's trips are a favorite of ours; the staff there are great and allow us to be obnoxious college students with nothing to do. Also, there are hundreds of events on campus hosted by your RA's, the different clubs and organizations, and occasionally outside events so try to support your college community and attend a few workshops or crazy events. Chances are you'll meet someone cool and learn a few things while enjoying a 100ft waterslide, making duct tape flowers, and watching hypnotists make a fool out of your new friends. On campus events are once in a lifetime experiences I'm glad that I got to go to., 173029=There are two places to eat on campus: Mac Grills and the Cafeteria. Mac Grills is half convenient store, breakfast and fast food joint, and has a starbucks. It is a nice lounging area to eat in and on certain days there is open mike night. The Cafeteria has excellent quality food with no limit on seconds. Usually serves pizza, some sort of fast food, and a more healthy style meal that contains vegetables and most of the food groups. There is a salad and sandwich making bar in the middle, drinks on the end, a little fridge to get ice cream, and a small area called the bakery that has a variety of yummy treats on any given day. It opens at 11:30 am so you have to go to Mac Grills around as early as 7:30 am to get breakfast. MAc grills is closed on weekends so you have to wait for food till the Cafeteria opens. Cafeteria also opens at 5:30 pm for dinner. At 7:30 pm Mac grills opens for late night dinner., 14298=Try and apply for housing as soon as possible - I applied in December after I heard that I was accepted, but you will probably be safe applying between January and March. I would STRONGLY recommend paying extra for the nicer dorms (Daughtery/North, Alikut) because I have heard horrible stories about the lack of cleanliness in the public bathrooms. If you are a person who doesn't handle sharing a room with someone well or have a bad experience in the dorms, go for a North/Daugherty Single room. It is only $600/year more, and the room is spacious, quiet, and you know that no one will be in while you are gone stealing your belongings. While the financial aid program is wonderful, Apply for tons scholarships and grants. Any chance you have at paying for your education now with donated money rather than later is one to take., 203777=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 175085=Seems to be very good and the classes are very smooth with most professors and it is quite lax. We start at the end of September and those who are in Music have mid-terms about the end of October. Depending on your degree, you are kept busy, but you usually end up with a lot of free time. I am taking the maximum credit hours and I still find time to do other things., 73954=Those who like small class sizes, a country atmosphere, and need 1:1 learning opportunities.}",

The college is diverse, friendly and affordable. It also sports a small town feel, which is appealing to those avoiding the rush and apathy of the city. Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid to reach out of your comfort zone, the opportunities are limitless. Talk with your teachers and get help when you need. The staff are always friendly,",
