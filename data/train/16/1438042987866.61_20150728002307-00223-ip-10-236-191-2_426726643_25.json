In all he finished with 24, together with three centuries, the first of which came in 2001 when Bangladesh were facing a massive first-innings score by Zimbabwe. The 108 was a largely forgotten innings, but it easily showed how Bashar was the best batsman of a faltering generation of talented cricketers. His next Test ton came in 2003, against Pakistan in Karachi, and kept Bangladesh in the game, while the last century came in a well-earned draw against West Indies in Gros Islet. However, despite his attacking style he underperformed in ODIs, averaging less than 22 despite playing 111 matches., 60574=He later joined the rebel Indian Cricket League, shaking Bangladesh cricket to its core in 2008, but he was rehabilitated; in 2011, he was appointed as one of three national selectors.

His greatest game as captain was the five-wicket win over Australia in an ODI in Cardiff in 2005, considered one of the greatest sporting upsets. He was also in charge when Bangladesh won their first Test (and series) - in Chittagong against Zimbabwe in 2004. He led Bangladesh during the 2007 World Cup, the country's most successful campaign in which they beat India and South Africa., 80310=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 60376=As the big runs dried up and the clamour for the removal of a non-contributing captain grew in the media, Bashar was replaced by Mohammad Ashraful in 2007., 64711=Feb 26, 2013}",
