Indeed, the legal recognition of same-sex marriage has emerged as one of the most socially, politically, and legally divisive issues of the day. While most reactions to this new form of marriage and family formation have been intense and vocal, many commentators as well as the general public have little factual knowledge about same-sex marriage.

In modern times same-sex marriage did not exist until the twenty-first century when an increasing number of countries began permitting same-sex couples to marry legally. In addition, beginning in the late twentieth century there has been a growing global movement to regard marriage as a fundamental human right to be extended to same-sex couples.

She found that getting married for many older same-sex couples is even harder than for younger same-sex couples, because older cohorts of same-sex couples could not easily dispel the internalized beliefs \u201csuch as same-sex couples could never marry and marriage was not for them due to the fact that they have lived most of their lives through years of homophobia and heterosexism, which has affected their worldviews. Moreover, some older same-sex couples, particularly those in long-term relationships, may already view themselves as married and thus do not initially see the need for the legal marriage.\u201d (Humble, Aine, M., 2013. \u201cMoving from Ambivalence to Certainty: Older Same-Sex Couples Marry in Canada.\u201d Canadian Journal on Aging 32(2): 131-144) Pamela J.

She found that \u201call of the couples that she had interviewed with expressed some way in which same-sex marriage improved or strengthened their romantic relationship, and others expressed that it contributed to a closer emotional bond between them. However, some participants expressed that they were stressed out during their marriage decision process or planning their weddings, because they lacked support from their families-of-origin.\u201d (Lannutti, Pamela, J. 2007. \u201c\u201dThis is Not a Lesbian Wedding\u201d: Examining Same-Sex Marriage and Bisexual-Lesbian Couples.\u201d Co-published simultaneosly in Journal of Bisexuality 7(3/4): 237-260; and: Bisexuality and Same-Sex Marriage 7(3/4): 237-260.) Pamela J. Lannutti\u2019s another study examined same-sex couples\u2019 attractions to marriage and obstacles that challenged them when considering marriage. She found that the primary reason why same-sex couples decide to marry is because it would offer greater legal protections and civil benefits for their committed relationship. Another reason is that it would make it easier to bring children into their lives or protect their relationships with the children they already had. In terms of obstacles of same-sex marriage, the majority of these couples (41%) expressed that family disapproval, usually parental disapproval, was an obstacle to their marriage., 160002=Justice John Paul Stevens, who retired in 2010, was on hand for the decision, and many of the justices\u2019 clerks took seats in the chamber, which was nearly full as the ruling was announced.

Bush., 129956=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gay-marriage-and-other-major-rulings-at-the-supreme-court/2015/06/25/ef75a120-1b6d-11e5-bd7f-4611a60dd8e5_story.html, 281703=Monday 13 July 2015 06.15 EDT Last modified on Monday 13 July 2015 11.36 EDT}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{801576=On April 25, 2015, protests were organized in downtown Baltimore, and the protests turned violent as protesters threw rocks and set fires.[42] At least 34 people were arrested, and 15 officers were injured.[10][43][44] On April 27, rioting and looting began after the funeral of Gray,[45] with two patrol cars destroyed and 15 officers reported injured.[10] Protesters looted and burned down a CVS Pharmacy location in downtown Baltimore.[46], 772980=On April 12, 2015, Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American man, was taken into custody by the Baltimore Police Department for allegedly possessing a switchblade; however, Baltimore state\u2019s attorney Marilyn J. Mosby subsequently stated \u201cThe knife was not a switchblade and is lawful under Maryland law\u201d.[2] While being transported in a police van, Gray fell into a coma and was taken to a trauma center.[3][4][5] Gray died on April 19, 2015. His death was ascribed to injuries to his spinal cord.[5] On April 21, 2015, pending an investigation of the incident, six Baltimore police officers were temporarily suspended with pay.[4], 781322=Police encountered Freddie Gray on the morning of April 12, 2015,[7] in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood of Baltimore, an area known to have high levels of home foreclosures, poverty, drug deals and violent crimes.[3][15] According to the charging documents submitted by the Baltimore police,[16] Gray attempted to flee \u201cunprovoked\u201d on foot, but police on bicycles chased and tackled Gray, found what they claimed was a switchblade in his pocket, and took him into custody at 8:40\u00a0a.m.[7][17] Two bystanders captured Gray\u2019s arrest with video recordings, showing Gray being dragged into the van by officers. A bystander with connections to Gray stated that the officers were \u201cfolding\u201d Gray\u2014with one officer bending Gray\u2019s legs backwards, and another holding Gray down by pressing a knee into Gray\u2019s neck. Another witness told the Baltimore Sun that they had witnessed Gray being beaten with batons.[7][18], 806691=Protests outside Baltimore also took place in other U.S. cities. In New York City, 143 people at Union Square were arrested on April 29, 2015 for blocking traffic and refusing to relocate. On the same day, outside the White House in Washington, D.C., nearly 500 protesters converged without an incident. In Denver, eleven people were arrested as protesters were involved in physical altercations with officers. Other protests in response to Gray\u2019s death took place in cities including Philadelphia,Minneapolis, and Portland.[61], 751398=This week in New York, another white police officer was not indicted for the death of another black man, and protests have been called. This is the case where the police officer in question choked Eric Gardner to death on the sidewalk \u00a0July 17th of this year. To be honest with you, after watching the video\u00a0I find myself wondering why he wasn\u2019t indicted. In my opinion this looks like a clear cut case of police brutality. Is it possible that the same communist agitators that flamed the Ferguson riots have manipulated events concerning the jury\u2019s decision not to indict, in order to encourage more resentment? While it may seem like a far fetched idea, it is in fact, the way \u201cpsychopolitical operatives\u201d (communists) operate. This could very well be an expert application of the Hegelian Dialectic at work;create the problem, cause a crisis and then offer the solution. In this case the solution Obama wants may be a nationalized police force., 708622=Posted on May 2, 2015.

At 8:46 a.m., Gray was unloaded in order to be placed in leg irons because police said he was \u201cirate.\u201d A later stop, recorded by a private camera, shows the van stopped at a grocery store. At 8:59 a.m., a second prisoner was placed in the vehicle while officers checked on Gray\u2019s condition, and 27 minutes later the van made its final stop so paramedics could transport an unconscious Gray to the hospital.[19] He was taken to the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in a coma.[3][20] The statement of charges filed by Officer Garrett Miller against Gray accused him of possessing a switchblade. Miller wrote, \u201cThe defendant was arrested without force or incident.\u201d[6] Officers also reported \u201cthat he suffered a medical emergency during transport\u201d.[7][21] The media has suggested the possibility of a so-called \u201crough ride\u201c\u2014where a handcuffed prisoner is placed without a seatbelt in an erratically driven vehicle\u2014as a contributing factor in Gray\u2019s injury.[22][23], 756211=http://gopthedailydose.com/2014/12/10/obamas-push-for-that-national-police-force/, 796722=As of May 1st, five of the six officers were in custody.[33], 805299=At a press conference, Baltimore\u2019s mayor announced there would be a citywide curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.[54][55][56] School trips were canceled until mid-May,[57][58] and Baltimore\u2019s city schools were closed on April 28.[59] In addition, both the University of Maryland campus in downtown Baltimore and the Mondawmin Mall were closed early.[60], 776686=On May 1, 2015, Baltimore prosecutors ruled that Gray\u2019s death was a homicide, and that his arrest was illegal because the alleged switchblade was a legal-sized pocket knife. The prosecutors stated that they had probable cause to file criminal charges against the six police officers who were believed to be involved in his death.[2] One officer was charged with second degree depraved-heart murder, and others were charged with crimes ranging from manslaughter to illegal arrest.[2], 798484=Public reaction to the death has drawn parallels to the response to the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, as part of a larger string of controversial uses of force by police officers in the United States.[35][36] As of April 30, 2015, 22 demonstrations had been held nationwide in direct response to Gray\u2019s death or in solidarity with Baltimore.[37], 792118=On May 1, 2015, the Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office ruled that Freddie Gray\u2019s death was a homicide, and that they had probable cause to file criminal charges against the six officers involved. Marilyn Mosby, the state\u2019s attorney for Baltimore City, said that the Baltimore police had acted illegally and that \u201cNo crime had been committed\u201d (by Freddie Gray).[28] Mosby said that Gray \u201csuffered a critical neck injury as a result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained inside the BPD wagon.\u201d[29][30] It was also ruled that the arrest of Gray was false imprisonment, because he was carrying a pocket knife of legal size, and not the switchblade police claimed he had possessed at the time of his arrest.[31], 790325=On April 30, 2015, Kevin Moore, the man who filmed Gray\u2019s arrest, was arrested at gunpoint following \u201charassment and intimidation\u201d by police. Moore stated to have cooperated with police and gave over his video of Gray\u2019s arrest for investigation. He claimed, despite aiding in the investigation, his photo was made public by police for further questioning.[27] The same day, medical examiners reported Gray sustained more injuries as a result of him slamming into the inside of the transport van, \u201capparently breaking his neck; a head injury he sustained matches a bolt in the back of the van\u201d.

A major protest in downtown Baltimore on April 25, 2015, turned violent, resulting in 34 arrests and injuries to 15 police officers.[10] After Gray\u2019s funeral on April 27, civil unrest intensified with looting and burning of local businesses and a CVS drug store, culminating with a state of emergency declaration by GovernorLarry Hogan and Maryland National Guard deployment to Baltimore., 786557=In the following week, according to the Gray family attorney, Gray suffered from total cardiopulmonary arrest at least once but was resuscitated without ever regaining consciousness. He remained in a coma, and underwent extensive surgery in an effort to save his life.[3] According to his family, he lapsed into a coma with three fractured vertebrae, injuries to his \u201cvoice box\u201d, and his spine \u201c80% severed\u201d at his neck. Police confirmed that the spinal injury led to Gray\u2019s death.[4][5] The attorney also disputed the claim that Gray had been in possession of a switchblade, and stated that it was actually a \u201cpocketknife of legal size\u201d.[24] He died on April 19, 2015, a week after his arrest.[17], 768053=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2015/05/01/city-states-attorney-says-freddie-grays-arrest-illegal-has-enough-evidence-for-charges/, 798339=Protesters at a police station near the site of Gray\u2019s arrest on April 25, 758790=On April 12, when 25-year-old Freddie Gray first made eye contact with a city police officer and ran away, officers chased him down and arrested him at 1700 Pressbury Street., 799388=On April 18, 2015, hundreds of people participated in a protest outside the Baltimore Police Department.[38] Three days later, on April 21, 2015, according to Reuters, \u201c[h]undreds of demonstrators gathered in Baltimore\u201d, protesting Gray\u2019s death.[18]The next day, Gene Ryan, the president of the local lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, expressed sympathy for the Gray family, but criticized the \u201crhetoric of protests\u201d and suggested that \u201cthe images seen on television look and sound much like a lynch mob.\u201d William Murphy, attorney for the Gray family, demanded an \u201cimmediate apology and a retraction\u201d.[39] Ryan defended his statement two days later, while admitting that the wording was poor.[40] Charles M. Blow of The New York Times, reminded of a column he wrote several years ago, said that comparing protests to lynch mobs was too extreme because it inflames racial tensions by belittling the significance of the history of lynching in the United States.[41]}",
