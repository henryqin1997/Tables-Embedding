You may verify the additional calculations that have been done to show the masses of hydrogen product that would be expected. We'll fill in the remaining spots below. Thus With practice this kind of problem can be solved in one step by concentrating on the units. The appropriate stoichiometric ratio will convert moles of H2O to moles of NaSi and the molar mass will convert moles of NaSi to grams of NaSi. A schematic road map for the one-step calculation can be written as This is a reasonably sized cartridge (about 5.67 lb).

The problem gives the mass of NaSi and asks for the mass of Na2Si2O5 that would result from it's complete reaction with water. Thinking the problem through before trying to solve it, we realize that the molar mass of NaSi could be used to calculate the amount of NaSi consumed. Then we need a stoichiometric ratio to get the amount of Na2Si2O5 produced. Finally, the molar mass of Na2Si2O5 permits calculation of the mass of Na2Si2O5. Symbolically nNaSi Now we can complete the table above by adding the amount of Na2Si2O5 (25.18 mol, half the amount of NaSi) and its mass, 4033 g (or about 8.9 lb).
