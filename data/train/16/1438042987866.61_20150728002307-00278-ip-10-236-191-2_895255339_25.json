            "it is a pretty challenging course load. it has been named in the top 50 educations worth the price, and its a pretty expensive school. they make sure that they get experts in the fields they teach.",
            "make sure you can stand being in a christian environment, and know you cant have cars as freshmen.",

Learn time management before you go to school, waking up at 7:30 in the morning for high school was easy, but for some reason in College it's way harder. School work overloads but with the right organization and proper mindset you can successfully pass all your classes! My knowledge for you incoming freshman is, don't worry about the little things. God is there to provide and support you with everything. Just trust in His name and listen to what He has to tell you!, 34042=Apply for the Cal-Grant early, as well as completing your FAFSA before the end of February. March is the date when a lot of scholarships require you have your FAFSA completed in order to be recognized which includes the Cal-Grant. I missed the Cal-Grant this year because I was a week late on completing my FAFSA., 190304=The campus is located in a really nice suburban area, so crime isn't a big issue. However, since there is public property on campus, people are essentially free to come and go as the like until 12:00 am., 254445=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
