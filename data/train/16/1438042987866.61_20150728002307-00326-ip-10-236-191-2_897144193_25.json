There are currently around 1600 students, so the class sizes are small and the professors know their students. The school provides many opportunities for the women, such as a variety of majors, a large network to aid in job applications, and a chance to take classes at the other two schools., 195529=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students This college is great for students who love to excel in school, but also for those students who need a little extra help in the classroom. Professors are really nice. Make sure to get their email though because that is the best way to get a hold of them. The small class sizes make it easy to talk amongst the class and since it is mainly girls, some feel more comfortable. Plus, you get to go to class in your pajamas!! Tips for prospective students I was a freshman last year and lived in Le Mans Hall, which is a dorm for any age student. To first year students I would recommend living in McCandless since it is primarily freshmen living there. You get to meet a whole bunch of freshman and it makes it easier. I regret not choosing to live there because I felt like I would have made a lot more friends. I know, I know, all the other dorms are so much more lovely, but in the end you will agree that you think it was one of the best decisions you could ever make. As for the classes, they are tough! Make sure you do your assigned reading. Don't be afraid to ask a professor for help either. They are more than willing to work with you on whatever issue you may be having.",
