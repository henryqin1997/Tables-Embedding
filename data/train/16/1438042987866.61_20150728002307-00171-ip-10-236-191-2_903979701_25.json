Academic wise this school has great teachers with a defined goal in mind of getting students jobs and helping them become better people and students. Overall it is a school that is up and coming and has a the great name of the University of Tennessee to back it up., 109583=Dorm life is sweet! Period. I will be staying in University Village which is Freshmen priority. A head's up, SIGN UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Especially if you want University Village, they tend to fill up fast. I was lucky enough to decide early that I want to attend Martin so I did housing back in November and I luckily got the place I wanted. Any of the resident halls are a good choice, however., 110674=Before I applied, I toured Martin in the fall of 2011. I kept telling myself I would never attend college here since it was so close to home. Once I stepped foot on Martin, something just felt right. I was in love with the small, easy campus and knew right away that's where I wanted to go. People complain all of the time that it is too close to home, but it is close enough when you can come home, but you don't have to if you don't want to. Give it a try before you make a decision. Needless to say, I am so excited about this fall and meeting new people., 42620=I have only been a student here since August but my knowledge has definitely expanded. I love my teachers challenging us to think outside of our high school boxes and think like a college student., 2927=You should definitely come to one of the preview days that UTM holds. These give you a chance to meet many of the administration and professors in your desired major (more than likely, one of these will be your advisor), tour the beautiful campus, and check out the housing opportunities first hand. Also, don't be afraid to talk to the people in admissions and financial aid more than once; it could pay off. My first semester here, I received an extra $1500 that allowed me to take summer classes as well.}",

UTM is in a small town, but there is more to do than just study and hang out with friends. UT Martin is a very good and non-violence school to attend. I recommend everyone of my friends to pick UTM. Tips for prospective students For most of you who may want to come to UTM, I recommend that you be prepared for the freedom that may come with going out on your own. You must be prepared to go to class every time because attendance is crucial as well as making time to study; save your money at every available opportunity, having fun with friends doesn't need to be expensive Bang for the buck",
