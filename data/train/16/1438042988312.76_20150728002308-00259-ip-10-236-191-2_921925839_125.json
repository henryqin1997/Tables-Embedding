            "There's so much to do at UWG. Go to a sports game (in the newly built stadium). The gym offers not only sports courts and a running track but a 3 story rock wall as well. Join a club. Go to housing events. Or leave campus and go shopping and to the movies. Atlanta, Georgia's capital city is less than an hour away for a short road trip.",
            "UWG offers a number of dining experiences, from the campus dining hall to more popular food and coffee chains, there's something for everyone. Good food for a quick snack in between class as well as numerous choices for those who choose to live on campus.",
            "Get to know your RA. They will definitely be checking in. Dorm life is a major part of making friends. Sharing space with strangers takes some adjusting but what better way to get to know one another than to dive right in and say hi?",
            "Just like at any other school, some professors are better than others, but even the largest classes at UWG don't make you feel like you're a fish in an entire of ocean. Most are personable and helpful and want nothing more than to see you succeed.",
            "Get involved! Join clubs. Rush for fraternities and sorroties. Use the resources the school offers. Make the experience fun but productive. These are the best years of your life and getting an education is only the beginning of what college has to offer.",
            "Set in a town with both urban appeal and rural charm, the University of West Georgia was the perfect place to begin my college education. Its scenic campus was a mix of both historic and new learning facilities that set the foundations for my education and became home to me very quickly. I would recommend UWG for anyone wanting to experience a larger school that is more about education than numbers."

West Georgia has a great nursing program as well. Tips for prospective students As I have stated before, use your time wisely! The biggest change from high school to college is the responsibility. Set a pace for yourself and you'll do fine. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE! Procrastination leads to the overwhelming feeling and eventually becomes your enemy. The website www.ratemyprofessor.com is really handy. Check it out. Bang for the buck I like the fact that West Georgia isn't too expensive, and so do my parents. Am enjoying being here I am a commuter, just like a lot of other students that attend West Georgia, so for me, it",
