The FTIR spectrum in FIG. 2 of the nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite powder calcined at 550\ufffd C. was similar to that of the as-synthesized hydroxyapatite precursor gel, although the peak at 875 cm\u22121 associated with HPO4 2\u2212 was reduced. The PO4 3\u2212 peaks near 1030-1090 cm\u22121 and at 560-600 cm\u22121also became more well-resolved after calcination indicating that the hydroxyapatite structure became more defined. With increasing temperature, the broad band at 3000-3400 cm\u22121 became less prominent as water was removed. The peak intensities of CO3 2\u2212 around 1400 cm\u22121 and H2O at 1630 cm\u22121 were substantially reduced.}",

A precipitation method was used and material of average grain size of from about 150-700 nm recovered. However, Jarcho, et al. report low volume fraction of pores, and report considerable grain growth during sintering even at firing temperatures of 1000\ufffd C. Jarcho, et al. achieved 99% density in some cases, but using a technique that can be impractical for forming desired shapes. M. Akao, et al., in \u201cMechanical Properties of Sintered Hydroxyapatite for Prosthetic Applications\u201d, J. Mater.

The compressive strength of the sintered hydroxy apatite was approximately 3-6 times as strong as that of cortical bone., 42637=This non-provisional application claims the benefit under Title 35, U.S.C. \ufffd119(e) of co-pending U.S. provisional application serial No. 60/035,535, filed Jan. 16, 1997, entitled \u201cNanocrystalline Apatites and Composites, Prostheses Incorporating Them, and Method for Their Production\u201d by Jackie Y. Ying et al., incorporated herein by reference., 252641=Aqueous solutions of 0.075 M to 0.300 M (NH4)2HPO4 and 0.500 M Ca(NO3)2 were prepared so that the Ca:P ratio varied from 6.67 to 1.67 and were mixed with a magnetic stirrer. The pH of the (NH4)2HPO4 aqueous solution was adjusted by adding 10 ml of concentrated NH4OH. 300 ml of a 0.500 M solution of Ca(NO3)2 was added to 300 ml of 0.300 M aqueous (NH4)2HPO4 at 3 ml/min. A gas stream composed of 5% CO2 and 95% N2 was bubbled through the precipitate immediately after addition or 6 hours after addition for 18 hours. Some trials were magnetically stirred for 100 hours and aged at room temperature, while others were aqueously aged for 50 hours followed by 50 hours of hydrothermal treatment at 180\ufffd C. The white precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 15 minutes. After decanting, the precipitate was redispersed in a solution of distilled water and NH4OH by magnetically stirring for 20 minutes; this procedure was repeated two more times with decreasing amounts of NH4OH, and two times with ethanol. The gel was air dried at room temperature for 24 hours, and then dried in a 150\ufffd C. oven for an additional 24 hours. The gel was then finely ground with an alumina mortar and pestle. The ground powders were then heat treated in air at 550\ufffd C., 700\ufffd C. and 900\ufffd C. with a heating rate of 10\ufffd C./min, and a dwell time of 2 hours., 258921=The above examples demonstrate superior processes and products resulting from densifications of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite. The grain sizes of calcined samples varied from 30 nm to 100 nm depending how pH, aging time, reaction and aging temperature, Ca(NO3)2 addition rate, precursor concentration, and grinding method were controlled, while the grain sizes of conventional hydroxyapatite were on a micron scale. For example, the surface area of one sample of the invention after calcination at 550\ufffd C. is 159.5 m2/g while the conventional sample after calcination at 550\ufffd C. has a very small surface area of 5.4 m2/g. The sample of the invention retained phase uniformity after calcination at 550\ufffd C., but the conventional sample began to transform into tricalcium phosphate at 550\ufffd C. with substantial conversion to tricalcium phosphate and calcia by 700\ufffd C. In a sample of the invention 96% of the theoretical density was obtained at a low sintering temperature of 1100\ufffd C. by pressureless sintering for nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite which was stable up to 1300\ufffd C. However, the conventional sample achieved only 70% of the theoretical density at 1200\ufffd C. with decomposition into tri-calcium phosphate. Furthermore, the densified conventional sample contained large pores and microcracks. Our nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite has high purity and phase homogeneity as well as superior sinterability compared to the conventionally prepared hydroxyapatite. When our nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite was sintered using either colloidal or hot pressing, 99% theoretical bulk density with a grain size of less than 250 nm can be obtained. Dense nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite compacts further possessed a compressive strength as high as 745 MPa, while the conventional micron-sized hydroxyapatite compacts from a similar pressureless sintering treatment possessed a compressive strength of 150 MPa. Additionally, further reinforcement of the hydroxyapatite can be accomplished by introducing a secondary dispersoid such as zirconia which would greatly improve the toughness and chemical stability of hydroxyapatite by pinning the mobility of any intergranular and intragranular defects. A dense composite of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite and 10 wt % nanocrystalline 3 mol % Y2O3-doped ZrO2 possessed an even higher compressive strength of 1020 MPa. With more complete characterization, the densified nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite and hydroxyapatite-zirconia composites can easily be developed into dental and orthopedic weight-bearing implants. Furthermore, the processing of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite can be adapted to synthesize a nanocrystalline carbonate apatite illustrating the versatility of our process. This process can also be used to selectively synthesize Type A and Type B carbonate apatite as well as to control the degree of substitution of the carbonate ion into the apatite structure., 160255=pH can affect chemical precipitation by altering the solubility of the precipitate; the solubility of hydroxyapatite decreases as pH increases. As a result, nucleation would be favored decreasing crystallite size. Furthermore, different pH's affect agglomeration by inducing a surface charge on the particles in solution. Similar surface charges in the solution of the particles repel each other reducing agglomeration in the solution. However, the same polar solvents that prevented agglomeration during precipitation introduce surface hydroxyl groups onto ceramic particles during the drying process. As the ceramic gel dries, the surface hydroxyl groups promote agglomeration of particles. It is therefore desirable to use a nonpolar solvent, to wash the gel in order to remove the surface hydroxyl groups. Finally, the different pHs during the chemical precipitation are expected to affect crystal morphology, and the morphology becomes increasingly rod-like, or spherical to needle-like, with increasing pH, for example to aspect ratios ranging from about 2.3:1 to 5.9:1. Tanahashi et al. reported that the solution pH greatly influenced the growth rate and morphology of hydroxyapatite and that fibrous hydroxyapatite could be prepared at high pH. Hydroxyapatite synthesized through hydrothermal treatment at a pH of 11 to 12 also resulted in nanometer-sized rod-like crystals. However, the addition of glycerin during the synthesis confounded the relationship between high pH and the synthesis of rod-like hydroxyapatite, with the effect of additives on the synthesis of rod-like hydroxyapatite. The synthesis conditions of the calcined hydroxyapatite powders used to determine the effect of NH4OH are presented in Table 9., 244522=A 2.00 M ZrOCl2.8 H2O (3 mol % Y2O3) stock solution is prepared from reagent grade ZrOCl2.8 H2O and Y2O3 and deionized water. The stock solution is allowed to stir for 24 hours prior to use. 25 ml of the 2.00 M ZrOCl2.8 H2O (3 mol % Y2O3) is pipetted 225 ml of ethanol under constant stirring. This working solution is allowed to stir for 30 minutes. Next, a base solution is prepared by pipetting 100 ml of ammonium hydroxide into 250 ml of ethanol under constant stirring and by allowing the solution to stir for at least 15 minutes. The precipitation reaction occurs when the 0.200 M working solution is added to a base solution at 15 ml/min under constant stirring. The solution is allowed to stir and age for 24 hours. Next, the solution is centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 20 minutes and decanted. The resulting gel is redispersed in ethanol and centrifuged 4 more times under the same conditions to quench the reaction and to remove all the chloride ions. The gel is then ground with a pestel in a preheated mortar until a fine powder is obtained. This powder is allowed to dry in a 110\ufffd C. oven overnight. Finally, the powder is calcined at 550\ufffd C. for 2 hours with a ramp rate of 10\ufffd C./min., 243301=Aqueous solutions of 0.300 M (NH4)2HPO4 and 0.500 M Ca(NO3)2 were prepared so that the Ca:P ratio was 10:6 and were mixed with a magnetic stirrer. The pH of the (NH4)2HPO4 aqueous solution was varied by adding 30 ml of concentrated NH4OH. 300 ml of a 0.500 M solution of Ca(NO3)2 was added to 300 ml of 0.300 M aqueous (NH4)2HPO4 at 10 ml/min. The combined solutions were magnetically stirred for 12 hours and aged at room temperature. The white precipitate was collected by filtration with a Buchner funnel and washed at least three times with distilled water with a decreasing concentration of NH4OH each time and finally with ethanol. The gel was air dried at room temperature for 24 hours and then dried in a 150\ufffd C. oven for 12 hours. The gel was then finely ground with an alumina mortar and pestle. The ground powders were then heat treated in air at 550\ufffd C. with a heating rate of 10\ufffd C./min, and a dwell time of 2 hours., 248118=TEM micrographs indicated that there were no glassy phases at the grain boundaries showing that the nanocomposite achieved good densification without the precipitation of undesirable secondary phases. Zirconia grains were intragranularly dispersed within the hydroxyapatite matrix. With smaller grain sizes, a more mechanically robust material is obtained. The pure nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite possessed a compressive strength of 745 MPa while the conventional micron-sized hydroxyapatite possessed a compressive strength of 150 MPa. Further reinforcement of the nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite with a secondary dispersoid of nanocrystalline zirconia resulted in an even higher compressive strength of 1020 MPa. This improvement in compressive strength is believed to be due to the intragranular toughening of the nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite matrix by the nano-ZrO2 dispersoids., 43573=Notice: More than one reissue application has been filed for the reissue of U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,591. The reissue applications are U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/044,801 filed Jan. 11, 2002, 10/863,863 filed Jun. 7, 2004 (the present application), and 12/749,299 filed Mar. 29, 2010. 10/863,863 is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/044,801, and 12/749,299 is a continuation of 10/863,863., 49175=Although many ceramic compositions have been tested as implants to repair various parts of the body, few have achieved human clinical application. Problems associated with ceramic implants typically involve the lack of a stable interface with connective tissue, or a lack of matching of the mechanical behavior of the implant with the tissue to be replaced, or both (L. L. Hench, \u201cBioceramics: from Concept to Clinic\u201d, J. Am. Ceram. Soc., 74, 1487-1510 (1991)). In the case of bioinert bioceramic materials, only a mechanical interlock is obtained, and if the mechanical fixation between the surrounding tissue and implant is not strong enough, then loosening of the bioceramic can occur causing necrosis of the surrounding tissue along with total implant failure. For example, when alumina or zirconia implants are implanted with a tight mechanical fit within the body and movement does not occur at the interface with tissue, they are clinically successful. However, if movement occurs, the fibrous capsule surrounding the implant can grow to become several hundred microns thick and the implant can loosen, leading to clinical failure., 43014=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 10/044,801, filed Jan. 11, 2002, which is a reissue of U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,591, issued Jan. 11, 2000, entitled NANOCRYSTALLINE APATITES AND COMPOSITES, PROSTHESES INCORPORATING THEM, AND METHOD FOR THEIR PRODUCTION, which claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/035,535, filed Jan. 16, 1997, all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 89775=In one set of embodiments the method in the invention involves precipitating apatite from a solvent by adding a calcium salt to a phosphate source. Suitable calcium salts and phosphate sources would be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the present disclosure. In one embodiment apatite is precipitated from a solvent containing a calcium salt in a concentration of less than 1 M, preferably less than 0.5 M, and more preferably from about 0.16 M to about 2.1 M. Preferred methods include precipitating apatite from a solvent containing a calcium salt and phosphate source in a molar ratio of about 10:6. A separate set of embodiments involves mixing a calcium source and a phosphate source in any way., 100375=A series of experiments were conducted to determine the feasibility of synthesizing nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite and to determine the optimal pH, aging temperature, aging time, and heat treatment where the optimal hydroxyapatite is the sample that possesses the highest green and sintered densities. Reagent grade Ca(NO3)2.4H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 were used as starting materials. Aqueous solutions of (NH4)2HPO4 (NHP) and Ca(NO3)2 (CaN) were prepared such that the Ca:P ratio was 10:6. 0.300 M (NH4)2HPO4 and 0.500 M Ca(NO3)2 as well as 0.100 M (NH4)2HPO4 and 0.167 M Ca(NO3)2 were prepared. These solutions were mixed with a magnetic stirrer. The pH of the NH4)2HPO4 aqueous solution was varied by adding concentrated NH4OH. 300 ml of a 0.500 M solution of Ca(NO3)2 was added to 300 ml of 0.300 M aqueous (NH4)2HPO4, or 900 ml of a 0.167 M solution of Ca(NO3)2 was added to 900 ml of 0.100 M aqueous (NH4)2HPO4 solution at a rate from 2 ml/min to 48 ml/min; the number of moles of precursors was constant in both set of reactions. The combined solution was magnetically stirred for 12 or 100 hours and aged at 0\ufffd C., room temperature, or 70\ufffd C., The white precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 15 minutes. After decanting, the precipitate was redispersed in a distilled water and NH4OH solution by magnetically stirring for 20 minutes; this procedure was repeated two more times with decreasing amounts of NH4OH and a fourth and final time with ethanol. The gel was air dried at room temperature for 24 hours and then dried in a 150\ufffd C. oven for an additional 24 hours. The gel was then finely ground with an alumina mortar and pestle. Instead of air drying the gel, the gel was also wet ground. Wet grinding is a procedure by which a gel is ground in a heated mortar and pestle until the gel becomes a fine powder. The ground powders we re then heat treated in air at 550\ufffd C., 700\ufffd C. and 900\ufffd C. with a heating rate of 10\ufffd C./min, and a dwell time of 2 hours.}",
