Only wish they had a men's soccer program., 19222=I entered Bakersfield College in the Fall of 2008 and so far I have learned a lot about the whole college experience. Bakersfield College is not one of those colleges where they do not require you to attend class regularly. If you miss the equivalent of two weeks you will be dropped, since space is limited. It is required that you take a Student Development class before 15 units so you know what you are doing and where you are going in the college experience. That class teaches you how to deal with various issues, instructs you on what classes to take, and helps with the transferring process if that's an option for you. At Bakersfield College you can receive a certificate of specialization or completeness, Associate of Arts and Science. Or if you prefer you can work on your general education requirements for transferring to an university, private or state., 64302=there are two sections to the school's cafeteria where you can buy food: one is the fast food section which is opened from 8:00am to 7:30 or 8:00pm. the second section offers healthier choices like salads, subs, sandwiches etc. both sections are good, but if you don't like the food choices at school there are many restaurants around the campus where you could go eat with your friends., 18008=Bakersfield is the cheap[est school in the whole nation at twenty-six dollars per unit. This new price is due to budget cuts in the state of California, taken into effect the Fall Semester of 2009. You can apply for financial aid through FAFSA for the Governor's waiver and the famous Pell grant. The only thing that will upset you is the price of textbooks which range from 100 to 200 dollars., 251945=I began Bakersfield College in 1988 after I graduated from high school. Twenty five years later I am expected to graduate with my AA degree. Its been a long journey, not consistent, but I never taken off my eyes for the end result - graduation., 8909=bakersfield college was founded in 1913 and is one of the nation's oldest continually-operating community colleges., 362196=Many Clubs:Student Organizations at Bakersfield College provide an opportunity for students with a common interest to form a membership group and develop activities/events that form a sense of community. They are active throughout the year.

May eye contact with our professor and always be respectful. At times you may not agree with him or her, but that's okay, because we are all different. The sooner you realize that - the happier you will be. I have found that different departments are accommodating because their goal is for you to succeed., 373285=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Be sure to have fun, but definitely do not spread yourself too thin. Although this is a community college, you will save thousands by getting your general education here instead of going straight to a four year university. Bakersfield College has many great teachers who will present a challenge with their classes, and most teach as if you are at a university. It helps to take one or two easy-going or fun classes so you do not stress out too much with the more challenging classes. Definitely start or join in on study groups for these more difficult classes. You will learn more and be more successful on your journey to a four year university.
