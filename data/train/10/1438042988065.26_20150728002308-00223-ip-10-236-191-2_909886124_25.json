To commemorate that day, a fountain was erected in the main square outside of Marshall's student center.

It is something we live with the memory of and we deeply support our team every season., 338295=Every year Marshall holds a memorial service for the November 14, 1970 Football team plane crash victims. There is a huge fountain in the middle of the student center area that is dedicated to the 75 football players that died when the plane crashed.

This is a great time for the entire student body to come together and remember the lives and loved ones we all lost., 244152=Of course the plane crash memorial is the highest tradition. Every year on the day of the plane crash from 1970 they have a memorial and turn off our fountain in the middle of campus. This remains off until around the spring game when they turn it back off. The memorial asks all students to be in attendance as well as the community. It is one of the nicest things to see and really has an impact on the town., 337660=Science students will especially love the new Robert Byrd Biotechnology Center. This building is filled with high-tech machines and analysis software for all of your scientific needs. In 2015, the brand new Engineering Center will open and will be a wonderful new addition for all of the aspiring engineers out there. The Arts are very highly held here as well. From music theory to art, you will find your niche here., 427413=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 260133=In the 70's, there was a plane crash where an entire football team, coaches, and others from the university died on the way home from a football game. There now is a fountain behind the Memorial Student Center that was made as a memorial to remember those who died. Every November, on the anniversary of the crash, at the exact same time every year. The fountain is turned off, and there is a memorial ceremony. Then, there is another ceremony to turn it back on in May., 133299=There is a fountain in the center of the campus that is a memorial to the 1970 Marshall Football team. The team members, coaches, and other students were killed in the 1970 plane crash.

All seventy-five people on board were killed, including 37 players and 5 coaches. It is a very moving ceremony and tradition., 410031=Marshall University is incredible traditional. In 1970 a plane of Marshall football players returning from a game at ECU crashed causing all on board to die. In memory there is a fountain in the center of campus. Every winter there is a fountain ceremony with speakers and music honoring each of the deceased passengers. In the spring there is another fountain ceremony in which the fountain is turned back on. The movie We Are Marshall was created after the plane crash. At all football games the We Are Marshall chant is yelled multiple times throughout a game. Watching the film is a regular occurrence for students on campus., 152013=There is a Memorial Fountain dedicated to the lives lost in a plane crash carrying the Marshall University football team in November of 1970. Every year on the anniversary of the crash a ceremony is held to turn off the fountain., 118520=If you have ever seen the movie We Are Marshall, you are familiar with the tragic 1970 plane crash that killed almost all of Marshall's football team and coaches. That is a very important part of Marshall's history. The student center, officially the Memorial Student Center, is dedicated to those football players as well as the uniquely shaped fountain outside. The fountain is turned off every year during a memorial ceremony on the anniversary of the plane crash and not turned back on until the spring. Marshall football is a huge deal in the community and yes we do shout We are Marshall at the games. There is a lot of school spirit where Marshall athletics are concerned., 40009=Every year on the date of the Marshall plane crash, we turn off the fountain that is located in the middle of campus. The fountain is there in many of all the people who died in the 1970 plane crash. In the middle of Huntington, West Virginia, there is a river. Next to this river, there is a steel mill. And next to the steel mill, there is a school. In the middle of this school, there is a fountain. Each year, on the exact same day, at the exact same hour... the water to this fountain is turned off.
