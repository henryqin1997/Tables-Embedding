The Agency is publishing this regulation as an interim rule, which will allow the Agency to begin accepting applications once again.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{321529=One commenter said that the FWS should not collect information to make a non-detriment finding for imports of sport-hunted trophies of Appendix-I species if the trophy is covered by an export quota reported by the range country to the Secretariat and the exporting country has issued its own non-detriment determination. We and several commenters disagree. This was also discussed in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167). Resolution Conf. 2.11 (Rev.), on trade in hunting trophies of species listed in Appendix I, recommends that the Scientific Authority of the importing country make an independent non-detriment finding in accordance with Article III of the Convention. Resolution Conf. 9.21 (Rev. CoP13) regarding interpretation and application of quotas for species included in Appendix I also gives Parties the flexibility to evaluate scientific and management data to determine whether the quota adequately ensures the sustainability of the species. The commenter objected to \u00a7 23.61(f)(4) because we indicate that, where insufficient information is available to make the non-detriment finding, we take a precautionary approach and state that we are unable to find non-detriment. He suggests that, in such situations, we use Resolution Conf. 8.3 (Rev. CoP13), which recognizes the socioeconomic and conservation benefits of trade in wildlife. We note that Resolution Conf. 8.3 (Rev. CoP13) indicates that there are benefits of wildlife trade only \u201cwhen carried out at levels that are not detrimental to the survival of the species in question.\u201d, 86927=We received 344 letters in response to the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167). We received comments from individuals, organizations, and State natural resource agencies. Of the comments we received, 240 letters were from Bengal cat enthusiasts and breeders, 33 were from State natural resource agencies and regional associations, 21 were from falconers and falconer organizations, and 13 were from fur trapper organizations., 111670=The special rule includes reporting requirements for range countries. In our final yacare caiman (Caiman yacare) rule published on May 4, 2000 (65 FR 25867), we noted that the FWS depends primarily on range countries to monitor yacare caiman. To assist us in monitoring the status of yacare caiman, we require that the governments of range countries wishing to export specimens to the United States for commercial purposes provide a report every 2 years that includes the most recent information available on the status of the species. This information assists us in determining the current conservation status of the species and is used to determine if the species is recovering and may warrant delisting. We also have a section describing conditions under which trade restrictions can be applied to the import of yacare caiman from range countries, including the failure to submit the reports or failure to respond to requests for additional information., 81065=This regulation is effective September 24, 2007. Incorporation by reference of CITES's Guidelines for transport and preparation for shipment of live wild animals and plants and the International Air Transport Association Live Animals Regulations listed in this rule is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 24, 2007., 640888=(1) The United States is a party to an international treaty, convention, or agreement that affords protection to the species and was in force on July 1, 1975., 303904=Another commenter argued that it is only the purpose of the import at the time of import that is regulated by CITES and any later use is irrelevant. Nothing in the language of the Convention requiring the finding that the specimen \u201cis not to be used for primarily commercial purposes\u201d indicates that this examination is limited to the immediate use by the importer. As we indicated in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), the commercialization of Appendix-I specimens following import can result in further demand, which is contrary to the intent of allowing trade in Appendix-I specimens only under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d Appendix-II species that are annotated to allow trade only for noncommercial purposes face similar commercial pressures. We can only determine that the use will not be for \u201cprimarily commercial purposes\u201d when we know that the specimen will not be subsequently used for economic gain or benefit., 441000=National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA): The FWS has determined that this final rule is categorically excluded from further NEPA review as provided by 516 DM 2, Appendix 1.9, of the Department of the Interior National Environmental Policy Act Revised Implementing Procedures (FR Volume 69, No. 45, March 8, 2004). No further documentation will be made., 88362=Stricter national measures: Article XIV of the Treaty explicitly recognizes the rights of Parties to adopt stricter national measures to restrict or prohibit trade, taking, possession, or transport of any wildlife or plant species. Resolution Conf. 11.3 (Rev. CoP13) recommends that Parties make use of stricter national measures if they have determined \u201cthat an Appendix-II or -III species is being traded in a manner detrimental to the survival of that species\u201d or is being \u201ctraded in contravention of the laws of any country involved in the transaction.\u201d The United States has adopted stricter national measures, such as the ESA, Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361-1407), and Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3371-3378)., 629872=(1) The specimen was taken in accordance with the provisions of an applicable international treaty, convention, or agreement that was in force on July 1, 1975., 54747=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 1, 2015, 225771=General requirements for standard CITES documents (\u00a7\u00a7 23.35-23.39): The basic requirements for U.S. and foreign CITES documents have not changed since the Treaty took effect in 1975. We have designed U.S. application forms for specific activities and protection levels to make applications easier to complete and to clarify what information is needed. Each of these sections provides information to help an applicant determine which application form to use. The forms can be obtained from our website or requested by phone, mail, or e-mail (see \u00a7 23.7)., 628708=(e) Export of exempt specimens from the United States. To export a specimen exempted under paragraph (d) of this section, you must obtain a CITES document from the U.S. Management Authority that indicates the specimen was taken in accordance with the provisions of another international treaty, convention, or agreement that was in force on July 1, 1975., 85103=CITES was negotiated in 1973 in Washington, DC, at a conference attended by delegations from 80 countries. The United States ratified the Treaty on September 13, 1973, and it entered into force on July 1, 1975, after the required 10 countries had ratified it. Section 8A of the ESA, as amended in 1982, designates the Secretary of the Interior as the U.S. Management Authority and U.S. Scientific Authority for CITES. These authorities have been delegated to the FWS. The U.S. regulations implementing CITES took effect on May 23, 1977 (42 FR 10465, February 22, 1977), after the first CoP was held. The CoP meets every 2 to 3 years to vote on proposed resolutions and decisions that interpret and implement the text of the Treaty and on amendments to the listing of species in the CITES Appendices. Currently 171 countries have ratified, accepted, approved, or acceded to CITES; these countries are known as Parties., 217759=When we review an application, we decide whether the requirements of an exemption document under Article VII of the Treaty can be met or whether we need to process the application under the standard CITES requirements of Articles III, IV, or V (see \u00a7\u00a7 23.35-23.39). If we find that the application is incomplete, we will contact the applicant for additional information. If the applicant does not respond to our request within 45 days, we will abandon the file. We will not re-open the application if the applicant sends the additional information at a later date. The applicant may, however, submit a new application, including any relevant application fees, if he or she still wants to pursue obtaining a permit., 170892=We explain how a person can provide relevant information and request that the United States consider taking a reservation. Additionally, we note that if the United States entered a reservation to the listing of a species in Appendix I, we will require a CITES document that meets Appendix-II permit criteria for international trade in specimens of that species. To date, the United States has not taken a reservation. Entering a reservation would do very little to relieve importers in the United States from the need for foreign export permits because the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 make it a Federal offense to import into the United States any animal taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of foreign conservation laws. If the foreign country has implemented CITES through its domestic legislation and has not taken a reservation with regard to the species, the United States would continue to require CITES documents as a condition of import. A reservation by the United States also would provide exporters in this county with little relief from the need for U.S. export documents. Unless the receiving country had entered the same reservation or was a non-Party, U.S. exporters would continue to be required to obtain CITES-comparable documents because the Parties have agreed to trade with non-Parties and reserving Parties only if they issue permits and certificates that substantially conform with CITES requirements and contain the required information outlined in Resolution Conf. 9.5 (Rev. CoP13)., 199893=We have the authority to question any shipment and its accompanying documents if the surrounding facts indicate a potential violation or create a reasonable suspicion of a violation. Section 10(g) of the ESA places the burden on a permittee to prove that the document was valid and in force at the time of entry into the United States. Foreign countries have the same discretion to inquire about documents we have issued. In addition, violations of CITES consist of more than fraud or falsified documents, and the Treaty requires Parties to penalize trade in, and possession of, specimens traded contrary to the Convention. As decided by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Castlewood Products v. Norton (Apr. 16, 2003), and affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Apr. 30, 2004), the role of all CITES Parties is to ensure that international trade in CITES specimens meets the provisions of the Convention, and the Government has the authority to decline to accept export permits at face value when reason is shown to doubt their validity. We note that the United States receives thousands of CITES shipments annually for which CITES documents are accepted as issued. We focus our verification efforts on those shipments and CITES documents for which the available information indicates a problem may exist., 397232=Regulatory Planning and Review: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined that this is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 because it may raise novel legal or policy issues. Therefore this rule has been reviewed by OMB., 232118=We added a new application form to the table in (b) for export of caviar or meat from wild-caught sturgeon and paddlefish (Form 3-200-76). This form was developed after the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) was published., 332387=In the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), we stated that all net profits generated from activities associated with the import or introduction from the sea of an Appendix-I species must be used for conservation of the species in a range country. Two commenters strongly supported this requirement. Two other commenters voiced strong opposition, citing a belief that there is no legal basis for such a requirement and that it would be more appropriate as part of an enhancement finding under the ESA. The same issue was raised earlier and addressed in our 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167). One of these commenters also stated that requiring a permittee to give up profits is a disincentive to participation in conservation activities, amounts to an illegal tax or fee, and violates the \u201ctakings clause\u201d of the Fifth Amendment., 114597=The possession and domestic trade of legal specimens are not regulated by CITES unless the specimens had been traded internationally under specific conditions of a CITES document and the conditions still apply. The possession and domestic or international trade of illegally imported specimens, however, are prohibited. Further, any possession of offspring of illegal specimens is also considered illegal. A specimen that has been traded contrary to CITES becomes contraband at the time it enters the jurisdiction of the United States. If such a specimen makes its way into the United States, the individual or business holding or having control of the specimen has no custodial or property rights to the specimen and, therefore, no right to possess, transfer, breed, or propagate such specimens. Further, we clarify that intrastate or interstate movement of specimens traded contrary to CITES involves possession of unlawfully traded specimens and is, therefore, prohibited. We note that these prohibitions are not new with this final rule. The regulatory requirements for CITES specimens, including possession, have been in place since 1977, and the statutory prohibition has been in effect since July 1975., 161903=One commenter said that the United States should resist promulgating regulations that are more lenient than those agreed to by the Parties and noted that there is no resolution that provides for this exemption. In the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), we noted that the Parties have not agreed on whether urine, feces, or synthetically derived DNA are regulated by CITES. Where there is a lack of clarity or no agreement, the United States is left to make its own interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty. In our view, these are byproducts and are not recognizable parts or derivatives as defined in Article I of the Treaty. The commenter was also concerned that this exemption could lead to illegal trade in non-synthetic DNA labeled as synthetically derived DNA. We note that this exemption reflects a practice of the FWS that has been in effect since 1994. We have received no information to indicate that this practice has led to an increase in illegal trade in falsely declared DNA, nor do we expect this to occur in the future., 90615=General comments: A number of commenters commended us for revising the U.S. CITES implementing regulations and also provided comments on specific sections of the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167). We have addressed comments specific to a particular section in the appropriate section of this preamble. One State agricultural agency noted that, for the aquaculture industry in that State, our changes will help simplify and clarify the documentation process for dealing with CITES species., 447680=18 U.S.C. 42; 16 U.S.C. 703-712; 16 U.S.C. 668a-d; 19 U.S.C. 1202; 16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; 16 U.S.C. 1361-1384, 1401-1407; 16 U.S.C. 742a-742j-l; 16 U.S.C. 3371-3378., 384378=Two commenters urged us to develop an action plan for the disposal of confiscated live specimens, as is recommended in Resolution Conf. 10.7. As noted in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), due to the complexity of issues involved in placing seized specimens, the FWS makes disposition decisions on a case-by-case basis., 129800=Definition of \u201cintroduction from the sea\u201d: We define this term with the language in Article I(e) of the Treaty. Over the last few years, a number of important events have occurred related to introduction from the sea. At CoP11 and CoP13, the Parties considered proposed resolutions on introduction from the sea and were unable to reach consensus on a definition. At CoP12, the Parties agreed to look at marine issues, including introduction from the sea, in consultation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). In May and June of 2004, FAO convened two Expert Consultations to consider introduction from the sea and other issues related to marine species covered by CITES. At CoP13, the Parties agreed to convene a workshop on introduction from the sea, taking into account the work done through FAO and the relevant documents and discussions from previous CoPs. The workshop was held in November - December 2005. The CITES Secretariat has prepared a document on introduction from the sea, based on discussions at the workshop, for consideration by the Parties at CoP14, to be held in June 2007. We recognize that the Parties may decide on an interpretation of introduction from the sea in the future, but in the meantime the regulations clarify when the prohibition applies, and when and what types of CITES documents are needed for international trade., 846976=Dated: May 17, 2007., 420898=This rule also benefits these businesses by providing updated and more clearly written regulations for the international trade of CITES specimens. We do not expect these benefits to be significant under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The authority to enforce CITES requirements already exists under the ESA and is carried out by regulations contained in 50 CFR part 23. The requirements that must be met to import, export, and re-export CITES species are based on the text of the Convention, which has been in effect in the United States since 1975., 442016=Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use: On May 18, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13211 on regulations that significantly affect energy supply, distribution, and use. Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions. This rule revises the current regulations in 50 CFR part 23 that implement CITES. The regulations provide procedures to assist individuals and businesses that import, export, and re-export CITES wildlife and plants, and their parts, products, and derivatives, to meet international requirements. Although this final rule is considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, it will not significantly affect energy supplies, distribution, and use. Therefore, this action is a not a significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects is required., 180954=Bill of lading or air waybill (\u00a7 23.23(c)(3)): Although a suggestion was made after we first proposed these regulations in 2000 to require that the air waybill or bill of lading information appear on the face of CITES documents, we declined to make this mandatory because the specific information is not always known at the time the CITES document is validated. One commenter on the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) supported this approach, agreeing that such information is not always available., 284136=An applicant should submit the appropriate application form for the proposed activity (see \u00a7\u00a7 23.18-23.20) and show that the use of this type of document is beneficial and appropriate. Upon review of the application, if appropriate, we will create a master file or annual program file for native species that contains all of the relevant information about the proposed activity. We will issue single-use partially completed documents based on the master file or annual program file when we find that the issuance criteria for the proposed activity and the issuance criteria for a partially completed document are met., 360193=The same commenters suggested that re-evaluation periods for range-wide findings should be no less than every 5 years. As discussed in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), subsequent to programmatic approval for a State or Tribe, exports are approved as long as the periodic submission of information by the State or Tribe shows that there is no significant change in status or management of the species that might lead to different treatment of the species., 846019=(4) Marine specimens listed in Appendix II that are protected under another treaty, convention, or international agreement which was in force on July 1, 1975 as provided in \u00a7 23.39(d)., 83628=ESAEndangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), 53440=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 87430=Resolution consolidation and incorporation: Since 1976, the Parties have adopted 256 resolutions or revisions to resolutions. In 1994, the Parties began an effort to consolidate some of these resolutions. Some resolutions were no longer relevant, and others needed to be combined because several resolutions were adopted at different CoPs on the same or similar subjects. As a result of this process, there are currently 78 resolutions in effect. This rule incorporates certain of these consolidated resolutions, as appropriate and relevant to U.S. implementation of the Treaty. We cite the current numbers of resolutions since previous resolutions have been renumbered. This allows the reader to easily access the documents currently in effect on the CITES website (http://www.cites.org)., 136239=One commenter believed that it was unnecessary for us to state in the preamble to the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) that sustainable use can include adaptive management but that, \u201cadaptive management does not...imply that when there are gaps in information the assumption would be that trade would be sustainable.\u201d Our intent is not to minimize the value of adaptive management. However, adaptive management is not the only information considered when determining if trade would be sustainable. When making non-detriment findings, we will consider all relevant biological and trade information (see \u00a7 23.61)., 364808=In the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), we proposed changing the annual report date from May 31 to May 1, to ensure that we receive information in time for us to make required CITES findings before the beginning of the next harvest season. Three commenters suggested that we not change the annual reporting date from May 31 to May 1, because it would require States to revise their existing ginseng laws and would decrease the amount of time ginseng dealers, States, and Tribes have to prepare the requested information. One of the commenters strongly supported our intention to complete the required CITES findings early. However, the commenter noted that the annual reports are one of many references the FWS considers in making the findings. The commenter is correct in that we consider additional information as well as information provided in the annual reports when making our non-detriment findings. However, under CITES we must also make a legal acquisition finding, which is largely based on information contained in the State reports. Based on further review of our requirements, and in consultation with the State program coordinators, we have decided to maintain the current May 31 reporting date., 266788=Two commenters thought that a registration system should be provided for facilities that propagate Appendix-I plants, similar to the registration system for wildlife. This issue was addressed in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167). Although we recognize that there may be some advantages to developing a registration process, we have not incorporated such a process into the regulations due to the complex issues resulting from the decentralized system of regulating nurseries in the United States. Instead, we have reserved \u00a7 23.47(e) for nursery registration, because we will need to work with nurseries, other State and Federal regulators, and the interested public to develop regulations., 152050=One commenter requested that we provide clarification regarding the restrictions imposed by the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 and notify other CITES Parties of this requirement. The commenter also argued that the Lacey Act covered all foreign CITES species. We state in \u00a7 23.15(b) that the personal and household effects exemption does not apply if the country prohibits or restricts the import, export, or re-export of the item. In addition, we state that a personal or household effects shipment must be accompanied by any document required by a country under its stricter national measures. Both ofthese restrictions are imposed upon shipments because of our obligations under the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to provide support for other countries' stricter measures, and actions may be taken based upon information received from those countries about such restrictions., 460935=16 U.S.C. 1361-1407; 16 U.S.C. 1531-1544; 16 U.S.C. 4201-4245; 99, 100 Stat. 3500; unless otherwise noted., 106419=Two commenters voiced their support for this section. Another commenter argued that the exemption for certain threatened species that are also listed in Appendix II is inconsistent with the ESA. As we discussed in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), Congress provided this exemption, and we believe that this section accurately implements it., 418960=The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business as one with annual revenue or employment that meets or is below an established size standard. To assess the effects of the rule on small entities, we focus on industries that may have businesses that import, export, or re-export CITES specimens. Many of these businesses can be placed in the following categories: Zoos and Botanical Gardens with an SBA size standard of $6.0 million in average annual receipts; Merchant wholesalers, nondurable goods, with an SBA size standard of 100 employees; Leather and allied product manufacturers, with an SBA size standard of 500 employees; and Clothing and Clothing Accessories Stores, with an SBA size standard ranging from $6.0 million to $7.5 million in average annual receipts. The U.S. Economic Census does not capture the detail necessary to determine the number of small businesses that are engaged in international commerce in CITES species. However, we expect that the overwhelming majority of the entities involved with this type of commerce would be considered small as defined by the SBA. The declared value for U.S. trade in CITES wildlife (not including plants) was $345 million in 2002, $394 million in 2003, $1.5 billion in 2004 (including one export of a single panda to China with a declared value of $1 billion), and $737 million in 2005., 398703=The overwhelming majority of countries that trade internationally in wildlife and plants are CITES Parties. Because most of these Parties are currently implementing the Convention and the current CITES resolutions and decisions, this rule should cause little or no impact for importers or exporters. The foreign suppliers are, in most cases, already required by their own country's laws to follow the Convention as well as the current CITES resolutions and decisions. In addition, if a U.S. importer were to receive a shipment that did not comply with all of the requirements of the country of export, the import may violate the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981. Exporters need to comply with the requirements of the importing country in addition to U.S. requirements. If a shipment is not in compliance with all applicable laws, it may be seized, detained, or refused clearance at its destination. These revisions include clarifications of the Convention's provisions that have not previously been published. Thus, U.S. businesses are already complying with most of the revisions. Revisions that would impact current business practices are addressed below., 147141=One commenter was concerned with our response in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) to a previous comment that an applicant's failure to provide adequate documentation showing legality of a specimen, while not necessarily evidence that the specimen was traded contrary to CITES, might prevent us from making the required findings or being able to issue the necessary CITES documents for subsequent import, export, or re-export. The commenter suggested that the FWS establish procedures or describe the kinds of evidence we will accept in lieu of positive documentation., 436006=We have made changes to the requirements for trade in sturgeon caviar (which includes paddlefish caviar). The majority of these requirements are already implemented by other CITES Parties that are either exporting caviar to the United States or receiving imports of caviar from the United States. Therefore, our codification of these existing requirements will not impose a new burden on traders. We require the labeling of containers of caviar being imported into or exported or re-exported from the United States. Resolution Conf. 12.7 (Rev. CoP13) recommends guidelines for a universal labeling system to assist Parties in identifying legal caviar in trade. Sturgeon caviar may be traded internationally only if non-reusable labels containing specific information are affixed to primary and secondary containers. In 2005 and 2006, we issued approximately 200 CITES documents annually to export and re-export caviar from the United States., 326908=Two commenters requested that the public be able to comment on Appendix-I and Appendix-II applications. We responded to similar comments in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167)., 396097=Another commenter indicated that our text regarding annotated Appendix-III wildlife (\u00a7 23.92 (b)(1)) and Appendix-II or -III plant species (\u00a7 23.92 (b)(2)) was confusing. Upon review of this section we realized these paragraphs did not accurately reflect our current practice. As a result, we combined (b)(1) and (b)(2) from the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) into one paragraph so that it is clear that for Appendix-III wildlife and Appendix-II or -III plant listings we consider all parts, products, or derivatives to be covered (and thus to require CITES documents) unless they are annotated to indicate otherwise. We also added references in (b)(2) and (b)(3) to the section on artificially propagated plants to underscore the fact that these specimens must qualify as artificially propagated under \u00a7 23.64., 86065=Proposed rule and comments received: We published a proposed rule on April 19, 2006 (71 FR 20167), to revise the regulations that implement CITES. We accepted public comments on the proposed rule for 60 days, until June 19, 2006. In response to several requests from the public, we reopened the public comment period for an additional 30 days on June 28, 2006 (71 FR 36742). The 2006 proposed rule was a reproposal of revisions proposed on May 8, 2000 (65 FR 26664), which were not finalized. We summarized and addressed comments received on the 2000 proposal in the 2006 proposed rule. Please refer to the preamble to the April 19, 2006, proposed rule for a discussion of those comments., 224700=One commenter was concerned that an importer might be unable to show proof of legal import because the documents were retained by CBP and not forwarded to the FWS. The retention of copies by the importer at the time of import is separate from whether CBP transfers paperwork for follow-up investigation or storage by the FWS. Commercial importers must retain copies of documents for their files. Noncommercial importers are encouraged to retain copies of any documents submitted to the government for clearance as an ordinary part of the process whether or not they intend to submit applications in the future. All importers should also be aware that there are recordkeeping obligations under customs laws (19 U.S.C. 1508 and 1509) and customs regulations (19 CFR part 163)., 212791=One commenter stated that the verification process outlined in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) would be grossly unfair to importers. We disagree. These regulations provide a greatly expanded explanation of what CITES documents are required for trade, the information that must be contained on a CITES document, when we consider a document valid, and what importers should present at the port of entry. We believe that this section will assist the regulated public in determining what they must do to comply with CITES if they wish to import or export CITES species., 426219=Some rural communities rely on the added income produced by harvesting and selling certain CITES species that occur in the United States, such as the American alligator, American ginseng, bobcat, river otter, Canada lynx, brown bear, and gray wolf. The majority of consumer products made from these species are processed and manufactured overseas. During 2001-2005, annual exports of animal skins under the CITES export programs ranged from approximately $29 to $61 million. Annual exports of American ginseng during the same timeframe ranged from approximately $41 to $111 million. We have not changed the existing regulations for export from these programs (although, in the future, we may eliminate the need for export tags on skins of certain native furbearers) and, therefore, do not anticipate any change in economic effects or current activities., 436993=CITES Resolution Conf. 12.3 (Rev. CoP13) also requires each live animal in a traveling exhibition (such as a circus) that is pre-Convention or bred in captivity to be covered by a CITES document specific to that specimen. Currently, circuses are allowed to have one document that covers several animals. Under these new regulations, when a document covering multiple specimens qualifying as pre-Convention or bred in captivity specimens expires, the permittee will need to obtain one document for each specimen. As a result, this rule may result in increased permit application processing fees ($100 per application) for a small number of importers and exporters. This requirement will be phased in as current documents expire. We estimate that approximately 40 circuses import and export CITES wildlife to and from the United States on a regular basis. If exhibitors do not obtain individual documents for each specimen, they may encounter difficulties at border crossings. During the comment period on the 2000 proposal, one circus stated that they would not wait for their documents to expire, but would obtain the new documents as soon as possible since the new type of documents should expedite border crossings., 778967=(3) A State or Tribe with an approved CITES export program must submit a CITES furbearer activity report to the U.S. Management Authority by October 31 of each year that provides information as to whether or not the population status or management of the species has changed within the State or tribal lands. This report may reference information provided in previous years if the information has not changed. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a furbearer activity report should include, at a minimum, the following:, 425182=Unfunded Mandates Reform Act: Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501, et seq.):, 773487=(3) A State or Tribe with an approved CITES export program must complete Form 3-200-61 and submit it to the U.S. Management Authority by May 31 of each year to provide information on the previous harvest season., 432205=The majority of the information collection associated with this rule has been approved under OMB control number 1018-0093. Forms approved under 1018-0093 include 3-200-19, 3-200-20, 3-200-23 through 3-200-37, 3-200-39, 3-200-43, 3-200-46 through 3-200-48, 3-200-52, and 3-200-53, 3-200-58, 3-200-61, 3-200-64 through 3-200-66, 3-200-69, 3-200-70, 3-200-73, and 3-200-76., 301155=Two commenters supported the restriction on subsequent use of most imported Appendix-I species and Appendix-II species with an annotation prohibiting commercial trade as an important means of conserving these species. One of these commenters was concerned, however, that there is no mechanism, such as a reporting requirement, by which the FWS will track use of specimens over time. We have decided against adding any type of periodic reporting requirement on subsequent use of imported specimens. The regulations are clear, however, that such specimens may be used only for noncommercial purposes, and any use inconsistent with this standard would be a violation of the regulations. As noted in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), the FWS will investigate any situation for which we receive information that such an imported specimen is being commercialized., 641594=(e) Export of exempt specimens. To export a specimen exempted under paragraph (d) of this section, you must obtain a CITES document from the U.S. Management Authority that indicates the specimen was taken in accordance with the provisions of the other international treaty, convention, or agreement that was in force on July 1, 1975. See requirements in \u00a7 23.36 (e) through (g)., 392079=Another commenter opposed our proposal not to make our final negotiating positions available prior to a CoP. We believe that this comment is adequately addressed in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) and refer the commenter to that document for further clarification., 295677=Two commenters requested clarification and additional details regarding the issuance process and what kind of information an applicant would need to provide to obtain a retrospective document. We refer the commenters to the discussion on this section in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167)., 429850=Takings: Under Executive Order 12630, this rule does not have significant takings implications. A takings implication assessment is not required. This rule is not considered to have takings implications because it does not further restrict the import, export, or re-export of CITES specimens. Rather, the rule updates the regulations for the import, export, and re-export of CITES specimens, which will assist the importing and exporting community in conducting international trade in CITES specimens., 410918=Resolution Conf. 10.20 provides for the issuance of certificates for personally owned live wildlife that would be valid for a period of 3 years and allow for multiple imports, exports, and re-exports of the covered specimens. The final rule advises travelers that they must have a CITES document to travel with their CITES-listed personally owned live wildlife, and it provides procedures for the issuance of these CITES documents. Individuals importing live CITES wildlife for personal use are required under this rule to obtain a CITES document prior to arriving in the United States. Since most Parties require CITES documents for international trade of all live specimens, this requirement will ensure that pet owners are not inadvertently violating the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 by exporting a CITES species without having obtained the required CITES permits. Although we can issue and accept retrospective documents under limited circumstances for activities that have already occurred, the practice is discouraged. On average, we issue about 20 retrospective documents for personal shipments, including live wildlife, annually. These revised regulations will not impose an additional paperwork or financial burden on pet owners or falconers, but may actually save time and money by clearly informing travelers of CITES requirements., 263563=Three commenters opposed our decision not to publish the receipt of an application to register commercial breeding operations for Appendix-I species in the Federal Register, which would allow the public to comment. Another commenter suggested we publish the first application received for a species. As described in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), there is no legal requirement to obtain public comments on CITES applications, we make determinations on whether specimens qualify as bred in captivity for other CITES documents without obtaining public comments, and further review is conducted by the CITES Secretariat and the CITES Parties. Publication in the Federal Register would result in delays in the registration process. Once the Secretariat makes the application available, the Parties have 90 days in which to comment. Thus, even without a public comment period within the United States, registration of an operation may take a minimum of several months. We acknowledge that members of the public will not have an opportunity to comment on the applications. However, we will consult outside experts if necessary, and we believe that the evaluation by the FWS, the Secretariat, and the Parties is sufficient to make a determination as to whether an operation qualifies to be registered., 131252=One commenter suggested that we adopt the definition of \u201cthe marine environment not under the jurisdiction of any State\u201d agreed by the 2005 workshop. This definition, although agreed by the workshop, is still under discussion in CITES and will be considered by the Parties at CoP14. We believe it is likely that changes will be made to the definition at the CoP and that it would be premature for us to adopt a definition before it has been accepted by the Parties., 441420=Government-to-Government Relationship with Tribes: Under the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994, \u201cGovernment-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments\u201d (59 FR 22951) and 512 DM 2, we have evaluated possible effects on Federally recognized Indian Tribes and have determined that there are no effects. Individual tribal members must meet the same regulatory requirements as other individuals who trade internationally in CITES species., 256494=One commenter expressed concern that international trade will be restricted if cell lines are not traded as pre-Convention specimens. The commenter also argued that our suggestion in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) that these specimens may qualify for trade under another CITES exemption document, such as a bred-in-captivity certificate, would be confusing because it differs from the interpretation of other authorities. As discussed previously, the pre-Convention status applies to a specimen that was removed from the wild or born or propagated in a controlled environment before the first date that CITES applied to the specimen. Cell lines that are continually growing and being harvested would therefore not qualify for a pre-Convention certificate. We believe that this is an accurate interpretation of the Treaty requirements and disagree that it will result in a restriction of trade. Based on our experience with this trade, we do not believe that shipping cell lines under another type of CITES document, other than a pre-Convention certificate, will be problematic for foreign CITES authorities or that it will create difficulties for the industry., 847187=[FR Doc. 07-3960; Filed 8-22-07; 8:45 am], 96728=Thirty-five commenters, representing individual State natural resource agencies, State natural resource agency organizations, and trapper organizations, supported not requiring application fees to establish a CITES export program. One commenter opposed our decision not to charge a fee to government agencies seeking approval of a CITES export program. It is our longstanding policy not to charge a fee to Federal, tribal, State, or local governments. Another commenter stated that fees should be raised to reflect the actual value of the wildlife specimen in trade and that no applicant should be exempt from paying an application fee. Thirteen trapper organizations did not agree that small-scale trappers should be charged permit application fees. In addition, one commenter argued that publicly supported, nonprofit conservation organizations should be exempt from any application fees. The FWS fee structure is based on the nature of the activities being permitted, as well as the level of complexity and the time required to process applications and maintain active permit files. For further discussion of our application fees see 70 FR 18311, April 11, 2005., 222054=We received several comments on the process for appeal when an application has been denied. We refer the commenters to the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), where we addressed this issue, and note that the general permit procedures in part 13 of this subchapter provide the process for review if an application is denied. The procedures in part 13 cover all applications processed by the FWS, including applications for activities under CITES., 302098=The same commenter expressed confusion over statements in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) that certain specimens may only be imported when they are not to be used for primarily commercial purposes and that such specimens may be used only for noncommercial purposes. This commenter asked for clarification for what appeared to be two different standards., 223439=One commenter was concerned with our response in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) to a previous comment that an applicant's failure to provide adequate documentation showing legality of a specimen, while not necessarily evidence that the specimen was traded contrary to CITES, might prevent us from making the required findings or being able to issue the necessary CITES documents for subsequent import, export, or re-export. The commenter suggested that the FWS establish procedures or describe the kinds of evidence we will accept in lieu of positive documentation., 54079=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 4, 2015, 438716=We estimate the public burden for all the information collections associated with this rule, including those already approved under OMB control numbers 1018-0093 and 1018-0130, will vary from 6 minutes to 85 hours per response, with the vast majority requiring 1 hour per response. This estimate includes time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and reviewing the forms and reports., 527245=The Office of Management and Budget approved the information collection requirements for application forms and reports contained in this part and assigned OMB Control Numbers 1018-0093 and 1018-0137. We cannot collect or sponsor a collection of information and you are not required to provide information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number., 317240=This section describes how we use both risk assessment and precautionary measures to make a non-detriment finding. There is a continuum of how stringent the documentation requirements may be for us to make a non-detriment finding. The higher-risk, rarer species will generally require a more complete documentation trail to show that they were obtained in a manner that was not detrimental to the survival of the species. Documentation requirements will be strictest for species that have been recently discovered, are not established in cultivation or breeding programs, are difficult to propagate or breed, and, most importantly, could be adversely impacted by trade in wild-collected specimens due to a restricted range or other factors. We use precautionary measures when a review of the available information reveals an absence of essential data as to the intensity of the effect of the proposed trade on the status of the species in the wild. The lack of information may cause the Scientific Authority to be unable to findthat the import or export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species. This process was upheld by the Federal District Court in Prima v. DOI, (E.D. La. Feb. 19, 1998) when we denied a CITES document based on a lack of sufficient information to make a non-detriment finding., 174163=In 1983, the CoP recognized the potential for abuse of the in-transit provision, such as when importers claimed the exemption and delayed shipment of the transiting specimen while they found a buyer in a foreign country. In 1989, the CoP noted that, if valid CITES export documents were required to accompany shipments through intermediary countries, Parties could discover illegal trade by drawing attention to undocumented shipments. The inspection of in-transit shipments was recommended in 1992. Resolution Conf. 9.7 (Rev. CoP13) consolidates the earlier resolutions concerning in-transit shipments., 408332=We have also implemented Resolution Conf. 12.10 (Rev. CoP13) and established application procedures for an operation breeding Appendix-I wildlife species for commercial purposes to become registered for each Appendix-I species. Specimens that originate from registered facilities may be granted export permits or re-export certificates without the issuance of an import permit. This provides some economic relief by allowing specimens from registered facilities to be imported for commercial purposes, trade which is otherwise prohibited by the Treaty for Appendix-I specimens. The registration fee in 50 CFR part 13 is set at $100. To date, the United States has registered four operations breeding Appendix-I species for commercial purposes. During 2005 and 2006, these four facilities combined exported a total of 18 shipments per year. We anticipate that 15-20 operations would seek to be registered initially., 235221=One commenter was concerned that allowing the use of other treaties, conventions, or international agreements to exempt specimens from CITES requirements may reduce their overall protection by allowing trade that may not be permissible under CITES. He stated that the FWS should identify all such agreements in force on July 1, 1975, and provide an analysis comparing and contrasting requirements imposed by these other agreements in relationship to CITES requirements. We disagree. The exemption in Article XIV(4) and (5) for certain Appendix-II marine species is limited in scope and was purposely written into the Treaty to avoid conflicts with pre-existing treaties, conventions, and agreements. Changing or eliminating this exemption would require amending the Treaty, which we do not believe is practicable or warranted., 231448=We address the exemption in Article XIV(4) and (5) for certain Appendix-II marine species protected under another treaty, convention, or international agreement that was in force on July 1, 1975 (the date of entry into force of CITES). Export of a marine specimen exempted under Article XIV requires a CITES certificate indicating that the specimen was taken in accordance with the provisions of the other treaty, convention, or international agreement. One commenter appreciated the clarification in \u00a7 23.36(d) of the requirements for CITES documents for certain marine specimens exempted under Article XIV(4) and (5)., 234116=Introduction from the sea (\u00a7 23.39): Article XIV(4) and (5) of the Treaty provide a limited exemption for certain Appendix-II species when a country is a party to another treaty, convention, or international agreement that protects the listed marine species and was in force on July 1, 1975 (the date of entry into force of CITES). For introductions from the sea, this exemption applies only to specimens that were harvested by a ship registered in the country of introduction that is also a party to the pre-existing treaty. This is in keeping with Article XIV(4) and with the intent of the provisions of Article IV of the Treaty. It also supports the CITES goal of exempting only those introductions from the sea that are certified as being in compliance with a pre-existing treaty by a party to that treaty who is competent to make such a certification. Should a commercially exploited marine species that is exempt under Article XIV be listed in the future, implementation details may need to be addressed at the time of listing., 403731=Unless an Appendix-I wildlife or plant specimen qualifies for an exemption under Article VII of the Treaty, it may be imported only when the intended use is not for primarily commercial purposes. In addition, the Parties agreed that Appendix-I trophies may be \u201cimported as personal items that will not be sold in the country of import\u201d (Resolution Conf. 10.14 (Rev. CoP13) for leopards, Resolution Conf. 10.15 (Rev. CoP12) for markhor, and Resolution Conf. 13.5 for black rhinoceros). We incorporated into 50 CFR part 23 a provision that Appendix-I specimens and certain Appendix-II and -III specimens may not be imported and subsequently used for a commercial purpose. This provision is to prevent commercial use after import when the trade allowed under CITES is only for a noncommercial purpose. The provision applies to Appendix-II specimens that are subject to an annotation that allows noncommercial trade of sport-hunted trophies, such as the African elephant populations of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Under this rule, these types of trophies may be imported for personal use only and may not be sold or otherwise transferred for economic use, gain, or benefit after import into the United States. From 2001 to 2005, the number of African elephant trophies imported into the United States annually ranged from 265 to 352. During the same time period, annual imports of leopard trophies ranged from 413 to 507., 274264=A traveling-exhibition certificate acts like a passport. The exhibitor (i.e., the entity responsible for the specimens in a traveling exhibition) must obtain a separate certificate for each live animal. In the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), we specified that the certificate could only be issued to an exhibitor who owns the specimens. Based on comments received, we have revised our definition and the language in this section to indicate that the entity responsible for the specimens in a traveling exhibition may obtain the certificate. The exhibitor of live plants or dead parts, products, or derivatives may be issued a certificate with an inventory for all the specimens in the exhibition. The exhibitor retains the original certificate, which must be validated at each border crossing. We include a number of conditions to ensure that these certificates are used only for temporary cross-border movement by the exhibitor. A certificate may not be transferred to another exhibitor, and specimens cannot be sold or otherwise transferred when traveling abroad. Specimens can be transported internationally only for temporary display activities, not for breeding, propagating, or other purposes, and the specimens must return to the country in which the exhibition is based before the exhibition certificate expires., 113265=One commenter argued that we should require yacare caiman monitoring data to be submitted annually instead of biennially and should expand the list of the types of monitoring data required. We believe that the final rule to reclassify the yacare caiman (65 FR 25867, May 4, 2000) adequately justifies reporting requirements for range countries of the species., 342584=Two commenters were critical of \u00a7 23.63(c)(3)(iv) because they thought it appeared to be stricter, and thus more difficult to meet, than Resolution Conf. 10.16 (Rev.). They believed our addition of \u201cconsistently\u201d and \u201chas produced first-generation offspring\u201d to the criteria in \u00a7 23.63(c)(3)(iv) went beyond the intent of the resolution. We addressed this in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) and believe that this section as written is consistent with Article VII(4) and (5) of the Treaty and the intent of Resolution Conf. 10.16 (Rev.). We will base our determination of whether a breeding operation has achieved consistent production or second or subsequent generations on the life-history characteristics of the taxon involved. Some species mature quickly, have short gestation periods, and produce many offspring, whereas other species take many years to mature, have long gestation periods, and produce few offspring. Thus, fewer offspring could indicate consistent production in species that take many years to reproduce when compared to species that would be expected to reproduce earlier and more frequently. If an operation has not consistently produced specimens to the second or subsequent generations, we require that it has produced first-generation offspring and is using husbandry methods demonstrated to result in the production of second and subsequent generations. We cannot determine that a breeding operation is able to implement methods for producing second-generation offspring if it has not demonstrated its ability to reproduce the species at all., 397557=a. This rule will not have an annual economic effect of $100 million or negatively affect a part of the economy, productivity, jobs, the environment, or other units of government. An assessment to clarify the costs and benefits associated with this rule follows. The purpose of this rule is to clarify and update the regulations that implement CITES. It is designed to assist individuals and businesses who import and export specimens of CITES species by clearly outlining the requirements that the United States, as well as the other 170 Parties, must follow under the Convention. As of February 1, 2007, our records show there are approximately 9,800 active U.S. CITES documents (the period of validity for documents ranges from 6 months to 3 years). In the United States, the percentage of CITES documents issued for various uses is generally as follows: 34 percent hunting trophies; 19 percent commercial wildlife; 18 percent personal use; 8 percent scientific research; 6 percent commercial plants; 6 percent zoological parks; 5 percent breeding; 3 percent circuses; and 1 percent miscellaneous., 379612=Two commenters were opposed to all trophy hunting and recommended that we prohibit the import of all sport-hunted trophies listed in the CITES Appendices. This issue was addressed in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167). CITES did not intend to ban the trade in sport-hunted trophies, and we do not have the authority to impose a ban on the import of any CITES species without legal or scientific justification., 205967=Ranched specimen: We received one comment related to a provision that appeared in the 2000 proposed rule (65 FR 26664) regarding not allowing international trade in ranched specimens involving non-Parties or Parties with a reservation on a species downlisted from Appendix I to Appendix II subject to ranching. Resolution Conf. 10.18 included language addressing this potential trade restriction. However, Resolution Conf. 11.16, which replaced Resolution Conf. 10.18, does not include this provision. Since the Parties excluded this provision when revising the ranching resolution, we did not include the restriction in this rule., 450670=16 U.S.C. 668a, 704, 712, 742j-l, 1374(g), 1382, 1538(d), 1539, 1540(f), 3374; 4901-4916; 18 U.S.C. 42; 19 U.S.C. 1202; 31 U.S.C. 9701., 536313=(2) The ivory is pre-Convention (see \u00a7 23.45). (The African elephant was first listed in CITES on February 26, 1976.), 439976=At any time, interested members of the public and affected agencies may comment on the information collection requirements contained in this rule. Please send such comments to Hope Grey, Information Collection Clearance Officer, Fish and Wildlife Service, MS 222-ARLSQ, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203 (mail); (703) 358-2269 (fax); or hope_grey@fws.gov (e-mail)., 294066=One commenter asked why we limited the issuance of retrospective permits for Appendix-I specimens to certain shipments for personal use. The Parties have agreed that Appendix-I specimens must be subject to particularly strict regulation and that trade in these specimens should be authorized only in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d As stated in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), we expect commercial traders to know the laws that apply to their business, including CITES requirements, and to carefully inspect their documents for technical errors. Consequently, we limit the issuance of retrospective permits for Appendix-I specimens to certain pre-Convention Appendix-I specimens for personal use that meet the requirements in \u00a7 23.53(d)(7). Another commenter suggested that we add to the rule the language from the preamble stating that we expect commercial importers and exporters to know the law. We decline to adopt this suggestion because we believe that \u00a7 23.53(b)(7) adequately describes that expectation., 627772=(1) The exporting country is a CITES Party and is a party to an international treaty, convention, or agreement that affords protection to the species and was in force on July 1, 1975., 271078=We received two comments on this section. One commenter was philosophically opposed to the use of CITES species by a scientific institution for research, but supported the statement that CITES specimens obtained by scientific institutions cannot be used for commercial purposes. Both commenters supported the requirement that specimens be permanently recorded as being part of an institution's collection but not necessarily formally acquisitioned by the sending institution. However, the commenters expressed concern that the requirement that Appendix-I specimens be centrally and permanently housed means that the specimens must be kept segregated from other specimens in the institution's collection and would preclude the donation of such specimens to other institutions. We interpret this requirement to mean that Appendix-I specimens are to be maintained in a way that they will not be used in a manner incompatible with the principles of CITES. Appendix-I specimens do not need to be separated from the rest of the collection provided that they are incorporated into the institution's record system. They may reside anywhere that is under the control of the registered scientific institution. This may include field stations, offsite storage facilities, or other facilities managed by the institution. As noted in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), a specimen could be donated to another registered institution provided a record of the transaction is maintained., 412306=This rule will provide relief to permit applicants by streamlining procedures to issue permits for trade that would have a negligible impact or no impact on the conservation of the permitted species and that is repetitive in nature (i.e., the same type of specimens or the same actual specimens are exported shipment after shipment). Examples include biomedical companies shipping biological samples derived from cell lines they maintain and production facilities exporting certain native Appendix-II and Appendix-III species. In the past, in an effort to facilitate the timely movement of such specimens, we have issued multiple-use export documents that could be photocopied for use with multiple shipments. However, many countries no longer accept photocopied documents. Thus, we have implemented streamlined procedures adopted at CoP12 and issue partially completed documents under specific circumstances. We do this by establishing a master file for a permittee and then issue multiple documents based on information in the master file. The permittee is authorized to complete specifically identified boxes on the document and is required to sign the document to certify that the information entered is true and correct. For U.S. documents, an applicant must submit the appropriate application form for the proposed activity and show that the use of this type of document is beneficial to both the applicant and to the Service. We can issue multiple partially completed documents when we find that the issuance criteria for the proposed activity and the issuance criteria for a partially completed document are met. In 2005, we issued approximately 3,200 partially completed documents. In 2006, the number increased to around 9,300 documents. Although the creation of a master file has somewhat increased the initial burden for applicants, the subsequent issuance of documents under a master file is streamlined. In addition, this process has brought our procedures into line with most other CITES Parties, which will no longer accept multiple-use export documents., 94749=The following parts of the preamble explain the final rule, discuss the substantive issues of sections for which we received comments, outline significant changes from the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), and provide responses to public comments., 432955=We developed new application forms for single-use permits under a master file or an annual program file and registration of production facilities for export of certain native species. We requested approval of the new information collections, including forms 3-200-74 and 3-200-75, from OMB for a 3-year period. The OMB control number for the new information collections is 1018-0137. The new information collections and the estimated reporting burdens are indicated in the following table., 150495=In Resolution Conf. 13.7, the Parties agreed not to require CITES documents for personal or household effects of dead specimens, parts, products, or derivatives of Appendix-II species unless a Party requires a CITES document. Parties are to notify the Secretariat if they require CITES documents for personal and household effects, and the Secretariat will maintain a list on the CITES website (see \u00a7 23.7). Importing countries would generally assume that an export permit is not required if the exporting country had not notified the Secretariat otherwise. For species covered by the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981, however, the United States requires an export permit if such a permit is required by the other Party involved in the trade, even if the Party had not notified the Secretariat of the requirement. It is the responsibility of the importer to consult with the exporting country to determine whether an export permit is needed in such instances. One commenter believed the United States should impose stricter measures and require CITES documents for all personal and household effects. Such a requirement would be burdensome and provide little conservation value in most cases. Therefore, we declined to make a change based on this suggestion. However, these regulations allow for stricter measures under other U.S. laws (e.g., the ESA) for those species that warrant greater scrutiny. We believe this will allow for greater oversight when there appears to be a conservation value in doing so., 770763=(iv) A requirement that State or tribal personnel will weigh ginseng roots unsold by March 31 of the year after harvest and give a weight receipt to the owner of the roots. Future export certification of this stock must be issued against the weight receipt., 323236=Three commenters stated that we should not treat non-detriment determinations for imports and exports of Appendix-I species in the same manner. We addressed this comment in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) and refer the commenters there for additional clarification. One commenter suggested we add language to the regulations to consider the cumulative effects of past and likely future imports of specimens on the survival of the species. This is generally considered in \u00a7 23.61(e)(3)., 111033=One commenter disagreed with our assertion that international trade in meat of saltwater crocodiles originating in Australia and Appendix-II Nile crocodiles poses no significant conservation risk and could therefore be traded without tags. We note that the crocodilian product most common in international trade is skin and U.S. import data for 2002 - 2005 show no imports of saltwater or Nile crocodile meat. Therefore, we continue to believe that this type of trade does not pose a significant conservation threat. In addition, there is no CITES requirement for tagging of crocodilian meat., 172461=One commenter argued that the United States should prohibit all trade in Appendix-I species involving non-Parties or Parties with a reservation if that trade involves a U.S. citizen or if the specimen is to be imported into, exported from, or otherwise transit a U.S. port. We believe that this comment is adequately addressed in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), and refer the commenter to that document for further clarification., 347902=One commenter noted that the definition and application of the term \u201cartificially propagated\u201d was too restrictive for wild seeds. The commenter suggested that growers of woodsgrown American ginseng should have the option of using locally harvested seeds from wild plants. As described in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), we are applying the criteria of CITES Resolution Conf. 11.11 (Rev. CoP13) to determine whether plants qualify as artificially propagated. If seeds from CITES plant species are exempt from CITES control, as is the case for American ginseng, then plants grown from exempt seed in controlled conditions are considered artificially propagated according to the criteria of Resolution Conf. 11.11 (Rev. CoP13). However, this is a separate issue from whether States allow ginseng seed to be harvested from the wild for such purposes or whether we consider collection of wild seed for the production of artificially propagated ginseng to be undermining the conservation of the species., 220313=One commenter believed that we were inconsistent when we stated in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) that we may consult with outside experts and others before making required findings, yet we also stated that we rely on Parties or non-Parties to make appropriate findings and would seek additional information only when we have a specific reason to do so (\u00a7 23.26(d)). We believe that the commenter misunderstood our point in this section with regard to consultation with outside experts. We may consult with outside experts to assist us in making our required findings. This is separate from the issue of whether or not we will accept the findings made by a foreign CITES authority., 160534=Three commenters generally supported and two commenters generally opposed the exemption for urine, feces, and synthetically derived DNA in \u00a7 23.16. One commenter agreed that urine and feces should be exempt, but wanted to see a statement to ensure that collection methods for urine or feces posed no harm to listed species. Two commenters expressed concern about the exemption because of the potential need to capture and restrain listed species to collect samples. We have exempted urine and feces from CITES requirements and will therefore not require a statement on collection method. However, as noted in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), we believe that it is important that researchers collect samples in a manner that does not harm the wildlife and complies with the laws of the country where the collection occurs. Researchers should contact the foreign Management Authority or other relevant wildlife authorities to obtain information on collection and export requirements prior to collection of urine or feces. Another commenter endorsed the exemption and described non-CITES restrictions placed on U.S. researchers regarding collection of these samples. The commenter added that such research oversight is also prevalent in other countries, often through legislation., 430727=Civil Justice Reform: Under Executive Order 12988, the Office of the Solicitor has determined that this final rule does not unduly burden the judicial system and meets the requirements of sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of the Order. Specifically, this rule has been reviewed to eliminate errors and ensure clarity, has been written to minimize potential disagreements, provides a clear legal standard for affected actions, and specifies in clear language the effect on existing Federal law or regulation., 431341=Paperwork Reduction Act: This final rule contains information collections for which OMB approval is required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). We may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The information collections associated with this rule will be used to evaluate applications for CITES documents and registrations. We will use the information to make decisions on the issuance, suspension, revocation, or denial of CITES documents and registrations., 788898=(2) A State or Tribe with an approved CITES export program must submit an American alligator activity report to the U.S. Management Authority by July 1 of each year to provide information regarding harvests during the previous year. This report may reference information provided in previous years if the information has not changed. An American alligator activity report, at a minimum, should include the following:, 54139=On June 2, 2015, the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) hosted its 3rd Annual Federal Register Liaison Conference in the National Archives\u2019 McGowan Theater.

Article VII and Article XIV of the Treaty recognize exemptions for certain specimens, such as those that qualify as pre-Convention, bred in captivity, or artificially propagated. Generally, these specimens must be accompanied by CITES exemption documents. The regulations remind people who trade in wildlife and plants to check with the Management Authorities of all countries concerned to determine their requirements before importing, introducing from the sea, exporting, or re-exporting CITES specimens., 350910=We also provide the general and specific factors that we consider in making this finding. We consider whether a facility supplies adequate space, appropriate living conditions (temperature, light, etc.), adequate veterinary or horticultural care, sufficient security, and properly trained staff to care for the specimen being imported. We also assess whether a facility has had a reasonable survival rate of specimens of the same or similar species previously in its care. We believe 3 years of data on numbers of animals or plants maintained at the facility, mortalities, and occurrence of significant disease generally provides sufficient information for us to consider. The 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) included language that suggested that we would consider a facility's ability to reproduce or propagate specimens in making a finding under this section. We have deleted those references in paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(3) because the purpose of the finding is to determine if a facility is able to house and care for a specimen, not whether a facility is capable of breeding or propagating it., 474648=(i) Biennial reports. Range countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay) wishing to export specimens of yacare caiman to the United States for commercial purposes must provide a biennial report containing the most recent information available on the status of the species. The first submission of a status report will be required as of December 31, 2001, and every 2 years thereafter on the anniversary of that date. For each range country, all of the following information must be included in the report., 210423=One commenter strongly supported the regulations regarding verification of documents and noted that the issuance of a permit without making the relevant findings is inconsistent with Articles III and IV of the Treaty and therefore constitutes noncompliance. Another commenter recognized that the FWS has the authority to respond to violations, but believed that where a document is apparently valid, and not procured fraudulently, importers should have a reasonable expectation of a procedural standard for \u201clooking behind\u201d the document to determine its validity. We agree and have provided detailed information about when we would question the validity of a permit and seek verification. The commenter further stated that the failure to make adequate findings by ignoring, omitting, or failing to review relevant information is no different. The commenter argued that the regulation confirms the FWS' authority to look behind a facially valid permit. The commenter urged us to retain the proposed language in the final rule because it facilitates proper implementation of the Convention and the holding of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Castlewood Products v. Norton (Apr. 16, 2003)., 302967=One commenter argued that provisions in this section would prevent future donations of specimens for educational purposes. As explained in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167), certain specimens may only be imported when the use is not for primarily commercial purposes. Thus, any subsequent use may be only for noncommercial purposes. Nothing in the section prevents a person from donating or transferring an Appendix-I specimen or a specimen of a species listed in Appendix-II with an annotation prohibiting commercial trade. These specimens can still be donated, consistent with any other requirements of law, as long as there is no economic use, gain, or benefit by either the person or institution receiving the donation or the person making the donation. (See also the discussion in the preamble under \u00a7 23.5 on the definition of \u201ccommercial.\u201d), 214023=One commenter made a general statement that we should modify these regulations to reflect reality and allow uniform application of the rules, in particular with respect to the validation and clearance process. We believe the regulations governing the CITES approval and validation process are appropriate as written. Article VIII of the Treaty requires the Parties to establish an inspection process that takes place at the ports of exit and entry to ensure that wildlife shipments are in compliance with CITES. The validation process is an important component of CITES that enables U.S. inspection authorities to confirm the authenticity of permits and ensure that wildlife shipments were legally shipped from the exporting country. Such determinations are needed to ensure the proper enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations. Specific problems with clearance procedures in a foreign country should be addressed to the appropriate Management Authority. One commenter supported our clarification in the 2006 proposed rule (71 FR 20167) that CITES documents for wildlife in personal accompanying baggage should be submitted as soon as possible to the FWS if Customs or Agriculture officials fail to collect the documents at the time of arrival of the passenger., 409365=We adopted the definition of \u201cbred for noncommercial purposes\u201d in Resolution Conf. 12.10 (Rev. CoP13) for Appendix-I wildlife. Facilities that are breeding for noncommercial purposes must participate in a cooperative conservation program with one or more of the range countries for that species. Qualifying applicants are issued a bred-in-captivity certificate that eliminates the need to obtain an import permit. The number of facilities exporting Appendix-I wildlife is relatively small. In 2006, we issued about 200 CITES documents to export Appendix-I specimens.}",

The majority of these requirements are already implemented by other CITES Parties that are either exporting caviar to the United States or receiving imports of caviar from the United States. Therefore, our codification of these existing requirements will not impose a new burden on traders. We require the labeling of containers of caviar being imported into or exported or re-exported from the United States. Resolution Conf. 12.7 (Rev. CoP13) recommends guidelines for a universal labeling system to assist Parties in identifying legal caviar in trade. Sturgeon caviar may be traded internationally only if non-reusable labels containing specific information are affixed to primary and secondary containers. In 2005 and 2006, we issued approximately 200 CITES documents annually to export and re-export caviar from the United States. CITES Resolution Conf. 12.3 (Rev.
