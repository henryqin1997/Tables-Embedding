Release 3.4.0 The msec keyword was replaced by the down keyword, and the value of the milliseconds argument was increased to 0 through 65535. The up keyword was added, and the value of the milliseconds argument was set at 0 through 65535. Release 3.7.2 This command was introduced. Usage Guidelines When you delay the processing of hardware link down notifications, the higher layer routing protocols are unaware of a link until that link is stable. If the carrier-delay down milliseconds command is configured on a physical link that fails and cannot be recovered, link down detection is increased, and it",
