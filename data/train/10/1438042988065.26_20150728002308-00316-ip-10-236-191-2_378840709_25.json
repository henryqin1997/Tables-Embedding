Genome-wide scan in a large complex pedigree with predominantly male schizophrenics from the island of Kosrae: evidence for linkage to chromosome 2q. Wijsman EM, Rosenthal EA, Hall D, Blundell ML, Sobin C, Heath SC, Williams R, Brownstein MJ, Gogos JA, Karayiorgou M. Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. It is widely accepted that founder populations hold promise for mapping loci for complex traits. However, the outcome of these mapping efforts will most likely depend on the individual demographic characteristics and historical circumstances surrounding the founding of a given genetic isolate. The 'ideal' features of a founder population are currently unknown. The Micronesian islandic population of Kosrae, one of the four islands comprising the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), was founded by a small number of settlers and went through a secondary genetic 'bottleneck' in the mid-19th century. The potential for reduced etiological (genetic and environmental) heterogeneity, as well as the opportunity to ascertain extended and statistically powerful pedigrees makes the Kosraen population attractive for mapping schizophrenia susceptibility genes. Our exhaustive case ascertainment from this islandic population identified 32 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Three of these were siblings in one nuclear family, and 27 were from a single large and complex schizophrenia kindred that includes a total of 251 individuals. One of the most startling findings in our ascertained sample was the great difference in male and female disease rates. A genome-wide scan provided initial suggestive evidence for linkage to markers on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 7, 13, 15, 19, and X. Follow-up multipoint analyses gave additional support for a region on 2q37 that includes a schizophrenia locus previously identified in another small genetic isolate, with a well-established recent genealogical history and a small number of founders, located on the eastern border of Finland. In addition to providing further support for a schizophrenia susceptibility locus at 2q37, our results highlight the analytic challenges associated with extremely large and complex pedigrees, as well as the limitations associated with genetic studies of complex traits in small islandic populations. PMID: 12874606 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE], 14971=I walked into a store back in 2003 and noticed that Yamasa soy sauce appeared to cost more than Kikkoman soy sauce. I recorded prices and volumes, working out the cost per milliliter. I eventually showed that the mean price per milliliter for Yamasa is higher than Kikkoman. I also ran a survey of students and determined that students prefer Kikkoman to Yamasa. Soy Sauce data., 15775=We all walk in an almost invisible sea of data. I walked into a school fair and noticed a jump rope contest. The number of jumps for each jumper until they fouled out was being recorded on the wall. Numbers. With a mode, median, mean, and standard deviation. Then I noticed that faster jumpers attained higher jump counts than slower jumpers. I saw that I could begin to predict jump counts based on the starting rhythm of the jumper. I used my stopwatch to record the time and total jump count. I later find that a linear correlation does exist, and I am able to show by a t-test that the faster jumpers have statistically significantly higher jump counts. I later incorporated this data in the fall 2007 final.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{99955=Fundamentally the program violates the old precept of reducing the number of modalities for a user interface. These are where the user interface shows and hides menus according to a mode setting. Office 2007 turns this on its head and is all about modes. The program opens in the \"Home\" mode, a basic editing mode. The main menus are replaced by a structure called \"the ribbon\" seen in the image below., 161238=In conditional probability a specified event has already occurred that affects the remaining statistical probability calculations. Suppose I want to only look at how the Kitti residents voted, excluding consideration of the Madolehnihmw voters. I might be asking, \"What percentage of Kitti residents (not of the whole vote) voted for Kitti candidates?\" We write this in the following way: P(W, given K) = 2321/2831 = 0.82 = 82%, 159442=What percentage of all votes did Kitti candidates receive? P(W) = 2687/5375 = .4999 = 49.99%, 160353=Find P(K or W), the percentage of the total vote represented by all Kitti residents and all voters who voted for a Kitti candidate. This one is easiest if done by looking at the table. The three cells that have to be added are 2321 + 510 + 366. This total has to then be divided by the total, 5375. (2321 + 510 + 366)/5375 = 0.59 = 59%, 276599=I have a previously known population mean \u03bc running pace of 6'09\" (6.15). In 2001 I've been too busy to run regularly. On my five most recent runs I've averaged a 6'23\" (6.38) pace with a standard deviation 1'00\" At an alpha \u03b1 = 0.05, am I really running differently this year?, 253339=The result is that the expected population mean for Marshall Island High School is between 8.6% and 31.2%. The 95% confidence interval does not include the 7% rate of the Chuuk public high schools. While the college entrance test is not a measure of overall academic capability, there are few common measures that can be used across the two nations. The result does not contradict the staffer's assertion that MIHS outperformed the Chuuk public high schools. This lack of contradiction acts as support for the original statement that MIHS outperformed the public high schools of Chuuk in 2004., 237684=There is always, however, a chance that one will be wrong. In Florida an election was \"called\" in favor of candidate Al Gore in the year 2000 in the United States based on a 99.5% level of confidence. Hours later the news organizations said George Bush had won Florida. A few hours later the news organizations would retract this second estimate and decide that the race was too close too call. The news organizations decided they had been wrong two times in row. Eventually a court case finally settled who had won the state of Florida. Even at a half a percent chance of being wrong one can still be wrong, even two times in a row., 174852=The result is an average age of 24.12 years for a resident of the FSM in 1994 and a standard deviation of 18.10 years. This means at least half the population of the nation is under 24.12 years old! Actually, due to the skew in the distribution, fully 56% of the nation is under 19. Bear in mind that 56% is in school. That means we will need new jobs for that 56% as they mature and enter the workplace. On the order of 57,121 new jobs., 170991=A spreadsheet with the above data is available at: http://www.comfsm.fm/~dleeling/statistics/statistics_fall2001.xls, 140057=A six-sided die. Six sides.

P(Residency of voter is Madolehnihmw M) = P(M) = 2544/5375 = .047 - 47%, 171205=Note that the results are not exactly the same as those attained by analyzing the data directly. Where we can, we will analyze the original data. This is not always possible. The following table was taken from the 1994 FSM census. Here the data has already been tallied into intervals, we do not have access to the original data. Even if we did, it would be 102,724 rows, too many for some of the computers on campus., 160989=Find P(K or E), the percentage of the total vote represented by all Kitti residents and all voters who voted for a Madolehnihmw candidate.

An April 2007 study of abstinence education programs in the United States reported that 51% of the youth, primarily students, surveyed had sexual intercourse. Is the proportion of sexually active students in the college different from that reported in the abstinence education program study at a confidence level of 95%?, 156488=Consider the following table of unofficial results from the summer 2000 senatorial election in Kitti and Madolehnihmw. Candidates from both Kitti and Madolehnihmw ran for office. One Kitti candidate was advised that he was spending too much time in Madolehnihmw, that he would not draw a lot of votes from Madolehnihmw. To what extent, if any, is this true? Can we determine the \"loyalty\" of the voters and make a determination as to whether campaigning outside one's home municipality matters?, 249432=In 2004 fifty students at Marshall Islands High School took the entrance test. Ten students Achieved admission to regular college programs. In Chuuk state 7% of the public high school students gain admission to the regular college programs. If the 95% confidence interval for the Marshall Islands proportion includes 7%, then the Marshallese students are not academically more capable than the Chuukese students, not statistically significantly so. If the 95% confidence interval does not include 7%, then the Marshallese students are statistically significantly stronger in their admissions rate., 40195=For the purposes of this course, the value produced by the spreadsheet function QUARTILE will be used for the first and third quartiles. LibreOffice.org, Gnumeric, Google Docs, and Excel up through version 2007 concur in the values produced for Langford's \"canonical\" set. Excel 2010 separates the QUARTILE function into two functions, QUARTILE.INC for the inclusive quartile and QUARTILE.EXC for the exclusive quartile. Consideration of the different results produced by these functions goes beyond the scope and intent of this basic text. For further information and exploration, refer to Langford 2006 and to Patrick Wessa's on line quartile calculator., 177389=Use the following data to calculate the overall grade point average and standard deviation of the grade point data for the Pohnpeian students at the national campus during the terms Fall 2000 and Spring 2001, 196314=Notation note: In probability notation the above would be written p(x < 60) = 0.1463, 159595=What percentage of all votes did Madolehnihmw candidates receive? P(E) = 2688/5375 = 0.5001 = 50.01%, 162152=Find the \"Madolehnihmw loyalty factor\" P(E, given M): 2178/2544 = 0.86, 159178=What percentage of voters reside in Kitti?

Following the table is a relative frequency histogram, the probability distribution for this data., 193088=Suppose we know that sixty customers arrive at a sakau market on a Friday night at a mean time of \u03bc = 7:00 P.M. with a standard deviation of \u03c3 = 30 minutes (0.5 hours). Suppose also that the time of arrival for the customers is normally distributed (note that areas are rounded)., 32608=In the Fall of 2000 the statistics class gathered data on the number of siblings for each member of the class. One student was an only child and had no siblings. One student had 13 brothers and sisters.

Adding these is possibly the most non-obvious step for an OpenOffice.org or Excel 97/2000 user., 159730=What percentage of the total vote is represented by Kitti residents voting for Kitti candidate? For AND look at the INTERSECTION and use the number in the intersection. P(K and W) = 2321/5375 = 0.43 = 43%, 57145=The last example above is a typical result of a type of survey called a Likert survey developed by Renis Likert in 1932., 99437=Excel 2007 and 2010 are vastly different from earlier versions of Excel. The differences are beyond cosmetic and involve a fundamental shift in the philosophy, the gestalt if you will, of the interface. Excel 2010 made cosmetic improvements to ribbon background colors in an attempt to improve usability., 247190=On Thursday 08 November 2007 a jump rope contest was held at a local elementary school festival. Contestants jumped with their feet together, a double-foot jump. The data seen in the table is the number of jumps for twenty-seven female jumpers. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean number of jumps., 148384=The third way to assign probabilities is from relative frequencies. Each relative frequency represents a probability of that event occurring for that sample space. Body fat percentage data was gathered from 58 females here at the College since summer 2001. The data had the following characteristics:, 160818=P(K or W) = P(K) + P(W) - P(K and W) 2831/5375 + 2687/5375 - 2321/5375 = 0.5267 + 0.4999 - 0.4318 = 0.59 = 59%, 176049=Homework: Use the 2000 Census data to calculate the mean age in the FSM in 2000., 162708=Find the percentage of Madolehnihmw voters who voted \"Kitti\" as a percentage of all Madolehnihmw voters: P(W, given M) = 366/2544 = 0.14 = 14%, 249098=In 2003 a staffer at the Marshall Islands department of education noted in a newspaper article that Marshall's Island public school system was not the weakest in Micronesia. The staffer noted that Marshall's was second weakest, commenting that education metrics in the Marshall's outperform those in Chuuk's public schools.}",
