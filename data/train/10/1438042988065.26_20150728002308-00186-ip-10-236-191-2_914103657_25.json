I keep hearing from current students about May Madness. It must be a ton of fun!, 29632=When I visited Hood college in February, my tour guide showed me three dorm buildings for the students. One was all girls, one was co-ed with girl and boys separated by floors, and the other was co-ed with girls and boys on the same floor. Considering Hood was once an all women's college, this must have been a fairly recent addition. The dorm rooms had a great college feel to it with all the needed necessities and spacious closet room and more than enough space for two others. Along with the rooms, each dorm building has a themed lounge rooms for the students., 28498=Once I enter my Fall 2012 semester at Hood, I will definitely take advantage of the luscious scenery of campus for biking. Also, since Hood is fairly close to Downtown Frederick, I definitely plan to stop by there every weeks or so and soak in the city life., 88905=There are always things going on at the school especially on weekends. The best time of the year is during May Madness right before finals week when the campus turns into a water amusement park.}",

It's a great break between classes, and you get gym credit for it. Its relaxing and the teacher couldn't be more positive and peaceful. Another tip-- don't be shy! Just try being outgoing and see what happens. Am enjoying being here Hood really has something for everyone. My advice is, come check it out and think of how you can make it work for you. We may be small, but our small campus gives the feel of it being a bit bigger. I'm a freshman, and the first few day I was here, I thought everyone was being cheesy just to be welcoming for the new students. Weeks have gone by, and I've discovered that people here really are genuinely nice. I was worried that there would be nothing to do here, but there is tons. Downtown is beautiful, the mountains can be seen from most of",
