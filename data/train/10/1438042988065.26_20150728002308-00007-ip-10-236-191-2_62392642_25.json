People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters. (Ex: college residence halls, skilled-nursing facilities, military barracks, \u2026) Family \u2014 A family includes a householder and one or more people living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. Non-family Household \u2014 A householder living alone or with nonrelatives only. Note: Family households and husband-wife-couple families do not include same-sex married couples even if the marriage was performed in a state issuing marriage certificates for same-sex couples. Same-sex-couple households are included in the family households category if there is at least one additional person related to the householder by birth or adoption. Same-sex-couple households with no relatives of the householder present are tabulated in nonfamily households.
