    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6619=A magnetic device was produced in the same method as the example A except that a relation between the coil terminal and the opening was changed and then, DC resistance Rdc between the external electrodes was measured. Where the dimension of an opening of the upper ferrite magnetic film is c and the dimension of a planar coil terminal portion is d as shown in FIG. 18, (d\u2212c)/2 was changed to 50 to 300 \u03bcm. An opening area A was changed to 50 to 1500 \u03bcm2. Table 14 shows a measurement result of the DC resistance Rdc. From Table 14, it is found that if an opening is inside by 50 \u03bcm or more to 200 \u03bcm or less, more preferably 100 \u03bcm or more to 200 \u03bcm or less of the periphery of the planar coil terminal portion ((d\u2212c)/2) and the contact portion area A is 100 \u03bcm2 or more, the examples 83 to 85 can achieve an excellent contact between the coil terminal and external electrode. In the example 86, because the opening is large, the external electrode is short-circuited to other coil portion than the coil terminal. In the examples 87 and 88, the contact portion area A is small so that Rdc is increased.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{50710=Next, the thickness of the aforementioned lower ferrite magnetic film will be described. Inductance of the magnetic device depends on \u03bcr\ufffdtm and \u03bcr\ufffdtm\u22671000 (\u03bcm) is required where \u03bcr is relative permeability and tm is film thickness. Considering that the permeability of the ferrite magnetic film in the magnetic device is 100-200, the film thickness needs to be 10 \u03bcm or more. On the other hand, if the thickness of the lower ferrite magnetic film exceeds 100 \u03bcm, inductance is increased. However, the film thickness is increased so that defects such as separation of the ferrite magnetic film often occur. Therefore, preferably, the thickness of the lower ferrite magnetic film is 10 \u03bcm or more to 100 \u03bcm or less., 22738=This is a Divisional of U.S. Patent application Ser.
