    "textAfterTable": "4.15.7 Formatting Dates BI Publisher supports three methods for specifying the date format: Specify an explicit date format mask using Microsoft Word's native date format mask. Specify an explicit date format mask using Oracle's format-date function. Specify an abstract date format mask using Oracle's abstract date format masks. (Recommended for multilingual templates.) Only one method should be used. If both the Oracle and MS format masks are specified, the data is formatted twice, which causes unexpected behavior. 4.15.8 Data Source Requirements To use the Microsoft format mask or the Oracle format mask, the date from the XML data source must be in canonical format. This format is: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+HH:MM where YYYY is the year MM is the month DD is the day T is the separator between the date and time component hh is the hour in 24-hour format mm is the minutes ss is the seconds +HH:MM is the time zone offset from Universal Time (UTC), or Greenwich Mean Time An example of this construction is: 2005-01-01T09:30:10-07:00 The data after the \"T\" is optional, therefore the following date: 2005-01-01 can be formatted using either date formatting option.",
