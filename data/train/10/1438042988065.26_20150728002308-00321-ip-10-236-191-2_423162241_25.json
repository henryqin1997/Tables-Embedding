            "A heterodimeric DNA polymerase complex that catalyzes error-prone DNA synthesis in contexts such as translesion synthesis and double-stranded break repair. First characterized in Saccharomyces, in which the subunits are Rev3p and Rev7p; a third protein, Rev1p, is often associated with the polymerase dimer.",

            "A low fidelity DNA-directed DNA polymerase that functions during replication, to promote the extension of forks whose progression is stopped for any reason; a non-processive enzyme with no 3'-5' exonuclease activity; possesses deoxycytidyl transferase activity, incorporating deoxycytidyl opposite abasic sites. Functions during DNA repair and mutagenesis. Composed of two subunits.",
