The original comment period closed on October 27, 2014. NMFS is reopening the comment period for an additional 15 days to provide the public additional time to comment on this proposed rule. If implemented, the proposed rule would establish a comprehensive regulatory program for managing the development of an environmentally sound and economically sustainable aquaculture industry in Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). The purpose of the proposed rule is to increase the yield of Federal fisheries in the Gulf by supplementing the harvest of wild caught species with cultured product., 149492=NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for commercial king mackerel in the western zone of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) through this temporary final rule. NMFS has determined that the commercial quota for king mackerel in the western zone of the Gulf EEZ will have been reached by October 17, 2014. Therefore, NMFS closes the western zone of the Gulf to commercial king mackerel fishing in the EEZ. This closure is necessary to protect the Gulf king mackerel resource., 109433=NMFS implements accountability measures (AMs) for commercial Atlantic migratory group cobia in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. Commercial landings for Atlantic migratory group cobia, as estimated by the Science Research Director (SRD), are projected to reach the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) on December 11, 2014. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial sector for Atlantic migratory group cobia on December 11, 2014, and it will remain closed throughout the remainder of the fishing year, through December 31, 2014. This closure is necessary to protect the resource of Atlantic migratory group cobia., 144397=NMFS implements accountability measures (AMs) for commercial wrasses in the exclusive economic zone of the U.S. Caribbean (EEZ) off Puerto Rico for the 2014 fishing year through this temporary rule. NMFS has determined that the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) for wrasses off Puerto Rico, as estimated by the Science and Research Director (SRD), was exceeded based on average landings during the 2011-2012 fishing years. This temporary rule reduces the length of the 2014 commercial fishing season for wrasses off Puerto Rico by the amount necessary to ensure that landings do not exceed the commercial ACL in 2014. NMFS implements AMs and closes the commercial sector for wrasses off Puerto Rico at 12:01 a.m., local time, on October 20, 2014, through the end of the fishing year, December 31, 2014. These AMs are necessary to protect the Caribbean wrasses resource., 114276=NMFS implements accountability measures (AMs) for recreational gray triggerfish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. Because recreational landings for gray triggerfish in the 2013 fishing year exceeded the recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for the stock, NMFS monitored recreational landings in 2014 for a persistence in increased landings. Through this temporary rule, NMFS now closes the recreational sector for gray triggerfish in the South Atlantic EEZ on November 26, 2014, as NMFS has projected the recreational ACL to have been met for the 2014 fishing year. This closure is necessary to protect the gray triggerfish resource., 80384=NMFS implements an accountability measure for the commercial longline component for golden tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. Commercial longline landings for golden tilefish are projected to reach the longline component's commercial annual catch limit (ACL; commercial quota) on February 19, 2015. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial longline component for golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ on February 19, 2015, and it will remain closed until the start of the next fishing season, January 1, 2016. This closure is necessary to protect the golden tilefish resource., 129808=NMFS implements accountability measures (AMs) for the commercial sector for gag in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. Commercial landings for gag, as estimated by the Science Research Director, are projected to reach the commercial annual catch limit (ACL). Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial sector for gag in the South Atlantic EEZ on November 21, 2014, for the remainder of the 2014 fishing year, through December 31, 2014. This action is necessary to protect the South Atlantic gag resource., 70847=NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) through this temporary rule for commercial harvest of king mackerel in the Florida west coast southern subzone of the eastern zone of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) using run-around gillnet gear. NMFS has determined that the commercial annual catch limit (ACL; commercial quota) for king mackerel using run-around gillnet gear in the Florida west coast southern subzone of the Gulf EEZ will be reached on February 20, 2015. Therefore, NMFS closes the Florida west coast southern subzone to commercial king mackerel fishing using run-around gillnet gear in the Gulf EEZ. This closure is necessary to protect the Gulf king mackerel resource., 13082=NMFS implements management measures described in a framework action to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP) prepared by the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) Fishery Management Council (Council). The final rule increases commercial and recreational quotas for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico reef fish fishery for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 fishing years. Quotas for subsequent fishing years would remain at 2017 levels unless changed by future rulemaking. This rule also announces the closure dates for the red snapper recreational sector components (private angling and for-hire components) in the Gulf. The private angling component will close at 12:01 a.m., local time, June 11, 2015, and the for-hire component will close at 12:01 a.m., local time, on July 15, 2015. This rule is intended to help achieve optimum yield for the Gulf red snapper resource without increasing the risk of red snapper experiencing overfishing., 23804=NMFS implements accountability measures (AMs) for the commercial sector for vermilion snapper in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. NMFS projects that commercial landings for vermilion snapper will reach the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) for the January 1 through June 30, 2015, fishing period on April 15, 2015. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial sector for vermilion snapper in the South Atlantic EEZ on April 15, 2015, and it will remain closed until the start of the July 1 through December 31, 2015, fishing period. This closure is necessary to protect the South Atlantic vermilion snapper resource., 196439=NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in Framework Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic (CMP) Resources in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Region (Framework Amendment 2), as prepared and submitted by the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Councils (Councils). If implemented, this proposed rule would remove the unlimited commercial trip limit for Spanish mackerel in Federal waters off the east coast of Florida on weekdays beginning December 1 of each year. Since the trip limit system has been in place, fishery conditions and regulations have changed. This proposed rule intends to modify the current trip limit system to better fit the current fishery conditions and catch limits for Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel in the southern zone, while increasing social and economic benefits of the CMP fishery., 28660=NMFS implements accountability measures (AMs) for commercial blueline tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. Commercial landings for blueline tilefish, as estimated by the Science and Research Director, have reached the commercial annual catch limit (ACL). Therefore, NMFS is closing the commercial sector for blueline tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ at 12:01 a.m., local time, April 7, 2015, and it will remain closed until the start of the next fishing season, January 1, 2016. This closure is necessary to protect the blueline tilefish resource., 89814=NMFS implements accountability measures (AMs) for recreational gray triggerfish in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) reef fish fishery for the 2015 fishing year through this temporary rule. Landings data indicate the 2014 recreational annual catch limit (ACL) was exceeded; thus, NMFS reduces the 2015 recreational ACL and annual catch target (ACT) for gray triggerfish and closes the recreational sector for gray triggerfish in the Gulf exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This action is necessary to reduce overfishing of the Gulf gray triggerfish resource., 139526=NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for commercial king mackerel in the Florida west coast northern subzone of the eastern zone of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) through this temporary final rule. NMFS has determined that the quota for king mackerel in the Florida west coast northern subzone of the Gulf EEZ will have been reached by October 27, 2014. Therefore, NMFS closes the Florida west coast northern subzone to commercial king mackerel fishing in the EEZ on October 27, 2014, to protect the Gulf king mackerel resource., 166293=\u00a7 1802 - Definitions, 166751=Title 50 published on 2014-10-01, 8454=NMFS implements accountability measures for commercial gray triggerfish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. NMFS projects commercial landings for gray triggerfish, will reach the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) on May 8, 2015. Therefore, NMFS is closing the commercial sector for gray triggerfish in the South Atlantic EEZ on May 8, 2015, and it will remain closed until NMFS announces the start of the next fishing season. This closure is necessary to protect the gray triggerfish resource., 158948=NMFS issues this temporary rule to extend the expiration date of emergency measures implemented to reduce the amount of blueline tilefish that may be harvested in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. NMFS published an emergency rule on April 17, 2014, to remove the blueline tilefish portion from the deep-water complex annual catch limit (ACL) and establish separate commercial and recreational ACLs and accountability measures (AMs) for blueline tilefish. The intent of this rulemaking is to extend the measures implemented in the emergency action to reduce overfishing of blueline tilefish in the South Atlantic while the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) develops permanent management measures., 66274=This document contains a correction to the final rule to implement Amendment 20B to the Fishery Management Plan for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources in the exclusive economic zone of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Region (Amendment 20B) that was published in the Federal Register January 27, 2015., 104498=NMFS implements accountability measures (AMs) for the commercial porgy complex in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. In the South Atlantic, the porgy complex includes jolthead porgy, knobbed porgy, whitebone porgy, scup, and saucereye porgy. Commercial landings for the porgy complex, as estimated by the Science and Research Director (SRD), are projected to reach the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) on December 6, 2014. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial sector for the porgy complex in the South Atlantic EEZ on December 9, 2014, and it will remain closed until the start of the next fishing year, January 1, 2015. This closure is necessary to protect the porgy complex resource., 166193=\u00a7 1801 - Findings, purposes and policy, 215730=NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in a framework action to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP) prepared by the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) Fishery Management Council (Council) (2015 Gulf red snapper framework action). If implemented, this proposed rule would increase the commercial and recreational quotas for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico reef fish fishery for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 fishing years Quotas for subsequent fishing years would remain at 2017 levels unless changed by future rulemaking. This proposed rule is intended to help achieve optimum yield (OY) for the Gulf red snapper resource without increasing the risk of red snapper experiencing overfishing.}",
