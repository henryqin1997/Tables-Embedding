Computers must be discovered before you can use client push installation to install the Configuration Manager client on devices. When discovery of a resource is successful, discovery puts information about the resource in a file that is referred to as a discovery data record (DDR). DDRs are in turn processed by site servers and entered into the Configuration Manager database where they are then replicated by database-replication with all sites. The replication makes discovery data available at each site in the hierarchy, regardless of where it was discovered or processed.

    "textAfterTable": "Discovery Methods in Configuration Manager Before you enable discovery methods for Configuration Manager, ensure you understand what each method can discover. Because discovery can generate a large volume of network traffic, and the resultant DDRs can result in a significant use of CPU resources during processing, plan to use only those discovery methods that you require to meet your goals. You could use only one or two discovery methods to be successful, and you can always enable additional methods in a controlled manner to extend the level of discovery in your environment. Use the following table to help you plan for each of the six configurable discovery methods. Discovery method Enabled by default Accounts that run discovery More information Active Directory Forest Discovery No Active Directory Forest Discovery Account, or the computer account of the site server Can discover Active Directory sites and subnets, and then create Configuration Manager boundaries for each site and subnet from the forests that you have configured for discovery. When Active Directory Forest Discovery identifies a supernet that is assigned to an Active Directory site, Configuration Manager converts the supernet into an IP address range boundary. Supports a user-defined account to discover resources for each forest. Can publish to the Active Directory Domain Services of a forest when publishing to that forest is enabled, and the specified account has permissions to that forest.",
