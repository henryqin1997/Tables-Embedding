It would be less stressful to have $5,000 in the bank for moving/living expenses before you begin. There is no system in place for affordable housing while away. You are on your own.",

There are so many different people here! I have people in my class that are in their 60's and 70's, but a majority are under 40. Teachers are extremely understanding to those with children as well! Tips for prospective students Get your financial aid in early!!! There are a lot of students who apply so it takes the financial aid office a while to process them all. And make sure you talk with a counselor from the program that you're interested in because pre-reqs for courses and transfers can sometimes differ. Bang for the buck It's community college so it's cheaper than a four year! Am enjoying being here The campus is awesome! The cafe makes superb food,",
