    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot This University has an excellent student to teacher ratio. There are many classes that have 30 or less and when it comes down to my specific major, the class sizes are even smaller. This is helpful when needing help or if I have questions on the material. I can call most of my professors at anytime and schedule an appointment if I need to and all the faculty and staff are very friendly.
