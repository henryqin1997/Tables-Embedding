            "Memory device, memory controller and memory system - An image memory, image memory system, and memory controller that are capable of efficiently accessing a rectangular area of two-dimensionally arrayed data are provided. The memory device has: a memory cell array that has a plurality of memory unit areas, each of which is selected by addresses; a plurality of input/output terminals; and an input/output unit provided between the memory cell array and the plurality of input/output terminals. Each of the memory unit areas stores therein data of a plurality of bytes or bits corresponding to the plurality of input/output terminals respectively, and the memory cell array and the input/output unit access a plurality of bytes or bits stored in a first memory unit area corresponding to the input address and in a second memory unit area adjacent to the first memory unit on the basis of the input address and combination information of the bytes or bits in response to a first operation code, and then, from the plurality of bytes or bits within the accessed first and second memory unit areas, associate a combination of the plurality of bytes or bits based on the combination information, with the plurality of input/output terminals.",
            "MEMORY DEVICE, MEMORY CONTROLLER AND MEMORY SYSTEM - Provided is a memory device in which the decrease of the effective bandwidth caused by the refresh operation of the memory device has been solved, a memory controller of the memory device, and a memory system thereof. A memory device that is operated in response to a command from a memory controller has a plurality of banks that respectively have memory cores including memory cell arrays and decoders and are selected by bank addresses; and a control circuit, which, in response to a background refresh command, causes the memory cores within refresh target banks set by the memory controller to successively execute refresh operation a number of times corresponding to refresh burst length that is set by the memory controller, and, in response to a normal operation command, further causes the memory cores within banks other than the refresh target banks and selected by the bank addresses to execute normal memory operation corresponding to the normal operation command, during the refresh operation executed by the memory cores within the refresh target banks.",
