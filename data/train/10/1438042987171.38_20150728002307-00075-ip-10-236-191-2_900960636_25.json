    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34708=Polar Plunge, in Alaska- In January or February, 73773=As of this year the UAS campus has no computer lab available to students. For whatever reason the computer lab was closed this fall which cut the number of available computers on campus roughly in half. The only currently available computers are placed in high traffic areas of the library and in the learning center(used for tutoring and is not a quiet place to work). You can check out an old laptop on a daily basis from the library but only if your willing to pay a $1200 fine (these outdated laptops are worth $300 tops) if something goes wrong with it. Honestly, what kind of school doesn't have a computer lab?? Students are also forced to pay for a membership at the rec center. Much of the equipment is in disrepair and if your looking for a treadmill to use you're likely out of luck. One out of seven treadmills actually work for someone who wants to run on them. Two treadmills have been out of order for around four months. There is a LOT of money being spent around campus to make it look nice (Although I liked it more before they cut down so many trees and got rid of the only grassy area to study) but not much of this money goes to the educational aspects of the school., 113754=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 39715=We have a Zombies vs. Humans competition in October. It's a lot of fun, and there are a bunch of participants.}",

    "textAfterTable": "There is currently one sorority/fraternity available. Alpha Phi Omega is a service fraternity that allows both male and female membership. Since it is a service instead of social fraternity, members participate in multiple acts of community service. Clubs and Activities There are not many clubs currently available, however, anybody has the ability to create a new club. There are not many rules and the school provides you with funding. Great for these types of students UAS is the place for students who love to be outside in the fresh air. There are multiple activities to keep an outdoor adventurist busy. Also, those interested in learning about Tlingit history will be satisfied with the activities available. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus The Egan library holds many informative and historic Tlingit shows available for the students. Included are story telling by Tlingit elders, dancing with the drums, even videos are shown in the Tlingit language. Bang for the buck Though it rains and snows most of the year, UAS is located in a beautiful cruise ship town. Plenty of neat shops, located downtown from the college, await visitors; locals get discounts when the cruise ship season is over. Christmas shopping is",
