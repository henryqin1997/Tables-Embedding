            "They are really big on getting involved around campus",
            "You can go bowling in the Huskie den and you can play pool. There are some parties that go on sometimes. You can also go out to eat and catch a movie.",
            "The food is very good! Just eat right and exercise and you will not gain that freshmen 15",
            "Dorm life is fine. Do not listen that rumor about dorming with your friends. If you feel that it is going to be a problem then feel free to live with a new person. But be prepare to talk about certain things that you will want to happen in the room. If there is not clear communication, then you guys will not get along. Oh yeah the community bathroom with gross you out. If you living with all girls like I do, they bathroom may not every stay clean.",
            "Nothing is perfect but there are some teachers that can really help you make it throught their class. But if you do not use the people around you then you will not better yourself. The staff can only do what they can to help you so help them help you.",
            "If you do not know what you are majoring in, it is okay. You can take the time to look up information about the many different programs that the University have and make a choice then. Do not feel bad about switching your major. Do what you feel is right for you.",
            "It is a place where if you need help, there are many people there who are willing to help you. Take the time to look in to the many options that they have and take that and learn from it. Do not be afraid to ask any questions that you may have. No question is every a dumb question to the students or the staff."

You can eat at any residence hall, but I hear that Stevenson is the place to go. Most of the dining halls are open from 7:00 A.M. to 11:00 P.M, so you can fit your meals in with your schedule with ease., 255014=At NIU, the dorms definitely need some work. I currently live in Douglas Hall, which is one of the smaller residence halls. I enjoy the community of the dorm. Because it is one of the smaller dorms, the people living here are more connected than in the larger ones. However, Northern is in the process of upgrading their dorms. The C wing of Grant Hall was remodeled and made more modern, and the school has a brand new residence hall scheduled to be open for Fall 2012 which is said to be a state-of-the-art facility. With some remodeling and new dorms, NIU can improve on the overall dorm life of its students., 551972=The campus police have gotten excellent reports from top government agencies in their efforts in the town especially since the shooting in 2008. The men and women in uniform here know how to deal with students and also they use a judicial affairs system instead of sending students to the city police. It's better that way the students wouldn't have issues on their record permanently., 413697=Classes and fees are about $1300 per 3 semester hour., 103215=Since the shooting in 2008 (yes. there was a shooting), the safety on campus has gone up a lot. There is a police station right in the middle of campus and there are a ton of emergency towers around campus as well. If you are scared of walking to your dorm at night, then you can call the station and they will drive you to your dorm! Or if your friend if drunk, they can take them too with no questions asked., 6021=Only $830/class. This is very good for a non-community college. The drom prices are what will hurt (nearly $1000/mo.), but appartments are only $275/mo. And with the top Accounting program and one of the best business colleges in the state, it certainly is a hefty discount., 845008=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 346120=Cole Hall (February 14th) Dont step on the circle when you walk into the library (bad luck), 165027=Northern Illinois Unversity is a great place to attend college. I enrolled to Northern in 2009, and I am currently an undergrad sophmore planning on getting my BD in mechanical engineering, then from there will go for master. Northern Illinois is a great college because they have a program called Chance Program. This program is for high school seniors that didn't graduate HS with a good GPA, or that did not do so well on the ACT. Northern started this program because they wanted to give students the chance to attend college, because most college just deny your application if you have a low ACT score or a low GPA. Once again NIU is a great college with good teaching/learning environment, and there are people working at NIU in order to guide you through your college life., 802329=There are a few different Lagoons on campus that most people don't know about. That is my favorite place to go for walks and even sit to do homework on a nice day. The only way to get to know the campus is to explore. At the beginning of the fall semester there is a week of activities all over campus, PARTICIPATE IN EVERYTHING! Students receive a copious amount of free things as well as food and a great opportunity to socialize. There is also a parade that all incoming students participate in where you learn the school fight song and march with your major into the convocation center. Because you are grouped up with people from your major you are immediately making connections with students who are going to be in your classes or have previously taken some of the classes that you will have to take. They will be helpful resources when it comes time for big assignments and studying., 123816=It's a well known fact that there have been problems at Northern before. But these problems have made it safer! Between 11:00 PM and I think 6:00 AM, you need an entrance card and your school ID in order to get into your building. The only suggestion is to not walk anywhere alone at night, especially in the first few weeks.}",

And with the top Accounting program and one of the best business colleges in the state, it certainly is a hefty discount. Am enjoying being here Sometimes it does get a bit boring. However, the people, at least the ones I am with, are great. It is a friendly environment and it is easy to meet people in classes, since many of the smaller classes end up being close. The social scene is fantastic. By the end of the first semester, almost everyone knows each other. This is something that does not happen at such a large university. Am learning a lot Some of the classes are pretty difficult and take a lot of studying, but this is a good thing. I have learned more from my Engineering class than in any other class I taken my entire life. The class sizes vary. I",
