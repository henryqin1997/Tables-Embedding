Large anterior and posterior slots in both cassette and cover ensure that the Micromesh\u2122 biopsy cassettes will sink rapidly (far better than cloth mesh cassettes). A large square compartment measuring 27 mm is perfect even for needle biopsies. The cover does not protrude above the cassette, a great space saving feature allowing more cassettes to be stacked in automatic labeling machines and tissue processors., 173049=\u00a9 2015 Electron Microscopy Sciences, 172219=P.O.

Slotted Cassettes Available in 11 different non-cytotoxic, non-metallic colors. Anterior writing area is at 45\u00b0 angle to make the cassette universal. Made from Acetyl Polymer, which is a special high density polymer that keeps specimens safely submerged in solution. These cassettes are totally resistant to most histological solvents and their slots offer maximum flow through for good fluid exchange and proper drainage. The lids either come attached to the cassette or are packaged separately. The lids can be opened and closed as often as necessary and they always relock securely without danger of specimen loss. Large labeling areas are located on three sides of the cassette for your convenience. Each slot measures: 1x5mm, total 128 slots per cassette. Tissue Processing Embedding Cassettes All histology cassettes are specially made to be used either manually or in any leading cassette labeling instrument.
