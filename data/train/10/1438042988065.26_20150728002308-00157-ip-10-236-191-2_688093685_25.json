When you save it, instead of saving it as a .txt file, save it as a .wps file. Example: Instead of Rockbox.txt, save the file as Rockbox.wps. To make sure non english characters display correctly in your WPS you must save the .wps file with UTF-8 character encoding. This can be done in most editors, for example Notepad in Windows 2000 or XP (but not in 9x/ME) can do this.}",

The x, y, width and height value may be specified as percentages, the actual value will be calculated from the target's display at load time. Percentage parameters can be mixed with normal ones. Percentages can carry upto 1 fractional digit for increased precision. Example: %V(10.5%,10,80%,80,-) The x and y values may be negative which means \"pixels from the far edge\".. i.e x == -50 means 50 pixels from the right edge default shade (2bit lcd's) is black FG on white BG default colour (16 bit lcd's) is the theme colours default font is the user font default width/height is the remaining part of the screen Only the x and y values need to be specified.
