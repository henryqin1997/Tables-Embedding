This action is in response to a request by a group of interested parties to extend this compliance deadline as part of a larger review of the transition provision adopted for the U-NII-3 band. In order to facilitate the new technical requirements, without unduly impairing the availability or cost of U-NII devices or imposing undue burdens on manufacturers or the public the Commission adopted transition provisions which are outlined in the Commission's rules. Doing so will give the Commission adequate time to consider the entire record, including the Joint Petitioners, as part of the reconsideration proceeding. 2015-06-12; vol. 80 # 113 - Friday, June 12, 2015 80 FR 33425 - Authorization of Radiofrequency Equipment GPO FDSys",
