Martin's Laboratory (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.) (Adachi, et al., J. Virol. 59:284-291 (1986)). The Genbank accession number for strain HIV.NL4-3 is M1991. NL4-3.dpol inserts were constructed to encode non-infectious HIV-1 particles and to mimic a live but non-infectious infection. To achieve an insert that would encode non-infectious particles, the entire 5\u2032 and most of the 3\u2032 LTR were deleted from pNL4-3 using HaeII and BanII digestions respectively. The pol gene was rendered non-functional by a 1932 bp internal BalI deletion. Western blot analyses of transfected Cos cells were used to demonstrate the expression of Gag and Env. Gag and Env proteins were present both in cells and in culture medium. This was anticipated because Gag is the only HIV-1 protein required for particle formation.}",

No. 6,841,381 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/009,833, filed on Jan. 27, 1993, which issued as U.S. Pat.

No. 07/855,562 filed on Mar. 23, 1992, now abandoned, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 218942=Tests for cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) activity were carried out by Dr. Joel Haynes, Agracetus, Inc. For CTL analyses, mice were sacrificed and responder splenocytes harvested and resuspended in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin (RPMI-10) containing 10 units of rat interleukin-2 per ml. Stimulator splenocytes were prepared by suspending splenocytes from naive animals in RPMI-10 at a concentration of 1\ufffd107 cells per ml and adding mitomycin C to a final concentration of 25 \u03bcg per ml. Stimulator cells were incubated in the presence of mitomycin C for 25 minutes at 37\ufffd C., washed with RPMI-10, and then pulsed with a synthetic peptide representing a known CTL epitope recognized by BALB/c mice (RIQRGPGRAFVTIGK) (SEQ ID NO. 4). Roughly equal numbers of stimulator and responder cells were cocultured for 5 to 6 days. A cytotoxicity assay was employed to measure the ability of the in vitro stimulated responder cells to lyse chromium51 loaded peptide pulsed BALB/c 3T3 target cells., 202908=HXB-2.env was designed to express complete HXB-2 Env and Rev. The Genbank accession numbers for strain HIV.HXB2 are K03455 and M38432. Rev was included in the construct because expression of the normal HIV-1 Env is Rev dependent. This construct was achieved by substituting the SalI to XhoI fragment of the pSVIII.env construct of Dr. Joseph Sodroski (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Mass.) (Helseth, et al., J. Virol. 64:2416-2420 (1990)) for the BamHI to HindIII fragment of IL-2 in pBC12/CMV/IL-2. Western blot analyses of transfected Cos cells demonstrated the expression of Env., 121585=For gene-gun delivery of DNA to mice, plasmid DNA was affixed to gold particles by adding 10 mg of 0.95 \u03bcm gold powder (Degussa, South Plainfield, N.J.) and an appropriate amount of plasmid DNA to a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube containing 50 \u03bcl of 0.1 M spermidine. Plasmid DNA and gold were coprecipitated by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of 2.5 M CaCl2 during vortex mixing, after which the precipitate was allowed to settle and was washed with absolute ethanol and resuspended in 2.0 ml of ethanol. The gold/DNA suspension was transferred to a capped vial and immersed in a sonicating water bath for 2-5 seconds to resolve clumps. The 163 \u03bcl of the gold/DNA suspension was layered onto 1.8 cm\ufffd1.8 cm Mylar sheets and allowed to settle for several minutes, after which the meniscus was broken and excess ethanol was removed by aspiration. Gold/DNA-coated mylar sheets were dried and stored under vacuum. The total amount of DNA per sheet was a function of the DNA/gold ratio and ranged from 0.2 to 0.0002 \u03bcg per sheet. Animals were anesthetized with 30 \u03bcl of Ketaset/Rompun (10:2). Abdominal target areas were shaved and treated with Nair (Carter-Wallace, New York) for two minutes to remove residual stubble and stratum corneum. Target areas were thoroughly rinsed with water prior to gene delivery. DNA-coated gold particles were delivered into abdominal skin with the Accell instrument, which employs an electric spark discharge as the motive force (Yang, M. S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 9568-9572 (1990)). Each animal received two nonoverlapping deliveries per immunization, at a discharge voltage of 17 kV. The beads deliver DNA into cells, where the DNA dissolves and can be expressed (Yang, M. S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 9568-9572 (1990); Williams, R. S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 2726-2730 (1991)). Expression is transient, with most of the expression being lost within 2-3 days due to the normal sloughing of the epidermis (Williams, R. S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 2726-2730 (1991); unpublished observations)., 225232=316.sgp140 was constructed using oligonucleotides Japcr19 and Hkpcr2 to amplify sequences from PCR env clone 316-3 obtained from Dr. Ronald C. Desrosiers, New England Primate Research Center. The amplified fragments were digested with NheI and BamHI and subcloned into NheI and BamHI digested pJW4303. Western blot analyses of transfected Cos cells revealed sg120 in both the transfected cells and the culture medium. SIV 316 is a mutant form of SIV 239 which has a monocyte/macrophage tropism, (Mori, K. et al., J. Virology 66(4):2067-2075 (1992))., 162992=To increase the efficiency of the induction of immunity, a second experiment was undertaken in ferrets using the Accell gene gun to deliver DNA coated gold beads into the skin of ferrets. The abdominal epidermis was used as the target for gene gun delivered DNA with ferrets receiving two gene gun administrations of DNA at a one month interval. Gene gun inoculations were delivered to Ketamine-anesthetized young adult female ferrets. Skin was prepared by shaving and treating with the depilatory agent NAIR (Carter-Wallace, New York). DNA beads (1 to 3 microns) were prepared for inoculations as previously described (Fynan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:11478-11482 (1993)). A delivery voltage of 15 kV was used for inoculations. Ferrets were inoculated with either 2 \u03bcg or 0.4 \u03bcg of DNA. Ferrets inoculated with 2 \u03bcg of DNA received 10 shots with each shot consisting of 0.8 mg of beads coated with 0.2 \u03bcg of DNA. Ferrets receiving 0.4 \u03bcg of DNA received two of these shots., 181730=In animals with prechallenge antibody, protection was presumably due to the presence of neutralizing antibody as well as the mobilization of memory responses for neutralizing antibody. In protected animals without detectable levels of prechallenge antibody, protection was likely due to the rapid mobilization of memory responses by the infection, with the mobilized responses controlling the infection. Protection in vaccinated animals in the absence of prechallenge antibody has also been observed in prior DNA vaccination studies in mice and chickens (see Tables 3, 5 and 9) (Fynan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:11478-11482 (1993); Robinson et al., Vaccine 11: 957-960 (1993)) and in vaccine trials using retrovirus and pox virus vectors to express the influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein (Hunt et al., J. Virol. 62:3014-3019 (1988); Webster et al., Vaccine 9: 303-308 (1991))., 131113=In the murine trials described above in Examples 4 and 6, sera were collected immediately prior to each DNA inoculation, immediately prior to challenge, and at two times after challenge. Anesthetized mice were bled from the eye vein into 40 \u03bcl nonheparinized microhematocrit tubes. Sera for members within a group were pooled. Hemagglutination inhibition assays were performed with chicken red blood cells and mouse serum that had been pretreated with kaolin to remove background activity (Novak, M. et al., Vaccine 11: 55-60 (1993)). Hemagglutination inhibition titers are the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution giving complete inhibition of hemagglutination. The isotypes of mouse antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using standard protocols and microwell plates coated with purified A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus. These assays used 1:1000 dilutions of isotype-specific peroxidase-conjugated antibodies that had been provided at titers with similar activities (Sigma Immuno-Chemicals). Data for serum analysis are shown below in Table 9. Data are the geometric means of the reciprocal of the final dilutions of pooled sera that scored positive for a given condition., 130075=These tests of gun-delivered DNA in the murine model demonstrated that as little as 0.4 \u03bcg of DNA was sufficient to achieve 95% survival. These survivors developed very limited to no signs of postchallenge influenza. Mice receiving 0.04 \u03bcg of gun-delivered pCMV/H1 DNA had an approximately 65% survival rate and suffered fairly severe signs of influenza. Mice that received 0.004 \u03bcg or 0.0004 \u03bcg of pCMV/H1 DNA succumbed to the challenged. As in tests of saline injections, mice receiving control DNA developed severe signs of influenza and had very limited survival (14%). Thus, highly efficient immunizations were achieved by gene-gun delivery of DNA to the epidermis of mice. This method of immunization required 250-2500 times less DNA than the saline inoculations (0.4-0.004 \u03bcg as opposed to 100-200 \u03bcg of DNA) (See Tables 6 and 7)., 111065=These results indicate that the efficiency of transfection does not necessarily determine the efficiency of vaccination. The high ability of rodent muscle to take up and express DNA (Wolff, J. A. et al., Science 247:1465-1468 (1990); Wolff, J. A. et al., BioTechniques 11: 474-485 (1991); and Acsadi, G. et al., New Biol. 3:71-81 (1991)) did not correlate with an unusual efficiency of intramuscular vaccinations. Intramuscular inoculations worked well, but no better than, intravenous inoculations, and only somewhat better than the administration of DNA nose drops. Similar results were obtained in chicken trials for route of inoculation (described below), where intravenous and intratracheal inoculations achieved levels of protection comparable with those provided by intramuscular inoculations., 223075=239.sgp120 was synthesized using oligonucleotide JApcr19 and oligonucleotide JWpcr8 to amplify sequences from p239spE3\u2032. The amplified fragments were digested with NheI and BamHI and subcloned into NheI and BamHI digested pJW4303. Western blot analyses of transfected Cos cells revealed sg120 in both the transfected cells and the culture medium. 239 sequences were used in this construct because SIV 239 represents an established model for vaccine trials in macaques. SIV 239 is a mutant form of SIV 251, which is also used to generate constructs (see below). The Genbank accession numbers for strain SIV239 are M33262, M61062, and M61093. The Genbank accession numbers for strain SIV251 are M19499 and X06393., 48564=Different structural forms of Env are expressed by the DNAs used in vaccines. These forms can include a soluble form of gp120, such as sgp120. This form is particularly effective at raising antibody to V3 loop determinants (Earl et al., 1994, J. Virol. in press). A second form which can be expressed is a soluble form of gp140, such as sgp140. This form represents an oligomer of the extracellular components of Env; it raises antibody against gp41 as well as antibody against gp120, and also raises antibodies that recognize oligomeric forms of Env that are present in the assembled envelope spikes found on virions (Earl et al., J. Virol., in press; Moore, et al., J. Virol. 68:469-484 (1994)). The sgp120 and sgp140 are released from cells, facilitating their entry into major histocompatibility class II-dependent pathways of antigen presentation and the raising of T-cell dependent B-cell responses. A native form of Env (gp160) can also be expressed. This membrane-anchored form of Env represents the form of Env found on the surfaces of virions and infected cells.}",
