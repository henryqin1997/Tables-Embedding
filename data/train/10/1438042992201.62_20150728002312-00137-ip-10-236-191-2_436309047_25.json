Zhang, South Windsor, CT US 12-25-2014 METHOD OF AIR PREHEATING FOR COMBUSTION POWER PLANT AND SYSTEMS COMPRISING THE SAME - Disclosed herein is a heat exchanger for transferring heat between a first gas flow and a second gas flow, the heat exchanger comprising at least two sectors; a first sector that is operative to receive a combustion air stream; and a second sector that is opposed to the first sector and that is operative to receive either a reducer gas stream or an oxidizer gas stream, and a pressurized layer disposed between the first sector and the second sector; where the pressurized layer is at a higher pressure than combustion air stream, the reducer gas stream and the oxidizer gas stream. 20140374053 07-18-2013 SUPERCRITICAL HEAT RECOVERY STEAM GENERATOR REHEATER AND SUPERCRITICAL EVAPORATOR ARRANGEMENT - A supercritical heat recovery steam generator includes a duct defining an interior area and having a gas inlet and a gas outlet. The duct is configured to convey gas from the gas inlet to the gas outlet. A portion of the duct between the gas inlet and the gas outlet defines an exhaust gas flow segment of the interior area. A supercritical evaporator is disposed in the interior area and a reheater is disposed in the interior area. The reheater and the supercritical evaporator are disposed in the exhaust gas flow segment, adjacent to each other with respect to the flow of the exhaust gas. 20130180228",
