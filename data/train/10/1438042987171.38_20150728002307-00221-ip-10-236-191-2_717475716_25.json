The 1/4 mile track in Mason, MI sprang to life, as the Andrews Chevrolet Super Late Models, MI Army National Guard MI Modifieds, Performance Automotive Northwest Street Stocks, and the Q106 Pony Stocks took their turn on the asphalt oval. The Michigan Education Trust sponsored the evening\u2019s racing program and it proved to be an exciting one. Twenty Andrews Chevrolet Super Late Models made up the field for their 40-lap feature. Defending track champion, Harry Foote Jr., set fast time and started inside the fourth row. John Ledwidge led lap one, while John McNett set his sights on him. On lap two, McNett took over the top spot and never looked back. Bob Bauer, Jimmy Gallagher, and Stan Perry rounded out the top five. Caution on lap 13 shuffled the top 10. Dave Stehouwer broke into the top five on lap 20 and tried both high and low for a way around Gallagher. McNett began to pull away from the field, leaving Ledwidge and Bauer to battle for second. McNett had to work his way through lapped traffic on lap 35 with Ledwidge, Bauer, Gallagher, and Stehouwer in hot pursuit. Caution on lap 39 set up the top five for a one-lap shootout. At the line it was McNett, Ledwidge, Bauer, Stehouwer, and Chris Place. Evan Barrett and Bill Heeney Jr. took heat wins. Nineteen MI Army National Guard MI Modifieds lined up for their feature with fast qualifier, Brian Heeney, sitting outside on row four. Jason Parish lead them down to the start and set sail for a commanding victory. Defending track champion, Bud Perry, started seventh and had moved up to third with ten laps in. Chris Ozanich (Oz) was all that stood in Perry\u2019s way to capture second, followed closely by Bob Curry, and Dick LaPratt. Earl Miles and Justin Kazmar sat just outside the top five and always posed a threat. Lap 20 saw Parish put a bit of daylight between himself and Oz, while Perry continued to work on Oz for second. Lapped traffic played into Perry\u2019s hand as he dove under Oz and took the second spot on lap 22. Perry tried to catch Parish, who had built a half a straight lead. He managed to close the gap, but Parish went on to win. Ozanich, Curry, and LaPratt rounded out the top five. Heat winners were Rolly Olney, Ken Buchner, and Ozanich. The Performance Automotive Northwest Street Stocks started 17 cars for their 25-lap feature with fast qualifier, Dane Long, starting inside row six. Brian Beckner took the lap one lead with the rest of the field still side by side. Corey Davis took over the top spot on lap seven from his third starting position, followed by Bechner, Howard McDonough, Dave Thorburn, and Bubber Patrick. Davis led from that point on, while Thorburn and B. Patrick tried to find a way around McDonough. Mark Smith made his move bringing Long along with him on lap 20. The Patrick\u2019s followed suit and moved into the top five. At the checkered flag, it was Davis, Smith, Long, R.Patrick, and B. Patrick. Dave Bollis and B. Patrick scored heat wins. Fifteen Q106 Pony Stocks took the green flag in their wild and wooly 20-lap feature. A near-shotgun start had cars four-wide at the stripe, with five-wide racing action into turn one. Trei Deubel started 14th and was running in fourth by lap five. He went to the point on lap 10 with a great battle shaping up between John Ward Sr. and Jimmy Scavarda. A side by side challenge on lap 15 brought Scavarda up to second. At the line, it was Deubel, Scavarda, Ward Sr., Wires, and Putt-Putt Putnam. Jason Brun and Duebel scored heat wins.}",
