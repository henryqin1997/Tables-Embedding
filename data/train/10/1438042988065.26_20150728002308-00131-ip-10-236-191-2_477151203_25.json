Finally, an estimate of secondary structure was determined using the program PROSEC v.2.1 (copyrighted in 1987 by AVIV Associates)., 195701=6.76 mL of concentrated H3PO4 (14.8 M) solution was transferred to a 2000-mL beaker, to which DI water was added up to 1900-mL mark. The solution was titrated with a NaOH solution to pH 3 and transferred to a 2000-mL graduated cylinder. Additional water was added to make up 2000 mL. The content was transferred back to the beaker and mixed thoroughly., 22852=It is well established that many sugars stabilize biomolecules in solution and afford protection to isolated cells and biomolecules. These compounds are well established as cryoprotectants and osmoregulators in various species (see Yancey J. Exper. Biol. 208: 2819-30 (2005)). In the development of lyophilized pharmaceutical proteins, sugars (saccharides and polyols) are often added to the formulation in order to improve the stability of the protein and prolong the shelf life. There are two main theories on the mechanism of the stabilizing action of sugars: 1) the sugar excipients serve to dilute the proteins in the solid state, thereby decreasing protein-protein interactions and preventing molecular degradation, such as aggregation, and 2) the sugar excipients provide a glassy matrix wherein protein mobility and hence reactivity are minimized. In both of these mechanisms, it is critical that the sugar remains in the amorphous, protein-contacting phase. Various environmental factors, such as increased temperature and moisture, can induce sugar crystallization. Thus, it is important to optimize the conditions and materials used to suit the particular biomolecule and system under consideration., 21395=Bone morphogenetic proteins and the closely related growth and differentiation factors (in both monomeric and dimeric forms) belong to the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily of proteins. This class of proteins includes members of the family of bone morphogenetic proteins that were initially identified by their ability to induce ectopic endochondral bone formation (see Cheng et al. \u201cOsteogenic activity of the fourteen types of human bone morphogenic proteins\u201d J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 85A: 1544-52 (2003)). There are alternate names for several of these proteins, (see Lories et al., Cytokine Growth Factor Rev 16:287-98 (2005)). All members of this family share common structural features, including a carboxy terminal active domain, and are approximately 97-106 amino acids in mature length. All members share a highly conserved pattern of cysteine residues that create 3 intramolecular disulfide bonds and one intermolecular disulfide bond. The active form can be either a disulfide-bonded homodimer of a single family member or a heterodimer of two different members. (see Massague Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 6:957 (1990); Sampath, et al. J. Biol. Chem. 265:13198 (1990); Ozkaynak et al. EMBO J. 9:2085-93 (1990); Wharton, et al. PNAS 88:9214-18 (1991); Celeste et al. PNAS 87:9843-47 (1990); Lyons et al. PNAS 86:4554-58 (1989), U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,691, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,683)., 201545=A 2000-ml size beaker was charged with 1.81 g lactic acid (MW 90.08) and 1900 ml of DI water; the resulted solution was titrated with a NaOH solution to pH 3. Additional water was added to make 2000 mL and the solution was mixed thoroughly., 197091=0.676 mL of concentrated H3PO4 (14.8 M) was transferred to a 2000-mL beaker followed by addition of DI water to 1900-mL mark. The solution was titrated with a NaOH solution to pH 3 and transferred to a 2000-mL graduated cylinder. Additional water was added to make up 2000 mL. The content was transferred back to the beaker and mixed thoroughly., 202126=0.2 mL TFA solution was transferred to a 2000-mL beaker containing 1900 ml of DI water. Final volume of the solution was adjusted to 2000 mL by adding additional water and the solution was mixed thoroughly., 195230=13.5 mL of concentrated H3PO4 (14.8 M) solution was transferred to a 2000-mL beaker, to which DI water was added up to 1900-mL mark. The solution was titrated with a NaOH solution to pH 3 and transferred to a 2000-mL graduated cylinder. Additional water was added to make up 2000 mL. The content was transferred back to the beaker and mixed thoroughly., 200552=A 2000-mL beaker was charged with 0.75 g of glycine (MW 75.05 g) and 1900 ml of DI water; the solution was titrated with a HCl solution to pH 3 while it was stirring. Additional water was added to make up 2000 mL and mixed thoroughly., 200877=A 2000-mL beaker was charged with 2.11 g of citric acid monohydrate (MW210.14) and 1900 ml of DI water; the solution was titrated with a NaOH solution to pH 3. Additional water was added to make up 2000 mL and the solution was mixed., 25656=Various researchers have reported on using various excipients to protect various biomolecules, for example Gloger, et al. (Intl. J. Pharm. 260: 59-68 (2003)) described the lyoprotection of aviscumine using low molecular weight dextrans to stabilize the protein, and showed that the buffer system and polysorbate 80 alone are suitable to protect the protein during freezing, but dextran is needed to protect the protein during drying; Goodnough, et al. (Appl. Env. Biol. 58(10: 3426-28 (1992)) investigated the stabilization of Botulinum toxin type A during lyophilization using serum albumin as stabilizer and various other excipients, and reported that none of the excipients had any beneficial effect, but by eliminating NaCl from the lyophilization mixture and by controlling the pH, the recovery of active toxin was dramatically improved; Costantino, et al. (J. Pharm. Sci. 87(11): 1412-20 (1998)) described the effects of various saccharides on the stability and structure of lyophilized recombinant human growth hormone, and showed that all of the excipients tested significantly improved the stability of the protein; Ramos et al. (Appl. Envir. Microbiol. 63(10): 4020-25 (1997)) showed that 2-O-\u03b2-mannosylglycerate is effective in protecting several dehydrogenase enzymes isolated from various sources from thermal stress, and that the protection afforded by 2-O-\u03b2-mannosylglycerate was similar to or superior to trehalose for all of the enzymes studied, but was not effective in protecting glutamate dehydrogenase isolated from P. furiosis; Brus, et al. (J. Control. Rel. 95:119-31 (2004)) investigated the stabilization of oligonucleotide-polyethylenimine (PEI) complexes by freeze-drying, and reported that these complexes did not benefit from the addition of sugars such as sucrose or trehalose, but that plasmid-PEI complexes did benefit from the addition of such sugars. These investigators report varying degrees of success, as measured by various methods on various biomolecules. None of these investigators have reported on the protection of BMP's., 196172=3.39 mL of concentrated H3PO4 (14.8 M) solution was transferred to a 2000-mL beaker followed by addition of DI water to 1900-mL mark. The solution was titrated with a NaOH solution to pH 3 and transferred to a 2000-mL graduated cylinder. Additional water was added to make up 2000 mL. The content was transferred back to the beaker and mixed thoroughly., 214250=3\ufffd0.75 g glycine (MW 75.07 g) was weighed into 3\ufffd2000-mL beakers and approximately 1900 mL of DI water was added to each beaker. The solutions were titrated with a HCl solution to pH 3. Additional water was added to the final volume of 2000 mL for each beaker and mixed thoroughly., 201203=0.676 mL phosphoric acid solution (14.8M) was transferred to a 2000-mL beaker containing 1900 mL of DI water; the solution was titrated with a NaOH solution to pH 3. Additional water was added to make up 2000 mL and the solution was mixed thoroughly., 196622=1.35 mL of concentrated H3PO4 (14.8 M) solution was transferred to a 2000-mL beaker to which Di water was added up to 1900-mL mark. The solution was titrated with a NaOH solution to pH 3 and transferred to a 2000-mL graduated cylinder. Additional water was added to make up 2000 mL. The content was transferred back to the beaker and mixed thoroughly., 18991=This application claims priority from a provisional filing, U.S. App. Pat. No. 60/870,032 entitled \u201cPROTEIN STABILIZATION FORMULATIONS,\u201d which was filed on, Dec. 14, 2006., 201868=1 mL of 2N HCl solution was transferred to a 2000-mL beaker containing 1900 ml of DI water. Final volume of the solution was adjusted to 2000 mL mark by adding more DI water.}",
