As the result, blue luminescence of 4700 cd/m2 of luminance, maximum luminance of 11100 cd/m2, and luminescence efficiency 1.30 lm/W were observed., 936216=6V was applied to the thus obtained device by using an ITO electrode (anode 2) as a positive electrode and an Al\u2014Li electrode (cathode 4) as a negative electrode. As the result, blue luminescence of 5900 cd/m2 of luminance, maximum luminance of 12600 cd/m2, and luminescence efficiency 1.39 lm/W were observed., 930914=6V was applied to the thus obtained device by using an ITO electrode (anode 2) as a positive electrode and an Al\u2014Li electrode (cathode 4) as a negative electrode. As the result, blue luminescence of 5100 cd/m2 of luminance, maximum luminance of 12300 cd/m2, and luminescence efficiency 1.38 lm/W were observed., 44686=Moreover, luminescence ranging from ultraviolet to infrared rays can be obtained by changing the kind of fluorescent organic compound, and, recently, studies on various compounds are actively conducted. For example, such studies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,151,629, 5,409,783, 5,382,477, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2-247278, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 3-255190, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 5-202356, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-202878, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-227576, etc., 46813=For example, although diamine compounds as a luminescent material were disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-52868, blue luminescence of high color purity (chromaticity coordinate: x, y=0.14-0.15, 0.09-0.10) was not obtained. An example using a compound having the similar diamino structure was also disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-196177, but the compound was used as a hole injection layer, and there was no description of the use as a light-emitting layer and light-emitting properties thereof such as luminescence color and efficiency., 922940=6V was applied to the thus obtained device by using an ITO electrode (anode 2) as a positive electrode and an Al\u2014Li electrode (cathode 4) as a negative electrode. As the result, blue luminescence of 6000 cd/m2 of luminance, maximum luminance of 12200 cd/m2, and luminescence efficiency 1.45 lm/W was observed., 44046=In a research by Eastman Kodak Company in 1987 (Appl. Phys. Lett. 51, 913 (1987)), luminescence on the order of 1000 cd/m2 upon application of voltage on the order of 10 V was reported in relation to a device having a function separate type two-layer structure using ITO for the anode, and magnesium silver alloy for the cathode, respectively, and using aluminum quinolinol complex as an electron-transporting material as well as a light-emitting material and triphenylamine derivative as a hole-transporting material. Relevant patents include U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,539,507, 4,720,432, 4,885,211, etc., 905213=This solution was dropped on the above ITO electrode (anode 2), and spin coating was performed first by rotation at 500 RPM for 10 seconds followed by rotation at 1000 RPM for 1 minute to form a film. It was subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at 80\ufffd C. for 10 minutes, and the solvent in the thin film was removed completely. The thickness of the formed TPD film (hole-transporting layer 5) was 50 nm.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As described by way of embodiments and examples, the organic light-emitting device using the monoaminofluorene compound represented by the general formula [1] or [2] of the present invention, used in a single layer or in a mixed layer of dopant/host, enables high luminance luminescence when applied with a low voltage and is also excellent in color purity and durability. Furthermore, the device can be formed using vacuum evaporation, the casting method or the like, and a device having a large area can be readily produced at a relatively low cost. The luminescence spectrum of the device formed in Comparative Example 2 was observed by MCPD-7000 and the CIE chromaticity coordinate measured was (x,y)=(0.16, 0.30). COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3 10V was applied to the thus obtained device along with an ITO electrode (anode 2) as a positive electrode and an Al\u2014Li electrode (cathode 4) as a negative electrode. As the result, greenish blue white luminescence of 125 cd/m2 of luminance, maximum luminance of 4500 cd/m2, and luminescence efficiency 0.30 lm/W were observed. A device was formed in the same way as in Example 4 except that the above styryl compound and example compound No. [4]-1 were co-deposited (5:100 in weight ratio) to form 20 nm-thick light-emitting layer 3. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 10V was applied to the thus obtained device by using an ITO electrode (anode 2) as a positive",
