If you got more things to comment about Likexo or how can we improve some things, are you free to contact us. :-) In this week (with other features) we improved the \"about us\" of our site, and we like to show you the new info about us. We are a really early Start Up, and we know that we have a lot of work to do to improve our site, but we are really passionate about our job! :-) Reading your post was very hard, but as any member of the Likexo team, I really appreciate all the feedback that help us to grow (at least) any little step. I\u2019m Cristian Ventura, from Likexo (yes, i am a real person! ;-)) and i have read your blog post about Credibility (that one in that you kill us ;-)), and I wanna thank you about that. \"Hello Jeremy, I received heartfelt email from Cristian Venture, CEO at Likexo.com\u2026 The earlier state of the Likexo product resulted in an",

Even better \u2014 let people, logged-in and not, be able to directly contact team members.) Awesome! This outstanding improvement is a great demonstration of just how easy, with passionate and eager people behind a real product, it is for products to create that sound foundation of Credibility upon which to build a company and a brand. I am, for one, looking forward to many new and exciting developments coming out of Likexo as they evolve and grow.
