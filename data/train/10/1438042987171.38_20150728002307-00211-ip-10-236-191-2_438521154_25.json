            "MANAGING WIRELESS CONNECTIONS BASED ON MOTION - Methods, systems, and apparatuses are described for avoiding short-lived wireless connections. In one method, a first connection with a first access point may be used for data transmissions. A motion state of a mobile device may be determined based on sensor data from at least one sensor within the mobile device. A second access point may be identified. A determination may be made to use the second access point for data transmissions based at least in part on the motion state of the mobile device.",
            "METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR WiFi QUALITY ESTIMATION BASED ON BASIC SERVICE SET LOAD AND WIDE AREA NETWORK METRICS - Methods, systems, and devices are described for determining a quality estimation of a wireless network that may be used to determine whether a particular wireless network meets one or more criteria for association with a station. The quality estimation may be based on a load quality of a basic service set (BSS) of an available wireless network and/or one or more wide area network (WAN) metrics associated with the wireless network. A station may evaluate such load quality and WAN metrics prior to association, and/or after association with a wireless network."

Firstly, an image is transferred into an image layer. Noise of the image layer is removed by a bilateral filter and crisp edges are retained at the same time. Moreover, the image layer is interpolated by an interpolation filter for resolution enhancement. The image processing method of the present invention can lower the image blur degree substantially, enhance the image resolution and be widely implemented in all sorts of image/video processing hardware devices. 20110188749 Published Description Patent application number Richard Hua, Mountain View, CA US 07-23-2015 USER INTERFACE MODIFICATION AND USAGE TRACKING - A method is provided to modify a view used by an application to generate a user interface element on a display screen of an electronic device; a view selector information structure identifies a hierarchy of selector visual property constraints and associated selector structural property constraints; modification information indicates one or more modifications to one or more views selected using the view selector; in the course of running the application on the electronic device, a determination is made as to whether an application subview hierarchy matches the selector information structure; in response to determining a match, a modification indicated by the modification information is imparted to",
