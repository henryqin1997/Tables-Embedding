A shorter version of the peptides, starting at P2\u2032 (sequence:Xx3-Xx4-Phe-Arg-Met-Gly-Gly-(Resin bead) (SEQ ID NO: 22)), was also present in each bead with a ratio to the longer sequence at about 7:3. Without isostere, the short sequence would not bind memapsin 2 with significant strength but its presence was convenient for identifying the residues at P2\u2032 and P3\u2032 by automated Edman degradation. The residues were identified from the randomized positions as follows:}",

Tg2576 mice, expressing the Swedish mutation of the human amyloid precursor protein (including SEQ ID NO: 11) (Hsiao, K., et al., Science 274:99-102 (1996), the teachings of which are incorporated hereby in their entirety) were injected with CPI-3, which is identical in amino acid sequence to CPI-2 and lacks the amino-terminal fluorescein (FAM) derivative. Blood was collected from tg2576 animals at time intervals following injection of 400 \u03bcg of CPI-3., 862341=[0430] An aliquot of the inhibitor of known concentration in DMSO was diluted into 1.8 ml 0.1 M NaOAc, pH 4.0. DMSO and added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v), and memapsin 2 (final concentration of 80 nM), followed by a 20 minute equilibration at 37\ufffd C. Compounds were evaluated for the ability to inhibit memapsin 1 and memapsin 2 at concentrations between about 10 nM and about 10 \u03bcm of inhibitor. Proteolytic activity in presence of inhibitor was measured by addition of 20 \u03bcl of 300 \u03bcM substrate FS-2 dissolved in DMSO and increase in fluorescence intensity measured as previously described (Ermolieff, J., et al., Biochemistry 39:12450-12456 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety)., 726881=[0252] To a solution of 17 (157 mg, 0.36 mol) in DME/H2O(3:1, 8 mL) was added NBS (70.8 mg, 0.4 mmol) at 0\ufffd C. After stirring for 45 minutes at 0\ufffd C., the reaction was quenched by the addition of H2O and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3, brine and dried over MgSO4. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave a residue which was purified by column chromatography (10% EtOAc in hexanes) to give 18 (59%)., 762221=[0314]1H-NMR (500 MHZ, CDCl3) \u03b40.09 (s, 3H), 0.10 (s, 3H), 0.91 (s, 9H), 0.92-0.98 (m, 12H), 1.10 (d, 3H, J=6.7 Hz), 1.25 (m 1H), 1.44 (m, 1H), 1.46 (s, 9H), 1.63 (m, 1H), 1.74 (br s, 1H), 1.80 (m, 1H), 2.18 (m, 1H), 2.56 (m, 1H), 3.62-3.78 (m, 2H), 4.13 (m, 1H), 4.48-4.56 (m, 3H), 6.35 (br d, 1H, J=8.5 Hz), 6.41 (br s, 1H), 7.26-7.40 (m, 5H)., 624616=[0129] The Kiapp (apparent Ki) values of inhibitors against memapsins 1 and 2 were determined employing previously described procedures (Ermolieff, J., et al., Biochemistry 39:12450-12456 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). The relationship of Ki (independent of substrate concentration) to Kiapp is a function of substrate concentration in the assay and the Km for cleavage of the substrate by either memapsin 1 or memapsin 2 by the relationship:, 630475=[0140] Compounds that selectively inhibit memapsin 2 \u03b2-secretase activity relative to memapsin 1 \u03b2-secretase activity are useful to treat diseases or conditions or biological processes association with memapsin 2 \u03b2-secretase activity rather than diseases or conditions or biological processes associated with both memapsin 1 and memapsin 2 \u03b2-secretase activity. Since both memapsin 1 and memapsin 2 cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) at a \u03b2-secretase site to form \u03b2-amyloid protein (also referred to herein as A\u03b2, Abeta or \u03b2-amyloid peptide), memapsin 1 and memapsin 2 have \u03b2-secretase activity (Hussain, I., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:23322-23328 (2001), the teachings of which are incorporated herein in their entirety). However, the \u03b2-secretase activity of memapsin 1 is significantly less than the \u03b2-secretase activity of memapsin 2 (Hussain, I., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:23322-23328 (2001), the teachings of which are incorporated herein in their entirety). Memapsin 2 is localized in the brain, and pancreas, and other tissues (Lin, X., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 97:1456-1460 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein in their entirety) and memapsin 1 is localized preferentially in placentae (Lin, X., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 97:1456-1460 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein in their entirety). Alzheimer's disease is associated with the accumulation of A\u03b2 in the brain as a result of cleaving of APP by \u03b2-secretase (also referred to herein as memapsin 2, ASP2 and BACE). Thus, methods employing the compounds which selectively inhibit memapsin 2 \u03b2-secretase activity relative to memapsin 1 \u03b2-secretase activity are important in the treatment of memapsin 2-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Selective inhibition of memapsin 2 \u03b2-secretase activity makes the compounds of the invention suitable drug candidates for use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease., 915619=[0459] The crystal structure of OM99-2 bound to memapsin 2 is previously described in monoclinic space group P21 (Hong, L., et al., Science 290:150-3 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). In this study, the structures of OM99-2 and OM00-3/memapsin 2 complexes were solved and compared in the same space group-P212121 (Table 10)., 651864=[0164] In yet another embodiment, the invention is a crystallized protein comprising a protein encoded by SEQ ID NO: 5 (FIG. 8) and a compound, wherein the compound is a compound of the invention and wherein the crystallized protein has an x-ray diffraction resolution limit not greater than about 4.0 \u212b (e.g., 3.5 \u212b, 3.0 \u212b, 2.5 \u212b, 2.0 \u212b, 1.5 \u212b, 1.0 \u212b, 0.5 \u212b). SEQ ID NO: 5 is the nucleic acid sequence which encodes memapsin 2 protein (FIG. 8). As discussed above, the crystallized protein is formed employing techniques described herein (infra). Briefly, the nucleic acid construct of SEQ ID NO: 5 is expressed in a host cell, such as a mammalian host cell (e.g., Hela cell, 293 cell) or a bacterial host cell (e.g., E. coli) and the encoded protein is purified. The purified protein is crystallized with a compound or compounds of the invention. The diffraction resolution limit of the crystallized protein can be determined. SEQ ID NO: 5 can optionally lack the nucleic acids which encode the transmembrane domain of memapsin 2. The transmembrane domain is encoded by encoded nucleic acids 1363-1440 of SEQ ID NO: 5. In a particular embodiment, the crystallized protein has an x-ray diffraction resolution limit not greater than about 2 \u212b., 1017967=[0554] The tg2576 transgenic mouse expresses the human Swedish amyloid precursor protein (APP) under control of the prion promoter to direct expression mainly in the brain (Hsiao, K., et al., Science 274:99-102 (1996), the teachings of which are incorporated hereby in their entirety). The A\u03b2 peptide produced in the brain can be detected in plasma of these transgenic animals from ages 3-12 months (Kawarabayashi, T., et al., J. Neurosci. 21:372-381 (2001), the teachings of which are incorporated hereby in their entirety) and results from its efflux from the brain, known to occur within minutes (Ghersi-Egea, et al., J. Neurochem. 67:880-883 (1996), the teachings of which are incorporated hereby in their entirety). Thus, monitoring the plasma A\u03b2 provides a useful continuous measurement of effective inhibition of A\u03b2 production in the brain., 815099=[0326] To a stirred solution of triphosgene (132 mg, 0.44 mmol) in methylene chloride (2 mL) at 23\ufffd C., a solution of L-methionine methyl ester hydrochloride 50 (242 mg, 1.21 mmol) and triethylamine (0.42 mL, 3.03 mmol) in methylene chloride (4 mL) was added slowly over a period of 30 minutes using a syringe pump. After further 5 minutes of stirring, a solution of (3,5-dimethyl-pyrazol-1-yl)-methanol 49 (152 mg, 1.21 mmol) in methylene chloride was added in one portion. The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 hours, diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with water, brine dried over NaSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (50% EtOAC /Hexane) to give 143 mg (36%) of the compound 65. 1H-NMR (300 MHZ, CDCl3): \u03b41.94-2.20 (2H, m), 2.0 (3H, s), 2.18 (3H, s), 2.26 (3H, s), 2.41 (2H, m), 3.74 (3H, s), 4.48 (1H, m), 5.50 (1H, br s), 5.82 (1H, s), 5.90 (2H, s)., 679384=[0198] The standard error for the Ki apparent is the error from the nonlinear regression of the Vi/Vo data measured at different concentrations of the compounds of the invention (e.g., between about 10 nM to about 1000 nM) employing well-known techniques (see, for example, Bieth, J., Bayer-Symposium V: Proteinase Inhibitors, pp. 463-469, Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1994))., 255014=[0057]FIGS. 22A and 22B depict a decrease in the plasma levels of \u03b2-amyloid protein (A\u03b2) following the administration of the inhibitor compounds MMI-138, MMI-165 and MMI-185 to transgenic tg2576 mice., 298659=[0124] \u201cRelative to memapsin 1,\u201d as used herein, refers to the \u03b2-secretase activity of memapsin 2 compared to the \u03b2-secretase activity of memapsin 1. The ability of an inhibitor compound of the invention to inhibit \u03b2-secretase activity can be assessed by determining the extent to which a compound inhibits memapsin 2 cleaving of a \u03b2-secretase site of a \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein compared to the extent to which the same compound inhibits memapsin 1 cleaving of a \u03b2-secretase site of a \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein. These data can be expressed, for example, as Ki, Ki apparent, Vi/Vo, or percentage inhibition and depict the inhibition of a compound for memapsin 2 \u03b2-secretase activity relative to memapsin 1 \u03b2-secretase activity. For example, if the Ki of a reaction between an inhibitor compound of the invention and memapsin 1 is 1000 and the Ki of a reaction between an inhibitor compound of the invention and memapsin 2 is 100, the inhibitor compound inhibits the \u03b2-secretase activity of memapsin 2 ten (10) fold, relative to memapsin 1., 818882=[0333] Dipeptide isostere 6 (42 mg, 0.1 mmol) and compound 67 (41 mg, 0.2 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (2 mL). To this solution, HOBt (20 mg, 0.15 mmol), EDC (29 mg, 0.15 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.2 mL) were added successively at 0\ufffd C. After the addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 23\ufffd C. and it was stirred overnight. The mixture was poured into aqueous NaHCO3 and it was extracted with 30% EtOAc/hexane. The organic layer was washed with brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave a residue which was purified by column chromatography (20% EtOAc/hexane) to give 55 mg (95%) of compound 68. 1H-NMR (500 MHZ, CDCl3) \u03b40.09 (3H, s), 0.10 (3H, s), 0.91 (9H, s), 0.92-0.98 (12H, m), 1.10 (3H, d, J=6.7 Hz), 1.25 (1H, m), 1.44 (1H, m), 1.46 (9H, s), 1.63 (1H, m), 1.74 (1H, br s), 1.80 (1H, m), 2.18 (1H, m), 2.56 (1H, m), 3.62-3.78 (2H, m), 4.13 (1H, m), 4.48-4.56 (3H, m), 6.35 (1H, br d, J=8.5 Hz), 6.41 (1H, br s), 7.26-7.40 (5H, m)., 974781=[0495] OM01-1 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 25 mg/ml. Memapsin 2 (amino acids 60-456 of SEQ ID NO: 8 (FIG. 11)) was produced as described above. The purified memapsin 2 protein was concentrated to 40 mg/ml and was mixed with the 25 mg/ml OM01-1 solution, such that the final concentration of DMSO was 10%, and the final concentration of OM01-1 was 2.5 mg/ml. Crystallization buffer (20% PEG 8000, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.5) was combined with the memapsin 2/OM01-1 complex mixture, and mixed 1:1 (vol:vol) with the crystallization buffer (well solution), and allowed to equilibrate with the well solution at 20 \ufffd C. according to the established hanging drop procedure., 296323=[0121] The compounds of the invention (also referred to herein as \u201can inhibitor(s)\u201d or \u201can inhibitor compound(s)\u201d) are referenced by a number. The inhibitors are also referred to as \u201cGT-1\u201d followed by a numeric designation (e.g., GT-1138), \u201cMM\u201d followed by a numeric designation (e.g., MM 138), \u201cMMI\u201d followed by a numeric designation (e.g., MMI-138) or \u201cOM\u201d followed by a numeric designation (e.g., OM-138). The designations \u201cGT-1,\u201d \u201cMM,\u201d \u201cMMI\u201d and \u201cOM,\u201d as described herein, are equivalent. Likewise, use of the numerical value following the designation \u201cGT-1,\u201d \u201cMM,\u201d \u201cMMI\u201d and \u201cOM\u201d without \u201cGT-1,\u201d \u201cMM,\u201d \u201cMMI\u201d and \u201cOM\u201d refer to the same compound with the \u201cGT-1,\u201d \u201cMM,\u201d \u201cMMI\u201d and \u201cOM\u201d prefix. Thus, for example, \u201cGT-1138,\u201d \u201cMM 138,\u201d \u201cMMI-138,\u201d \u201cOM-138\u201dand \u201c138\u201d refer to the same inhibitor compound., 741192=[0274] Ozone was bubbled through a solution of 32 (250 mg, 0.768 mmol) in CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:1, 20 mL) at \u221278\ufffd C. until the blue color persisted. The solution was then flushed with N2 for 10 minutes. Me2S was added (0.31 mL, 4.23 mmol) slowly and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After being stirred for 12 hours, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was purified by column chromatography (30% EtOAc in hexanes) to give 33 (155 mg, 62%)., 826809=[0356]1H-NMR (300 MHZ, CD3OD): \u03b40.77-0.85 (18H, m), 1.10 (3H, d, J=6.0 Hz), 1.16-2.0 (9H, m), 1.98 (3H, s), 2.42 (2H, t, J=5.6 Hz), 2.50 (1H, m), 2.84 (1H, m), 3.00 (1H, m), 3.40 (1H, m), 3.72 (1H, m), 3.78 (3H, s), 3.94 (1H, m) 4.18 (1H, m), 5.0 (2H, s), 6.20 (1H, s), 7.36 (1H, s)., 870720=[0443] The data depicted in FIG. 3 was calculated from the Ki apparent data depicted in Table 9. The inhibitors GT-1017 (also referred to herein as 017 and MMI-017), GT-1026 (also referred to herein as MMI-026) and OM00-3 have natural amino acids in the P3 position, whereas inhibitor GT-1138 (also referred to herein as MMI-138) has a 3,5-dimethylphrazolyl derivative at the P3 carbonyl. As shown in FIG. 3, the inhibitor MMI-138 resulted in about 60 fold selectivity of memapsin 1 relative to memapsin 2., 825973=[0352]1H-NMR (500 MHZ, CD3OD): \u03b40.75-0.81 (18H, m), 1.0 (3H, d, J=6.8 Hz), 1.1 (9H, s), 1.2 (9H, s), 1.10-2.0 (9H, m), 1.90 (3H, s), 2.35 (2H, t, J=5.3 Hz), 2.60 (1H, m), 2.80 (1H, m), 2.90 (1H, m), 3.30 (1H, m), 3.60 (1H, m) 3.90 (1H, m), 4.10 (1H, m), 4.20 (2H, m), 5.70 (1H, s)., 912884=[0455] Molecular replacement solutions were obtained for both crystals with the program AmoRe (Navaza, J., Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 57:1367-72 (2001), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) using the previously determined memapsin 2 structure (Identifier Code: PDB ID 1FKN) as the search model. Translation search confirmed the two crystal forms are isomorphous in space group P212121 (Table 7) with two memapsin 2/inhibitor complexes per crystallographic asymmetric unit. The refinement was completed with iterative cycles of manual model fitting using graphics program 0 (Jones, T. A., et al., Acta Crystallogr A 47:110-9 (1991), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) and model refinement using CNS (Brunger, A. T., et al., Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 54:905-21 (1998), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). Water molecules were added at the later stages of refinement as identified in |Fo|\u2212|Fc| maps contoured at 3 \u03c3 level. Ten percent of the diffraction data were excluded from the refinement at the beginning of the process to monitor the Rfree values. The two memapsin 2/inhibitor complexes in the crystallographic asymmetric unit were found to be essentially identical. The coordinates for the structure reported here have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Accession Code 1M4H)., 817538=[0331] To a stirred solution of N-Boc-Valine (500 mg,, 2.3 mmol) and benzylamine (0.50 mL, 4.60 mmol) in a mixture of CH2Cl2 (20 mL) and DMF (2 mL), HOBt (373 mg, 2.8 mmol), EDC (529 mg, 2.8 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (2.4 mL, 13.8 mmol) were added successively at 0\ufffd C. After the addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 23\ufffd C. and it was stirred overnight. The mixture was poured into aqueous NaHCO3 solution and the mixture was extracted with 30% EtOAc/hexane. The organic layer was washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave a residue which was purified by flash column chromatography (30% EtOAc/hexane) to give 442 mg (63%) of coupled product. The resulting amine was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (20 mL), and TFA (4 mL) was added at 23\ufffd C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes and then it was concentrated under reduced pressure to provide the compound 67 (297 mg, quantitative). 1H-NMR (500 MHZ, CDCl3): \u03b40.87 (3H, d, J=6.9 Hz), 1.02 (3H, d, J=6.9 Hz), 2.00 (2H, br s), 2.37 (1H, m), 3.36 (1H, br s), 4.43-4.52 (2H, m), 7.27-7.37 (5H, m), 7.70 (1H, brs)., 650400=[0163] In still another embodiment, the invention is a crystallized protein comprising a protein of SEQ ID NO: 6 (FIG. 9) and a compound, wherein the compound is a compound of the invention and wherein the crystallized protein has an x-ray diffraction resolution limit not greater than about 4.0 \u212b (e.g., 3.5 \u212b, 3.0 \u212b, 2.5 \u212b, 2.0 \u212b, 1.5 \u212b, 1.0 \u212b, 0.5 \u212b). SEQ ID NO: 6 is the amino acid sequence of memapsin 2 protein (also referred to herein as BACE, ASP2, \u03b2-secretase). As discussed above, the crystallized protein is formed employing techniques described herein (infra). Briefly, a nucleic acid construct encoding SEQ ID NO: 6 is generated, is expressed in a host cell, such as a mammalian host cell (e.g., Hela cell, 293 cell) or a bacterial host cell (e.g., E. coli), is purified and is crystallized with a compound or compounds of the invention. The diffraction resolution limit of the crystallized protein can be determined, for example, by x-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction techniques. SEQ ID NO: 6 can optionally lack a transmembrane domain. The transmembrane of memapsin 2 is amino acid residues 455-480 of SEQ ID NO: 6 (FIG. 9), which is the amino acid sequence LMTIAYVMAAICALFMLPLCLMVCQW (SEQ ID NO: 6) which is encoded by nucleic acids 1363-1440 of SEQ ID NO: 5 (FIG. 8). In a particular embodiment, the crystallized protein has an x-ray diffraction resolution limit not greater than about 2 \u212b., 1019710=[0558] Compounds MMI-138, MMI-165, and MMI-185 were synthesized as described above. Compounds were dissolved in 1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of about 1 mg/ml for MMI-165 and MMI-185, and about 10 mg/ml for MMI-138. Inhibitor OM00-3 was synthesized as described above and dissolved in DMSO to about 10 mg/ml. Inhibitors were diluted into PBS or H2O immediately prior to injection, as described below.

R., et al., Science 285:1569-1572 (1999), the teachings of which are incorporated herein in their entirety) or nine arginine residues Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg (SEQ ID NO: 14) (Wender, P. A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:13003-13008 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein in their entirety). In another embodiment, the carrier molecule includes cationic molecules (i.e., molecules that are ionized at physiologic pH) and preferably polycationic molecules. Preferred functional groups that form cations include guanidine, amino, or imidizole. Carrier molecules include saccharides or lipids that contain about 1-10 of the following functional groups: guanidine, amino, or imidizole. Carrier molecules also include peptides of length about 10 amino acids, consisting of a combination of about 1-10 lysine, 1-10 arginine, or 1-10 histidine residues, or 1-10 residues of amino acids that contain the following functional groups: guanidine, amino, or imidizole. Carrier molecules also include other constructions that are not peptides but contain the side chains of amino acids, consisting of a combination of about 1-10 lysine, 1-10 lysine, 1-10 arginine, or 1-10 histidine side chains, or 1-10 side chains that contain the following functional groups: guanidine, amino, or imidizole. When a compound of the invention is conjugated or attached to a carrier molecule, the resulting conjugate is referred to herein as a \u201cCarrier Peptide-Inhibitor\u201d conjugate or \u201cCPI.\u201d The CPI conjugate can be administered to an in vitro sample or to a mammal thereby serving as a transport vehicle for a compound or compounds of the invention into a cell in an in vitro sample or in a mammal. The carrier molecules and CPI conjugates result in an increase in the ability of the compounds of the invention to effectively penetrate cells and the blood brain barrier to inhibit memapsin 2 from cleaving APP to subsequently generate A\u03b2., 699361=[0218] To a stirred solution of N,O-dimethylhydroxyamine hydrochloride (5.52 g, 56.6 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (25 mL) under a N2 atmosphere at 0\ufffd C., was added N-methylpiperidine (6.9 mL, 56.6 mmol) dropwise. The resulting mixture was stirred at 0\ufffd C. for 30 minutes. In a separate flask, commercially available N-(t-butyloxycarbonyl)-L-leucine (11.9 g, 51.4 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (45 mL) and dichloromethane (180 mL) under a N2 atmosphere. The resulting solution was cooled to \u221220\ufffd C. To this solution was added 1-methylpiperidine (6.9 mL, 56.6 mmol) followed by isobutyl chloroformate (7.3 mL, 56.6 mmol) dropwise. The resulting mixture was stirred for 5 minutes at \u221220\ufffd C. and the above solution of N,O-dimethyl-hydroxylamine was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred at \u221220\ufffd C. for 30 minutes followed by warming to room temperature. The reaction was quenched with water and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 times). The combined organic layers were washed with 10% citric acid, saturated sodium bicarbonate, brine, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography (25% ethyl acetate (EtOAc) in hexanes) yielded 1 (13.8 g, 97%).

The relationship of Ki (independent of substrate concentration) to Kiapp is a function of substrate concentration in the assay and the Km for cleavage of the substrate by either memapsin 1 or memapsin 2 by the relationship:, 824457=[0344]1H-NMR (300 MHZ, CD3OD): \u03b40.80-0.97 (12H, m), 1.40 (9H, m,), 1.18-2.20 (8H, m), 2.0 (3H, s), 2.18 (3H, s), 2.26 (3H, s), 2.50 (3H, m), 3.42 (1H, m), 3.80 (1H, m), 3.90 (2H, m), 4.20 (1H, m), 5.80 (3H, s)., 1013099=[0549] To study the duration of inhibition, eight tg2576 mice were injected intraperitoneally with inhibitor CPI-3. The plasma A\u03b240 level dropped to about one third of the initial value at 2 hours following injection (FIG. 21B), consistent with presence of CPI-3 in the brain in the same range of time verified by confocal microscopy. The inhibition had a relatively short half-life of 3 hours, with the plasma A\u03b240 level then gradually returning to the initial value by 8 hours (FIG. 21B), consistent with the observed disappearance of fluorescent inhibitor CPI-3 from brains of mice at 8 hours post-injection, observed by confocal microscopy. Injecting either the unconjugated inhibitor OM00-3 or the peptide analogue of CPI-3 without the transition-state isostere (FIG. 21C \u201cpeptide\u201d) did not reduce plasma A\u03b240 levels. The latter established that the carrier molecule was not responsible for the observed inhibition, nor did it facilitate a general permeabilization of the blood brain barrier, as simultaneous injection with the peptide analogue of CPI-3 and the inhibitor OM00-3 did not decrease plasma A\u03b240 (FIG. 21 COM00-3+peptide). The percentage of A\u03b240 relative to total A\u03b2 was constant at 73\ufffd8% and 75\ufffd5% for A\u03b2 levels ranging from about 1000 to about 5000 pg/ml in treated and untreated animals, respectively. These observations established that the measured A\u03b240 changes may be taken as the change of total A\u03b2 in the observed range of inhibition., 730662=[0258] To a solution of 22 (46.5 mg, 0.15 mmol) in DME:H2O (1:1, 3 mL) was added 1 N LiOH (0.46 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours followed by acidification with 1 N HCl to pH 3 and extraction with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried with Na2SO4, concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by column chromatography to yield a mixture of products. The mixture (44 mg, 0.13 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (1 mL) and imidazole (207 mg, 3.04 mmol) and TBSCl (209 mg, 1.38 mmol) was added and stirred for 12 hours. The reaction was quenched MeOH (1 mL), stirred for 1 hour, acidified with 5% citric acid to pH 3, extracted with EtOAc, dried with Na2SO4, concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by column chromatography to yield 23 (13.8 mg) and the isostere 24 (37.6 mg)., 948270=[0468] Glu and Phe comprise P3\u2032 and P4\u2032 for both of the inhibitors. Unlike the results obtained in space group P21 (Hong, L., et al., Science 290:150-3 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety), the positions of P3\u2032 and P4\u2032 are better defined by electron density in space group P212121. However, FIG. 13 shows that the average B factors for the P3\u2032 and P4\u2032 residues in the OM00-3 structure are considerably lower than that of the OM99-2 (the values are 27.1 and 37.6 for the former and 39.2 and 47.0 for the latter, respectively). Since the conformations of the inhibitor and the enzyme are nearly identical at these positions, an improved structure stability in OM00-3 at these two C-terminal residues, evidenced by lower average B factors, benefits inhibitor binding energetically, which consists of van der Waals contacts at P3\u2032 and P4\u2032. Considering the conformational and chemical resemblance at P3\u2032 and P4\u2032 between OM99-2 and OM00-3, it is considered that the large differences in B factors are caused by the Ala to Val change at P2\u2032. As discussed, Val improves the fit between the inhibitor and the enzyme at this position. The enhanced binding at P2\u2032 may stabilize the relative mobile P3\u2032 and P4\u2032., 716452=[0236] LiOH (66 mg, 1.58 mmol) was added to a solution of 7 (325 mg, 1.05 mmol) in dioxane/water (3:1, 4 mL) and stirred for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was acidified to pH 3 with 25% aqueous citric acid, extracted with EtOAc, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the corresponding hydroxyl acid (307 mg, 89%)., 718731=[0240] Ozone was bubbled through a solution of compound 9 in CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:1, 6 mL) at \u221278\ufffd C. until the blue color persisted (ca. 10 minutes). Oxygen was bubbled through the mixture until the blue color dissipated after which nitrogen was bubbled through the mixture for 10 minutes. Triphenylphosphine (124 mg, 0.47 mmol) was added at \u221278\ufffd C. and the mixture stirred and allowed to warm to room, temperature over 1 hour. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column chromatography (30% EtOAc in hexanes) to yield the corresponding aldehyde (86 mg, 56%)., 998520=[0519] To collect single cell suspensions, spleens and brain hemispheres were homogenized through a 30 \u03bcm screen and directly analyzed by flow cytometric analysis. An alternative means to staining brain cells was first to permeabilize them in 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS, blocked with 1% normal rabbit serum, incubated with 1:50 diluted Alexa Fluor 488\u2122 conjugated anti-fluorescein (1 mg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) for 30 minutes, then analyzed by flow cytometric analysis., 821405=[0338] To a solution of MMI-138 (10 mg, 0.015 mmol) in MeOH\u2014H2O (1:1) (2 mL), were added NaHCO3 (11.6 mg, 0.12 mmol) and potassium peroxymonosulfate (OXONE\ufffd) (27 mg, 0.05 mmol) and stirred for 12 hours. The reaction was then diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with water and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave a residue which was purified by column chromatography (4% MeOH/CHCl3) to provide the inhibitor MMI-139 (6.8 mg, 65%). 1H-NMR (300 MHZ, CD3OD): \u03b40.72-0.92 (12H, m), 1.20 (3H, d, J=6.0 Hz), 1.15-2.06 (6H, m), 2.16 (3H, s), 2.24 (3H, s), 2.58 (3H, s), 2.82 (3H, s), 3.30 (2H, m), 3.60 (1H, m), 3.78 (1H, m), 4.0 (2H, m), 4.22 (1H, m),4.34-4.38 (3H, m), 5.80 (3H, s), 7.18-7.36 (5H, m)., 733329=[0261] LiOH (32 mg, 0.77 mmol) was added to a solution of 26 (242 mg, 0.51 mmol) in dioxane/water (3:1, 4 mL) and stirred for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was acidified to pH 3 with 25% aqueous citric acid, extracted with EtOAc, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the corresponding hydroxy acid (240 mg, 96%)., 725087=[0249] To a solution of known carboxylic acid 18 (Tetrahedron 1996, 8451) (1.05 g, 6.78 mmol) in THF (30 mL) at \u221220\ufffd C. was added Et3N (1.2 mL, 8.82 mmol) dropwise followed by pivaloyl chloride (1.08 mL, 8.82 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at \u221220\ufffd C. followed by cooling to \u221278\ufffd C., 656826=[0176] Memapsin 2 (amino acid residues 1-456 of SEQ ID NO: 8 (FIG. 11)) was produced recombinantly in E. coli. (Lin, X., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:1456-1460 (2000))., 738127=[0270] To a solution of known epoxide 30 (Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 2753-2756) (229 mg, 1.0 mmol) in MeOH (5 mL) was added methylamine (2.5 mL, 2.0 M solution in MeOH, 5.0 mmol) and the resulting mixture was stirred for 4-5 hours at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column chromatography (50% EtOAc in hexanes) to afford 31 (90% yield)., 990015=[0506] The carrier molecule peptide employed in these experiments was a peptide derived from a segment of the HIV tat protein (amino acid residues 47-57) (Schwarze, S.

A Vi/Vo value of 1.0 indicates that a compound of the invention does not inhibit the \u03b2-secretase activity of the enzyme memapsin 1 or memapsin 2. A Vi/Vo value less than 1.0 indicates that a compound of the invention inhibits \u03b2-secretase activity of the enzyme memapsin 1 or memapsin 2. The Vi/Vo values depicted in Table 1 were determined at conditions under which the enzyme and inhibitor concentrations were equal (e.g., about 80 nM, 100 nM)., 910900=[0451] Promemapsin 2-T1 (amino acid residues 1-456 of SEQ ID NO: 8 (FIG. 11)) was expressed in E. coli as an inclusion body and subsequently refolded and purified as previously described (Lin, X., et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97: 1456-60 (2000); Ermolieff, J., et al., Biochemistry 39:12450-6 (2000), the teachings of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). Crystallization of memapsin 2 amino acid residues 43-456 of SEQ ID NO: 8 (FIG. 11); amino acid residues 45-456 of SEQ ID NO: 8 (FIG. 11) complexed with OM99-2 and OM00-3 were carried out using established procedures (Hong, L., et al., Science 290:150-3 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) with minor modifications. For Memapsin2/OM99-2, the crystals were grown at 20\ufffd C. in 25% PEG (polyethylene glycol) 8000, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4 buffered with 0.1 M Na-Cacodylate at pH 6.5 using hanging drop vapor diffusion method with 1:1 volume ratio of well to sample solution. For OM00-3, 22.5% PEG 8000 was used at pH 6.2. Orthorhombic crystals were obtained under these conditions., 624182=[0128] The standard error for the Ki apparent is the error from the nonlinear regression of the Vi/Vo data measured at different concentrations of the compounds of the invention (e.g., between about 10 nM to about 1000 nM) employing well-known techniques (see, for example, Bieth, J., Bayer-Symposium V. Proteinase Inhibitors, pp. 463-469, Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1994))., 907424=[0448] The hallmark of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degeneration of the brain caused by the accumulation of amyloid beta peptide, as referred to herein as amyloid protein (Selkoe, D. J., Physiol Rev 81:741-66 (2001)). The first step in the production of \u03b2-amyloid protein is the cleavage of a membrane protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP) by a protease known as the \u03b2-secretase, which has been identified as a membrane anchored aspartic protease termed memapsin 2 (or BACE or ASP-2). A first-generation inhibitor OM99-2 (Ghosh, A. K., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122.3522-3523 (2000)) was designed based on substrate information (Lin, X., et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97:1456-60 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) which is an eight-residue transition-state analogue, EVNL*AAEF (SEQ ID NO: 20) with Ki near 1 nM (Ermolieff, J., et al., Biochemistry 39:12450-6 (2000)). A 1.9-\u212b crystal structure of the catalytic unit of memapsin 2 bound to OM99-2 (Hong, L., et al., Science 290:150-3 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) revealed that the conformation of the protease and the main features of its active site are those of the aspartic proteases of the pepsin family. All eight residues of OM99-2 were accommodated within the substrate-binding cleft of memapsin 2. The locations and structures of six memapsin 2 subsites for the binding of residues P4 to P2\u2032 of OM99-2 were clearly defined in the structure (Hong, L., et al., Science 290:150-3 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). This part of the inhibitor assumed an essentially extended conformation with the active-site aspartyls positioned near the transition-state isostere between P1 and P1\u2032. Unexpectedly, the backbone of the inhibitor turned at P2\u2032 Ala, departing from the extended conformation, to produce a kink. With less defined electron density, the side chains of P3\u2032 Glu and P4\u2032 Phe appeared to be located on the molecular surface and to have little interaction with the protease. These observations led to the idea that the S3\u2032 and S4\u2032 subsites in memapsin 2 were not well formed and perhaps contributed little to the interaction with substrates and inhibitors (Hong, L., et al., Science 290:150-3 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety)., 918755=[0463] OM99-2 was designed based on the Swedish Mutation of APP (SEVNLDAEFR; SEQ ID NO: 11) (Ghosh, A. K., et al., J Med Chem 44:2865-8 (2001), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). In its complex with memapsin 2, the side chains of P2 Asn and Arg235 (SEQ ID NO: 9 (FIG. 12)) form hydrogen bonds, which may contribute to enhanced proteolysis and subsequently elevated A\u03b2 production, leading to the early onset of Alzheimer's Disease (Hong, L., et al., Science 290:150-3 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). In the OM00-3 structure, the P2 side chain is changed to Asp, and the Arg235 side chain adopts a new conformation, forming two salt linkages to the P2 Asp side. These new ionic bonds make additional contributions to the inhibitor binding., 757386=[0306] To a solution of compound 52 (2.1 g, 6.15 mol) in ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME)/H2O (1:1, 40 mL) was added N-bromosuccinamide (NBS) (1.2 g, 6.77 mmol) at 0\ufffd C. After stirring for 45 minutes at 0\ufffd C., the reaction was quenched by the addition of H2O and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3, brine and dried over MgSO4. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave a residue which was purified by column chromatography (10% EtOAc in hexanes) to give compound 52 (727 mg, 45%)., 712621=[0229] To the above hydroxy acid (330 mg, 1.1 mmol) in dimethylformamide (DMF) was added imidazole (1.59 g, 23.34 mmol) and tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane (1.76 g, 11.67 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. MeOH (4 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for an additional 1 hour. The mixture was acidified with 25% aqueous citric acid to pH 3 and was extracted with EtOAc three times. The combined extracts were washed with water, brine, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography (35% EtOAc in hexanes) yielded 6 (0.44 g, 90%).

The reaction was then acidified to pH 3 with 1 M HCl, extracted with CHCl3, dried with Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 35 mg (83%) of 82., 959657=[0473] The structure of the OM00-3/memapsin 2 complex in space group P212121 was determined at 2.1 \u212b using the molecular replacement method. The structure of the enzyme, the interactions of the P1/P1\u2032 (Leu*Ala) region of OM00-3 with the substrate binding cleft of memapsin 2 and the backbone conformation of the inhibitor from P3 to P2\u2032 are essentially the same as in the structure of the OM99-2/memapsin 2 complex. However, the current structure shows different side-chain configurations within the S4, S3 and S2 sub-sites when compared to those of the OM99-2 structure (Hong, L., et al., Science 290:150-3 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). In addition, the locations and nature of S3\u2032 and S4\u2032 binding pockets are defined., 995795=[0513] Kinetic inhibition experiments (FIG. 21), using a procedure as described in Ermolieff, et al. (Biochemistry 39: 12450-12456 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated hereby in their entirety), showed that the conjugated inhibitors CPI-1 and CPI-2 had similar inhibition potencies as their inhibitors, OM99-2 and OM00-3 with Ki apparent values of 39 and 58 nM, respectively (Lin, X., et al., Proc.

The total cell lysates were subject to immunoprecipitation by the addition of 1 \u03bcl of 1 mg/ml of monoclonal antibody raised specifically against human A\u03b217-24 (MAB 1561, Chemicon) with 20 \u03bcl of protein G-sepharose beads. hnmunoprecipitated proteins were denatured in Tricine-SDS sample buffer with 2.5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol by boiling for 5 minutes. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by using 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE (NOVEX) and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Quantitative results were obtained using the STORM\u2122 phosphorimaging system (Amersham)., 997024=[0517] Two- to four-month-old Cd72c mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.3 to 10 nmoles of the conjugates (CPI-1 or CPI-2) or with control fluorescein, in 200 \u03bcl of PBS. Whole blood cells (with EDTA as anti-coagulant in the syringe or in the capillary tube) were isolated from anesthetized animals from the orbital artery or by heart puncture and diluted 1:10 in PBS. Prior to the harvest of other tissue samples, animals were anesthetized and perfused with 150 ml of neutral-buffered 10% formalin. Spleens were harvested intact. Brains were harvested and cerebral hemispheres separated, one for sectioning by cryostat, the other for single cell isolation for flow cytometry., 833418=[0371] To a solution of compound 77 (184 mg, 1 mmol) in acetone/H2O (3:1, 20 mL) was added N-methyl morpholine N-oxide (292 mg, 2.5 mmol) followed by OSO4 (0.38 mL, 2 wt % in t-BuOH, 0.03 mmol) and stirred overnight. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 and washed with water. The organic layer was dried with Na2SO4, concentrated under reduced pressure and chromatographed (4% MeOH in CHC3) to yield compound 78 (110 mg, 51%)., 274677=[0093] \u201cBinding pockets\u201d or \u201cbinding subsites\u201d or subsites\u201crefer to locations in an enzyme or protease that interact with functional groups or side chains of a compound or substrate bond thereto. The subsites in memapsin 1 and memapsin 2 are labeled Sq and Sq\u2032 and interact with or otherwise accommodate side chains Pq and Pq\u2032 of a peptide substrate or peptide isostere, such as the compounds of the invention, such that the Pq side chain of the peptide substrate or peptide inhibitor interact with amino acid residues in the Sq subsite of the enzyme. q is an integer that increases distally relative to the scissile bond of a peptide substrate that is cleaved by the enzyme or relative to the hydroxyethyl group of a hydroxyethyl isosteric inhibitor, such as the compounds of the invention, according to the nomenclature of Schecter and Berger (Schechter, I., Berger, A Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (1967), 27:157-162). The composition of a subsite is a listing of the amino acids of the enzyme or protease which are within an interacting distance of the compound when the compound is bound to the subsite, or otherwise form a contiguous solvent accessible surface, indicated by their numbers in the amino acid sequence. Representative references to aspartic protease subsites include: Davies, D. R., Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem., 19:189-215 (1990) and Bailey, D. and Cooper, J. B., Protein Science, 3:2129-2143 (1994), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. More specifically, a subsite is defined by defining a group of atoms of the enzyme which represent a contiguous or noncontiguous surface that is accessible to a water molecule, with that surface having the potential for an interaction with a functional group or side chain of a peptide substrate or a peptide inhibitor, such as the compounds of the invention, when the peptide substrate or a peptide inhibitor is bound to the subsite., 820985=[0336]1H-NMR (300 MHZ, CD3OD): \u03b40.80-0.97 (12H, m), 1.10 (3H, d, J=6.7 Hz), 1.20-2.38 (8H, m), 2.0 (3H, s), 2.18 (3H, s), 2.24 (3H, s), 2.41 (3H, t, J=6.4 Hz), 2.60 (1H, m), 3.41 (1H, m), 3.80 (1H, m), 4.15 (1H, m), 4.20-4.32 (3H, m), 5.80 (3H, s) 7.17-7.30 (5H, m)., 1010399=[0541] Kinetic inhibition experiments using a procedure as described in Ermolieff, et al.

The mixture was stirred for 3 hours. After this period, solvents were removed and the residue was acidified with aqueous 1N HCl to pH\u02dc4. The white solid was extracted twice with ethyl acetate and the combined extracts were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to provide compound 66 (134 mg, quantitative) which was carried on to the next step without further purification. 1H-NMR (300 MHZ, CDCl3): \u03b41.94-2.20 (2H, m), 2.0 (3H, s), 2.18 (3H, s), 2.26 (3H, s), 2.48 (2H, m), 3.74 (3H, s), 4.40 (1H, m), 5.50 (1H, br s), 5.82 (1H, s), 5.90 (2H, s)., 972276=[0492] Promemapsin 2-T1 was expressed as outlined in Example 1 and purified. The memapsin 2 used in the crystallization procedure was obtained by activation of promemapsin 2-T1 (SEQ ID NO 8 as shown in FIG. 11) with clostripain and purification by anion exchange FPLC (Ermolieff et al., Biochemistry 39: 12450-12456 (2000)). The activated memapsin 2 corresponded to amino acids 60-456 of SEQ ID NO 8 (as shown in FIG. 11)., 744407=[0279] Ozone was bubbled through a solution of 36 (400 mg, 1.158 mmol) in CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:1, 30 mL) at \u221278\ufffd C. until the blue color persisted. The solution was then flushed with N2 for 10 minutes. Triphenylphosphine (334 mg, 1.274 mmol) was added slowly and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After being stirred for 15 minutes, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was purified by column chromatography (40% EtOAc in hexanes) to give 37 (336 mg, 84%)., 961922=[0476] In the OM00-3 structure, Leu30 (SEQ ID NO: 9 (FIG. 12)) in S3 of the protease has contacts with the leucines of the inhibitor at P3 and P1. These two side chains also contact each other, contributing to the further stabilization of the inhibitor conformation. These productive interactions are not present in the OM99-2 structure where P3 is Val rather than Leu and the conformation of Leu30 is different as a result of a 60 degree rotation around 1022., 694161=[0211] The combinatorial inhibitor library was based on the sequence of OM99-2: EVNL\u03a8AAEF (SEQ ID NO: 24), where letters represent amino acids in single letter code and \u03a8 represents a hydroxyethylene transition-state isostere, as previously described (U.S. application Ser.

(Ghosh, A. K., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122:3522-3523 (2000), the teachings of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety). Four positions, P2, P3, P2\u2032 and P3\u2032, were filled with random amino acids residues (less cysteine). Positions P1 and P1\u2032 were fixed due to the use of diisostere Leu\u03a8Ala in a single step of solid-state peptide synthesis of inhibitors (Ghosh, A. K., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122:3522-3523 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). By using the split-synthesis procedure (Lam, K. S., et al., Nature 354:82-84 (1991), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety), each of the resin beads contained only one sequence while the sequence differed among beads. The overall library sequence was: Gly-Xx1-Xx2-Leu\u03a8Ala-Xx3-Xx4-Phe-Arg-Met-Gly-Gly-(Resin bead) (SEQ ID NO: 25)., 850373=[0399] To a solution of compound 92 (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. 11:1141 (1988)) (530 mg, 1.64 mmol) in THF at 0\ufffd C. were added NaH (60%, 130 mg, 3.28 mmol) and allyl iodide (0.23 mL, 2.46 mmol) and stirred for 12hours at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl, extracted with diethylether, dried with Na2SO4, concentrated under reduced pressure, and chromatographed (2% EtOAc in hexanes) to yield 530 mg (90%) of allyl ether 93., 858931=[0424] Inhibitor MMI-139: To a solution of MMI-138 (10 mg, 0.015 mmol) in MeOH-H2O (1:1) (2 mL), were added NaHCO3 (11.6 mg, 0.12 mmol) and Oxone\ufffd (potassium peroxymonosulfate) (27 mg, 0.05 mmol) and stirred for 12 hours. The reaction was diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with water and dried with Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave a residue which was purified by column chromatography (4% MeOH in CHCl3) to provide the inhibitor MMI-139 (6.8 mg, 65%). 1H-NMR (300 MHZ, CD3OD): \u03b40.72-0.92 (12H, m), 1.20 (3H, d, J=6.0 Hz), 1.15-2.06 (6H, m), 2.16 (3H, s), 2.24 (3H, s), 2.58 (3H, s), 2.82 (3H, s), 3.30 (2H, m), 3.60 (1H, m), 3.78 (1H, m), 4.0 (2H, m), 4.22 (1H, m), 4.34-4.38 (3H, m), 5.80 (3H, s), 7.18-7.36 (5H, m)., 248559=[0035]FIG. 3 depicts the selectivity of inhibitors (GT-1017, GT-1026, OM00-3 and GT-113) for inhibition of memapsin 2 activity relative to inhibition of memapsin 1 activity., 968703=[0487] The first structure of memapsin 2 catalytic domain complexed to inhibitor OM99-3 (Hong, L., et al., Science 290:150-3 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) has been shown to be useful in the structural based design of smaller and potent memapsin 2 inhibitors (Table 1). The new structure described here provides improved versatility for inhibitor design. Memapsin 2 inhibitors with clinical potentials should be potent, selective and small enough to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. It is known that HIV protease inhibitor drug indinavir, 614 Da, can cross the blood-brain barrier (Martin, et al., Aids 13:1227-32 (1999), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). A memapsin 2 inhibitor of similar size would bind to about five sub-sites consecutively. Inhibitors with Ki at low nM range can be designed without evoking binding at the P3\u2032 and P4\u2032 subsites (Table 1). The new binding modes at P4 and P2 can be utilized for the design of inhibitors of this type. The new sub-site structures of S3\u2032 and S4\u2032 described above can be incorporated in the design of inhibitors with P3 and P4\u2032 but without P4 and P3 residues. Such a design is predicted to have a strong binding side chain, such as Val, at P2\u2032., 666712=[0182] Substrate mixtures were dissolved at 2 mg/ml in 10% glacial acetic acid and diluted into 0.009 M NaOH to obtain a mixture of substrates in the \u03bcM range at pH 4.1. After equilibration at 25\ufffd C., the reactions were initiated by the addition of an aliquot of memapsin 2. Aliquots were removed at time intervals, and combined with an equal volume of MALDI-TOF matrix (\u03b1-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetone, 20 mg/ml) and immediately spotted in duplicate onto a stainless-steel MALDI sample plate. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a PE Biosystems Voyager DE instrument at the Molecular Biology Resource Center on campus. The instrument was operated at 25,000 accelerating volts in positive mode with a 150 ns delay. Ions with a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) were detected in the range of 650-2000 atomic mass units. Data were analyzed by the Voyager Data Explorer module to obtain ion intensity data for mass species of substrates and corresponding products in a given mixture. Relative product formation was calculated as the ratio of signal intensity of the product to the sum of signal intensities of both product and the corresponding substrate. The quantitative aspect of this analysis was established as follows. From a mixture consisting of seven substrate peptides, EVNLXAFFWHDR (SEQ ID NO: 18) (X=amino acids A, S, T, I, D, E, and F), their hydrolytic peptide products, XAEFWHDR (SEQ ID NO: 19), were prepared by complete hydrolysis. A series of mock partial digestions was prepared by combining known amounts of the substrate mixture with the hydrolysate, and each was subjected to MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. The ratios of product to sum of product and substrate peptide from observed intensity data correlated with the expected ratios for each pair of peptides in the mixture (average slope 1.04\ufffd0.01; average intercept 0.019\ufffd0.021; average correlation coefficient 0.987\ufffd0.006). Relative product formed per unit time was obtained from non-linear regression analysis of the data representing the initial 15% formation of product using the model, 708990=[0226] To a stirred solution of lactone 4 (451.8 mg, 1.67 mmol) in THF (8 mL) at \u221278\ufffd C. under a N2 atmosphere, was added dropwise lithium hexamethyldisilazide (3.67 mL, 1.0 M in THF, 3.67 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred at \u221278\ufffd C. for 30 minutes. Methyl iodide (MeI) (228 mL) was added dropwise and the resulting mixture was stirred at \u221278\ufffd C. for 20 minutes. The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl and allowed to warm to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was extracted with EtOAc (three times). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography (15% EtOAc in hexanes) yielded 5 (0.36 g, 76%). The stereochemistry of C2-methyl group was assigned based upon NOESY and COSY experiments. Irradiation of the C2-methyl group exhibited 6% NOE with the C3 \u03b1-proton and 5% NOE with the C4-proton.

The resulting mixture was stirred at \u221278\ufffd C. for 30 minutes. The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl at \u221278\ufffd C. followed by warming to room temperature. Brine was added and the layers were separated. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure.

The resulting mixture was placed under a hydrogen balloon and stirred for 1 hour. After this period, the reaction was filtered through a pad of Celite and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in toluene (20 mL) and acetic acid (100 L). The resulting mixture was refluxed for 6 hours followed by cooling to room temperature and concentrating under reduced pressure.

Diffraction data were collected on a Mar 345 image plate mounted on a Msc-Rigaku RU-300 X-ray generator with Osmic focusing mirrors. The data were processed using the HKL program package (Otwinowski, Z., et al., W. Methods in Enzymol. 276:307-326 (1997), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). Statistics are shown in Table 10., 677637=[0194] The kinetic parameters, KM and kcat, using single peptide substrate, and Ki against free inhibitors, were determined as previously described (Ermolieff, J. et al., Biochemistry 39:12450-12456 (2000))., 1012572=[0548] At ages up to 9 months, plasma A\u03b2 in the tg2576 mice serves as a reliable marker for brain A\u03b2 production as a result of memapsin 2 activity (Kawarabayashi, T., et al., J Neurosci. 21:372-381 (2001)). Nine tg2576 mice were injected intraperitoneally with various doses of inhibitor CPI-3. Two hours following the injection of CPI-3, plasma A\u03b240 showed a significant dose-dependent reduction relative to A\u03b240 from control mice injected with PBS (FIG. 21A)., 655101=[0172] The protease domain of memapsin 1 (amino acid residues 15-461 of SEQ ID NO: 4 (FIG. 7)) was expressed in E. coli as previously described for memapsin 2 (Lin, X., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:1456-1460 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety)., 628949=[0136] In another embodiment, memapsin 2 is promemapsin 2-T1 (nucleic acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 7 (FIG. 10); amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 8 (FIG. 11)) and can be derived from nucleotides 40-1362 of SEQ ID NO: 5 (FIG. 8)., 1016754=[0553] Although many of the compounds of the invention demonstrate strong inhibition of memapsin 2 (amino acid residues 43-456 of SEQ ID NO: 8 (FIG. 11) and amino acid residues 45-456 of SEQ ID NO: 8 (FIG. 11)) in the in vitro fluorogenic assay, it was unknown whether any of these compounds could inhibit A\u03b2 (also referred to herein as \u03b2-amyloid protein) production in vivo. Generally, the molecular size of the compounds would be considered too large to permit crossing of the blood brain barrier. Restrictions of about 500 g/mole or less have been reported (Brightman, M. W., et al., Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 202:63-78 (1995); Zolkovic, B., Neurobiol. Dis. 4:23-26 (1997); Egleton, R. D., et al., Peptides 18:1431-1439 (1997); van de Waterbeemd, H., et al., J. Drug Target 6:151-165 (1998), the teachings of all of which are incorporated hereby in their entirety). A critical feature required for the action of a compound to block A\u03b2 production is that the compound can penetrate the blood brain barrier. The brain is an important site of action in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease since the brain mediates memory and cognition., 221317=[0003] Alzheimer's disease is a progressive mental deterioration in a human resulting, inter alia, in loss of memory, confusion and disorientation. Alzheimer's disease accounts for the majority of sentile dementias and is a leading cause of death in adults (Anderson, R. N., Natl. Vital Stat. Rep. 49:1-87 (2001), the teachings of which are incorporated herein in their entirety). Histologically, the brain of persons afflicted with Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a distortion of the intracellular neurofibrils and the presence of senile plaques composed of granular or filamentous argentophilic masses with an amyloid protein core, largely due to the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) in the brain. A\u03b2 accumulation plays a role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease (Selkoe, D. J., Nature 399: 23-31 (1999)) and is a proteolytic fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is cleaved initially by \u03b2-secretase followed by \u03b3-secretase to generate A\u03b2 (Lin, X., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:1456-1460 (2000); De Stropper, B., et al., Nature 391:387-390 (1998))., 757128=[0304] Compound 30 was prepared from compound 50 in 71% yield following Evan's protocol (J. Med. Chem. 33:2335-2342 (1990))., 1010953=[0544] Six-month-old tg2576 mice (n=21) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) 200 \u03bcg of conjugate CPI-3 or with control DMSO, in 200 \u03bcl of PBS. Plasma were collected from anesthetized animals by orbital bleed or sephaneous vein into heparinized capillary tubes and clarified by centrifugation. Plasma A\u03b2 1-40 levels were determined by capture ELISA (BioSource International, Camarillo, Calif.). The peptide analogue of CPI-3, with an amide group instead of the hydroxyethylene isostere was synthesized by SynPep (Camarillo, Calif.)., 835108=[0373] Methylmagnesium bromide (5.4 mL, 1.4 M in THF, 7.6 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of (3,5-dimethylpyrazole-1-yl)-acetic acid ethyl ester (J. Med. Chem., p. 1659 (1983)) (compound 79, 554 mg, 3.04 mmol) in THF at 0\ufffd C. After 30 minutes the reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried with Na2SO4, concentrated, and purified by column chromatography (40% EtOAc in hexanes) to yield 276 mg (65%) of compound 80., 825185=[0348]1H-NMR (300 MHZ, CD3OD): \u03b40.80-1.0 (19H, m), 1.10 (3H, d, J=6.2 Hz), 1.20-2.26 (8H, m), 2.0 (3H, s), 2.18 (3H, s), 2.3 (3H, s), 2.5 (2H, m), 2.6 (3H, m), 3.40 (1H, m), 4.10 (1H, m), 4.20 (1H, m), 4.44 (1H, s), 5.84 (3H, s).}",
