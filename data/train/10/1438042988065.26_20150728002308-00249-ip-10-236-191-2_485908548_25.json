The four planar vertical regions 2540 that correspond to region 2508 in FIG. 53, may include heat sources that may create pyrolysis zones. Regions 2548, 2550, and 2552 may include heat sources that apply heat to create a low viscosity zone. Production wells 2500 may be disposed in regions where pyrolysis occurs and may be configured to remove the pyrolyzation fluids. In one embodiment, a length of the pyrolysis zones 2540 may be between about 75 m and about 100 m. In another embodiment, a length of the pyrolysis zones may be between about 100 m and about 125 m. In another embodiment, an average distance between production wells in the same plane may be between about 100 m and about 150 m. In one embodiment, a distance between plane 2542 and plane 2544 may be between about 40 m and about 80 m. In some embodiments, more than one production well may be disposed in a region where pyrolysis occurs. Plane 2542 and plane 2544 may be substantially parallel. The formation may include additional planar vertical pyrolysis zones that may be substantially parallel to each other. Hot fluids may be provided into vertical planar regions such that in situ pyrolysis of heavy hydrocarbons may occur. Pyrolyzation fluids may be removed by production wells disposed in the vertical planar regions.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{653065=N2 2004 exiting the separator may be utilized in heat exchanger 2006 to condense higher molecular weight hydrocarbons from pyrolysis stream 2008 to remove lower molecular weight hydrocarbons from the gas phase into a liquid oil phase. Upgraded gas stream 2010 containing a higher composition of lower molecular weight hydrocarbons than stream 2008 and liquid stream 2012, which includes condensed hydrocarbons, may exit heat exchanger 2006., 416376=Support member 564 and lead-in conductor 572 may be coupled to wellhead 590 at surface 550 of formation 516. Surface conductor 545 may enclose cement 544 and may couple to wellhead 590. Embodiments of heater source surface conductor 545 may have a diameter of about 10.16 cm to about 30.48 cm or, for example, a diameter of about 22 cm. Embodiments of surface casings may extend to depths of approximately 3 m to approximately 515 m into an opening in the formation. Alternatively, the surface casing may extend to a depth of approximately 9 m into the opening. Electrical current may be supplied from a power source to insulated conductor heater 562 to generate heat due to the electrical resistance of conductor 575 as illustrated in FIG. 16. As an example, a voltage of about 330 volts and a current of about 266 amps are supplied to insulated conductors 562 to generate a heat of about 1150 watts/meter in insulated conductor heater 562. Heat generated from the three insulated conductor heaters 562 may transfer (e.g., by radiation) within opening 514 to heat at least a portion of the formation 516., 726651=Surface facilities 2800 may also include processing unit 2821. Processing unit 2821 may be configured to separate stream 2818 into a number of streams. Each of the number of streams may be rich in a predetermined component or a predetermined number of compounds. For example, processing unit 2821 may separate stream 2818 into first portion 2820 of stream 2818, second portion 2823 of stream 2818, third portion 2825 of stream 2818, and fourth portion 2831 of stream 2818. First portion 2820 of stream 2818 may include lighter hydrocarbon components such as methane and ethane. The surface facilities may be configured such that first portion 2820 of stream 2818 may flow from gas treatment unit 2810 to power generation unit 2822., 659463=High temperature heat source 2218 may generally refer to a heat source, or heater, configured to provide heat to selected pyrolyzation section 2202 of formation 2200 substantially adjacent to the heat source 2218. The provided heat may be configured to heat selected pyrolyzation section 2202 to an average temperature within a pyrolization temperature range of the heavy hydrocarbons contained within formation 2200. The pyrolization temperature range may be between about 270\ufffd C. to about 400\ufffd C. A selected pyrolization temperature may be about 300\ufffd C. The pyrolization temperature may vary, however, depending on formation characteristics, composition, pressure, and/or a desired quality of a product produced from formation 2200. A quality of the product may be determined based upon properties of the product, (e.g., the API gravity of the product). Pyrolyzation may include cracking of the heavy hydrocarbons into hydrocarbon fragments and/or lighter hydrocarbons. Pyrolyzation of the heavy hydrocarbons tends to upgrade the quality of the heavy hydrocarbons., 736540=Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that hydrocarbon condensate stream 2806 may flow through a conduit from well head 2802 to hydrotreating unit 2834. Hydrotreating unit 2834 may be configured to hydrogenate hydrocarbon condensate stream 2806 to form hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream 2836. The hydrotreater may be configured to upgrade and swell the hydrocarbon condensate. For example, surface facilities 2800 may also be configured to provide stream 2832 (which includes a relatively high concentration of hydrogen) to hydrotreating unit 2834. In this manner, H2 in stream 2832 may hydrogenate a double bond of the hydrocarbon condensate, thereby reducing a potential for polymerization of the hydrocarbon condensate. In addition, hydrogen may also neutralize radicals in the hydrocarbon condensate. In this manner, the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate may include relatively short chain hydrocarbon fluids. Furthermore, hydrotreating unit 2834 may be configured to reduce sulfur, nitrogen, and aromatic hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon condensate stream 2806. Hydrotreating unit 2834 may be a deep hydrotreating unit or a mild hydrotreating unit. An appropriate hydrotreating unit may vary depending on, for example, a composition of stream 2832, a composition of the hydrocarbon condensate stream, and/or a selected composition of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream., 730070=Surface facilities 2800 may also be configured such that third portion 2825 of stream 2818 may be provided to local market 2829. The local market may include a consumer market or a commercial market. In this manner, the third portion 2825 of stream 2818 may be used as an end product or an intermediate product depending on, for example, a composition of the LPG. For example, LPG may be used in applications, such as food processing, aerosol propellants, and automotive fuel. LPG may usually be available in one or two forms for standard heating and cooking purposes: commercial propane and commercial butane. Propane may be more versatile for general use than butane because, for example, propane has a lower boiling point than butane., 671537=Production well 2210 may also be further configured as described in any of the embodiments herein. For example, production well 2210 may include a valve configured to alter, maintain, and/or control a pressure of at least a portion of the formation., 905003=Computer simulations have demonstrated that carbon dioxide may be sequestered in both a deep coal formation and a post treatment coal formation. The Comet2 Simulator determined the amount of carbon dioxide that could be sequestered in a San Juan Basin type deep coal formation and a post treatment coal formation. The simulator also determined the amount of methane produced from the San Juan Basin type deep coal formation due to carbon dioxide injection. The model employed for both the deep coal formation and the post treatment coal formation was a 1.3 km2 area, with a repeating 5 spot well pattern. The 5 spot well pattern included four injection wells arranged in a square and one production well at the center of the square. The properties of the San Juan Basin and the post treatment coal formations are shown in Table 8. Additional details of simulations of carbon dioxide sequestration in deep coal formations and comparisons with field test results may be found in Pilot Test Demonstrates How Carbon Dioxide Enhances Coal Bed Methane Recovery, Lanny Schoeling and Michael McGovern, Petroleum Technology Digest, September 2000, p. 14-15., 403624=A splice 567 may be required to withstand 1000 VAC at 480\ufffd C. Splice material may be high temperature splices made by Idaho Laboratories Corporation or by Pyrotenax Cable Company. A splice may be an internal type of splice or an external splice. An internal splice is typically made without welds on the sheath of the insulated conductor heater. The lack of weld on the sheath may avoid potential weak spots (mechanical and/or electrical) on the insulated cable heater. An external splice is a weld made to couple sheaths of two insulated conductor heaters together. An external splice may need to be leak tested prior to insertion of the insulated cable heater into a formation. Laser welds or orbital TIG (tungsten inert gas) welds may be used to form external splices. An additional strain relief assembly may be placed around an external splice to improve the splice's resistance to bending and to protect the external splice against partial or total parting., 668096=High temperature heat source 2218 may be disposed in production well 2210. High temperature heat source 2218 may be configured as described in any of the above embodiments. Heat provided by high temperature heat source 2218 may substantially pyrolyze a portion of the mobilized fluids within a selected pyrolyzation section proximate to production well 2210. The pyrolyzation and/or mobilized fluids may be removed from layers 2201 by production well 2210. High temperature heat source 2218 may further upgrade the removed formation fluids within production well 2210. The removed formation fluids may be removed as a vapor through production well 2210. A pressure at or near production well 2210 may be less than about 70 bars absolute. By not heating the entire formation to pyrolyzation temperatures, the process may produce a substantially higher ratio of energy produced versus energy input for the in situ conversion process. Upgrading of the formation fluids at or near production well 2210 may produce a substantially higher value product., 677085=In addition, heat may be provided within production well 2302 to vaporize the removed formation fluids. Heat may also be provided within production well 2302 to pyrolyze and/or upgrade the removed formation fluids as described in any of the embodiments herein., 738090=Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream 2836 may flow from hydrotreating unit 2834 to transportation unit 2838. Transportation unit 2838 may be configured to collect a volume of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate and/or to transport the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate to market center 2840. For example, market center 2840 may include, but may not be limited to, a consumer marketplace or a commercial marketplace. A commercial marketplace may include, but may not be limited to, a refinery. In this manner, the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate may be used as an end product or an intermediate product depending on, for example, a composition of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate., 645260=In one embodiment, the H2 to N2 ratio of the feed stream provided to the ammonia synthesis process may be approximately 3:1. In other embodiments, the ratio may range from approximately 2.8:1 to 3.2:1. An ammonia synthesis feed stream having a selected H2 to N2 ratio may be obtained by blending feed streams produced from different portions of the formation., 724849=Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that gas stream 2804 may flow through a conduit from well head 2802 to gas treatment unit 2810. The conduit may include a pipe or any other fluid communication mechanism known in the art. The gas treatment unit may be configured to separate various components of gas stream 2804. For example, the gas treatment unit may be configured to separate gas stream 2804 into carbon dioxide stream 2812, hydrogen sulfide stream 2814, hydrogen stream 2816, and stream 2818 that may include, but may not be limited to, methane, ethane, propane, butanes (including n-butane or iso-butane), pentane, ethene, propene, butene, pentene, water or combinations thereof., 729182=Third portion 2825 of stream 2818 may include liquefied petroleum gas (\u201cLPG\u201d). Major constituents of LPG may include hydrocarbon containing three or four carbon atoms such as propane and butane. Butane may include n-butane or iso-butane. LPG may also include relatively small concentrations of other hydrocarbons such as ethene, propene, butene, and pentene. Depending on the source of LPG and how it has been produced, however, LPG may also include additional components. LPG may be a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal ambient temperatures. LPG may be liquefied, however, when moderate pressure is applied or when the temperature is sufficiently reduced. When such moderate pressure is released, LPG gas may have about 250 times a volume of LPG liquid. Therefore, large amounts of energy may be stored and transported compactly as LPG., 216530=Certain embodiments may include providing heat from one or more heat sources to heat the formation to a temperature sufficient to allow synthesis gas generation (e.g., in a range of approximately 400\ufffd C. to approximately 1200\ufffd C. or higher). At a lower end of the temperature range, generated synthesis gas may have a high hydrogen (H2) to carbon monoxide (CO) ratio. At an upper end of the temperature range, generated synthesis gas may include mostly H2 and CO in lower ratios (e.g., approximately a 1:1 ratio)., 725650=Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that the carbon dioxide stream may flow through a conduit to a formation, to a containment system, to a disposal unit, and/or to another processing unit. In addition, the facilities may be configured such that the hydrogen sulfide stream may also flow through a conduit to a containment system and/or to another processing unit. For example, the hydrogen sulfide stream may be converted into elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit. The gas treatment unit may also be configured to separate gas stream 2804 into stream 2819 that may include heavier hydrocarbon components from gas stream 2804. Heavier hydrocarbon components may include, for example, hydrocarbons having a carbon number of greater than about 5. Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that heavier hydrocarbon components in stream 2819 may be provided to liquid hydrocarbon condensate stream 2806., 635332=Fischer-Tropsch plant 1096 may produce wax feed stream 1102. The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process that produces wax feed stream 1102 is an exothermic process. Steam 1104 may be generated during the Fischer-Tropsch process. Steam 1104 may be used as a portion of synthesis gas generating fluid 1092., 727555=Power generation unit 2822 may be configured for extracting useable energy from the first portion of stream 2818. For example, stream 2818 may be produced under pressure. In this manner, power generation unit 2822 may include a turbine configured to generate electricity from the first portion of stream 2818. The power generation unit may also include, for example, a molten carbonate fuel cell, a solid oxide fuel cell, or other type of fuel cell. The facilities may be further configured such that the extracted useable energy may be provided to user 2824. User 2824 may include, for example, surface facilities 2800, a heat source disposed within a formation, and/or a consumer of useable energy., 678558=Production well 2302 may also be further configured as described in any of the embodiments herein. For example, production well 2302 may include a valve configured to alter, maintain, and/or control a pressure of at least a portion of the formation., 680954=It is to be understood a geometrical pattern of heat sources 2400 and production wells 2402 is described herein by example. A pattern of heat sources 2400 and production wells 2402 may vary depending on, for example, the type of relatively permeable formation configured to be treated. For example, a pattern of heat sources 2400 and production wells 2402 may include a pattern as described in any of the embodiments herein. In addition, a location of a production well 2402 within a pattern of heat sources 2400 may be determined by, for example, a desired heating rate of the relatively permeable formation, a heating rate of the heat sources, a type of heat source, a type of relatively permeable formation, a composition of the relatively permeable formation, a viscosity of the relatively permeable formation, and/or a desired production rate., 918548=The simulation modeled a sequestration process over a time period of about 3800 days for the post treatment coal formation model. The simulation modeled removal of water from the post treatment coal formation with production from all five wells. During about the first 200 days, the production rate of water was about 680,000 standard m3/day. From about 200-3300 days the water production rate was between about 210,000 to about 480,000 standard m3/day. Production rate of water was negligible after about 3300 days. Carbon dioxide injection was started at approximately 370 days at a flow rate of about 113,000 standard m3/day. The injection rate of carbon dioxide was increased to about 226,000 standard m3/day at approximately 1440 days. The injection rate remained at 226,000 standard m3/day until the end of the simulated injection., 658237=Low temperature heat sources 2216 and high temperature heat sources 2218 may be disposed in production well 2210. Low temperature heat sources 2216 and high temperature heat sources 2218 may be configured as described herein. Production well 2210 may be configured as described herein. Low temperature heat source 2216 may generally refer to a heat source, or heater, configured to provide heat to a selected mobilization section of formation 2200 substantially adjacent to the low temperature heat source. The provided heat may be configured to heat some or all of the selected mobilization section to an average temperature within a mobilization temperature range of the heavy hydrocarbons contained within formation 2200. The mobilization temperature range may be between about 75\ufffd C. to about 150\ufffd C. A selected mobilization temperature may be about 100\ufffd C. The mobilization temperature may vary, however, depending on a viscosity of the heavy hydrocarbons contained within formation 2200. For example, a higher mobilization temperature may be required to mobilize a higher viscosity fluid within formation 2200., 662026=Production wells 2210 may be configured to remove pyrolyzation fluids and/or mobilized fluids from selected pyrolyzation section 2202. Formation fluids may be removed as a vapor. The formation fluids may be further upgraded by high temperature heat source 2218 and low temperature heat source 2216 in production well 2210. Production well 2210 may be further configured to control pressure in selected pyrolyzation section 2202 to provide a pressure gradient so that mobilized fluids flow into selected pyrolyzation section 2202 from the selected mobilization section. In some embodiments, pressure in selected pyrolyzation section 2202 may be controlled to in turn control the flow of the mobilized fluids into selected pyrolyzation section 2202. By not heating the entire formation to pyrolyzation temperatures, the drainage process may produce a substantially higher ratio of energy produced versus energy input for the in situ conversion process., 219807=Certain embodiments may include monitoring a composition of the produced synthesis gas, and then controlling heating and/or controlling input of the synthesis gas generating fluid to maintain the composition of the produced synthesis gas within a desired range. For example, in some embodiments (e.g., such as when the synthesis gas will be used as a feedstock for a Fischer-Tropsch process) a desired composition of the produced synthesis gas may have a ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide of about 1.8:1 to 2.2:1 (e.g., about 2:1 or about 2.1:1). In some embodiments (such as when the synthesis gas will be used as a feedstock to make methanol) such ratio may be about 3:1 (e.g., about 2.8:1 to 3.2:1)., 734732=Membrane 2856 may remove H2 from a reaction stream within a reaction zone of a hydrogen manufacturing unit 2828. When H2 is removed from the reaction stream, reactions within the reaction zone may generate additional H2. A vacuum may draw H2 from an annular region between membrane 2856 and wall 2862 of oxidant line 2852. Alternately, H2 may be removed from the annular region in a carrier gas. Membrane 2856 may separate H2 from other components within the reaction stream. The other components may include, but are not limited to, reaction products, fuel, water, and hydrogen sulfide. The membrane may be a hydrogen-permeable and hydrogen selective material such as, but not limited to, a ceramic, carbon, metal, or combination thereof. The membrane may include, but is not limited to, metals of group VIII, V, III, or I such as palladium, platinum, nickel, silver, tantalum, vanadium, yttrium, and/or niobium. The membrane may be supported on a porous substrate such as alumina. The support may separate the membrane 2856 from catalyst 2854. The separation distance and insulation properties of the support may help to maintain the membrane within a desired temperature range. In this manner, hydrogen manufacturing unit 2828 may be configured to produce hydrogen-rich stream 2830 from the second portion stream 2818. The surface facilities may also be configured such that hydrogen-rich stream 2830 may flow into hydrogen stream 2816 to form stream 2832. In this manner, stream 2832 may include a larger volume of hydrogen than either hydrogen-rich stream 2830 or hydrogen stream 2816., 733692=Catalyst 2854 may be located in the reaction zone to allow reactions that produce H2 to proceed at relatively low temperatures. Without a catalyst and without membrane separation of H2, a steam reformation reaction may need to be conducted in a series of reactors with temperatures for a shift reaction occurring in excess of 980\ufffd C. With a catalyst and with separation of H2 from the reaction stream, the reaction may occur at temperatures within a range from about 300\ufffd C. to about 600\ufffd C., or within a range from about 400\ufffd C. to about 500\ufffd C. Catalyst 2854 may be any steam reforming catalyst. In selected embodiments, catalyst 2854 is a group VIII transition metal, such as nickel. The catalyst may be supported on porous substrate 2864. The substrate may include group III or group IV elements, such as, but not limited to, aluminum, silicon, titanium, or zirconium. In an embodiment, the substrate is alumina (Al2O3)., 631841=Alternatively, in one embodiment, pyrolysis fluids 1066 produced from the formation may be fed to reformer 1068 that produces carbon dioxide stream 1082 and H2 stream 1070. For example, the reformer may include a flameless distributed combustor for a core, and a membrane. The membrane may allow only H2 to pass through the membrane resulting in separation of the H2 and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide may be routed to sequestration area 1080., 738926=Alternatively, surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream 2836 may flow to a splitter or an ethene production unit. The splitter may be configured to separate the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream into a hydrocarbon stream including components having carbon numbers of 5 or 6, a naphtha stream, a kerosene stream, and a diesel stream. Streams exiting the splitter may be fed to the ethene production unit. In addition, the hydrocarbon condensate stream and the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream may be fed to the ethene production unit. Ethene produced by the ethene production unit may be fed to a petrochemical complex to produce base and industrial chemicals and polymers. Alternatively, the streams exiting the splitter may be fed to a hydrogen conversion unit. A recycle stream may be configured to flow from the hydrogen conversion unit to the splitter. The hydrocarbon stream exiting the splitter and the naphtha stream may be fed to a mogas production unit. The kerosene stream and the diesel stream may be distributed as product., 669928=In another embodiment, pyrolyzation of the heavy hydrocarbons may be increased by replacing low temperature heat source 2216 with high temperature heat source 2218 within injection well 2220. High temperature heat source 2218 may provide for substantially more pyrolyzation of the heavy hydrocarbons within layers 2201 than low temperature heat source 2216. The formation fluids removed through production well 2210 may be substantially upgraded as compared to the formation fluids removed in a process using low temperature heat source 2216 within injection well 2220 as described in the embodiment shown in FIG. 46., 663985=In an embodiment, pressurizing fluid 2214 may be provided to formation 2200 through a conduit disposed in/or proximate to production well 2210. The conduit may be configured to provide pressurizing fluid 2214 into formation 2200 proximate to upper impermeable layer 2204., 711284=As in other embodiments, it may be desirable to create pyrolysis zones and low viscosity zones sequentially. Heat sources 2705 nearest production well 2701 may be activated first, for example, heat sources 2705 in ring 2702. A substantially uniform temperature pyrolysis zone may be established after a period of time. Fluids that flow through the pyrolysis zone may undergo pyrolysis and vaporization. Once the pyrolysis zone is established, heat sources 2705 in the low viscosity zone substantially near the pyrolysis zone (e.g., heat sources 2705 in ring 2703) may be activated to provide heat to a portion of a low viscosity zone. Fluid may flow inward towards production well 2701 due to a pressure differential between the low viscosity zone and the pyrolysis zone, as indicated by the arrows. A larger low viscosity zone may be developed by repeatedly activating heat sources farther away from the fracture, for example, heat sources 2705 in ring 2704., 633929=A hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio for synthesis gas used as a feed gas for a Fischer-Tropsch reaction may be about 2:1. In certain embodiments the ratio may range from approximately 1.8:1 to 2.2:1. Higher or lower ratios may be accommodated by certain Fischer-Tropsch systems., 728344=Second portion 2823 of stream 2818 may also include light hydrocarbon components. For example, second portion 2823 of stream 2818 may include, but may not be limited to, methane and ethane. Surface facilities 2800 may also be configured such that second portion 2823 of stream 2818 may be provided to natural gas grid 2827. Alternatively, surface facilities may also be configured such that second portion 2823 of stream 2818 may be provided to a local market. The local market may include a consumer market or a commercial market. In this manner, the second portion 2823 of stream 2818 may be used as an end product or an intermediate product depending on, for example, a composition of the light hydrocarbon components., 417633=An appropriate configuration of an insulated conductor heater may be determined by optimizing a material cost of the heater based on a length of heater, a power required per meter of conductor, and a desired operating voltage. In addition, an operating current and voltage may be chosen to optimize the cost of input electrical energy in conjunction with a material cost of the insulated conductor heaters. For example, as input electrical energy increases, the cost of materials needed to withstand the higher voltage may also increase. The insulated conductor heaters may be configured to generate a radiant heat of approximately 650 watts/meter of conductor to approximately 1650 watts/meter of conductor. The insulated conductor heater may operate at a temperature between approximately 530\ufffd C. and approximately 760\ufffd C. within a formation., 950912=A three-dimensional (3-D) simulation model was used to simulate an in situ conversion process for a tar sand formation. A heat injection rate was calculated using a separate numerical code (CFX; AEA Technology, Oxfordshire, UK). The heat injection rate was calculated at 500 watts per foot (1640 watts per meter). The 3-D simulation was based on a dilation-recompaction model for tar sands. A target zone thickness of 50 meters was used. Input data for the simulation were based on average reservoir properties of the Grosmont formation in northern Alberta, Canada as follows:, 631332=The synthesis gas produced by the reformer may include any of the components described above, such as methane. The produced synthesis gas 1070 may be fed to fuel cell 1072. A portion of electricity 1074 produced by the fuel cell may be sent to a power grid. In addition, a portion of electricity 1076 may be used to power electric heater 1064. Carbon dioxide 1078 exiting the fuel cell may be routed to sequestration area 1080., 663079=In addition, pressure in relatively permeable formation 2200 may be controlled to produce a desired quality of formation fluids. For example, the pressure in relatively permeable formation 2200 may be increased to produce formation fluids with an increased API gravity as compared to formation fluids produced at a lower pressure. Increasing the pressure in relatively permeable formation 2200 may increase a hydrogen partial pressure in mobilized and/or pyrolyzation fluids. The increased hydrogen partial pressure in mobilized and/or pyrolyzation fluids may reduce heavy hydrocarbons in mobilized and/or pyrolyzation fluids. Reducing the heavy hydrocarbons may produce lighter, more valuable hydrocarbons. An API gravity of the hydrogenated heavy hydrocarbons may be substantially higher than an API gravity of the un-hydrogenated heavy hydrocarbons., 459882=Elongated members 600 may be configured to generate heat of approximately 650 watts per meter of elongated members 600 to approximately 1650 watts per meter of elongated members 600. In this manner, elongated members 600 may be at a temperature of approximately 480\ufffd C. to approximately 815\ufffd C. Substantially uniform heating of a hydrocarbon containing formation may be provided along a length of elongated members 600 greater than about 305 m or, maybe, greater than about 610 m. A length of elongated members 600 may vary, however, depending on, for example, a type of hydrocarbon containing formation, a depth of an opening in the formation, and/or a length of the formation desired for treating., 664331=In another embodiment, low temperature heat source 2216 may be turned down and/or off in production wells 2210. The heavy hydrocarbons in formation 2200 may be mobilized by transfer of heat from selected pyrolyzation section 2202 into an adjacent portion of formation 2200. Heat transfer from selected pyrolyzation section 2202 may be substantially by conduction., 651235=Ammonia feed stream 1180 may be fed to ammonia production facility 1182 to produce ammonia 1184. Carbon dioxide 1186 exiting the gas separation unit 1178 (and/or carbon dioxide from other sources) may be fed, with ammonia 1184, into urea production facility 1188 to produce urea 1190., 405726=There are a number of companies that manufacture insulated conductor heaters. Such manufacturers include, but are not limited to, MI Cable Technologies (Calgary, Alberta), Pyrotenax Cable Company (Trenton, Ontario), Idaho Laboratories Corporation (Idaho Falls, Id.), and Watlow (St. Louis, Mo.). As an example, an insulated conductor heater may be ordered from Idaho Laboratories as cable model 355-A90-310-\u201cH\u201d 30\u2032/750\u2032/30\u2032 with Inconel 600 sheath for the cold-pins, three phase Y configuration and bottom jointed conductors. The required specification for the heater should also include 1000 VAC, 1400\ufffd F. quality cable in addition to the preferred mode specifications described above. The designator 355 specifies the cable OD (0.355\u2033), A90 specifies the conductor material, 310 specifies the heated zone sheath alloy (SS 310), \u201cH\u201d specifies the MgO mix, 30\u2032/750\u2032/30\u2032 specifies about a 230 m heated zone with cold-pins top and bottom having about 9 m lengths. A similar part number with the same specification using high temperature Standard purity MgO cable may be ordered from Pyrotenax Cable Company., 400035=An insulated conductor heater may be tested after fabrication. The insulated conductor heater may be required to withstand 2-3 times an operating voltage at a selected operating temperature. Also, selected samples of produced insulated conductor heaters may be required to withstand 1000 VAC at 760\ufffd C. for one month., 449292=In another embodiment, a second conductor may be disposed in a second conduit, and a third conductor may be disposed in a third conduit. The second opening may be different from the opening for the first conduit. The third opening may be different from the opening for the first conduit and the second opening. For example, each of the first, second, and third openings may be disposed in substantially different well locations of the formation and may have substantially similar dimensions. The first, second, and third conductors may be configured as described herein. The first, second, and third conductors may be electrically coupled in a 3-phase Y electrical configuration. The outer conduits may be connected together or may be connected to the ground. The 3-phase Y electrical configuration may provide a safer, more efficient method to heat a hydrocarbon containing formation than using a single conductor. The first, second, and/or third conduits may be electrically isolated from the first, second, and third conductors, respectively. Dimensions of each conductor and each conduit may be configured such that each conductor may generate heat of approximately 650 watts per meter of conductor to approximately 1650 watts per meter of conductor. In an embodiment, a first conductor and a second conductor in a conduit may be coupled by a flexible connecting cable. The bottom of the first and second conductor may be enlarged to create low resistance sections, and thus generate less heat. In this manner, the flexible connector may be made of, for example, stranded copper covered with rubber insulation., 494395=In some embodiments, a power (Pwr) required to generate a heating rate (h) in a selected volume (V) of a hydrocarbon containing formation may be determined by the following equation: Pwr=h*V*CV*\u03c1B. In this equation, an average heat capacity of the hydrocarbon containing formation may be described as CV. The average heat capacity of the hydrocarbon containing formation may be a relatively constant value. Average heat capacity may be estimated or determined using one or more samples taken from a hydrocarbon containing formation, or measured in situ using a thermal pulse test. Methods of determining average heat capacity based on a thermal pulse test are described by I. Berchenko, E. Detournay, N. Chandler, J. Martino, and E. Kozak, \u201cIn-situ measurement of some thermoporoelastic parameters of a granite\u201d in Poromechanics, A Tribute to Maurice A. Biot, pages 545-550, Rotterdam, 1998 (Balkema), which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 390538=In some embodiments, the electrical insulation 576 may inhibit current leakage and may inhibit arcing to the sheath 577. The electrical insulation 576 may also thermally conduct heat generated in the conductor 575 to the sheath 577. The sheath 577 may radiate or conduct heat to the formation. An insulated conductor heater 562 may be 1000 m or more in length. In an embodiment of an insulated conductor heater, the insulated conductor heater 562 may have a length from about 15 m to about 950 m. Longer or shorter insulated conductors may also be used to meet specific application needs. In embodiments of insulated conductor heaters, purchased insulated conductor heaters have lengths of about 100 m to 500 m (e.g., 230 m). In certain embodiments, dimensions of sheaths and/or conductors of an insulated conductor may be formed so that the insulated conductors have enough strength to be self supporting even at upper working temperatures. Such insulated cables may be suspended from wellheads or supports positioned near an interface between an overburden and a hydrocarbon containing formation without the need for support members extending into the hydrocarbon formation along with the insulated conductors., 678132=In addition, pressure in relatively permeable formation 2200 may be controlled such that a production rate of formation fluids may be controlled. The pressure in relatively permeable formation 2200 may be controlled through, for example, production well 2302, heat sources 2300, and/or a pressure control well disposed in relatively permeable formation 2200., 404627=An insulated conductor assembly may include heating sections, cold pins, splices, and termination canisters and flexible transition conductors. The insulated conductor assembly may need to be examined and electrically tested before installation of the assembly into an opening in a formation. The assembly may need to be examined for competent welds and to make sure that there are no holes in the sheath anywhere along the whole heater (including the heated section, the cold-pins, the splices and the termination cans). Periodic X-ray spot checking of the commercial product may need to be made. The whole cable may be immersed in water prior to electrical testing. Electrical testing of the assembly may need to show more than 2000 megaohms at 500 VAC at room temperature after water immersion. In addition, the assembly may need to be connected to 1000 VAC and show less than about 10 microamps per meter of resistive leakage current at room temperature. Also, a check on leakage current at about 760\ufffd C. may need to show less than about 0.4 milliamps per meter., 163066=This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/199,215 entitled \u201cIn Situ Energy Recovery,\u201d filed Apr. 24, 2000, U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/199,214 entitled \u201cIn Situ Energy Recovery From Coal,\u201d filed Apr. 24, 2000, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/199,213 entitled \u201cEmissionless Energy Recovery From Coal,\u201d filed Apr. 24, 2000. The above-referenced provisional applications are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 723963=Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that water stream 2808 may flow from well head 2802 to a portion of a formation, to a containment system, or to a processing unit. For example, water stream 2808 may flow from well head 2802 to an ammonia production unit. The surface facilities may be configured such that ammonia produced in the ammonia production unit may flow to an ammonium sulfate unit. The ammonium sulfate unit may be configured to combine the ammonia with H2SO4 or SO2/SO3 to produce ammonium sulfate. In addition, the surface facilities may be configured such that ammonia produced in the ammonia production unit may flow to a urea production unit. The urea production unit may be configured to combine carbon dioxide with the ammonia to produce urea., 913172=The simulation modeled a sequestration process over a time period of about 3700 days for the deep coal formation model. Removal of the water in the coal formation was simulated by production from all five wells. The production rate of water was about 40 m3/day for about the first 370 days. The production rate of water decreased significantly after the first 370 days. It continued to decrease through the remainder of the simulation run to about zero at the end. Carbon dioxide injection was started at approximately 370 days at a flow rate of about 113,000 standard (in this context \u201cstandard\u201d means 1 atmosphere pressure and 15.5 degrees Celsius) m3/day. The injection rate of carbon dioxide was doubled to about 226,000 standard m3/day at approximately 1440 days. The injection rate remained at about 226,000 standard m3/day until the end of the simulation run., 649652=The amount of N2 in the enriched air may be adjusted to provide a N:H ratio of about 3:1 for ammonia production. It may be desirable to generate synthesis gas at a temperature that may favor the production of carbon dioxide over carbon monoxide. It may be advantageous for the temperature of the formation to be between about 400\ufffd C. and about 550\ufffd C. In another embodiment, it may be desirable for the temperature of the formation to be between about 400\ufffd C. and about 450\ufffd C. Synthesis gas produced at such low temperatures may be substantially composed of N2 H2, and carbon dioxide with little carbon monoxide., 653599=Oxygen 2014 from cryogenic separation unit 2002 and steam 2016, or water, may be fed into hot carbon containing formation 2018 to produce synthesis gas 2020 in a continuous process as described herein. It is desirable to generate synthesis gas at a temperature that favors the formation of carbon dioxide over carbon monoxide. It may be advantageous for the temperature of the formation to be between about 400\ufffd C. and about 550\ufffd C. In another embodiment, it may be desirable for the temperature of the formation to be between about 400\ufffd C. and about 450\ufffd C. Synthesis gas 2020 may be substantially composed of H2 and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide may be removed from synthesis gas 2020 to prepare a feed stream for ammonia production using amine gas separation unit 2022. H2 stream 2024 from the gas separation unit and N2 stream 2026 from the heat exchanger may be fed into ammonia production facility 2028 to produce ammonia 2030. Carbon dioxide 2032 exiting the gas separation unit and ammonia 2030 may be fed into urea production facility 2034 to produce urea 2036., 433638=In an embodiment, heat may be generated in or by conduit 582. In this manner, about 10% to about 30%, or, for example, about 20% of the total heat generated by the heater may be generated in or by conduit 582. Both conductor 580 and conduit 582 may be made of stainless steel. Dimensions of conductor 580 and conduit 582 may be chosen such that the conductor will dissipate heat in a range from approximately 650 watts per meter to 1650 watts per meter. A temperature in conduit 582 may be approximately 480\ufffd C. to approximately 815\ufffd C. and a temperature in conductor 580 may be approximately 500\ufffd C. to 840\ufffd C. Substantially uniform heating of a hydrocarbon containing formation may be provided along a length of conduit 582 greater than about 300 m or, maybe, greater than about 600 m. A length of conduit 582 may vary, however, depending on, for example, a type of hydrocarbon containing formation, a depth of an opening in the formation, and/or a length of the formation desired for treating., 733055=Fuel line 2850 may be concentrically positioned within oxidant line 2852. Critical flow orifices within fuel line 2850 may be configured to allow fuel to enter into a reaction zone in annular space 2859 between the fuel line and oxidant line 2852. The fuel line may carry a mixture of water and vaporized hydrocarbons such as, but not limited to, methane, ethane, propane, butane, methanol, ethanol, or combinations thereof. The oxidant line may carry an oxidant such as, but not limited to, air, oxygen enriched air, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or combinations thereof., 353471=After the portion of the formation reaches a temperature sufficient to support oxidation, an oxidizing fluid may be provided into the opening to oxidize at least a portion of the hydrocarbons at a reaction zone, or a heat source zone, within the formation. Oxidation of the hydrocarbons will generate heat at the reaction zone. The generated heat will in most embodiments transfer from the reaction zone to a pyrolysis zone in the formation. In certain embodiments the generated heat will transfer at a rate between about 650 watts per meter as measured along a depth of the reaction zone, and/or 1650 watts per meter as measured along a depth of the reaction zone. Upon oxidation of at least some of the hydrocarbons in the formation, energy supplied to the heater for initially heating may be reduced or may be turned off. As such, energy input costs may be significantly reduced, thereby providing a significantly more efficient system for heating the formation., 669267=In another embodiment, high temperature heat source 2218 may be replaced with low temperature heat source 2216 within production well 2210. Low temperature heat source 2216 may provide for substantially less pyrolyzation of the heavy hydrocarbons within layers 2201 than high temperature heat source 2218. Therefore, the formation fluids removed through production well 2210 may not be as substantially upgraded as formation fluids removed through production well 2210 with high temperature heat source 2218, as described for the embodiment shown in FIG. 46., 674956=Heat sources 2300 may provide heat to substantially mobilize a portion of the heavy hydrocarbons within relatively permeable formation 2200. The mobilized fluids may flow towards a bottom of relatively permeable formation 2200 substantially by gravity. The mobilized fluids may be removed through production well 2302. Each of heat sources 2300 disposed at or near the bottom of relatively permeable formation 2200 may be configured to heat some or all of a section proximate the bottom of formation 2200 to a temperature sufficient to pyrolyze heavy hydrocarbons within the section. Such a section may be referred to as a selected pyrolyzation section. A temperature within the selected pyrolyzation section may be between about 270\ufffd C. and about 400\ufffd C. and may be configured as described in any of the embodiments herein. Pyrolysis of the heavy hydrocarbons within the selected pyrolyzation section may convert at least a portion of the heavy hydrocarbons into pyrolyzation fluids. The pyrolyzation fluids may be removed through production well 2302. Production well 2302 may be disposed within the selected pyrolyzation section. In some embodiments, one or more of heat sources 2300 may be turned down and/or off after substantially mobilizing the majority of the heavy hydrocarbons within relatively permeable formation 2200. Doing so may more efficiently heat the formation and/or may save on input energy costs associated with the in situ process. Also, heating during \u201coff peak\u201d times may be cheaper., 677392=A pressurizing fluid may be provided into relatively permeable formation 2200 through heat sources 2300. The pressurizing fluid may increase the flow of the mobilized fluids towards production well 2302. For example, increasing the pressure of the pressurizing fluid proximate heat sources 2300 will tend to increase the flow of the mobilized fluids towards production well 2302. The pressurizing fluid may include, but may not be limited to, N2, CO2, CH4, H2, steam, and/or mixtures thereof. Alternatively, the pressurizing fluid may be provided through an injection well disposed in relatively permeable formation 2200., 707714=Plane 2648 and plane 2649 may include heat sources that may provide heat sufficient to create a pyrolysis zone between plane 2648 and plane 2649. Plane 2651 and plane 2652 may include heat sources that create a pyrolysis zone between plane 2651 and plane 2652. Heat sources in regions 2650, 2660, 2655, and 2656 may provide heat that may create low viscosity zones. Mobilized fluids in regions 2650, 2660, 2655, and 2656 may tend to flow in a direction toward the closest fracture in the formation. Mobilized fluids entering the pyrolysis zone may be pyrolyzed. Pyrolyzation fluids may be produced from production wells 2640., 744983=In certain embodiments, a triangular pattern of heat sources may provide advantages when compared to alternative patterns of heat sources, such as squares, hexagons, and hexagons with additional heaters installed halfway between the hexagon corners (12 to 1 pattern). Squares, hexagons, and the 12:1 patterns are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,923,535 and/or in U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,118. For example, a triangular pattern of heat sources may provide more uniform heating of a hydrocarbon containing formation resulting from a more uniform temperature distribution of an area of a formation heated by the pattern of heat sources., 743550=The total number of heat sources is determined from adding the heat sources counted by, (a) 4, (b) 8/2=4, and (c)4/4=1, for a total number of 9 heat sources 3000 in unit cell 3012 Therefore, a ratio of heat sources 3000 to production wells 3002 is determined as 9:1 for the pattern illustrated in FIG. 74., 761015=Numerical calculations have been made for a natural distributed combustor system configured to heat a hydrocarbon containing formation. A commercially available program called PRO-II was used to make example calculations based on a conduit of diameter 6.03 cm with a wall thickness of 0.39 cm. The conduit was disposed in an opening in the formation with a diameter of 14.4 cm. The conduit had critical flow orifices of 1.27 mm diameter spaced 183 cm apart. The conduit was configured to heat a formation of 91.4 meters thick. A flow rate of air was 1.70 standard cubic meters per minute through the critical flow orifices. A pressure of air at the inlet of the conduit was 7 bars absolute. Exhaust gases had a pressure of 3.3 bars absolute. A heating output of 1066 watts per meter was used. A temperature in the opening was set at 760\ufffd C. The calculations determined a minimal pressure drop within the conduit of about 0.023 bar. The pressure drop within the opening was less than 0.0013 bar., 676574=In an embodiment, production well 2302 may remain closed until a temperature sufficient to pyrolyze at least a portion of the heavy hydrocarbons in the selected pyrolyzation section may be reached. Doing so may inhibit production of substantial amounts of unfavorable heavy hydrocarbons from relatively permeable formation 2200. Production of substantial amounts of heavy hydrocarbons may require expensive equipment and/or reduce the life of production equipment., 349253=The total number of heat sources 400 in unit cell 404 may include six full heat sources 400 a that are each counted as one heat source, and six partial heat sources 400 b that are each counted as one half of a heat source. Therefore, a ratio of heat sources 400 to production wells 402 in unit cell 404 may be determined as 9:1. A ratio of heat sources to production wells may vary, however, depending on, for example, the desired heating rate of the hydrocarbon containing formation, the heating rate of the heat sources, the type of heat source, the type of hydrocarbon containing formation, the composition of hydrocarbon containing formation, the desired composition of the produced fluid, and/or the desired production rate. Providing more heat sources wells per unit area will allow faster heating of the selected portion and thus hastening the onset of production, however more heat sources will generally cost more money to install. An appropriate ratio of heat sources to production wells may also include ratios greater than about 5:1, and ratios greater than about 7:1. In some embodiments an appropriate ratio of heat sources to production wells may be about 10:1, 20:1, 50:1 or greater. If larger ratios are used, then project costs tend to decrease since less wells and equipment are needed., 583147=Removal of hydrocarbons due to treating at least a portion of a hydrocarbon containing formation, as described in any of the above embodiments, may also occur on a microscopic scale. Hydrocarbons may be removed from micropores within the portion due to heating. Micropores may be generally defined as pores having a cross-sectional dimension of less than about 1000 \u212b. In this manner, removal of solid hydrocarbons may result in a substantially uniform increase in porosity within at least a selected section of the heated portion. Heating the portion of a hydrocarbon containing formation, as described in any of the above embodiments, may substantially uniformly increase a porosity of a selected section within the heated portion. In the context of this patent \u201csubstantially uniform porosity\u201d means that the assessed (e.g., calculated or estimated) porosity of any selected portion in the formation does not vary by more than about 25% from the assessed average porosity of such selected portion., 635706=Wax feed stream 1102 produced from Fischer-Tropsch plant 1096 may be sent to hydrocracker 1106. The hydrocracker may produce product stream 1108. The product stream may include diesel, jet fuel, and/or naphtha products. Examples of methods for conversion of synthesis gas to hydrocarbons in a Fischer-Tropsch process are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,096,163 to Chang et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,085,512 to Agee et al., and U.S. Pat No. 6,172,124 to Wolflick et al., which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 646844=In certain embodiments, enriched air 1170 is blended from air and oxygen streams such that the nitrogen to hydrogen ratio in the produced synthesis gas is about 1:3. The synthesis gas may be at a correct ratio of nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia. For example, it has been calculated that for a formation temperature of 700\ufffd C., a pressure of 3 bar absolute, and with 13,231 tons/day of char that will be converted into synthesis gas, one could inject 14.7 kilotons/day of air, 6.2 kilotons/day of oxygen, and 21.2 kilotons/day of steam. This would result in production of 2 billion cubic feet/day of synthesis gas including 5689 tons/day of steam, 16,778 tons/day of carbon monoxide, 1406 tons/day of hydrogen, 18,689 tons/day of carbon dioxide, 1258 tons/day of methane, and 11,398 tons/day of nitrogen. After a shift reaction (to shift the carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, and to produce additional hydrogen), the carbon dioxide may be removed, the product stream may be methanated (to remove residual carbon monoxide), and then one can theoretically produce 13,840 tons/day of ammonia and 1258 tons/day of methane. This calculation includes the products produced from Reactions (4) and (5) above.}",

It is believed that higher quality liquids were produced because more hydrogenation occurred in the drum during the high pressure experiment (although the hydrogen concentration in the gas was less in the high pressure experiment, the drum pressures were significantly greater, and therefore the partial pressure of hydrogen in the drum was greater in the high pressure experiment).
