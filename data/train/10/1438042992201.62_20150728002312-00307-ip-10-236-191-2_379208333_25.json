Reliable messages are retransmitted rapidly if the message is lost.

For refresh reduction to be used between two routers, it must be enabled on both routers.

Available bandwidth from all configured bandwidth pools is advertised using IGP. RSVP signals the TE tunnel with appropriate bandwidth pool requirements. Perform this task to confirm DiffServ-TE bandwidth. Confirming DiffServ-TE Bandwidth Configuring an IETF DS-TE Tunnel Using MAM Configuring an IETF DS-TE Tunnel Using RDM Configuring a Prestandard DS-TE Tunnel Related Tasks For prestandard DS-TE you do not need to configure bandwidth for the data channel or the control channel. There is no other specific RSVP configuration required for this application. When no RSVP bandwidth is specified for a particular interface, you can specify zero bandwidth in the LSP setup if it is configured under RSVP interface configuration mode or MPLS-TE",
