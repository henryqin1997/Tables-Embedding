Sample size was determined based on the insulin glargine study objective. Results reported below are those of the insulin glargine study. Significant events and approaches for the overall study following participant enrollment, but prior to group assignment Pre-Assignment Details This study was conducted at 575 sites in 40 countries between August 22, 2003 and December 19, 2011. Three sites were closed and data from these sites were not analyzed following site audits and in compliance with rulings from national health authorities.
