Serum insulin levels were determined with an Insulin ELISA Test Kit (Kit # DSL-10-1600 from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc., Webster, Tex.), modifying the standard protocol in order to optimize the sensitivity and linear range of the standard curve for the volumes and concentrations of the samples used in the present protocol. Serum human insulin concentrations (\u03bcU/ml) were measured for each time point for each of the five animals in each dosing group. The five values for each time point were averaged and the results plotted as serum insulin concentration versus time. (Previous experiments revealed no measurable levels of human insulin following oral dosing with human insulin alone.) The maximum (peak) and the area under the curve (AUC) are reported below in Table 8., 227943=2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone (5.00 g, 0.0329 mol), benzyl bromide (3.72 ml, 0.031 mol), potassium carbonate (4.31 g, 0.031 mol) and acetone (150 ml) were added to a 500 ml round bottom flask. The reaction mixture was heated overnight at reflux and then was cooled to ambient temperature. When cool, deionized water (150 ml) was added to the reaction mixture and the reaction mixture was extracted three times with 100 ml portions of diethyl ether. The combined ether layers were dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo yielding a dark solid. This dark solid was recrystallized from 50:50 (ethanol:water) yielding 3.09 g of 2-hydroxy-5-benzyloxyacetophenone as yellow needles., 141145=A preferred active agent is daptomycin. Daptomycin is described by Baltz in Biotechnology of Antibiotics, 2nd Ed., ed. W. R. Strohl (New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc.), 1997, pp. 415\u2013435. Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that can be derived from the fermentation of Streptomyces roseosporus. Daptomycin is a member of the factor A-21978CO type antibiotics of S. roseosporus and comprises a n-decanoyl side chain linked via a three-amino acid chain to the N-terminal tryptophan of a cyclic 10-amino acid peptide. The compound is currently being developed in a variety of formulations to treat serious infections caused by bacteria, including, but not limited to, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). Methods for synthesizing daptomycin are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. Re. 32,333; Re. 32,455; 5,800,157, 4,885,243; Re. 32,310; Re. 32,311; 4,537,717; 4,482,487 and U.S. Pat.

After the reactor was heated at 50\ufffd C. overnight, the reactor was opened and an additional 0.5 g of 10% palladium on activated carbon was added. The reactor was again sealed, evacuated and charged with hydrogen. When no change in the reaction mixture had occurred after two days at ambient temperature, the reactor was again opened and the reaction mixture was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and the residue was placed in the Parr reactor once again. The residue was then taken up in ethyl acetate, and 10% palladium on activated carbon was added. The reactor was sealed, evacuated, charged with hydrogen and heated overnight at 50\ufffd C. After cooling to ambient temperature, the reactor was opened, the palladium on activated carbon was filtered off, and the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting yellow solid was recrystallized from 80:20 water:ethyl alcohol. The yellow solid resulting from this recrystallization was taken up in boiling hexane. Ethyl acetate was then added until a clear solution was achieved, and the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. A tan solid, which precipitated, was isolated by filtration and dried in vacuo. 6.23 g of (4-hydroxy-2-acetylphenyl)-8-oxyoctanoic acid was recovered.

The mixture was sparged for 15 minutes with nitrogen before 10% palladium on activated carbon was added to the reaction mixture. The flask was then evacuated, and a balloon containing hydrogen was placed atop the flask such that the contents of the flask were kept under a hydrogen atmosphere. The mixture was allowed to stir overnight at room temperature, and was then filtered through Celite. Ethyl alcohol was removed in vacuo, yielding a white solid which was first recrystallized from 90:10 ethyl alcohol:water and then was dissolved in 2N aqueous sodium hydroxide. The mixture was filtered and acidified with 2N aqueous hydrochloric acid. The resulting white solid was isolated by filtration and allowed to dry under vacuum. 2.12 g of the (4-hydroxyphenyl)-8-oxyoctanoic acid was isolated.

The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at ambient temperature. Deionized water was added and the reaction mixture was heated at reflux for five hours. At the end of this period, the reaction mixture was allowed to come to room temperature, and was acidified with a 2N aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. The resulting tan solid was isolated by filtration and was washed two times with portions of deionized water. After drying overnight in vacuo, 16.75 g of the (4-benzyloxy-2-acetylphenyl)-8-oxyoctanoic acid was recovered., 193669=The clear orange solution was cooled to 0\ufffd C. in an ice bath, then acidified with concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid until a solid formed (pH=7).

The resulting mixture was stirred for 10 minutes, after which time 5.49 g (30.8 mmol) of methyl 2-hydroxycinnamate and 7.81 g (31.1 mmol) of ethyl 8-bromooctanoate were added. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for about five hours, after which time 50 mL of distilled water were added. The yellow solution was stirred at room temperature overnight, then washed with 2 80 mL portions of ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was cooled to 0\ufffd C. Concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid was added until the pH of the solution was about 5. The resulting solid was collected by filtration and recrystallized from 50:50 (ethanol:water) to give 4.31 g (45.7%) of a white powder. Melting point: 148\u2013150\ufffd C. Combustion analysis: % C: 66.65 (calc'd), 66.59 (found); % H: 7.24 (calc'd), 7.24 (found). 1H NMR Analysis: (300 MHz, d6-DMSO): \u03b4 12.0, broad s, 2H; \u03b4 7.86, s; 7.81, s, 1H; 7.67\u20137.63, dd, 1H; 7.39\u20137.33, dt, 1H; 7.07\u20137.04, d, 1H; 6.98\u20136.93, t, 1H; 6.55, s; 6.50, s, 1H; 4.04, t, 2H; 2.19, t, 2H; 1.76, p, 2H; 1.50, m, 2H; 1.43\u20131.28, m, 6H., 204860=Preparation of O-acetyl-N-ethylsalicylamide. The N-ethylsalicylamide (7.93 g, 0.0481 mol), produced above, and methylene chloride (100 ml) were placed in a round bottom flask fitted with nitrogen purge, addition funnel and magnetic stir bar. This solution was cooled in an ice water bath and then triethylamine (14.71 ml, 0.1057 mol) was added. Acetyl chloride (3.76 g, 0.0529 mol) was placed into the addition funnel and slow dropwise addition over approximately 10 minutes was made to the reaction mixture. After 1 hour the ice water bath was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to come to room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was then diluted with dichloromethane (100 ml) and was extracted first with 100 ml of 2N aqueous hydrochloric acid and then with two 100-ml portions of deionized water. The methylene chloride layer was then dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The resulting oil was then purified by elution through a silica gel column. A mixture of 60:40 hexane:ethyl acetate was used as the eluent, and 75 ml fractions were collected.

The two phases were separated and the organic layer extracted with 3N NaOH solution (3\ufffd150 ml). The organic layer was again extracted once with satd. NaCl solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The organic solution was then reduced to half volume (\u02dc180 mL) and topped with an equal amount of hexane. This was placed in a refrigerator overnight. The crystals that formed were vacuum filtered and allowed to air dry. The product was not further analyzed and was used \u201cas is\u201d in the following steps., 234150=Airless techniques were used during the transfer of liquids. 10.0 grams of 8-(4-benzyloxy-phenoxy) octanoic acid, ethyl ester (0.02699 mol., 1 eq.) was added to a flame dried 250 mL 3-necked round-bottomed flask containing a stirbar. To this was added 100 mL of anhydrous THF. The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes or until the solid was completely dissolved. The mixture was cooled to \u221278\ufffd C. using a dry ice and acetone bath. To the mixture was added 24.0 mL of a 2 M lithium diisopropylamide solution (0.0480 mol., 1.7 eq.).

Serum insulin concentrations (\u03bcU/ml) were measured for each time point for each of the five animals in each dosing group. The five values for each time point were averaged and the results plotted as serum insulin concentration versus time. The ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) for the test group versus that of the control group is reported below. The ratio of the maximum serum insulin concentration (Cmax) for the test group versus that of the control group is also reported below., 217665=O-acetyl,N-methyl salicylamide (17.74 g, 0.919 mol), which was prepared as described above, was placed in a one liter round bottom flask with dimethylformamide (300 ml). The flask was cooled in an ice/water bath and sodium hydride (3.38 g, 0.1406 mol) was added. Methyl 8-bromodecanoate (36.54 g, 0.1379 mol) was dissolved in an additional portion of dimethylformamide (100 ml) and this solution was added dropwise to the reaction mixture over a period of 25 minutes.

After stirring overnight at room temperature, an additional portion of potassium hydroxide (2.62 g, 0.0467 mol) was added to the mixture in an effort to get the reaction to go to completion. After stirring for an additional 5.5 hours, water (200 ml) was added to the mixture, which was then extracted with three portions of dichloromethane (100 ml portions). The combined dichloromethane portions were dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting brown oil was noted to have an odor of dimethyl sulfoxide and was taken up in water. This mixture was then extracted with three portions of ethyl acetate (100 ml portions). The combined ethyl acetate layers were then washed with three portions of water (100 ml portions). The ethyl acetate layer was dried with sodium sulfate and was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting brown oil was taken up in an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (2N, 100 ml). Tetrahydrofuran (50 ml) was then added and the mixture was heated to reflux for 2 hours before heating was discontinued. Tetrahydrofuran was removed in vacuo, and the reaction mixture was acidified with 2N aqueous hydrochloric acid. The resulting tan solid was washed several times in 40\u201350\ufffd C. water, and then was recrystallized from 80:20 (water:ethanol). The resulting tan solid was recrystallized first from 90:10 (hexane:ethyl acetate) and then was added to boiling water. Ethyl alcohol was added until the mixture cleared. Upon cooling a tan solid precipitated and was isolated by filtration. This product was allowed to dry in vacuo and was isolated in a yield of 5.96 g. Compound 43 analytical data: Melting point=89\u201391\ufffd C. Combustion Analysis: % C: 66.67 (calc'd), 66.68 (found) % H: 7.94 (calc'd), 7.92 (found). 1H NMR Analysis: (d6-DMSO): \u03b4 12.0, s, 1H; 9.3, s, 1H; 7.00, t, 1H; 6.29, m, 3H; 3.84, t, 2H; 2.15, t, 2H; 1.62, p, 2H; 1.45, p, 2H; 1.23, m, 6H., 215853=Carsalam (30.00 g, 0.1840 mol), iodomethane (10.23 ml, 0.1643 mol), sodium carbonate (19.51 g, 0.1840 mol) and dimethylformamide (150 ml) were placed in a 500 ml round bottom flask. The reaction mixture was heated overnight at 80\ufffd C. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered and a white solid collected. This was washed with water and the remaining solid placed into a 250 ml round bottom flask. Water was added to the filtrate from the initial filtration and more, white solid precipitated. This material was combined with the solid already in the 250 ml flask and 2N aqueous sodium hydroxide (150 ml) was added. The mixture was heated for one hour before heating was discontinued and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool overnight. Overnight, a white solid precipitated and was isolated by filtration and allowed to dry in vacuo. 21.52 g of N-methylsalicylamide was isolated.}",
