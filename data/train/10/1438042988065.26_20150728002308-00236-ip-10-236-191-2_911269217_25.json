But we added a dialog API to core on the expectation that it would be ready by code freeze. Scott Gonzalez hangs out in #drupal-contribute and might be able to provide more details on the jQuery UI roadmap, etc. Interesting. Yeah, we definitely do want to display these in a different theme than the front-end theme... it should use the theme defined as the admin theme (see #10). That actually makes a fairly reasonable case as to why we might need both Overlay and Dialog API in core, though making them both match visually (since users obviously won't know when they're viewing one vs. the other) will be very hard, I fear. Though I suppose you could also say the pop-up in #10 is just the front-end theme's own styling of dialogs. Hm. Wonder how",

These are indeed degrading the experience, and Bartik buttons are not that different from Seven buttons, so there are not really that big of a difference. Views popups would only show up above admin pages (unlike contextual links which are supposed to show up above the front end theme).
