To prove that the seal is hermetic, a thin layer of calcium film (0.5 microns thick) is deposited on one of the 1737 glass substrates prior to sealing. If the calcium film is not protected, it will react with the moisture in the ambient and loses its metallic appearance in 2-3 hours. The sealed samples are placed in an 85\u00b0 C./85RH chamber to accelerate diffusion of water molecules through the seal. There was no change in the appearance of the calcium film even after aging 700 hours in 85\u00b0 C./85RH environment., 39377=The present application is a continuation-in-part application under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 of commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/414,653 filed on Apr. 16, 2003, now abandoned and entitled \u201cHermetically Sealed Glass Package and Method of Fabrication.\u201d The present application is also related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/965,453, entitled \u201cHermetically Sealed Glass Package and Method of Fabrication,\u201d filed concurrently. The disclosures of these applications are specifically incorporated herein by reference., 143334=The sealing glass (e.g., layer 102) can be drawn into a micro-sheet (typically approximately 0.05 mm to approximately 0.15 mm in thickness). As can be appreciated, the entire sheet is not needed. Rather, the sheet is diced or cut into portions, and these portions are laid over the substrate (e.g., first substrate 101) perimetrically. For example, the portions of the sheet may be provided as shown in FIG. 1, with the portions comprising the sealing layer 102. Alternatively, a sealing layer may be an integral element, which is cut-out of the microsheet into a desired shape. For example, the integral element may be cut into a nearly rectangular shape to form the sealing layer 102. Thereafter, another substrate (e.g., substrate 201) is disposed over the first substrate. As described previously, the first and second substrates are 1737 glass substrates (one with OLEDs and the other is a cover glass with nearly matching thermal expansion)., 59242=In example embodiments related to displays and optical devices, the substrate 101 may be at least partially transparent, depending on the viewing surface chosen. Of course, this is not essential. However, it is beneficial for the material chosen for the substrate to be substantially non-absorbing at an emission wavelength of a laser or over emission wavelength ranges of lasers used to effect the sealing by heating the sealing layer 102. Illustratively, the substrate 101 may comprise a borosilicate glass material. For example, in applications such as OLED display packages, the substrate 101 may be a transparent glass plate such as that manufactured and sold by Corning Incorporated under the brand names of Code 1737 glass or Eagle 2000\u2122 glass. Alternatively, the substrate plate 101 may be a transparent glass plate such as those manufactured and sold by the companies such as Asahi Glass Co. (e.g., OA10 glass and OA21 glass), Nippon Electric Glass Co., NHTechno and Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., 142898=In the foregoing discussion related to TABLES 3-5, 1737 or Eagle glass was used as the transparent substrate. However, it should be noted that if another glass, with better UV transparency, was used as the transparent substrate, then one could use a laser wavelength in the transparency region of that substrate glass. For example, if high purity fused silica was used then a 266 nm laser could be used to seal the plates., 148449=\u00a9 2004-2015 FreePatentsOnline.com. All rights reserved.

    "textBeforeTable": "In Table 1 below, illustrative sealing materials (columns 1-6) have a different type, or concentration, or both of oxides such as Fe2O3, PbO, CuO, ZnO, and SrO. It is noted that some of these elements are not transitional and some of these elements were not added to induce absorption. The sealing glass materials in these embodiments have an enhanced optical absorption in the near-infrared region and in particular at a wavelength of approximately 810 nm wavelength. Thus, the selection of transition-metal dopants is based on the glass absorption at the laser wavelength that is illustratively approximately 810 nm. In addition, the substrate is of a material that does not significantly absorb light having a wavelength of approximately 810 nm. In",
