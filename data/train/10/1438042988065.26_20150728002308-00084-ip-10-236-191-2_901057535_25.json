            "Food is not that great at Los Angeles Pierce College. It has a mini Cafe where students can get the basic drinks, and a few actual foods such as pizza, bagels, sandwiches, and hot wings. If it had fast food restaurants, it would be awesome! There are couple restaurants not far from the school students go to because of the poor food and dining; if not that, students simple bring their own lunch",
            "There is no Dorms available at Pierce College; therefore living with the parents and or living with a friend(s) will be the choice to go with. I think that dorms at Pierce College would be a great thing to have; maybe students will study more and feel that they have a purpose since they will be close to school.",
            "This issue is everywhere; some students do well in school while other tend not to. I believe it is the students responsibility to do well if they want to succeed. As of reviews, I have noticed Los Angeles Pierce College has pretty high rates on transferring rates; therefore, academic rigor should be a plus!",
            "As any student entering a college or university, they should be aware that it is up to the student to keep tract of their schedules at all times. Nobody will be pushing you to get good grades like counselors at high schools do. Self motivation will be the number one tip for a student entering college.",
            "Los Angeles Pierce College is an amazing school filled with friendly and dedicated professors who will go beyond to give their students the education they need. This School also has counselors, health offices, and what not for all students who need that extra boost. Although Pierce College can use some remodeling for bigger class rooms, this school is perfect for any student who wants to achieve in life."
