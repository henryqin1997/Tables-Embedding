When the -stdout qualifier is used, the user will still be prompted for all the info that is required, but will write to standard output by default. The user will also still be prompted for an output filename, in case the user wants to save the output to a file. When the -options qualifier is used and not all the parameters are given on the command line, it will query the user for those parameters. It will not only query the user for the required parameters as it would do without the -options qualifier, but it will also query the user for the optional parameters. The example shows the application seqret being run with the -filter qualifier. The input file is 'piped' into the program using the unix command cat and the output is 'piped' directly to the unix program lpr, which will print it on the printer. % cat sequence.seq | seqret -filter | lpr   Example:   The filter qualifier makes the program behave like a filter, reading its (first) input 'file' from the standard input, and writing its (first) output 'file' to the standard output. The -filter qualifier will also invoke the -auto qualifier, so the user is never prompted for any missing",

Comments Fasta output format Question When i tried to convert the EMBL format file into fasta format using the program \" seqret\", I found that the Access.no appears twice...  >AF102796 AF102796 Homo sapiens alphaE-catenin (CTNNA1) gene, exon 11. Answer \"It is not a bug ... it is a feature\" There are many \"FASTA formats\". EMBOSS uses the format that ACEDB and the EBI genome projects use. The first field after the ID is the accession number, so that accession numbers can be kept when sequences are converted to FASTA format, without using the NCBI format (with '|' characters in the IDs). Your EMBL format file has IDs that look like accession numbers, so EMBOSS fills in the accession number for each sequence, and reports it in the FASTA format.",
