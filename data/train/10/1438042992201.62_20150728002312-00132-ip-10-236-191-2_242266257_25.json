In addition it provides better detection, handling and reporting of cases where the control variable is KILL\u2019d within the scope of the FOR. Note that NOUNDEF, which treats undefined values as the empty string, does not apply to missing FOR control variables when they are incremented, as that would tend to create apparently unintended indefinite loops. For example FOR A=1:1:10 KILL A gives an UNDEF error on the increment from 1 to 2 even in NOUNDEF mode. In V5.4-002 the most troublesome constructs gave a FORCTRLINDX error; prior to that they could produce unreliable results including segmentation violation (UNIX SIG-11 and OpenVMS ACCVIO). In addition, when the control variable disappeared in the scope of the FOR, the UNDEF message sometimes did not contain the name of the variable. (C9L03-003392), 90872=S9K08-002783, 91113=S9K10-002786, 158420=M-profiling more accurately reports time for large M programs with extensive routine invocations and tracks nested invocations as long as GT.M has available stack. In V5.4-002A, M-profiling over-reported time and, upon exceeding 1024 levels of nesting, aggregated all further time in one special entry. Note that the M-profiling changes in V5.4-002A were still more representative of relative time spent than in earlier versions.

    "textBeforeTable": "As of the publication date, FIS supports this release on the following hardware and operating system versions. Contact FIS for a current list of supported platforms. Over time, computing platforms evolve. Vendors obsolete hardware architectures. New versions of operating systems replace old ones. We at FIS continually evaluate platforms and versions of platforms that should be Supported for GT.M. In the table below, we document not only the ones that are currently Supported for this release, but also alert you to our future plans given the evolution of computing platforms. If you are an FIS customer, and these plans would cause you hardship, please contact your FIS account executive promptly to discuss your needs. Platforms V5.4-002 contains numerous fixes, remedied mis-features, and smaller enhancements. For a comprehensive list, refer to Change History. Please refer to the description of C9K09-003324 for changes to the configure script used to install GT.M. A new option generates code to evaluate elements of Boolean expressions in an alternative order that ensures expresion components with side effects evluated before the Boolena evaluation as an alternative to GT.M's default behavior which stops the evaluation of Boolean expressions once the final outcome is determined. An \"unlink all\" capability for UNIX platforms allows a process to disassociate itself from all routines that it has linked, release memory, and continue execution with a new entryref at the top of the",
    "textAfterTable": "Migrating to 64-bit platforms The same application code runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. Please note that: You must compile the application code separately for each platform. Even though the M source code is exactly the same, the generated object modules are different even on the same hardware architecture - the object cde differs between x86 and x86_64. Parameter-types that interface GT.M with non-M code using C calling conventions must match the data-types on their target platforms. Mostly, these parameters are for call-ins, external calls, internationalization (collation), and environment translation and are listed in the tables below. Note that most addresses on 64-bit platforms are 8 bytes long and require 8 byte alignment in structures whereas all addresses on 32-bit platforms are 4 bytes long and require 4-byte alignment in structures.
