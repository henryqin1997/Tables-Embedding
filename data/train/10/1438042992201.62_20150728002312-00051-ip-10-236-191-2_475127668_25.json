No. 6,288,012, which application(s) are incorporated herein by reference., 82382=31.0 g of sodium bicarbonate and 31.0 g of citric acid were added to a 2-liter PET bottle (manufactured by Plastipak) containing 1850 g of chilled water and the bottle was capped immediately. The charged bottle was then rinsed with DI water and set on clear paper towel overnight., 35997=Specific examples of useful lubricants include oleic acid, corn oil, mineral oils available from Vulcan Oil and Chemical Products sold under the \u201cBacchus\u201d trademark; fluorinated oils and fluorinated greases, available under the trademark \u201cKrytox\u201d from is DuPont Chemicals. Also useful are siloxane fluids available from General Electric silicones, such as SF96-5 and SF 1147 and synthetic oils and their mixture with PTFE available under the trademark \u201cSuper Lube\u201d from Synco Chemical. Also, high performance PTFE lubricant products from Shamrock, such as nanoFLON M020\u2122, FluoroSLIP\u2122 225 and Neptune\u2122 5031 and polyalkylene glycols from Union Carbide such as UCON\u2122 LB625, and Carbowax\u2122 materials are useful., 76764=These examples demonstrated that the mixture of oleic acid and Krytox GPL100 possesses mild steel-on-stainless steel and PET-on-stainless steel lubricities, which are better than the commercially available aqueous based lube. The ratio of oleic acid to Krytox GPL100 is about 1:1 by weight. The rotating disk was stainless steel.}",

Accordingly this disclosure should not be read as being limited to the foregoing examples or preferred embodiments. Coeficient of friction (COF) measured on a short track conveyor system: The determination of lubricity of the lubricant was measured on a short track conveyor system. The conveyor was equipped with two belts from Rexnord. The belt was Rexnord LF (polyacetal) thermoplastic belt of 3.25\u2033 width and 20 ft long. The lubricant was applied to the conveyor surface evenly with a bottle wash brush. The conveyor system was run at a speed of 100 ft/min. Six 2 L bottles filled with beverage were stacked in a rack on the track with a total weight of 16.15 kg. The rack was connected to a strain gauge by a wire. As the belts moved, force was exerted on the strain gauge by the pulling action of the rack on the wire. A computer recorded the pull strength. The coefficient of friction (COF) was calculated on the basis of the measured force and the mass of the bottles and it was averaged from the beginning to the end of the run. The results of the testing of example 25 are shown in a graphical form in FIG. 1. Conveyor surface: 2 \ufffd 3.25\u2033 \ufffd 20 ft = 6.5\u2033 \ufffd 2012",
