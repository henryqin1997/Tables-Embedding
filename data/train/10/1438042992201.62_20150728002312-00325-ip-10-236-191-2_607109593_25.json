This is not the promised seven hours by Fujitsu but this scenario is not really realistic anyway. Surfing via WLAN or watching a DVD are more realistic - then the runtime is 4:02 hours and 3:33 hours respectively before the battery has to be recharged. With maximum load it runs out of juice little after an hour. So how about the competition?}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Overall most of the latest games are playable on the Fujitsu Lifebook N532 with reduced details and a reduced resolution. However, it is not really future-proof, so if you want to play browser or casual games in the future you should consider a more powerful device. In fact our review unit performs worse in all games compared to competitors with the same graphics but higher clocks. For better comparison we tested the same games that we used in the Acer Aspire E1-571G review. We can see a 20% performance disadvantage of the Lifebook N532 because of the reduced clock. And the competition? The HP ProBook 4740s is on the same level and the Asus K75VJ is far ahead in many games thanks to the more powerful GPU (GeForce GT 635M). Gaming should be possible with the GeForce GT620M graphics, yet it will not be sufficient for the native display resolution and high details in many games. The reduced clock is another factor.
