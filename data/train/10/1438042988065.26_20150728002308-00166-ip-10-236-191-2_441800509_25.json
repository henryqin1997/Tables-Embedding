            "Description",
            "Therapeutic/diagnostic external airway position support (EAPS) device and method - A hands free, external airway position support device for use on a patient undergoing a surgical, therapeutic and/or diagnostic procedure. The device adheres to the patient at the base of his or her chin, jaw or neck so that no wrap around neck or head sling attachment means are required. When installed, the device will extend the patient's neck and maneuver his or her chin upward and outward, away from the base of the neck. As this device will be relatively inexpensive to manufacture and not overly complicated, it can be disposed of after use rather than requiring sterilization for reuse.",
            "Apparatus and Method For Visually Determining Whether Respiration is Occurring - What is presented is an apparatus for visually determining whether respiration is occurring comprising a strip of material having a first side and a second side in which the first side has a layer of thermally sensitive material which undergoes a color change when exposed to a temperature variance caused by a subject's respiration. The thermally sensitive material could be a thermochromic liquid crystal compound. The second side could have a layer of adhesive which could be used to adhere the strip of material in the vicinity of the subject's upper lip. The strip of material could also be adhered to a visible surface of a respiratory assistance device with the adhesive.",

Derrick, West Mifflin, PA US 09-24-2009 Retinal rest device and method - A hands free, support device for use on a patient convalescing from ophthalmologic surgery such as the type used to reattach a detached retina. The device can be repeatedly positioned between the base of a user/wearer's chin/jaw and upper chest so that no wrap around neck or head sling attachment means are required. When installed, the device will keep the user/wearer's chin tilted downward and toward the upper chest. A related method is also disclosed. 20090235937 Published Description Patent application number Steve J. Derrick, West Miffin, PA US 03-25-2010 Ultrasonic system and method for affixing a screen sub-assembly to a plate - In one embodiment of the present invention, a method of affixing a screen sub-assembly to a substrate includes the steps of depositing a thermoplastic material on a surface of the substrate and placing the screen sub-assembly on top of the substrate. The screen sub-assembly includes a screen element and a thermoplastic material. The method also includes the steps of placing the screen sub-assembly and the substrate on a movable surface and driving the movable surface across a base support surface so as to position the screen sub-assembly and the substrate below an ultrasonic welding device. The ultrasonic welding device is actuated to emit ultrasonic energy that results in the screen sub-assembly being affixed to the substrate. The substrate can",
