The reaction was stirred for about 30 minutes more at about \u221278\ufffd C., then warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The reaction was quenched with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and the mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were extracted twice with water, brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to give 31 g of crude product.

The mixture was then filtered through a bed of diatomaceous earth. The diatomaceous earth was washed with ethanol (200 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. Purification by silica gel chromatography using 75-100% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent afforded the title compound of part 10-G as a white solid (130 mg, 53%): +APcl MS (M+1)+ 247; 1H NMR=250 MHz (methanol-d4) \u03b4: 7.29 (Ph, m, 5H), 3.78 (s, 1H), 3.35 (s, 2H), 3.22-1.68 (series of m, 8H)., 407715=To a solution of the title compound of part 6-B (77 mg, 0.22 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.15 mL, 0.87 mmol) in dichloromethane (1 mL) was added acetyl chloride (0.031 mL, 0.44 mmol).

G. et al., Acta Endocrinologica (Copenh.) 1989, 121, pp. 177-184). As such, a combination of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof and an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist is useful in the treatment or prevention of frailty associated with aging, congestive heart failure and obesity which comprises administering to a human or another animal, especially dogs, cats and horses, in need of such treatment a combination of an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist and a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, defined above. Preferred alpha-2 adrenergic agonists include clonidine, which is disclosed in U.S. Pat.

No. 3,235,550 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference and medetomidine, which is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,544,664 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In another aspect, this invention provides methods for accelerating bone fracture repair and wound healing, attenuating protein catabolic response after a major operation, and reducing cachexia and protein loss due to chronic illness, which comprise administering to a human or another animal, especially dogs, cats and horses in need of such treatment a combination of an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist such as clonidine, xylazine or medetomidine and a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof. It has been shown that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists cause release of endogenous growth hormone in human and canine subjects (Celia et al., Life Sciences (1984), 34:447-454; Hampshire J, Altszuler N., American Journal of Veterinary Research (1981), 42:6, 1073-1076; Valcavi et al., Clinical Endocrinology (1988), 29:309-316; Morrison et al., American Journal of Veterinary Research (1990), 51:1, 65-70;), and that the co-administration of an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist with growth hormone-releasing factor restores defective growth hormone secretion in aged dogs (Arce et al., Brain Research (1990), 537:359-362; Cella et. al., Neuroendocrinology (1993), 57:432-438)., 59654=The compounds of WO 94/11012 and WO 94/13696 are reported to be useful in the treatment of osteoporosis in combination with parathyroid hormone or a bisphosphonate., 615518=To a solution of the crude amine, the acid of Example 2, Step 1 (96 mg, 0.25 mmol) and Et3N (0.16 mL, 1.2 mmol) in EtOAc (1 mL) at 0\ufffd C. was added PPAA (50% solution in EtOAc, 0.16 mL, 0.27 mmol). After 16 h of stirring at room temperature, the reaction mixture was extracted from saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate with EtOAc, and the combined extracts dried (MgSO4) and concentrated. Purification by silica gel chromatography employing 7:3 EtOAc/hexanes, then EtOAc, then 19:1 EtOAc/MeOH as eluants afforded the less polar isomer of Example 201, Step E (29 mg, 28%), the more polar isomer (41 mg, 40%), as well as some mixed fractions. Less polar isomer of Example 201, Step E: +APcl MS (M+1)+ 607, (M\u2212BOC+1)+ 507; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4: 7.35-6.80 (arom, series of m, 10 H), 4.68 (d, 1H), 4.47 (ABq, 2H), 2.63 (d, 1H), 0.91 (Me, m, 1.5H), 0.63 (Me, d, 1.5H).

The residue was extracted from saturated aqueous NaHCO3 with methylene chloride, the combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated to give the title compound of part 3-D as a light yellow solid (13.7 g, 78%): +APcl MS (M+H)+ 329; 1H NMR=400 MHz (CDCl3) \u03b4: 8.42 (arom, ddd, 1H), 7.55 (arom, td, 1H), 7.37-7.07 (arom, m, 2H); 4.15-3.98 (CF3CH2, m, 2H), 3.87 (NCHHCH2, m, 1H), 3.79 (CCHHNH, d, 1H), 3.40 (CCHHNH, d, 1H), 3.25 (PyrHH, d, 1H), 3.13 (NCHHCH2, ddd, 1H), 3.02 (NCH2CHHNH, dd, 1H), 2.74 (PyrCHH, d, 1H), 2.66 (NCH2CHHNH, td, 1H)., 384833=A stirred solution of piperazine-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid 1-benzyl ester 4-tert-butyl ester 2-methyl ester (200 g, 529 mol), prepared as described by Bigge et al. (Tetrahedron Let. 1989, 30, 5193), in tetrahydrofuran (200 mL) and DMF (1.5 L) was cooled to about \u221278\ufffd C., and a 0.5 M solution of potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in THF (1.27 L) was added. After the above solution had stirred for about one hour, the free base of 2-picolyl chloride was generated by extracting the corresponding hydrochloride salt (217 g, 1.32 mol) from saturated sodium bicarbonate solution with methylene chloride. The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4), concentrated, immediately dissolved in DMF (100 mL), and then added dropwise to the enolate containing solution. The reaction was stirred for about 4 hours at about \u221278\ufffd C., then slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The toluene and THF were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was extracted from water (1.5 L) with ethyl acetate (3\ufffd1 L), the combined extracts were then washed with water (1.5 L), dried (MgSO4) and then concentrated in vacuo to give 240 g of crude product of the title compound of part 3-A which was carried on to the next step: +APcl MS (M+H)+ 470, (M\u2212tBu+H) 436; 1H NMR=400 MHz (methanol-d4), 55881=Hyposecretion of GH in several clinical settings (obesity, aging, glucocorticoid suppression) is relatively resistant to stimulation by GHRH (Gertz, B. J., et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 79:745 (1994); Arvat, E., et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 79:1440 (1994); Maccario, M., et al., Metabolism, 44:134 (1995)). In contrast, administration of a GHRP or combined administration of GHRH and a GHRP in these patients can elicit a robust GH response (Aloi, J. A., et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 79:943; (1994)). Single dose studies of GHRPs have demonstrated the absence of an acute effect on circulating insulin or glucose levels. Insulin and glucose have generally not been monitored in chronic studies except to document the absence of unfavorable changes (Jacks, T., et al., J Endocrinol. 143:399 (1993))., 54941=Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes, and a large fraction of NIDDM patients are obese. Both conditions are characterized by elevated circulating insulin levels and suppressed GH levels. GH treatment of GH-deficient adults (Jorgensen, J. O. L., et al., Lancet 1:1221 (1989)), obese women (Richelsen, B., et al., Am J Physiol, 266:E211 (1994)) and elderly men (Rudman, D., et al, Horm Res 36 (Suppl 1):73 (1991)) has been shown to produce increases in lean body, hepatic and muscle mass while decreasing fat mass. Thus, GH therapy for obesity would seem attractive except for the diabetogenic effects of GH., 437691=To the title compound of part 9-G (125 mg, 0.205 mmol) in anhydrous dichloromethane (1 mL) was added 4 M HCl/dioxane (1 mL), and the reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight.

(J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 656), and LiCl (1.71 g, 40.5 mmol) in THF (30 mL) was cooled to \u221278\ufffd C and n-BuLi was added (13.16 mmol, 5.25 mL of a 2.5 M solution). After stirring for 20 min at \u221278\ufffd C., the reaction was warmed to 0\ufffd C. and stirred an additional 20 minutes. 3-Phenyl-1-bromopropane (1.3 mL, 7.42 mmol) was added and the reaction was stirred for 2 h at 0\ufffd C. Aqueous 1 N HCl (50 mL) and EtOAc (50 mL) were added, the organic phase was separated and extracted with 1 N HCl (50 mL). The aqueous extracts were combined, cooled in an ice bath and slowly basified to pH 14 with 6 N NaOH. The product was extracted with CH2Cl2 (4\ufffd50 mL) and the combined extracts were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated to give a yellow oil. Purification by flash chromatography (SiO2 gel, 92:4:4, CH2Cl2:MeOH:triethylamine) delivered 400 mg (78%) of the Product of Example 199, Step A: +APcl MS (M+1)+ 341; 1H NMR=400 MHz (CDCl3) \u03b4: 7.38 (m, 10H), 5.26 (m, 1H), 4.15 (m, IH), 3.86 (m, 1H), 2.36 (s, 3H)., 452979=According to General Procedure B. the title compound of part 11-E (150 mg, 0.51 mmol) was coupled to the title compound of part 2-I (193 mg, 0.51 mmol), and the product was purified by silica gel chromatography using 50-100% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent to give the title compound of part 11-F (180 mg, 57%): PB MS (M+1)+ 621, (M+18)+ 638; 1H NMR=250 MHz (CDCl3) \u03b4: 7.30-6.90 (arom., series of m, 10H), 1.44 (Me, s, 6H), 1.40 (BOC, s, 9H)., 235320=Rat growth hormone concentrations were determined by double antibody radioimmunoassay using a rat growth hormone reference preparation (NIDDK-rGH-RP-2) and rat growth hormone antiserum raised in monkey (NlDDK-anti-rGH-S5) obtained from Dr. A. Parlow (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrence, Calif.). Additional rat growth hormone (1.5 U/mg, #G2414, Scripps Labs, San Diego, Calif.) is iodinated to a specific activity of approximately 30 \u03bcCi/\u03bcg by the chloramine T method for use as tracer. Immune complexes are obtained by adding goat antiserum to monkey IgG (ICN/Cappel, Aurora, Ohio) plus polyethylene glycol, MW 10,000-20,000 to a final concentration of 4.3%; recovery is accomplished by centrifugation. This assay has a working range of 0.08-2.5 \u03bcg rat growth hormone per tube above basal levels., 241366=Approximately seven months post-surgery, Sham and Ovx rats were weighed and randomly assigned to groups. Rats were dosed daily by oral gavage with 1 mL of either vehicle (1% ethanol in distilled-deionized water), 0.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg of a growth hormone releasing agent for 90 days. Rats were weighed at weekly intervals throughout the study. Twenty-four hours after the last oral dose, the acute response of serum growth hormone (GH) to test agent was assessed by the following procedure. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital 50 mg/kg. Anesthetized rats were weighed and a baseline blood sample (\u02dc100 pl) was collected from the tail vein. Test agent (growth hormone releasing agent or vehicle) was then administered intravenously via the tail vein in 1 mL. Approximately ten minutes after injection, a second 100 \u03bcl blood sample was collected from the tail. Blood was allowed to clot at about 4\ufffd C., then centrifuged at 2000\ufffdg for about 10 minutes. Serum was stored at about \u221270\ufffd C. Serum growth hormone concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay as previously described. Following this procedure, each anesthetized rat underwent whole body scanning by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, Hologic QDR 1000/W, Waltham Mass.). A final blood sample was collected by cardiac puncture into heparinized tubes.

Thus, the administration of the compounds of this invention for purposes of stimulating the release of endogenous growth hormone can have the same effects or uses as growth hormone itself. These varied uses of growth hormone may be summarized as follows: stimulating growth hormone release in elderly humans or companion animals especially dogs, cats, camels and horses; treating growth hormone deficient adult humans or other animals especially dogs, cats, camels and horses; preventing catabolic side effects of glucocorticoids, treating osteoporosis, stimulating the immune system, accelerating wound healing, accelerating bone fracture repair, treating growth retardation, treating congestive heart failure as disclosed in PCT publications WO 95/28173 and WO 95/28174 (an example of a method for assaying growth hormone secretagogues for efficacy in treating congestive heart failure is disclosed in R. Yang et al., Circulation, Vol. 92, No. 2, p.262, 1995), treating acute or chronic renal failure or insufficiency; treating physiological short stature including growth hormone deficient children, treating short stature associated with chronic illness, treating obesity, treating growth retardation associated with Prader-Willi syndrome and Turners syndrome; accelerating the recovery and reducing hospitalization of bum patients or following major surgery such as gastrointestinal surgery; treating intrauterine growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia, hypercortisonism and Cushings syndrome; replacing growth hormone in stressed patients; treating osteochondrodysplasias, Noonans syndrome, sleep disorders, Alzheimers disease, delayed wound healing, and psychosocial deprivation; treating pulmonary dysfunction and ventilator dependency; attenuating protein catabolic response after a major operation; treating malabsorption syndromes, reducing cachexia and protein loss due to chronic illness such as cancer or AIDS; accelerating weight gain and protein accretion in patients on TPN (total parenteral nutrition); treating hyperinsulinemia including nesidioblastosis; adjuvant treatment for ovulation induction and to prevent and treat gastric and duodenal ulcers; stimulating thymic development and preventing age-related decline of thymic function; adjunctive therapy for patients on chronic hemodialysis; treating immunosuppressed patients and enhancing antibody response following vaccination; improving muscle strength, increasing muscle mass, mobility, maintenance of skin thickness, metabolic homeostasis, renal hemeostasis in the frail elderly; stimulating osteoblasts, bone remodeling, and cartilage growth; treating neurological diseases such as peripheral and drug induced neuropathy, Guillian-Barre Syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accidents and demyelinating diseases; and stimulating wool growth in sheep., 223044=This invention is directed to the use of growth hormone secretagogues specifically growth hormone releasing peptides (GHRP) or GHRP mimetics of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof to improve glycemic control. Agents that increase growth hormone (GH) levels would not be expected to have this effect since it is widely recognized that GH is diabetogenic in animals and in humans. In acromegalics, glucose utilization and suppression of hepatic glucose production are impaired (see Hansen, I., et al., Am J Physiol, 250:E269 (1986)). In this disease of GH excess, impaired glucose handling and hyperinsulinemia have been reversed by pituitary surgery or chemotherapy which reduced GH levels (see Levin S. R., et al., Am J Med, 57:526 (1974), Feek, C. M., et al., J Clin Endocrinol 22:532 (1981)). Furthermore, administration of GH to older subjects caused hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia in numerous studies (see Aloia, J. F., et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 43:992 (1976); Binnerts et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 67:1312 (1988); Marcus, R., et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 70:519 (1990)). Therefore, GH therapy is contra-indicated for individuals with diabetes or those at risk for diabetes., 601829=To a solution of 1-benzyl-4-oxo-piperidine-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (5.14 g, 20.8 mmol) in DMF (130 mL) at 0\ufffd C. was added sodium hydride (60% by weight in mineral oil, 0.874 g, 21.8 mmol) in four portions over 0.5 h.

After stirring 18 hours, the sovent was removed under vacuum and was replaced with toluene (15 mL), 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (0.5 mL, 3.3 mmol) was added, and the reaction was heated for 4 hours at 100\ufffd C. The material was extracted from water with EtOAc, and the combined extracts were dried (MgSO4) and concentrated. Purification by silica gel chromatography employing chloroform then 19:1 chloroform/MeOH as eluants afforded the compound of Example 202, Step B (147 mg, 65%): +APcl MS (M+1)+ 330, (M\u2212tBu+l)+ 274; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4: 8.43 (arom, d, 1H), 7.55-6.90 (series of m, 4H), 6.00, (olefin, d, 1H), 3.09 (d, 1H), 1.42 (BOC, s, 9H)., 232706=Compounds that have the ability to stimulate GH secretion from cultured rat pituitary cells are identified using the following protocol. This test is also useful for comparison to standards to determine dosage levels. Cells are isolated from pituitaries of 6-week old male Wistar rats. Following decapitation, the anterior pituitary lobes are removed into cold, sterile Hank's balanced salt solution without calcium or magnesium (HBSS). Tissues are finely minced, then subjected to two cycles of mechanically assisted enzymatic dispersion using 10 U/mL bacterial protease (EC 3.4.24.4, Sigma P-6141, St. Louis, Mo.) in HBSS. The tissue-enzyme mixture is stirred in a spinner flask at 30 rpm in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at about 37\ufffd C. for about 30 min., with manual trituration after about 15 min. and about 30 min. using a 10-mL pipet. This mixture is centrifuged at 200\ufffdg for about 5 min. Horse serum (35% final concentration) is added to the supematant to neutralize excess protease. The pellet is resuspended in fresh protease (10 U/mL), stirred for about 30 min. more under the previous conditions, and manually triturated, ultimately through a 23-gauge needle. Again, horse serum (35% final concentration) is added, then the cells from both digests are combined, pelleted (200\ufffdg for about 15 min.), resuspended in culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM) supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose, 10% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 UmL nystatin and 50 mg/mL gentamycin sulfate, Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y.) and counted. Cells are plated at 6.0-6.5\ufffd104 cells per cm2 in 48-well Costar\u2122 (Cambridge, Mass.) dishes and cultured for 3-4 days in culture medium., 375656=To a solution of the title compound of part 2-B (0.87 g, 2.05 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) was added a 1 M solution of lithium triethylborohydride in tetrahydrofuran (4.1 mL), with immediate effervescence observed. The reaction was stirred for about 30 minutes, after which an additional 0.5 mL of the 1 M solution of lithium triethylborohydride was added. The reaction was then quenched with a 1N HCl solution (0.5 mL). The mixture was stirred for about 5 minutes, then basified with 1N NaOH. The mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were extracted with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to give the title compound of part 2-C as a clear oil (0.80 g, 99%): +APcl MS (M+1)+ 397, (M\u221255)+ 341, (M\u221299)+ 297; 1H NMR=300 MHz (CDCl3) \u03b4: 7.31-7.25 (arom, m, 10H), 1.50 (BOC, s, 9H)., 607399=To a solution of the compound of Example 200, Step E (0.019 g, 0.078 mmol), the acid of Example 2, Step 1 (0.045 g, 0.12 mmol) and Et3N (0.045 mL, 0.31 mmol) in EtOAc (1 mL) at 0\ufffd C. was added PPAA (50% solution in EtOAc, 0.093 mL, 0.16 mmol). After 24 h of stirring at room temperature, additional 2-I (0.015 g, 0.039 mmol) and PPAA (0.045 mL, 0.078 mmol) were added and stirring was continued at room temperature for 24 h. The reaction mixture was partitioned between EtOAc and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, the organic layer was removed and the aqueous layer was washed twice with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. Purification by silica gel chromatography employing EtOAc as the eluant afforded the less polar isomer of Example 200, Step F (0.005 g), as well as a mixture of the two isomers (0.028 g). Example 200, Step F less polar isomer: +APcl MS (M+1)+ 607; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4: 7.03-7.32 (arom, series of m, 10 H), 5.27 (m, 1H), 4.48 (m, 2H), 2.69 (s, 3H), 1.35 (s, 9H)., 439477=To a stirred solution of the title compound of part 7-A (98.1 g, 282 mmol) in ethyl ether/ethyl acetate (800 mL/200 mL) at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere was bubbled in HCl gas for about 30 minutes. The reaction was stirred for about 1 hour, then HCl gas was bubbled in for about an additional 30 minutes and the reaction was stirred for about another 1 hour. HCl gas was bubbled in for about an additional 1 hour, and then the solid product was collected by filtration, rinsed with ethyl ether, and dried in vacuo to give the title compound of part 10-A as a white powder.
