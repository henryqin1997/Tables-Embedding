Privacy Policy Ad Choices Terms of Service, 12904=Brady threw a touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski and Shane Vereen had a rushing touchdown for New England, which endured a most uncharacteristic freefall. The last time the Patriots were outscored by 23 points or more in the second half was Nov. 30, 2008 against Pittsburgh - 94 games ago., 14072=Rookie linebacker Chris McCain had a blocked punt on the game's first series, setting up a Tannehill-to-Lamar Miller touchdown pass - the first time Miami's opening offensive sequence of a season resulted in a TD throw since Dan Marino and Mark Duper connected in 1992., 15546=Helped by a roughing-the-passer penalty and a pair of third-down completions by Tannehill, the Dolphins went 85 yards in about 6 minutes to put the game away. Moreno barged in from the 4 with 3:36 remaining to push the lead to 30-20, and the outcome was academic from there.}",
