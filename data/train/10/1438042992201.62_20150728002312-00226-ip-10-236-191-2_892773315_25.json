    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here My teacher is very laid-back and she is there to help us and make sure we actually UNDERSTAND the material. She has plenty of resources posted to her online website that further illustrate what she teaches in class and helps to make things even more simple for us. The students here are all nice and friendly and willing to help each other which makes Shelton a comfortable learning environment. Am learning a lot At this point, I am only taking one course because I do not qualify for financial aid but I am learning more at faster pace than I ever have. I am taking Math 112-06 (Pre-calculus Algebra) and I am catching on much more quickly and easily than I did to the same material in high school and the new material does not seem as daunting.
