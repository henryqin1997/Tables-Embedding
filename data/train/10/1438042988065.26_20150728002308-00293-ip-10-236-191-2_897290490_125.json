            "Its expensive. I'm not going to lie. I don't know if I'll still be able to go next year, depending on what scholarships I get...",
            "Go to the pool, walk around downtown Savannah with friends. Eat! Do artsy things with artsy people.",
            "They recently remodeled their SCAD Cafe, and it's now called the Hive. The food is AMAZING. Its buffet style, so you pay when you entire, and you can eat til your hearts content! They have everything ranging from pastas, to the salad bar, to fish, to burgers. Everything changes day to day, so always expect something amazing there. They have a fro-yo machine as well, and a bunch of delicious desserts to chose from. It's also vegetarian and vegan friendly. All their meat is cagefree and grass fed beef.",
            "You're basically living in a motel freshman year. You can't keep your dorm room open because if you do that, you're outside then and the heat and bugs come in. Leave your dehumidifier on, ALWAYS, along with the A/C. Dyson and Turner Annex have pools so thats nice. Oh each dorm has their own bathroom so thats really good too. The dorms are spacious and you can fit a ton of stuff in them, might be hard to put things on the walls but most students find ways.",
            "Depends on your classes, but freshman year with the foundation courses, it should be fairly simple. Classes are 2 and a half hour long, so take that into consideration. Teachers then expects hours of work to be put in outside of class and then materials can start adding up to costs over $20 a project...",
            "Look for scholarships. ALWAYS be looking for scholarships, because this school is expensive.",
            "the students are nice there, the teachers are very informative and helpful. The campus is all over the city of Savannah, so getting to places might be difficult if the buses are late."

You will surely flunk out if you slack on your work., 1008370=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 665532=The dorm got broken into and robbed at 6am the first week of the fall quarter in 2012. SCAD tried to cover it up, and none of our parents knew about it. But it was all over the news; unfortunately local news only. And nothing happens to the security guards who are always sleeping. My friend forgot her ID and flashed up a Pokemon card and was allowed access into the dorm., 29011=SCAD is an absolutely amazing school but just make sure you get more scholarships than the ones they provide. The grading there is a B- or B+ is the same as a B and a 3.5 G.P.A. is an average of an A (this is what you'll usually have to maintain to keep the scholarships they give to you. Basically be careful, it's hard to keep your grades in this category and they're sneaky and you don't find out what your grades are really going to have to be before you go there. Again, go to community college first, get the easy stuff over with. I can't imagine getting the things like english and math over while I'm there. It's the quarter system (you have three quarters/semesters in a year (fall quarter goes from September to November, Winter is January to March and Spring is from March to June.)) Everything is really fast paced and intense so you'd be better of going somewhere else first and transferring. SCAD is usually really good about how things transfer and you'll be more likely to get good scholarships that way as well., 254795=I visited the Atlanta campus back in January and it was beautiful. Unfortunately we were not able to view the freshmen dorms. Hopefully I will be able to view those soon., 36939=Savannah is truly the City of Hospitality. It is a beautiful, quaint town, with all the charm and allure of a big city. Broughton Street has every place you could hope to shop (and more!), and exploring the many side streets and lovely squares will yield hidden antique shops and thrift stores, perfect for rummaging through for the next art project. If you don't enjoy the heat, don't worry! Savannah cools off around November, and it's like most temperate places' autumn. The sunsets are glorious., 933985=These aren't really any traditions but usually Fall quarter students seem to have a lot more fun, and it's usually the time when students tend to slack off quite a bit. After winter break everyone's typically pretty calmed down and focused on their school and just trying to finish out the year. But for an FYI, most SCAD kids live in the apartment complex right next door to school- 1660 Apartments.}",
