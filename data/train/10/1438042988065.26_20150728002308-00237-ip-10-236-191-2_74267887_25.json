Larry Wall, with the help of oodles of other folks. AUTHOR See also the perlrun mapage. Notice that the Perl utility scripts such as perldoc and perlbug are in the /usr/perl5/bin directory, so if you wish to use them you need to include /usr/perl5/bin in your PATH environment variable. Any additional modules that you choose to install will be placed in the /usr/perl5/site_perl/5.8.4 directory. The /usr/perl5/vendor_perl directory is reserved for SMI-provided modules. The Perl shipped with Solaris is installed under /usr/perl5 rather than the default /usr/local location. This is so that it can coexist with a customer-installed Perl in the default /usr/local location. Environment Variables Okay, that's definitely enough hype.

See perldiag for explanations of all Perl's diagnostics. The `use diagnostics' pragma automatically turns Perl's normally terse warnings and errors into these longer forms. Compilation errors will tell you the line number of the error, with an indication of the next token or token type that was to be examined. (In a script passed to Perl via -e switches, each -e is counted as one line.) Setuid scripts have additional constraints that can produce error messages such as \"Insecure dependency\". See perlsec. Did we mention that you should definitely consider using the -w switch? Notes Perl 5.8.4 has been built to be largefile-aware and to use 64\u2013bit integers, although the interpreter itself is a",
