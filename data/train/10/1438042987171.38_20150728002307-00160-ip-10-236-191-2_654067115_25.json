    "textAfterTable": "New \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 03-BAD12 Our new SuperPond 4\" Aerating Bottom Drain, 03-BAD12, has features not available on other bottom drains. You can install it now into a 4\" or 3\" PVC pipe, and hook up the air hose to the barbed fitting when you are building your pond. Liner is sandwiched between the flange (supplied) and the bottom half of the unit to make your drain watertight.\u00a0 Why do I need an Aerating Bottom Drain? First, the rising air column from your BAD10 or 12 entrains a tremendous amount of water with it, which means that as the water rises to the surface with the air, it has to be replaced from the pond water around it. This creates a current of water moving across the bottom of the pond towards the drain, dragging dead algae, fish waste, leaves, etc. into the drain for removal. This of course means ultimately you will be rewarded with a cleaner, clearer, healthier and odor free pond. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You can even add air to your existing Tetra bottom drain if desired by replacing your Tetra Bottom drains' dome with the RND10-1 or RND12-1 air stations. Power your air pump with a timer or solar switch to aerate your pond during the night, the time",
