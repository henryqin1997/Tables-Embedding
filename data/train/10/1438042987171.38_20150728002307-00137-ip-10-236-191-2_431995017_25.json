Before providing service for a domain, the service provider may wish to verify that the entity that set up the service is the owner, or authorized controller, of the domain. The service provider gives the entity some information, such as a particular pair of name servers, and instructs the entity to have the domain registrar put the information into the name server (NS) record(s) for the domain. The service provider then queries NS for the domain and compares the NS record(s) returned with the information provided to the entity. If the NS records match the information given to the entity, then the service provider concludes that the entity has control over the domain, and uses the DNS records provided by the entity to provide service. 20090049198 Published Description Patent application number Stuart James Dent, Redmond, WA US 09-27-2012 Process for Preparing Clustered Functional Polyorganosiloxanes, and Methods for Their Use - A hydrosilylation process",
