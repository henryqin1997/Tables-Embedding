            "TWIRP week is also known as The Woman Is Required to Pay. If you're a girl and you want to go on a date with a guy that you've had your eye on, you put up a poster with their name on it and they will (usually) accept. After the poster is up, every day the girl leaves a clue for him about who it is that TWIRPed him OR makes him do something ridiculous. At the end of the week the girl finally reveals herself and takes the guy on a date, and, yes, she pays for it. It happens once a semester and is a HUGE deal! Not to mention, the posters are up for everyone to see and sometimes the guys have to dress up in strange costumes or wear silly things.",
            "Currently, there are two dining options on campus: the caf, and the grille. There are a lot of options daily for what you want to eat and it is really nice, especially when you have to eat there every day! The grille also serves Starbucks and really good smoothies. Fall 2013 there will be an Einstein Bagels available in the new state of the art communications building!",
            "I lived in Bridges dorm my first semester and it was very clean and very nice, much like a hotel room. My second semester, however, I moved to Kendrick dorm, the all girls dorm, and I loved it A LOT more. It had a very homey feel to it. Depending on what you like, there is a dorm for you.",
            "The bible classes require a lot more studying than some of the basics, which seems a little off. However, if you are trying to learn more about the Bible this is definitely the place to gain that knowledge.",
            "Don't be afraid to go to the professors for help or any questions. They are GREAT at making sure you get the grade that you earn.",
            "They provide a lot of financial help. The people that attend are overall very kind. The professors really do care about how you are doing in the classroom."

Also for those students who are seeking God's direction in what He wants for their lives and just want to encounter Him. Tips for prospective students I encourage students to apply for as much scholarships possible and for grants. Loans will always have to be paid in return. I encourage students to talk with the University advisor to make sure that is all that they are looking for. Bang for the buck The University is expensive. However, there is student loans, grants, and financial aid for students. Along with school scholarships. Am enjoying being here I enjoy being on oncampus classes. I learn better on campus. People are friendly and helpful. Am learning a lot Southwestern Assemblies of God University is a great Christian Faith based University.
