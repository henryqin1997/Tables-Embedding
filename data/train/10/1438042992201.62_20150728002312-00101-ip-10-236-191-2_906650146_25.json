            "To survive here, you must be self-motivated and community-oriented. Additionally, the feeling of being inadequate compared to one's classmates is very common. Confidence coming into school will go a long way in ensuring you survive first semester.",
            "Primal Scream occurs in Harvard Yard the midnight before finals period begins. Hundreds of people come to the Yard, strip down to nothing, and run a lap! It is a very exhilarating experiences. Basically everything at Harvard is steeped in tradition. We have a different name for everything, which may lead to some confusion when you tell someone that you are concentrating in HDRB, rather than majoring in it.",
            "Harvard is not cheap, but if your family qualifies, financial aid is very generous. It is a true investment in your future. A Harvard degree is a strong starting place for any career, which means you will probably be able to pay off any debts you incur.",
            "Boston is so close! Take the T to see museums, aquariums and baseball games! Harvard Square and the surrounding area are full of restaurants of all types. I would also recommend brushing up on pool, ping pong, poker and foosball. There are places to play scattered all around campus, and these are a great way to pass the time and relieve stress! There are parties of course, but mostly on Friday and Saturday. It is rare to find anyone hungover on a Tuesday morning. Sporting events, (yes, Harvard is a Division 1 school), are also a great way to show your love for your school.",
            "As an athlete, I eat LOTS of dining hall food, and am usually fully satisfied. Freshmen all eat in the same Gothic style hall, which can be very fun if you can find your friends, and rather overwhelming if you have to search the rows and rows of tables for a while to find a place to sit. The dining hall can feel a bit crowded at peak meal times, but it is generally easy to find a little corner. Upperclassmen dining halls serve the same food, but it is made in smaller portions, and therefore tastes infinitely better. The rooms are also much smaller and cozier. They strive for a family style set up.",
            "Harvard cares very strongly about dorm life, since it is an invaluable part of community building. Freshman dorms are some of the best in the country, with many students having singles attached to a large common room for desks and entertainment. Upperclassmen houses are better still, if possible. Each house has its own dining hall, library, fitness room, and special feature, which could be anything from a rock wall to a pottery studio.",
            "Harvard is all about seeking help when you need it. Your lectures will be challenging, your problem sets hard, and your exams still harder. However, there is a strong system of support in place for every class. Professors love to meet with students, and your classmates themselves are almost always willing to help. The image people have of a population of cutthroat, backstabbing library zombies is simply false.",
            "Do something nontraditional, and be confident. If you are considering Harvard, you find it easy to get an A in your high school classes. It is the time outside of those classes that determines who is accepted and who is not. A r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 a mile long typically speaks of loose involvement in many clubs for the sake of appearing well-rounded. More impressive are the students who have devoted themselves wholeheartedly to a true passion and have exceeded expectations in that field.",
            "Harvard is a home for outstanding students, who love to learn for the sole purpose of personal development. Once you walk through Johnson Gate and touch John Harvard's foot for the first time, you are on a path to great things. Harvard is a lifetime institution; not merely a four year college."

Try do something unique and creative during your high school years. Take risks, go on adventures. These kinds of things look great on apps and they make for great essays. Bang for the buck By and far, Harvard has the best financial aid of any college in the world. Income < $60k, you're in for free. FREE. You can't beat free. Even upper income family receive a lot of aid here. In many cases, they'll even send you refund checks when you have a positive balance from extra outside scholarship money. Am enjoying being here I absolutely enjoy being there. Wonderful students, wonderful staff. People actually care about you at Harvard. People always ask me, Do they party at Harvard? Yes! Maybe not as crazy as some schools, but we definitely have some great parties. The Cambridge/Boston location is very exciting. The only con I've noticed is a lack of school spirit sometimes. Am learning a lot YES, YES, YES. You will learn tons and only from the best and the brightest. The professors are",
