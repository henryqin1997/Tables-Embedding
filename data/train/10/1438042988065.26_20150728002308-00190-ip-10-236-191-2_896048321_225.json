There are so many things to do: clubs, recreational sports, sporting events (division 1 HUSKIES!), etc. Sign up for your A&O sessions (advising and orientation) early! The early the date, the chances of getting a better class schedule will greatly increase, especially since the freshman class size should range from 2000 to 3000., 17299=Tuition is going up this fall of 2009, and up again in 2010. Times are tight, so there's a definite sense that the increase in tuition coupled with the decrease in professors is a bit of a jip for the students., 667167=I have never felt safer anywhere. Last quarter I had classes until 9:30 at night and had to walk back to my sorority by myself and I felt very safe. There is also a night-ride you can call to drive or walk you from place to place during the night., 637573=I am a 38 year old student and do not live in the dorms. Off campus housing can be more affordable than dorms, depending on what you consider affordable and reasonable. I live in a comfortable, though not luxurious, house. I have three other housemates. We can easily bus, walk and drive to UW, the Avenue, and the grocery stores in the area. Housing moves very fast in July and August so if you found a place you like, or potential housemates, secure it as quickly as possible., 481921=There is a large greek system at UW Seattle. There are thirty three fraternities and seventeen sororities, and we have been adding chapters each year for the past few years. All freshman new members in a chapter live in starting in September when school starts and both sororities and fraternities can be, and usually are cheeper than living in a dorm and having a dining account. The greek system houses are all located across the street from campus in a four block area, and there are about two thousand people in our system which can attest to its strength and offerings., 1083231=The wide range of dorm buildings allows students to live in quite a few locations on campus. There are dorms built in 2012 and others that dated back a century. There is even a new dorm being constructed right now for move in during the second quarter of this school year. The amenities available in the assortment of living choices will satisfy all personality types. This atmosphere promotes new friendships and the potential to find lifetime relationships., 818402=The activity center will be opening for 2012-13 academic year. There are plenty of clubs to join but you are also only a bus ride away from downtown Seattle which has a great night life.}",

This school does not hand-hold you by any means. You are responsible for figuring out how to get that extra financial aid, what classes to register for, and how to manage your schedule. Granted, there are many knowledgeable outlets for help and guidance (Mary Gates Undergraduate Advising, Departmental Advisers, Husky Mentors program to name a few), but an education at this school mainly consists of you alone actively pursuing your goals. This definitely fosters good leadership skills. Tips for prospective students Due to economic pressures this year, the state budget for our school's funding has unfortunately dropped and many of this year's students are planning more for our financial future at this school (my primary reason for coming to Cappex). My first piece of advice would be to get",
