The most important use of primary phosphines, such as tert-butylphosphine, includes as precursors for the production of semiconductor materials in the electronics industry. Primary Phosphines ORGANOPHOSPHINE DERIVATIVES Organophosphine derivatives are manufactured by Nippon Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd under the trade name \u201cHISHICOLIN\u201d include alkylphosphines and associated derivatives, such as chlorophosphines, phosphine oxides and sulfides, phosphonium salts, etc. Nippon Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd believes that organophosphine derivatives have a great potential for industrial uses in electronic materials, catalysts, additives for polymers, pharmaceuticals and many other areas. Nippon Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd has been the only manufacturer of phosphine gas in Japan, and supplies phosphine gas to many customers in the semiconductor (high-purity grade) and insecticide (industrial grade) industries worldwide. Based on phosphine gas technology, a multi-purpose commercial plant for the production of organophosphine derivatives was built in 1987. Since then, organophosphine derivatives have been one of the core commercial products of Nippon Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd.",
    "textAfterTable": "Secondary Phosphines Secondary dialkylphosphines are also produced in the same way as primary phosphines. The most characteristic advantage of secondary phosphines is the reactivity of the unsubstituted P-H bond in the molecule. Nippon Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd is developing a variety of secondary phosphines as intermediates for the preparation of asymmetric tertiary phosphines, bisphosphines, and others.
