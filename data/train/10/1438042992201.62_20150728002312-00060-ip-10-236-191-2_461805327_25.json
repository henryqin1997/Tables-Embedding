She has been nominated for the Hugo award for Best Fan Artist seven times, and won it in 2003 and 2005. \u00a0Her art is available from Woodlore Pyrography Forgotten Futures Forgotten Futures is a shareware role-playing game whose core rules material, supplements, and adventures have been published on disk and on line since 1993. Previous supplements have been based on Victorian and Edwardian scientific romances and fantasies. FF X is a first, based on a modern fantasy with a strong Victorian feel. While it has not been possible to include the full text, as with previous Forgotten Futures releases, it's readily available and one of the most readable books to have been used as the basis for a Forgotten Futures setting. \u00a0One previous release for the game has included material on dragons; FF VIII is based on the children's stories of Edith Nesbit, and includes descriptions of several dragon species, some possessing strong magical powers. See later sections for more on crossovers with this and other settings. \u00a0The first Forgotten Futures material was published as ASCII text files. Later releases used HTML, and all of the existing material has now been converted to that format. However, the limitations of HTML make printing difficult and layout somewhat hit-or-miss. Better results are now possible using PDF; FF X and future releases will appear in PDF and HTML versions. \u00a0This supplement is distributed without charge - if you find it useful and wish to encourage the author to write more please consider registering or purchasing the Forgotten Futures CD-ROM; visit www.forgottenfutures.co.uk and follow the links to the game.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{132340=Some gently-born dragons who cling tightly to the rank in which they were born, or have achieved by marriage or accomplishment, do not favour those whom life has placed in rank above them. The Exalt did not suffer from this fault. There were not many who ranked above her own Exalted status, but those there were, Eminent and Eminences, Augusts and Augustas, she courted assiduously. She often regretted the loss of the Majestics and Highnesses and Honourables of old, there was nothing she would have liked so much as the thrill of having a Highness deign to drop in on a party she had arranged. Deprived of this, she made the most of August Fidrak, who endured her fussing graciously. Tooth and Claw - XV:56, 186608=Q. What else would you suggest people read, I mean, if they were to enjoy Tooth and Claw? \u00a0A. Anthony Trollope. Good places to start are the stand-alone books, like The American Senator, The Vicar of Bullhampton, Is He Popenjoy?, Orley Farm. Trollope wrote about forty novels and I haven't found them all yet. The series are splendid, but they have to be read in order and it isn't always easy to find them in order. There's a great Trollope resource page. Other than Trollope, a few really good modern Victorian novels are John Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman, Margaret Forster's Lady's Maid, A.S. Byatt's Possession. Jo Walton - Tooth and Claw FAQ \"She'd like me to bring a dragon home, I suppose. It would serve her right if I did, some creature that would make the house intolerable to her.\" Anthony Trollope - Framley Parsonage, 1859, quoted in Tooth and Claw., 761553=Many contributors have been involved in the various releases of Forgotten Futures over the last fifteen years and it's well-nigh impossible to name all of them. For this version in particular thanks go especially to Jo Walton for having had confidence in me to do justice to her work, to Sue Mason for allowing me to use so much of her art, to various play-testers at Dragonmeet 2007 and on line, and to those who have contributed to discussion of the setting, rules rewrite, etc. via Livejournal, Steve Jackson Games discussion groups, the uk.games.roleplay newsgroup, and other sites. There are too many to name, and I would hate to leave anyone out, so please accept the thought for the deed., 439840=FF II is set in a solar system in which antigravity was discovered in 1900, and most worlds are habitable. For this setting it would be very easy to add dragons - Tiamath and the Yarge countries are on Venus! There's a minor difference in the length of the year, which can easily be ignored. The first Terran explorers visited one of the other continents, where they discovered a race of flying humans and concluded that they had never fallen from grace. Because the planet is shrouded in clouds they never saw any other part of the planet, and never realised that there were other intelligent species elsewhere. Later explorers could find them. In this sort of setting it's traditional that the Terran explorers take the human side in whatever war happens to be in progress; unfortunately this may mean that powerful flying warships will be deployed against Tiamath, with possibly catastrophic results. A neat twist on this might be that one of Tiamath's Yarge neighbours is attacked by the Terran invaders (there's ample precedent for this in pulp SF and in the source book A Honeymoon in Space), who have their own evil agenda; perhaps they're stealing beautiful Yarge princesses, or trying to convert the Yarge to their incomprehensibly alien cross religion. Dragons might be able to reach the Terran ships as they rain destruction down on the Yarge; if they don't help, it may only be a matter of time before the alien invaders turn their attention to Tiamath. Of course the Terrans have Maxim guns and other nasty surprises, so this won't exactly be safe or easy..., 30570=Excerpt copyright \u00a9 Jo Walton 2003 - the first chapter in its entirety is on line at www.zorinth.net/bluejo/, 121807=With the following exceptions these titles are hereditary or can be acquired by marriage: \u00a0The Majestic, if any, is appointed by Parliament; Majestic may also be translated as \"warlord\" or \"dictator\" depending on the terms of the appointment. His wife is the Highness. Any appointed heirs (succession is not hereditary) are the Honourables, who also act as deputies or generals. Currently these posts are vacant. \u00a0August is not hereditary, and can only be awarded by the Majestic. It is generally awarded for services to the state, valour, etc. Holders are accorded almost as much respect as an Eminent. \u00a0With these exceptions a title is generally an indication of the area of land held, and possibly of the size of the dragon bearing the title - it takes a big dragon or a formidable fighting reputation, which usually amounts to the same thing, to hold onto a title and govern land effectively. \u00a0A Majestic can award or create any other title, of course, adding new hereditary Peers at any level. But wholesale creation of new Peers is considered a sign of weakness, indicating that the Majestic is at odds with Parliament and wishes to weight their votes. For one-off cases an alternative that causes fewer problems is to appoint a new Peer to take over an existing title that has no incumbent., 189320=If players prefer a more active type of campaign your best source is probably Victorian detective and adventure stories; the works of Wilkie Collins, most notably The Moonstone (1868) and The Woman in White (1860), are particularly good examples of the genre. In a more comedic vein The Wrong Box by Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne (1889) offers a light-hearted tale of concealed death, inheritance, and deception with a very draconic feel; the 1966 film starring Michael Caine, Peter Cook, and Dudley Moore is also recommended, though it lacks some of the demented logic of the novel. The Wikipedia article on Tontines, the odd form of lottery which drives the plot of The Wrong Box, may also be a useful source of plot ideas., 187672=Referees who wish to reflect the Tooth and Claw setting accurately should begin by reading the book itself; the excerpts in this game can't give more than a hint of the flavour of the novel. At the time of writing (May 2008) it's out of print, but copies are readily available through numerous dealers. The unfinished sequel Those Who Favor Fire accompanies this sourcebook, but read Tooth and Claw first! Tooth and Claw bases much of its plot on social customs, etiquette, and the behaviour of its characters, with events driven by personalities. There is no \"fiendish plot\" driving events, just a series of circumstances that eventually culminate in a court case and the death of one of the characters, several romances, and the disgrace of someone with ideas above his station in life. It's entirely possible to follow this example and run a game that's based entirely on social interaction, with no violence other than that inherent in the normal personalities of dragons. For this sort of campaign the best source is probably Trollope. Numerous titles can be found on line via Project Gutenberg and other copyright-expired sources; see e.g. http://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/index.html and search for Trollope under author's names., 91925=Currency Tiamath's currency is based on the gold Crown, which has been in use for approximately 2500 years. Prior to that at least a dozen different Yarge coinages were in use, some of them long forgotten elsewhere. \u00a0Eventually financial confusion was so widespread that the Noble Assembly appointed the Majestic Thidris, whose sole responsibility was to resolve the mess. A new coin, the Crown (cr.), was designed and minted, with an agreed weight and metallic content; the other currencies could still be used, but only for their assayed value as gold. Today they are only found in the oldest hoards, with any oddities tending to be cashed in when an estate changes hands, and the Tiamath Crown is the hardest and most stable currency in the known world. \u00a0Unfortunately currency reform was not popular at the time, and Thidris was assassinated with his work only half-done. While the Crown and the smaller gold coins derived from it (the half-Crown, quarter-Crown, and eighth-Crown) were completely standardised, silver and copper coins remained in a hugely complicated mess. Things were made worse by the devaluation of silver when the mines of Tolga were first discovered; the value of silver coins plummeted compared to copper and gold, and remains unstable to this day. Silver is typically sold abroad. \u00a0For the last 850 years the value of the copper penny (pc.) has been set at a nominal 1/1000th Crown; theoretically a half-Crown is thus worth 500 pence, a quarter-Crown 250 pence, an eighth-Crown 125 pence. In practice all banks charge a commission, typically 3%, when changing copper for gold. So, for example, a dragon paying an eighth-crown for something costing 50 pence will be given 75 pence change, but the banks charge 125 pence plus the fee, rounded up to 129 pence, for an eighth crown. For this reason most merchants are happy to give small change, less eager to take it, and only the cheapest goods are priced in pence.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The Peerage Dragon titles are similar in purpose to those used by many Yarge cultures, approximate equivalents being: Contents Finally, perhaps the most wretched quarter of Irieth is the Skamble, a district of slums, warehouses, and breweries on the North bank of the river opposite the Cupola. The Planning Department recently unveiled proposals to redevelop the area, re-house many of the occupants, and demolish the worst of the slums. New facilities will include properly excavated homes, a new school, etc. The residents have cautiously welcomed the proposal, but critics note that it will do little to remedy the underlying problems of the area or provide new employment, and recent inflammatory pamphlets suggest that (despite the endorsement of several Old Religion priests) it is nothing more than a crude attempt to destroy Irieth's largest Old Religion community. Some other districts shown include the wealthy South-West Quarter, where many peers have their town houses, and the Marshalling Quarter, centred on the main army barracks for the city. At one time the surrounding streets were crowded with inns and less reputable facilities catering to the needs of soldiers, but these have gradually been replaced by wealthy",
