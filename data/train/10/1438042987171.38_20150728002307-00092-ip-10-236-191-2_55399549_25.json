Three plays later, Hill dumped the ball off to Best in the right flat on a screen play and the running back raced through the defense to the end zone for a 75-yard score and a 17-7 lead with 8:16 left in the half., 82648=After an exchange of punts to start the third quarter, the Eagles padded their lead with a nine-play drive that covered 65 yards and saw McCoy punch the ball into the end zone from four yards out with 5:54 left in the period., 77087=Vick started in place of an injured Kevin Kolb, who suffered a concussion in last week's loss to Green Bay, and went 21-of-34 for 284 yards. He added seven carries for 37 yards for the Eagles (1-1), who dropped a 27-20 game to Green Bay in the opener at home last week. Vick's last start was on December 31, 2006 when he was with Atlanta., 82281=Philly's defense held Detroit on the next touch and the team got the ball back with 1:12 to play. On the third play, Vick heaved the ball down field and Jackson came down with it for a 53-yard gain. Several plays later, Vick connected with Maclin just over the goal line for a nine-yard score to give the Eagles a 21-17 lead heading into the locker room., 80701=The Lions responded on their ensuing touch and used the ground game to good effect. Runs of 13 and 33 yards by Best got the ball deep into Eagles territory. On the sixth play of the drive, Best took a draw right up the middle and into the end zone from 14 yards out to tie the game with 5:39 left in the first., 79380=Detroit forced Philly into a three-and-out and got the ball back at its own 45 with 3:01 to play. On the first play, Best caught a short pass and took it 17 yards into Philly territory. Best added another 12-yard catch and an 11-yard grab by Brandon Pettigrew got the ball to the 14. After an illegal formation call nullified a Calvin Johnson touchdown, Hill again found Johnson in the end zone and Johnson caught the two-point conversion to make it a 35-32 game with 1:50 to play., 81903=The Eagles answered on their next touch. Facing a 3rd-and-9 near midfield, Vick avoided the pressure and hit Cooper over the middle for the wideout's first career catch and a 20-yard gain. Several plays later on second down, McCoy took a delayed handoff up the middle and into the end zone from 14 yards out to make it a 17-14 game with 3:53 left in the first half., 80427=The Eagles needed just four plays to get into the end zone for a 7-0 lead. On 1st-and-10 at the Detroit 45 after a roughing the passer call, Vick hit Jackson over the middle and the speedy receiver ran through the defense to paydirt with 8:39 left in the first.}",
