            "RADIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, BASE STATION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, RADIO TERMINAL, AND RADIO COMMUNICATION METHOD - A radio communication system which automatically selects a communication path having a higher speed is provided when a plurality of communication paths having a different speed from each other are available for data transmission between the radio terminal and the base station control equipment. The radio terminal receives a data frame and sends back an ACK signal for the data frame via the communication path through which the data frame has been received. At this time, the radio terminal acquires data of the frame with a sequence number having received at the first time, and if the frame with the same sequence number is received later, the frame is discarded. However, the ACK signal is sent back in respective cases. The base station control equipment transmits a first data frame to the radio terminal via the plurality of communication paths and transmits subsequent data frames to the radio terminal via one communication path through which the ACK signal for the first data frame has arrived the earliest.",
            "RADIO COMMUNICATION METHOD AND SYSTEM - The first communication apparatus transmits existence confirmation request notices to the second communication apparatus, using the first frequency band and the second frequency band that is a frequency band different from the first frequency band. The second communication apparatus returns existence confirmation response notices as a response to the correctly received existence confirmation request notices of the first frequency band and the second frequency band, to the first communication apparatus, using the frequency bands corresponding to the first frequency band and the second frequency band. The first communication apparatus, after having received one or more of the existence confirmation response notices transmitted from the second communication apparatus, exchanges data with the second communication apparatus, using the frequency band that corresponds to the existence confirmation response notice transmitted through the higher frequency band among the first and second frequency bands.",
