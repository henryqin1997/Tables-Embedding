These detected that the earliest subclades of R1b are found in western Asia and the most recent in western Europe.[6][8][14] While age estimates in these articles are all more recent than the Last Glacial Maximum, all mention the Neolithic, when farming was introduced to Europe from the Middle East as a possible candidate period. Myres et al. (August 2010), and Cruciani et al. (August 2010) both remained undecided on the exact dating of the migration or migrations responsible for this distribution, not ruling out migrations as early as the Mesolithic or as late as Hallstatt but more probably Late Neolithic.[6] They noted that direct evidence from ancient DNA may be needed to resolve these gene flows.[6] Lee et al. (May 2012) analysed the ancient DNA of human remains from the Late Neolithic Bell Beaker site of Kromsdorf, Germany identifying two males as belonging to the Y haplogroup R1b.[15] Analysis of ancient Y DNA from the remains of populations derived from early Neolithic Central and North European LBK settlements have not yet found males belonging to haplogroup R1b.[16][17], 119598=R-M167/SRY2627 (R-P312-2b1), 129336=DF13==R-Z255===L159.2/S169.2====Z16433 (R-P312-4f) R-Z255===CTS12583/S3802, 60026=Trofimova et al. (2015) found a surprising high frequency of R1b-L23 (Z2105/2103) among the peoples of the Volga-Ural region. 21 out of 58 (36.2%) of Burzyan Bashkirs, 11 out of 52 (21.2%) of Udmurts, 4 out of 50 (8%) of Komi, 4 out of 59 (6.8%) of Mordvins, 2 out of 53 (3.8%) of Besermyan and 1 out of 43 (2.3%) of Chuvash were R1b-L23 (Z2105/2103),[30] the type of R1b found in the recently analyzed Yamna remains of the Samara Oblast and Orenburg Oblast.[25], 71262=As discussed above, in articles published around 2000 it was proposed that this clade had been in Europe before the last Ice Age,[32] but by 2010 more recent periods such as the European Neolithic have become the focus of proposals. A range of newer estimates for R1b1b2, or at least its dominant parts in Europe, are from 4,000 to a maximum of about 10,000 years ago, and looking in more detail is seen as suggesting a migration from Western Asia via southeastern Europe.[2][6][10][14] Western European R1b is dominated by R-P310.[2], 57578=R1b1a2 (2011 name) is defined by the presence of SNP marker M269. R1b1a2* or M269(xL23) is found at highest frequency in the central Balkans notably Kosovo with 7.9%, Macedonia 5.1% and Serbia 4.4%.[6] Kosovo is notable in having a high percentage of descendant L23* or L23(xM412) at 11.4% unlike most other areas with significant percentages of M269* and L23* except for Poland with 2.4% and 9.5% and the Bashkirs of southeast Bashkortostan with 2.4% and 32.2% respectively.[6] Notably this Bashkir population also has a high percentage of M269 sister branch M73 at 23.4%.[6] Five individuals out of 110 tested in the Ararat Valley, Armenia belonged to R1b1a2* and 36 to L23*, with none belonging to known subclades of L23.[27], 63294=From 2003 to 2005 what is now R1b1a2 was designated R1b3. From 2005 to 2008 it was R1b1c. From 2008 to 2011 it was R1b1b2., 148512=R1b1c (formerly R1b1a) is defined by the presence of SNP marker V88, the discovery of which was announced in 2010 by Cruciani et al.[24] The V88 group in Africa may be linked with Chadic languages and an Iberian origin.[68] Apart from individuals in southern Europe and Western Asia, the majority of R-V88 was found in northern and central Africa:, 53995=R1b1*, like R1b* is rare. However, the skeletons of two males from both a Mesolithic pre-Yamna Samara culture burial dated to around 5650-5555 BC north of the Caspian Sea and an early Neolithic Cardial culture burial dated to around 5178-5066 BC at the Els Trocs site, Aragon, in the Pyrenees, Spain were found to contain R1b1*.[25] As mentioned above, examples are described in older articles, for example two in a sample from Turkey,[3] but most cases, especially in Africa, are now thought to be mostly in the more recently discovered sub-clade R-V88 (see below). Most or all examples of R1b therefore fall into subclades R1b1c (R-V88) or R1b1a (R-P297). Cruciani et al. in the large 2010 study found 3 cases amongst 1173 Italians, 1 out of 328 West Asians and 1 out of 156 East Asians.[24] Varzari found 3 cases in the Ukraine, in a study of 322 people from the Dniester-Carpathian region, who were P25 positive, but M269 negative.[26] Cases from older studies are mainly from Africa, the Middle East or Mediterranean, and are discussed below as probable cases of R1b1c (R-V88)., 72595=In this period between 2000 and 2010 that it became clear that especially Western European R1b is dominated by specific sub-clades of R-M269 (with some small amounts of other types found in areas such as Sardinia[6][11]). Within Europe, R-M269 is dominated by R-M412, also known as R-L51, which according to Myres et al. (2010) is \"virtually absent in the Near East, the Caucasus and West Asia.\" This Western European population is further divided between R-P312/S116 and R-U106/S21, which appear to spread from the western and eastern Rhine river basin respectively. Myres et al. note further that concerning its closest relatives, in R-L23*, that it is \"instructive\" that these are often more than 10% of the population in the Caucasus, Turkey, and some southeast European and circum-Uralic populations. In Western Europe it is present but in generally much lower levels apart from \"an instance of 27% in Switzerland's Upper Rhone Valley.\"[6] In addition, the sub-clade distribution map, Figure 1h titled \"L11(xU106,S116)\", in Myres et al. shows that R-P310/L11* (or as yet undefined subclades of R-P310/L11) occurs only in frequencies greater than 10% in Central England with surrounding areas of England and Wales having lower frequencies.[6] This R-P310/L11* is almost non-existent in the rest of Eurasia and North Africa with the exception of coastal lands fringing the western and southern Baltic (reaching 10% in Eastern Denmark and 6% in northern Poland) and in Eastern Switzerland and surrounds.[6], 28714=For clarity, the identifiers below are those from both the 2010 and 2011 revisions of the ISOGG tree.[2], 140620=R-P312-3 (R-U152) is defined by the presence of the marker U152, also called S28.[2] Its discovery was announced in 2005 by EthnoAncestry[60] and subsequently identified independently by Sims et al. (2007).[53] Myres et al. report this clade \"is most frequent (20-44%) in Switzerland, Italy, France and Western Poland, with additional instances exceeding 15% in some regions of England and Germany.\"[39] Similarly Cruciani et al. reported frequency peaks in Northern Italy and France.[61] Out of a sample of 135 men in Tyrol, Austria, 9 tested positive for U152/S28.[62] Far removed from this apparent core area, Myres et al. also mention a sub-population in north Bashkortostan where 71% of 70 men tested were in R-U152. They propose this to be the result of an isolated founder effect.[6], 107511=While this sub-clade of R1b is frequently discussed amongst genetic genealogists, the following table represents the peer-reviewed findings published so far in the 2007 articles of Myres et al. and Sims et al.[39][53], 147474=R1b1b is defined by the presence of SNP marker M335. This haplogroup was created by the 2008 reorganisation of nomenclature and should not be confused with R1b1b2, which was previously called R1b1c. Its position in relation to the much more populous sub-clade R1b1a is uncertain.[1] The M335 marker was first published in 2004, when one example was discovered in Turkey, which was classified at that time as R1b4.[3], 56247=R1b1a is defined by the presence of SNP marker P297. In 2008 this polymorphism was recognised to combine M73 and M269 into one R1b1a cluster.[1] The majority of Eurasian R1b is within this clade, representing a very large modern population. Although P297 itself has not yet been much tested for, the same population has been relatively well studied in terms of other markers. Therefore the branching within this clade can be explained in relatively high detail below. The skeleton of a male from a Chalcolithic/Bronze Age Yamna burial in the Samara area north of the Caspian Sea, dated to around 3305-2925 BC, was found to possibly contain R1b1a* being P297 positive but L51 negative.[25], 22107=Early research focused upon Europe. In 2000 Ornella Semino and colleagues argued that R1b had been in Europe before the end of the Ice Age, and had spread north from an Iberian refuge after the Last Glacial Maximum.[7] Age estimates of R1b in Europe have steadily decreased in more recent studies, at least concerning the majority of R1b, with more recent studies suggesting a Neolithic age or younger.[clarification needed][6][8][9][10] Only Morelli et al. have recently attempted to defend a Palaeolithic origin for R1b1b2.[11] Irrespective of STR coalescence calculations, Chikhi et al. pointed out that the timing of molecular divergences does not coincide with population splits; the TMRCA of haplogroup R1b (whether in the Palaeolithic or Neolithic) dates to its point of origin somewhere in Eurasia, and not its arrival in western Europe [1]. However, Michael R. Maglio argues that the closest branch of R1b is from Iberia and its small subclades found in West Asia, the Near East and Africa are examples of back migration, and not of its origin.[12], 8644=The alternative way of naming haplogroups is to refer to the SNP mutations used to define and identify them, for example \"R-M343\" which is equivalent to \"R1b.\" Haplogroup R1b is in other words now identified by the presence of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation M343, which was discovered in 2004.[3] From 2002 to 2005, R1b was defined by the presence of the SNP named P25., 10468=Before 2002, major Y DNA signatures based on markers other than SNPs were recognized. In Western Europe the STR haplotype known as the Atlantic Modal Haplotype was found to be most common by Wilson et al.[5] Even earlier research using RFLP genotyping identified two distinct haplotypes within R-M269. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia (e.g., the Balkans, Georgia and Turkey) \"haplotype 35\" or \"ht35\" was found to be a common form of R-M269, whereas in western Europe \"haplotype 15\" or \"ht15\" dominated in frequency.[3], 9369=Standardized naming as described above, both using phylogenetic or mutational systems, was first proposed in 2002 by the Y Chromosome Consortium. Before 2002, today's Haplogroup R1b had a number of names in differing nomenclature systems, such as Hg1 and Eu18.[4], 74818=In 2009, DNA extracted from the femur bones of 6 skeletons in an early-medieval burial place in Ergolding (Bavaria, Germany) dated to around 670 AD yielded the following results: 4 were found to be haplogroup R1b with the closest matches in modern populations of Germany, Ireland and the USA while 2 were in Haplogroup G2a.[33], 169531=Y-chromosomes known as R1b-M73 first appeared in the literature of Sengupta et al. in 2006 among 5 out of 25 Hazaras.[74] R1b-m73 was the sole type of R1b found in the Kumandin and a dominant clade in the South eastern Bashkirs. However, a 2010 study by Behar et al. showed that these same 5 Hazara did not belong to R1b but to R2 or Q, if this study by Behar is right than the Kumandins have no R1b. Ironically the Bashkirs still have a high percent of R1b (mostly-u152) even though some of the southern Bashkirs had mislabled Q which appeared to be R1b due to confusion between Q1a-m25 and R1b-p25. If Behar et al. is right about m73, then the Southeastern Bashkirs have both R1b and Q while all the other Bashkirs have a high frequency of R1b while only having 1-2% of Q.[75][76]}",

The only population yet recorded with a definite significant proportion of R1b* are the Kurds of southeastern Kazakhstan with 13%.[6][18] However, more recently, a large study of Y-chromosome variation in Iran, revealed R1b* as high as 4.3% among Persian sub-populations.[19] In a study of Jordan it was found that no less than 20 out of all 146 men tested (13.7%), including most notably 20 out of 45 men",
