Tabbia, Hernando, FL US 07-02-2009 RNSS-based lane-level vehicle tolling method and system - An RNSS-based lane-level vehicle tolling method and system for a roadway having at least one managed traffic lane and at least one unmanaged traffic lane, and on-vehicle equipment for use therein, overcome lane identification limitations of RNSS-based tolling and achieves lane-level tolling through explicit lane identification. In some embodiments, a vehicle transmits a lane presence indication (LPI) to indicate to off-vehicle toll processing whether the vehicle is currently in a managed or unmanaged traffic lane. In other embodiments, on-vehicle toll processing uses lane identification information locally to determine whether the vehicle is currently in a managed or unmanaged traffic lane. 20090171772 Published Description Patent application number Lawrence E. Sweeney, Jr., Atherton, CA US 04-01-2010 MULTI-DATABASE, RUNTIME DATABASE QUERY PERFORMANCE MONITORING - A method to monitor database performance includes gathering information from a remote, monitored database related to the monitored database performance during a predetermined time, collecting statistics corresponding to any queries executed during the predetermined time, testing at least one rule against the statistics corresponding to each query, and if the testing results in a rule violation, identifying the query that caused the rule violation. A method to monitor database performance includes gathering statistics related to execution of a query statement, comparing at least one of the statistics against at least one rule to determine if the statistics violates a",

Tannas, Orange, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20110075091 Apparatus and methods for cutting electronic displays during resizing - Apparatus and methods for resizing electronic displays are provided. The display includes a front plate, a back plate, a perimeter seal spacing the front and back plates apart, image-generating medium contained in an area between the plates, and polarizing layers and/or other films on the outer surfaces of the plates. A target portion of the display is identified, and a saw is passed along a cut line to create a channel that extends through the polarizer to the outer surface of the top plate. A scriber tool is passed along the cut line within the channel to create a scribe line in the outer surface of the top plate. The display is inverted, and the process repeated to cut a channel and scribe the bottom plate. The plates are broken along the scribe line, and a seal is applied along the exposed edge, which may penetrate between the plates. 03-31-2011 20110194053 APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR CUTTING ELECTRONIC DISPLAYS DURING RESIZING - Apparatus and methods for resizing electronic displays are provided.
