They give you $2800 on a card that you can only spend in their dining areas, which consists of over-priced food and allows you to run out months before the end of the semester, unlike the other universities with a set amount of meals per weak. The food was somewhat decent though., 383397=I can't answer that because I don't start until August of this year., 3535=Teachers hold higher degrees in their fields than at public universities. Most teachers hold a Masters or higher; a majority hold doctorates. This is my 2nd semester and I have noticed that each class seems to repeat a lot. Do not expect a lot of new information if you are in the business field. Most information I have received has been common sense or a repeat. This school is trying to get its accreditation up so expect easy classes to be HARD! Writing 2 papers 10-15 pages each class isn't uncommon. Expect to be graded hard for grammar and not so much the material you write. I have learned to be more focused. These teachers will not give you the easy way out and its almost impossible to get 100% on something. The grading scale is harder for 90% of the classes. You will not get a 4.0 credit for a class unless you have a 95% or higher etc.., 78576=Anyone who is dedicated and willing to provide the time and money for further education. You do not necessarily need to know your plan/major, but it does help. NSU is the type of university that is quick and to the point, they give you opportunities to get out of school as quick as possible, such as the Dual Admissions program---which basically ensures that your spot is being held at the medical school of your choice, so that you are not wait-listed. When i fist started college in August I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do with my future, I applied for the Nursing Program and got in... but my heart was not in that field. After speaking with my advisers and doing some research, I realized that i could do so much with a Psychology degree. I now hope to complete a four-year degree in psychology and then apply to Occupational therapy (OT) school., 436458=Nova Southeastern University's Meal Plan As a student in college, what food I am provided by my school's meal plan is important to me as this is the main source of nutrition throughout my time there. At NSU, everything may seem great at first, but thing's take a quick turn for the worse when the sudden realization of having to eat here for the entire year washes over my mind. Walking in the first time, the cafeteria has a normal-looking food court-styled setting. There is a Denny's, a Pizza Loft, and Subway, and a few other choices. From there, I realized there are not many things to choose from, especially for those with dietary needs (i.e. vegetarian, gluten-free, etc). I quickly got tired of eating the same few things every day, but couldn't look elsewhere as I am an on-campus student without a car. Don't get me wrong, the school attempts to switch things up by offering sushi on Mondays and Thursdays, but it's not enough variety. The cafeteria at NSU screamed mall food court and fast food to me. Good meal plans are able to accommodate every students\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? needs while also providing variety and nutrition. At my old school, University of Vermont (UVM), there were over fifteen different dining locations, two of which specialize towards vegetarian students and students with gluten-allergies, respectively. Each location offered fruits and veggies while also having their own specialty, like the store called Alice's which offered breakfast sandwiches that other places didn't. By having several options to choose from, students are able to obtain nutrition from different sources without feeling as if their diet has become mundane. Being able to feed students is a difficult task especially when it comes to working around their hectic schedules. Like most students, I tend to place academics first and eat when I'm freer to, however, not all stores on campus have closing times that work about my schedule. Although some stores, such as Starbucks, are open 24/7 on campus, that isn't enough to feed my hunger as it does with thirst. I am finished with classes around 8 PM on Thursdays, so it's rather disappointing when I need to wait for the next day simply because an option I want closes too early before my class even ends. At UVM, there are dining halls specifically designed to stay open until even the early mornings to feed students who were perhaps still in class or have studied too late. By having a place to eat that stays open even past the latest possible class, students at least had a place to eat when hungry after classes. These dining halls had slightly fewer options to choose from, but still had plenty of food at the same prices. Having slightly later closing times can help feed students with night classes who have a hunger to satisfy. Now to go over the meal plan itself. I am a little bias with this topic as UVM gave students the option to choose between points or unlimited meal plans while NSU simply stuck me with a point system. Points gave students a set number of cash points on their I.D. cards to spend at college stores like cash while the unlimited meal plan allowed students to eat at fewer available locations, but to eat as much as they wanted in buffet-style cafeterias. Along with both options, there were sub-options that were essentially the same thing, but at a cheaper price to accommodate those with financial issues. For example, going on the cheaper point plan simply gives the student fewer points to spend on food, but is the cheapest plan to be on. At NSU, I was given 1300 available meal points and that was it. I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing, but I would've liked the freedom to choose another option. The meal plan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s price itself, however, was fair. NSU's meal plan cost me $1300 for 1300 points, an even trade. On the other hand, UVM's point system offered either 1366 points for $1707 or 1050 points for $1341. The price was a bit higher, but UVM's point plans also both included 25 blocks which allowed the student to eat at the other meal plans' locations (the buffet-styled unlimited dining halls) 25 times. Both meal plans have their advantages and disadvantages when it comes to price and choice, but considering how much more I'm paying to stay at NSU, I can't help but to feel I'm not getting the right bang for my buck here. Along with the freedom of being able to choose a meal plan at UVM, it was also easy to locate food when I wanted it. The fifteen different dining locations that were nicely spread across campus which allowed students to walk less than a block before stopping in a shop that accepted their meal plan. Not having to walk very far to get a bite to eat is very beneficial for students especially for those who need to grab something quick and get to class. At NSU, the main dining area is the University Center located in the campus center. They offer the most choices there, though that doesn't mean there are many in the first place. The other dining locations for those on the meal plan are spread awkwardly throughout campus. The next dining area with the second most choices is on the complete opposite end of campus. The other choices are tiny stands that mainly offer small snacks and drinks and are dispersed in random buildings across campus. By having dining locations evenly spaced and in convenient areas for students to access, I am more likely to relieve my hunger right away by stopping in a nearby place rather than waiting for class to end and having to walk all the way to a main dining area to eat. I'm sure I'm not the only one who shares these opinions on the meal plan here at NSU, however, I'm also sure that there are people who actually enjoy the meal plan here. I can't help but to feel disappointed in NSU\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s meal plan especially when compared to the high standards of UVM\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s meal plan. If I were to choose a college based solely on the meal plan alone, I would choose UVM in a heartbeat; not only is their meal plan much better, but I also would\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?ve saved around eight grand. Not being able to eat when I want or being able to satisfy a craving because it's not available has made me view the food at NSU negatively. For a first-time college student, perhaps the food may seem exciting, but it didn't take long for me to become tired of my repetitive meal-schedule., 239252=There are brand new residence halls and the older residence halls are being completely renovated and will be finished by Fall 2012. The shuttle system is good, but could be improved., 116296=Nova is VERY expensive, so prepare yourself. At almost $1000 per credit hour in grad school, it would be wise to start saving in advance., 265352=All dorms are well kept and clean. Goodwin which is the freshman dorm are double occupancy dorms with a bathroom in each room. Commons is a four room suite with two bathrooms. This building is the newest dorm on campus. Ffv are the oldest dorms on campus but are apartment styled so is Clc. Both of these were just renovated in summer 2012. All dorms are no more then five mins from classes on the main campus., 534581=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
