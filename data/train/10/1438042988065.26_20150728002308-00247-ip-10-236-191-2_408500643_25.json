In reality, the EU`s goal of becoming the most dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010 is no more than an illusion.The figures in the Commission report reveal that the member states are far from implementing the agreed Lisbon Strategy-policy. The EU`s target of ensuring that 70% of Europeans take part in the labour market appears out of reach since the current rate is 65.5%. In areas that are seen as key to keeping Europe competitive, like R&D investment and high-speed Internet access,there is stagnation. Spending on R&D and innovation remains at a stable low of 1,84% of GDP, with only Sweden and Finland performing above the 3% agreed in the Lisbon Strategy., 7116=Guy Verhofstadt Group Leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe To proceed reading the full ALDE EU 2020 Strategy, 6810=In March 2010 the Commission will present its final \"EU 2020\" strategy. By coming forward with bold proposals to put the European Commission in the driver seat of economic growth and jobs in the next decade, it will find a strong ally in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.}",
