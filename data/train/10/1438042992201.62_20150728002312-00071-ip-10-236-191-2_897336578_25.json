            "Campus Police were on duty 24/7. What I really liked about this was that there was a number you could dial after 9pm and someone would come escort you back to your dorm. I never felt uncomfortable walking across campus.",
            "There is such a variety!!",
            "It is a good school for anyone. You just need to find the kind of people you feel comfortable spending time with. There are groups of people out there for everyone.",
            "Being from Missouri, I really had no idea what Oktoberfest was. Oktoberfest is huge in La Crosse. The whole town pretty much shuts down for about 3 days and turns in to a giant celebration. Check it out ~ but go with a group of friends!",
            "There is always an event going on. Look online, listen to the gossip, and make sure to check the UWLAX webpage! Definately catch a football game or two. It is worth the cold. =)",
            "Student Life was always hosting some kind of event ~ or knew of one they could point you to. Downtown La Crosse was just a 10 minute walk from campus, too, so it was pretty easy to catch a movie, go to the river, get a drink, etc. LAX is also on the bus line, so you can travel to the next town in a matter of minutes. Make sure you check out The Riv!!",
            "I am a vegetarian so I was a bit worried about the food UWL would have to offer. Even though some of the dishes were not too veggie friendly, the dining services ALWAYS had something I could eat!! I loved their variety of hot, fresh meals that were interesting. In the mornings they had an omelette bar where a chef would make omelettes to order and in the evenings they had a bar where you could make your own stirfry. I also loved the fact that they were open so many hours during the day ~ and that they were spread all over campus.",
            "I loved my dorm experience! Granted, I had a terrible first year thanks to some obnoxious roomies, but my last years were quite enjoyable. It all depends on who you choose and where you choose to live. Do some research and make smart choices. If you want to get some studying done, the party dorm probably isn't the best bet.",
            "UWL is pretty demanding, academically speaking. However, as much as the professors expect from you, they give back in their teaching. The learning atmosphere is also fairly laidback, which is a unique and interesting phenomena.",
            "Get to know your professors - they will be key factors in your success. Class sizes can vary anywhere from 15-50 students depending on the class, so make sure you chat with your professor from time to time! This is helpful if you forget an assignment or need to make up an exam for some reason or another.",
            "UWL was a great school in promoting educational and personal growth. It also encouraged multicultural diversity and understanding amongst the student population. The atmosphere was great for both academics and fun."

Always a great time!, 165207=I wasn't particularly fond of the food service for the 2011-2012 year, but Sodexo is the new company as of Fall 2012, which I hear is pretty great. The food service, however, is awesome. The employees are so very nice. I looked forward to getting my sack lunch from Theresa every other day!, 195637=Use the information given online and by academic advisers to find classes best for you. Also look at the online catalog of descriptions of classes to help chose ones you are interested in. The new scheduling system is so specific you can schedule to not have 7:45 am classes, which is very helpful., 2594=I will be a senior this at the beginning of the 2010-2011 academic year, and couldn't be happier with the college I chose! the classes are tough, obviously, but its so worth it. I am a chemistry major and mathematics minor, and i don't need to go to some big expensive private school to learn alot, I'm getting it done right here!, 351669=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 24986=Oktoberfest is a huge celebration every October in the La Crosse community. There are plenty of festivities including a parade, fair grounds, competitions, pageants, and much more., 37491=There are many clubs, organizations, sports and intramural sports to choose from. The campus offers lots of activities around campus, as well as guest speakers like Joe Biden who was here in October. La Crosse is also full of beautiful bluffs that you can climb!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here It is the perfect size school for me. It has about 10,000 students: not too small, not too big. The campus is small enough to walk end to end in 10 minutes. I am on the gymnastics team here and I love it! It's a great group of girls. The campus is very active. The Recreation Center is always busy and there are a lot of sports and Intramurals to get involved in. As soon as it gets warm out, people are doing things outside. The nature is beautiful. It is very common for students to hike the bluffs on the weekends for fun to see the beautiful view. Students can rent roller blades and take a trail by the marsh for recreation. There's always something to do or get involved in at La Crosse Am learning a lot The classes are challenging. It is more difficult than high school, but I would assume that most colleges are. Most class sizes are relatively small. My chemistry lab had only 18 students in it! The teachers are very helpful and want you to do well. They provide office hours, information about tutors, and are willing to meet with you if you need help. When I talk to students who are older than me, I can tell how much they have learned",
