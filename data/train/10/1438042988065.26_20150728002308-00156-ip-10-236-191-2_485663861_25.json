The results are shown in FIG. 2, wherein the error bars represent 1 SD.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{101241=In another embodiment of this invention, inhibitors which affect the affinity constants of the association of troponin I complexes or of troponin T complexes are added to the sample prior to or with formation of the reaction mixture so that the free troponin I or troponin T is measured, respectively. The binding inhibitors may disrupt the troponin complexes or they may open up or partially unravel the complex, such that some or all interactions between the troponin components are broken so that epitopes may be more easily assessable to the antibodies for binding. Inhibitors can be selected from the group of compounds which comprise, but is not limited to, metal chelating agents and peptides which compete with troponin I or troponin T for binding to proteins of the contractile apparatus. Metal chelating agents, particularly those which bind to calcium and Magnesium, lower the affinity constant, for example, of troponin I and troponin C binding by about a factor of 10 as compared to the affinity in the presence of calcium (Biochemistry 33, 12729-12734 (1994)). Peptides which affect troponin I and troponin T binding to proteins of the contractile apparatus include mastoparan, melittin and peptide sequences which mimic the troponin I and T sequences at their binding domains with the proteins of the contractile apparatus ((Biochemistry 31, 11326-11334 (1992), J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15715-15723(1992), Biochemistry 33, 8233-8239 (1994)). Other peptides which are useful as inhibitors are those which mimic the binding domains of the troponin components. The binding domains are described, for example, in Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 16, 535-559 (1987), and with the binding domain information, one skilled in the art synthesizes the peptide which mimics the peptide of the protein at the binding domain., 283233=The data show that the addition of melittin to the assay increases the assay response by about a factor of two, thus increasing assay sensitivity to troponin I. In data not shown, incorporation of protamine (at 0.03-0.1 mg/ml) and melittin (at 0.017-0.05 mM) into an immunoassay for troponin I that utilized latex particles increased the assay response by factors of 30% to 400%., 240672=Mice having high titers antibodies to the desired protein antigen (troponin I or troponin ternary complex) were sacrificed, and total RNA was purified from the spleen cells (Anal. Biochem. 162:156-159 (1987)). The total RNA (50 \u03bcg) from the spleen cells was used directly as template for Superscript\u2122 II reverse transcriptase (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) with oligo (dT)12 as the primer to make cDNA for PCR. A total of 32 PCR reactions was used to amplify the heavy chain variable regions using Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.), 3 \u03bcL cDNA per reaction, 32 different 5\u2032oligonucleotides and a single 3\u2032 oligonucleotide. The kappa chain variable regions were amplified similarly using 29 different 5\u2032 oligonucleotides and a single 3\u2032 oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotides were previously designed to ensure that nearly all antibody variable regions present in the spleen would be amplified with no more than 2 changes in the actual amino acid sequence caused by mismatches of the oligonucleotide with the cDNA based on a compilation of mouse antibody sequences. (Sequences of proteins of immunological interest. Vol. 2., 5th edition, 1991, Cambridge, Mass.) An aliquot of each double stranded PCR product was amplified a second time using only the 3\u2032 oligonucleotide to produce single stranded DNA (ss-DNA). The ss-DNA products from all of the kappa chain amplification reactions were pooled, and the ss-DNA products from all of the heavy chain reactions were pooled separately. The ss-DNA from each pooled sample was purified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and a Genpak Fax HPLC column (Waters Inc, Milford, Mass.). The purified ss-DNA was used to perform mutagenesis of an M13 uracil template following standard oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis techniques (J. Immunol. 149:3903-3913, 1992). The M13 template contains DNA sequences complementary to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the ss-DNA for both the heavy chain and the kappa chain variable regions. As a result, when the heavy chain and kappa chain variable regions were annealed to the M13 vector, a mixture of different antibody sequences was created. The resulting antibodies were expressed as Fab antibody fragments comprising the entire kappa chain and the variable region of the heavy chain linked to the first constant region of the heavy chain. Electrocompetent cells (DH12S Gibco BRL., Gaithersburg, Md.) were transformed by electroporation with the resultant M13 DNA. A typical electroporation of 500 ng M13 vector into 40 \u03bcL DH12S cells yielded 107 to 108 different antibody clones. The clones were further amplified to produce an antibody phage display library. The M13 vector was designed so that the heavy chain was expressed as a fusion protein with the major coat protein of M13, the gene VIII protein. There are approximately 2700 copies of the gene VIII protein on every phage particle. After the heavy chain/gene VIII fusion protein was secreted to the periplasm of E. coli, the secreted kappa chain binds to the heavy chain to form a functional antibody Fab fragment. This leads to the production of phage having functional antibodies on the surface of the phage with the, 57690=The generation and selection of antibodies that are preferentially either sensitive or insensitive to the binding of troponin I or T in binary complexes are accomplished by first preparing binary troponin I/T, T/C and I/C complexes from purified components (J. Biol. Chem. 254, 350-355 (1979), J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2534-2542 (1983), J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2951-2954 (1983), Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 63, 212-218 (1985), Biochemistry 33, 12729-12734 (1994), Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 16, 535-559 (1987)). The complexes may be stabilized, if necessary, by chemically cross-linking the proteins complex using methods familiar to those skilled in the art. The generation and selection of antibodies that are sensitive or insensitive to the binding of troponin I or T in the ternary complex can be accomplished several ways. For example, one way is to purify the ternary complex (Methods Enzymol. 85, 241-263 (1983)) or to reconstitute the complex using the purified troponin components. One skilled in the art will recognize that various other contractile apparatus proteins which may be associated with the binary or ternary complexes of troponins can also be constructed from the purified components and that the resultant complex can be utilized to generate and select antibodies as taught by the instant invention. The complex can be stabilized with respect to dissociation by chemically crosslinking the components. The purified complexes are then injected, for example, into mice or rabbits, to generate polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. Another way is to purify free (unbound) troponin I or T and then inject the purified free troponin I or T, for example, into mice or rabbits, to generate polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. One skilled in the art will recognize that many procedures are available for the production of antibodies, for example, as described in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Ed Harlow and David Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1988), Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that binding fragments or Fab fragments which mimic antibodies can also be prepared from genetic information by various procedures (Antibody Engineering: A Practical Approach (Borrebaeck, C., ed.), 1995, Oxford University Press, Oxford; J. Immunol. 149, 3914-3920 (1992)). In particular, the preparation, screening and selection of recombinant binding fragments is described in Examples 22 and 23., 39273=The term \u201cantibodies or receptor proteins\u201d as used herein refer to monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, binding fragments of antibodies, and receptor proteins that specifically bend to a target. In a preferred embodiment, receptor proteins, for example, antibodies or binding fragments, are directed to the epitopes of troponin I which are insensitive to the oxidation state of the molecule. The terms sensitive and insensitive herein refer generally to the ability of an antibody to recognize particular forms of free troponin or troponin complexes. In particular, a sensitive antibody which is useful in an immunoassay distinguishes one form or forms of troponin from another form and an insensitive antibody which is useful in an immunoassay does not distinguish one form or forms of troponin from another. The sensitivity or insensitivity of an antibody is exhibited in an immunoassay. To determine whether an antibody is sensitive or insensitive, the antibody is tested with each troponin form independently to yield the assay response of the antibody for each troponin form. In general, a preferred antibody that is insensitive to the troponin form will yield an assay response that is the same, within about a factor of two and preferably within 20%, for each form of troponin. A preferred antibody that is sensitive to the troponin form will yield an assay response that is at least a factor of two, and preferably a factor of five, larger for one form or group of forms as compared with the other form(s). In addition, the terms \u201ctroponin I and T\u201d can refer to the free, uncomplexed troponins or to the troponins in the binary or ternary complexes. Human cardiac troponin I contains two cysteines, at positions 80 and 97 (FEBS Letters, 270, 57-61 (1990)). In the current art, during the purification of troponin I from tissues, the oxidation state of troponin I is directed toward the reduced form using various reductants, including mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol and the like (Can. J. Biochem. 54, 546-553 (1976), Methods Enzymol. 85, 241-263 (1982)). After purification, the current art also teaches to maintain troponin I in the reduced form to prevent intermolecular disulfide formation (J. Biol. Chem 258, 2951-2954 (1983))., 288537=Oxidized Human cardiac troponin I (Bio-tech International) and Human cardiac troponin ternary complex (Bio-tech International) were spiked into blood or plasma and assayed in an immunoassay device (such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,852) in which the blood or plasma samples passed through a blood filter membrane (as described, e.g., in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/704,804, filed 26 Aug. 1996) that contained various amounts of troponin C., 289017=Blood filters (Ahlstrom; approx. 1.5\ufffd1.5\ufffd0.06 cm) were prepared by adding 150 \u03bcl of an aqueous solution of troponin C (Bio-Tech International; either purified from human heart or rabbit skeletal muscle), with or without calcium chloride, drying the filter for one hour at 45\ufffd C. and assembling them into the assay devices. The troponin C (50 \u03bcg/ml, human heart origin) was also added directly to some blood or plasma samples containing 0-20 ng/ml troponin I. The blood or plasma samples were added to the sample addition chamber of the devices which housed the blood filter. In the case of blood samples, the filter separated the red blood cells from plasma (as described, e.g., in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/704,804, filed 26 Aug. 1996). The plasma (from the blood or plasma samples) passed from the blood filter into a reaction chamber by capillary action. The reaction chamber contained dried reagents that were reconstituted by the plasma to form a reaction mixture., 223235=Oxidized cardiac troponin I (air oxidized, Example 4, University of Birmingham) at 100 ng/ml final concentration in human serum (Hybritech, Inc., San Diego) was incubated either with or without 100 ug/ml human cardiac troponin C (Bio-tech International, Inc.) at room temperature for 30 minutes. Two filter membranes, a CytoSep filter (Ahlstrom Filtration, Mount Holly Springs, Pa.) and a glass fiber filter (GB-100R, Micro Filtration Systems, Dublin, Calif.) were cut into rectangles measuring 1.5 cm by 3.0 cm and were secured to a transparency film (catalog #pp2500, 3M, Austin, Tex.) by a piece of tape across the filters. The troponin I solution with and without troponin C (300 \u03bcl) were applied slowly to the top of the filters at one end and the solution migrated through the filter to the far end by wicking action. About 15 \u03bcl of solution was collected from the far end with a plastic pipet tip. The collected solutions were diluted by factors of 20, 40 and 80 in assay buffer and assayed using Protocol A, Example 2 with TRI-7 F81 anti troponin I conjugate and biotinylated anti troponin I peptide 3 specific antibodies. Aliquots of the troponin I solutions with and without troponin C that had not been passed through the filters were also assayed and used to construct a standard curve from which the concentration of troponin I in the solution that had passed through the membrane was determined. The calculated concentration was divided by 100 ng/ml to obtain the fraction of recovered troponin I shown in Table 10. The experimental errors given in Table 10 represent one standard deviation., 24682=Troponin I and troponin T have recently been shown to be more specific than CKMB for diagnosing myocardial infarction (Circulation 83, 902-912 (1991), Clin. Chem. 40, 1291-1295 (1994). Although troponin T has some disadvantages as a marker because it is elevated in patients experiencing renal disease (Clin. Chem. 41, 312-317 (1995)), the inventive methods herein disclose the successful use of troponin T as a diagnostic marker. The use of troponin I as a diagnostic marker for myocardial infarction also appears to meet many of the clinical requirements (Clin. Chem. 40, 1291-1295 (1994), Clin. Chem. 41, 312-317 (1995))., 50646=The clinical impact of an immunoassay measuring only the free troponin I or T from a patient experiencing a myocardial infarction can be very significant. Since the binding of troponin I and T to troponin components in the blood will be variable, depending on the troponin component concentrations, and on the time that has elapsed since the release of the troponin components from muscle an analysis of the bound and free form of the troponin I and T in the blood must be considered. For example, the binding affinity troponin I to troponin C, in the presence of calcium (which also is present in blood) is 1.27\ufffd108 M\u22121 (Biochemistry 33, 12729-12734 (1994)). This implies that if the troponin C concentration is 100 ng/ml and the total (bound and free) troponin I concentration is 8 ng/ml, then the free concentration of troponin I is calculated to be 4.6 ng/ml. If the concentration of troponin I which is indicative of a myocardial infarction is 5 ng/ml or greater, then an assay which measures only the free form of troponin I, in this case, 4.6 ng/ml, will indicate to the physician that a myocardial infarction has not taken place. Generally, in hospital emergency departments which admit patients believed to have had a myocardial infarction, a blood sample from the individual will be obtained again in an hour or two if the first result is negative. In this example, the patient, having a total troponin I concentration of 8 ng/ml in the first sample, (which is defined as positive for a myocardial infarction), but only a measured concentration of 4.6 ng/ml, (which would be defined as a negative result), would not be treated and would continue to accrue damaged heart muscle during the time before a second sample was analyzed. Interpretation of results of troponin T assays would also suffer from troponin T binding to components of the contractile apparatus in blood. Thus, immunoassays of the current art that measure the free troponin I and T may not correctly diagnose a myocardial infarction when the troponin I or T concentration, respectively, is near the decision point. In some cases, the rise or fall of the troponin I or T concentration in a patients blood over time as determined by analyzing blood samples drawn at several different times might be used to diagnose the dynamic condition of the heart, for example, to determine whether the damaged heart is improving with therapy or continuing to deteriorate. In these cases, the time-course of the free troponin I or T concentration could be different than that of the total troponin (bound and free) concentration. One skilled in the art will realize that increasing concentrations of all the troponin components in the blood will result in an increasing fraction of bound troponin I and T relative to free troponin. The concentration of total troponin (bound and free) may rise faster than the concentration of free troponin I and T. An assay that measures the total troponin concentration (bound and free troponin I and T) would be more accurate in assessing progression of heart damage as compared with an assay that measures only free troponin I or T., 23488=During a myocardial infarction, heart muscle cells die and release their contents to the blood stream. The CKMB is released among such cellular components. CKMB becomes elevated above an otherwise nominal value and can be diagnostic for myocardial infarction. The specificity of CKMB for diagnosing myocardial infarction is not 100% because another source of CKMB in the body is skeletal muscle. Since the mass of skeletal muscle in the body far exceeds the mass of cardiac muscle, through the normal catabolic turnover of skeletal muscle cells, the blood concentration of CKMB in healthy individuals will vary. In general, the concentration of CKMB which may be indicative of myocardial infarction is above 5-7 ng/ml (Circulation 87, 1542-1550 (1993), Clin. Chem. 39, 1725-1728 (1993)). The CKMB concentration of individuals who have skeletal muscle injury or who have exercised has been reported to be elevated above 9 ng/ml (Clin. Chem. 38, 2396-2400 (1992)). Therefore, the problem of specificity when using CKMB as a marker for myocardial infarction has prompted the search for other more specific markers which are released only from damaged heart muscle., 286766=For improving the recovery of troponin I, useful concentrations of troponin C and/or troponin T that are applied to various surfaces are from 1 ng/ml to 1 mg/ml, preferably in the presence of 0-1000 mole equivalents of calcium or magnesium. The applied solutions may or may not be dried, depending on the application of the technique utilizing an improved recovery. The actual mass of troponin C and/or I necessary for improved recoveries is related to the surface area of the medium that is in contact with the troponin I sample. Filters, membranes, bibulous materials and latex particles, for example, have a larger relative surface area than the surface of a smooth vessel, for example, and one skilled in the art will recognize that a larger mass of troponin C and/or T would be necessary for maximum recoveries., 228414=A blood filter (CytoSep 1.5 cm\ufffd3.0 cm) was soaked for 16 hours at room temperature in solutions of deionized water containing 1 mg/ml of the proteins listed in Table 11. The filters were rinsed once with deionized water and dried for 2 hours at 35 C. Oxidized human cardiac troponin I (Bio-tech International, Inc.) at 100 ng/ml in human serum (Hybritech, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) also containing 2 mM added calcium chloride was passed through the filters as described in Example 18. The amount of troponin I recovered from the filters was determined by assay (Protocol B, Example 2) using TRI-7 F81 anti-troponin I and biotinylated anti troponin I peptide 4 specific antibodies with added binding inhibitors (Example 11). The data in Table 11 are expressed as the fraction of troponin I recovered, which was determined as described in Example 18., 26567=The conformations of troponin I, T and C change upon binding when forming binary and ternary complexes (Biochemistry 33, 12800-12806 (1994), J. Biol. Chem. 254, 350-355 (1979), Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 16, 535-559 (1987)). An understanding of the conformational changes of troponin I and troponin T and the heterogeneity of the proteins in the blood is critical for the development of accurate diagnostic procedures for measuring troponin I and troponin T concentrations. In addition, troponin I is reported to be unstable in blood (Direction Insert for Troponin I Immunoassay, Sancfi/ERIA Diagnostics Pasteur, Marnes la Coquette, France), and the mechanisms responsible for the instability have not been understood. This invention addresses these problems and provides for stable troponin I and T compositions which are useful in immunoassays., 290022=The reagents included a conjugate consisting of fluorescent energy transfer latex (FETL) particles, (for example particles such as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/409,298, filed 23 Mar. 1995), and recombinant anti-troponin I antibodies #4 and #57 (see Example 23). The FETL-antibody conjugate was prepared by standard protein conjugation techniques familiar to those skilled in the art (e.g., reacting SMCC with latex particles containing amines and thereafter reacting antibody-thiol (prepared by reaction of SPDP and antibody, with latex particle-SMCC to form an antibody conjugate, as outlined in the Pierce Chemical Co. 1994, p. T166 and T192, and methods described in Uniform Latex Particles, Seradyn Inc., Indianapolis, Ind., p. 31-40; and also methods described in Microparticle Reagent Optimization, Seradyn Inc., p. 91-97). The reagents also included biotinylated Goat anti-troponin I peptide 3 specific polyclonal antibody, which formed complimentary pairs with conjugate antibodies #4 and #57 that were not sensitive to whether troponin I was free, in a binary I/C, I/T or ternary I/C/T complex., 26238=The troponin complex in muscle is tightly bound to the contractile apparatus. Approximately 6% of the troponin T in cardiac tissue exists as an unbound protein in the cytoplasm and it is believed that this pool of troponin T is released from damaged muscle (Am. J. Cardiol. 67, 1360-1367 (1991))., 56215=In another preferred embodiment, antibodies or binding fragments are directed to epitopes which are not changed by proteolytic degradation of the N-terminal region of troponin I. The conformation of troponin I is also reported to be affected by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (Biophys. J. 63, 986-995(1992), Biochem. 33, 12729-12734 (1954)). In another preferred embodiment, antibodies or binding fragments are directed to epitopes of either troponin I or troponin complexes, which are or are not changed by the phosphorylation state of troponin I. Troponin I can be phosphorylated using methods described in J. Biol. Chem. 252, 851-857 (1977). The phosphorylated and dephosphorylated preparations of troponin I can be utilized as immunogens for generating antibodies as well as antigens for the selection of antibodies to the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated troponin I. The troponin complex can be dissociated into the component proteins using various treatments, including high concentrations of urea, low pH and metal chelating agents which bind divalent metal cations, particularly calcium and magnesium (Methods Enzymol. 85, 241-263 (1982)). These treatments are, in general, very harsh and require several hours. Thus, these conditions for dissociating the troponin complex are not practical for immunoassays which must be performed in a matter of minutes on samples from individuals who may be suffering a myocardial infarction., 25339=The troponin complex in muscle is comprised of troponin I, C and T. These troponin components axis: as various tissue specific isoforms. Troponin C exists as two isoforms, one from cardiac and slow-twitch muscle and one from fast-twitch muscle. Troponin I and T are expressed as different isoforms in slow-twitch, fast-twitch and cardiac muscle (Biochem. J. 171, 251-259 (1978), J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21247-21253 (1990), Hum. Genet. 88, 101-104 (1991), Circul. Res. 69, 1226-1233 (1991)). The unique cardiac isoforms of troponin I and T allow them to be distinguished immunologically from the other troponins of skeletal muscle. Therefore, the release into the blood of troponin I and T from damaged heart muscle has been related to cases of unstable angina and myocardial infarction. The prior art, however, has not addressed other forms of troponin I and T in blood., 20003=This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser.
