            "Description",
            "SENSOR-BASED MOBILE SEARCH, RELATED METHODS AND SYSTEMS - A smart phone senses audio, imagery, and/or other stimulus from a user's environment, and acts autonomously to fulfill inferred or anticipated user desires. In one aspect, the detailed technology concerns phone-based cognition of a scene viewed by the phone's camera. The image processing tasks applied to the scene can be selected from among various alternatives by reference to resource costs, resource constraints, other stimulus information (e.g., audio), task substitutability, etc. The phone can apply more or less resources to an image processing task depending on how successfully the task is proceeding, or based on the user's apparent interest in the task. In some arrangements, data may be referred to the cloud for analysis, or for gleaning. Cognition, and identification of appropriate device response(s), can be aided by collateral information, such as context. A great number of other features and arrangements are also detailed.",

            "SMARTPHONE-BASED METHODS AND SYSTEMS - One arrangement concerns a portable device (e.g., a smartphone) that executes plural recognition agents, such as agents that perform fingerprint-based object recognition, fingerprint-based audio recognition, barcode reading, watermark decoding, etc. Each of the agents reads from and writes to a blackboard data structure, to which camera and microphone sensors also post their data. Queues of stored sensor data are thus available for the agents to process. In some arrangements, the agents also post\u2014to the blackboard\u2014estimates of the resource costs required to perform certain functions, and estimates of the quality of results that may be achieved by such functions. This allows the system to make informed decisions about how to deploy the device's limited resources (battery, processing cycles, network bandwidth, etc.). A great variety of other features and arrangements are also detailed."

Shaw, Portland, OR US Glen David Shaw, Conway, AR US Patent application number Description Published 20090170360 Sealed compression type coaxial cable F-connectors - Axially compressible, self-sealing, high bandwidth F-connectors for conventional hand tools for interconnection with coaxial cable. An internal, dual segment sealing grommet activated by compression provides a seal. Each connector has a rigid nut that is rotatably secured to a, tubular body. A rigid, conductive post coaxially extends through the connector. A post barbed end penetrates the cable within the connector. A tubular, metallic end cap is slidably fitted to a body shank, and thereafter forcibly compressed lengthwise during installation. The end cap has a ring groove for seating the enhanced grommet. The end cap can irreversibly assume any position, being held by end cap teeth. A tactile system comprising external convex projections on the body complemented by a resilient, external O-ring on the end cap aids installers who can properly position connectors with the sense of touch. 07-02-2009 20090176407 Compression type coaxial cable F-connectors - Axially compressible, high bandwidth F-connectors designed for conventional installation hand tools for interconnection with coaxial cable.
