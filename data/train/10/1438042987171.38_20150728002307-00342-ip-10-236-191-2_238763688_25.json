I will try to revise, and would gladly answer questions. So, the numbers in parentheses in the final score? That's the final score adjusted to Win Value. You can use that difference, in combination with the individual player's WVs, to more accurately assess the player's responsible for the win or loss, and I plan to use that data for assigning ERV win and loss from here on out. (Thanks to Dexys for that idea). Think of it this way -- runs are the currency with which teams buy wins. Like currency, runs have different values at different times. A solo home run in the first in a 1-0 final is worth a lot more than an grand slam in the ninth of a 10-0 game. WV seeks to adjust the runs' value for inflation, based on how much it will cost to win the game. 4. Win Value -- This column takes the RVs (all of them, Batting, Fielding, Running, Pitching, etc.) and adjusts",

No panic in this team, they seem to let the opponent score early to lull them into their trap. The pitching matchups are set up well for the Nats -- no Glavine or Pedro this weekend for the Mets. If Zach Day can pitch like he did Monday night versus the Phils, and Patterson continues his commanding performance, a sweep could be had. Guzman had a share of the ERV win until",
