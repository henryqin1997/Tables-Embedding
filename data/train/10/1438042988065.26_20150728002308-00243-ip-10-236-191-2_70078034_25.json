Instead, use deleteWCPSCMISConnection, deleteWCPSActivityGraphConnection, deleteWCPSPeopleConnection, or deleteWCPSCustomConnection. If you use deleteConnection to delete a WSRP or PDK-Java producer connection (instead of using deregisterWSRPProducer or deregisterPDKJavaProducer), unused secondary connections will remain, which you might want to remove.
