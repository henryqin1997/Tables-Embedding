To enable the flight of the projectile to be seen, a tracer may be fitted into the base. A tracer consists of a small tube or disc filled with tracer composition, which is ignited when the gun fires. The igniter is a device to ensure self-destruction of the shell if the fuze has not operated by a given time. The tracer and igniter is a similar device combining the functions of tracer and self destruction. COLOURING AND MARKING ON PROJECTILES. Plate 19. 202.
