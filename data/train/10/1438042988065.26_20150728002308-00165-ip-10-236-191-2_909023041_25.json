            "Campus police are always driving around and making sure that everything is going as it should and you can always have and officer escort you to your dorm if you feel uneasy about walking there by yourself.",
            "On campus there is always something to whether you just want to hang in the POD or down in the basement playing pool, bowing, or all sorts of video games. Also there are always intramural games going on that you can get a team together and compete in.",
            "The Cafe is actually really good. There are plenty of varieties in food from the grill to the sandwich line you will always find something you like. On top of that the desserts are the bomb.",
            "Dorm life is the best! You meet so many people and have fun movie nights and cook outs. The dorms them self are nice and very clean, no bugs. Some complain that some of the dorms are too small but I believe they are all a good size.",
            "Academics are very important here at HSU including to coaches. As every other school you have your hard classes and your easy classes but all the classes are well taught and professors are always willing to help you in anyway they can.",
            "Apply as early as possible to get more scholarship opportunities because the school is pretty expensive. Also be sure to sign up for New Student Orientation (NSO) and participate in all its' events you will not regret it.",
            "Hardin-Simmons is a great Christian University with many great professors and advisors who want nothing more than to see you succeed. HSU has a beautiful campus and tons of places outside that you can sit under a tree and study and it is so relaxing. Also the other students are great and are always there when you need something."
