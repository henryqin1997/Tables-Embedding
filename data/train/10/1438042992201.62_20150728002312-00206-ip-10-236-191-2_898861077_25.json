They are nice with the option of having your own room for a fee of course. They are suite styles with one bath. So, two bedrooms with a bath and shower in between that they share. There is no kitchen area, but most people eat in the Cafeteria. It's a great place to build relationships and meet new life long relationships.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Coming from Seattle, the tuition at the other schools I considered was the same or more than the tuition plus room and board at Evangel. It is about 20,000 a year for tuition, room and board. Which makes it one of the most affordable private colleges. In addition, Evangel has many scholarships that students can apply for and a helpful financial aid team that will quickly answer any questions. Am enjoying being here There are so many activities, sports, and ways to get involved. Living in the dorm provides a sense of community and there are always things going on. People are friendly and it is an easy adjustment from high school to college. Am learning a lot There are more than 100 graduate programs and with an average class size of 25 (many of my classes are smaller) you are able to have a lot of interaction with the professors.
