For ICD calls, a call is abandoned if it is not answered by an agent and the caller hangs up or is disconnected. For IVR calls, a call is abandoned if it does not get past the workflow step that sets the handled flag. If a call has more than one leg that is abandoned (for example, an IVR call that is processed by different applications), each abandoned leg is displayed in this report. The Abandoned Call Detail Activity Report can include this chart: Note\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a report shows date and time information for an event or an activity, that date and time is the Cisco CRA server date and time. A table describing each filter parameter, if any, that is available for the report. You can use a filter parameter to limit information that appears in a report. For more information about filtering a report, see the \"Detailed Report Settings\" section. A table describing each sort criterion that is available for the report. For more information about sorting a report, see the \"Detailed Report Settings\" section. A table describing each field in the tabular section of the report.
