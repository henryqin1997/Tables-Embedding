    "textBeforeTable": "Data for Figure 1: Panel A - Inflation The figure plots inflation and the output gap that the conservative central bank implements under several scenarios. The figure plots the case of objective changes and limited commitment (continuous line), objective changes and discretion (dotted line), no objective changes and limited commitment (dashed-dotted line), and no objective changes and full commitment (dashed line). Figure 1:\u00a0\u00a0Adoption of liberal objectives: Optimal Inflation and Output under a conservative central bank --> . For the remaining parameters, we used a standard calibration of the model, with , , and .14 For comparison, we also plot the allocations prevailing under full-commitment and under limited commitment. When there is the possibility that more liberal objectives are adopted (solid line), in the first period there is a 0.25% increase in (annualized) inflation and a .5% reduction in output with respect to the standard case with full-commitment and no possibility of policy changes (dashed line). More importantly, the reduction in output is even bigger at a longer horizon, reaching a level of about 1.5%. From the picture, it is also clear that most of the effects are due to the changes in objectives, rather than to the associated",
