            "METHOD FOR DRIVING SURFACE EMITTING SEMICONDUCTOR LASER, OPTICAL TRANSMISSION MODULE, AND HANDHELD ELECTRONIC DEVICE - Provided is a method for driving a surface emitting semiconductor laser including an active region that generates light, a resonator structure disposed such that it sandwiches the active region, and a driving electrode that provides power to the active region. The surface emitting semiconductor laser has an internal resistance defined by voltage and current applied to the driving electrode. The method includes applying a modulation signal to the driving electrode, in which the modulation signal has a current amplitude defined by a first current value and a second current value that is greater than the first current value. The modulation signal is in a negative gradient region in which the internal resistance decreases in contrast to the increase of the current.",

A gap between the first light-emitting area and the second light-emitting area extends at an angle with respect to the first direction, and a portion of the first light-emitting area and a portion of the second light-emitting area overlap each other in the first direction.",
            "IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS, FIXING DEVICE, AND DRYING DEVICE - An image forming apparatus includes an image forming device forming an image on a recording medium; and a light source that, after the image has been formed by the image forming device, irradiates the recording medium with light to fix the image on the recording medium, while the recording medium moves relatively in a predetermined movement direction. The light source includes a current supply section, a light emitting section, and a current output section. Current for light emission is supplied to the current supply section. The light emitting section includes light emitting elements that are disposed two-dimensionally. At least the light emitting elements provided side by side in the movement direction are electrically connected in parallel. The current output section outputs the current that has passed through the light emitting section. The current supply section and the light emitting section are provided side by side in the movement direction.",
            "LIGHT GUIDING MEMBER, LIGHT EMITTING DEVICE, STATIC ELIMINATING DEVICE, AND IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS - A light guiding member includes a first end portion including an incident surface on which light emitted from a light source is incident; an emitting surface that extends in such a direction as to be at an angle to the incident surface, the emitting surface emitting the light that has been emitted from the light source and that has entered from the incident surface to a target object; and a second end portion including a reflection portion and a refraction portion, the reflection portion having a reflection surface that reflects the light that has entered from the incident surface in a direction away from the emitting surface, the refraction portion reflecting the reflected light that has been reflected by the reflection surface toward the incident surface and then refracting the light toward the emitting surface."

A compound represented by the formula (I) 07-14-2011 Shigeyuki Ueno, Kanagawa JP Patent application number Description Published 20090085626 Semiconductor integrated circuit and method for controlling semiconductor integrated circuit - When a master circuit is in an inactive state, a slave circuit assigned to the master circuit is not used. Accordingly, the use efficiency of system recourses is decreased. To solve the above problem, a semiconductor integrated circuit reassigns a M2 region of a slave circuit, previously assigned to a first master circuit, to a second master circuit. That is to say, the M2 region of the slave circuit previously assigned to the first master circuit is reassigned to the second master circuit based on the operational status of the first master circuit. This improves the use efficiency of system resources of the semiconductor integrated circuit. 04-02-2009 20130013831 SEMICONDUCTOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING SEMICONDUCTOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT",
