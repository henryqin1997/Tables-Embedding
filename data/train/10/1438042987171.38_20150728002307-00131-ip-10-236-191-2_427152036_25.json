When he was called into England's one-day squad for the 2003 NatWest Series against South Africa and Zimbabwe, a dashing left-hander who had made his name with some aggressive innings in first-class cricket, rarely a day went by without reference to his grandfather, Patrick, who starred as Dr Who on BBC Television in the 1960s. Despite impressing in the field, he struggled with the bat and made a highest score of just 20 in six games. He was never selected again., 59562=Jun 18, 2015}",
