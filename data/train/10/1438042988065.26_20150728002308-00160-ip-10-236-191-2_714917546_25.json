He knew next to nothing about the sport when he took a temporary job with the 1994 World Cup organizing committee. He just wanted to do some sports-related work before he enrolled in business school at UCLA. \u201cSoccer wasn\u2019t part of my long-term plan,\u201d Sternberg said. But over the past two decades, Sternberg has spent the majority of his career working around soccer \u2014 first at Fox Sports, later at Fox Soccer Channel, and now as the head of media at Manchester United. He\u2019s one of dozens of people who worked on the 1994 World Cup who continue to work in the sport. Their professional involvement in the sport is a testament to the growth of the soccer business in the U.S. over the last two decades., 89578=\u00a9 2015 American City Business Journals.

Ad Choices., 43227=At a conference table in New York in January, Howard Handler and a team of Major League Soccer marketing executives came to the conclusion that the 2014 MLS season must be linked to this year\u2019s FIFA World Cup in Brazil. \u201cFor Club and Country,\u201d the league\u2019s slogan for the current season, was hatched. The following day, Handler, MLS\u2019s chief marketing officer, traded emails from his laptop on a flight from New York to Los Angeles with David Bruce, the league\u2019s senior director of brand and integrated marketing. Thoughts on how the theme would look and be used were refined. \u201cIt just kind of made sense,\u201d Handler said. \u201cThe World Cup is the greatest locomotive you could ever imagine. It always creates a seminal moment for soccer, and MLS players form the nucleus of the U.S. team and are key components of other national teams.\u201d}",
