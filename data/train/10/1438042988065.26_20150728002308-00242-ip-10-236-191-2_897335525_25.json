Even when my high school came to Concordia to participate in the Choral Festival, I distinctly remember feeling completely at home on the campus.

If you don't go to class you're not going to get the grades. Tips for prospective students Be sure to find something to do on campus. there are so many groups on campus it's almost overwhelming, but once you find something stick with it. If you can't find something from the vast list of activities you can always make your own club. Bang for the buck The dinning services was nominated for there buffet style facility. The teachers do their jobs, and the custodial staff keeps everything in working order. In coming to Concordia you are paying for quality. Am enjoying being here The students and staff on Concordias campus are warm and welcoming. The Campus",
