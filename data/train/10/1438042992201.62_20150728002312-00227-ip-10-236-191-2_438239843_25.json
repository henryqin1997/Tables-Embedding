            "OPTICAL ARTICLE AND METHOD OF MAKING - Disclosed herein is an optical article having a top layer with a structured surface that collimates light, a core layer secured to the top layer opposite the structured surface, and a bottom layer secured to the core layer opposite the top layer. Either the top layer or the core layer includes a first extrudable polymer having a flexural modulus of greater than 2.5 GPa, and the other layer includes a second extrudable polymer having a flexural modulus of 2.5 GPa or less, an impact strength of greater than about 40 J/m, and tensile elongation at break of greater than about 5%. The bottom layer includes a third extrudable polymer. The bottom layer of the optical article may be structured to diffuse light. One or two optical articles may be secured to an optical film such as a polarizer film. Methods and display devices are also disclosed herein.",
            "METHODS OF MAKING STRUCTURED FILMS - Structured films having acoustical absorbance properties are disclosed. Methods of making and using the structured films are also disclosed.",
            "STRUCTURED FILMS HAVING ACOUSTICAL ABSORBANCE PROPERTIES - Structured films having acoustical absorbance properties are disclosed. Methods of making and using the structured films are also disclosed.",
            "OPTICAL FILMS WITH INTERNALLY CONFORMABLE LAYERS AND METHOD OF MAKING THE FILMS - A co-extrusion method for making a replicated film. The method includes the steps of providing at least three materials and co-extruding them between a nip roll and a structured roll. The materials include a backside layer material, a core layer material, and a replicated layer material. The structured roll has a surface structure that is replicated onto the replicated layer, and the core layer is an internally conformable layer that conforms with the replicated layer.",
            "OPTICAL FILM REPLICATION ON LOW THERMAL DIFFUSIVITY TOOLING WITH CONFORMAL COATING - A system and method for extrusion replication of microstructures to make microreplicated optical films. The system includes press roll and a replicating member. The replicating member includes a low thermal diffusivity material having a microreplicated outer surface or an organic material having a microreplicated outer surface. An inorganic conformal coating is disposed over the patterned outer surface of the organic or low thermal diffusivity material.",
            "MICROSTRUCTURED TAPE - Herein is disclosed a plastic tape, comprising a backing with a first major side comprising a microstructured paint-retention pattern and a second major side that may comprise a microstructured hand-tear pattern and with a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer disposed on second major side of the backing; wherein the backing, the microstructured paint-retention pattern, and the microstructured hand-tear pattern (if present) all constitute a monolithic plastic unit.",
            "Profiled Extrusion Replication - A profiled extrusion replication process is disclosed that includes steps of (a) extruding a molten material through an extrusion die having at least one profiled die lip to form a molten extrudate having first and second major extrudate surfaces and having a first structural feature in the first major extrudate surface; (b) bringing the molten extrudate into contact with a tool surface comprising one or more second structural features so as to cause a portion of the first structural feature in the first major extrudate surface to contact the one or more second structural features on the tool surface; and (c) cooling the molten extrudate to provide the structured film. Structured films and apparatus for making structured films are also disclosed.",
            "STRUCTURED LAMINATION TRANSFER FILMS AND METHODS - Lamination transfer films and methods for transferring a structured layer to a receptor substrate. The transfer films include a carrier substrate having a releasable surface, a sacrificial template layer applied to the releasable surface of the carrier substrate and having a non-planar structured surface, and a thermally stable backfill layer applied to the non-planar structured surface of the sacrificial template layer. The sacrificial template layer is capable of being removed from the backfill layer, such as via pyrolysis, while leaving the structured surface of the backfill layer substantially intact.",
            "MASKING TAPE WITH MULTI-DIRECTIONAL HAND TEAR - A hand-tearable masking tape with a primary microstructured hand-tear pattern and at least one secondary hand-tear pattern oriented so that the tape exhibits multi-directional tear."

Clarke, Woodbury, MN US 06-07-2012 Beverage Dispensing Device - A beverage dispenser that is enabled for on demand, gravity fed dispensing of a pre-mixed or otherwise ready to drink beverage that has been thermally regulated through natural convection. More specifically, the beverage dispenser enables pre-mixed or otherwise ready to drink beverage containers (i.e., beverage containers with beverage contents that are pre-mixed or otherwise ready to drink) to be installed on the beverage dispenser and, without the aid of electricity or electro-mechanical devices, dispense a thermally regulated beverage on-demand to an intended customer. The beverage dispenser may comprise a thermal regulation compartment that facilitates regulating the temperature of beverage contents through natural convection. The beverage dispenser may also comprise a thermally regulated and thermally insulated beverage enclosure in which to install the beverage containers. The thermal regulation compartment may be carried within the beverage enclosure. 20120138635 Published Description Patent application number Georgina Louise Clarke, Brooklyn, NY US 10-18-2012 Method and system to evaluate and trade a liability for an uncertain tax position - Method and system to provide an exchange to enable trading of liability for uncertain tax positions between a taxpayer and a counterparty. The exchange provides risk assessments and operates as a market maker to consummate bids and acceptance thereof over a network. The method comprises obtaining over a network an indication of the valuation risk associated with the taxpayer's position; recalculating",
