The methods can be used to diagnose a patient's health state, or change in health state, or for diagnosing risk of developing or the presence of pancreatic cancer. The method comprises analyzing a sample from a patient to obtain quantifying data for one or more than one of the metabolite markers; comparing the quantifying data to corresponding data obtained for one or more than one reference sample to identify abnormalities in the level of the metabolite marker(s) in the sample; and making a diagnosis if an abnormality is observed. Standards and kits for carrying out the method are also described. 20120202188 Published Description Patent application number",
