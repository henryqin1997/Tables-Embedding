On August 8, 2014, the FAA issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) prohibiting flight operations in the ORBB FIR at all altitudes, subject to certain limited exceptions, due to the armed conflict in Iraq. This amendment to SFAR No. 77 incorporates the flight prohibition set forth in the August 8, 2014, NOTAM into the rule. The FAA is also revising the approval process for this SFAR for other U.S. Government departments, agencies, and instrumentalities, to align with the approval process established for other recently published flight prohibition SFARs. This final rule will remain in effect for two years., 24709=The FAA is correcting a final rule technical amendment published on February 9, 2015 (80 FR 6899). In that final rule, which became effective on the date of publication, the FAA corrected errors in regulatory provisions addressing Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out equipment and use. The FAA inadvertently listed an incorrect Amendment Number for that final rule. This document corrects that error., 45742=Title 14 published on 2015-01-01, 33942=The FAA is correcting a final rule published on May 28, 2010. In that rule, the FAA amended its regulations by adding equipage requirements and performance standards for Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2014Broadcast (ADS-B) Out avionics on aircraft operating in Classes A, B, and C airspace, as well as other specified classes of airspace within the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). This document corrects errors in regulatory provisions addressing ADS-B Out equipment and use., 19004=This action extends the prohibition of flight operations within the Tripoli (HLLL) Flight Information Region (FIR) by all: U.S. air carriers; U.S. commercial operators; persons exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, except when such persons are operating a U.S.-registered aircraft for a foreign air carrier; and operators of U.S.-registered civil aircraft, except operators of such aircraft that are foreign air carriers. The extension of the expiration date is necessary to address a potential hazard to persons and aircraft engaged in such flight operations. Additionally, the FAA is amending the prohibition to make clear that operations by sub-contractors under a U.S. Government department, agency, or instrumentality's contract, grant, or cooperative agreement may be included in an approval request and to remove an obsolete reference to paragraph 8 of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1973. The FAA is also revising the approval conditions that will apply to operations authorized by other U.S. Government departments, agencies, and instrumentalities that are approved by the FAA, and the information about requests for exemption, to reflect the termination of statutory authorization for the FAA premium war risk insurance program.}",
