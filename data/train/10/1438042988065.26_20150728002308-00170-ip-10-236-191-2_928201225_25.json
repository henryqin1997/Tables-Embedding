            "Join a campus organisation!",
            "We've been ranked in the top 5 college cafeterias for several years now! While the food is healthy and the cafeteria workers are great, \u00c3\u00adt deos get old after a while, adn nothing is ever spicy",
            "Since everyone, or almost everyone, is in a dorm, they are great communities and a lot of fun! Your freshman dorm ends up being your St Olaf family in many ways.",
            "Classes are not easy, but professors are always there to offer some extra help or guidance.",
            "Bring warm clothes and an electric blanket! it's freeezing!",
            "St. olaf is a wonderful place to study! The community is very welcoming and fun, and you couldn't ask for better professors - they're engaged and available and genuinely want to help students."

Ole's, the nickname for those who are attending or have attended St. Olaf, are very willing to help one another whether in internships, advice, anything. For example, I received the opportunity to work as a student worker at a University of Kansas Medical Center research lab because I was able to contact an alum that is a senior researcher in the lab. If you want to gain experience in something, whether leadership or otherwise, opportunities on campus are abundant. You can join or create an organization for almost anything. St. Olaf is known for its study abroad programs in 46 different countries. One can study abroad for January Interim, a semester, or a whole year concentrating on almost any area of academics., 27402=Every December there is a large choir concert called Christmasfest. It is broadcast all over the country and everyone dons their Norwegian sweaters and attends for good music and Christmas carols. It is a tradition that it snows during Christmasfest - somehow it happens every year at least once that weekend!, 149480=Well, Jesse James Days is Northfield tradition commemorating the day the James-Elder Gang did not rob the bank. It is cowboy-themed, with a carnival and lots of events. St. Olaf's big tradition is Christmas Fest. Many of the students, music majors or not, participate in ensembles, and Christmas Fest has a national reputation for musical excellence. Over four performances in the beginning of December, the campus is beautifully decorated and swarming with people in Norwegian sweaters who come for the music and dinner of traditional Norwegian foods, including the dreaded lutefisk. Don't eat in the cafeteria every night of Fest- you will really hate ham and meatballs for a while otherwise, although no one could possibly get tired of lefse.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Campus Safety Campus is really safe, the only threat would be other students and people here seem to be kind-hearted. Greek Life There is no greek life. Clubs and Activities There are so many clubs and activities on campus there are sometimes not enough students to support them. If you want to get involved there are definitely opportunities. Great for these types of students Open-minded, questioning and curious students willing to live in a small community in a residential setting. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus There is a Norweigan, Lutheran heritage to the campus which comes out in events during Christmas Festival and heritage days. People flock to the campus in Norweigan sweaters to enjoy dinners of lutefisk and lefsa. During the normal school year though, it is like any other college campus and there are not an overwhelming amount of blonde hair and blue eyed students. Bang for the buck St. Olaf is one of the most expensive private colleges in MN. You do get a great education, but with the job market, make sure that the price of your",
