            "We have a really great campus safety team (which may be good or bad news to you) they offer a self-defense class for all freshmen and will escort student back to their dorm if needed. They're always there if you need them.",
            "The Greek life at Husson is alright. I was kind of disappointed that Husson has no Greek Row to speak of, but there are a couple sororities and fraternities, including Kappa Delta Phi (which is national) while the rest are campus specific.",
            "Husson has probably two or three dozen clubs of one kind or another, but I've had a little trouble finding out who to contact to join said clubs. If you miss the club fair (I had classes all day : ( ) then you're a little out of luck. There is a lot of variety in Husson's clubs, though. There's A Cappella, intramural sports, PrePharm Club, Science club, Habitat for Humanity, a couple LGBT clubs, improv, gaming, and many more. They're all listed here: http://www.husson.edu/club-directory",
            "Husson would be great for an average student who isn't interested in the hustle and bustle of a large university or one located in a large city, who prefers more personal attention in the classroom and a campus that only takes about seven minutes to walk across.",
            "None that I know of yet.",
            "I'm going for Pharmacy, and of the thirteen I applied to, Husson was by far the cheapest, especially without financial aid.",
            "This might disappoint, but Husson just isn't much of a party school. It is a dry campus, and the administration is pretty strict about underage drinking. In addition, there is no Greek Row at Husson, so there are fewer Greek-related activities. Most people drive to the University of Maine to have fun. However, if you're less into partying, then Husson's Student Activities does a great job of offering alternative activities. We've been able to go roller skating and bowling (both for free), and there is always some kind of music, presentation or movie playing in either the auditorium or the Gracie theater. In addition, they offer free Zumba and Yoga classes (if you find that fun, like I do) Husson is also located in a fairly large (by Maine standards) city, and Bangor has the Bangor Mall, some other shopping centers and lots of places to eat among other attractions.",
            "I love the food at Husson (freshman 15, here I come!). There are always at least three or four different options, plus a full salad bar, to essentially cater to most tastes, including vegetarian, gluten free, and usually vegan options. The Dining Hall staff are really friendly and do a great job. Naturally, every once in a while there is a night where you might find that there's nothing good in the Dining Center, but then you can get food at the Grab and Go (pizza, subs, etc) or at the Cressy Market (a mini market with all kinds of stuff, and they make good sandwiches).",
            "The dorms are fairly nice. Each one has nine floors, and most (if not all) are single-gender floors. There are also themed floors, such as a First-year experience floor, a quiet floor and a healthcare majors floor. Husson did just make a building specifically for graduate students to live in an apartment-based setting, but the original dorms are pretty average. Also, the internet can sometimes be iffy, but most students just have ethernet cables if they need them. There is free cable, though! (By free I mean covered by room and board :P)",
            "Although Husson is certainly not known for academic rigor, it really depends upon your ability as a student how rigorous Husson is. From my experience, teachers in general tend to be fairly understanding. I'm still a freshman in intro courses as well, so (as would be expected) the average student's perception of Husson's academic rigor will likely change as they take more advanced courses.",
            "Husson, as far as colleges go, is probably going to be your best option financially on the East Coast unless you receive a generous scholarship. In addition, many people love how small Husson is. Although it isn't as prestigious as many other universities, the students and faculty do make new students feel welcome. Although, Husson can be kind of a pain to deal with over the phone, so if you are able to visit the department you are calling in person, that is usually the better option.",
            "Husson University has a lovely, clean campus, with plenty of trees and other foliage. The food is pretty great too. Plus Husson has an impressive array of courses for business related majors and offers the comfort of a small campus."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Bang for the buck Husson also has an extensive financial aid and student accounts departments willing to help students get their school bills in order. They truly want you to succeed not only in your classes, but outside of college as well. Am enjoying being here In addition to classes, Husson also offers several clubs and organizations. They have everything from sororities and fraternities to a theatre group, an outdoors club, criminal justice and psychology clubs (as well as other clubs for each respective major), a pep band, and sports teams, including basketball, golf, football, lacrosse, softball, and baseball. Am learning a lot I am a criminal justice and psychology major at Husson and the professors and classes are simply the best available in New England. There has not been a single class in the criminal justice department I didn't like. The professors are intelligent and always willing to help students.
