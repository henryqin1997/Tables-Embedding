    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students This school is great for the type of young women who are timid and shy, and need to blossom into strong and confident women, ready to go out in the world on their own. Since all your classrooms will be filled with women only, you won't have the subconscious belief that the male is superior to you. There is this type of equality in Mills campus. Tips for prospective students I suggest you really look at their website and visit their campus since not most women are sure if an All-Womens school is beneficial to them. Bang for the buck To be honest, I got a Financial Aid Award of $46,318 (which $6,000 are suggested in loan) while the estimated cost of attendance is $52,706. Another $6,388 are left for me to pay on my own; in ONE year! $12,388 on my hands while being in a very low-income family of about $9,000 a year. I will have to sign up for other scholarships I believe. Will enjoy being here Well, there is a very diverse community surrounded by tall and luscious foliage. Every woman there will greet you, and they are very kind.",
