            "All datasets obtained by NGDC were converted to common horizontal and vertical datums of WGS 84 geographic and Mean High Water, respectively, using FME. They were also converted to common file format, ESRI point shapefiles, for visualization and inspection.",
            "Datasets were visually inspected with ArcGIS for identification and editing of data anomalies. Datasets were then compared with overlapping datasets to ensure data consistency.",
            "Multibeam sonar surveys were gridded to 1/3 arc-second spacing (~10 meters) using MB-System's 'mbgrid' tool. The resulting Arc ASCII grids were imported into ArcGIS.",
            "xyz files of the bathymetric data were surfaced using ESRI's ArcGIS onto a 10 arc-second grid that was then converted to an xyz file.",
            "xyz files for each input dataset were gridded using MB-System's 'mbgrid' tool, which utilizes a high-tension spline interpolation method to fill grid cells with no input elevation values. Preferential weighting was given to more recent, higher-accuracy datasets.",
            "The DEM was quantitatively evaluated by comparing with NGS geodetic monuments. It was visually evaluated by converting to UTM-zone coordinates (units of meters horizontally and vertically) and then creating a slope grid to identify gridding artifacts in the DEM."
