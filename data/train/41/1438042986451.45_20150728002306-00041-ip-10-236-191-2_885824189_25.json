Tips for prospective students Talk to everyone you can in admissions to see what you can get for scholarships. They truly are there to help! Bang for the buck Everything has been pretty reasonable, and out of everywhere I applied they offered me the biggest scholarship. Am enjoying being here I really enjoy the smaller school feeling. I love how the campus is outside and the exercise you get just walking from class to class. I enjoy all of the people there. Everyone is friendly. I feel like the majority of the professors really care about how you're doing. Am learning a lot I feel challenged everyday by the material itself and also by my professors to think outside the box.
