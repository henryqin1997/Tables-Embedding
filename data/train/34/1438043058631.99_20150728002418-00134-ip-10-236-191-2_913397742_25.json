            "LaGuardia has a cafeteria in every one of its four buildings, giving you a wide variety of choices. If that doesn't satisfy you, the neighborhood is filled with halal stands, breakfast stands, delis, a pizzeria, a 7-11, you name it. Food literally surrounds Laguardia.",
            "There are no dorms. Since it won't let me give zero stars, imagine that one star there, well, isn't there.",
            "If you're majoring in Criminology or Criminal Justice, ask about the CUNY Justice Academy, a program all the CUNY community colleges participate in. If you qualify, it guarantees you a seat in CUNY John Jay, a world leader in studies of law, Criminal justice, law enforcement and Forensics.",
            "LaGuardia offers a rich environment where one is bound to find like-minded peers. I have enjoyed my first 2 months here and enjoy my classes. This is a college for you."

Bang for the buck laguardia community college's unique semesters system save you money. they have a mini-session that lasts six weeks. if you have registered for the previous 12-week semester, then this mini-session is free. if stretches your money and helps you to graduate faster. What to do for fun i'm a non-traditional student so my opportunities for extracurricular activities are limited. laguardia community college offers lots of opportunities for fun. there is theater shows, and other activities that happens monthly on campus. Food and Dining i have visited the cafeteria on numerous occasions since it is very convenient. the prices are reasonable. the menu offers breakfast, lunch and even dinner. the food is actually very good. Academic Rigor i found the classes challenging and stimulating. you really need to apply yourself. you have to read your textbook and even do outside",
