It capped a memorable season in which he had also captained Lancashire's one-day side, notably leading them to a place at the Friends Life T20 finals day., 77507=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 58964=Sep 25, 2014, 57142=Jul 17, 2015, 53378=He made his first-class debut for the county in 2005 as one of the first Academy graduates to be awarded a professional contract. He made rapid progress, particularly in T20, in which he hit the last ball for six to snatch a win over Leicestershire in only his second appearance., 53701=By 2007 he had established himself in the Championship side and was the county's Young Player and senior Player of the Year in consecutive seasons, recording a maiden century against Nottinghamshire (122) in 2008. Venturing abroad, he helped Auckland Aces win the domestic championship in New Zealand in 2008-09. ESPNcricinfo staff, 73407=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 58011=May 15, 2015, 52777=|He was one of the few players to emerge with reputation largely unscarred from Lancashire relegations in 2012 and 2014 and extended his career-best in the latter season with 156 against the only side to finish below the Red Rose - Northamptonshire., 52300=In 2012 he scored 666 runs from 16 matches, including two centuries and two 50s, including a career best 154 not out against Surrey at Guildford in July, a week before his off-spin gained him career best bowling figures of 6 for 41 against Worcestershire at Old Trafford. He also finished among the leading batsmen in domestic one-day cricket in the country and was named in England's provisional 30-man squad for the 2012 World T20.}",
