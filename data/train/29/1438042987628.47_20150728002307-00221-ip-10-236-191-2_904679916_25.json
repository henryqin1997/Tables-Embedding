            "Students have a widespread lack of motivation and drive at this school which is very depressing, but common in a community college system that many people never progress beyond. This lack of drive and passion carries over to the teachers who just care about their paychecks and not much about the success of their students. If you are a student that actually plans to go somewhere in life, you will find yourself lost in a crowd of people doing nothing with themselves, but eventually you will get through it and transfer somewhere to get your degree."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students New students who know nothing about college. The counselors are genuinely interested in helping you transfer. They can help you when preparing your classes for next semester and can give you valuable information about the transferring process. If you like fog, diversity, thousand of restaurants or beaches, San Francisco is perfect for you. Tips for prospective students Make sure to take the Advanced Placement English Language and Literature as well as Calculus and score high on your SAT scores because a high score on these tests may exempt you from taking the math and English placement tests at city college. The exemption may make it quicker for you to be able to sign up for classes. For incoming freshmen I recommend to try to be exempt and if you can't then try to take the tests as soon as possible for you can get your scores, meet with a new student counselor and attend orientation to be able to sign up for classes early. The earlier you get to sign up for classes the better schedule you will have. Bang for the buck It's very affordable. It's $26 per unit, and if you get completed the FAFSA, qualify for financial aid and completed a rigorous high school education your total fees may be as low as",
