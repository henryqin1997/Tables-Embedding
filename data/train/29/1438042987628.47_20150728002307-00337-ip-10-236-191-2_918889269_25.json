In the rule, the FAA amended certain airworthiness regulations for transport category airplanes to eliminate regulatory differences between the airworthiness standards of the FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). It does not add new requirements beyond what manufacturers currently meet for EASA certification and does not affect current industry design practices. This final rule revises the pitch maneuver design loads criteria; revises the gust and turbulence design loads criteria; revises the application of gust loads to engine mounts, high lift devices, and other control surfaces; adds a \u201cround-the-clock\u201d discrete gust criterion and a multi-axis discrete gust criterion for airplanes equipped with wing-mounted engines; revises the engine torque loads criteria; adds an engine failure dynamic load condition; revises the ground gust design loads criteria; revises the criteria used to establish the rough air design speed; and requires the establishment of a rough air Mach number. This document corrects errors in the rule by ensuring that certain letters in the included equations have the right formatting and therefore the correct meaning., 77925=Title 14 published on 2015-01-01, 76800=\u00a7 2473 - Repealed.}",

Effective June 25, 2015. 14 CFR Part 25 Summary These special conditions are issued for the Boeing Model 747-8 series airplanes. These airplanes, as modified by L-3 Communications Integrated Systems (L-3 Communications), will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is therapeutic oxygen for medical use installed in an executive-interior airplane. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards. 80 FR 36470 - Special Conditions: Bombardier Aerospace Incorporated, Models BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 Series Airplanes; Electronic Flight-Control System (EFCS): Pitch-and Roll-Limiting Functions GPO FDSys XML | Text Additional Documents",
