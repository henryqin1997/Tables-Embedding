            "We have a full-time security person for our small campus. Many security cameras and several emergency stations that allow for a call to the police. A Marshall police officer also makes rounds on campus during the night. One of the things SGA is working on is establishing a full-time police department just for ETBU.",
            "I'm involved in Student Government Association where we have accomplished many things. The university cabinet is very open to our suggestions and proposals in making changes on our campus.",
            "I think people tend to shy away just because it is a Baptist University. The curriculum for the different departments is not all about religion. Aside from the religion department, the private school designation simply allows professors to share their faith in an applicable way in regards to your education and future career. People of all faiths or no faith are certainly welcome to come and enjoy everything there is to offer at ETBU.",
            "I didn't know where else to put this but it is unusual so I will share it here. No other university that I've heard of has a president that you can talk with and just hang out with during the day. I've had several meetings with him where I could just walk into his office without an appointment and get things done. He has also been in front of the U.S. Congress to fight for our rights as Christians.",
            "It is a little more expensive than many other places but I think students will find that it is well worth it in their lives.",
            "To be honest, Sodexo's food service is sub-par. Food is often over-cooked, under-cooked, or just plain repetitive. Luckily, there are many food option available just a short drive from campus.",
            "The university is in progress of building a new dorm that will be pretty awesome. A lot of rules have been changed since I've been here. There's no longer a freshman curfew and visitation hours have been prolonged and are available every day instead of just weekends.",
            "College is college. The type of work required varies from major to major but rest assured that you education will be given to you by experienced and dedicated educators.",
            "The great thing about ETBU is that the class sizes are small. Unlike a large university, the professors are very willing to meet with you to help you with your studies. Take advantage of this if you are struggling in a certain subject or simply want to know more about something.",
            "East Texas Baptist University is a great small university in Marshall, Texas. The slogan A world of opportunity in a community of faith exemplifies what ETBU tries to accomplish."

Even the old dorm we toured was nice. Definitely liked the layout with private bedrooms shared by four students with a common living area and a small kitchen. Seemed like the students enjoyed being there and lots of activities.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The campus always has something going on. Whether it be small group bible lessons, corporate worship, or guest musician performing/speaking, there are multiple things one can participate in. This allows for many opportunities to meet new people, and make life-long friends. The Campus itself is beautiful: perfect for walks outside or outdoor gatherings. Overflowing with the love of Christ, the students and faculty are genuine and friendly. All of these factors combined create an enjoyable environment. Am learning a lot Teachers show a love for the subject they teach, and are available for extra help if needed. They push you to learn and give your best effort, but are there for you when you struggle. The small class sizes allow for more engaging participation.
