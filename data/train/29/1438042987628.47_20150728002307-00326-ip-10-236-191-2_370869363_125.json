The highlighted line represents the updates to reflect RFC 2327., 65662=In RFC 2833, unused corresponds to the volume field, but is not used in NOTIFY-based out-of-band DTMF relay., 31357=The session information is optional, therefore internal structures are not built to expect this parameter. Specifically, internal memory is only allocated for this parameter when it is present in SDP, or when the application specifies that it be built into an outgoing message. In order to protect the internal operation of the Cisco IOS gateway, the maximum allowable length of a received session information line is 1000 characters. Session information lines over 1000 characters are truncated., 69102=The NOTIFY-based out-of-band DTMF relay mechanism is similar to the DTMF message format described in RFC 2833. NOTIFY-based out-of-band DTMF relay consists of 4 bytes in a binary encoded format. The message format is shown in the figure below; the table below describes the fields., 28183=The following example shows a configured list of hostnames. The highlighted lines represent the updates to reflect RFC 2327., 221768=ISDN messages follow the format specified in ISDN Primary Rate Interface Call Control Switching and Signalling Generic Requirements for Class II Equipment, TR-NWT-001268, Revisions 1-4, Telcordia Technologies Technical Reference, 2001 and ISDN Basic Rate Interface Call Control Switching and Signalling Generic Requirements, GR-268-CORE, July 1998, to signal call control. ISDN messages are composed of information elements (IEs). The Cisco IOS VoiceXML feature uses Calling Party Number and Display Text IEs to provide specified screening and presentation treatment. The Calling Party Number IE specifies the origin of the calling number and presentation status, and the Display Text IE supplies calling party name information that is formatted for display by a terminal for a human user. See the Setup message in \"ISDN Syntax\" for sample IE information., 62381=Every DTMF event corresponds to at least two NOTIFY message requests: an initial NOTIFY message and an end NOTIFY message. There might also be some update NOTIFY message requests involved, if the total duration of the event is greater than the negotiated max-duration interval. Because DTMF events generally last for less than 1000 ms, setting the duration using the notify telephone-event command to more than 1000 ms reduces the total number of NOTIFY messages sent. The default value of the notify telephone-event command is 2000 ms.}",
