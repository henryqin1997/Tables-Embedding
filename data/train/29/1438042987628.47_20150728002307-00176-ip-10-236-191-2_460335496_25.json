In making this evaluation, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u0093COSO\u0094) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

The decrease was primarily due to menu reengineering within our current menu categories. Our weighted average commodity costs remained flat in fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year. We implemented a cumulative total menu price increase of 5.3% during, 94658=Employees: \u00a0At December 17, 2012, we had approximately 400 employees of which 337 are part time hourly employees and 63 are salaried employees working full time. \u00a0We consider our employee relations to be good. \u00a0None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement., 416590=2012, 461974=Fiscal 2012, 445306=Balance at September 30, 2012, 630398=Restated Bylaws of Registrant dated November 7, 1997 (previously filed as Exhibit 3.6 to the registrant\u0092s Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1997 (File No. 000-18590) and incorporated herein by reference), 656049=*Certification of Chief Executive Officer and Controller pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, 635629=Cash Bonus Plan for Boyd Hoback (previously filed as Exhibit 10.20 to the registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 (File No. 000-18590) and incorporated herein by reference), 535118=2012, 404679=Note payable with Wells Fargo Bank, NA with scheduled payments of principal and interest (prime rate less .5%) due monthly, and the final payment due in January 2014. \u00a0The loan is collateralized by Security Agreements related to the furniture, fixtures and equipment of the eight corporate restaurants. This note was repaid in full on October 2, 2012., 422793=The Company is contingently liable on the sublease rentals disclosed above. The subleased and assigned leases expire between 2015 and 2024. In the past the Company has never been required to pay any significant amount in connection with its guarantees and currently we have not been notified nor are we aware of any leases in default by the franchisees, however there can be no assurance that there will not be such defaults in the future which could have a material effect on our future operating results., 36341=In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and after several months of development, we began the test of a new chicken platform centered on All Natural, Hand Breaded Chicken Tenders. \u00a0\u00a0We anticipate the system wide rollout in early fiscal 2013, which will make Good Times the only quick service restaurant chain in Colorado serving All Natural beef and chicken with no hormones, no steroids, no antibiotics and humanely raised animals with no animal byproducts in the feed. \u00a0We anticipate increasing our marketing messaging and expenditures around this strategic platform in fiscal 2013., 219436=Net interest expense for fiscal 2011 includes non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs of $48,000 related to: 1) warrants issued in conjunction with the extension of the PFGI II loan in January, 2010; and 2) beneficial conversion rights and warrants related to the loan agreement with W Capital and John T.

We expect to make modest price increases in fiscal 2013 but anticipate larger menu reengineering within our current menu categories and the addition of a new menu category that will reduce our overall cost of sales as a percentage of sales., 454407=Common Stock Transactions - In October 2010, the Company and SII entered into a purchase agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell 1,400,000 Shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $1.50 per share, or $2,100,000. \u00a0Subsequently the Company and SII also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Company granted SII certain registration rights with respect to resale of the Shares. \u00a0As a result of the completion of the SII Investment Transaction, SII became the beneficial owner of approximately 51.4 percent of the Company\u0092s outstanding Common Stock., 525450=September 1987, 41246=On November 30, 2012 we purchased the real estate underlying an existing restaurant from our landlord for $760,000. \u00a0In connection with the real estate purchase we have entered into an additional sale leaseback agreement that is expected to close in January 2013 and we expect to recognize net proceeds of $870,000. \u00a0We entered into an amendment to the PFGI II loan agreement whereby we will repay the remaining loan balance out of the sale leaseback proceeds from the closing on this sale leaseback transaction., 127642=Our NASDAQ Listing Is Important. Our Common Stock is currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market. \u00a0The NASDAQ maintenance rules require, among other things, that our common stock price remains above $1.00 per share and that we have minimum stockholders\u0092 equity of $2.5 million. \u00a0During fiscal 2012, we received notice of non-compliance with the minimum stockholders\u0092 equity requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. \u00a0The closing of our private placement transaction with SII on September 28, 2012 has allowed the Company to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders\u0092 equity requirement. \u00a0In addition, SII has agreed to purchase an additional 118,483 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, for an additional aggregate purchase price of $500,000 (or $4.22 per share), on or before March 31, 2013, at such time as the Company\u0092s Board of Directors reasonably determines, with 45 days\u0092 prior notice to SII, that the Company requires such funds to maintain the minimum stockholders\u0092 equity requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market., 574743=The following table sets forth compensation information for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 with respect to directors:, 148654=June 30, 2012, 455812=On December 13, 2010 the company received Board of Directors and Shareholder approval to effect a one-for-three reverse stock split of its Common Stock no later than December 31, 2010. Immediately prior to the reverse stock split the company had 8,177,989 of Common Stock outstanding and immediately following the reverse split the outstanding shares were approximately 2,725,996 (subsequently 218 shares have been issued for rounding of fractional shares resulting from the reverse split). All disclosures and amounts included herein have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse split., 418019=As of September 30, 2012, future minimum rental commitments required under the Company\u0092s operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows:, 606834=Includes 2,000 shares underlying presently exercisable stock options and 5,834 warrants to purchase stock. \u00a0Mr. Teran was elected as a director effective April 10, 2012 to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of John Morgan on August 10, 2011., 636972=2001 Stock Option Plan, as amended (previously filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the registrant\u0092s Registration Statement on Form S-8 filed on May 23, 2005 (Registration No. 333-125150) and incorporated herein by reference), 522333=In this context, the Audit Committee met with management and the independent accountants to review and discuss the Company\u0092s financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. \u00a0Management represented to the Audit Committee that the financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the financial statements with management and the independent accountants., 460366=During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, the Company granted 4,000 non-statutory stock options and 53,233 incentive stock options with exercise prices of $1.56. \u00a0The per-share weighted average fair value was $1.26 for both the non-statutory stock option grants and incentive stock option grants., 205313=Restaurant-level costs for the period ended September 30, 2011, 593459=Ownership of common stock by principal stockholders and management: The following table shows the beneficial ownership of shares of the Company\u0092s Common Stock as of December 17, 2012 by each person known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the shares of the Company\u0092s Common Stock, each director and each executive officer named in the Summary Compensation Table, and all directors and executive officers as a group. \u00a0The address for the principal stockholders and the directors and officers is 601 Corporate Circle, Golden, CO 80401., 380773=During the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 the Company incurred expenses of $15,000 and income of $22,000, respectively, and has a remaining lease liability of $82,000 as of September 30, 2012, related to a restaurant that was closed prior to 2011 and was previously classified as discontinued operations. Due to the insignificance of the amounts, the Company has reclassified such amounts as other expense in operations and as other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet., 639856=Expansion of Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (previously filed as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2 to the registrant's Form 8-K Report dated March 15, 2007 (File No. 000-18590) and incorporated herein by reference), 651299=Consent and Waiver dated as of December 13, 2010 (previously filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the registrant\u0092s Form 8-K Report dated December 17, 2010 (File No. 000-18590) and incorporated herein by reference), 503210=As set forth above, prior to March 2012, Messrs. Dobbin and Heller each served as a director and executive officer of Elephant & Castle Group Inc. \u00a0On June 28, 2011, Elephant & Castle Group, Inc. and related subsidiaries (collectively, the \u0093Elephant & Castle Group\u0094) filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. \u00a0The Elephant & Castle Group subsequently sold all of its assets in a sale under the bankruptcy proceedings., 519937=The Compensation Committee has the authority to directly engage, at the Company\u0092s expense, any compensation consultants or other advisers as it deems necessary to carry out its responsibilities in determining the amount and form of executive and director compensation. \u00a0For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, the Compensation Committee did not use the services of a compensation consultant or other adviser. \u00a0However, the Compensation Committee has reviewed surveys, reports, and other market data against which it has measured the competitiveness of the Company\u0092s compensation programs. \u00a0In determining the amount and form of executive and director compensation, the Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed historical salary information as well as salaries for similar positions at comparable companies., 412174=Other accrued liabilities consist of the following at September 30, 2012:, 232870=Sales projections are as follows: Fiscal 2013 sales are projected to increase 6% with respect to fiscal 2012 and for fiscal years 2014 to 2027 we have used annual increases of 2% to 3%. The 6% increase in fiscal 2013 is due to the addition of breakfast sales. We believe the 2% to 3% increase in the fiscal years beyond 2013 is a reasonable expectation of growth and that it would be unreasonable to expect no growth in our sales. These increases include menu price increases in addition to any real growth. Historically our weighted menu prices have increased 1.5% to 6%., 229744=Discontinued Operations: The Company analyzes its operations on a regional basis, when evaluating closed restaurant operations for consideration as to the classification between continuing operations and discontinued operations. \u00a0Prior to 2010 the Company evaluated operations at the restaurant level. In its reevaluation the Company determined that as most of the Company\u0092s restaurants are within the Denver metropolitan region and share common advertising, distribution, supervision, and to a certain extent even customers, the Company believes it appropriate to perform its analysis on a regional basis. During fiscal 2011 the Company closed two restaurants, and in fiscal 2012, the Company closed an additional two restaurants. \u00a0The operations related to these restaurants are reflected as part of continuing operations as they were within one continuing operating region., 513276=Audit Committee: The Audit Committee currently consists of Messrs. Calvert (Chairman), Reinhard, and Teran. \u00a0The Board has determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee are \u0093independent,\u0094 as defined by the NASDAQ listing standards and by applicable SEC rules. \u00a0In addition, the Board has determined that Mr. Calvert is an audit committee financial expert, as that term is defined by the SEC rules, by virtue of having the following attributes through relevant experience: (i) an understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements; (ii) the ability to assess the general application of such principles in connection with the accounting for estimates, accruals, and reserves; (iii) experience preparing, auditing, analyzing, or evaluating financial statements that present a breadth and level of complexity of accounting issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can reasonably be expected to be raised by the Company\u0092s financial statements, or experience actively supervising one or more persons engaged in such activities; (iv) \u00a0an understanding of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting; and (v) an understanding of audit committee functions. \u00a0Prior to his resignation from the Board effective June 30, 2012, Keith Radford served as our audit committee financial expert., 163663=2012, 246756=through September 30, 2012, 391245=The Company is subject to taxation in various jurisdictions. The Company continues to remain subject to examination by U.S. federal authorities for the years 2009 through 2012. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded. The Company's practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. No accrual for interest and penalties was considered necessary as of September 30, 2012., 634233=Wells Fargo Credit Agreement (previously filed as Exhibit 10.17 to the registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 (File No. 000-18590) and incorporated herein by reference), 386954=Deferred Liabilities \u0096 Rent expense is reflected on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all leases containing step-ups in base rent. \u00a0An obligation representing future payments (which totaled $283,000 as of September 30, 2012) is reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a deferred liability. \u00a0Also included in the $652,000 deferred and other liabilities balance is a $282,000 deferred gain on the sale of the building and improvements of one Company-owned restaurant in a sale leaseback transaction. The building and improvements were subsequently leased back from the third party purchaser.

We continue to evaluate the near term realizable asset value of each restaurant compared to its longer term cash flow value and we may choose to sell, sublease or close a limited number of additional lower performing restaurants in fiscal 2013 as we position the company for growth in new store development and reposition our stores away from trade areas that may have shifted demographically or from our current concept direction. \u00a0We will require additional capital sources to develop additional company-owned restaurants.

The decrease in loss from operations for the fiscal year is due primarily to matters discussed in the \"Restaurant Operating Costs\", \"General and Administrative Costs\", \u0093Franchise Costs\u0094 and \u0093Loss (Gain) on Restaurant Assets\u0094 sections above., 214960=Advertising Costs: For fiscal 2012, advertising costs increased $39,000 from $757,000 (3.8% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2011 to $796,000 (4.1% of restaurant sales)., 443057=In April 2012 the Company entered into a financial advisory services agreement with Heathcote Capital LLC pursuant to which they will provide the Company with exclusive financial advisory services in connection with a possible strategic transaction.

Morgan on August 10, 2011. \u00a0On the same date, Mr. Teran was appointed as a member of the Audit Committee and as the chairman of the Compensation Committee, to succeed Mr. Heller in both capacities. \u00a0Mr. Teran also served on our Board from 1994 to 2010., 207697=Food and Packaging Costs: Food and packaging costs for fiscal 2012 decreased $649,000 from $7,241,000 (35.9% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2011 to $6,592,000 (34.2% of restaurant sales)., 222019=PFGI II LLC Promissory Note: In July 2008, we borrowed $2,500,000 from PFGI II, LLC (\u0093PFGI II\u0094), an unrelated third party, and issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $2,500,000 to PFGI II (the \u0093PFGI II Note\u0094). \u00a0The PFGI II Note has subsequently been amended on several occasions. During 2011 and 2012, the interest rate on the note was 8.65%. \u00a0In April 2012 PFGI II agreed to extend the loan to December 31, 2013 on the existing note terms if a sale leaseback has not been completed on the Firestone property. The note balance at September 30, 2012 was $1,318,000. On November 30, 2012 we entered into a sale lease-back transaction on the Firestone property with net proceeds of $1,380,000 and we used $765,000 to pay down the PFGI II Note. The remaining balance of $545,000 is due on or before January 31, 2013 which we anticipate repaying from the proceeds of a sale leaseback transaction., 202484=Average restaurant sales for company-owned and co-developed restaurants (including double drive thru restaurants and restaurants with dining rooms but excluding dual brand restaurants and out of market restaurants) for fiscal 2011 and 2012 were as follows:, 30973=Certification of Controller pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

In its reevaluation the Company determined that as most of the Company\u0092s restaurants are within the Denver metropolitan region and share common advertising, distribution, supervision, and to a certain extent even customers, the Company believes it appropriate to perform its analysis on a regional basis. During 2011 the Company closed two restaurants and in 2012 the Company closed an additional two restaurants.\u00a0 The operations related to these restaurants are reflected as part of continuing operations as they were within one continuing operating region., 642117=Letter Agreement between Good Times Drive Thru Inc. and CEDA Enterprises, Inc.

As of September 30, 2012, 324,711 shares were available for future grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and stock-based awards., 505325=Messrs. Calvert, Dobbin, Heller, and Teran were originally elected to the Board pursuant to the director designation rights granted to SII under the Securities Purchase Agreement dated October 29, 2010 between the Company and SII (the \u0093Prior Purchase Agreement\u0094). \u00a0The Prior Purchase Agreement provides that, for so long as SII continues to own at least 50% of our outstanding capital stock, (i) our Board shall not consist of more than seven directors, and (ii) SII shall have the right to designate four individuals for election to our Board. \u00a0The Purchase Agreement between the Company and SII dated June 13, 2012 reconfirms and continues SII\u0092s director designation rights as provided by the Prior Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to both the Prior Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, SII has also agreed to vote its shares in any election of directors for one individual designated by The Bailey Group and one individual designated by Mr. Reinhard and his affiliates, in addition to the Investor\u0092s four director designees. \u00a0Mr. Hoback is the seventh member of our Board., 76628=Menu: \u00a0The menu of a Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard restaurant is limited to hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches, french fries, onion rings, fresh squeezed and frozen lemonades, soft drinks and frozen custard products. \u00a0In November 2012 we introduced Hatch Valley Green Chile Breakfast Burritos, orange juice and coffee. \u00a0Each menu item is made to order at the time the customer places the order and is not pre-prepared., 495140=Mr. Hoback has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer since December 1992 and has been in the restaurant business since the age of 16. \u00a0Mr. Hoback has been a vital part of the development of the Company to a 46-restaurant chain and has been involved in developing and managing all areas of the Company. \u00a0Mr. Hoback is an honors graduate of the University of Colorado in Finance., 459755=Net loss for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 includes $69,000 and $61,000, respectively, of compensation costs related to our stock-based compensation arrangements., 75172=In December 2011 a franchisee\u0092s franchise agreement expired for a restaurant operating in Boise, Idaho and the franchisee closed the restaurant. Also in December 2011 we sold one company-owned restaurant in Littleton, Colorado for cash. In April 2012 a franchisee closed a restaurant in Colorado Springs, Colorado as part of our exit from that market. In July 2012 we sold one company-owned restaurant in Loveland, Colorado. In August we purchased a restaurant in Loveland, Colorado from the franchisee. In December 2012 a franchisee terminated its Good Times franchise agreement in the dual brand concept and has stopped selling Good Times products at two Colorado locations. \u00a0We anticipate that franchisees may close one low volume franchised restaurants in fiscal 2013 and we may close one lower volume company operated restaurants, which would result in improved overall operating margins and more efficient allocation of overhead resources., 472309=There was no intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 as no options were exercised., 220393=Cash and Working Capital: As of September 30, 2012, we had a working capital excess of $848,000. Because restaurant sales are collected in cash and accounts payable for food and paper products are paid two to four weeks later, restaurant companies often operate with working capital deficits. We anticipate that working capital deficits may be incurred in the future and possibly increase if and when new Good Times restaurants are opened. \u00a0We believe that we will have sufficient capital to meet our working capital, long term debt obligations and recurring capital expenditure needs in fiscal 2013 and beyond. We will require additional capital sources for the development of new restaurants. Additionally, we may sell or sublease select underperforming company operated restaurants if we believe the realizable asset value is greater than the long term cash flow value or if the asset does not fit our longer term distribution and location of restaurants., 163978=2010, 647409=Loan Agreement, Convertible Secured Promissory Note and Warrants (previously filed as Exhibits 4.1, 10.1 and 10.2 to the registrant\u0092s Form 8-K Report dated February 3, 2010 (File No. 000-18590) and incorporated herein by reference), 645404=Loan Agreement, Promissory Note, Warrant, Intercreditor Agreement and First Amendment to Amended and Restated Promissory Note (previously filed as Exhibits 4.1, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 to the registrant's Form 8-K Report dated April 20, 2009 (File No. 000-18590) and incorporated herein by reference), 393685=Financial instruments potentially subjecting the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of receivables. \u00a0At September 30, 2012 notes receivable totaled $20,000 and are due from two entities. \u00a0The Company has a $1,500,000 current receivable related to the preferred stock sale that occurred on September 28, 2012.

Because payroll costs are semi-variable in nature they decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales when there is an increase in restaurant sales. Additionally payroll and other employee benefits decreased approximately $519,000 in fiscal 2012 due to two company-owned restaurants sold in February and May 2011, one company-owned restaurant sold in December 2011 and one company owned restaurant sold in July 2012. \u00a0We anticipate payroll and other employee benefit costs will decrease as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2013 due to the operating leverage on increasing sales., 223029=SII Investment Transactions: \u00a0On December 13, 2010, we closed on a private placement of 1,400,000 shares of our Common Stock to SII for an aggregate purchase price of $2,100,000 (or $1.50 per share), pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement between the Company and SII dated October 29, 2010, as amended December 13, 2010. \u00a0As a result of the completion of the investment transaction with SII, SII became the beneficial owner of approximately 51.4, 644516=Suspension of Development Agreement previously filed as Exhibit 10.41 to the registrant\u0092s Form 10-KSB Report dated December 26, 2008 (File No. 000-18590) and incorporated herein by reference), 136868=We currently lease approximately 3,700 square feet of space for our executive offices in Golden, Colorado for approximately $58,000 per year under a lease agreement which expires in December 2012 and we anticipate extending the lease beyond 2012.

Section 1350, 225307=Cash Flows: Net cash used in operating activities was $22,000 for fiscal 2012 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $539,000 in fiscal 2011. \u00a0The increase in net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for fiscal 2012 was the result of a net loss of $668,000 and non-cash reconciling items totaling $846,000 (comprised principally of 1) \u00a0depreciation and amortization of $795,000; 2) amortization of debt issuance costs of $26,000; 3) $69,000 of stock option compensation expense; 4) a $51,000 gain on asset sales; 5) a $116,000 increase in other receivables and other assets: and 7) net increases in operating assets and liabilities totaling $77,000)., 379022=Basis of Presentation\u0096 The Company analyzes its operations on a regional basis, when evaluating closed restaurant operations for consideration as to the classification between continuing operations and discontinued operations. \u00a0As most of the Company\u0092s restaurants are within the Denver metropolitan region and share common advertising, distribution, supervision, and to a certain extent even customers, the Company believes it appropriate to perform its analysis on a regional basis. During 2011 the Company closed two restaurants and in 2012, the Company has closed an additional two restaurants.\u00a0 The operations related to these restaurants are reflected as part of continuing operations as they were within one continuing operating region. The Company had minimal gains in connection with the sales of each of these restaurants and their combined operating losses were approximately $275,000 in 2011 and $158,000 in 2012., 462197=Fiscal 2011, 642597=Letter Agreement between Good Times Drive Thru Inc. and CEDA Enterprises, Inc. and CEJ Investments, LLC (previously filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the registrant\u0092s Form 8-K Report dated March 12, 2008 (File No. 000-18590) and incorporated herein by reference), 80393=Media is an important component of building Good Times\u0092 brand awareness and distinctiveness. \u00a0We spent most of our broadcast advertising dollars on radio media during fiscal 2012. \u00a0The Colorado market is an expensive media market, so most of our advertising placement is not in prime time but in early and late fringe, prime access and late news time slots. \u00a0As we continue to develop more and more distinctiveness to Good Times\u0092 brand and increase penetration of the Colorado market, we anticipate we will continue to use media advertising to increase overall awareness. \u00a0However, during fiscal 2012, we reduced our overall advertising expenditures and focused more of our marketing funds on store level and trade area level communication and activities, supplemented by social media. During fiscal 2013 we will continue with limited broadcast media, a social media presence that affords us a higher level of engagement with current customers and an increased level of product giveaways to support high sales opportunity products., 645958=Agreement between Good Times Restaurants Inc. and Mastodon Ventures Inc.

A charge of $61,000 is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations to adjust the assets to their fair market value.

We hope to increase guest counts throughout fiscal 2013 through a multi-faceted approach to continually improve the Good Times brand experience for our customers by:, 504776=Eric W.
