            "Pre-Health, Pre-Law, and Engineering. There are a lot of different programs, but these programs are some of the best. But this school is geared for everyone and it has clubs, groups, and classes for everyone.",
            "Start early on the application because you want to make sure you get first pick on housing. Also go to the Orientation early to ensure your place in the classes you need. Also try to get Dual Enrollment, IB and AP credit because it will take care of a lot of your General Education credits. You will be able to jump right into your major.",
            "The tuition cost isn't bad for all that you get. You get a lot of credits worth your time and the amount you spend on food and housing is a lot less than many people think. The dorms are a great price and the food is really good for the amount you pay for a meal plan.",
            "There are plenty of clubs and groups to join as long with a lot of things to down in downtown and midtown. There are a lot of places to eat and hangout. The classes may be a little difficult but many of the professors are sarcastic and funny, along with extrememly understanding about personal issues.",
            "UF is a great university and is definitely the top university in the state of Florida. There are many different classes for a lot of different interests and the classes challenge you to do your best. Even when you take classes you aren't particularly interested in, you will pick up a lot of information in a little amount of time."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34809=Get everything together early and be as prepared as possible to apply by that November 1 deadline - UF has scrapped Early Decision along with a few ivies in the country., 1094294=Make sure to really work on your application to UF to make sure there are no errors. Aim for an SAT and ACT score within their middle 50% (somewhere between a 1900 and 2100 for the SAT and 27-31 for the ACT) or better, and make sure to take many rigorous classes in high school. Also, show a passion for attending UF in your essays or elsewhere on your application., 582346=i guess we're safe... there's blue emergency lights scattered around the campus, a separate police dept for uf, and scan-card dorms, but rapings and suspects with guns have been reported to the students via email and text just in fall 2011. oh and some shots fired... but i haven't seen anything, which is good. just make smart choices. the person who got raped, got in the car for a ride to campus with an elderly male she didn't know., 613241=there is so much to do at the university of florida! in the reitz union there is a game room with a bowling alley which is always a lot of fun. uf also has gator nights every friday night, where students can go to the reitz union for free and partake in a bunch of activities including midnight breakfast. they also show movies in the reitz union on fridays. there are also about 1000 clubs at uf as well as multiple sororities and fraternities. lastly the gator nation is very big on football. there's nothing like being in the swamp cheering on the gators with your gator family., 911913=There are numerous blue light emergency posts everywhere on campus, and guarantee police assistance within 60 seconds of when the button was pushed. A free snap transportation service is provided, which gives students a ride anywhere on campus after 3:00 AM., 49808=UF is one of the top 50 universities in the US and a great education for a tuition of about $4000 a year and housing is about $2000 for each semester is an amazing deal. If you received Bright Futures you really only have to pay for housing (and of course books and food.) UF also has many research opportunities with top-rated professors available for undergraduates., 48916=Apply as early as possible, way before the November 1st deadline. The earlier you apply, the earlier you can apply for housing (if you are planning on living on campus.) I find that living on campus is really convenient, where you can literally wake up ten minutes before your class and still make it. Off campus has it's perks but it costs about the same as on campus housing and you have to take the bus (which are often times always late.) I suggest living on campus for at least your first year. Also, UF seems to emphasize this quite a lot but GET INVOLVED! Try something new! Get new experiences!, 820345=There are over 1000 student organizations, if we don't have the one you are looking for it is extremely easy to create one yourself., 611633=the university of florida has about 1000 clubs with everything from a quidditch team to clubs for intramural sports., 939581=Dorms are not my thing. I stayed in them and sharing a bathroom with many girls is not what I enjoy. A plus for dorms is that you can meet a lot of people and you are right on campus so classes will be closer, as long as your 7:30 class isn't on the opposite side of campus, you will be able to enjoy every second of sleep., 502966=The campus is gorgeous (besides the weather in August and September, but that's horrible everywhere in Florida)! For being such a large university, it's really easy to get involved in organizations., 322695=The French Fries is a favorite sculpture near the Marston Science Library done by artist John Henry that was placed on campus in February 1989. Though the actual name of the piece is Alachua, named for the county which the city of Gainesville calls home, it still remains a notorious landmark often referred to when giving directions to campus visitors and Freshman. Another popular sculpture around campus, The Potato, is located near Turlington Hall and serves as a popular meeting point. Krishna Lunch, a full vegetarian meal, is served daily in the Plaza of the Americas for dirt cheap, and it is delicious!, 246201=Home to almost 1000 campus organizations, UF offers something for every student that attends. From greek life to skydiving to intramurals, almost anything you can think of will probably exist at the University., 172699=Like I previously mentioned, there are almost 1000 clubs and just about anything you can think of. There are tons of intramural sports and workout facilities all over campus!}",

Also great for those who like getting involved and are very school spirited. Tips for prospective students Definitely get involved with whatever organization/group you can. It will help you get over the whole idea of being away from home. Make sure you study for classes and don't wait until the last minute cause you will regret it. I would recommend living on campus for the first year but not wasting your money on the meal plan. Bang for the buck One of the least expensive state schools in Florida and also one of the cheapest housing areas in",
