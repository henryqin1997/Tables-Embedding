            "Make sure that you are always aware of your surroundings. It is also important to not give someone opportunity, meaning that don't leave your bag unattended while you are across the hall talking to someone or leave unnecessary things in your vehicle.",
            "I really don't know what to say about this...just always try hard.",
            "The best advice for a student is to get involved and stay involved as this will help you build relationships and friendships that some day may help you in the long run.",
            "Think that every student should have a study partner, as you are able to ask questions back and forth and quiz each other. This would allow you to evaluate what you truly know.",
            "The only tradition that I can think of is that Christmas morning we all wait to open presents until the entire family is there, after that we used to go to my grandparents and have breakfast and open presents there.",
            "Feel that if you are able to get scholarships for school that you may feel less stress in the long run. I can honestly say this is my first time in applying for scholarships and wish that had done this a very long time ago.",
            "It is important to maintain a balance of life in all aspects. If you are unable to unwind from everything it can take a toll on you. I believe that healthy activities such as exercise, playing sports and being with friends and family is important.",
            "It is important to make sure that you make yourself eat healthy as the extra energy that comes from eating properly is well needed. Also if you don't take care of yourself with stress of school your immune system can decline and you become more susceptible to illness.",
            "I actually have never been a student that has stayed on campus. But I could imagine the stress that would put on a student, so make sure that you don't get yourself wrapped up in the partying aspect of being a student that stays on campus.",
            "Make sure you are surrounded with a support system. Choose your study peers wisely. Also be sure to utilize the tools that are offered by the school such as tutoring and study aids.",
            "When selecting a school to attend make sure it is truly what you are looking for. Research the school before you go and then have a base to go off of and visit the campus and based on the two make a decision. Think long term what is going to benefit you the most so that you are able to feel good about what you are doing. Always apply for scholarships and money that you won't have to pay back it could make a difference.",
            "A school with outstanding opportunity that provides small classes and offers great benefits to their students. Also the technology provided for the student to work with is cutting edge and will allow a smooth transition into the field once completed. Basically an all in one institute that has top notch programs."
