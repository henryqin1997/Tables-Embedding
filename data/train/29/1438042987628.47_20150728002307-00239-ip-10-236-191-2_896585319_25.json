            "The security holds a tight lid. Students often jog at night. I, honestly, felt very safe in that school. This is a very positive environment.",
            "None. However, each dorm floor has its own name, with a joint sister or brother wing. So, in a way, it is like a Greek life...minus excessive parties. The student body overall cares about their academics.",
            "They are a lot of clubs and different ways to get involved.",
            "Students who value a faith-based environment, but not limited to Christians. There were a lot of non-Christians who attended.",
            "The 1 A.M. curfew feels unusual, because it feels like restraint. However, it is actually good. I discovered the better use of the night, which is sleep or academics. This is coming from someone who is a night-owl and will stay up until 4 A.M. to edit a video or memorize lines.",
            "I love this school! This senrich really taught me how to stand on my two-feet. In essence, it helped prepare me toward a better future through the discovery of aiming for greater heights.",
            "Sports intramurals; Showcase each semester for all students who want to act in the school plays; Student Association; foreign languages' clubs; big on dorm floor events (sisterhood; brotherhood); and more.",
            "The cafateria, Saga, is okay, but that's to be expected with cafeteria food. However, I'm a picky eater when it comes to food; do consider that. Upgrade: they just got a salad bar!",
            "Still some 70s flare in design and architecture. But tons of recent renovations have been done within the past year (the most I have seen in all 3 years I was there). Fun fact: Oral Roberts, the founder, was colored blind and the only color that he could see in it's full hue was gold. This made me start to like all the random gold 70s design.",
            "Prepare to work hard by studying hard. This is a private school. They will make sure you get your money's worth.",
            "Visit the campus beforehand, with the College Weekend events, to check out the university and sit-in on classes.",
            "Oral Roberts University has pretegious standards given its location and comparisons to surrounding schools. I've grown up in different neighboring cities. The institution strives in educating the whole person: mind (with academics), body (with required health/athletic classes every semester), and soul (with twice a week chapel services, which are actually fun and relaxing)."

Oral Roberts University is also currently in the best position it has ever been since around when it opened in 1963. The newest incoming president, Mark Rutland is a phenomenal president, with the student's best interest at heart. I am thrilled to be here., 294724=ORU is very safe. To get into each of the dorms, you must swipe your eagle card. In Gabby, a swipe of your eagle card as well as a pin number is required to get into your room. In Claudius, EMR, and towers, you have a key for your room. At night, when many of the buildings are closed, they require an eagle card swipe to get the doors to unlock. There is also a curfew at 1:30 and last until 5:30 until you can get back onto campus.}",
