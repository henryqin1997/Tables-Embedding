            "SECURITY PAPER, MANUFACTURING METHOD AND SECURITY DOCUMENT OBTAINED WITH SAID PAPER - The invention consists in a security paper, as well as the security document obtained with it and the manufacturing process thereof, that combines the security elements called windowed thread with the high contrast single-tone watermark technique. In order to carry out this invention, we make use of the recesses created to cover the thread in the areas where it is visible, which exhibit a greater accumulation of fibres and are therefore opaque areas in the final paper, to insert therein the electrotype or high contrast single-tone watermarks.",
            "USE OF LUMINESCENT NANOSYSTEMS FOR AUTHENTICATING SECURITY DOCUMENTS - The present invention relates to the use of nanosystems as non deactivable security markers comprising metal atomic quantum clusters (AQCs) of at least two different size distributions encapsulated in a cavity with an inner diameter less than or equal to approximately 10 nm. These nanosystems are luminescence, particularly fluorescence after external excitation. The invention also relates to security documents, articles or elements incorporating these markers as well as to a method and a system for detecting the same.",
            "USE OF RAMAN MARKERS FOR AUTHENTICATING SECURITY DOCUMENTS - The present invention relates to the use of non deactivable security markers comprising the combination of at least two types of nanoparticles of materials presenting Raman effect, wherein said nanoparticles are in a dispersed state or is forming ag glomerates of between 2 and 500 nanoparticles. The invention also relates to security documents, articles or elements incorporating these markers, as well as to a method and system for the detection thereof.",
            "USE OF RADIOFREQUENCY WAVE ABSORBING MARKETS FOR THE AUTHENTICATION OF SECURITY DOCUMENTS - The present invention relates to the use of non-deactivatable security compositions comprising the combination of at least two types of particles of oxide materials, where said particles have a different size and/or morphology, and where the inorganic oxide materials have at least one transition metal or one lanthanide element, and radiofrequency wave absorption properties. The invention also relates to security articles, documents or elements incorporating these compositions, as well as to a method and to a system for detection thereof."

A voltage to be monitored, is determined during operation of the consumer, which represents a voltage fluctuation of supply voltage potentials of the constant-voltage d.c. link with respect to a reference potential. In addition, a variable characterizing an electrical frequency of the electrical consumer is determined, particularly an electrical angular speed of the electrical consumer. A first spectral amplitude of the voltage to be monitored at the n-fold electrical frequency of the electrical consumer, is compared to a first reference value, and detects a symmetrical insulation error in the constant-voltage d.c. link or the n-phased network, if the comparison yields",
