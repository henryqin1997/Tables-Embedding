    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The school is full of cliques and most of the students hardly have time for friends outside of academics and clubs so it is definitely hard to make friends after freshman year. In addition, there is not much of a party scene. However, the small campus is nice because it never takes more than 10 minutes to walk to class and the small class sizes are nice. Am learning a lot I am a sophomore and have learned a lot and enjoyed all my courses at Albright. However, the upper level courses are very difficult and demanding. I got 3 As and 1 B this semester, but I worked harder than I ever have for a grade in my life.
