    "textBeforeTable": "Table 3-2 Data Guard Protection Modes and Requirements The Data Guard GUI automatically specifies the correct log transport mode on the primary database in preparation for a future switchover. See Section 5.4.3 for additional information about changing the database protection mode. If the data protection mode requires that you change the log transport mode used by any of the standby databases, change the setting of the LogXptMode database property appropriately on each standby database. See Section 3.4 for more information about setting the log transport mode. Table 3-2 shows the protection modes, the corresponding log transport mode, and indicates whether or not SRLs are needed. Step 3 Set the LogXptMode property, if necessary. The Data Guard GUI automatically prompts you to select one or more standby databases in the configuration and sets up standby redo log (SRL) files on them and on the primary database in preparation for a future switchover. See Section 5.4.3 for additional information about changing the database protection mode. If the data protection mode that you need requires a standby database to use the SYNC or ASYNC log transport mode, you need to add standby redo log files to at least one standby database. (Note that the maximum performance mode does not require standby redo log files.) Step 2 Set up standby redo log (SRL) files, if needed. The maximum protection and maximum",
    "textAfterTable": "Step 4 Set the protection mode. Select the protection mode using the CLI or the Data Guard GUI. See Section 6.5 for additional information about setting the configuration protection mode. With the CLI: If you plan to set the protection mode to either the MAXPROTECTION or MAXAVAILABILITY, ensure that standby redo log files are configured on the standby database. Do this also for the primary database or another standby database in the configuration to ensure that it can support the chosen protection mode after a switchover. Use the EDIT DATABASE (property) command and specify the standby database whose log transport mode should be changed to correspond to the protection mode you plan to set. For example, if you plan to set the overall Data Guard configuration to the MAXAVAILABILITY mode, you must use the EDIT DATABASE command to set the SYNC mode for log transport services. For example: DGMGRL> EDIT DATABASE 'DR_Sales' SET PROPERTY 'LogXptMode'='SYNC'; Do this also for the primary database or another standby database in the configuration to ensure that it can support the chosen protection mode after a switchover. Use the EDIT CONFIGURATION SET PROTECTION MODE AS protection-mode command to set the overall configuration protection mode. For example: DGMGRL> EDIT CONFIGURATION SET PROTECTION MODE AS MAXAVAILABILITY; With the Data Guard GUI: From the Data Guard GUI overview page, click the link to the",
