            "Go to the bowling alley is pretty much the only thing to do. The bowling alley doesn't always open when it supposed to, but when it does open it is pretty much the only thing to do on campus. There are parties to go to sometimes, but most of the time they get shut down.",
            "The food is sub par at best. It seems as if most days the use the same food, they use it in a different way.",
            "Wamack Hall seems to be the absolute worse dorm to live in. Also, freshman can't move out of the dorms they are assigned to, so if someone is unhappy about where they are living they can't move somewhere else.",
            "Most of the teachers will try to get you to the academic level you need to be at to succeed in college.",
            "The big events are great experiences for the students of this campus, but other than that this school has to get better.",
            "Elizabeth City State University is is not as good as I thought it was going to be, though I did not expect it to be a anything close to a North Carolina A&T. It shouldn't have been this bad of an experience."
