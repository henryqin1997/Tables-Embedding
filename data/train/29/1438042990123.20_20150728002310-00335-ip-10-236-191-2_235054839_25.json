All teams will be required to submit their proposed 16-man roster in their \"priority order\" in which they evaluate talent based on the draft's market, knowing all other teams will be doing the same. These original submissions are due by Friday, August 14 at 6p. All teams are guaranteed to get their 2015 Pony Draft pick selected in May and any player they value more than any other team in this process.}",
