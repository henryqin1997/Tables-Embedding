    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students 2 years looking to go to a university Tips for prospective students The tip I could give a student wishing to attend FTCC is to check your deadlines! Talk to your advisor quickly if you don't think your teacher is right for you. Talk to people about scholarship and financial aid as early as possible. Also! careful because some classes are non transferable!! Bang for the buck For a community college it is still somewhat pricey. For taking 4 classes along with all the necessary books the payment can be around 2,000 dollars. Seek financial aid early on!
