    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{62300=The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is announcing that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the revised information collection requirements contained in the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) (29 CFR parts 1910, 1915, and 1926) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA-95). The OMB control number is 1218-0072., 92634=\u00a7 1911, 6844=On April 11, 2014 (79 FR 20316), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration published a final rule: Revising the general industry standards for electric power generation, transmission, and distribution work and for electrical protective equipment; revising the construction standard for electric power transmission and distribution work; and adopting a new construction standard for electrical protective equipment. The final rule updated those standards and made the general industry and construction standards consistent. This document corrects errors in the preamble and regulatory text of the final rule., 72185=OSHA is issuing this direct final rule to revise the personal protective equipment (PPE) sections of its general industry, shipyard employment, longshoring, and marine terminals standards regarding requirements for head protection. OSHA is updating the references in its standards to recognize the 2009 edition of the American National Standard for Industrial Head Protection, and is deleting the 1986 edition of that national consensus standard because it is out of date. OSHA also is including the construction industry in this rulemaking to ensure consistency among the Agency's standards. OSHA is publishing a proposed rule in today's Federal Register taking this same action., 94225=\u00a7 1801, 92532=\u00a7 1904 - Authorization of appropriations, 33208=This document contains corrections to the final regulations, which were published in the Federal Register of Thursday, June 13, 2013 (78 FR 35559). The regulations update OSHA's general industry and construction signage standards by adding references to the latest American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards on specifications for accident prevention signs and tags., 94866=114 Stat. 1901, 48431=OSHA is correcting its regulations that were amended by the Hazard Communication Standard final rule, published in the Federal Register on March 26, 2012. The majority of the corrections are to references inadvertently missed in the original publication of the final rule. Other corrections include correcting values or notations in tables, and updating references to terms., 20948=OSHA last issued rules for the construction of transmission and distribution installations in 1972. Those provisions are now out of date and inconsistent with the more recently promulgated general industry standard covering the operation and maintenance of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution lines and equipment. OSHA is revising the construction standard to make it more consistent with the general industry standard and is making some revisions to both the construction and general industry requirements. The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults. The revised standards will ensure that employers, when appropriate, must meet consistent requirements for work performed under the construction and general industry standards. The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber. OSHA is also revising the general industry standard for foot protection. This standard applies to employers performing work on electric power generation, transmission, and distribution installations, as well as employers in other industries. The final rule removes the requirement for employees to wear protective footwear as protection against electric shock., 87417=OSHA is confirming the effective date of its direct final rule that revises the Acetylene Standard for general industry by updating the reference to a standard published by a standards-developing organization, the Compressed Gas Association. In the December 5, 2011, direct final rule, OSHA stated that it would withdraw the companion proposed rule and confirm the effective date of the direct final rule if the Agency received no significant adverse comments. OSHA did not receive significant adverse comments on the direct final rule. Therefore, OSHA is confirming that the direct final rule will become effective on March 5, 2012., 57310=OSHA is confirming the effective date of its direct final rule that revises the Head Protection standards for general industry, shipyard employment, marine terminals, longshoring, and construction by updating the reference to a standard published by a standards-developing organization, the American National Standards Institute. In the June 22, 2012, direct final rule, OSHA stated that it would withdraw the companion proposed rule and confirm the effective date of the direct final rule if the Agency received no significant adverse comments. OSHA did not receive significant adverse comments on the direct final rule. Therefore, OSHA is confirming that the direct final rule became effective on September 20, 2012., 95823=Title 29 published on 2013-07-01, 95913=The following are ALL rules, proposed rules, and notices (chronologically) published in the Federal Register relating to 29 CFR Part 1910 after this date., 37456=On June 13, 2013, OSHA published in the Federal Register (78 FR 35559) a direct final rule that revised its signage standards for general industry and construction by updating the references to national consensus standards approved by the American National Standards Institute, a clearinghouse that verifies that the criteria for approval of consensus standards have been met. OSHA stated in that Federal Register notice that it would withdraw the companion proposed rule and confirm the effective date of the direct final rule if the Agency received no significant adverse comments on the direct final rule. Since OSHA received no such significant adverse comments, the Agency now confirms that the direct final rule became effective as a final rule on September 11, 2013., 43181=The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d or \u201cthe Agency\u201d) is issuing this direct final rule to update its general industry and construction signage standards by adding references to the latest versions of the American National Standards Institute (\u201cANSI\u201d) standards on specifications for accident prevention signs and tags, ANSI Z535.1-2006(R2011), Z535.2-2011 and Z535.5-2011. In this rulemaking, OSHA is retaining the existing references to the earlier ANSI standards, ANSI Z53.1-1967, Z35.1-1968 and Z35.2-1968, in its signage standards, thereby providing employers an option to comply with the updated or earlier standards. OSHA also is incorporating by reference Part VI of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (\u201cMUTCD\u201d), 1988 Edition, Revision 3, into the incorporation-by-reference section of the construction standards having inadvertently omitted this edition of the MUTCD from this section during an earlier rulemaking, and amending citations in two provisions of the construction standards to show the correct incorporation-by-reference section. In addition, OSHA is publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking in today's Federal Register adding the same references., 94316=\u00a7 1819, 52627=This document updates a non-mandatory appendix in OSHA's Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories Standard. The non-mandatory appendix is being updated to include the contents of the latest National Academy of Sciences publication entitled, \u201cPrudent Practices in the Laboratory: Handling and Management of Chemical Hazards,\u201d 2011 edition. All revisions being made are minor and non-substantive., 16176=On November 20, 2013, OSHA published in the Federal Register a direct final rule that revised records contained in the Mechanical Power Press Standard. OSHA stated in that document that it would withdraw the companion proposed rule and confirm the effective date of the final rule if the Agency received no significant adverse comments on the direct final rule or the proposal. Since OSHA received no such significant adverse comments on the direct final rule or the proposal, the Agency now confirms that the direct final rule became effective as a final rule on February 18, 2013., 104439=OSHA is extending the comment period on the Request for Information on Chemical Management and Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) to October 9, 2015.}",
