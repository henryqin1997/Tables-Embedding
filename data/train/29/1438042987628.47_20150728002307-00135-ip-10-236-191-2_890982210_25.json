    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{230758=To facilitate the potential application of energy conservation standards to special and definite purpose motors, DOE proposed to define such motors and provide certain preparatory test procedure steps. 78 FR 38456 (June 26, 2013). The definitions under consideration would address motors currently subject to standards, specific motors DOE is considering requiring to meet standards, and some motors that will continue to not be required to meet particular energy conservation standards. Some of the clarifying definitions, such as the definitions for NEMA Design A and C electric motors, come from NEMA Standards Publication MG 1-2009, \u201cMotors and Generators.\u201d DOE understands that some of the motors addressed, such as partial motors and integral brake motors, do not have standard industry-accepted definitions. For such motor types, DOE worked with subject-matter experts (SMEs), manufacturers, and the Motor Coalition to create the working definitions that are proposed in the test procedure NOPR. (8 FR 38456 (June 26, 2013)., 829428=Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001 (44 U.S.C. 3516, note) provides for Federal agencies to review most disseminations of information to the public under guidelines established by each agency pursuant to general guidelines issued by OMB. OMB's guidelines were published at 67 FR 8452 (Feb. 22, 2002), and DOE's guidelines were published at 67 FR 62446 (Oct. 7, 2002). DOE has reviewed today's NOPR under the OMB and DOE guidelines and has concluded that it is consistent with applicable policies in those guidelines., 629248=For the standard levels considered in the NOPR, DOE estimated indirect national employment impacts using an input/output model of the U.S. economy called Impact of Sector Energy Technologies, Version 3.1.1 (ImSET). ImSET is a special purpose version of the \u201cU.S. Benchmark National Input-Output\u201d (I-O) model, which was designed to estimate the national employment and income effects of energy-saving technologies. The ImSET software includes a computer-based I-O model having structural coefficients that characterize economic flows among the 187 sectors. ImSET's national economic I-O structure is based on a 2002 U.S. benchmark table, specially aggregated to the 187 sectors most relevant to industrial, commercial, and residential building energy use. DOE notes that ImSET is not a general equilibrium forecasting model, and understands the uncertainties involved in projecting employment impacts, especially changes in the later years of the analysis. Because ImSET does not incorporate price changes, the employment effects predicted by ImSET may over-estimate actual job impacts over the long run. For the NOPR, DOE used ImSET only to estimate short-term employment impacts., 481199=The conversion cost adder was only applied to ELs above NEMA Premium based on manufacturer feedback. Most manufacturers now offer NEMA Premium motors for a significant portion of their equipment lines as a result of EISA 2007, which required manufacturers to meet this level. Many manufacturers also offer certain ratings with efficiency levels higher than NEMA Premium. However, DOE is not aware of any manufacturer with a complete line of motors above NEMA Premium. Consequently, DOE believes that energy conservation standards above NEMA Premium would result in manufacturers incurring significant conversion costs to bring offerings of electric motors up to the higher standard., 853682=28. DOE solicits comment on the application of the new SCC values used to determine the social benefits of CO 2 emissions reductions over the rulemaking analysis period. (The rulemaking analysis period covers from 2015 to 2044 plus the appropriated number of years to account for the lifetime of the equipment purchased between 2015 and 2044.) In particular, the agency solicits comment on the agency's derivation of SCC values after 2050 where the agency applied the average annual growth rate of the SCC estimates in 2040-2050 associated with each of the four sets of values., 542319=For the NOPR, with the expanded scope by horsepower, DOE estimates total shipments in scope were 5.43 million units in 2011. This estimate represents an increase compared to the shipments estimated in the preliminary analysis because of the inclusion of integral brake motors and of NEMA integral enclosed 56-frame motors., 821178=With respect to the review of existing regulations and the promulgation of new regulations, section 3(a) of Executive Order 12988, \u201cCivil Justice Reform,\u201d imposes on Federal agencies the general duty to adhere to the following requirements: (1) Eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity; (2) write regulations to minimize litigation; and (3) provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard and promote simplification and burden reduction. 61 FR 4729 (Feb. 7, 1996). Section 3(b) of Executive Order 12988 specifically requires that Executive agencies make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: (1) Clearly specifies the preemptive effect, if any; (2) clearly specifies any effect on existing Federal law or regulation; (3) provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct while promoting simplification and burden reduction; (4) specifies the retroactive effect, if any; (5) adequately defines key terms; and (6) addresses other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship under any guidelines issued by the Attorney General. Section 3(c) of Executive Order 12988 requires Executive agencies to review regulations in light of applicable standards in section 3(a) and section 3(b) to determine whether they are met or it is unreasonable to meet one or more of them. DOE has completed the required review and determined that, to the extent permitted by law, this proposed rule meets the relevant standards of Executive Order 12988., 962694=89. DOE used a two-step calculation process to convert the time-series of costs and benefits into annualized values. First, DOE calculated a present value in 2013, the year used for discounting the NPV of total consumer costs and savings, for the time-series of costs and benefits using discount rates of three and seven percent for all costs and benefits except for the value of CO 2 reductions. For the latter, DOE used a range of discount rates, as shown in Table I.3. From the present value, DOE then calculated the fixed annual payment over a 30-year period (2015 through 2044) that yields the same present value. The fixed annual payment is the annualized value. Although DOE calculated annualized values, this does not imply that the time-series of cost and benefits from which the annualized values were determined is a steady stream of payments., 471318=DOE conducted the engineering analysis using material prices based on manufacturer feedback, industry experts, and publicly available data. In the preliminary analysis, most material prices were based on 2011 prices, with the exception of cast copper and copper wire pricing, which were based on a five-year (2007-2011) average price., 605953=Under section 1(b)(6) of Executive Order 12866, \u201cRegulatory Planning and Review,\u201d 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993), agencies must, to the extent permitted by law, assess both the costs and the benefits of the intended regulation and, recognizing that some costs and benefits are difficult to quantify, propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. The purpose of the SCC estimates presented here is to allow agencies to incorporate the monetized social benefits of reducing CO 2 emissions into cost-benefit analyses of regulatory actions that have small, or \u201cmarginal,\u201d impacts on cumulative global emissions. The estimates are presented with an acknowledgement of the many uncertainties involved and with a clear understanding that they should be updated over time to reflect increasing knowledge of the science and economics of climate impacts., 502670=Nidec commented during the public meeting that scaling has too many variables, and that manufacturers do not use scaling because it is not possible. (Nidec, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at pp. 198-199) ACEEE added that there is no underlying fundamental physical theory associated with the efficiencies listed in NEMA MG 1-2011 Table 12-11 or Table 12-12. (ACEEE, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at pp. 198-199), 272515=In view of DOE's proposed approach described in Table IV.3, DOE is proposing to include certain motor types that some interested parties have suggested that DOE continue to exclude from any energy efficiency requirements. For example, the Motor Coalition would exclude integral brake motors from coverage, as DOE once did through policy guidance, see 62 FR 59978 (November 5, 1997), but which was subsequently removed. See 77 FR 26638 (May 4, 2012). (Motor Coalition, No. 35 at p. 3) SEW-Eurodrive also commented that there are two basic types of integral gearmotor: (1) One that meets the definition in DOE's preliminary analysis, and (2) another having a special shaft or mounting configuration. SEW-Eurodrive contended that the second type of integral gearmotor would require replacement of the entire rotor shaft and rotor cage to be tested. (SEWE, No. 53, p. 3), 528812=For each representative motor, DOE assigned electricity prices using a Monte Carlo approach that incorporated weightings based on the estimated share of electric motors in each region. The regional shares were derived based on indicators specific to each sector (e.g., commercial floor space from the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey for the commercial sector [70] ) and assumed to remain constant over time. To estimate future trends in energy prices, DOE used projections from the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2011 (AEO 2011). The NOPR retains the same approach for determining electricity prices, and used AEO 2013 to project electricity price trends., 208061=DOE received several comments from NEMA regarding the December 19, 2015, compliance date. First, NEMA pointed out that all publications and presentations prior to that preliminary analysis public meeting on August 21, 2012, indicated that DOE's statutory deadline for any final rule was December 19, 2012, but at the public meeting DOE showed a final rule completion date as the end of 2013. (NEMA, No. 54 at pp. 2, 6-7) NEMA questioned the authority by which DOE has decided to delay the Final Rule beyond the date of December 19, 2012, as stipulated in EPCA. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 2), 511277=IECA commented that the database of plant assessments is based on surveys conducted between 2005 and 2011 and there is no explanation of the effects of the recession on these surveys. (IECA, No. 52 at p. 2) DOE could not estimate the impact of the recession on the average operating hour values derived from the database of field assessment from the Washington State University and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, as the year of the assessment was not specified for all of the entries. The additional data from the Industrial Assessment Center cover a longer time period (1987-2007). Thus, DOE believes that its estimates of operating hours are not unduly affected by lower industrial activity during the recession., 380714=NEMA also commented that it is not uncommon for a manufacturer to use the same stator lamination design for all horsepower ratings built in the same NEMA MG 1-2011 Standard frame series. NEMA indicated that a high slot fill may require hand winding for one of the ratings and automated winding for the other rating, and that a good design practice for stator laminations will take into consideration more than just one motor rating to determine the best design for all ratings in that frame series. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 59), 372767=BBF commented that, with the extensive capabilities of copper die-cast rotors and commercial availability of copper die-cast rotors with efficiencies higher than NEMA MG 1-2011 Table 12-12 efficiencies, DOE should include in its evaluations copper die-cast rotor motors. BBF also added that they strongly disagree with the NEMA representatives' contrary verbal suggestions towards copper rotor motor technology presented during the public meeting. (BBF, No. 51 at p. 4), 205850=DOE received numerous comments from interested parties who provided significant input to DOE in response to the framework document and preliminary analysis that the agency had issued. See 75 FR 59657 (Sept. 28, 2010) (framework document notice of availability) and 77 FR 43015 (July 23, 2012) (preliminary analysis notice of availability). During the framework document comment period for this rulemaking, several interested parties urged DOE to consider including additional motor types currently without energy conservation standards in DOE's analyses and establishing standards for such motor types. In the commenters' view, this approach would more effectively increase energy savings than setting more stringent standards for currently regulated electric motors. In response, DOE published a Request for Information (RFI) seeking public comments from interested parties regarding establishment of energy conservation standards for several types of definite and special purpose motors for which EISA 2007 did not provide energy conservation standards. 76 FR 17577 (March 30, 2011). DOE received comments responding to the RFI advocating that DOE regulate many of the electric motors discussed in the RFI, as well as many additional motor types., 441596=Whenever possible, DOE attempted to base its engineering analysis on actual electric motors being produced and sold in the market today. First, DOE identified electric motors in manufacturer catalogs that represented a range of efficiencies corresponding to the ELs discussed in the previous sections. Next, DOE had the electric motors shipped to a certified testing laboratory where each was tested in accordance with IEEE Standard 112 (Test Method B) to verify its nameplate-rated efficiency. After testing, DOE derived production and material costs by having a professional motor laboratory [57] disassemble and inventory the purchased electric motors. For ECG 1, DOE obtained tear-down results for all of the 5-horsepower ELs and all of the 30- and 75-horsepower ELs except the max-tech levels. For ECG 2, DOE obtained tear-down results only for the baseline EL, which corresponds to EPACT 1992 efficiency levels., 930714=21. The EIA allows the use of the name \u201cNEMS\u201d to describe only an AEO version of the model without any modification to code or data. Because the present analysis entails some minor code modifications and runs the model under various policy scenarios that deviate from AEO assumptions, the name \u201cNEMS-BT\u201d refers to the model as used here. For more information on NEMS, refer to The National Energy Modeling System: An Overview, DOE/EIA-0581 (98) (Feb. 1998), available at: http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/FTPROOT/forecasting/058198.pdf., 363483=Regarding DOE's projections that the annual sales of electric motors, as defined by EISA 2007 will have grown to 5,089,000 units by 2015, including over 24,000 possible motor configurations, NEMA commented that only a single manufacturer is currently producing die-cast copper rotor motors, and in a very limited range. In its view, without sufficient data and analysis to support DOE's conclusion that \u201cmass production\u201d of die-cast copper rotors is possible, NEMA asserts that this technology would not pass the screening criterion of practicability to manufacture, install, and service. It argues that, based on the limited advances of the technology from 1995 to present day in the United States, this technology is unlikely to be mature enough by the compliance date for this rulemaking to meet the required production of over 5 million motors in the U.S., even if all manufacturing were shifted overseas. (NEMA, No. 54 at pp. 3, 47, 53, 54, 56; NEMA, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at p. 114) NEMA noted that mandating this technology may also have the indirect effect of establishing a monopoly market in the U.S. for those manufacturers who can produce copper rotor motors, or to push production jobs overseas and penalize motor manufacturers that do not have the capability to produce copper rotor motors. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 24), 823045=Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) requires each Federal agency to assess the effects of Federal regulatory actions on State, local, and Tribal governments and the private sector. Public Law 104-4, sec. 201 (codified at 2 U.S.C. 1531). For a proposed regulatory action likely to result in a rule that may cause the expenditure by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100 million or more in any one year (adjusted annually for inflation), section 202 of UMRA requires a Federal agency to publish a written statement that estimates the resulting costs, benefits, and other effects on the national economy. (2 U.S.C. 1532(a), (b)) The UMRA also requires a Federal agency to develop an effective process to permit timely input by elected officers of State, local, and Tribal governments on a proposed \u201csignificant intergovernmental mandate,\u201d and requires an agency plan for giving notice and opportunity for timely input to potentially affected small governments before establishing any requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small governments. On March 18, 1997, DOE published a statement of policy on its process for intergovernmental consultation under UMRA. 62 FR 12820. DOE's policy statement is also available at http://energy.gov/gc/downloads/unfunded-mandates-reform-act-intergovernmental-consultation., 76507=The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended, prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including commercial and industrial electric motors. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would save a significant amount of energy. In this notice, DOE proposes energy conservation standards for a number of different groups of electric motors that DOE has not previously regulated. For those groups of electric motors currently regulated, the proposed standards would maintain the current energy conservation standards for some electric motor types and amend the energy conservation standards for other electric motor types. The document also announces a public meeting to receive comment on these proposed standards and associated analyses and results., 128143=D. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 957482=80. See Average Fuel Economy Standards, Passenger Cars and Light Trucks, Model Years 2011-2015, 73 FR 24352 (May 2, 2008) (Proposed Rule); Draft Environmental Impact Statement Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards, Passenger Cars and Light Trucks, Model Years 2011-2015 at 3-58 (June 2008) (Available at: http://www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy) (Last accessed December 2012)., 410773=DOE also notes that section 13 of NEMA MG 1-2011 does not standardize frame series for NEMA Design B motors at the highest horsepower levels covered in today's proposal. Therefore, motors with the highest capacity have variability in their frame series. This added flexibility would give manufacturers more options to improve the efficiency of their largest motors covered by this rulemaking. Although altering the frame size of a motor may be costly, DOE believes that its selection of a 75-hp representative unit for higher horsepower motors is appropriate for scaling higher horsepower efficiency levels and the efficiency levels examined are technologically feasible for the largest capacity motors., 793461=In addition, DOE has determined that today's regulatory action is an \u201ceconomically significant regulatory action\u201d under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, section 6(a)(3) of the Executive Order requires that DOE prepare a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) on today's rule and that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review this rule. DOE presented to OIRA for review the draft rule and other documents prepared for this rulemaking, including the RIA, and has included these documents in the rulemaking record. The assessments prepared pursuant to Executive Order 12866 can be found in the technical support document for this rulemaking., 289295=EISA 2007 prescribed energy conservation standards for electric motors built with a U-frame, whereas previously only electric motors built with a T-frame were covered. [30] (Compare 42 U.S.C. 6311(13)(A)(1992) with 42 U.S.C. 6311(13)(B)(2011)) In general, for the same combination of horsepower rating and pole configuration, an electric motor built in a U-frame is built with a larger \u201cD\u201d dimension than an electric motor built in a T-frame. The \u201cD\u201d dimension is a measurement of the distance from the centerline of the shaft to the bottom of the mounting feet. Consequently, U-frame motors should be able to reach efficiencies as high, or higher, than T-frame motors with similar ratings (i.e., horsepower, pole-configuration, and enclosure) because the larger frame size allows for more active materials, such as copper wiring and electrical steel, which help reduce I2R (i.e., losses arising from the resistivity of the current-carrying material) and core losses (losses that result from magnetic field stability changes). Furthermore,U-frame motors do not have any unique utility relative to comparable T-frame motors. In general, a T-frame design could replace an equivalent U-frame design with minor modification of the mounting configuration for the driven equipment. By comparison, a U-frame design that is equivalent to a T-frame design could require substantial modification to the mounting configuration for the same piece of driven equipment because of its larger size. DOE's research indicated that manufacturers sell conversion brackets for installing T-frame motors into applications where a U-frame motor had previously been used. [31], 373282=DOE is aware of the higher melting point of copper (1084 degrees Celsius versus 660 degrees Celsius for aluminum) and the potential impacts this may have on the health or safety of plant workers. However, DOE does not believe at this time that this potential impact is sufficiently adverse to screen out copper as a die cast material for rotor conductors. The process for die casting copper rotors involves risks similar to those of die casting aluminum. DOE believes that manufacturers who die-cast metal at 660 Celsius or 1085 Celsius (the respective temperatures required for aluminum and copper) would need to observe strict protocols to operate safely. DOE understands that many plants already work with molten aluminum die casting processes and believes that similar processes could be adopted for copper. DOE has not received any supporting data about the increased risks associated with copper die casting, and could not locate any studies suggesting that the die-casting of copper inherently represented incrementally more risks to worker safety and health. DOE notes that several OSHA standards relate to the safety of \u201cNonferrous Die-Castings, Except Aluminum,\u201d of which die-cast copper is part. DOE seeks comment on any adverse safety or health impacts and on these OSHA standards, [49] and on any other specific information document the safety of die-casting for both copper and aluminum., 832180=On December 16, 2004, OMB, in consultation with the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), issued its Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review (the Bulletin). 70 FR 2664 (Jan. 14, 2005). The Bulletin establishes that certain scientific information shall be peer reviewed by qualified specialists before it is disseminated by the Federal Government, including influential scientific information related to agency regulatory actions. The purpose of the bulletin is to enhance the quality and credibility of the Government's scientific information. Under the Bulletin, the energy conservation standards rulemaking analyses are \u201cinfluential scientific information,\u201d which the Bulletin defines as scientific information the agency reasonably can determine will have, or does have, a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private sector decisions. 70 FR 2667., 209275=Third, NEMA also noted that when EPACT 1992 first added electric motors as covered equipment, motor manufacturers were allowed five years to modify motor designs and certify compliance to the new standards. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 7) It further noted that NEMA MG 1-1998 subsequently introduced NEMA Premium efficiency standards, and between 1998 and 2007 manufacturers voluntarily increased the number of NEMA Premium efficiency motor models available. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 7) NEMA commented that this transition period eased the burden of satisfying the added stringency of the standards set by EISA 2007, which allowed three years to update energy conservation standards to mandatory NEMA Premium levels for certain motor ratings. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 7) NEMA added that adhering to the statutory deadline for setting any new and amended standards would minimize any disruption in the electric motor market. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 8) NEMA also commented that since the EISA 2007 standards were enacted, only a limited number of motor ratings above NEMA Premium have been offered because there is not sufficient space available in most frame ratings to increase the efficiency. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 7) NEMA added that any standards above NEMA Premium would force manufacturers to redesign entire product lines and go through the process of certification and compliance, all of which would be expected to take longer than three years. (NEMA, No. 54 at pp. 7, 8), 674032=DOE quantitatively assessed the impact of potential new and amended energy conservation standards on direct employment. DOE used the GRIM to estimate the domestic labor expenditures and number of domestic production workers in the base case and at each TSL from the announcement of any potential new and amended energy conservation standards in 2013 to the end of the analysis period in 2044. DOE used statistical data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2011 Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM), the results of the engineering analysis, and interviews with manufacturers to determine the inputs necessary to calculate industry-wide labor expenditures and domestic employment levels. Labor expenditures involved with the manufacturing of electric motors are a function of the labor intensity of the product, the sales volume, and an assumption that wages remain fixed in real terms over time., 274800=ACEEE supported the Motor Coalition's Petition in its approach to expand the scope of covered motors to comply with the energy efficiency levels found in Table 12-12 of NEMA Standards Publication MG 1-2011. According to ACEEE, such approach could be easily accomplished by manufacturers and, at the same time, allow them to refocus resources on designing and building the next generation of electric motor. (ACEEE, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at pp. 18, 19) UL agreed with the ACEEE approach and suggested that DOE clarify the scope of coverage with a statement whereby all electric motors are subject to standards, except for those specifically mentioned as excluded. (UL, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at pp. 60, 61) Finally, the California Independently Owned Utilities (CA IOUs) submitted similar comments, suggesting that DOE expand the scope of coverage and explicitly define those motor types excluded from standards. The CA IOUs stressed that this approach would provide clarity both to compliance and enforcement efforts by government agencies and manufacturers. (CA IOUs, No. 57 atp. 1), 581910=During the August 2012 preliminary analysis public meeting, interested parties commented on the assumptions and results of the preliminary analysis TSD. Oral and written comments addressed several topics, including the scope of coverage, conversion costs, enforcement of standards, and the potential increase in the motor refurbishment market. DOE addresses these comments below., 520400=In the preliminary analysis, the engineering analysis showed that for some representative units, increased efficiency led to increased stack length. However, the electric motor frame remained in the same NEMA frame size requirements as the baseline electric motor, and the motor's \u201cC\u201d dimension remained fairly constant across efficiency levels. In addition, electric motor installation cost data from RS Means Electrical Cost Data 2013 showed a variation in installation costs by horsepower (for three-phase electric motors), but not by efficiency. Therefore, in the preliminary analysis, DOE assumed there is no variation in installation costs between a baseline efficiency electric motor and a higher efficiency electric motor., 307785=EISA 2007 prescribes separate energy conservation standards for open and enclosed electric motors. (42 U.S.C. 6313(b)(1)) Electric motors manufactured with open construction allow a free interchange of air between the electric motor's interior and exterior. Electric motors with enclosed construction have no direct air interchange between the motor's interior and exterior (but are not necessarily air-tight) and may be equipped with an internal fan for cooling (see NEMA MG 1-2011, paragraph 1.26). Whether an electric motor is open or enclosed affects its utility; open motors are generally not used in harsh operating environments, whereas totally enclosed electric motors often are. The enclosure type also affects an electric motor's ability to dissipate heat, which directly affects efficiency. For these reasons, DOE used an electric motor's enclosure type (open or enclosed) as an equipment class setting criterion in the preliminary analysis., 792534=Section 1(b)(1) of Executive Order 12866, \u201cRegulatory Planning and Review,\u201d 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993), requires each agency to identify the problem that it intends to address, including, where applicable, the failures of private markets or public institutions that warrant new agency action, as well as to assess the significance of that problem. The problems that today's standards address are as follows:, 273539=In view of the foregoing, DOE continues to believe that consistent and repeatable test procedures can be prescribed for integral brake motors, integral gearmotors, integral partial motors, and partial \u00be motors. See 78 FR 38456 (June 26, 2013). In particular, DOE believes that an integral brake motor that meets the nine criteria in Table IV.2, could be readily tested and satisfy the proposed standards. In addition, DOE believes that the definition for \u201cpartial electric motor\u201d and \u201ccomponent set\u201d proposed in its June test procedure NOPR will clarify what types of items would meet these definitions, which should help manufacturers determine whether the equipment they manufacture fall under these terms. See 78 FR 38456 (June 26, 2013). Furthermore, DOE believes that the type of integral gearmotor addressed by SEW-Eurodrive (i.e., with a special shaft or mounting configuration) would likely satisfy DOE's proposed definition of component set, because it would require more than the addition of end shields and a bearing to create an operable motor. (Component sets would not be required to meet standards under today's proposal), 689579=For each TSL, DOE projected energy savings for electric motors purchased in the 30-year period that begins in the year of compliance with new and amended standards (2015-2044). The savings are measured over the entire lifetime of equipment purchased in the 30-year period. DOE quantified the energy savings attributable to each TSL as the difference in energy consumption between each standards case and the base case. Table V.13 presents the estimated primary energy savings for each considered TSL, and Table V.14 presents the estimated FFC energy savings for each considered TSL. The approach for estimating national energy savings is further described in section IV.H., 168016=In addition, the proposed standards would have significant environmental benefits. Estimated energy savings would result in cumulative emission reductions of 396 million metric tons (Mt) [6] of carbon dioxide (CO 2), 674 thousand tons of sulfur dioxide (SO 2), 499 thousand tons of nitrogen oxides (NO X) and 0.8 tons of mercury (Hg). [7] Through 2030, the estimated energy savings would result in cumulative emissions reductions of 96 Mt of CO 2., 429557=For ECG 2, DOE took a similar approach in developing its ELs as it did for ECG 1, but with two primary differences. First, when DOE examined catalog data, it found that no NEMA Design C electric motors had efficiencies below EPACT 1992 levels, which is the current standard for all covered NEMA Design C electric motors. For DOE's representative units, it also found no catalog listings above the required EPACT 1992 levels. Additionally, when DOE's subject matter expert modeled NEMA Design C motors, the model would only generate designs at NEMA Premium levels and one incremental level above that while maintaining proper performance standards. Therefore, ECG 2 only contains three ELs: EPACT 1992 (EL 0), NEMA Premium (EL 1), and a max-tech level (EL 2)., 729232=Although adding the value of customer savings to the values of emission reductions provides a valuable perspective, two issues should be considered. First, the national operating cost savings are domestic U.S. customer monetary savings that occur as a result of market transactions, while the value of CO 2 reductions is based on a global value. Second, the assessments of operating cost savings and the SCC are performed with different methods that use quite different time frames for analysis. The national operating cost savings is measured for the lifetime of equipment shipped in 2015-2044. The SCC values, on the other hand, reflect the present value of future climate-related impacts resulting from the emission of one metric ton of CO 2 in each year. These impacts continue well beyond 2100., 781246=The benefits and costs of today's proposed standards, for equipment sold in 2015-2044, can also be expressed in terms of annualized values. The annualized monetary values are the sum of: (1) The annualized national economic value of the benefits from consumer operation of equipment that meet the proposed standards (consisting primarily of operating cost savings from using less energy, minus increases in equipment purchase and installation costs, which is another way of representing consumer NPV), and (2) the annualized monetary value of the benefits of emission reductions, including CO 2 emission reductions. [89], 833191=In response to OMB's Bulletin, DOE conducted formal in-progress peer reviews of the energy conservation standards development process and analyses and has prepared a Peer Review Report pertaining to the energy conservation standards rulemaking analyses. Generation of this report involved a rigorous, formal, and documented evaluation using objective criteria and qualified and independent reviewers to make a judgment as to the technical/scientific/business merit, the actual or anticipated results, and the productivity and management effectiveness of programs and/or projects. The \u201cEnergy Conservation Standards Rulemaking Peer Review Report\u201d dated February 2007 has been disseminated and is available at the following Web site: www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/peer_review.html., 942154=47. http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2012-coppe.pdf., 526452=In the preliminary analysis, DOE assumed that one-third of repairs are done following industry recommended practice as defined by EASA. (EASA Standard AR100-2010, Recommended Practice for the Repair of Rotating Electrical Apparatus) and do not impact the efficiency of the electric motor (i.e., no degradation of efficiency after repair). DOE assumed that two-thirds of repairs do not follow good practice and that a slight decrease in efficiency occurs when the electric motor is repaired. DOE assumed the efficiency decreases by 1 percent in the case of electric motors of less than 40 horsepower, and by 0.5 percent in the case of larger electric motors., 698632=Table V.16 shows the customer NPV results for each TSL considered for electric motors. In each case, the impacts cover the lifetime of equipment purchased in 2015-2044., 796790=The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires preparation of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) for any rule that by law must be proposed for public comment, unless the agency certifies that the rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As required by Executive Order 13272, \u201cProper Consideration of Small Entities in Agency Rulemaking,\u201d 67 FR 53461 (August 16, 2002), DOE published procedures and policies on February 19, 2003, to ensure that the potential impacts of its rules on small entities are properly considered during the rulemaking process. 68 FR 7990 DOE has made its procedures and policies available on the Office of the General Counsel's Web site (http://energy.gov/gc/office-general-counsel)., 295700=The first criterion that DOE considered when disaggregating equipment class groups was based on the NEMA (and IEC) design letter. The NEMA Standards Publication MG 1-2011, \u201cMotors and Generators,\u201d defines a series of standard electric motor designs that are differentiated by variations in performance requirements. These designs are designated by letter\u2014Designs A, B, and C. (See NEMA MG 1-2011, paragraph 1.19.1). These designs are categorized by performance requirements for full-voltage starting and developing locked-rotor torque, breakdown torque, and locked-rotor current, all of which affect an electric motor's utility and efficiency. DOE is proposing to regulate the efficiency of each of these design types., 919292=3. All monetary values in this section are expressed in 2012 dollars and are discounted to 2013., 623101=In summary, in considering the potential global benefits resulting from reduced CO 2 emissions resulting from today's rule, DOE used the values from the 2013 interagency report, adjusted to 2012$ using the Gross Domestic Product price deflator. For each of the four cases specified, the values used for emissions in 2015 were $11.8, $39.7, $61.2, and $117 per metric ton avoided (values expressed in 2012$). DOE derived values after 2050 using the relevant growth rate for the 2040-2050 period in the interagency update., 270451=In view of Table IV.2, Table IV.3 lists the various electric motor types that would be covered by DOE's proposed approach. Further details and definitions for the motor types can be found in DOE's electric motors test procedure NOPR, which was published on June 26, 2013 (78 FR 38456)., 903000=(j) Starting on December 19, 2015, each fire pump electric motor meeting the criteria in paragraph (g) of this section and with a power rating of 1 horsepower through 500 horsepower, manufactured (alone or as a component of another piece of equipment) shall have a nominal full-load efficiency that is not less than the following:, 112790=A link to the docket Web page can be found at http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=EERE-2010-BT-STD-0027. This Web page will contain a link to the docket for this notice on the regulations.gov site. The regulations.gov Web page will contain simple instructions on how to access all documents, including public comments, in the docket. See section VII for further information on how to submit comments through www.regulations.gov., 212939=The compliance date prescribed by statute would require manufacturers to begin manufacturing compliant motors by December 19, 2015. Accordingly, DOE is proposing a December 19, 2015, compliance date. DOE, however, recognizes that the statute also contemplated a three-year lead time for manufacturers in order to account for the potential logistical and production hurdles that manufacturers may face when transitioning to the new standards. Accordingly, while DOE is proposing a December 19, 2015 compliance deadline, it is also interested in comments that detail any hurdles with meeting this compliance deadline along with the merits of receiving the three-year lead-time also set out in the statute., 128741=I. Review Under Executive Order 12630, 408533=While DOE agrees with NEMA that the 5-horsepower electric motor was not the only choice for the representative unit, it selected the 5-horsepower motor for multiple reasons. The 5-horsepower unit had the highest percentage of shipments for all covered electric motors, which ensured that there would be multiple efficiency levels from multiple manufacturers available for comparison during the teardown analysis. In addition, because DOE later employed scaling, it attempted to find a frame series and D-dimension [52] that could serve as a strong basis from which to scale to a relatively small set of unanalyzed frame series. The standard NEMA MG 1-2011 frame series for the 5-horsepower enclosed motor was a midpoint between the standard frame series for 1 horsepower and 10-horsepower motors, which was the group of ratings covered by the 5- horsepower representative unit. A larger representative unit would have meant a larger range of frame series on which to apply the scaling methodology., 825896=Section 202 of UMRA authorizes a Federal agency to respond to the content requirements of UMRA in any other statement or analysis that accompanies the proposed rule. 2 U.S.C. 1532(c). The content requirements of section 202(b) of UMRA relevant to a private sector mandate substantially overlap the economic analysis requirements that apply under section 325(o) of EPCA and Executive Order 12866. The SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of the NOPR and the \u201cRegulatory Impact Analysis\u201d section of the TSD for this proposed rule respond to those requirements., 551087=In the preliminary analysis, DOE did not include any change in base case efficiency in its shipments and national energy savings models. As explained in section IV.F, for equipment class groups 1 and 4, for the NOPR, DOE presumed that the efficiency distributions in the base case change over time. The projected share of 1 to 5 horsepower NEMA Premium motors (EL 2) for equipment class group 1 grows from 36.6 percent to 45.5 percent over the analysis period, and for equipment class group 4, it grows from 30.0 percent to 38.9 percent. For equipment class group 2 and 3, DOE assumed that the efficiency remains constant from 2015 to 2044., 676193=The employment impacts shown in the tables below represent the potential production employment impact resulting from new and amended energy conservation standards. The upper bound of the results estimates the maximum change in the number of production workers that could occur after compliance with new and amended energy conservation standards when assuming that manufacturers continue to produce the same scope of covered equipment in the same production facilities. It also assumes that domestic production does not shift to lower-labor-cost countries. Because there is a real risk of manufacturers evaluating sourcing decisions in response to new and amended energy conservation standards, the lower bound of the employment results includes the estimated total number of U.S. production workers in the industry who could lose their jobs if all existing production were moved outside of the U.S. While the results present a range of employment impacts following 2015, the sections below also include qualitative discussions of the likelihood of negative employment impacts at the various TSLs. Finally, the employment impacts shown are independent of the indirect employment impacts from the broader U.S. economy, which are documented in chapter 16 of the NOPR TSD., 515678=IECA commented that estimates of regional shares of motors should be based on current inventories of motors rather than sector-specific indicators and that the data from the 2006 Manufacturer Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) is outdated. (IECA, No. 52 at p. 2) DOE did not find any information regarding motor inventory and instead used indirect indicators to derive motor distribution. For the NOPR, DOE updated its regional shares of motors based on industrial electricity consumption by region from AEO 2013., 210773=Finally, NEMA also attempted to illustrate the difficulty of reaching NEMA Premium levels in IEC frame motors, noting that a comparison of certificates of compliance before and after EISA 2007 standards went into effect would demonstrate that some manufacturers were forced to abandon the U.S. electric motor market for some period of time before they could update their IEC frame motor product line. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 8) NEMA added that increasing the efficiency of subtype II motors to NEMA Premium efficiency and expanding the scope of motors subject to energy conservation standards (many of which currently have efficiency levels below EPACT 1992 energy conservation levels) will also require extensive redesign, and manufacturers would be forced to comply in only three years. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 8), 417136=As discussed in section IV.C.8, DOE has used the simpler of two scaling approaches presented in the preliminary analysis because both methods had similar results. This simpler approach does not require DOE to develop a relationship for 4-pole motors from which to scale. Furthermore, DOE notes that the scaling approach it selected mirrors the scaling laid out in NEMA's MG 1-2011 tables, in which at least a subset of the motors industry has already presented a possible relationship between efficiency and pole count. DOE has continued to analyze 4-pole electric motors because they are the most common and DOE believes that all of the efficiency levels it has developed are technologically feasible., 53020=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 951205=68.

Bureau of Economic Analysis (March 01, 2012), Private Fixed Investment in Equipment and Software by Type and Private Fixed Investment in Structures by Type. http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=12&amp;step=1., 370670=NEMA commented that the preliminary TSD does not sufficiently explain how DOE concluded that mandating performance levels that would require copper rotor die-casting would not have an adverse impact on health or safety, with the implication being on occupational health and safety. NEMA commented that the preliminary TSD mentioned potential impacts on the health or safety caused by the higher melting point of copper, but DOE did not elaborate on what these potential impacts were. NEMA disagreed with DOE's conclusion not to screen out die-cast copper rotor technology on the premise that handling molten copper is similar to handling molten aluminum. NEMA noted that copper has a pouring temperature of 2100 degrees Fahrenheit and a 150 percent higher casting pressure than aluminum, and that, combined, these two characteristics would increase the severity of any potential accidents. NEMA mentions an incident involving the two U.S. Army die-cast copper rotor studies previously mentioned, which resulted in injuries during the die-casting of aluminum [48] [sic] cage rotors and caused the only U.S. manufacturer of copper die-casting equipment to withdraw that equipment from the market. NEMA added that the equipment currently remains unavailable for purchase. (NEMA, No. 54 at pp. 10, 55, 56; NEMA, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at p. 115) NEMA added that, especially regarding die-casting copper on larger motor sizes, DOE cannot justifiably claim that there are no adverse impacts on health or safety until they conduct a thorough investigation or feasibility study regarding this topic. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 3), 932230=24. The Petition is available at: http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EERE-2010-BT-STD-0027-0035., 921948=10. DOE used a two-step calculation process to convert the time-series of costs and benefits into annualized values. First, DOE calculated a present value in 2013, the year used for discounting the NPV of total consumer costs and savings, for the time-series of costs and benefits using discount rates of three and seven percent for all costs and benefits except for the value of CO 2 reductions. For the latter, DOE used a range of discount rates, as shown in Table I.3. From the present value, DOE then calculated the fixed annual payment over a 30-year period (2015 through 2044) that yields the same present value. The fixed annual payment is the annualized value. Although DOE calculated annualized values, this does not imply that the time-series of cost and benefits from which the annualized values were determined is a steady stream of payments., 881060=(d) Each NEMA Design B or an equivalent IEC Design N motor that is a general purpose electric motor (subtype I) or general purpose electric motor (subtype II), excluding fire pump electric motors, with a power rating of more than 200 horsepower, but not greater than 500 horsepower, manufactured (alone or as a component of another piece of equipment) on or after December 19, 2010, but before December 19, 2015 shall have a nominal full-load efficiency that is not less than the following:, 255267=DOE understands that an IEC frame motor could be treated as either a subtype I or subtype II motor depending on its other characteristics. Having an IEC frame alone does not dictate whether a motor is a general purpose subtype I or subtype II motor; rather, other physical characteristics, such as equivalency to a NEMA Design A, B, or C electric motor, and whether it has mounting feet could determine the subtype designation and associated energy efficiency standard level. All of these elements flow directly from the statutory changes enacted by EISA 2007. (See EISA 2007, sec. 313(a)(3), codified at 42 U.S.C. 6311(13)) Currently, electric motors are required to meet energy conservation standards as follows:, 225615=Although DOE believes that EPCA, as amended through EISA 2007, provides sufficient statutory authority for the regulation of special purpose and definite purpose motors as \u201celectric motors,\u201d DOE notes it has additional authority under section 10 of the American Energy Manufacturing Technical Corrections Act, Public Law 112-210, which amended DOE's authority to regulate commercial and industrial equipment under section 340(2)(B) of EPCA to include \u201cother motors,\u201d in addition to \u201celectric motors\u201d. (42 U.S.C. 6311(2)(B)(xiii)). Therefore, even if special and definite purpose motors were not \u201celectric motors,\u201d special and definite purpose motors would be considered as \u201cother motors\u201d that EPCA already treats as covered industrial equipment. [15], 887242=(h) Starting on December 19, 2015, each NEMA Design A and NEMA Design B motor that is an electric motor meeting the criteria in paragraph (g) of this section and with a power rating from 1 horsepower through 500 horsepower, but excluding fire pump electric motors, integral-brake electric motors, and non-integral brake electric motors, manufactured (alone or as a component of another piece of equipment) shall have a nominal full-load efficiency of not less than the following:, 128515=G. Review Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 500151=For the higher ELs in ECG 1, DOE's scaling approach relies on NEMA MG 1-2011 Table 12-10 of nominal efficiencies and the relative improvement in motor losses of the representative units. As has been discussed, each incremental improvement in NEMA nominal efficiency (or NEMA band) corresponds to roughly a 10 percent reduction in motor losses. After ELs 3 and 4 were developed for each representative unit, DOE applied the same reduction in motor losses (or the same number of NEMA band improvements) to various segments of the market based on its representative units. DOE assigned a segment of the electric motors market, based on horsepower ratings, to each representative unit analyzed. DOE's assignments of these segments of the markets were in part based on the standardized NEMA frame number series that NEMA MG 1-2011 assigns to horsepower and pole combinations. In the end, EL 3 corresponded to a one band improvement relative to NEMA Premium and EL 4 corresponded to a two-band improvement relative to NEMA Premium. In response to the preliminary analysis, DOE received multiple comments regarding scaling., 111307=4.

The meeting will also be broadcast as a webinar. See section VII Public Participation for webinar registration information, participant instructions, and information about the capabilities available to webinar participants., 701964=The NPV results based on the afore-mentioned 9-year analytical period are presented in Table V.17. The impacts are counted over the lifetime of equipment purchased in 2015-2023. As mentioned previously, this information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of any change in DOE's analytical methodology or decision criteria., 221265=On June 26, 2013, DOE published a notice that proposed to incorporate definitions for certain motor types not currently subject to energy conservation standards (78 FR 38456). The notice also proposed to clarify several definitions for motor types currently regulated by energy conservation standards and adding some necessary steps to facilitate the testing of certain motor types that DOE does not currently require to meet standards. During its preliminary analysis stage, DOE received comments concerning definitions and test procedure set-up steps suggested for testing motors under an expanded scope approach. DOE addressed the comments as part of the test procedure NOPR. For additional details, see 78 FR 38456 (June 26, 2013)., 816593=Manufacturers of electric motors that are currently subject to energy conservation standards must certify to DOE that their equipment comply with any applicable energy conservation standards. In certifying compliance, manufacturers must test their equipment according to the DOE test procedures for electric motors, including any amendments adopted for those test procedures. The collection-of-information requirement for the certification and recordkeeping is subject to review and approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). This requirement has been approved by OMB under OMB control number 1910-1400. Public reporting burden for the certification is estimated to average 20 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. DOE intends to address revised certification requirements for electric motors in a separate rulemaking., 349467=DOE acknowledges that using copper in rotors may require different design approaches and considerations. In its own modeling and testing of copper rotor motors, DOE ensured that performance parameters stayed within MG 1-2011 limits (i.e., met NEMA Design B criteria). DOE seeks comment on any particular aspects of copper rotor design, especially those on parameters widely viewed as challenging to meet, and requests explanation of why such parameters are especially challenging when using copper., 937510=35.

First, the national operating savings are domestic U.S. consumer monetary savings that occur as a result of market transactions while the value of CO 2 reductions is based on a global value. Second, the assessments of operating cost savings and CO 2 savings are performed with different methods that use different time frames for analysis. The national operating cost savings is measured over the lifetime of electric motors shipped in years 2015-2044. The SCC values, on the other hand, reflect the present value of some future climate-related impacts resulting from the emission of one ton of carbon dioxide in each year. These impacts continue well beyond 2100., 939480=40. See http://www.coppermotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/casestudy_army-truck.pdf., 958836=82. Technical Update of the Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866. Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon, United States Government. May 2013; revised November 2013. http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/inforeg/technical-update-social-cost-of-carbon-for-regulator-impact-analysis.pdf., 126965=A. Review Under Executive Orders 12866 and 13563, 235186=Section 325(o) of EPCA also provides that any new or amended energy conservation standard that DOE prescribes shall be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that DOE determines is economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A)-(B) and 6316(a)). In addition, in determining whether such standard is technologically feasible and economically justified, DOE may not prescribe standards for certain types or classes of electric motors if such standards would not result in significant energy savings. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B) and 6316(a)). For each TSL, DOE projected energy savings from the motors that would be covered under this rulemaking and that would be purchased in the 30-year period that begins in the year of compliance with the new and amended standards (2015-2044). The savings are measured over the entire lifetime of equipment purchased in the 30-year period. [17] DOE quantified the energy savings attributable to each TSL as the difference in energy consumption between each standards case and the base case. The base case represents a projection of energy consumption in the absence of new or amended mandatory efficiency standards, and considers market forces and policies that affect demand for more efficient equipment., 409647=As to DOE's selection of the 75-horsepower representative unit as a maximum, DOE understands that the 75-horsepower motor is not built in the largest NEMA MG 1-2011 frame series covered, but maintains that its selection is appropriate for this analysis. As stated previously, efficiency changes slowly when approaching the highest horsepower ratings, and choosing a higher horsepower rating would not have provided any appreciable improvement over the data DOE already developed for its analysis. DOE has found minimal variation in efficiency for motors above 75-horsepower. Because the change in efficiency diminishes with increasing horsepower, one may achieve a similar level of analytical accuracy with fewer data points at higher horsepower. Stated inversely, one needs more data points to accurately characterize a curve where it has a greater rate of change, such as lower horsepower. Finally, DOE notes that its scaling methodology mirrors the scaling methodology used in NEMA's MG 1-2011 tables of efficiencies, including the rate of change in efficiency with horsepower., 819463=Executive Order 13132, \u201cFederalism.\u201d 64 FR 43255 (Aug. 10, 1999) imposes certain requirements on Federal agencies formulating and implementing policies or regulations that preempt State law or that have Federalism implications. The Executive Order requires agencies to examine the constitutional and statutory authority supporting any action that would limit the policymaking discretion of the States and to carefully assess the necessity for such actions. The Executive Order also requires agencies to have an accountable process to ensure meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have Federalism implications. On March 14, 2000, DOE published a statement of policy describing the intergovernmental consultation process it will follow in the development of such regulations. 65 FR 13735. EPCA governs and prescribes Federal preemption of State regulations as to energy conservation for the equipment that are the subject of today's proposed rule. States can petition DOE for exemption from such preemption to the extent, and based on criteria, set forth in EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 6297) No further action is required by Executive Order 13132., 383154=NEMA also expressed concern that standards based on hand winding would shift U.S. manufacturing jobs to locations outside of the U.S. which have lower labor rates, and Nidec added that most U.S. manufacturers are currently globally positioned to move labor-intensive work into low-cost labor countries if energy conservation requirements force them to do so. (Nidec, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at p. 124) DOE intends to fully capture this impact during the manufacturer impact analysis (MIA) portion of DOE's analysis. Please see section IV.J for a discussion of the manufacturer impact analysis., 54327=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 1, 2015, 334592=NEMA agreed that changing the stack length of an electric motor can improve core losses (i.e. reduce them), but may also change other performance characteristics such as torque, speed and current. However, NEMA stressed that there are limits to this technology option because too much additional stack could cause the motor to increase in size (i.e., frame length), which might introduce utility problems in space-constrained applications (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 62) NEMA also commented that since the EISA 2007 standards were enacted, only a limited number of motor ratings above NEMA Premium have been offered because there is not sufficient space available in most frame ratings to increase the efficiency. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 7) DOE understands that there are limits to increased stack length and, as discussed in IV.C, DOE established criterion to limit the length of the stack considered in the engineering analysis. DOE also understands that stack length affects consumer utility, which is a factor that DOE considers in its selection of a standard., 423182=Currently, there are two energy conservation standard levels that apply to various types of electric motors. In ECG 1, some motors currently must meet efficiency standards that correspond to NEMA MG 1-2011 Table 12-11 (i.e., EPACT 1992 levels [54] ), others must meet efficiency standards that correspond to NEMA MG 1-2011 Table 12-12 (i.e., NEMA Premium levels), and some are not currently required to meet any energy conservation standard levels. Because DOE cannot establish energy conservation standards that are less efficient than current standards (i.e., the \u201canti-backsliding\u201d provision at 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(1) as applied via 42 U.S.C. 6316(a)) but ECG 1 includes both currently regulated and unregulated electric motors, DOE's analysis assumed the respective EPACT 1992 or NEMA Premium standard as the baseline for ELs 1 and 2. For ECG 1, DOE established an EL that corresponded to each of these levels, with EL 0 as the baseline (i.e., the lowest efficiency level available for unregulated motors and EPACT 1992 or NEMA Premium, as applicable, for currently regulated motors), EL 1 as equivalent to EPACT 1992 levels (or NEMA Premium, as applicable, for currently regulated motors), and EL 2 as equivalent to NEMA Premium levels. Additionally, DOE analyzed two ELs above EL 2. One of these levels was the max-tech level, denoted as EL 4 and one was an incremental level that approximated a best-in-market efficiency level (EL 3). For all equipment classes within ECG 1, EL 3 was a one \u201cband\u201d increase in NEMA nominal efficiency relative to NEMA Premium and EL 4 was a two \u201cband\u201d increase. [55] For ECG 3 and 4, DOE used the same ELs with one exception for ECG 3. Because fire pump electric motors are required to meet EPACT 1992 efficiency levels and those are the only motors in that equipment class group, EPACT 1992 levels were used as the baseline efficiency level, which means that fire pump electric motors have one fewer EL than ECGs 1 and 4 for purposes of DOE's analysis. Following the preliminary analysis, DOE adjusted one max-tech Design B representative unit level (5 hp) after receiving additional data. This allowed this unit to be based more on physical models for the NOPR analysis, thereby reducing exposure to modeling errors. Table IV.9 and Table IV.10 show the ELs for ECGs 1, 3, and 4., 602418=The MATS limit mercury emissions from power plants, but they do not include emissions caps and, as such, DOE's energy conservation standards would likely reduce Hg emissions. DOE estimated mercury emissions reduction using emissions factors based on AEO 2013, which incorporates the MATS., 460491=NEMA also commented that to properly determine the impact of increased efficiency on motor utility, DOE must recognize the consequences of how motor performance, including parameters such as acceleration, safe stall time, overspeed, service factor, thermal performance, and in-rush current will be affected by more stringent energy conservation standards. NEMA also specifically referred to performance characteristics found in NEMA MG 1 sections 12.44, 12.45, 12.48, 12.49, 12.53, 12.54, and 12.56. (NEMA, No. 54 at pp. 5, 77) NEMA added that the narrow margin between the NEMA MG 1-2011 limits for locked-rotor current and the calculated locked-rotor current for some of the software-modeled designs in the preliminary analysis suggest that there will be problems with these motors meeting the NEMA MG 1 limits if they were prototyped. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 77) Finally, NEMA indicated that two of the DOE software-modeled motors in the preliminary analysis, representing the 75-horsepower CSLs 4 and 5 for ECG 1, had torque ratings twice that of a U.S. Army 75-horsepower electric motor software model, and suggested that the software models used in DOE's analysis are not accurate in modeling copper rotor motor performance.

The final equipment class setting criterion that DOE had to consider when selecting its representative units was enclosure type. For the preliminary analysis, DOE analyzed only electric motors with totally enclosed, fan-cooled (TEFC) designs rather than open designs for all of its representative units. DOE selected TEFC motors because, as with pole configurations, DOE wanted as many design characteristics to remain constant as possible. DOE believed that such an approach would allow it to more accurately pinpoint the factors that affect efficiency. While DOE only analyzed one enclosure type, it notes that its scaling follows NEMA's efficiency tables (Table 12-11 and Table 12-12), which already map how efficiency changes with enclosure type. Finally, TEFC electric motors represented more than three times the shipment volume of open motors. DOE chose ELs that correspond to the tables of standards published in NEMA's MG 1-2011 and to efficiency bands derived from those tables, preserving the relationship between NEMA's standards for open and enclosed motors., 130242=Title III, Part B of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA or the Act), 94 (42 U.S.C. 6291-6309, as codified), established the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products Other Than Automobiles.

L. 105-277) requires Federal agencies to issue a Family Policymaking Assessment for any rule that may affect family well-being. This proposed rule would not have any impact on the autonomy or integrity of the family as an institution. Accordingly, DOE has concluded that it is not necessary to prepare a Family Policymaking Assessment., 830403=Executive Order 13211, \u201cActions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use\u201d 66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001), requires Federal agencies to prepare and submit to OIRA at OMB, a Statement of Energy Effects for any proposed significant energy action.

DOE recognizes that scaling motor efficiencies is a complicated proposition that has the potential to result in efficiency standards that are not evenly stringent across all equipment classes. However, between DOE's four ECGs, there are 580 combinations of horsepower rating, pole configuration, and enclosure. Within these combinations there are a large number of standardized frame number series. Given the sizable number of frame number series and equipment classes, DOE cannot feasibly analyze all of these variants, hence, the need for scaling. Scaling across horsepower ratings, pole configurations, enclosures, and frame number series is a necessity. For the preliminary analysis, DOE considered two methods to scaling, one that develops a set of power law equations based on the relationships found in the EPACT 1992 and NEMA Premium tables of efficiency in NEMA Standard Publication MG 1, and one based on the incremental improvement of motor losses. As discussed in the preliminary analysis, DOE did not find a large discrepancy between the results of the two approaches and, therefore, used the simpler, incremental improvement of motor losses approach in its NOPR analysis., 540921=To populate the model with current data, DOE used data from a market research report, [73] confidential inputs from manufacturers, trade associations, and other interested parties' responses to the Request for Information (RFI) published in the Federal Register. 76 FR 17577 (March 30, 2011). DOE then used estimates of market distributions to redistribute the shipments across pole configurations, horsepower, and enclosures within each electric motor equipment class and also by sector., 110728=2.

Review Under the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, 599980=Beginning in 2015, however, SO 2 emissions will fall as a result of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for power plants. 77 FR 9304 (Feb. 16, 2012). In the final MATS rule, EPA established a standard for hydrogen chloride as a surrogate for acid gas hazardous air pollutants (HAP), and also established a standard for SO 2 (a non-HAP acid gas) as an alternative equivalent surrogate standard for acid gas HAP. The same controls are used to reduce HAP and non-HAP acid gas; thus, SO 2 emissions will be reduced as a result of the control technologies installed on coal-fired power plants to comply with the MATS requirements for acid gas. AEO 2013 assumes that, in order to continue operating, coal plants must have either flue gas desulfurization or dry sorbent injection systems installed by 2015. Both technologies, which are used to reduce acid gas emissions, also reduce SO 2 emissions. Under the MATS, NEMS shows a reduction in SO 2 emissions when electricity demand decreases (e.g., as a result of energy efficiency standards). Emissions will be far below the cap established by CAIR, so it is unlikely that excess SO 2 emissions allowances resulting from the lower electricity demand would be needed or used to permit offsetting increases in SO 2 emissions by any regulated EGU. Therefore, DOE believes that efficiency standards will reduce SO 2 emissions in 2015 and beyond., 928520=16. The preliminary TSD published in July 2012 is available at: http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EERE-2010-BT-STD-0027-0023., 912041=(k) Starting on December 19, 2015, each integral brake electric motor and non-integral brake electric motor meeting the criteria in paragraph (g) of this section, and with a power rating of 1 horsepower through 30 horsepower, manufactured (alone or as a component of another piece of equipment) shall have a nominal full-load efficiency that is not less than the following:, 237691=DOE has begun to also estimate full-fuel-cycle energy savings. 76 FR 51282 (August 18, 2011), as amended at 77 FR 49701 (August 17, 2012). The full-fuel-cycle (FFC) metric includes the energy consumed in extracting, processing, and transporting primary fuels, and thus presents a more complete picture of the impacts of energy efficiency standards. DOE's evaluation of FFC savings is driven in part by the National Academy of Science's (NAS) report on FFC measurement approaches for DOE's Appliance Standards Program. [18] The NAS report discusses that FFC was primarily intended for energy efficiency standards rulemakings where multiple fuels may be used by a particular product. In the case of this rulemaking pertaining to electric motors, only a single fuel\u2014electricity\u2014is consumed by the equipment. DOE's approach is based on the calculation of an FFC multiplier for each of the energy types used by covered equipment. The methodology for estimating FFC does not project how fuel markets would respond to this particular standard rulemaking. The FFC methodology simply estimates how much additional energy, and in turn how many tons of emissions, may be displaced if the estimated fuel were not consumed by the equipment covered in this rulemaking. It is also important to note that inclusion of FFC savings does not affect DOE's choice of proposed standards., 461787=DOE has carefully considered NEMA's comments in its updated NOPR analysis. As noted, DOE has eliminated designs from its preliminary analysis because of concerns regarding the feasibility of those efficiency levels. Regarding the additional performance parameters, DOE agrees that these characteristics must be maintained when improving an electric motor's efficiency. However, the performance parameters DOE believed to present the largest risk of rendering a motor noncompliant with NEMA MG 1-2011 standards were those related to NEMA design letter, which were adhered to in DOE's modeling efforts. Based on comparisons of motor teardowns and software estimates, DOE has no reason at this time to believe that its modeled designs would violate the additional performance parameters mentioned by NEMA., 941755=46. The parameters DOE believed to present the largest risk of rendering a motor noncompliant with NEMA MG 1-2011 standards were those related to NEMA design letter, which were adhered to in DOE's modeling efforts., 940255=42.

For more information, refer to the Public Participation section near the end of this notice., 173583=The benefits and costs of today's proposed standards for electric motors, sold in years 2015-2044, can also be expressed in terms of annualized values. The annualized monetary values are the sum of (1) the annualized national economic value of the benefits from operation of the commercial and industrial equipment that meet the proposed standards (consisting primarily of operating cost savings from using less energy, minus increases in equipment purchase and installation costs, which is another way of representing consumer NPV), and (2) the annualized monetary value of the benefits of emission reductions, including CO 2 emission reductions. [10], 705639=DOE expects energy conservation standards for electric motors to reduce energy costs for equipment owners, and the resulting net savings to be redirected to other forms of economic activity. Those shifts in spending and economic activity could affect the demand for labor. As described in section IV.N, DOE used an input/output model of the U.S. economy to estimate indirect employment impacts of the TSLs that DOE considered in this rulemaking. DOE understands that there are uncertainties involved in projecting employment impacts, especially changes in the later years of the analysis. Therefore, DOE generated results for near-term time frames (2015-2019), where these uncertainties are reduced., 610280=Economic analyses for Federal regulations have used a wide range of values to estimate the benefits associated with reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In the final model year 2011 CAFE rule, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) used both a \u201cdomestic\u201d SCC value of $2 per metric ton of CO 2 and a \u201cglobal\u201d SCC value of $33 per metric ton of CO 2 for 2007 emission reductions (in 2007$), increasing both values at 2.4 percent per year. DOT also included a sensitivity analysis at $80 per metric ton of CO 2. [79] A 2008 regulation proposed by DOT assumed a domestic SCC value of $7 per metric ton of CO 2 (in 2006$) for 2011 emission reductions (with a range of $0-$14 for sensitivity analysis), also increasing at 2.4 percent per year. [80] A regulation for packaged terminal air conditioners and packaged terminal heat pumps finalized by DOE in October of 2008 used a domestic SCC range of $0 to $20 per metric ton CO 2 for 2007 emission reductions (in 2007$). 73 FR 58772, 58814 (Oct. 7, 2008). In addition, EPA's 2008 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions Under the Clean Air Act identified what it described as \u201cvery preliminary\u201d SCC estimates subject to revision. 73 FR 44354 (July 30, 2008). EPA's global mean values were $68 and $40 per metric ton CO 2 for discount rates of approximately 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively (in 2006$ for 2007 emissions)., 935205=30. The terms \u201cU-frame\u201d and \u201cT-frame\u201d refer to lines of frame size dimensions, with a T-frame motor having a smaller frame size for the same horsepower rating as a comparable U-frame motor. In general, \u201cT\u201d frame became the preferred motor design around 1964 because it provided more horsepower output in a smaller package., 301566=In addition to considering the NEMA design type when establishing equipment class groups, DOE considered whether an electric motor is a fire pump electric motor. EISA 2007 prescribed energy conservation standards for fire pump electric motors (42 U.S.C. 6313(b)(2)(B)) and, subsequently, DOE adopted a definition for the term \u201cfire pump electric motor,\u201d which incorporated portions of National Fire Protection Association Standard (NFPA) 20, \u201cStandard for the Installation of Stationary Pumps for Fire Protection\u201d (2010). Pursuant to NFPA 20, a fire pump electric motor must comply with NEMA Design B performance standards and must continue to run in spite of any risk of damage stemming from overheating or continuous operation. The additional requirements for a fire pump electric motor constitutes a change in utility that DOE believes could also affect its performance and efficiency. Therefore, DOE established a separate equipment class group for such motors in the preliminary analysis to account for the special utility offered by these motors. In its comments, NEMA agreed with DOE's decision to separate fire pump electrical motors as a separate equipment class group. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 20) Consequently, DOE is proposing to continue using a separate equipment class group for fire pump electric motors., 114074=James Raba, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Building Technologies Program, EE-2J, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585-0121. Telephone: (202) 586-8654. Email: Jim.Raba@ee.doe.gov., 205123=As described previously, EISA 2007 constitutes the most recent amendment to EPCA and energy conservation standards for electric motors. Because these amendments required compliance on December 19, 2010, DOE had indicated during the course of public meetings held in advance of today's proposal that motors manufactured after December 19, 2015, would need to comply with any applicable new standards that DOE may set as part of this rulemaking. Today's proposed standards would apply to motors manufactured starting on December 19, 2015. As noted in detail later in this notice, however, DOE is interested in receiving comments on the ability of manufacturers to meet this deadline., 919872=5. Based on U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2013 data., 299895=DOE understands that without established performance standards that form the basis for a two-pole NEMA Design C motor or a NEMA Design C motor with a horsepower rating above 200, motors labeled as such would not meet the proposed regulatory definition for \u201cNEMA Design C motor.\u201d 78 FR 38456 (June 26, 2013). DOE considers motors at these ratings to be improperly labeled if they are name-plated as NEMA Design C. Mislabeled NEMA Design C motors, however, are still subject to energy conservation standards if they meet the definitions and performance standards for a regulated motor\u2014e.g. NEMA Design A or B. And since these motors either need to meet the same efficiency levels or would be required by customers to meet specific performance criteria expected of a given design letter (i.e. Design A, B, or C), DOE does not foresee at this time any incentive that would encourage a manufacturer to identify a Design A or B motor as a Design C motor for standards compliance purposes. DOE understands, however, that NEMA Design C motors as a whole constitute an extremely small percentage of motor shipments\u2014less than two percent of shipments\u2014covered by this rulemaking, which would appear to create an unlikely risk that mislabeling motors as NEMA Design C will be used as an avenue to circumvent standards. Nevertheless, DOE will monitor the potential presence of such motors and may reconsider standards for them provided such practice becomes prevalent., 53659=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 4, 2015, 296464=The primary difference between a NEMA Design A and NEMA Design B electric motor is that they have different locked-rotor current requirements. NEMA Design B motors must not exceed the applicable locked-rotor current level specified in NEMA MG 1-2011, paragraph 12.35.1. NEMA Design A motors, on the other hand, do not have a maximum locked-rotor current limit. In most applications, NEMA Design B motors are generally preferred because locked-rotor current is constrained to established industry standards, making it easier to select suitable motor-starting devices. However, certain applications have special load torque or inertia requirements, which result in a design with high locked-rotor current (NEMA Design A). When selecting starting devices for NEMA Design A motors, extra care must be taken in properly sizing electrical protective devices to avoid nuisance tripping during motor startup. The distinction between NEMA Design A and NEMA Design B motors is important to users who are sensitive to high locked-rotor current; however, both NEMA Design A and Design B motors have identical performance requirements in all other metrics, which indicates that they offer similar levels and types of utility. Given these similarities, DOE is proposing to group these motors together into a single equipment class grouping for the purposes of this rulemaking., 956786=79. See Average Fuel Economy Standards Passenger Cars and Light Trucks Model Year 2011, 74 FR 14196 (March 30, 2009) (Final Rule); Final Environmental Impact Statement Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards, Passenger Cars and Light Trucks, Model Years 2011-2015 at 3-90 (Oct. 2008) (Available at: http://www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy) (Last accessed December 2012)., 534414=Data on motor sales by efficiency are not available. In the preliminary analysis, DOE used the number of models meeting the requirements of each efficiency level from six major manufacturers and one distributor's catalog data to develop the base-case efficiency distributions. The distribution is estimated separately for each equipment class group and horsepower range and was assumed constant and equal to 2012 throughout the analysis period (2015-2044)., 298639=In chapter two, \u201cAnalytical Framework,\u201d of the preliminary technical support document, DOE noted numerous instances where manufacturers were marketing electric motors rated greater than 200 horsepower as NEMA Design C motors. DOE understands that NEMA MG 1-2011 specifies Design C performance requirements for motors rated 1-200 hp in four-, six-, and eight-pole configurations\u2014a motor rated above 200 hp or using a two-pole configuration would not meet the Design C specifications. DOE requested public comment about whether motors that are name-plated as NEMA Design C, but that fall outside the ratings for which NEMA Design C is defined, can be considered to be NEMA Design C motors. In its comments, NEMA asserted it did not support marking a motor as NEMA Design C where no standard exists for two-pole designs, or four-, six- or eight-pole motors over 200 horsepower. NEMA recommended that any such improperly marked motor be examined for determination of its proper Design letter relative to the applicable standards in NEMA MG 1. Furthermore, NEMA recommended that DOE not include efficiency standards for motors of any design type for which NEMA or IEC standards do not exist. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 19), 552376=For each year in the forecast period, DOE calculates the lifetime national energy savings for each standard level by multiplying the shipments of electric motors affected by the energy conservation standards by the per-unit lifetime annual energy savings. Cumulative energy savings are the sum of the NES for all motors shipped during the analysis period, 2015-2044., 259025=As referenced above, on August 15, 2012, the Motor Coalition petitioned DOE to adopt the Coalition's consensus agreement, which, in part, formed the basis for today's proposal. [24] The Motor Coalition petitioned DOE to simplify coverage to address a broad array of electric motors with a few clearly identified exceptions. The Motor Coalition advocated this approach to simplify manufacturer compliance and to help facilitate DOE's enforcement efforts. The Petition highlighted potential energy savings that would result from expanding the scope of covered electric motors. (Motor Coalition, No 35 at pp. 1-30) Subsequent to DOE's preliminary analysis public meeting, several other interested parties submitted comments supporting the Petition. Those supporters included: BBF and Associates, the Air Movement and Control Association International, Inc., U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Bingaman, the Hydraulic Institute, the Arkansas Economic Development and Commission-Energy Office, and the Power Transmission Distributors Association., 303157=In its NOPR analyses, DOE considered whether the term \u201celectric motor\u201d should include an integral brake electric motor or a non-integral brake electric motor (collectively, \u201cbrake motors\u201d). In the test procedure NOPR, DOE proposed definitions both for integral and non-integral brake electric motors. 78 FR 38456 (June 26, 2013). Both of these electric motor types are contained in one equipment class group as separate from the equipment class groups established for NEMA Design A and B motors, NEMA Design C motors, and fire pump electric motors., 782008=Although combining the values of operating savings and CO 2 emission reductions provides a useful perspective, two issues should be considered. First, the national operating savings are domestic U.S. consumer monetary savings that occur as a result of market transactions while the value of CO 2 reductions is based on a global value. Second, the assessments of operating cost savings and CO 2 savings are performed with different methods that use different time frames for analysis. The national operating cost savings is measured for the lifetime of electric motors shipped in 2015 -2044. The SCC values, on the other hand, reflect the present value of some future climate-related impacts resulting from the emission of one ton of carbon dioxide in each year. These impacts continue well beyond 2100., 919033=2. Table 20-B of MG1-2011 provides nominal full-load efficiencies for ratings without nominal full-load efficiencies in Table 12-12 of MG1-2011., 211626=During the course of preparing for the electric motors energy conservation standards rulemaking, information was submitted to DOE by NEMA, ASAP, and CDA in response to DOE's RFI and then later in the Petition from the Motors Coalition [14] that caused DOE to reevaluate the scope of electric motors it was considering in this rulemaking. That Petition, and related supporting information, suggested that DOE apply the NEMA Premium efficiency levels (\u201cNEMA Premium\u201d) to a much broader swath of electric motors than are currently regulated by DOE, rather than increase the stringency of the standards that had only recently come into effect (i.e., EISA 2007 standards). As part of its routine practice, DOE reviewed the information and the merits of the Petition. With the potential prospect of expanding the types of motors that would be regulated by standards, DOE recognized the need to amend its test procedures to add the necessary testing preparatory steps (i.e. test set-up procedures) to DOE's regulations. The inclusion of these steps would help ensure that manufacturers of these new motor types would be performing the same steps as are performed when testing currently regulated motors., 472636=Based on these comments, DOE has slightly modified its approach. First, DOE added updated data for 2012 pricing. Second, rather than a five-year average, DOE changed to a three-year average price for copper materials. DOE made this modification based on feedback received during manufacturer interviews. By reducing to a three-year average, DOE eliminated data from 2008 and 2009, which manufacturers believed were unrepresentative data points due to the recession. Data from those two years had the effect of depressing the five-year average calculated., 924762=15. EPCA specifies the types of industrial equipment that can be classified as covered in addition to the equipment enumerated in 42 U.S.C. 6311(1). This equipment includes \u201cother motors\u201d (to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 6311(2)(B)). Industrial equipment must also, without regard to whether such equipment is in fact distributed in commerce for industrial or commercial use, be of a type that: (1) In operation consumes, or is designed to consume, energy in operation; (2) to any significant extent, is distributed in commerce for industrial or commercial use; and (3) is not a covered product as defined in 42 U.S.C. 6291(a)(2) of EPCA, other than a component of a covered product with respect to which there is in effect a determination under 42 U.S.C. 6312(c). (42 U.S.C. 6311 (2)(A)). Data from the 2002 United States Industrial Electric Motor Systems Market Opportunities Assessment estimated total energy use from industrial motor systems to be 747 billion kWh. Based on the expansion of industrial activity, it is likely that current annual electric motor energy use is higher than this figure. Electric motors are distributed in commerce for both the industrial and commercial sectors. According to data provided by the Motor Coalition, the number of electric motors manufactured in, or imported into, the United States is over five million electric motors annually, including special and definite purpose motors. Finally, special and definite purpose motors are not currently regulated under Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 430 (10 CFR part 430)., 368113=NEMA commented that DOE failed to address the adverse impacts on equipment utility or availability caused by die-cast copper rotors. It asserted that the process for manufacturing die-cast copper rotors is underdeveloped, and energy conservation standards based on this technology, and implemented in 2015, would result in product unavailability of over 99 percent of the electric motors that would be impacted if DOE were to set a standard that would require the use of die-cast copper. NEMA reiterated that there is no justification as to how motors that are not available today, made from a technology that is not practiced in the U.S. today, will become available within three years, especially when taking into account the time needed for prototyping, testing, and AEDM certification. (NEMA, No. 54 at pp. 3, 47, 48, 54, 55, 56; NEMA, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at pp. 114, 115), 596547=DOE conducted the emissions analysis using emissions factors that were derived from data in the Energy Information Agency's (EIA's) Annual Energy Outlook 2013 (AEO 2013), supplemented by data from other sources. DOE developed separate emissions factors for power sector emissions and upstream emissions. The method that DOE used to derive emissions factors is described in chapter 13 of the NOPR TSD., 597033=EIA prepares the Annual Energy Outlook using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS). Each annual version of NEMS incorporates the projected impacts of existing air quality regulations on emissions. AEO 2013 generally represents current legislation and environmental regulations, including recent government actions, for which implementing regulations were available as of December 31, 2012., 597513=SO 2 emissions from affected electric generating units (EGUs) are subject to nationwide and regional emissions cap-and-trade programs. Title IV of the Clean Air Act sets an annual emissions cap on SO 2 for affected EGUs in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia (DC). SO 2 emissions from 28 eastern states and DC were also limited under the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR; 70 FR 25162 (May 12, 2005)), which created an allowance-based trading program that operates along with the Title IV program. CAIR was remanded to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit but it remained in effect. See North Carolina v. EPA, 550 F.3d 1176 (D.C. Cir. 2008); North Carolina v. EPA, 531 F.3d 896 (D.C. Cir. 2008). On July 6, 2011 EPA issued a replacement for CAIR, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). 76 FR 48208 (August 8, 2011). On August 21, 2012, the DC Circuit issued a decision to vacate CSAPR. See EME Homer City Generation, LP v. EPA, No. 11-1302, 2012 WL 3570721 at *24 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 21, 2012). The court ordered EPA to continue administering CAIR. The AEO 2013 emissions factors used for today's NOPR assumes that CAIR remains a binding regulation through 2040., 223545=DOE has the authority to set energy conservation standards for a wider range of electric motors than those classified as general purpose electric motors (e.g., definite or special purpose motors). EPACT 1992 amended EPCA to include, among other things, a definition for the term \u201celectric motor\u201d\u2014which the statute defined as including certain \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d motors. (42 U.S.C. 6311(13)(A) (1992)) The amendments also defined the terms \u201cdefinite purpose motors\u201d and \u201cspecial purpose motor.\u201d (42 U.S.C. 6311(13)(C) and (D)) (1992)) EPACT 1992 initially prescribed energy conservation standards for \u201celectric motors\u201d (i.e., subtype I general purpose electric motors) and explicitly stated that these standards did not apply to definite purpose or special purpose motors. (42 U.S.C. 6313(b)(1) (1992)) However, EISA 2007 struck the narrow EPACT 1992 definition of \u201celectric motor.\u201d With the removal of this definition, the term \u201celectric motor\u201d became broader in scope. As a result of these changes, both definite and special purpose motors fell under the broad heading of \u201celectric motors\u201d that previously only applied to \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d motors. While EISA 2007 prescribed standards for general purpose motors, the Act did not apply those standards to definite or special purpose motors. (42 U.S.C. 6313(b) (2012)), 397876=For ECG 3, which consists of fire pump electric motors, DOE based its engineering analysis on the NEMA Design B units analyzed for ECG 1 in the preliminary analysis. As noted, in order to be in compliance with section 9.5 of National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) \u201cStandard for the Installation of Stationary Pumps for Fire Protection\u201d Standard 20-2010, which is a requirement for a motor to meet DOE's current definition of a fire pump electric motor, the motor must comply with NEMA Design B (or IEC Design N) requirements. [51] Although DOE understands that fire pump electric motors have additional performance requirements, DOE believed that analysis of the ECG 1 motors would serve as a sufficient approximation for the cost-efficiency relationship for fire pump electric motors. The design differences between a NEMA Design B motor (or IEC-equivalent) and fire pump electric motor are small and unlikely to greatly affect incremental cost behavior., 167562=The estimated cumulative net present value (NPV) of total consumer costs and savings attributed to the proposed standards for electric motors ranges from $8.7 billion (at a 7-percent discount rate) to $23.3 billion (at a 3-percent discount rate). This NPV expresses the estimated total value of future operating-cost savings minus the estimated increased equipment costs for equipment purchased in 2015-2044., 560678=DOE uses the GRIM to quantify the changes in cash flow over time due to a standard. These changes in cash flow result in either a higher or lower INPV for the standards case compared to the base case, the case where a standard is not set. The GRIM analysis uses a standard annual cash flow analysis that incorporates manufacturer costs, markups, shipments, and industry financial information as inputs. It then models changes in costs, investments, and manufacturer margins that result from new and amended energy conservation standards. The GRIM spreadsheet uses the inputs to calculate a series of annual cash flows beginning with the base year of the analysis, 2013, and continuing to 2044. DOE computes INPVs by summing the stream of annual discounted cash flows during this analysis period. DOE used a real discount rate of 9.1 percent for electric motor manufacturers. The discount rate estimates were derived from industry corporate annual reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC 10-Ks) and then modified according to feedback during manufacturer interviews. Many inputs into the GRIM come from the engineering analysis, the NIA, manufacturer interviews, and other research conducted during the MIA. The major GRIM inputs are described in detail in the sections below., 356582=NEMA summarized that it is not aware of any prototypes or commercially available products that have demonstrated the technical feasibility of utilizing die-cast copper rotors sufficient to cover all equipment classes covered in this rulemaking. NEMA disagreed with DOE's conclusion that die-cast copper rotors successfully passed the screening criteria for technological feasibility relative to the class of all covered electric motors, including the 75-hp copper rotor motor which DOE used as a representative unit in the engineering analysis. NEMA added that DOE has not provided any evidence that die-casting copper can successfully be applied to all electric motors covered in this rulemaking by December 19, 2015. NEMA added that the recent studies conducted by the United States Army noted above showed that, in the U.S. at present or in any foreseeable future time, this technology is not currently feasible over the range of motor ratings regulated under this rulemaking. (NEMA, No. 54 at pp. 3, 53, 56; NEMA, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at p. 111), 411967=In submitted comments, NEMA expressed confusion over DOE's selection of the 50-horsepower representative unit for the NEMA Design C equipment class group. NEMA stated that the NEMA T-frame size for such a rating is 326T, which is three NEMA T-frame number series below the largest frame number series of 440. NEMA requested that DOE clarify why it limited its NEMA Design C representative unit to such a low value in its engineering analysis. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 66) Finally, NEMA commented that the 2011 shipment data that DOE used to select its representative units was not broken down by NEMA design type. NEMA believed that using such data to select representative units for ECGs 1 and 2 was not appropriate and requested clarification. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 66), 451293=During the preliminary analysis public meeting, Nidec requested clarification for the increase in stator copper weight for the 75-horsepower, ECG 1 representative unit between CSL 2 and CSL 3 since the reported slot fills were the same and the motors had similar stack lengths. (Nidec, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at pp. 164, 165) After DOE's tear-down lab determined that the torn-down motors were machine-wound a precise measurement of the slot fill was not taken. Although the actual measurement of slot fill has no bearing on the estimates of the MSP, because the actual copper weights were measured and not calculated, DOE did ask its lab to provide actual measurements of slot fill on any subsequent tear-downs and has included the data in chapter 5 of the TSD., 77869=6 actions from September 28th, 2010 to May 2014, 537252=Any amended standard for electric motors shall apply to electric motors manufactured on or after a date which is five years after the effective date of the previous amendment. (42 U.S.C. 6313(b)(4)) In this case, the effective date of the previous amendment (established by EISA in 2007) is December 19, 2010, and the compliance date of any amended energy conservation standards for electric motors would be December 19, 2015. In light of the proposal's attempt to establish amended or new standards for currently regulated and unregulated electric motor types, DOE has chosen to retain the same compliance date for both the amended and new energy conservation standards to simplify the requirements and to avoid any potential confusion from manufacturers. The final rule for this rulemaking is scheduled to be published in early 2014. DOE calculated the LCC and PBP for all end-users as if each would purchase a new piece of equipment in the year that compliance is required. As DOE notes elsewhere, DOE is interested in comments regarding the feasibility of achieving compliance with this proposed date., 202270=On October 5, 1999, DOE published in the Federal Register, a final rule to implement the EPACT 1992 electric motor requirements. 64 FR 54114. In response to EISA 2007, on March 23, 2009, DOE updated, among other things, the corresponding electric motor regulations at 10 CFR part 431 with the new definitions and energy conservation standards. 74 FR 12058. On December 22, 2008, DOE proposed to update the test procedures under 10 CFR part 431 both for electric motors and small electric motors. 73 FR 78220. DOE finalized key provisions related to small electric motor testing in a 2009 final rule at 74 FR 32059 (July 7, 2009), and further updated the test procedures for electric motors and small electric motors at 77 FR 26608 (May 4, 2012). The May 2012 final rule primarily focused on updating various definitions and incorporations by reference related to the current test procedure. In that rule, DOE promulgated a regulatory definition of \u201celectric motor\u201d to account for EISA 2007's removal of the previous statutory definition of \u201celectric motor.\u201d DOE also clarified definitions related to those motors that EISA 2007 laid out as part of EPCA's statutory framework, including motor types that DOE had not previously regulated. See generally, id. at 26613-26619. DOE published a new proposed test procedure rulemaking on June 26, 2013, that proposes to further refine some existing electric motor definitions and add certain definitions and test procedure preparatory steps to address a wider variety of electric motor types than are currently regulated. 78 FR 38456., 53719=On June 2, 2015, the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) hosted its 3rd Annual Federal Register Liaison Conference in the National Archives\u2019 McGowan Theater. What exactly is a Federal... Continue reading \u2192, 64301=This document was corrected by a document published on 02/14/2014. View Correction, 473313=In the preliminary analysis, DOE looked at the percentage of electric motors imported into the U.S. and the percentage of electric motors built domestically and based the balance of foreign and domestic labor rates on these percentages. During the preliminary analysis public meeting, Nidec commented that the labor rate DOE used in its analysis seems high if that number is weighted towards offshore labor. Nidec also agreed with DOE's smaller markup on the lower-horsepower motors, but commented that the overall markups DOE used seem to be high. (Nidec, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at p. 184) WEG added to these comments, indicating that they believed DOE was adequately addressing the cost structure variations among the different motor manufacturers. Additionally, WEG believed that basing a labor rate on both foreign and domestic labor rates increases accuracy of the analysis, but warned that DOE should be careful not encourage production moving outside the United States. (WEG, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at pp. 184-186), 253725=EISA 2007 amended EPCA to prescribe energy conservation standards for four categories of electric motors: General purpose electric motors (subtype I) (hereinafter, \u201csubtype I\u201d), general purpose electric motors (subtype II) (hereinafter, \u201csubtype II\u201d), fire pump electric motors, and NEMA Design B, general purpose electric motors that also meet the subtype I or subtype II definitions and are rated above 200 horsepower through 500 horsepower. DOE's most recent test procedure final rule added clarity to the definitions for each of these motor categories, which are now codified at 10 CFR 431.12. 77 FR 26608., 843756=Confidential Business Information. According to 10 CFR 1004.11, any person submitting information that he or she believes to be confidential and exempt by law from public disclosure should submit via email, postal mail, or hand delivery/courier two well-marked copies: One copy of the document marked confidential including all the information believed to be confidential, and one copy of the document marked non-confidential with the information believed to be confidential deleted. Submit these documents via email or on a CD, if feasible. DOE will make its own determination about the confidential status of the information and treat it according to its determination., 920908=8. Technical Update of the Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866. Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon, United States Government. May 2013; revised November 2013. http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/inforeg/technical-update-social-cost-of-carbon-for-regulator-impact-analysis.pdf., 207252=Then, on August 15, 2012, a group of interested parties (the \u201cMotor Coalition\u201d [12] ) submitted a Petition to DOE asking the agency to adopt a consensus stakeholder proposal that would amend the energy conservation standards for electric motors. The Motor Coalition's proposal advocated expanding the scope of coverage to a broader range of motors than what DOE currently regulates and it recommended that energy conservation standards for all covered electric motors be set at levels that are largely equivalent to what DOE proposes in today's NOPR (i.e., efficiency levels in NEMA MG1-2011 Tables 12-12 and 20-B). [13], 458514=NEMA commented that the preliminary TSD did not show that the software platform DOE used had been substantiated as being sufficiently accurate for motors incorporating existing and new technologies. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 12) NEMA asserted that it is necessary to substantiate the software platform used for modeling as an alternate efficiency determination method (AEDM) such that the calculated efficiencies can be verified as accurate for the types of technologies included in a motor design. NEMA urged that DOE substantiate the software platform used by its SME as an AEDM. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 76) Baldor added that DOE expects manufacturers to prototype five motors to certify a program, but DOE has not designed and built any of the motors designed in its own program. (Baldor, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at p. 162) Nidec commented during the public meeting, asking if the software modeling suite DOE used has gone through the same scrutiny that manufacturers are subject to when they must submit their 25 samples to correlate their estimated computer data with actual testing data. (Nidec, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 60 at p. 147), 929589=18. \u201cReview of Site (Point-of-Use) and Full-Fuel-Cycle Measurement Approaches to DOE/EERE Building ApplianceEnergy-Efficiency Standards,\u201d (Academy report) was completed in May 2009 and included five recommendations. A copy of the study can be downloaded at: http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12670., 499654=As discussed in IV.C.3, some of the ELs analyzed by DOE were based on existing efficiency standards (i.e., EPACT 1992 and NEMA Premium). Additionally, the baseline EL is based on the lowest efficiency levels found for each horsepower rating, pole configuration, and enclosure type observed in motor catalog data. Therefore, DOE only required the use of scaling when developing the two ELs above NEMA Premium (only one EL above NEMA Premium for ECG 2)., 276020=After considering these comments, and further analyzing available relevant information, DOE believes that a simplified approach to determining coverage would help ensure consistency to the extent possible when applying the proposed standards. Therefore, in today's notice, DOE is proposing that an electric motor that meets the nine characteristics in Table IV-3 would be covered and required to meet the applicable energy conservation standards, either in NEMA MG 1 Table 12-11 or 12-12. Additionally, DOE is proposing not to set standards at this time for the following motors: component sets, liquid-cooled motors, submersible motors, and definite-purpose inverter-fed motors. DOE is not proposing to set standards for these motors in light of the substantial difficulties and complexities that would be involved in testing these motors at this time. In addition, DOE is proposing not to set standards at this time for air-over motors, but intends to address these types of motors in a separate rulemaking. Definitions for the motor types and additional details about these issues are addressed at 78 FR 38456 (June 26, 2013)., 959595=83. For additional information, refer to U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 2006 Report to Congress on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulations and Unfunded Mandates on State, Local, and Tribal Entities, Washington, DC., 131996=In accordance with these and other statutory provisions discussed in this notice, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposes amending the energy conservation standards for electric motors by applying the standards currently in place to a wider scope of electric motors for which DOE does not currently regulate. In setting these standards, DOE is proposing to address a number of different groups of electric motors that have, to date, not been required to satisfy the energy conservation standards currently set out in 10 CFR part 431. In addition, with the exception of fire pump electric motors, the proposal would require all currently regulated motors to satisfy the efficiency levels prescribed in Table 12-12 and Table 20-B2 of MG1-2011, published by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association; fire pump motors would continue to meet the current standards that apply. All other electric motors that DOE is proposing to regulate would also need to meet these efficiency levels (i.e. Tables 12-12 and 20-B). As a practical matter, the many currently regulated motors would continue to be required to meet the standards that they already meet, but certain motors, such as those that satisfy the general purpose electric motors (subtype II) (\u201csubtype II\u201d) or that are NEMA Design B motors from 201 through 500 horsepower, would need to meet the more stringent levels prescribed by MG1-2011 Tables 12-12 and 20-B. These proposed efficiency levels are shown in Table I.1. If adopted, the proposed standards would apply to all covered motor types listed in Table I.1 that are manufactured in, or imported into, the United States starting on December 19, 2015. DOE may, however, depending on the nature of the comments it receives, revisit this proposed compliance date., 433413=DOE clarifies that the vertical hollow-shaft motors purchased and used to determine the baseline efficiency level for ECG 1 contained bearings capable of horizontal operation. Therefore, DOE tested these motors in a horizontal configuration without any modifications to the bearings. Additionally, when tested, solid-shafts were welded inside the hollow-shaft to permit the motor to be attached to a dynamometer for testing. These modifications are in line with the proposals for vertical hollow shaft motors as described in DOE's electric motors test procedure NOPR. 78 FR 38456 (June 26, 2013)., 818292=Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, DOE has determined that the proposed rule fits within the category of actions included in Categorical Exclusion (CX) B5.1 and otherwise meets the requirements for application of a CX. See 10 CFR Part 1021, App. B, B5.1(b); 1021.410(b) and Appendix B, B(1)-(5). The proposed rule fits within the category of actions because it is a rulemaking that establishes energy conservation standards for consumer products or industrial equipment, and for which none of the exceptions identified in CX B5.1(b) apply. Therefore, DOE has made a CX determination for this rulemaking, and DOE does not need to prepare an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement for this proposed rule. DOE's CX determination for this proposed rule is available at http://cxnepa.energy.gov/., 114455=Ms. Ami Grace-Tardy, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of the General Counsel, GC-71, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585-0121. Telephone: (202) 586-5709. Email: Ami.Grace-Tardy@hq.doe.gov., 185150=Title III, Part B of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA or the Act), 94, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6291-6309) established the \u201cEnergy Conservation Program for Consumer Products Other Than Automobiles.\u201d Part C of Title III of EPCA (42 U.S.C. 6311-6317) established a similar program for \u201cCertain Industrial Equipment,\u201d including electric motors. [11] The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) (102) amended EPCA by establishing energy conservation standards and test procedures for certain commercial and industrial electric motors (in context, \u201cmotors\u201d) manufactured (alone or as a component of another piece of equipment) after October 24, 1997. In December 2007, Congress passed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007) (Pub. L. 110-140). Section 313(b)(1) of EISA 2007 updated the energy conservation standards for those electric motors already covered by EPCA and established energy conservation standards for a larger scope of motors not previously covered by standards. (42 U.S.C. 6313(b)(2)) EPCA directs the Secretary of Energy to publish a final rule no later than 24 months after the effective date of the previous final rule to determine whether to amend the standards already in effect. Any such amendment shall apply to electric motors manufactured after a date which is five years after either: (1) The effective date of the previous amendment or (2) if the previous final rule did not amend the standards, the earliest date by which a previous amendment could have been effective. (42 U.S.C. 6313(b)(4)(B)), 536676=As mentioned previously, DOE developed the 2012 base case efficiency distributions based on catalog information on the number of models meeting the requirements of each efficiency level. For the NOPR, DOE retained the same methodology and revised the catalog information to account for the addition of brake motors and NEMA 56-frame size enclosed electric motors in the analysis. DOE has no data to assess the stakeholders' input on the base case efficiency distributions., 708183=Enhanced energy efficiency, where economically justified, improves the Nation's energy security, strengthens the economy, and reduces the environmental impacts or costs of energy production. Reduced electricity demand due to energy conservation standards is also likely to reduce the cost of maintaining the reliability of the electricity system, particularly during peak-load periods. As a measure of this reduced demand, chapter 15 in the NOPR TSD presents the estimated reduction in generating capacity in 2044 for the TSLs that DOE considered in this rulemaking., 864789=(b) Each fire pump electric motor that is a general purpose electric motor (subtype I) or general purpose electric motor (subtype II) manufactured (alone or as a component of another piece of equipment) on or after December 19, 2010, but before December 19, 2015, shall have a nominal full-load efficiency that is not less than the following:, 954689=76. IMS Research (February 2012), The World Market for Low Voltage Motors, 2012 Edition, Austin; Business Trend Analysts, The Motor and Generator Industry, 2002; U.S. Census Bureau (November 2004), Motors and Generators\u20142003.MA335H(03)-1. http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/cir/historical_data/discontinued/ma335h/index.html; and U.S. Census Bureau (August 2003), Motors and Generators\u20142002.MA335H(02)-1. http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/cir/historical_data/discontinued/ma335h/ma335h02.xls., 687651=Several manufacturers expressed concern about the compliance date of this rulemaking to the proximity of the 2015 compliance date for the small electric motors rulemaking at 75 FR 10874 (March 9, 2010). Most manufacturers of electric motors covered by this rulemaking also produce electric motors that are covered by the small electric motors rulemaking. Manufacturers stated that adopting these two regulations in a potentially short timeframe could strain R and capital expenditure budgets for motor manufacturers. Some manufacturers also raised concerns about other existing regulations separate from DOE's energy conservation standards that electric motors must meet: the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 70, National Electric Code; the NFPA 20, Standard for the Installation of Stationary Pumps for Fire Protection; and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations. DOE discusses these and other requirements in chapter 12 of the NOPR TSD. DOE takes into account the cost of compliance with other published Federal energy conservation standards in weighing the benefits and burdens of today's proposed rulemaking. In the 2010 small motors final rule, DOE estimated that manufacturers may lose up to 11.3 percent of their INPV, which was approximately $39.5 million, in 2009$. To see the range of impacts DOE estimated for the small motors rule, see chapter 12 of the NOPR TSD. DOE does not describe the quantitative impacts of standards that have not yet been finalized because any impacts would be highly speculative. DOE also notes that certain standards are optional for manufacturers and takes that into account when creating the cumulative regulatory burden analysis., 595527=In the emissions analysis, DOE estimated the reduction in power sector emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrogen oxides (NO X), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and mercury (Hg) from potential energy conservation standards for electric motors. In addition, DOE estimates emissions impacts in production activities (extracting, processing, and transporting fuels) that provide the energy inputs to power plants. These are referred to as \u201cupstream\u201d emissions. Together, these emissions account for the full-fuel-cycle (FFC). In accordance with DOE's FFC Statement of Policy (76 FR 51282 (August 18, 2011) as amended at 77 FR 49701 (August 17, 2012)), the FFC analysis includes impacts on emissions of methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O, both of which are recognized as greenhouse gases., 582394=SEW-Eurodrive expressed concern about establishing energy conservation standards for integral gearmotors. SEW-Eurodrive stated that manufacturers would have to review and ensure the compatibility between the motor and the gearbox for all new integral gearmotor designs. Setting standards for these motors, in its view, may cause manufacturers to review potentially millions of motor-gear box combinations. SEW-Eurodrive also stated that since integral gearmotors comprise a system whose overall efficiency is limited by the low efficiency of the mating gearing, an increase in the efficiency of the motor alone would have a very small effect on the overall system efficiency. (SEW-Eurodrive, No. 53 at p. 3) DOE believes that these integral gearmotors can be tested by removing the gearbox and simply testing the partial motor in accordance with the partial motor test procedure proposed at 78 FR 38455 (June 26, 2013). This approach would allow integral gearmotor motor manufacturers to test and certify the electric motors and not every combination of electric motor and gearbox., 113476=For further information on how to submit a comment, review other public comments and the docket, or participate in the public meeting, contact Ms. Brenda Edwards at (202) 586-2945 or by email: Brenda.Edwards@ee.doe.gov., 542687=For the preliminary analysis, DOE collected data on historical series of shipment quantities and value for the 1990-2003 period, but concluded that the data were not sufficient to estimate motor price elasticity. [75] Consequently, DOE assumed zero price elasticity for all efficiency standards cases and did not estimate any impact of potential standards levels on shipments. DOE requested stakeholder recommendations on data sources to help better estimate the impacts of increased efficiency levels on shipments., 794296=DOE has also reviewed this regulation pursuant to Executive Order 13563, issued on January 18, 2011 (76 FR 3281, Jan. 21, 2011). EO 13563 is supplemental to and explicitly reaffirms the principles, structures, and definitions governing regulatory review established in Executive Order 12866. To the extent permitted by law, agencies are required by Executive Order 13563 to: (1) Propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that its benefits justify its costs (recognizing that some benefits and costs are difficult to quantify); (2) tailor regulations to impose the least burden on society, consistent with obtaining regulatory objectives, taking into account, among other things, and to the extent practicable, the costs of cumulative regulations; (3) select, in choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, those approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity); (4) to the extent feasible, specify performance objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or manner of compliance that regulated entities must adopt; and (5) identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation, including providing economic incentives to encourage the desired behavior, such as user fees or marketable permits, or providing information upon which choices can be made by the public., 612093=In 2009, an interagency process was initiated to offer a preliminary assessment of how best to quantify the benefits from reducing carbon dioxide emissions. To ensure consistency in how benefits are evaluated across agencies, the Administration sought to develop a transparent and defensible method, specifically designed for the rulemaking process, to quantify avoided climate change damages from reduced CO 2 emissions. The interagency group did not undertake any original analysis. Instead, it combined SCC estimates from the existing literature to use as interim values until a more comprehensive analysis could be conducted. The outcome of the preliminary assessment by the interagency group was a set of five interim values: Global SCC estimates for 2007 (in 2006$) of $55, $33, $19, $10, and $5 per metric ton of CO 2. These interim values represented the first sustained interagency effort within the U.S. government to develop an SCC for use in regulatory analysis. The results of this preliminary effort were presented in several proposed and final rules., 200895=EPACT 1992 amended EPCA by establishing energy conservation standards and test procedures for certain commercial and industrial electric motors manufactured either alone or as a component of another piece of equipment after October 24, 1997. Section 313 of EISA 2007 amended EPCA by: (1) Striking the definition of \u201celectric motor\u201d provided under EPACT 1992, (2) setting forth definitions for \u201cgeneral purpose electric motor (subtype I)\u201d and \u201cgeneral purpose electric motor (subtype II),\u201d and (3) prescribing energy conservation standards for \u201cgeneral purpose electric motors (subtype I),\u201d \u201cgeneral purpose electric motors (subtype II), \u201cfire pump electric motors,\u201d and \u201cNEMA Design B general purpose electric motors\u201d with a power rating of more than 200 horsepower but not greater than 500 horsepower. (42 U.S.C. 6311(13), 6313(b)). The current standards for these motors, which are reproduced in the proposed regulatory text at the end of this notice, are divided into four tables that prescribe specific efficiency levels for each of those groups of motors., 541588=DOE's shipments projection assumes that electric motor sales are driven by machinery production growth for equipment including motors. DOE estimated that growth rates for total motor shipments correlate to growth rates in fixed investment in equipment and structures including motors, which is provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). [74] Projections of real gross domestic product (GDP) from AEO 2013 for 2015-2040 were used to project fixed investments in the equipment and structures including motors. The current market distributions are maintained over the forecast period., 554657=As noted in section IV.F.2, DOE assumed no change in electric motor prices over the 2015-2044 period. In addition, DOE conducted a sensitivity analysis using alternative price trends. DOE developed one forecast in which prices decline after 2011, and one in which prices rise. These price trends, and the NPV results from the associated sensitivity cases, are described in appendix 10-B of the NOPR TSD., 951840=70. U.S. Department of Energy Information Administration (2003), Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2003/pdf/a4.pdf., 834470=The time, date, and location of the public meeting are listed in the DATES and ADDRESSES sections at the beginning of this notice. If you plan to attend the public meeting, please notify Ms. Brenda Edwards at (202) 586-2945 or Brenda.Edwards@ee.doe.gov. As explained in the ADDRESSES section, foreign nationals visiting DOE Headquarters are subject to advance security screening procedures., 614898=In 2010, the interagency group selected four sets of SCC values for use in regulatory analyses. [81] Three sets of values are based on the average SCC from three integrated assessment models, at discount rates of 2.5 percent, 3 percent, and 5 percent. The fourth set, which represents the 95th-percentile SCC estimate across all three models at a 3-percent discount rate, is included to represent higher-than-expected impacts from climate change further out in the tails of the SCC distribution. The values grow in real terms over time. Additionally, the interagency group determined that a range of values from 7 percent to 23 percent should be used to adjust the global SCC to calculate domestic effects, although preference is given to consideration of the global benefits of reducing CO 2 emissions. Table IV.26 presents the values in the 2010 interagency group report, which is reproduced in appendix 14-A of the NOPR TSD., 230052=However, motor types that exhibit all of the characteristics listed above, but that DOE does not believe should be subject to energy conservation standards at this time because of the current absence of a reliable and repeatable method to test them for efficiency, would be listed as motors that would not at this time be subject to energy conservation standards. Once a test procedure becomes available, DOE may consider setting standards for these motors at that time. See generally, 78 FR 38456 (June 26, 2013). DOE requests comment on these nine characteristics and their appropriateness for outlining scope of coverage., 694090=Circular A-4 requires agencies to present analytical results, including separate schedules of the monetized benefits and costs that show the type and timing of benefits and costs. Circular A-4 also directs agencies to consider the variability of key elements underlying the estimates of benefits and costs. For this rulemaking, DOE undertook a sensitivity analysis using nine rather than 30 years of equipment shipments. The choice of a nine-year period is a proxy for the timeline in EPCA for the review of certain energy conservation standards and potential revision of and compliance with such revised standards. [87] We would note that the review timeframe established in EPCA generally does not overlap with the equipment lifetime, equipment manufacturing cycles or other factors specific to electric motors. Thus, this information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of any change in DOE's analytical methodology. The NES results based on a 9-year analytical period are presented in Table V.15. The impacts are counted over the lifetime of electric motors purchased in 2015-2023., 518837=To forecast a price trend for the preliminary analysis, DOE derived an inflation-adjusted index of the producer price index (PPI) for integral horsepower motors and generators manufacturing from 1969 to 2011. These data show a long-term decline from 1985 to 2003, and then a steep increase since then. DOE also examined a forecast based on the \u201cchained price index\u2014industrial equipment\u201d that was forecasted for AEO2012 out to 2040. This index is the most disaggregated category that includes electric motors. These data show a short-term increase from 2011 to 2015, and then a steep decrease since then. DOE believes that there is considerable uncertainty as to whether the recent trend has peaked, and would be followed by a return to the previous long-term declining trend, or whether the recent trend represents the beginning of a long-term rising trend due to global demand for electric motors and rising commodity costs for key motor components. Given the uncertainty, DOE chose to use constant prices (2010 levels) for both its LCC and PBP analysis and the NIA. For the NIA, DOE also analyzed the sensitivity of results to alternative electric motor price forecasts., 553169=DOE has historically presented NES in terms of primary energy savings. In response to the recommendations of a committee on \u201cPoint-of-Use and Full-Fuel-Cycle Measurement Approaches to Energy Efficiency Standards\u201d appointed by the National Academy of Science, DOE announced its intention to use full-fuel-cycle (FFC) measures of energy use and greenhouse gas and other emissions in the national impact analyses and emissions analyses included in future energy conservation standards rulemakings. 76 FR 51281 (August 18, 2011). While DOE stated in that notice that it intended to use the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model to conduct the analysis, it also said it would review alternative methods, including the use of EIA's National Energy Modeling System (NEMS). After evaluating both models and the approaches discussed in the August 18, 2011 notice, DOE published a statement of amended policy in the Federal Register in which DOE explained its determination that NEMS is a more appropriate tool for this specific use. 77 FR 49701 (August 17, 2012). Therefore, DOE is using NEMS to conduct FFC analyses. The approach used for today's NOPR, and the FFC multipliers that were applied, are described in appendix 10-C of the TSD., 618692=The SCC values used for today's notice were generated using the most recent versions of the three integrated assessment models that have been published in the peer-reviewed literature. [82] Table IV.27shows the updated sets of SCC estimates from the 2013 interagency update in five-year increments from 2010 to 2050. Appendix 14A of the NOPR TSD provides the full set of values. The central value that emerges is the average SCC across models at 3-percent discount rate. However, for purposes of capturing the uncertainties involved in regulatory impact analysis, the interagency group emphasizes the importance of including all four sets of SCC values., 348773=NEMA commented that performance is a relative term, and that the NEMA MG 1-2011 standard specifies performance characteristics and specifications for various types of motors. NEMA added that tradeoffs among various performance characteristics related to the conductivity of copper are required when designing a NEMA Design B electric motor that is in full conformance with the NEMA MG 1-2011 standards. NEMA commented that DOE did not address all aspects of motor performance specified in the NEMA MG 1-2011 standard, especially some of the performance requirements related to the choice of conductive material in the rotor. (NEMA, No. 54 at p. 46), 807669=At TSL 2, the level proposed in today's notice, DOE estimates capital conversion costs of $1.88 million and product conversion costs of $3.75 million for a typical small manufacturer in the first group (manufacturers that produce specialized motors previously not covered by Federal standards). Meanwhile, DOE estimates a typical large manufacturer would incur capital and product conversion costs of $3.29 million and $7.25 million, respectively, at the same TSL. Small manufacturers that predominately produce specialty motors would face higher relative capital conversion costs at TSL 2 than large manufacturers because large manufacturers have been independently pursuing higher efficiency motors as a result of the efficiency standards prescribed by EISA 2007 (10 CFR part 431.25) and consequently have built up more design and production experience. Large manufacturers have also been innovating as a result of the small electric motors rulemaking at 75 FR 10874 (March 9, 2010), which exempted many of the specialized equipment that these small business manufacturers produce. Many large manufacturers of general purpose motors offer equipment that was covered by the 2010 small electric motors rule, as well as equipment that falls under this proposed rule. Small manufactures pointed out that this would give large manufacturers an advantage in that they already have experience with the technology necessary to redesign their equipment and are familiar with the steps they will have to take to upgrade their manufacturing equipment and processes. Small manufactures, whose specialized motors were not required to meet the standards prescribed by the small electric motors rule and EISA 2007 have not undergone these processes and, therefore, would have to put more time and resources into redesign efforts., 945503=55. Because motor efficiency varies from unit to unit, even within a specific model, NEMA has established a list of standardized efficiency values that manufacturers use when labeling their motors. Each incremental step, or \u201cband,\u201d constitutes a 10 percent change in motor losses. NEMA MG 1-2011 Table 12-10 contains the list of NEMA nominal efficiencies., 128825=J. Review Under the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001, 505770=DOE developed average distributor and contractor markups by examining the contractor cost estimates provided by RS Means Electrical Cost Data 2013. [63] DOE calculates baseline and overall incremental markups based on the equipment markups at each step in the distribution chain. The incremental markup relates the change in the manufacturer sales price of higher efficiency models (the incremental cost increase) to the change in the customer price. Chapter 6 of the NOPR TSD addresses estimating markups., 577086=The flat markup scenario assumed that the cost of goods sold for each product is marked up by a flat percentage to cover SG expenses, R expenses, interest expenses, and profit. There were two values used for the flat markup, a 1.37 markup for high volume representative units and a 1.45 markup for low volume representative units. The 1.37 markup was used for the Design B, 5-horsepower representative unit; the Design C, 5-horsepower representative unit; the fire pump, 5-horsepower representative unit; and the brake, 5-horsepower representative unit. The 1.45 markup is used for the Design B, 30-horsepower and 75-horsepower representative units; the Design C, 50 horsepower representative unit; the fire pump, 30-horsepower and 75-horsepower representative units; and the brake, 30-horsepower and 75-horsepower representative units. This scenario represents the upper bound of industry profitability in the standards case because manufacturers are able to fully pass through additional costs due to standards to their customers. To derive the flat markup percentages, DOE examined the SEC 10-Ks of publicly traded electric motor manufacturers to estimate the industry average gross margin percentage. DOE then used that estimate along with the flat manufacturer markups used in the small electric motors rulemaking at 75 FR 10874 (March 9, 2010), since several of the small electric motor manufacturers are also manufacturers of electric motors covered in this rulemaking, to create a final estimate of the flat markups used for electric motors covered in this rulemaking., 534916=For the NOPR, DOE retained the same approach to estimate the base case efficiency distribution in 2012, but it updated the base case efficiency distributions to account for the NOPR engineering analysis (revised ELs) and for the update in the scope of electric motors considered in the analysis. Beyond 2012, DOE assumed the efficiency distributions for equipment class group 1 and 4 vary over time based on historical data [72] for the market penetration of NEMA Premium motors within the market for integral alternating current induction motors. The assumed trend is shown in chapter 10 of the NOPR TSD. For equipment class group 2 and 3, which represent a very minor share of the market (less than 0.2 percent), DOE believes the overall trend in efficiency improvement for the total integral AC induction motors may not be representative, so DOE kept the base case efficiency distributions in the compliance year equal to 2012 levels., 856605=Issued in Washington, DC, on November 25, 2013., 924341=14. The Petition is available at: http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EERE-2010-BT-STD-0027-0035., 873716=(c) Except as provided for fire pump electric motors in paragraph (b) of this section, each general purpose electric motor (subtype II) with a power rating of 1 horsepower or greater, but not greater than 200 horsepower, including a NEMA Design B or an equivalent IEC Design N motor that is a general purpose electric motor (subtype II), manufactured (alone or as a component of another piece of equipment) on or after December 19, 2010, but before December 19, 2015, shall have a nominal full-load efficiency that is not less than the following:, 165996=The industry net present value (INPV) is the sum of the discounted cash flows to the industry from the base year through the end of the analysis period (2013 to 2044). Using a real discount rate of 9.1 percent, DOE estimates that the industry net present value (INPV) for manufacturers of electric motors is $3,371.2 million in 2012$. Under the proposed standards, DOE expects that manufacturers may lose up to 8.4 percent of their INPV, which corresponds to approximately $283.5 million. Additionally, based on DOE's interviews with the manufacturers of electric motors, DOE does not expect any plant closings or significant loss of employment based on the energy conservation standards chosen in today's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR)., 896688=(i) Starting on December 19, 2015, each NEMA Design C electric motor that is an electric motor meeting the criteria in paragraph (g) of this section and with a power rating from 1 horsepower through 200 horsepower, but excluding non-integral brake electric motors and integral brake electric motors, manufactured (alone or as a component of another piece of equipment) shall have a nominal full-load efficiency that is not less than the following:, 239309=As noted above, 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B) prevents DOE from adopting a standard for a covered product unless such standard would result in \u201csignificant\u201d energy savings. Although the term \u201csignificant\u201d is not explicitly defined in EPCA, the U.S. Court of Appeals, in Natural Resources Defense Council v. Herrington, 768 F.2d 1355, 1373 (D.C. Cir. 1985), indicated that Congress intended \u201csignificant\u201d energy savings in this context to be savings that were not \u201cgenuinely trivial.\u201d DOE believes that the energy savings for all of the TSLs considered in this rulemaking (presented in section V.A) are nontrivial, and, therefore, DOE considers them \u201csignificant\u201d within the meaning of section 325 of EPCA., 849316=13. DOE seeks comment on its proposed compliance date of December 19, 2015., 365461=BBF and the CDA commented that there are copper die-casting facilities in the U.S.\u2014specifically in Colorado and Ohio\u2014as well as in Mexico. They added that die-cast rotor motors have been produced for North American service since 2005, and some of these motors meet NEMA Design B requirements. The CDA and BBF added that multiple high-volume manufacturers in Europe and Asia have produced tens of thousands of die-cast copper rotor motors that satisfy the NEMA-specified performance requirements that meet or exceed the NEMA Premium levels. These motors have been sold to North American users. (BBF, No. 51 at pp. 2, 3) DOE was able to purchase and tear down a 5-hp copper rotor motor from an Asian manufacturer that performed at DOE's max-tech efficiency level, as well as the performance requirements for NEMA Design B., 918286=[FR Doc. 2013-28776 Filed 12-5-13; 8:45 am], 920475=7.

Vaughen's (2011, 2013), Vaughen's Motor & Pump Repair Price Guide, 2011, 2013 Edition. http://www.vaughens.com/., 677507=Based on 2011 ASM data and interviews with manufacturers, DOE estimates approximately 60 percent of electric motors sold in the U.S. are manufactured domestically. Using this assumption, DOE estimates that in the absence of new and amended energy conservation standards, there would be approximately 7,237 domestic production workers involved in manufacturing all electric motors covered by this rulemaking in 2015. The table below shows the range of potential impacts of new and amended energy conservation standards for all ECGs on U.S. production workers in the electric motor industry. However, because ECG 1 motors comprise more than 97 percent of the electric motors covered by this rulemaking, DOE believes that potential changes in domestic employment will be driven primarily by the standards that are selected for ECG 1, Design A and B electric motors., 268015=Based on currently available data, DOE estimates that approximately 270,000 polyphase, open 56-frame special and definite purpose motors (1-hp or greater) were shipped in 2011 and at least 70% of these motors have efficiency levels below NEMA Premium. [25] In addition, based on this data, DOE believes that establishing TSL 2 for this subset of 56-frame motors would result in national energy savings of 0.58 quads (full-fuel-cycle) and net present value savings of $1.11 billion (2012$), with a 7 percent discount rate. [26] DOE has not merged its data and analyses related to this subset of 56-frame motors with the other analyses in today's NOPR. As described above, DOE seeks additional information that can be incorporated into its final analysis., 953011=73.

Comments may be submitted using any of the following methods:, 552788=DOE estimated energy consumption and savings based on site energy and converted the electricity consumption and savings to primary energy using annual conversion factors derived from the AEO 2013 version of the NEMS. Cumulative energy savings are the sum of the NES for each year over the timeframe of the analysis., 226892=Consistent with EISA 2007's reworking of the definition, the 2012 test procedure final rule broadly defined the term \u201celectric motor.\u201d at 10 CFR 431.12. (77 FR 26608 (May 4, 2012)). That definition covers \u201cgeneral purpose,\u201d \u201cspecial purpose\u201d and \u201cdefinite purpose\u201d electric motors (as defined by EPCA). As noted above, EPCA did not require either \u201cspecial purpose\u201d or \u201cdefinite purpose\u201d motor types to meet energy conservation standards because they were not considered \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d under the EPCA definition of \u201cgeneral purpose motor\u201d\u2014a necessary element to meet the pre-EISA 2007 \u201celectric motor\u201d definition. See 77 FR 26612. Because of the restrictive nature of the prior electric motor definition, along with the restrictive definition of the term \u201cindustrial equipment,\u201d DOE would have been unable to set standards for such motors without this change. (See 42 U.S.C. 6311(2)(B) (2006) (limiting the scope of equipment covered under EPCA)) In view of the changes introduced by EISA 2007 and the absence of energy conservation standards for special purpose and definite purpose motors, as noted in chapter 2 of DOE's July 2012 electric motors preliminary analysis technical support document (TSD), [16] it is DOE's view that both of these motors are categories of \u201celectric motors\u201d covered under EPCA, as currently amended. Accordingly, DOE is proposing standards for certain definite purpose and special purpose motors. To this end, DOE is considering setting energy conservation standards for those motors that exhibit all of the following nine characteristics:, 828957=DOE has determined, under Executive Order 12630, \u201cGovernmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights\u201d 53 FR 8859 (Mar. 18, 1988), that this proposed regulation would not result in any takings that might require compensation under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution., 545936=To make the analysis more accessible and transparent to all interested parties, DOE used an MS Excel spreadsheet model to calculate the energy savings and the national customer costs and savings from each TSL. [77] DOE used the NIA spreadsheet to calculate the NES and NPV, based on the annual energy consumption and total installed cost data from the energy use analysis and the LCC analysis. DOE forecasted the lifetime energy savings, energy cost savings, equipment costs, and NPV of customer benefits for each product class for equipment sold from 2015 through 2044. In addition, DOE analyzed scenarios that used inputs from the AEO 2013 Low Economic Growth and High Economic Growth cases. These cases have higher and lower energy price trends compared to the reference case., 166927=DOE's analyses indicate that the proposed standards would save a significant amount of energy. Estimated lifetime savings for electric motors purchased over the 30-year period that begins in the year of compliance with new and amended standards (2015-2044) would amount to 7.0 quads (full-fuel-cycle energy). [4] The annualized energy savings (0.23 quads) are equivalent to one percent of total U.S. industrial primary energy consumption in 2011. [5], 945014=54. EPACT 1992 only established efficiency standards for motors up to and including 200 hp. Eventually, NEMA MG 1-2011 added a table, 20-A, which functioned as an extension of Table 12-11. So, although EPACT 1992 is a slight misnomer, DOE is using it to refer to those ELs that were based on Table 12-11.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "In accordance with these and other statutory provisions discussed in this notice, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposes amending the energy conservation standards for electric motors by applying the standards currently in place to a wider scope of electric motors for which DOE does not currently regulate. In setting these standards, DOE is proposing to address a number of different groups of electric motors that have, to date, not been required to satisfy the energy conservation standards currently set out in 10 CFR part 431. In addition, with the exception of fire pump electric motors, the proposal would require all currently regulated motors to satisfy the efficiency levels prescribed in Table 12-12 and Table 20-B2 of MG1-2011, published by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association; fire pump motors would continue to meet the current standards that apply. All other electric motors that DOE is proposing to regulate would also need to meet these efficiency levels (i.e. Tables 12-12 and 20-B). As a practical matter, the many currently regulated motors would continue to be required to meet the standards that they already meet, but certain motors, such as those that satisfy the general purpose electric motors (subtype II) (\u201csubtype II\u201d) or that are NEMA Design B motors from 201 through 500 horsepower, would need to meet the more stringent levels prescribed by MG1-2011 Tables 12-12 and 20-B.
