The proposed changes would apply beginning with the 2016 capital plan and stress test cycles. For all banking organizations, the proposal would remove the tier 1 common capital ratio requirement. For large bank holding companies, the proposal would modify the stress test capital action assumptions. For banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches, the proposal would delay the incorporation of the supplementary leverage ratio for one year and indefinitely defer the use of the advanced approaches risk-based capital framework in the capital plan and stress test rules. For bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, the proposal would eliminate the fixed assumptions regarding dividend payments for company-run stress tests and delay the application of stress testing for these savings and loan holding companies for one year. The proposal would also make certain technical amendments to the capital plan and stress test rules to incorporate changes related to other rulemakings.}",
