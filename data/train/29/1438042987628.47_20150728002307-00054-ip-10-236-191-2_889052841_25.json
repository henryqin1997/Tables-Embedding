Bubba Starling, OF, Kansas City Royals; 8/3/1992, 366344=41. Max Fried, LHP, San Diego Padres; 1/18/1994, 65563=5. Taijuan Walker, RHP, Seattle Mariners; 8/13/1992, 382850=99. Clayton Blackburn, RHP, San Francisco Giants; 1/6/1993, 375681=74. Erik Johnson, RHP, Chicago White Sox; 12/30/1989, 378267=83. Enny Romero, LHP, Tampa Bay Rays; 1/24/1991, 201252=Gerrit Cole has taken the reigns from Taillon as the Pirates\u2019 No.1 starter, but he does have the skills to help guide Cole and the Bucs to another postseason appearance in 2013, likely joining the rotation mid-season like Cole and developing the final touches on his stuff at the major league level. Taillon doesn\u2019t look to have the ceiling that Cole does, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he isn\u2019t special. The 2013 season was a bit disappointing statistically, so the 2014 season will go a long way in determining the long-term outlook on this young man., 100209=A lot of Bradley\u2019s success had to do with his ability to throw more strikes. He went from walking 5.5 per nine in 2012 to 4.1 in 2013, and if he maintains that type of growth in the upper minors, he\u2019ll be ready for Chase Field in no time. With the stuff that he has, you\u2019d like to see him allow fewer base runners, but there was a time that I doubted Matt Harvey and Clayton Kershaw for the same reasons. I won\u2019t be doing that again., 376539=77. Alberto Tirado, RHP, Toronto Blue Jays; 12/10/1994, 372160=61. Henry Owens, LHP, Boston Red Sox; 7/21/1992, 254457=18. George Springer, OF, Houston Astros; 9/19/1989, 374138=68. Trevor Bauer, RHP, Cleveland Indians; 1/17/1991, 378533=84. Victor Sanchez, RHP, Seattle Mariners; 1/30/1995, 374970=71. Sean Manaea, LHP, Kansas City Royals; 2/1/1992, 379937=89. Jake Marisnick, OF, Miami Marlins; 3/30/1991, 30370=Bogaerts forced himself into the Red Sox immediate plans and has played a major role for the Sox in the 2013 postseason. The young infielder could take the everyday job at short in 2014 with Stephen Drew reaching free agency, and his production up the middle could make him one of the top fantasy shortstops this side of Troy Tulowitzki., 31588=3. Oscar Taveras, OF, St. Louis Cardinals; 6/19/1992, 317098=Sanchez is the pitching equivalent to Oscar Taveras: Electric, game-changing stuff\u2026he just can\u2019t stay on the field. In 2013, it was the shoulder, which is always scary when it comes to a pitcher with a high-90\u2019s fastball, that led to Sanchez missing time. Beyond the injuries, the walks are also an issue. The issues are obvious in Sanchez and his inability to reach his ceiling, but the fact that he has the stuff to be a No.1 starter and he is entering his age-21 season, they\u2019re worth holding out for. The Jays will hope that this is the year that he puts it all together., 376824=78. Lance McCullers, RHP, Houston Astros; 10/2/1993, 368575=49. Kohl Stewart, RHP, Minnesota Twins; 10/7/1994, 253305=Castellanos did take a few more walks in 2013, so that is a great step in his development, as his long swing and inability to take a walk was a concern for many prospect graders in the past. With the trade of Prince Fielder to the Texas Rangers, it looks like Castellanos will move back to third base, with Miguel Cabrera sliding back across the diamond to first. As a corner outfielder, Castellanos\u2019 production was likely a bit lacking, but with just a few consistent producers at the hot corner, a young player like this capable of 15-20 home runs and 30-plus doubles is a nice addition to the field. If he maintains his improved approach, Castellanos could be a real candidate for the 2014 AL Rookie of the Year., 368289=48. Michael Foltynewicz, RHP, Houston Astros; 10/7/1991, 88079=6. Archie Bradley, RHP, Arizona Diamondbacks; 8/10/1992, 361774=26. Jorge Soler, OF, Chicago Cubs; 2/25/1992, 368021=47. Jackie Bradley, OF, Boston Red Sox; 4/19/1990, 373855=67. Julio Urias, LHP, Los Angeles Dodgers; 8/12/1996, 367745=46. Colin Moran, 3B, Miami Marlins; 10/1/1992, 373300=65. Jesse Winker, OF, Cincinnati Reds; 8/17/1993, 369439=52. Tyler Glasnow, RHP, Pittsburgh Pirates; 8/23/1993, 302066=21. Aaron Sanchez, RHP, Toronto Blue Jays; 4/1/1992, 376257=76. Alen Hanson, SS, Pittsburgh Pirates; 10/22/1992, 373013=64. Arismendy Alcantara, 2B/SS, Chicago Cubs; 10/29/1991, 299329=Martinez has earned a lot of Pedro Martinez comparisons due to his size and being a Dominican Republic native, but the stuff is also involved in those comps. Carlos Martinez is quite capable of dominating in the majors in 2014, but he still needs a rotation spot, and that is the lone reason for his ranking. The Cardinals depth is scary, as Trevor Rosenthal and Martinez appear bullpen bound for the next several seasons with Adam Wainwright, Michael Wacha, Shelby Miller, Lance Lynn, Joe Kelly, and Jaime Garcia ahead of them on the depth charts, and while a trade seems easy to say as a bystander, why would you deal any of those guys? Martinez will be dominant in whatever role he fills, but he slides to 20 due to his unknown future role., 362270=27. Austin Meadows, OF, Pittsburgh Pirates; 5/3/1995, 372736=63. Nick Williams, OF, Texas Rangers; 9/8/1993, 328266=23. Dylan Bundy, RHP, Baltimore Orioles; 11/15/1992, 363939=33. Billy Hamilton, OF, Cincinnati Reds; 9/9/1990, 133374=10. Francisco Lindor, SS, Cleveland Indians; 11/14/1993, 375976=75. A.J. Cole, RHP, Washington Nationals; 1/5/1992, 373579=66. C.J. Edwards, RHP, Chicago Cubs; 9/3/1991, 48850=Taveras is the best pure hitter in the minors, but he needs to stay on the field to show his true abilities. With Carlos Beltran headed towards free agency, it will be interesting to see how the Cardinals handle Taveras going into the 2014 season. With Matt Adams producing solid numbers in a limited role, it could force Allen Craig to the outfield, which would force Taveras to Triple-A or to center field in place of Jon Jay. Wherever he is, expect big things., 371842=60.\u00a0Gary Sanchez, C, New York Yankees; 12/2/1992, 50148=4. Miguel Sano, 3B, Minnesota Twins; 5/11/1993, 343222=24. Kyle Zimmer, RHP, Kansas City Royals; 9/13/1991, 365069=37. Joc Pederson, OF, Los Angeles Dodgers; 4/21/1992, 179129=13. Robert Stephenson, RHP, Cincinnati Reds; 2/24/1993, 146319=11. Kevin Gausman, RHP, Baltimore Orioles; 1/6/1991, 364508=35. Jonathan Singleton, 1B, Houston Astros; 9/18/1991, 268155=19. Jonathan Gray, RHP, Colorado Rockies; 11/5/1991, 378816=85. Matt Barnes, RHP, Boston Red Sox; 6/17/1990, 364231=34. Mark Appel, RHP, Houston Astros; 7/15/1991, 9312=2. Xander Bogaerts, SS/3B, Boston Red Sox; 10/1/1992, 202020=15. Gregory Polanco, OF, Pittsburgh Pirates; 9/14/1991, 101075=7. Carlos Correa, SS, Houston Astros; 9/22/1994, 363392=31. Travis d\u2019Arnaud, C, New York Mets; 2/10/1989, 379652=88. Brian Goodwin, OF, Washington Nationals; 11/2/1990, 342325=Bundy missed all of the 2013 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery, but he was near the top of everyone\u2019s lists prior to the injury. With the going success rates of the surgery, Bundy could jump right back to where he was when he returns this season. The Orioles will be very cautious with him, but he should be looked at a lot like Stephen Strasburg was \u2013 he was an ace-level talent who was hurt, had surgery, and was thought of an ace again once healthy., 110388=Correa has a great skill-set, one that prompted a lot of Alex Rodriguez comparisons when he was the No.1 overall pick in the 2012 MLB Draft. Unfortunately, the comparisons may never stop for Correa, who may have to be linked to Buxton, who was taken No.2 overall in the 2012 Draft, over the rest of his career. Fortunately for Correa, he is also capable of All-Star level production, so this won\u2019t become a Sam Bowie versus Michael Jordan issue for the Houston Astros. Correa is likely in for an absolutely incredible breakout in 2014 as the doubles head over the wall and he continues to make solid adjustments at the plate. Like Bogaerts, he could be as elite as they come at shortstop, likely arriving by mid-2015., 318162=22. Lucas Giolito, RHP, Washington Nationals; 7/14/1994, 365507=38. Clint Frazier, OF, Cleveland Indians; 9/6/1994, 189273=14. Jameson Taillon, RHP, Pittsburgh Pirates; 11/18/1991, 363109=30. Corey Seager, SS, Los Angeles Dodgers; 4/27/1994, 364792=36. Alex Meyer, RHP, Minnesota Twins; 1/3/1990, 370417=55. Raul Mondesi, SS, Kansas City Royals; 7/27/1995, 369878=53. James Paxton, LHP, Seattle Mariners; 11/6/1988, 145498=Lindor will have tremendous value for the Indians with his above-average defensive skills, but it won\u2019t stop there. While Lindor won\u2019t be a middle-of-the-order talent like Bogaerts and Correa, he has the skill-set to be a very effective leadoff hitter, while having the contact skills to be a great No.2 hitter, setting the table for Jason Kipnis and Carlos Santana, likely by mid-2014., 362836=29. Yordano Ventura, RHP, Kansas City Royals; 6/3/1991, 379094=86. David Dahl, OF, Colorado Rockies; 4/1/1994, 367184=44. Eddie Butler, RHP, Colorado Rockies; 3/13/1991, 371003=57. D.J. Peterson, 3B, Seattle Mariners; 12/31/1991, 111590=8. Javier Baez, SS, Chicago Cubs; 12/1/1992, 163973=12. Noah Syndergaard, RHP, New York Mets; 8/29/1992, 370147=54. Kolten Wong, 2B, St. Louis Cardinals; 10/10/1990, 370727=56. Jorge Alfaro, C, Texas Rangers; 6/11/1993, 8693=Buxton is the minor league version of Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout. He has tools across the board and could continue to move quickly, likely reaching Target Field by the end of the 2014 season.\u00a0While he isn\u2019t the pure hitter that Taveras could be, Buxton has the skill set that will fill stadiums and force Minnesota into contention\u2026if they could get some solid pitching., 359899=Bryant\u2019s long-term position remains a mystery, but wherever he ends up, he will likely be producing All-Star level numbers, with a whole lot of swing and miss ability. The Cubs have quite a few middle infield options (Junior Lake, Javier Baez, Starlin Castro, Arismendy Alcantara, Darwin Barney) and someone will be moved to third (likely Baez), but Bryant at first, left, or right is just as potent. The transition to a different position could lead to some offensive struggles, but the fans on Sheffield Avenue and Waveland Avenue will see quite a few home runs starting sometime in 2014, as Bryant quickly rises through the Cubs strong offensive system. ., 275906=20. Carlos Martinez, RHP, St. Louis Cardinals; 9/21/1991, 367465=45. Garin Cecchini, 3B, Boston Red Sox; 4/20/1991, 399462=Pingback: 2014 MLB Top 100 Prospects \u00ab The Baseball Haven, 449499=Pingback: 2014 MLB Predictions and Useless Guesses \u00ab The Baseball Haven, 353054=25. Kris Bryant, 3B/OF, Chicago Cubs; 1/4/1992, 123729=9. Addison Russell, SS, Oakland Athletics; 1/23/1994, 231444=17. Nick Castellanos, 3B/OF, Detroit Tigers; 3/4/1992, 379371=87. Reese McGuire, C, Pittsburgh Pirates; 3/2/1995, 377685=81. Zach Lee, RHP, Los Angeles Dodgers; 9/13/1991, 383139=100. Jimmy Nelson, RHP, Milwaukee Brewers; 6/5/1989, 377404=80. Rafael Montero, RHP, New York Mets; 10/17/1990, 266413=Like Castellanos, Springer takes some shots due to his strikeout totals; however, his all-around game could still allow for success at the major league level. Just three home runs shy of posting a 40/40 season in 2013, Springer would have likely had a bigger impact on the Astros winning games than any of the group of Brandon Barnes, J.D. Martinez, L.J. Hoes, Robbie Grossman, and Trevor Crowe that helped Houston lose 111 games in 2013. While it seems unreasonable to expect 40/40 production in the majors, Springer could provide seasons of 25 HR/25 SB annually, which will be quite valuable once the club\u2019s elite prospects join him in Houston and the Astros begin contending in the next few years., 381465=94. Joey Gallo, 1B/3B, Texas Rangers; 11/19/1993, 368855=50. Marcus Stroman, RHP, Toronto Blue Jays; 5/1/1991, 366906=43. Andrew Heaney, LHP, Miami Marlins; 6/5/1991, 380912=92. Anthony Ranaudo, RHP, Boston Red Sox; 9/9/1989, 132747=The A\u2019s were SUPER aggressive with Russell in 2013, starting the season with the California League (high-A) affiliate after getting just 58 at-bats for the club\u2019s low-A squad in 2012 and getting all of 217 at-bats in his first professional season. He did so well in 2013 that he was bumped to Triple-A to assist with Sacramento\u2019s playoff push, and while he was over-matched, it shows just how highly Oakland thinks of him. He may get lost in the dynamic shortstop shuffle, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Russell in the majors first, producing solid overall numbers and bringing life to the Oakland lineup., 380645=91. Alex Colome, RHP, Tampa Bay Rays; 12/31/1988, 371565=59. Lucas Sims, RHP, Atlanta Braves; 5/10/1994, 374408=69. Jonathan Schoop, 2B/SS, Baltimore Orioles; 10/16/1991, 374684=70. J.P. Crawford, SS, Philadelphia Phillies; 1/11/1995, 221093=16. Albert Almora, OF, Chicago Cubs; 4/16/1994, 327578=After having Tommy John surgery, Giolito came back with a vengeance in 2013, showcasing the electric arm and stuff that made him the 16th overall pick in 2012, despite possessing said cranky elbow at the time of his selection. Giolito has No.1 stuff, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Washington be very aggressive with the 6\u20196\u2033, 225 pound right-hander, likely starting him in Low-A Hagerstown, with a brief appearance for High-A Potomac by years end., 380359=90. Maikel Franco, 3B, Philadelphia Phillies; 8/26/1992, 375136=72. Jake Odorizzi, RHP, Tampa Bay Rays; 3/27/1990, 178449=The stuff is off the charts, at least the fastball, and with further development of his secondary stuff, Syndergaard will be a tremendous No.2 starter for the Mets. The haul from the R.A. Dickey trade certainly took a major bump upwards when Syndergaard showed such drastic improvement, and after reaching Double-A in 2013 and the injury to Harvey, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the tall right-hander get a shot before the All-Star break in 2014., 366068=40. Rougned Odor, 2B, Texas Rangers; 2/3/1994, 375404=73. Blake Swihart, C, Boston Red Sox; 4/3/1992, 381193=93. Chris Owings, SS, Arizona Diamondbacks; 8/12/1991, 365788=39. Matt Wisler, RHP, San Diego Padres; 9/12/1992, 483650=\u00a9 2001-2015 MLB Advanced Media, L.P. All rights reserved., 188301=Stephenson\u2019s numbers were absurd in 2013. I saw a start in Dayton that he looked like he was toying with the opposition, but that seems to be the norm for him. He has a tremendous fastball, touching triple-digits several times during the 2013 campaign, and he earned promotions (a quick one from the pitching-deadly California League) by succeeding. The Reds will likely slow down the process and keep him in Double-A most of the 2014 season, but he could be a reliable starter by 2015, just in time for the possible loss of Mat Latos and Johnny Cueto., 377121=79. Eddie Rosario, 2B/OF, Minnesota Twins; 9/28/1991, 275170=Despite taking some medication for ADHD and looking like a potential slider in the 2013 MLB Draft, the Rockies jumped at the chance to draft Gray and his incredible fastball and the results were nothing short of sexy. Coor\u2019s Field will continue to be a question mark when it comes to the ceiling of pitching prospects for Colorado, but I can\u2019t remember a time that the Rockies have had a pitcher like this. Lockdown, shutdown stuff like Gray\u2019s will be very useful if the Rockies are ever going to contend in the NL West. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see Gray in the top five at the end of next season, possibly even the mid-season lists, and his electric fastball and slider should suit him well in the thin, Denver air., 369138=51. Eduardo Rodriguez, LHP, Baltimore Orioles; 4/7/1993, 122926=Swinging hard and quick, Baez unravels his coiled body and creates impressive power\u2026which comes with impressive strikeout totals, as well. With Starlin Castro signed long-term, Baez is going to likely be moved off of shortstop, but he has the stick to play third or an outfield corner. The Cubs are aggressive in how they handle their prospects, but we\u2019ll have to see if the Theo Epstein regime is going to be wise with the cost-efficiency and service-time issues that could arise by allowing Baez to get some time in at Wrigley in 2014. He could force their hand, though., 366622=42. Kyle Crick, RHP, San Francisco Giants; 11/30/1992, 382289=97. Dorssys Paulino, SS, Cleveland Indians; 11/21/1994, 352625=Zimmer struggled for some time last season before everything just clicked and he was an absolute monster. There is an adjustment period in many prospects, and the Zimmer who was electric and dominant is the pitcher that the Royals and the rest of us should expect going forward. If the Royals are competitive in 2014, Zimmer will be a viable option to guide them to the playoffs down the stretch., 362553=28. Hunter Harvey, RHP, Baltimore Orioles; 12/9/1994, 382028=96. Mike Olt, 1B/3B, Chicago Cubs; 8/27/1988, 377965=82. Miguel Almonte, RHP, Kansas City Royals; 4/4/1993, 371285=58. Phillip Ervin, OF, Cincinnati Reds; 7/17/1992, 382574=98. Trey Ball, LHP, Boston Red Sox; 6/27/1994, 381744=95. Jorge Bonifacio, OF, Kansas City Royals; 6/4/1993}",
