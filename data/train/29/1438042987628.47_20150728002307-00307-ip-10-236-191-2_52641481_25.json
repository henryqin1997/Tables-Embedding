Newton and Brees were both intercepted before Carolina's Olindo Mare and New Orleans' John Kasay connected on field goals. Mare made a 41-yard attempt, while Kasay kicked a 43-yarder with 2:42 left., 77033=However, New Orleans re-gained the lead on its next touch. Marques Colston needed to stretch across his body while he was in the air to catch Brees' pass to the back of the end zone. The 15-yard grab made it a 14-7 game with 2:50 left in the quarter.}",
