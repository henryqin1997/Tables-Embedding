    "textAfterTable": "Ladders in brief By entering a ladder you are committing to a maximum of two games. One game you initiate by challenging a player within 10 places above you, and the other when challenged by a player below you on the ladder. You cannot refuse challenges and must defend your position. You will play a randomly selected color on all ladder games. If you challenge a player above you and win, you will move above your opponent's current position. If you lose or draw, no change takes place. For further information about ladder games please read the ladder help pages.
