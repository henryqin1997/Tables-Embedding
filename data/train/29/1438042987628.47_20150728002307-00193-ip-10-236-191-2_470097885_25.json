No. 7,302,410, entitled \u201cEconometric Optimization Engine\u201d, by Krishna Venkatraman, Phil Delurgio, Suzanne Valentine, Michael Neal, and Hau Lee, which are all incorporated by reference herein for all purposes., 878343=In the preferred embodiment, the solutions from the valuation step 2404 are used to determine which offers to accept and to generate a feasible event schedule that ensures that the retailer runs all the events required by each accepted offer while simultaneously meeting a number of other constraints. These constraints enforce capacity limits on the type and number of events that can be run each week and over the promotion interval. They ensure that accepted offers are not mutually exclusive and that the schedule and composition of events satisfy constraints on brand and product promotion frequency. Finally they ensure that every event has sufficient ad and display capacity for all the offers that require it to be run. The objective of the selection step 2408 is to maximize the sum of the valuation step scores of the accepted offers and events., 1202724=This promotional optimization is a full optimization problem P1 described earlier with the decision variables IEe,t and IOe,t set to the values obtained in selection step 2408 and the variables IAEp,e,t and IDEp,e,t set to the values obtained in the reconciliation step 2412. The only variables over which the calendar construction step 2416 performs an optimization are the TPR variables ITPREp,e,t and TPRp,t. The outcome of this program is the final optimized promotion calendar., 205619=In a similar vein, equivalent base price and equivalent base units are calculated (Step 1305) using the imputed values for base price (for example, as determined in Steps 1201-1207) and for base units (also referred to as base volume which is determined as disclosed below)., 879245=In the reconciliation step 2412, the composition of the ad and display vehicles is reconciled within each event with the offer and event schedule from the selection step 2408. This involves solving an integer problem to ensure that all events that each selected offer requires promotes at least one product from the offer in their ad and display vehicles., 1202140=In the calendar construction step 2416 full promotional optimization program is run with the decision variables for events IEe,t and offers, IOo,t, set to their optimal values from the selection step 2408. The display and ad variables tied to events, IDEp,e,r and IAEp,e,r, also get set automatically since they are completely determined by the values of IEe,t and the composition of each ad and display within each chosen event. The TPR values are recomputed for each product here., 175781=The initial base price values generated above provide satisfactory values for the imputed base price variable which may be output (Step 1207) and used for most purposes. However, optional Steps 1209-1217 describe an approach for generating a more refined imputed base price variable., 171136=The foregoing steps (1011-1031) concern cleansing the raw econometric data to create an error detected and error corrected (\u201ccleansed\u201d) initial dataset. The cleansed initial dataset created in the foregoing steps can now be used to generate a variety of useful imputed econometric variables (Step 1033). These imputed econometric variables are useful in their own right and may also be output for use in further processing (Step 1035). One particularly useful application of the imputed econometric variables is that they can be input into an optimization engine which collects data input from a variety of sources and processes the data to provide very accurate economic modeling information., 879647=Finally in the calendar construction step 2416, the final promotion solution is constructed by using decisions made in the selection step 2408 and the reconciliation step 2412 to set the promotion levels of each product in each period for each promotional activity (ad display or TPR) and computing the resulting profit., 170732=The net result of execution of the process Steps 1011-1031 disclosed hereinabove is the generation of a cleansed initial dataset which can be used for its own purpose or input into other econometric processes. One such process is the generation of imputed econometric variables., 176118=In generating a more refined imputed base price variable, the effect of promotional (or discount) pricing is addressed (Steps 1209-1217). This may be calculated by specifying a discount criteria (Step 1209); defining price steps (Step 1211); outputting an imputed base price variable and an imputed discount variable (Step 1213); analyzing the base price distribution (Step 1215); and outputting a refined base price variable (Step 1217)., 1175824=In the reconciliation step 2412, the composition of the ad and display vehicles is reconciled within each event with the offer and event schedule from selection step. This involves solving an integer problem to ensure that each event that each selected offer requires promotes at least one product from the offer in its ad and display activities., 178944=Further refining includes an analysis of the first step 1240. If the first step 1240 is short (along the time axis) and considerably lower than the next step 1230, it is assumed that the first step 1240 is based on a discounted price point 1222. As such, the value of the next step 1230 is treated as the base price for the time period of the first step 1241 (represented by the dashed line).}",

It should also be noted that there are many alternative ways of implementing the methods and apparatuses of the present invention. It is therefore intended that the following appended claims be interpreted as including all such alterations, permutations, and substitute equivalents as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention. Preferably, calendaring is the placing of at least four sequential promotional events in a schedule. Promotional events are designated and the promotional events are matched to offers. More preferably, calendaring is the placing of at least eight sequential promotional events in a schedule. Other embodiments of the invention may use coupons as a promotional activity. Other embodiments of the invention may use data from loyalty cards or club cards. In one embodiment of the invention, the retailer provides all of the information. In another embodiment of the invention, some of the information regarding offers is provided by the manufacturers or wholesalers (suppliers). In this embodiment, the suppliers may be able to see a list of the retailer's events. In another embodiment of the invention, a electronic offer template or form is used to provide offers to retailers. The system is able to use data in the offer template or form to provide",
