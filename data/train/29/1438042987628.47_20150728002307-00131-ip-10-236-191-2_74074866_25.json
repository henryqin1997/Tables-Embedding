Results are then assembled to form projected state and national scores, based on aggregated student results. NAEP does not provide school- or student-level results., 31103=In addition to FCAT 2.0 and FAA scores in each subject area, Florida\u2019s 2011-12 accountability results in mathematics include Algebra 1 EOC scores.

Florida\u2019s 2012-13 accountability results in science include Biology EOC assessment results. The Florida EOC Assessments are part of Florida's Next Generation Strategic Plan for the purpose of increasing student achievement and improving college and career readiness.
