Furthermore, while the objects described above are preferentially written in Visual C++, any other common programming language may be used as well. Finally, although the computer environment is preferentially a PC environment, either networked or stand-alone, other computer systems such as RISC servers, workstations, mainframes, or access to processors through the Internet may be substituted. The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments, and in particular the Example, are for the purposes of illustration and not limitation. The basic functions and methods set out in the following claims could be implemented in a variety of different ways using a variety of different techniques. For example, although use of computer technology is the preferred manner for implementing the invention, it could be implemented in a variety of other ways, including manually. Also, while the Example describes a particular software structure which implements the invention, the invention could be implemented using different types of hardware, operating systems, programming languages, database programs, etc. by one of ordinary skill in the art.
