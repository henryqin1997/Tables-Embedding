Each of Messrs. Lynch, Lombardi, Klipper and Riggio has extensive responsibility within the Company and performs duties that significantly affect the Company\u0092s overall performance and value. Accordingly, each of Messrs. Lynch, Lombardi, Klipper and Riggio was entitled to receive a target incentive compensation of 150% of base salary for achieving between 92% and 108% of the consolidated EBITDA target. They were entitled to receive an additional payment of up to 25% of base salary for achieving up to 112% or more of the consolidated EBITDA target., 518937=Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal 2011, 123886=Allen W.

Lynch, Lombardi and Klipper commenced on March\u00a017, 2010, will continue for a period of three years thereafter, and renew each year automatically for one year unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to automatic renewal. Following expiration of the initial terms of these employment agreements, the Compensation Committee will consider their continuing appropriateness on an annual basis. Mr.\u00a0Lynch\u0092s employment agreement superseded his prior employment agreement with the Company, dated January\u00a06, 2009. Mr.\u00a0Klipper\u0092s employment agreement superseded his prior employment agreement, dated February\u00a018, 2002, as amended., 336445=This column represents discretionary bonuses paid. Discretionary bonuses were paid to each of Messrs.

The Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate to grant Mr.\u00a0DeFelice guaranteed annual incentive compensation for Fiscal 2011 in order to induce him to accept his current position with the Company given the fact that the strategic process had already been announced. For Fiscal 2012, Mr.\u00a0DeFelice, who is responsible for all of the legal affairs of the Company on a worldwide basis but who does not have direct responsibility for the Company\u0092s financial and operational performance, will participate in the Company\u0092s Incentive Compensation Plan for Home Office Management., 424747=For similar reasons, except as set forth below with respect to certain one-time grants made to Messrs.

Further, under the option award agreements, if the holder were terminated within 24 months following a change of control, then the unvested options underlying the award or substitute award would immediately vest. Furthermore, under the restricted stock award agreements, if the holder were terminated other than for \u0093cause\u0094 within 24 months following a change of control, then the unvested shares of restricted stock underlying the award would immediately vest. Under the option and restricted stock award agreements executed under the 2004 Incentive Plan, \u0093change of control\u0094 generally means any of the following: (a)\u00a0a change of control of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item\u00a06(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; (b)\u00a0a merger or consolidation of the Company with another company; or (c)\u00a0a sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company to another company.

Such notice must contain the proposing stockholder\u0092s record name and address, and the class and number of shares of the Company which are beneficially owned by such stockholder. Such notice must also contain: (a)\u00a0a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, and (b)\u00a0any material interest of the proposing stockholder in such business. Similar notice must be given with respect to any stockholder nominees for director. Accordingly, the business of the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2012 shall not include voting on any stockholder nominee or proposal if proper notice as to such nominee or proposal is not properly delivered to the Company in accordance with the Company\u0092s Bylaws., 416357=The annual base salaries of Messrs.

Further, under the option award agreements, if the holder were terminated within 24 months following a change of control, then the unvested options underlying the award or substitute award would immediately vest. Furthermore, under the restricted stock award agreements, if the holder were terminated other than for \u0093cause\u0094 within 24 months following a change of control, then the unvested shares of restricted stock underlying the award would immediately vest. Under the option and restricted stock award agreements executed under the 2004 Incentive Plan, \u0093change of control\u0094 generally means any of the following: (a)\u00a0a change of control of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item\u00a06(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; (b)\u00a0a merger or consolidation of the Company with another company; or (c)\u00a0a sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company to another company.

He served as Chief Executive Officer from 1986 through February 2002. From 1965 and until its acquisition by the Company in September 2009, he was Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and the principal stockholder of Barnes\u00a0& Noble College Booksellers, Inc. (\u0093B&N College\u0094), one of the nation\u0092s largest operators of college bookstores. Since 1985, Mr.\u00a0Riggio has been a principal beneficial owner of MBS Textbook Exchange, Inc.

Mr.\u00a0Riggio is the brother of Stephen Riggio., 260030=highest paid officers (other than the Chief Financial Officer) unless (a)\u00a0the compensation is payable solely on account of the attainment of performance goals, (b)\u00a0the performance goals are determined by a committee of two or more outside directors, (c)\u00a0the material terms under which compensation is to be paid are disclosed to and approved by stockholders and (d)\u00a0the determining committee certifies that the performance goals were met. Because it is in the best interests of the Company to qualify to the maximum extent possible the compensation of its executives for deductibility under applicable tax laws, the Company obtained stockholder approval in June 2009 for the 2009 Executive Performance Plan and the 2009 Incentive Plan, which provide for the payment of compensation in compliance with Section\u00a0162(m) of the Code, and the Compensation Committee administers those plans in a manner intended to comply with Section\u00a0162(m) of the Code. However, it is possible that one or more grants may not qualify as performance-based awards as may be determined by the Internal Revenue Service or that, in limited circumstances, the Company may determine that it is in the best interests of the stockholders to pay awards that do not qualify as performance-based compensation under Section\u00a0162(m) of the Code., 710790=The undersigned hereby appoints Mr. Leonard Riggio and Mr. Eugene DeFelice, and each of them individually, as his true and lawful agents and proxies, with full power of substitution in each, and hereby authorizes them to represent and to vote, as designated on the reverse side hereof, all the shares of common stock of Barnes & Noble, Inc. that the undersigned is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at the Marriott Marquis, 1535 Broadway, New York, New York on October 28, 2011 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, and any adjournments or postponements thereof, with the same effect as if the undersigned were personally present and voting such shares, on all matters as further described in the Proxy Statement or that may otherwise come before the Annual Meeting., 68828=Patricia L. Higgins has been a Director of the Company since June 2006. Ms.\u00a0Higgins serves as Chair of the Audit Committee and as a member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Special Committee of the Board. Ms.\u00a0Higgins was President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Switch and Data Facilities Company, Inc., a leading provider of network interconnection and collocation services, from September 2000 to February 2004. Prior to that, she served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Research Board from May 1999 to August 2000 and Vice President and Chief Information Officer of Alcoa Inc. from January 1997 to April 1999. Ms.\u00a0Higgins is also a director of Travelers, Dycom Industries and Internap. During the previous five years, Ms.\u00a0Higgins also served as a director of Delta Air Lines, Visteon and SpectraSite Communications. Ms.\u00a0Higgins was a director of Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com from 1999 to 2004., 256834=Credited years of service under the Retirement Plan as of April\u00a030, 2011 for the named executive officers are: Mr.\u00a0Klipper \u0097 11.25 years and Ms.\u00a0Keating \u0097 2 years. Messrs. Lynch, Lombardi, Riggio and DeFelice are not participants in the Retirement Plan., 696796=Section\u00a016(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company\u0092s executive officers and Directors, and persons who own more than 10-percent of the Common Stock, to file initial statements of beneficial ownership of Common Stock (Form 3) and statements of changes in beneficial ownership of Common Stock (Forms 4 and 5) with the SEC. Executive officers, Directors and greater than 10-percent stockholders are required to furnish the Company with copies of all such forms they file., 241055=Under certain circumstances, the Compensation Committee may deem it appropriate to award discretionary bonuses to the named executive officers. Following the Compensation Committee\u0092s conclusion that the minimum EBITDA performance level was not achieved for Fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee considered factors that contributed to the actual consolidated EBITDA for Fiscal 2011, including the extraordinary legal and other costs (including the time and attention of management) attendant to the Company\u0092s recent proxy contest, derivative stockholder actions and ongoing review of strategic alternatives. The Compensation Committee determined that all these items were substantially outside of the control of the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee also determined that the proxy contest and review of strategic alternatives, as well as the Company\u0092s recent refinancing, represented significant extraordinary work for the named executive officers. Additionally, the Compensation Committee noted that the named executive officers had taken significant action during the year, and accomplished significant positive results, relating to the NOOK\u0099 (references to NOOK\u0099 include the Company\u0092s NOOK 1st Edition\u0099, NOOK Wi-Fi 1st Edition\u0099, NOOK Color\u0099 and The All-New NOOK\u0099 eBook Reader devices) and the Company\u0092s digital business, which favored the Company\u0092s long-term strategy and stockholder value creation, but which negatively impacted the Company\u0092s Fiscal 2011 consolidated EBITDA. The Compensation Committee resolved that it was appropriate to grant each of the named executive officers, other than Mr.\u00a0DeFelice whose annual incentive compensation was guaranteed by the Company in his employment agreement, a special discretionary bonus in an amount equivalent to what such executive would have received had the consolidated EBITDA component of their performance-based annual incentive compensation award been paid out at the 50%-of-target incentive level., 683402=All Other Fees.\u00a0\u00a0The Company did not pay to BDO any other fees in Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010., 395484=Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2011, 18397=Banks and Brokers May Call Collect: (212)\u00a0750-5833., 664026=GameStop Corp. (GameStop), a company in which Leonard Riggio is a member of the Board of Directors and a minority shareholder, operates departments within some of the Company\u0092s bookstores. GameStop pays a license fee to the Company in an amount equal to 7% of the gross sales of such departments, which totaled $989,000, $1,061,000, $250,000 and $1,250,000 during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, the transition period and fiscal 2008, respectively. GameStop sells new and used video games and consoles on the Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com website. Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com receives a commission on sales made by GameStop. For fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, the transition period and fiscal 2008, the commission earned by Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com was $356,000, $334,000, $76,000 and $531,000 respectively. Until June 2005, GameStop participated in the Company\u0092s worker\u0092s compensation, property and general liability insurance programs. The costs incurred by the Company under these programs were allocated to GameStop based upon GameStop\u0092s total payroll expense, property and equipment, and insurance claim history. GameStop reimbursed the Company for these services $51,000, $128,000, $62,000 and $162,000 during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, the transition period and fiscal 2008, respectively. Although GameStop secured its own insurance coverage, costs are continuing to be incurred by the Company on insurance claims which were made under its programs prior to June 2005 and any such costs applicable to insurance claims against GameStop will be charged to GameStop at the time incurred., 120280=Joseph J. Lombardi has been Chief Financial Officer of the Company since May 2003. Previously, he was Vice President and Controller from May 2002 to May 2003. Prior to joining the Company, Mr.\u00a0Lombardi served as Chief Financial Officer at The Museum Company, Inc. from August 1999 to May 2002. From August 1995 through July 1999, he was the Vice President and Controller of Toys \u0091R\u0092 Us, Inc. Prior to that, he was a Partner at Ernst\u00a0& Young LLP. Mr.\u00a0Lombardi is a Certified Public Accountant., 601380=For the table above, the amount of potential payments to the named executive officers in the event of the termination of their employment were calculated assuming that such terminations occurred on the last day of Fiscal 2011 (April 30, 2011). For the table above, the amount of potential payments to the named executive officers in the event of a termination of their employment in connection with a change of control were calculated assuming that a change of control occurred on the last day of Fiscal 2011, each named executive officer\u0092s employment terminated on that date due to involuntary termination or for good reason and the successor company did not assume the named executive officer\u0092s option and restricted stock awards., 203416=For Fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee set the amount payable upon the achievement of the performance target according to a sliding scale based on a designated percentage of base salary. The sliding scale provided for no incentive compensation payout if the Company achieved less than 84% of the target and for a maximum incentive compensation payout, as more fully described below, if the Company achieved 112% or more of the target., 546122=The calculation of the present value of accumulated benefit shown in the \u0093Pension Benefits\u0094 table assumes a discount rate of 6.0% and mortality under the RP-2000 Mortality Table with projections for May\u00a01, 2011., 263697=None of the members of the Compensation Committee has ever been an employee of the Company, and none of them had a relationship requiring disclosure in this Proxy Statement under Item\u00a0404 of SEC Regulation S-K. See \u0093Meetings and Committees of the Board\u0097Compensation Committee\u0094. None of the Company\u0092s executive officers serves, or in Fiscal 2011 served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of the Company\u0092s Board or the Company\u0092s Compensation Committee., 198243=decision to not make additional long-term equity-based grants so soon after these executives received significant equity-based grants in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010. For Mr.\u00a0DeFelice, however, compensation in Fiscal 2011 is skewed towards long-term equity-based awards as a result of his employment agreement.

Mr.\u00a0DeFelice was not previously an employee of the Company. The terms of the employment agreement with Mr.\u00a0Riggio commenced on May\u00a012, 2010. Mr.\u00a0Riggio\u0092s employment agreement will continue for a period of one year after its May\u00a012, 2010 effective date, and will renew each year automatically for one year unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to automatic renewal. Mr.\u00a0Riggio was not previously a party to an employment agreement., 264536=For purposes of the table below, the 2009 Transition Period is listed as \u00932009T\u0094., 624498=Each non-employee director is eligible for equity award grants under the Company\u0092s 2009 Incentive Plan. The table below illustrates the fair market value of the Fiscal 2011 restricted stock awards on the date of grant and the aggregate number of awards outstanding at fiscal year end for each non-employee director., 680665=The firm of BDO USA, LLP (\u0093BDO\u0094) has been selected as independent registered public accountants for the Company. The independent registered public accountants examine annual financial statements and provide other non-audit and tax-related services for the Company. The Company and the Audit Committee have considered whether the non-audit services provided by BDO are compatible with maintaining the independence of BDO in its audit of the Company and have determined that, because such services are not considered prohibited services under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, such services are compatible with maintaining the independence of BDO., 181612=Set forth below is a chart showing, for each named executive officer, the percentage of total compensation that each element of compensation comprised in Fiscal 2011. Percentages for some rows may not add to 100 percent due to rounding., 698867=stockholder proposals intended to be raised at the Meeting other than as described in this Proxy Statement. It is nonetheless possible that stockholders may seek to raise a proposal at the Meeting that is not described in this Proxy Statement by notifying the Company of such proposal in accordance with the Company\u0092s Bylaws. The business of the Meeting shall not include voting on any stockholder nominee or proposal if proper notice as to such nominee or proposal is not properly delivered to the Company on or before September\u00a028, 2011., 651483=In connection with the Acquisition, B&N College and the Company amended and restated B&N College\u0092s existing long-term supply agreement (Supply Agreement) with MBS Textbook Exchange, Inc. (MBS), which is majority owned by Leonard Riggio, Stephen Riggio (the Company\u0092s Vice Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer) and other members of the Riggio family. MBS is a new and used textbook wholesaler, which also sells textbooks online and provides bookstore systems and distant learning distribution services. Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, which has a term of ten years, and subject to availability and competitive terms and conditions, B&N College will continue to purchase new and used printed textbooks for a given academic term from MBS prior to buying them from other suppliers, other than in connection with student buy-back programs. MBS pays B&N College commissions based on the volume of textbooks sold to MBS each year and with respect to the textbook requirements of certain distance learning programs that MBS fulfills on B&N College\u0092s behalf. MBS paid B&N College $13,031,000 and $7,014,000 related to these commissions in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 from the date of Acquisition, respectively. In addition, the Supply Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit the ability of B&N College and the Company to become a used textbook wholesaler and that place certain limitations on MBS\u0092s business activities. B&N College and Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com also entered into an agreement with MBS in fiscal 2011 pursuant to which MBS agrees to purchase at the end of a given semester certain agreed upon textbooks which B&N College and Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com shall have rented to students during such semester. Total sales to MBS under this program were $506,000 for fiscal 2011. In addition, B&N College entered into an agreement with MBS in fiscal 2011 pursuant to which MBS purchases books from B&N College, which have no resale value for a flat rate per box. Total sales to MBS under this program were $427,000 for fiscal 2011., 202785=During the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee established a target level of consolidated EBITDA for Fiscal 2011 of $242.3 million. The consolidated EBITDA target, a Company-wide performance metric, was chosen to incentivize these named executive officers to work together to advance the Company\u0092s continuing efforts to integrate its operations as a multi-channel retailer in order to realize operational efficiencies and to provide a superior and seamless experience for customers., 73980=July 1993 to April 1998. During the previous five years, Ms.\u00a0Monaco also served as a director of Stage Stores, Inc. and the W.P. Stewart\u00a0& Co. Growth Fund., 199757=The Compensation Committee usually establishes base salaries of the named executive officers by the end of the first quarter of each fiscal year. However, as previously mentioned, new employment agreements setting forth minimum base salary levels were executed in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 for Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Lombardi, and Mr.\u00a0DeFelice\u0092s base salary was determined at the time his new employment agreement was executed in the second quarter of Fiscal 2011. For those reasons, the Compensation Committee decided not to change the base salaries for any of the named executive officers from the base salaries set forth in their employment agreements. In April 2010, Ms.\u00a0Keating received a modest base salary increase from $550,000 to $575,000 in connection with the Company\u0092s annual review of compensation., 701275=The Company\u0092s Annual Report for Fiscal 2011, including financial statements, is being sent to stockholders together with this Proxy Statement., 63290=Qualifications, Experience, Attributes and Skills. Mr.\u00a0Stephen Riggio has a total of more than 16 years of executive and board-level experience serving as a director of the Company, including serving as Vice Chairman since 1997, and as the former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Mr.\u00a0Stephen Riggio also has nearly 35 years of retail experience, which he gained over his long career at the Company. This experience allows Mr.\u00a0Stephen Riggio to bring to the Board a deep understanding of the Company itself and the retail industry more generally., 689493=The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the Company\u0092s Fiscal 2011 executive compensation programs align well with the Compensation Committee\u0092s philosophy and are sufficiently linked to the Company\u0092s performance., 432722=Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2011 Year End, 200884=In addition to a base salary, in Fiscal 2011, each of Messrs. Lynch, Lombardi, Klipper and Riggio was granted performance-based annual incentive compensation in the form of cash-settled performance units, payable in accordance with the Company\u0092s stockholder-approved 2009 Incentive Plan. The performance units grant, which vests over a one-year period, is designed to motivate individual and team performance in attaining the current year\u0092s performance goals and business objectives. Ms.\u00a0Keating participated in the Company\u0092s Incentive Compensation Plan for Home Office Management for Fiscal 2011. Mr.\u00a0DeFelice received annual incentive compensation for Fiscal 2011 pursuant to his employment agreement., 651028=The Company pays COBRA benefits for certain former employees and family members that were on the B&N College health benefit plan (prior to the Acquisition). Leonard Riggio has reimbursed the Company $140,000 to cover such costs, based upon standard COBRA rates, for the period subsequent to Acquisition through Fiscal 2010., 169458=Prior to Fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee retained Mercer (US) Inc. (\u0093Mercer\u0094) to advise on and analyze matters regarding executive compensation, including the compensation levels for Messrs. Lynch, Lombardi, Klipper and DeFelice in connection with such executives\u0092 promotions and employment agreements. The Compensation Committee decided to not engage Mercer for Fiscal 2011 because, in addition to providing compensation consulting services to the Compensation Committee, Mercer and a firm under common ownership with Mercer, Marsh, Inc., provided other services to the Company. In connection with completing its prior engagement, Mercer performed services related to the preparation of the Company\u0092s proxy statement relating to Fiscal 2010 compensation and some of these services were performed in Fiscal 2011., 174003=The Compensation Committee does not set percentile goals for its executive compensation relative to any peer group. The compensation of the named executive officers in Fiscal 2011 was heavily influenced by the terms and conditions of Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Lombardi\u0092s employment agreements, which were executed in the last quarter of Fiscal 2010, and Mr.\u00a0DeFelice\u0092s employment agreement, which was executed in the second quarter of Fiscal 2011. In determining the compensation provided in Mr.\u00a0Lynch\u0092s employment agreement, the Compensation Committee considered the market median of chief executive officer-level compensation in both the Retail Peer Group and the Technology Peer Group. With respect to Mr.\u00a0Lombardi\u0092s employment agreement, the Compensation Committee considered the market median chief financial officer-level compensation for companies in the Retail Peer Group. In determining the compensation provided in Mr.\u00a0Klipper\u0092s employment agreement, the Compensation Committee considered the market median compensation of both Retail Peer Group chief operating officers and the second highest paid executive in each Retail Peer Group company. While the Compensation Committee reviews peer group analysis to ensure that the compensation program is competitive and promotes retention, relative pay is an imperfect metric for the Company\u0092s compensation programs and, therefore, just one factor that the Compensation Committee considers in determining compensation levels. In addition, the Compensation Committee considers: (a)\u00a0the Company\u0092s business performance; (b)\u00a0each named executive officer\u0092s experience, prior performance and anticipated future performance; (c)\u00a0relative compensation among the named executive officers; (d)\u00a0industry-wide business conditions; and (e)\u00a0the recommendations of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, when considering the Retail Peer Group data, the Compensation Committee took into account the fact that Messrs. Lynch, Lombardi and DeFelice, Ms.\u00a0Keating and Mr.\u00a0Riggio had significant job responsibilities that were in addition to their roles in managing the Company\u0092s retail business., 104724=All Board members are expected to attend in person the Company\u0092s annual meetings of stockholders and be available to address questions or concerns raised by stockholders. All of the then-incumbent Directors attended the 2010 annual meeting of stockholders., 711788=The undersigned acknowledges receipt of the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the Proxy Statement, each dated September 14, 2011., 669443=The Company uses Digital on Demand as its provider of music and video database equipment and services. Leonard Riggio\u00a0owns a minority interest in Digital on Demand through the same investment company through which he owned a minority interest in Source Interlink. The Company paid Digital on Demand $1,932,000, $2,593,000, $1,960,000 and $4,893,000 for music and video database equipment and services during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, the transition period and fiscal 2008, respectively. This agreement was terminated on May\u00a031, 2011., 597447=This row represents the value of unvested restricted stock awards that would automatically vest upon a termination due to death, disability or termination following a change of control. With the exception of awards granted in connection with the March\u00a017, 2010 employment agreements for Messrs. Lynch, Lombardi and Klipper, the January\u00a06, 2009 employment agreement with Mr.\u00a0Lynch and the September\u00a027, 2010 employment agreement with Mr.\u00a0DeFelice, unvested shares of restricted stock are forfeited upon an involuntary termination, termination for \u0093cause\u0094 or termination for \u0093good reason\u0094. The awards granted under the employment agreements described in the preceding sentence would vest upon a termination of the named executive officer\u0092s employment by the Company without \u0093cause\u0094 or by the named executive officer for \u0093good reason\u0094, pursuant to such employment agreements. In addition, under the option award agreements executed pursuant to the Company\u0092s 2009 Incentive Plan, 687897=The recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u0093Dodd-Frank Act\u0094) enables the Company\u0092s stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory or non-binding basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules., 34848=The presence in person or by proxy at the Meeting of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock outstanding as of September\u00a012, 2011 will constitute a quorum., 660346=The Company has leases for two locations for its corporate offices with related parties: the first location is leased from an entity in which Leonard Riggio has a majority interest and expires in 2013; the second location is leased from an entity in which Leonard Riggio has a minority interest and expires in 2016. The space was rented at an aggregate annual rent including real estate taxes of approximately $4,868,000, $4,889,000, $1,198,000 and $4,681,000 during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, the transition period and fiscal 2008, respectively., 43279=The Board currently consists of eleven Directors. Nine of the Directors are divided into three classes, currently consisting of three members whose terms expire upon the election and qualification of their successors at the Meeting, three members whose terms expire at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders and three members whose terms expire at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders. Two Directors are to be elected solely by the holders of Series J Preferred Stock (currently, Liberty GIC, Inc. (\u0093Liberty\u0094)), voting as a separate class. These two Directors will be elected by Liberty following the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. At such time as Liberty and its affiliates hold at least 76,500 but less than 127,500 shares of Series J Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series J Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect only one Director. At such time as Liberty and its affiliates hold less than 76,500 shares of Series J Preferred Stock, then the holders of the Series J Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall cease to have the right to elect Directors. In accordance with the Company\u0092s Bylaws, the Board reduced its size from eleven to ten Directors with no vacancies effective immediately before the Meeting, with such reduction being in the class of Directors with terms expiring upon the election and qualification of their successors at the Meeting. The Board unanimously recommends using the enclosed white proxy card to vote FOR each of the Board\u0092s two nominees for Director., 225310=Set forth below is a chart showing target and maximum annual performance-based incentive compensation for the named executive officers for Fiscal 2011. For Fiscal 2011, the Company\u0092s consolidated EBITDA was $163.4 million, which was less than the minimum performance level of 84% of the $242.3 million target consolidated EBITDA. Accordingly, the named executive officers, other than Mr.\u00a0DeFelice, did not receive performance-based annual incentive compensation for Fiscal 2011., 432146=Each non-equity incentive plan award and equity-based award reported in the \u0093Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2011\u0094 table was granted under the Company\u0092s stockholder-approved 2009 Executive Performance Plan. See \u0093Performance-Based Annual Incentive Compensation\u0094 in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis on page 23 of this Proxy Statement and \u0093Long-Term Equity\u0094 in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis on page 26 of this Proxy Statement., 196849=The relative mix of compensation among these elements is designed to strike a balance between rewarding annual performance in a competitive marketplace and aligning the long-term interests of the Company\u0092s named executive officers with those of the Company\u0092s stockholders. As we noted in our proxy statement for Fiscal 2010, the relative mix of Fiscal 2010 compensation for Messrs. Lynch, Lombardi and Klipper was significantly skewed toward long-term equity-based awards as a result of the Committee\u0092s decision to make one-time, equity-based grants in connection with the promotions of Messrs. Lynch and Klipper and the execution of Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Lombardi\u0092s new employment agreements. As a result, for Fiscal 2011, the relative mix of compensation for these executives was significantly skewed toward base salary, performance-based annual incentive compensation and discretionary bonuses as a result of the Compensation Committee\u0092s, 70847=Irene R.
