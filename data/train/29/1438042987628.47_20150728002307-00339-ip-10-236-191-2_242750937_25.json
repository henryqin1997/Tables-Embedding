L. 104\u2013324, title VI, \u00a7602(a), Oct. 19, 1996, 110 Stat. 3928.), 479338=The history of Federal authority to carry out a tank vessel safety program begins with the enactment of the so-called Tank Vessel Act of 1936 which, as amended, is presently codified in section 391a of title 46, United States Code. The 1936 Act remained essentially the same until it was amended by the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972. The 1972 amendment contained more specific standards for the protection of a tank vessel and its crew and added vessel standards to improve the quality of the marine environment. After a rash of tank vessel accidents during the latter part of 1976 and early 1977 within our territorial seas and in nearby coastal waters, there was an outpouring of public attention to the need to protect United States ports and waterways, for the safety of tank vessels, and for the protection of the marine environment. This led to the enactment of the Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978, which provided broader and more extensive regulatory authority over areas already regulated and over many areas not previously regulated. It provided for improvements in the supervision and control of vessels of all types operating in the navigable waters of the United States, and in the safety of all tank vessels, foreign or domestic, that transport or transfer oil or hazardous cargoes in ports or places subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The 1978 amendments also reflect, in part, certain tank vessel standards and requirements that have been accepted internationally, in particular those developed by the International Conference on Tanker Safety and Pollution Prevention held in London in February, 1978., 763480=Section 5101 contains definitions that are limited to Chapter 51\u2014Load Lines. Existing Section 46 App. U.S.C. 86a (which defines only the terms \u201cnew ship\u201d and \u201cexisting ship\u201d) will be replaced by section 5101. Definitions of technical terms (\u201cfreeboard\u201d, \u201cfreeboard deck\u201d, and \u201cminimum safe freeboard\u201d) have been added for clarity. The definition of the term \u201cnew ship\u201d has been deleted because the term is not used in Chapter 51. The definition of \u201cdomestic voyage\u201d includes the phrase \u201cplaces in or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d \u201cPlaces subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d include deep water ports, production platforms, mining sites outside of territorial waters of the United States but within the United States\u2019 Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that was established by Presidential Proclamation 5030, dated March 10, 1983, or on the outer continental shelf. The phrases \u201ceconomic benefit of overloading\u201d and \u201cweight of the overload\u201d have been defined for purposes of establishing a standard method of determining the value of the cargo with which a vessel is overloaded. The value of the cargo will in turn affect the maximum penalty assessed for overloading the vessel. The definition of \u201cfreeboard deck\u201d provides the Secretary with the authority to designate as the freeboard deck either the actual deck (on standard vessels) or another structure (on non-standard vessels). Non-standard vessels, for which this regulatory flexibility is necessary, include shelter deck vessels, semi-submersible multi-hull units, container ships, surface effect vessels, and commercial submarines., 906725=For provisions that a certificate of registry issued before Aug. 18, 1990, terminates on the day it would have expired if the amendment to this section by Pub.
