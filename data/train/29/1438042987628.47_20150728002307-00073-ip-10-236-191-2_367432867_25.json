Customizing the behavior of VRRP is optional. Be aware that as soon as you enable a VRRP group, that group is operating. It is possible that if you first enable a VRRP group before customizing VRRP, the router could take over control of the group and become the master virtual router before you have",
    "textAfterTable": "When a VRRP packet arrives from another router in the VRRP group, its authentication string is compared to the string configured on the local system. If the strings match, the message is accepted. If they do not match, the packet is discarded. All routers within the group must be configured with the same authentication string. To disable VRRP authentication, use the no command. Note\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plain text authentication is not meant to be used for security.
