Accountable supply distribution and storage activities use this form as a source document to adjust item and financial records for supply management purposes., 259461=a. Local purchase of some nonstandard, nonstocked items is authorized without referral to the wholesale supply source or end item manager. The items below may automatically be purchased locally under this provision. Preparation of DA Form 1988, as cited in AR 708-1 , is not required. When an Army wholesale supply source receives three demands (advice code 2A requisitions) in 180 days for these items, a determination will be made at that time as to whether they should be centrally managed., 449381=e. The SICA will be billed for the full amount on the requisition. This occurs even though the A0_ is to replace an unserviceable (condition code E or F) ARI \"N\" or \"M\" item (for which an FTA was previously sent). Proper credit will be granted to the SICA upon PICA receipt of the unserviceable carcass with project code 3AL in the FTA and shipping document ( DD 1348-1 ). Project code 3AL is not needed on the replacement requisition., 253547=(g) Ammunition items processed per TB 9-1300-256 .

Non-AMDF NSN requisitions . The Army end item manager will keep demand data on non-Army AMDF (non-Army interest) NSN items or get this information from the wholesaler. Demands included in DA Forms 1988 and those filled at the NICP level will be used to determine if the item qualifies for Army interest., 29877=(d) From 1 Jul 91 to unknown . Request for resources to eliminate the reason for this constraint was submitted to (approving authority) on (date). (Identify correspondence on the request.), 350324=d. An MOV request is generated from a supply source to a requisitioner/control office for a comparison and validation of the continued requirement of outstanding requisitions held as materiel obligations by the supply source for all items except major end items. This also applies to long production lead time items (including PA-2 items), effective January 91 (see para 4-24b )., 490284=(1) If the DD Form 1348-1 or DD Form 1348-1Automated has not been printed, modify the original MRO data elements as appropriate. This will be done by matching the document number and suffix of each modifier with the document number and suffix of the original MRO. The SA will continue to process the MRO as modified., 501113=(2) Prepare a materiel release denial (MRD) (DD Form 1348M) to show the quantity denied.

This input will be received by transceiver, electrical media other than transceiver, administrative electrical message, telephone, radio, or mail. (Input received by administrative electrical message, telephone, or radio will not be confirmed.) Requisitions may be received from non-DOD activities authorized to order on DA supply sources by mail, electrical message, telephone, radio, or by SF 344. The format may be peculiar to the requisitioning activity. Supply sources receiving orders by telephone will record the data on DD Form 1348, DD Form 1348M, or DD Form 1348-6., 951290=b. The LIM will decrease the inventory control record using DIC D9E (decrease-logistic transfer) or DIC D9F (decrease-decapitalization). The decrease will be through the use of the DD Form 1487 prepared as outlined in paragraph E-251 ( table E-269 )., 313705=e. Other media for PD 09-15 documents. Use airmail, regular mail, or courier. The document used may be a interpreted DD Form 1348M , DD Form 1348-1 for MRO actions, or manually prepared DD Form 1348 or DD Form 1348-6 . Mechanically prepared and interpreted documents should be used as much as possible. Requisitions and related correspondence to and from oversea requisitioners for delivery through postal channels will be airmailed., 482827=b. A consolidated report of validation of materiel obligations will be submitted quarterly in accordance with the time frames shown in table 4-2 . The report will be assigned Reports Control Symbol DD-P&L(Q) 1064. See table 4-3 for format., 884462=a. The DD Form 1487 (DOD Materiel Adjustment Document) is used as either a single or dual transaction document., 307483=h. Requisitions for newly negotiated items will be submitted as soon as possible. Requisitions will reflect the first day of the month of consumption in the RDD, rp 62-64 (e.g., 001 for Jan; 032 for Feb, etc.). This enables the MSCs to determine the correct month for which the requisition has been submitted., 15491=f. DD Form 1348-6 (DOD Single Line Item Requisition System Document (Manual Long-Form)). This form will be used to requisition non-NSN requirements that exceed the stock or part number field when other information is needed to help in making supply decisions. (See para B-9 ( fig B-13 ).), 636850=c. Entries in the DD Form 1348-1 or DD Form 1348-1 Automated for return of materiel to supply sources are in appendix B and tables B-2 and B-6. In addition for intra-Army use, the following entries will also be completed: suffix code, supplementary address, signal code, fund code, distribution code, project code, and return advice code., 267119=(a) Demands included in DA Forms 1988, and those filled at the NICP level, will be used to determine if the item qualifies for the above actions., 29431=(a) From 1 Aug 91 to 1 Oct 91 .

When the SA records reflect cancellation or denial prior to receipt of the MRO modifier, the SA will respond with an AG6 reply to cancellation request or supply status AE6 with status code BY., 14763=e. DD Form 1348-5 (Notice of Availability/Shipment). This form is used as a \ufffd, 576489=d. Regardless of dollar value or quantity, the DIC AC_ cancellation request will be processed promptly to cancel quantities for which MROs, DD Form 1348-1 or DD Form 1348-1 Automated, and purchase requests have not been prepared., 4003=* Changes blocks N and R of the DD Form 1348-1 from optional entries to mandatory entries to force the entry of the controlled inventory item code in block N and the shelf life code in block R ( para B-3 ; table B-1 )., 634203=c. When disposition instructions divert the return to the original distribution system, provide the returning activity with information for preparing DD Form 1348-1 or DD Form 1348-1 Automated ( para 4-81 ). This will include the activity to be credited, if it applies, fund code, type of return, and management data, as needed., 506328=a. General . The DD Form 1348-1 (DOD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document), or the DD Form 1348-1Automated (DOD Issue Release/Receipt Document), and the optional Automated Packing List (APL) are prepared by the supply or shipping activity. A DD Form 1348-1Automated is prepared for each MRO, or for each bill of lading if partial shipments are involved. These documents are used for selecting, packing, shipping, and receiving materiel. They are also used as a record of receipt transaction and as the source document for preparation of other documents., 300415=(1) Trainers and flight simulators-through channels to the Cdr, AMC, Alexandria, VA 22333-0001., 119983=(2) RADs are expressed in months in rp 63-64, preceded by an \"A\" in rp 62. The actual date of materiel availability will be the last day of the cited month.

Requests for non-AMDF NSN items will always be submitted on DD Form 1348-6., 245741=(3) DIC A0B/A02 requests will have the identification code in rp 70 and the data entry in rp 71-80. DIC A0E/A05 will have the data entry in the proper block of DD Form 1348-6 . This reference data should not preclude a part-numbered request from going DIC A0B/ A02. For example, if the publication number cannot be accommodated in rp 71-80, try the end item model or serial number, and so forth., 922847=(d) Because of the DIC DAC and DIC A5J, the SA will prepare the disposal turn-in document (DTID) ( DD Form 1348-1 or DD Form 1348-1 Automated) ( app B ). It must accompany the item to the DRMO. Where there is no off depot movement or the materiel is to remain in place, the DRMO will sign for the materiel on the DD Form 1348-1 or DD Form 1348-1 Automated., 439867=MWO requirements normally will be received on DD Form 1348 , DD Form 1348M , or DD Form 1348-6 , with DIC A05 or DIC A0E (showing inclusion of written exception data). They will be processed as follows:, 297640=b. Small arms generally are in one of the following FSCs: 1005 , 1010 , 1015 , 1025 , 1040 , 1055 , 1090 , and 1095 . However, this list is not all-inclusive. Any weapon meeting the general guidelines of a small arms weapon will be treated accordingly, regardless of the FSC., 632768=a. Partially completed materiel receipt documents ( DD Form 1486 ) will be furnished each depot to receive stock from a specific procurement., 118275=(5) The RDD for Aviation Intensive Management Items (AIMI) will be the first day of the month of consumption (e.g., 001 for Jan; 032 for Feb, etc.)., 250103=d. DA Form 1988 (Request for Review of an Item) ., 224605=(2) Date of the requisition . A 4-position, numeric code that represents the date the requisition was sent to the initial supply source. The first digit shows the last numeric digit of the calendar year and the last three digits the numeric consecutive day (e.g., 9 July 1973 would be \"3190\"). See figure 3-7 for numerical calendar., 834414=(b) When materiel is found to be defective upon initial receipt, each copy of the QDR will be accompanied by copies of the applicable wholesale receipt documentation (DD Form 1348-1A for nonprocurement shipments; DD Form 250 or procurement delivery document for deliveries from procurement) and the materiel receipt transaction (DIC D4_ or D6_). The materiel receipt document will contain management Code L ( para C-35 (tables C-52 through C-57 )) to identify receipt of a deficient item., 203944=The manual and mechanical single line item requisition documents (DD Forms 1348 , 1348M , and 1348-6 ) are composed of four elements., 195711=DD Form 1348 , DD Form 1348M , and DD Form 1348-6 are the three basic forms used for requisitioning, follow-up, and cancellation. DD Form 1348-1 is the preferred form when requesting property directly from Defense Reutilization and Marketing Offices (DRMOs)., 346401=a. Single line item cancellations will be prepared, other than cyclic, in accordance with paragraph E-12 ( table E-12 ), using DD Form 1348 or 1348M . Cancellation will be sent to the same points and under the same criteria as for follow-ups. Single line cancellations on exception data requisitions will not include the exception data., 487213=(2) Remote storage and shipping activities will receive and use only MRO transactions DD Form 1348M . These transactions will be received from the supply sources by transceiver or mail. (When materiel is released from commercial storage installations, or oversea remote storage points with no machine capability, DD Form 1348-1 or DD Form 1348-1A may also be furnished.) See appendix B for format instructions., 795836=a. Due-in transactions ( DD Forms 1486 ), DIC DD_ or DF_ paragraph E-257 ( table E-275 ), and paragraph E-258 ( table E-276 )., 377748=b. Supply documents are identified by the DIC in block 1, DD Form 1348 ; in rp 1-3, DD Form 1348M ; in the first three blocks of DD Form 1348-6 ; or in block 1, SF 344 . The supply documents below may be processed by the supply source:, 368749=Installations or activities will use the uniform Disposal Release Order ( DD Form 1348-1 ) ( para B-3 ( fig B-3 )) to document turn-in or shipments to DRMO. Use of this form and the data are mandatory, (see chapter 8 for instructions)., 842140=f. The U.S. Army Troop Support Agency, ATTN: DALO-TAB-B, Fort Lee, VA, is the contact point for subsistence. Subsistence discrepancies are reported on DD Form 1608 , (Unsatisfactory Materiel Report (Subsistence)). Troop Issue Subsistence Activities (TISA) operating under AR 30-18 will submit DA Form 1608 in accordance with AR 30-16., 790927=c. Wholesale activity receipt processing effectiveness will be reported in the Report of Inventory Control Effectiveness, Reports Control Symbol (RCS) CSGLD-1870, in accordance with AR 740-26 . The acceptable DA performance goals for receipt processing are: the percent posted within the time standard-90 percent; and, percent stored within the time standard-90 percent. Include in overall performance against these time standards those receipts frustrated for a long time before posting or storing., 789265=(3) Time frames for processing receipts from tailgate off-loading until the AA receives the materiel receipt document ( DD Form 1486 ) is shown in table 5-1 ., 232430=b. The fund code will be entered in block 17 of the manual requisition ( DD Form 1348 ), or in rp 52-53 of the mechanical requisition ( DD Form 1348M )., 799183=a. Consignment of materiel to receiving activities will be either by DD Form 1348-1 , DD Form 1348-1 Automated, or an authorized procurement delivery document, DD Form 250 (FAR and APP). These forms will be used, together with information gathered in inspection and classification procedures, as source data to document materiel receipt transactions in this section., 636446=b. The same document ( DD Form 1348-1 or DD Form 1348-1 Automated) prepared in the number of copies stated in section III , this chapter, will be used for these transactions., 13730=d. DD Form 1348-1 (DOD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document). This form is used as a \ufffd, 517971=d. On receipt of a DIC AC6, the SA will determine the proper work areas to which stop shipment notices would be sent when cancellation of an in-process DD Form 1348-1, DD Form 1348-1Automated, or shipment is required. The stop shipment notices will include pertinent line item and document identification priority. It will also contain information as to whether a single or multiline shipment unit is involved. A separate stop shipment notice will be issued to the current work area and each other work area through which the shipment would be processed., 411165=(3) Purpose codes J, N, and P . This materiel will not be issued for other than FMS, Supply Support Arrangements (SSA), or Grant Aid (GA) requirements without prior written approval from Commander, AMC, ATTN: AMCDS, 5001 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22333-0001., 254056=(4) SSAs always have the option of using the DD Form 1988 to request assignment of an NSN. For example, the form may be used to request an NSN for an item needed to meet a contingency requirement, or as a means to follow-up to an MRC regarding demands previously submitted to the MRC., 522630=(8) There are cases when a shipment could not be stopped or diverted. Sometimes the SA did not stop or divert a shipment with the DTS due to one of the reasons in ( 6 ) above. Also, the SA may get notice that the DTS did not stop or divert the shipment as requested. In these cases, the SA will send a reply to cancellation request-materiel release confirmation (DIC AU0, A, B) to the SOS; the SOS is shown on the MRO. DIC AU0 shows the exact quantity on the MRO, DD Form 1348-1 , DD Form 1348-1Automated was shipped and not canceled. DIC AUA shows that a quantity greater than on the MRO or DD 1348-1 was shipped and not canceled. (This greater quantity was due to unit pack.) DIC AUB shows that a quantity less than on the MRO or DD Form 1348-1 was shipped and not canceled. (This lesser quantity is also due to unit pack.) Upon receipt of the AU0, A, B, the SOS will create a reply to cancellation request-shipment status (DIC AU8) to DAAS. DAAS will convert the AU8 to the appropriate DIC AU1, 2, or 3 transaction. DAAS will then provide the status to eligible recipients as determined from the original MRO., 832027=(1) Customer receipt of materiel from DCSC COPAD will be accompanied by copies one and four of DCSC Form 1938., 639380=c. Entries in the DD Form 1348-1 or DD Form 1348-1 Automated for return of discrepant FMS materiel are in appendix B and tables B-4 and B-8 ., 817094=When 45 calendar days have passed since the shipping date shown in the shipment notice, posted to the due-in file, and the receipt has not been reported to the AA, the AA will initiate follow-up. Extension of the 45 calendar days time frame is authorized when long transit times are involved. Follow-up will be by sending materiel receipt follow-up transactions to the storage activities. The follow-up documents will be prepared on DD Form 1486 or tape depending on system concept. Follow-ups on expected receipts from procurement instrument sources will be identified by DIC DXA and prepared in the format as prescribed in paragraph E-275 ( table E-293 ). Follow-ups on expected receipts from other than procurement instrument sources will be identified by DIC DXB and prepared as prescribed in paragraph E-276 ( table E-294 )., 241190=(1) DA Form 2765 (Request for Issue or Turn-In) ( DA Pam 710-2-1 ). All materiel requests for items having an NSN in the AMDF will use DA Form 2765 (Mechanized or Manual). It will also be used for a part-numbered request if the supply support activity (SSA) has provided a prepunched document for that item., 813358=(2) Advance copies of DD Forms 1348-1 , DD Forms 1348-1 Automated, DD Forms 1149 (Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document), DD Forms 1155 , DD Forms 250 , or other shipping documents., 961212=a. The GIM will convert the DIC DEE or DIC DEF transaction received from the LIM to DIC D8E (increase-logistic transfer) or D8F (increase-capitalization). This establishes or increases the inventory balances. (This is not required on receipt of a DEE/DEF with a zero balance.) This will be done through use of the DD Form 1487 prepared according to paragraph E-251 ( table E-269 ). The GIM may automatically reject invalid DIC DEE or DEF transactions using DIC DZG transaction rejects (See para E-287 ( table E-305 )). Telephone communication between the GIM and LIM is authorized to resolve DIC DEE or DEF transactions that reject from the validation process., 611789=a. Supply sources will cancel requisitions dated on or before the effective date announced in mass or universal cancellation requests for which MROs, DD Forms 1348-1 or 1348-1 Automated, or purchase requests have not been sent to storage or procurement activities. Cancellations will be confirmed by supply status (DIC AE_), supply status code BQ or B4, to all recipients of status ( para 4-60 ) within the timeframes in paragraph 4-61 ., 196482=a. Requisitioners who do not have EAM systems, ADP capabilities, or Mode V teletype will use DD Form 1348 (see table 3-1 ). Entries on this form will be typed or legibly printed. The manual requisition form can be either a 4-part or 6-part paper stock, EAM size, single-line document., 29567=(b) From 1 Sep 91 to 1 Oct 91 . Personnel will become available on 1 Oct 91., 924854=(d) Besides the DIC DAC and the DIC A5_, for the normal release receipt document the SA will prepare and send DD Form 1348-1 ( para B-3 ) or DD Form 1348-1 Automated ( para B-4 ))., 262368=(15) Repair parts costing $1000 or less for closed circuit television networks., 294895=d. Requisitions may also be handcarried to the DRMO for local issue of materiel. These requisitions will be prepared on a DD Form 1348-1 ; or DD Form 1348-1A ( para B-4b . DRMO processing of these requisitions will be performed as stated in paragraph 8-18 ., 94108=d. This system implies that special handling and high-speed transportation will normally be used to meet the needs of the operating forces for PDs 01-08. However, the Deputy Secretary of Defense approved a change in 1987 to reduce the amount of premium transportation dollars to be spent for PD 01-08 requisition shipments. The change requires that PD 01-08 requisitions that do not contain a valid required delivery date (RDD)/required availability date (RAD) entry (e.g., 999, 555, N, or E in rp 62) or a JCS project code, be processed by routine distribution and transportation standards (PD 09-15 standards). To assist commanders when a valid RDD/RAD or JCS project code does not apply, and expedited transportation is required to meet mission needs, the change established a new Expedited Transportation Signal designator of \"777.\" Army operating elements will use \"777\" in PD 01-08 requisitions only to support operational reconstitution's (see FM 100-16 ). This change only affects the storage and transportation processing segments. Materiel allocation and NICP processing will remain the same for the PD indicated in the requisition. For routine handling, cost-favorable transportation will be used generally to move materiel with PDs 09-15. During emergencies the time standards and mode prescribed may be temporarily changed by OASD (P&L)., 18257=i. DA Form 2510 (Storage Item Data Change Document). Accountable supply distribution activities use this form to provide technical data to a storage point., 510167=(2) The APL will contain at a minimum the prescribed data elements listed in paragraph B-5 . When the APL is not produced, a copy of the DD Form 1348-1Automated will be used and will be placed inside the packing list envelope securely attached to the outside of the shipping container.
