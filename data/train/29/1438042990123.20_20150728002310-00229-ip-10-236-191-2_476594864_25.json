Furthermore, testing by an independent testing laboratory by pyrolysis mass spectrometry indicates that lotek\ufffd 7520 resins are generally zinc salts of a terpolymer of ethylene, acrylic acid, and methyl acrylate., 16777=This application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser.

In addition, for comparison purposes, Surlyn\ufffd 1855 (new Surlyn\ufffd 9020), the cover composition of the '193 patent, was molded about the inner layer of composition D (the intermediate ball representative of the '193 patent). The outer layer TE-90 was molded to a thickness of approximately 0.030 inches to produce a golf ball of approximately 1.680 inches in diameter. The resulting balls (a dozen balls for each example) were tested and the various properties thereof are set forth in Table 6A as follows:, 23050=In the '193 patent, a multi-layer golf ball is produced by initially molding a first cover layer on a spherical core and then adding a second layer. The first layer is comprised of a hard, high flexural modulus resinous material such as type 1605 Surlyn\ufffd (now designated Surlyn\ufffd 8940). Type 1605 Surlyn\ufffd (Surlyn\ufffd 8940) is a sodium ion based low acid (less than or equal to 15 weight percent methacrylic acid) ionomer resin having a flexural modulus of about 51,000 psi. An outer layer of a comparatively soft, low flexural modulus resinous material such as type 1855 Surlyn\ufffd (now designated Surlyn\ufffd 9020) is molded over the inner cover layer. Type 1855 Surlyn\ufffd (Surlyn\ufffd 9020) is a zinc ion based low acid (10 weight percent methacrylic acid) ionomer resin having a flexural modulus of about 14,000 psi., 123787=Shore hardness was measured generally in accordance with ASTM test 2240., 38511=Preferably, the outer layer includes a blend of hard and soft (low acid) ionomer resins such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,884,814 and 5,120,791, both incorporated herein by reference. Specifically, a desirable material for use in molding the outer layer comprises a blend of a high modulus (hard), low acid, ionomer with a low modulus (soft) low acid, ionomer to form a base ionomer mixture. A high modulus ionomer herein is one which measures from about 15,000 to about 70,000 psi as measured in accordance with ASTM method D-790. The hardness may be defined as at least 50 on the Shore D scale as measured in accordance with ASTM method D-2240.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description. It is intended that the invention, be construed as including all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. Test results indicate that a very good multi-layer ball can be made using castable polyurethane cover material. Further, advantages include the molding of very thin covers, molding over very soft compression core/mantle, and low cost tooling. Table 9 contains the construction details and test results. Multilayer balls with the thermoset urethane covers (Examples 23-25) were softer in compression and similar in COR to the multi-layer balls with the Z-Balata cover (Examples 27-29). Shore C was much lower for the urethane balls and they were more resistant to scuff than any of the Z-Balata covered balls. Guillotine cut resistance was about the same. Spin rate comparison shows that the urethane samples are better than the Z-Balata covered balls. (1-good, 4-poor) 3 3 3 2 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Scuff (1-good, 4-poor) 2 2 2 2 1.5 2",
