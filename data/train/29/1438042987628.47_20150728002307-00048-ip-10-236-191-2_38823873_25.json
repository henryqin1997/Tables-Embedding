The algorithm for computing spherical harmonics is recursive and stable, and can reasonably defended as being fast, considering what it does. However, you should be aware that there is a numerical penalty to be paid for allowing a mask to have arbitrary shape: the computation time for harmonics up to l increases as l3, a pretty steep penalty when l is large. The computation time is proportional to the number of edges of the mask, and on my laptop (a 750MHz Pentium III), it takes 3 cpu minutes per edge to compute harmonics up to l\u00a0=\u00a01000.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "You do not need to resolve your mask into polygons: mangle will do that for you with the balkanize command. Typically, a mask is defined by boundaries of plates or fields or cuts in declination or galatic latitude, and by holes drilled in those plates or fields to avoid bright stars, satellite trails, and such. To start using mangle, you must first define your mask. A description of a mask is contained in `polygon files', which may take a variety of formats. For example, the masks of the 2dF survey are defined by 3 polygon files which define the boundaries of: (1) UKST plates, (2) 2\ufffd fields, (3) holes in UKST plates. 3. How do I use mangle?
