Normally occurring 2 to 3 times a month, each event lasts about one to two days. The winds can be strong enough to close the port so that ships can neither enter nor leave the inner harbor until the winds abate. The winds are usually reliably forecast 24 hours in advance of onset by Turkish marine forecasters at Incirlik Air Base near Adana. Local authorities state that berths 3, 4 and 5 are known to be susceptible to swell during periods of strong southwest wind conditions, and should be avoided during such periods.

WASTE OIL DISPOSAL: service is available., 60850=ISKENDERUN BAY. 36 37' N 036 07' E Iskenderun Bay is located on the North-East end of the Eastern Mediterranean, accommodating governmental and private berths and installations. Due to their geographical proximity, these facilities include oil terminals and dry cargo ports, also serving as gateways to the Middle Eastern countries. A number of these ports and jetties were built to serve specific purposes, such as importing minerals, ores, fertilizers, and scrap and exporting iron and steel oil exports piped from Iraq and probably from Middle Asia in the near future. Iskenderun bay is now busy commercial centers and an important ports of Turkey. FORECAST: port officials at Iskenderun state that there are two weather scenarios that pose the greatest threat to operations at the port. The first, and most hazardous, is a southeasterly wind locally called \"Yarikkaya\". The winds funnel though the valley that intersects the Nur Mountains southeast of the port. The southeast winds occasionally reach 64 kt or greater. During an average year, the wind will occur about seven times during the September to April period. The effect of the strong wind is to cause ships in the anchorage to drag anchor and, in some cases, even part the anchor chain. Ships in the inner harbor must be carefully secured during such events, using tugs if necessary to keep ships at their berths. It is suggested that ships in the anchorage move southwestward about 10 nmi to a location away from the funneling and better sheltered from the strong southeasterly winds. Areas closer to shore offer better protection than those farther out. Small boating is usually canceled during Yorikkaya events. The southeasterly winds also affect the NATO fuel pier located about 3.5 nmi north of the main port. During one event, a ship securely moored to the pier was in danger of pulling the pier down as the ship was forced away from its moorings. Two tugs were required to restrain the ship before it was feasible to move it to a safe anchorage. The second most trouble some phenomenon is a northerly wind which can reach 40 to 50 kt, and be accompanied by 6.5 to 10 ft swell at the anchorage. The effect is also felt at pier 1, because it is exposed to northerly winds and waves that pass through the harbor entrance. Ships moored to pier 1 are moved in order to avoid potential damage resulting from being forced onto the pier. According to port authorities, shelter from the northerly winds can be found across the bay about 5 nmi east of Yumurtalik. Forecasts of these and other meteorological events are broadcast in Turkish on VHF channels 16 and 67 and updated every three hours. . (You can receive the broadcast in English on VHF if you required) PILOTAGE : is compulsory for vessels entering or leaving the ports. , Call Pilots on VHF channels 16, or their self channels three hours before arrival at the ports.
