Any changes to the template automatically update the service profiles created from the template. Updating template Service profiles created from an initial template inherit all the properties of the template. However, after you create the profile, it is no longer connected to the template. If you need to make changes to one or more profiles created from this template, you must change each profile individually. Initial template Cisco UCS supports the following types of service profile templates: For example, if you need several service profiles with similar values to configure servers to host database software, you can create a service profile template, either manually or from an existing service profile. You then use the template to create the service profiles. If you need only one service profile with similar values to an existing service profile, you can clone a service profile in the Cisco UCS Manager GUI. Tip With a service profile",
