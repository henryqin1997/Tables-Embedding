When a Catalyst 6500 series switch is connected to a Catalyst 5500 ATM module, you must enter both keywords., 21550=The following example creates a static ARP entry that maps the IP address 172.20.173.28 to the SMDS address C141.5797.1313 on interface serial 0:, 416341=Enhanced QoS features were added for Cisco 1720, Cisco 1750, Cisco 1751, Cisco 1760, Cisco 2610XM-2651XM, Cisco 3640, Cisco 3640A, and Cisco 3660., 116521=To enable RFC 1483 ATM bridging or RFC 1490 Frame Relay bridging to map a bridged VLAN to an ATM permanent virtual circuit (PVC) or Frame Relay data-link connection identifier (DLCI), use the bridge-domaincommand in Frame Relay DLCI configuration, interface configuration, interface ATM VC configuration, or PVC range configuration mode. To disable bridging, use the no form of this command., 151869=The Cisco ASR 1000 device does not support MAC tunnels., 132237=Without the ignore-bpdu-pidkeyword, in strict mode, IEEE BPDUs are sent out using a PID of 0x00-0E, which complies with RFC 1483., 136470=RFC 1483 bridging is supported on AAL5-MUX and AAL5-LLC Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) encapsulated PVCs. RFC-1483 bridged PVCs must terminate on the ATM interface, and the bridged traffic must be forwarded over an Ethernet interface, unless the split-horizon option is used, which allows bridging of traffic across bridged PVCs., 412863=Frame Relay data-link connection identifier (DLCI) in the range from 16 to 1007., 416729=This feature was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.3(2)T for the following platforms: Cisco 1720, Cisco 1721, Cisco 1750, Cisco 1751, Cisco 1760, Cisco 2610-2651, Cisco 2610XM-2651XM, Cisco 2691, Cisco 3620, Cisco 3640, Cisco 3640A, and Cisco 3660., 124349=(Optional) Enables RFC 1483 split horizon mode to globally prevent bridging between PVCs in the same VLAN., 25985=Specifies the quota threshold, in megabytes (MB), for async write to perform the optimization. The default quote threshold is 20.

When the router connects to a device that is fully compliant with RFC 1483 Appendix B, in which the IEEE BPDUs are sent and received by the other device using a PID of 0x00-0E, you must not use the ignore-bpdu-pidkeyword., 354384=XOT connections are sent to TCP port 1998, so XOT connections originated by the router will have that remote port number, and connections received by the router will have that local port number., 138829=The ignore-bpdu-pid keyword is not used because the device operates in an RFC 1483-compliant topology for IEEE BPDUs., 130913=RFC 1483 bridging on ATM interfaces supports the point-to-point bridging of Layer 2 packet data units (PDUs) over Ethernet networks. RFC 1490 Frame Relay bridging on Packet over SONET (POS) or serial interfaces that are configured for Frame Relay encapsulation provides bridging of Frame Relay packets over Ethernet networks., 138446=The following example shows how to enable BPDU translation when a Catalyst 6500 series switch is connected to a device that understands only IEEE BPDUs in an RFC 1483-compliant topology:, 229545=(Optional) Specifies RFC 1490 encapsulation. The default is Cisco encapsulation., 131640=If you do not enter the ignore-bpdu-pid keyword, the PVC between the devices operates in compliance with RFC 1483 Appendix B. This is referred to as strict mode . Entering the ignore-bpdu-pid keyword creates loose mode . Both modes are described as follows:, 137229=RFC 1483 bridging is not supported for switched virtual circuits (SVCs). It also cannot be configured for PVCs on the main interface., 427702=Specifies the Frame Relay data-link connection identifier (DLCI) in the range 16 to 1007., 134482=The bridge-domainand bre-connect commands are mutually exclusive. You cannot use both commands on the same PVC for concurrent RFC 1483 and BRE bridging.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Usage Guidelines To use the accelerator command, enter parameter map configuration mode by using the parameter-map type waas command. The accelerator cifs-express command enters WAAS CIFS configuration mode, the accelerator http-express command enters WAAS HTTP configuration mode, and the accelerator ssl-express command enters WAAS SSL configuration mode. After entering a WAAS Express accelerator configuration mode, you can enable the respective accelerator by using the enable command. If an accelerator is not enabled, accelerator-specific parameters do not come into effect even if they are configured. Configure the accelerator-specific parameters after entering the respective WAAS Express accelerator configuration mode. Use the no form of the enable command to disable an accelerator. Use the exit command to exit a specific WAAS Express accelerator configuration mode. Examples The following example shows how to enter WAAS CIFS configuration mode and enable CIFS-Express accelerator: Device(config)# parameter-map type waas waas_global Device(config-profile)# accelerator cifs-express Device(config-waas-cifs)# enable Device(config-waas-cifs)# exit The following example shows how to enter WAAS HTTP configuration mode and enable HTTP-Express accelerator: Device(config)# parameter-map type waas waas_global Device(config-profile)# accelerator http-express Device(config-waas-http)# enable Device(config-waas-http)# exit The following example shows how to enter WAAS SSL configuration mode and enable SSL-Express accelerator: Device(config)#",
