Then as I leveled I'd use the\u00a0Intense\u00a0Training perk to raise my perception to 6 (and unlock perks like\u00a0Sniper,\u00a0Better\u00a0Criticals, etc.) and work on boosting luck, too. This would be for a small guns/energy weapons crit build, which ends up super powerful mid-to late-game.\u00a0 I would advise against the Black Widow perk, as I only ran into a small handful of special dialogue options from that one, although the extra 10% damage to male NPCs is not bad. The male version of this perk, Lady Killer, is probably an even bigger waste (*unless* it offers significantly more new dialogue options), as Lady Killer boosts damage to female NPCs, and most of your foes will be male. I grabbed Comprehension asap early on, as you can get quite\u00a0a few points from Skill Books (there are 324 of these in the game!), and this doubles your point gain. Educated is another great asap perk, as it increases your skill points by three\u00a0with each level-up. The next big one for me was Gunslinger, which boosts one-handed ranged weapon accuracy by 25%.
