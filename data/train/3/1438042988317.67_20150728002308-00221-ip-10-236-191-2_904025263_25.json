            "Hanover is a quiet college town and the city police and school's Safety and Security system work together to ensure the students' safety. On the whole, the regulation and support groups are good and provide helpful services for the students.",
            "Greek life basically dominates the social scene on campus, since there's not much in the form of usual city distractions. Recently they've made and are making some major changes to the Greek system but so far it's been pretty open as far as parties go so that's another reason for the continued popularity for the night life scene.",
            "There are a lot of organizations you can be involved in on campus, so many to the point it can sometimes get overwhelming. But there truly is something for everyone, and the diverse range of groups make for entertaining showcases and activities for the entire student body, members and others alike.",
            "Outdoorsy. Dartmouth has great access to mountains and rivers, so if you love hiking, rock climbing, canoeing, etc., it is the perfect place for you. The class sizes are small so if you're looking for an intimate, tight-knit community, you don't get closer than Dartmouth.",
            "Each season has its own big tradition - Fall is Homecoming, with the bonfire for freshmen, who run around a large fire in the center of the Green (the large green field that serves as the hub of campus) as the rest of the school cheers them on; Winter Carnival in February with events like the snow sculpture, polar bear plunge; and Green Key in May where we enjoy the nice weather and have fun activities outdoors.",
            "Dartmouth is an excellent school, but it's tuition is ridiculously expensive, even among the Ivies and although it has decent financial aid, the tuition only looks to continue rising from here on out.",
            "The great outdoors! The Dartmouth Outing Club has lots of activities in the immediate environment, and Trips before Freshmen Orientation is one of the best bonding experiences at Dartmouth. There are also social activities hosted by the clubs and Greek houses on campus, and there's also Main Street to shop and grab a bite to eat.",
            "You have three major food centers on campus, the Hop, FoCo, and Collis. Each have a different style and feel -- FoCo is a buffet while the Hop and Collis are cafe-style -- but all serve decent food and are good hangout places as well.King Arthur Flour is also excellent for drinks, sandwiches and pastries but unfortunately a little pricey as well.",
            "There are tradeoffs and often large disparities between clusters. Some clusters are extremely new (McLaughlin) and as a result gorgeous and rather spacious. Others have been around for a while and are noticeably smaller and not as luxurious. Also, where you live can also have implications for how your social life is defined, at least during freshman fall. Dorm clusters nearer Frat Row (i.e. Choates, Russell Sage) are generally more rowdy and party-oriented, and dorms further away like East Wheelock typically are quieter, where you'l find relatively less of the going out scene. Some floors are extremely tight-knit, but even this tends to happen only during freshman year and social groups are largely determined by weekend events if anything.",
            "Trimesters mean you move through classes pretty fast, so you have to work to keep on top of things like midterms and projects. Different classes are also structured differently, and some have weekly labs that add to the course load. Because it's a liberal arts school, you get the chance to take a wide variety of classes and are exposed to fascinating classes that you may otherwise not have taken.",
            "Play up your strengths as a student and person, but just be yourself. I know that sounds extremely cheesy and vague, but in the end you want to go to a school that is a good fit for you, and the only way to achieve that without a doubt is to be honest in your representation of yourself and the creation of your goals and ideas for college. Dartmouth encourages a diverse student body in terms of background and experience.",
            "There is no other place like Dartmouth; often people speak of it as a bubble but you'll have great experiences just the same. You'll meet people from all walks of life that not only broaden your worldview but collectively make the campus a more interesting place. Its academic excellence is unparalleled and outdoor activities fantastic, and though it may have areas for improvement, Dartmouth is a wonderful school and I am excited to be able to spend four years in this community."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{87163=There are so many. One of my favorites has to be homecoming. Every homecoming there is a giant camp fire built in the of the green with your class's number on it (for me it was '15). During the ceremony, members of the class run around the fire, one lap for each in your class year. As a members of the class of 2015, most of us ran either 15 laps, 115 laps, or somewhere in between. It is a great bonding experience for members in each class., 12337=During homecoming, students build a giant bonfire as tall as Dartmouth Hall itself. Then, on Dartmouth night, the freshmen have to run around the bonfire the same number of times as their graduating year. So if you graduate in 2015, then you have to run around 15 times. During winter carnival a giant snow sculpture is built in the middle of the green. On the first big snow of the season, an email is sent out to everyone inviting them to a giant snowball fight on the green. Best snowball fight ever! The CT river runs right alongside campus. You can go canoeing for a studybreak or even walk down to the rope-swing for a nice swim. First Year Trips! 95% of freshmen go on them. You are put with a group of 6-9 people and sent into the wilderness for 4 days with upperclassmen trip leaders. Its an amazing experience that give everyone something to talk about when they get to campus! The dartmouth skiway is a 10 minute drive from campus and buses run every day in the winter. Students get discount rentals and lift tickets and can even get paid to be instructors. You can even take skiing for PE credit!, 105888=I was told about the traditional homecoming bonfire and freshmen run, in which the freshmen run around the huge bonfire a certain amount of times, relative to their graduation year. For example, if you'll graduate in 2017 then the tradition would be to run around the bonfire 117 times. Apparently not many freshmen actually complete this except for perhaps the cross country team., 145098=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 120497=Each season has its own big tradition - Fall is Homecoming, with the bonfire for freshmen, who run around a large fire in the center of the Green (the large green field that serves as the hub of campus) as the rest of the school cheers them on; Winter Carnival in February with events like the snow sculpture, polar bear plunge; and Green Key in May where we enjoy the nice weather and have fun activities outdoors., 61731=Dartmouth is sometimes only known for the frat scene, but that's not all there is to do at the college by far. Through the Programming Board, students have the opportunity to see famous acts like Kesha (2010), Immortal Technique (2011) and Avicii (2012). Dartmouth's students are diverse and so spoken word poets such as Shihan Van Clief (2012) and Taylor Mali (2012), as well as various artists, musicians and comedians often pepper students' choices for entertainment. Club sports are very active, as well as various talented a capella groups, such as The Dartmouth Aires, who won 2nd place in the Voice in 2012. What drew me, however, was the Jewlery studio and woodshop in the basement of the Hopkins Center., 15474=With a brand new, all you can eat dining hall that just opened in Fall 2011, the food options are amazing. They switch up the foods every day and always have a number of special events where guest chefs and local farms come to give out food. A lot of the food in the dining halls come from local New Hampshire and Vermont vendors and farmers. The school provides many organic options and is super vegan/vegetarian friendly.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I'm learning as much outside class than inside. I've found that in humanities or social studies classes, it's much more common to just agree with the teacher's ideas than to formulate our own, and our grades improve because of it, which is a shame. I don't know if this is a result of the general liberal leaning of the students here, or just a survival strategy we've developed in a time when college degrees are increasingly commodified and manipulated, but I'd like to hear more balanced discussions in the classroom. Regardless, the professors I've had have all been brilliant, very organized and great lecturers and speakers, and generally very approachable. We really do have the air of a small college - it seems like in two months I've gotten to know enough people that I always see people I know walking on campus on any given day. The D-Plan also allows me to take more classes than at other colleges and allows pre-meds (gasp!) to study abroad, possibly twice! This is almost unheard of at other colleges.
