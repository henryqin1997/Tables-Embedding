            "METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR ELECTRIC FIELD DEPOSITION OF NANOWIRES AND OTHER DEVICES - Methods, systems, and apparatuses for nanowire deposition are provided. A deposition system includes an enclosed flow channel, an inlet port, and an electrical signal source. The inlet port provides a suspension that includes nanowires into the channel. The electrical signal source is coupled to an electrode pair in the channel to generate an electric field to associate at least one nanowire from the suspension with the electrode pair. The deposition system may include various further features, including being configured to receive multiple solution types, having various electrode geometries, having a rotatable flow channel, having additional electrical conductors, and further aspects.",

No orifice is provided on the side of a hydrogen tank having a smaller heat flux value. The orifice has a function of increasing the channel resistance. With the above, it is possible to initially have the hydrogen tank having a smaller heat flux value in the fully charged state, and thereafter the hydrogen tank having a larger heat flux value in the fully charged state.
