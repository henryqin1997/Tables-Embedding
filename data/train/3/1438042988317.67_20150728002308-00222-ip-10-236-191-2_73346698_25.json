            "Debugging standalone PHP applications Thanks hundred times for all the detailed explanations here !! And especially for the note which explains why debugging a CLI application does not work in 1.1.8 version and only in 1.1.9. (wrong port, as I guessed, but I have been looking for this information for some hours before coming here). Unfortunately this 1.1.9 CVS version does not work in the last 3.2.0 Eclipse version I just got. Let us hope the stable version is going quickly.",
