    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students It's great for anybody who like small environments. Being from around a big city, it is relaxing for me to be around a small area for a while. Even though you are in school, it feels like a three month vacation. Tips for prospective students Like any college, work is a must. Being here, it is easy to get distracted to be sure to have strong will power but be sure not to get too overworked. Also, Get involved! Being in a small environment, you get noticed for what you do! So be sure to do stuff. Bang for the buck You will not get views or community like this in many places. People are so close to each other and the area is breathtaking. The college is also great for diversity and small town values. Because of the yearly Field Periods, you can get your foot in the door for careers when you graduate, which you won't find anywhere else, making this requirement priceless! Am enjoying being here You may think Keuka is in the middle of nowhere, but that is far from the truth. Yes, Keuka is in the heart of farm country,",
