Holmes called for a fair catch on a punt return, but let the ball roll through his legs before he was blocked by a trio of Indianapolis players. Caldwell challenged that Holmes touched the ball first before the Colts recovered at the New York 27. However, the Jets were given possession, as was ruled on the field., 41344=Adam Vinatieri kicked a 50-yard field goal with 53 seconds left, giving Indy the lead, but Mark Sanchez led the Jets on a five-play, 40-yard march after Antonio Cromartie returned the kickoff 47 yards. Braylon Edwards made a leaping 18-yard catch along the right sideline to move the ball to the 14, and the Jets called a timeout with three seconds left to set up Folk's winning kick., 43886=Manning then engineered a Colts drive down the field, converting a 3rd-and-8 with an 21-yard strike to Garcon, moving the ball to the New York 18. Vinatieri later connected from 32 yards away with 4:37 remaining., 46052=Manning finally broke the scoreless stalemate with a 57-yard connection to Garcon with 5:25 left in the second quarter., 43176=Tomlinson accounted for the go-ahead touchdown on a one-yard run with barely under 10 minutes left. His plunge into the end zone capped a 17-play, 87-yard drive that ate up nearly 10 minutes, giving New York a 14-10 lead. Sanchez completed all five of his passes during the march and the Jets converted a pair of third downs, one a Sanchez scramble, leading up to the 3rd-and-goal TD run.}",
