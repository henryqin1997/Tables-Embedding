If you email the financial workers they will be more than willing to help you find scholarships that apply directly to you. Bang for the buck Even though Houghton is expensive. The price you pay for the education is worth it. Am enjoying being here The atmosphere here is awesome. Coming from the Philippines, I thought that the transtition would be difficult. I was dreading coming to college because I did not know anybody. However, when I got here I was surprised by how nice the people treat you. They were really open and made my transition easy.
