As a result, a concerted effort was made to focus on issues that were general to UNIX-like systems. In recognition of this widening of scope, the name of the standard was changed to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard or FHS for short., 56964=IEEE standard P1003.2 (POSIX, part 2) makes requirements that are similar to the above section., 88346=This naming of language subdirectories of /usr/share/man is based on Appendix E of the POSIX 1003.1 standard which describes the locale identification string \u2014 the most well-accepted method to describe a cultural environment.

    "textBeforeTable": "The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, are required in /. Requirements Distributions should not create new directories in the root hierarchy without extremely careful consideration of the consequences including for application portability. It evades whatever discipline the system administrator may have set up for distributing standard file hierarchies across mountable volumes. It demands space on a root partition which the system administrator may want kept small and simple for either performance or security reasons. There are several reasons why creating a new subdirectory of the root filesystem is prohibited: \u00a0 Rationale Applications must never create or require special files or subdirectories in the root directory. Other locations in the FHS hierarchy provide more than enough flexibility for any package. Disk errors that corrupt data on the root filesystem are a greater problem than errors on any other partition. A small root filesystem is less prone to corruption as the result of a system crash. While you may have the root filesystem on a large partition, and may be able to fill it to your heart's content, there will be people with smaller partitions. If you have more files installed, you may find incompatibilities with other systems using root",
