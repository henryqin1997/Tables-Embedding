This up coming week on September 20, 2012 there will be a outdoor movie event. They are going to show Hunger Game. I can't wait for that!!!!!!, 31282=mostly people hang out in the quad cafe during lunchtime. but when it starts getting nice outside (from march to october), the quad area is filled with people who are playing ultimate frisbee, soccer, football, whatever you can think of, they're probably doing it at the quad. other than that, the columbia mall is less than five minutes away from the school, which contains a food court, many shopping and game centers, along with all sorts of commercial restaurants surrounding the it. also, there is a movie theater, so a great location for a relaxing movie-and-dinner date., 27710=yes, there are blue lights at hcc, but unfortunately, they are only found in the parking garages and a few spots in the parking lots (at least the one's i've seen). teachers stress on the very first day of class to get the instant updates on your cell phone. the school immediately sends you a message about all types of emergencies and late school openings or closings. it's a very handy tool, so you won't have to wake up extra early to see the 5 o'clock news to see if you have school or not., 177515=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
