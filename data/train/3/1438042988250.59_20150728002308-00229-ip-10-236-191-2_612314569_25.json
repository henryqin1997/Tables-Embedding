            "Description",
            "These data were collected using the CHARTS system. It is owned by the Naval Oceanographic Office and operated through contract. The system collects topographic lidar data at 10 kHz, bathymetric lidar data at 1 kHz and RGBimagery at 1Hz. A CASI-1500 hyperspectral line scanner is integrated with the system as well. Aircraft position, velocity and acceleration information are collected through a combination of Novatel and POS A/V 410 equipment.All raw data streams are transferred to the office for downloading and processing in SHOALS GCS software. Aircraft position data are processed using POSPac software and the results are combined with the lidar data to produce3-D positions for each lidar shot. Upon inspection and QA/QC in the software packages Fledermaus and PFM_ABE, anomalous data are flagged as invalid. PFM_ABE's charts2las module then converts all valid data from ellipsoid toorthometric heights based on the NGS' GEOID03 model and exports topographic and bathymetric data as a series of LAS files, one file per flight line. The format of the file is LAS version 1.2. Data are classified as 0 (validtopographic data), 21 (valid topographic data acquired with the bathymetric sensor), 27 (invalid topographic and bathymetric data), 29 (valid bathymetric data).",
            "The flightline LAS files are imported into GeoCue V7.0.3.5, which is a geospatial workflow production and management software tool employed by JALBTCX to perform and monitor production of data products. Upon import into GeoCue,the flightline LAS files are divided into a series of boxes, each of which are 1500 meters in length and width. A customized classification macro, built upon the TerraScan V11 module within Microstation V8i, classifies validtopographic data as ground points (2) and unclassified points (1). Upon completion the macro, the classification results undergo quality control and any misclassified points are manually edited. In areas of dense vegetation thebare earth ground points might be incorrectly classified due to the inability of the laser to penetrate the canopy and reach the bare ground. In these areas, JALBTCX defaults to the algorithms ground surface instead of manuallyreclassifying those points. The final classification results are comprised of individual lidar points with classifications of ground (2) or unclassified (1). They are partitioned into a series of 5km delivery boxes, oneClassified LAS file per box. The format of the file is LAS version 1.2. Data are classified as 1 (valid non-ground topographic data), 2 (valid ground topographic data), 21 (valid topographic data acquired with the bathymetricsensor), 27 (invalid topographic and bathymetric data), 29 (valid bathymetric data).",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received the las files from JALBTCX on hard drive. The files contained lidar elevation and intensity measurements. The data were received in Geographic, NAD83 coordinates and were vertically referenced to NAVD88 using the Geoid03 model. The vertical units of the data were meters. CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes:1. All points in Class 29 (valid bathymetry) were converted to Class 11. 2. The topographic las files were compressed to laz v1.2 using LASTools' laszip software. 3. GPS Week Time Information was converted to Adjusted Standard GPS Time using LASTools' las2las software. 4. The topographic laz files were converted from orthometric (NAVD88) heights to ellipsoidal heights using Geoid03.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
