The casing has a gas inlet hole and a gas outlet hole formed in a circumferential wall thereof so that the exhaust gas flows in the charging unit through the gas inlet hole and flows out of the ion trapping unit through the gas outlet hole. The gas inlet hole and the gas outlet hole are arranged in such a manner as to at least partially overlap each other when viewed in the given arrangement direction. 09-20-2012 20120262182 FINE PARTICLE DETECTION SYSTEM - There is provided a fine particle detection system with a fine particle sensor, a cable and a sensor drive control device. The fine particle sensor has an ion source unit with first and second electrodes, a particle charging unit and inner and outer sensor casings. The cable has a power supply wiring line connected to the second electrode, an inner shield line electrically continuous with the inner",
