            "There are two dining cafes at Ferris. The first is the Rock Cafe and the other is Westview Dining. Having the chance to work at both of the facilities, I greatly appreciate the work that is put into a days job of making others happy.",

            "Ferris is a small town school that anyone can fit in. The courses are small enough so each student can get personal attention if needed and many opportunities for success are provided for free such as tutoring. At Ferris anything is possible if you set your mind to it."
