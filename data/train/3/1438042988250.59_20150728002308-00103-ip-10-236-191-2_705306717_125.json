The interest expense (net) increased from Rs.3,055 million to Rs.4,816 million mainly due to increased financing requirements and increase in interest rates during fiscal 2007. This increase was offset by foreign exchange gains (net) Rs.1,856 million and increase in other non-operating income of Rs.951 million. Non-operating income for fiscal 2006 included Rs.1,532 million on account of gain of sale of equity interest in subsidiary., 308804=In addition to our automotive operations, we are also involved in various other business activities, of which information technology services and construction equipment manufacturing are the main activities. Net revenues from these activities totaled to Rs.18,061 million and Rs.27,017 million in fiscal 2006 and 2007, respectively, representing nearly 7.4% and 8.1% of our total revenues, before inter segment elimination in these fiscal years., 645290=Mr.\u00a0Ravi Kant (Managing Director). Mr.\u00a0Kant holds a Bachelor of Technology degree from the IIT, Kharagpur and a Masters in Science in management techniques from Aston University, Birmingham, UK. Mr.\u00a0Kant has wide and varied experience in the manufacturing and marketing field, particularly in the automobile industry. Prior to joining us, he was with Philips India Limited as Director of Consumers Electronics business and prior to that, with LML Ltd. as Senior Executive Director (Marketing) and Titan Watches Limited as Vice President (Sales\u00a0& Marketing). Mr.\u00a0Kant was also employed with Kinetic Engineering Limited, Hindustan Aluminum Company Limited and Hawkins Cookers Limited. Mr.\u00a0Kant had been an Executive Director since May 2000, responsible for manufacturing and marketing of commercial vehicles and manufacturing of utility vehicles and was appointed as our Managing Director on July\u00a029, 2005 and now overseas our day to day operations. Mr.\u00a0Kant is our CEO., 280225=In fiscal 2007, our top five export destinations accounted for approximately 65% and 87% of our exports of commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles respectively. South Africa remained our largest export destination for the commercial vehicles as well as passenger vehicles. Other key markets were the Middle East, western Africa, Turkey and western Europe. We are strengthening our position in the geographic areas we are currently operating in and exploring possibilities of entering new markets with similar market characteristics to the Indian market., 313275=Telco Construction Equipment Company Limited, or Telcon, is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sale of construction equipment and providing related supporting services. We own 60% of Telcon, with the remaining 40% being held by Hitachi Construction Machinery Company Limited, Japan. With the increase in economic activity especially in the infrastructure sector, Telcon recorded its best performance to date having sold 5,360 machines in fiscal 2007 compared to 3,674 machines in fiscal 2006, with a net revenue of Rs.16,057.7 million in fiscal 2007 compared to Rs.11,483.5 in fiscal 2006, a profit after tax of Rs.1,771.8 million in fiscal 2007 compared to Rs.755.9 million in fiscal 2006 (representing an increase of 134%)., 312723=The consolidated revenue of the TTL Group was Rs.8,107 million in fiscal 2007, an increase of 97% as compared to Rs.4,110 million in the previous fiscal year due to augmented relationships with existing global automotive and aerospace customers and the acquisition of new customers., 156359=2005, 188896=Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations, New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing rules and Indian stock market listing regulations, have increased complexity for us. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such governance standards., 238898=During fiscal 2007, the Indian automobile industry production grew by 13.6% to nearly 11\u00a0million vehicles. Of these, nearly 76% were two wheelers and over 5% were three wheelers. 1.5\u00a0million passenger vehicles, utility vehicles and multi purpose vans were produced in fiscal 2007, representing 14% of vehicles produced. In addition, nearly 0.5\u00a0million commercial vehicles were manufactured, constituting 4.7% of total vehicle production. Presently, car penetration in India is low at 7 cars per 1,000 persons, and that number is expected to increase in coming years., 219122=We believe that the foundation of our growth over the last 50 years has been a deep understanding of economic stimuli and customer needs, and the ability to translate them into customer desired products though leading edge research and development. With 1,400 engineers and scientists, our Engineering Research Centre, established in 1966, has enabled us to successfully design, develop and produce our own range of vehicles, as well as a significant portion of our production facilities, assembly lines and machinery. In addition, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary under the name Tata Motors European Technical Centre PLC, or TMETC, in the United Kingdom, in the field of automobile research. We believe this research center will also facilitate the development of our products, in particular, our passenger cars. Our research and development network also includes the facilities of TDCV in South Korea, and those of Hispano in Spain, in addition to research and development centers in Pune, Jamshedpur and Lucknow in India., 921094=Management\u0092s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as at March\u00a031, 2007 has been audited by Deloitte Haskins and Sells, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item\u00a018, which expresses an unqualified opinion on management\u0092s assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as at March\u00a031, 2007., 496654=increase in revenues reported by automotive subsidiaries during fiscal 2006., 550461=Our total debt stood at Rs.79,137 million as of March\u00a031, 2007 compared to Rs.36,641 million as of March\u00a031, 2006. This increase was mainly on account of an increase in short term debt raised during the fiscal year to fund the growth in our vehicle financing activity and an increase in long term debt raised to support our on going capital expenditure program and our growing vehicle financing activity. The short term debt, excluding the current portion of the long-term debt, was Rs.33,145 million as of March\u00a031, 2007 as compared to Rs.7,973 million as of March\u00a031, 2006, while the long term debt, excluding the current portion, increased from Rs.27,203 million to Rs.40,235 million as of March\u00a031, 2007. Including the current portion of long-term debt, the short term debt was Rs.38,902 million as of March\u00a031, 2007 compared to Rs.9,438 million as of March\u00a031, 2006, respectively., 163637=May 2007, 972992=In our opinion, management\u0092s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control \u0097 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission., 489471=Continued cost reductions, which were partially offset by an increase in input commodity prices. Prices of commodity items, particularly steel, non-ferrous metals, rubber and engineering plastics, witnessed an upward movement, which was partially offset by the cost reduction initiatives pursued by the company. Consequently, our raw material cost as a proportion of our total revenues increased to 62.6% in fiscal 2007 from 62.4% in fiscal 2006., 567651=As of March\u00a031, 2007, approximately 53.4% of our long-term debt was denominated in rupees and the balance was denominated in dollars and other non-rupee currencies. During fiscal 2007, our effective cost of borrowing increased due to increase in interest rates in India during the fiscal year., 584651=Since fiscal 1997, we have benefited from participation in the Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme, or the EPCG Scheme, which permits us to import capital equipment under a special license at a substantially reduced customs duty, subject to us fulfilling an obligation to export goods manufactured or produced by the use of capital equipment imported under the EPCG Scheme to the value of a multiple of the\u00a0cost insurance and freight value of these imports or customs duty saved, over a period of\u00a08 or 12 years from the date of obtaining the special license.\u00a0We currently hold\u00a0eight licenses that require us to export our products of a value of approximately Rs.71.49 billion between 2002 and 2015, and we carefully monitor our progress in meeting our incremental milestones.\u00a0Of this amount, we have already achieved exports of approximately Rs.50.05\u00a0billion\u00a0as of March\u00a031, 2007.\u00a0This leaves us with a remaining obligation to export products of a value of approximately Rs.21.44 billion by\u00a0March 2015.\u00a0In the event that the export obligation under the EPCG Scheme is not fulfilled, we would have to pay the differential between the reduced and normal duty on the goods imported along with interest.\u00a0In view of our past record of exceeding our export milestones, and our current plans with respect to our export markets, we do not currently foresee any impediments to meeting our export obligations in the required time frame., 196633=There may be a different level of regulation and monitoring of the Indian securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and other participants than in the United States. The SEBI received statutory powers in 1992 to assist it in carrying out its responsibility for improving disclosure and other regulatory standards for the Indian securities markets. Subsequently, SEBI has prescribed regulations and guidelines in relation to disclosure requirements, insider dealing and other matters relevant to the Indian securities market. There may, however, be less publicly available information about Indian companies than is regularly made available by public companies in the United States., 967551=September 24, 2007.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 553303=Our investment portfolio decreased to Rs.22,258 million as of March\u00a031, 2007 compared to Rs.24,851 million as of March\u00a031, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of available-for-sale investments during the year., 604499=We have provided bank guarantees aggregating Rs. 11,767\u00a0million relating to certain securitized receivables to certain special purpose entities (\u0093SPEs\u0094). Our liability would crystallize in the event customers fail to fulfill their obligations under the contract and the SPE serves a notice of shortfall in collections on us. The term of each guarantee depends upon the weighted average term of each pool of finance receivables securitized. In the event a guarantee is called, we have the right to repossess the financed vehicle and to auction the vehicle. The maximum potential amount of future payment that we would be required to make is Rs.11,767 million as of March\u00a031, 2007. We have recognized a liability of Rs.1,079 million for these guarantees., 155484=2006, 279731=We are expanding our international export operations, which have been ongoing since 1961. Our exports of vehicles manufactured in India increased by 6.5% in fiscal 2007 to 53,474 units from 50,223 units exported in fiscal 2006. We market our commercial and passenger vehicles in several countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Australia, South East Asia and South Asia., 504330=Share of minority interest in profits of consolidated subsidiaries during fiscal 2006 was Rs.331 million as compared to Rs.366 million in fiscal 2005. The decline is mainly on account of the reduction in the rate of profit by TACO., 906797=The sensitivity to a change in interest rates of 1% on our unhedged floating rate loans as at March\u00a031, 2006 and March\u00a031, 2007 is Rs. 111\u00a0million and Rs. 252\u00a0million, respectively, on an annual basis. The sensitivity to a change in interest rates of 1% on the value of our portfolio of marketable securities as at March\u00a031, 2006 and 2007 is Rs. 33\u00a0million and Rs. 29\u00a0million, respectively., 823514=Our ordinary shares are freely transferable, subject only to the provisions of the Companies Act under which, if a transfer of shares contravenes the SEBI provisions or the regulations issued under it or any other law for the time being in force or the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, or SICA, or any other similar law, the Indian Company Law Board may, on an application made by the company, a depository incorporated in India, an investor, the SEBI or other parties, direct a rectification of the register of records. If a company without sufficient cause refuses to register a transfer of shares within two months from the date on which the instrument of transfer is delivered to the company, the transferee may appeal to the Indian Company Law Board seeking to register the transfer of equity shares. The Indian Company Law Board may in its discretion, issue an interim order suspending the voting rights attached to the relevant equity shares before completing its investigation of the alleged contravention. Under the Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 2002, the operative provisions of which are yet to come into force, the Indian Company Law Board is proposed to be replaced with the National Company Law Tribunal. Further, under the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003, the SICA is sought to be repealed and the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, as constituted under the SICA, is to be replaced with the National Company Law Tribunal., 954622=September\u00a024, 2007, 586777=In fiscal 2007 and 2006, 31% and 24%, respectively, of our sales volumes were financed under hire-purchase/loan contracts to our customers. As of March\u00a031, 2007 and 2006, our customer finance receivable portfolio was comprised of 383,738 contracts and 228,838 contracts, respectively, with gross stock-on-hire of approximately Rs.157,330 million and Rs.90,167 million, respectively. We follow specified internal procedures including quantitative guidelines for selection of our finance customers to assist in managing default and repayment risk in our portfolio, and take security against loans extended. We originate all the contracts through our authorized dealers with whom we have long-term agreements. All our marketing and sales activity is undertaken through dealers, including our division known as Tata Motorfinance and our subsidiary company Tata Motor Finance Ltd., and collections are carried out by our authorized dealers., 475336=Revenues from the domestic market for fiscal 2007 increased by 34.9% to Rs.267,419 million from Rs.198,172 million while revenues from markets outside India increased by 51% to Rs.64,106 million from Rs.42,443 million in 2006. The proportion of total revenues from markets outside India has increased from 5.4% in fiscal 2003 to 19.3% in fiscal 2007. This has been driven by our continued focus on improving our presence in international markets, through expansion of both our automotive and non-automotive businesses. We seek to continue to grow the proportion of revenues we draw from international operations., 487037=Share of minority interest in profits of consolidated subsidiaries in fiscal 2007 increased to Rs.719 million compared to Rs.331 million in fiscal 2006. The increase is on account of profits attributable to minorities consequent to increased minority holding in Telcon from 20% to 40% in December 2005, coupled with higher profits of Telcon during the fiscal 2007., 453921=*\u00a0\u00a0Includes gain on shares issued by subsidiary companies and gain on sale of holding in subsidiary companies with respect to fiscal 2006., 323364=Tata Sons Limited , or Tata Sons, is a principal holding company that has equity holdings in a range of businesses. The various companies promoted by Tata Sons, including us, are based substantially in India and had combined revenues of approximately US $ 29 billion for fiscal 2007., 402956=the Korean market by TDCV has helped us to further consolidate our position in the domestic Korean market. Our joint venture with Marcopolo in Brazil, which we announced in May 2006, and our 21% stake in Hispano are expected to enhance our leadership position in the bus market through better technological capabilities in bus body building. Our proposed joint venture with Fiat to manufacture passenger cars, engines and transmissions would provide us with access to world class car engine technology and is expected to help us to further strengthen our position in the passenger vehicle category. Further, TMETC provides us with design engineering support and development services, complementing and strengthening our skill sets., 848943=Foreign Institutional Investors who are registered with the SEBI are required to comply with the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations, 1995, or Foreign Institutional Investor Regulations.

We manufacture a variety of light commercial vehicles, or LCV, including pick-ups and trucks and buses with a gross vehicle weight, or GVW, between 0.7 ton and 7.5 tons. This also includes the Tata Ace, India\u0092s first indigenously developed mini-truck with a 0.7 ton payload, launched in fiscal 2006., 685402=The Nominations Committee was constituted on July\u00a025, 2006, with the objective of identifying independent directors to be appointed to the Board from time to time to refresh its constitution. The Nominations Committee is comprised of N. N. Wadia, Chairman, Ratan N. Tata, N. A. Soonawala and S. M. Palia., 306567=Our capital expenditure aggregated to Rs.9,163 million, Rs.10,734 million and Rs.25,277 million during fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Our capital expenditure during the past three years has been related mostly to capacity expansion for new and existing products to meet the market demand and investments towards improving quality, reliability and productivity that are aimed at operational efficiency., 920080=Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control \u0097 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

This impacted our borrowing costs and vehicle financing rates during fiscal 2007., 198909=India is not a party to any international treaty in relation to the recognition or enforcement of foreign judgments. Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is provided under Section\u00a013 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, or the Civil Code., 639861=Dr.\u00a0J.J. Irani. Dr.\u00a0Irani obtained a B.Sc. degree from Science College, Nagpur in 1956 with a Gold Medal in Geology and a M.Sc. (Geology) degree from the Nagpur University in 1958, both with first class.

This increase was offset by gain on sale of holding in subsidiaries of Rs. 1,532. The balance represents net increase in other non-operating revenue., 209714=We were incorporated on September\u00a01, 1945 as a public limited liability company under the Indian Companies Act VII of 1913 as Tata Locomotive and Engineering Company Limited. Our name was changed to Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Limited on September\u00a024, 1960 and to Tata Motors Limited on July\u00a029, 2003.

The Winger\u0097India\u0092s only maxi-van, offers a blend of the comfort of a car with the spaciousness of a bus for intra-city and long distance transportation needs.

The growth was driven by an increase in total vehicle volumes of 28.2%, improved realization per vehicle, continued robust growth in our vehicle financing activity resulting in 36.6% increase in revenues from automotive operations. Further, growth in revenues of our key non-automotive subsidiaries, namely Telcon, which registered a 39.8% increase in its revenues during fiscal 2007 and TTL which registered a 97.0% increase in its revenues during fiscal 2007., 405155=Our overall sales in international markets (including TDCV and Hispano sales) increased 11.9% to 62,622 units in fiscal 2007 as compared to 55,957 units in fiscal 2006. This was driven by sustained efforts towards a focused entry in to new export markets and also strengthening of our presence in existing markets. Key export markets for our automotive operations were south Africa, west Asia, Europe and south-east Asia., 506580=Continued cost reductions, which were partially offset by an increase in input commodity prices. While the prices of steel softened during fiscal 2006, the prices of non-ferrous commodities continued an upward trend during the year. Consequently, our raw material cost as a proportion of our total revenues decreased to 62.4% in fiscal 2006 from 64.2% in fiscal 2005. The other elements of cost of sales increased to 16.3% in fiscal 2006 from 14.8% in fiscal 2005, 783467=Jun 2007, 511300=In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.

The company is evaluating the application of this statement., 283565=One of the most significant achievements of ERC has been the design and development of our compact car the Tata Indica, which is India\u0092s only indigenously developed compact car.

The growth was driven by an increase in total vehicle volumes of 13.8%, improved realization per vehicle and robust growth in our vehicle financing business following the amalgamation of the erstwhile Tata Finance Ltd. This has resulted in 30.9% increase in revenues of automotive segment. Further, growth in revenues of our key non-automotive subsidiaries, namely TTL, registered a 200% increase in its revenues and Telcon which registered a 39.3% increase in its revenues during fiscal 2007., 191833=Since 1991, successive Indian Governments have pursued policies of economic liberalization, including significantly relaxing restrictions on the private sector. Nevertheless, the roles of the Indian central and state governments in the Indian economy as producers, consumers and regulators have remained significant. Consequent to an election in April and May 2004, there was a change in government. While the current coalition government has already committed to a common minimum agenda, there can be no assurance that there will not be changes in the economic reform, and specific laws and policies affecting automotive companies, foreign investment, currency exchange and investment regulations governing India\u0092s capital markets that could negatively affect us. Uncertainty regarding possible policy changes immediately after elections has in the past resulted in significant volatility in price and trading volumes of securities of Indian companies. A significant change in India\u0092s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could adversely affect business and economic conditions in India generally, and our business in particular, if new restrictions on the private sector are introduced or if existing restrictions are increased., 730855=We purchase materials, supplies, assets and services from numerous suppliers throughout the world in the ordinary course of business, including from our affiliates and firms with which certain members of our board of directors are interested. We purchased materials, supplies, fixed assets and services from these entities in the amount of Rs.13,701 million, Rs.16,498 million and Rs.21,857 million in fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

We sold products and services to these entities in the amount of Rs.3,538 million, Rs.1,468 million and Rs.2,059 million in fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. We believe all of these purchase and sale transactions were arm\u0092s-length transactions, none of which were material to our overall operations. See note 26 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our related party transactions with our affiliates and other related parties. The foregoing do not include transactions with and among our consolidated subsidiaries, the amounts of which are eliminated upon consolidation when preparing our financial statements., 268128=Note:1. The table does not include the sale of 209 units and 1,328 units of Fiat vehicles during fiscal 2006 and 2007, respectively, 508857=In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management\u0092s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit., 407812=On a geographical basis, revenues from sales in India increased by 34.9% to Rs.267,419 million in fiscal 2007 from Rs.198,172 million in fiscal 2006., 274040=Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles: Our M&HCVs have a wide range of applications and are generally configured as trucks, tippers, buses, tankers, tractors or concrete mixers.

In the M&HCV segment, we recorded a 34.4% growth in sales and increased our market share by 0.7 percentage points to 62.7% in fiscal 2007. The overall growth in the M&HCV market was mainly due to a growing shift towards higher tonnage vehicles like haulage tractors and multi axle vehicles and our buses and coaches finding greater acceptance. We also launched Bharat Stage III compliant (equivalent to Euro III norms) vehicles in the M&HCV category., 847170=In September 1992, the Government issued guidelines that enable foreign institutional investors, including institutions such as pension funds, investment trusts, asset management companies, nominee companies and incorporated/institutional portfolio managers referred to as Foreign Institutional Investors, or FIIs, to make portfolio investments in all securities of listed and unlisted companies in India.

Foreign investors wishing to invest and trade in Indian securities in India under these guidelines are required to register with the SEBI and obtain a general permission from the RBI under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. However, since the SEBI provides a single window clearance, a single application must be made to the SEBI.

We had accounts payable to these entities in the amount of Rs.723 million and Rs.1,284 million as of March\u00a031,\u00a02006 and 2007, respectively., 422151=Interest rates and availability of credit for vehicle purchases. While interest rates steadily declined from the beginning of fiscal 2001 and credit finance for vehicle purchases became more widely available, interest rates began to increase during the second half of fiscal 2006 and increased further during the latter part of fiscal 2007. For further discussion of our credit support programs, see Item\u00a04.B \u0093\u0097Business Overview\u0097Automotive Operations\u0097Sales and Distribution of Vehicles\u0094., 911622=The sensitivity to a change in currency prices of 1%\u00a0per US$ on our unhedged foreign currency loans as at March\u00a031, 2007 and 2006 is Rs. 362 million and Rs.260 million, respectively., 882655=U.S. Holders. Under the United States federal income tax laws, and subject to the passive foreign investment company, or PFIC rules described below, if you are a U.S. holder, the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) is subject to United States federal income taxation.

In order to determine the shareholders entitled to dividends, we keep the register of shareholders closed for approximately 21 days, generally in June or July of each year. Under the listing regulations of the stock exchanges on which our outstanding shares are listed, we may, upon at least 15 days\u0092 advance notice to these stock exchanges, set a record date and/or close the register of shareholders in order to ascertain the identity of shareholders entitled to the dividend. The trading of shares and the delivery of certificates in respect thereof may continue while the register of shareholders is closed., 900344=We are subject to the information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, in accordance therewith, will file annual reports on Form 20-F within six months of our fiscal year end and furnish other reports and information on Form 6-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports and other information can be inspected at the public reference room at the Securities and Exchange Commission and at the Securities and Exchange Commission regional offices listed above. You can also obtain copies of this material from the public reference room, the regional offices or by calling or writing the Securities and Exchange Commission upon payment of a prescribed fee. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements to shareholders., 727475=The total permitted holding of Foreign Institutional Investors, or FIIs, in our paid up share capital has been increased to 35% by a resolution passed by our shareholders on January\u00a022, 2004. The holding of FIIs in us as of March\u00a031, 2007, was approximately 18.01%. See Item\u00a010.D \u0093\u0097 Exchange Controls\u0094 for further details., 912760=The fair value of some of our investments in available-for-sale securities exposes us to equity price risks. In general, these securities are not held for trading purposes. These investments are subject to changes in the market prices of the securities. The fair value of our available-for-sale, equity securities as of March\u00a031, 2007 and 2006 was Rs.15,870 million and Rs.17,311 million respectively. A 1% change in equity prices of available-for-sale securities held as at March\u00a031, 2007 and 2006 would result in an impact of Rs.159 million and Rs.173 million, respectively., 401152=Our presence across the major four wheel auto product categories, our low cost manufacturing capabilities and our expansive distribution and service network facilitate our market leadership in the auto industry in the country. Also, we are working towards the development of new products, in all segments of commercial vehicles and development of new platforms to replace our current compact car, mid size car and utility vehicle platforms to compete effectively in the challenging competitive environment. The distribution of the Tata ACE, which has created a niche for itself in the below-1 ton category of the commercial vehicle industry since the launch in May 2005, was extended across the country during fiscal 2007. The successful introduction of such products has helped us to become the market leader in the LCV category in India., 157216=2004, 973875=We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March\u00a031, 2007 of the Company, and our report dated September 24, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements., 5043=Commission file number: 001-32294, 254276=The revenues from our automotive operations were Rs.224,753 million and Rs.307,113 million in fiscal 2006 and 2007, respectively. Our main market is the Indian market, which accounted for approximately 82.4% and 80.7% of our total revenues and 87.9% and 89.4% of our unit sales in fiscal 2006 and 2007, respectively., 959819=Consolidated balance sheets as of March\u00a031, 2006 and 2007, 682605=We have not issued any stock options to our directors/employees. The Remuneration Committee is comprised of two independent and two non-executive directors, namely N.N. Wadia (from July 2007), Chairman, Ratan N. Tata, N.A. Soonawala, V.R. Mehta and S. A. Naik (until July 2007)., 556848=In July 2003, we raised US$ 100\u00a0million through an offering of 1% convertible notes, due in 2008. The notes are convertible into ordinary shares or global depositary shares, at the option of the holder, at a price of Rs.250.745 per ordinary share. The notes are subject to redemption at our option any time after July\u00a031, 2006. Unless previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the Notes are redeemable on July\u00a031, 2008 at 116.824% of the principal amount. US$ 0.06\u00a0million of these notes were outstanding as on March\u00a031, 2007., 551500=As of March\u00a031, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents of Rs.7,653 million of which Rs. 997 million is held foreign currencies compared to Rs.6,316 million of which Rs. 1,678 million is held in foreign currencies as of March\u00a031, 2006. Short-term bank deposits were Rs.173 million as of March\u00a031, 2007 as compared to Rs.4,915 million as of March\u00a031, 2006. This decline is attributable to utilization of such deposits., 704904=The following tables set forth a breakdown of persons employed by our business segments and by geographic location as of March\u00a031, 2007., 482725=Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by Rs.9,037 million to Rs.35,623 million in fiscal 2007 from Rs.26,586 million in fiscal 2006. This was partially due to an increase in outward shipping expenses of Rs.8,549 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to Rs.6,092 million during fiscal 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 10.7% during fiscal 2007 compared with 11.0% during fiscal 2006., 1006884=Ordinary shares; Par value Rs. 10\u00a0per share; authorized 410,000,000 and 450,000,000 shares, as of March\u00a031, 2006 and 2007 respectively, issued and fully paid up 382,820,381 and shares 385,360,135 as of March\u00a031, 2006 and 2007 respectively; issued and partly paid up 13,750 shares partly paid up, both years, 162775=June 2007, 582113=Rs.799 million, Rs.5,113 million and Rs.11,767 million in fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively with respect to other guarantees, including with respect to receivables assigned by way of securitization, and, 269673=We are also present in the entry mid-size car category through our sedan, the Tata Indigo, and its station wagon version, the Tata Indigo Marina, which are both derived from the Indica platform. The entry mid-size car category continued to decline for the second year, posting a decline of 27% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. With sales of 34,310 vehicles, the Tata Indigo range continued to be the best seller in the entry mid-size car category with a 38% market share in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we introduced a new 1.4 litre, 101 horse power gasoline engine and a 70 horse power common rail diesel (DICOR family) engine on the Indigo range as well as a facelift. We also expanded the Indigo range and opened a new niche by launching a long wheel base Indigo XL \u0097 a premium stretch sedan with high-end features previously available only in very premium executive cars which is price positioned in the upper mid-size category., 496858=Domestic sales of vehicles produced by us during fiscal 2006 grew by 9.4% despite the uncertainties created by changes in automotive regulations. The increase was largely due to the successful launch of Tata Ace, Indica Turbo diesel, Indica Xeta and other variants during the fiscal year and also partially due to the successful implementation of the ban on overloading of trucks in the country towards the end of the fiscal year. International sales continued to grow during fiscal 2006 as a result of our successful entry into South Africa and increased focus on other traditional export markets. Continued focus on the Auto Financing business, following the merger TFL with us, facilitated increased growth of this business. As of the end of fiscal 2006, 23.8% of our vehicles sold in the domestic market were financed by this unit as against 18.3% in fiscal 2005., 189809=In connection with our Annual Report on Form 20-F for fiscal 2007, our management assessed our internal controls over financial reporting, and determined that our internal controls were effective as of March 31, 2007, and our auditors have issued an unqualified attestation with respect to our management\u0092s assessment. We will undertake management assessments of our internal controls over financial reporting in connection with each annual report. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. However, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management resources and time., 429893=In fiscal 2007, we sold 589,428 units (including 8,588 units sold by TDCV and 560 units sold by Hispano), as compared to 459,863 units (including 5,734 units by TDCV) sold in fiscal 2006, representing an increase of 28.2%. Our domestic market share in the four wheel vehicle market in India was 28.5% in fiscal 2007 as compared to 27% in fiscal 2006. The volumes in the international business grew 11.9% to 62,622 units sold in fiscal 2007 from 55,957 units sold in fiscal 2006., 152436=The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years ended March\u00a031, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, information with respect to the exchange rate between the rupee and the dollar (in rupees per dollar) based on the average of the cable transfer buying and selling rupee / dollar exchange rates quoted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York., 421044=General economic conditions. We, similar to the rest of the domestic automotive industry, are substantially affected by general economic conditions in India. See Item\u00a03.D \u0093\u0097Risk Factors\u0097Risks associated with Our Business and the Indian Automotive Industry\u0094. General economic conditions could have a significant adverse impact on our sales and results of operations. Economic conditions have improved since fiscal 2002, which has led to our strong growth in fiscal 2005,2006 and 2007., 289535=India is a member of the World Trade Organization. In compliance with its obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property, or TRIPS, India grants statutory protection to various forms of intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, industrial designs and trademarks. The Trade Marks Act, 1999 and the Copyright Act, 1957, as amended, which are currently in force in India, are TRIPS compliant. The Patents Act, 2002, as amended, to the extent that it relates to our business and operations, provides adequate product and process patent protection in India in accordance with its obligations under TRIPS. The United States has placed India on its \u0093priority watch list\u0094 under Section\u00a0301 of\u00a0TRIPS for failing to provide adequate levels of protection for intellectual property rights. Although we have never experienced any material difficulties in protecting our brands and other intellectual property in India, the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in India has not been and may not be as effective as in the United States., 279082=Demand for our vehicles in the Indian market is subject to seasonal variations. Demand generally peaks between January and March, although there is a decrease in demand in February just before release of the Indian Fiscal Budget. Demand is usually lean from April to July and picks up again in the festival season from September onwards with a decline in December due to year end., 886627=Capital Gains Generally. Under Section\u00a0115AC and other applicable provisions of the Income tax act 1961, any gain realized on the sale outside India of the ADSs from one non-resident of India to another non-resident holder is not subject to Indian capital gains tax. However, it is unclear whether a capital gain derived from the sale of rights by a non-resident of India to another non-resident holder outside India may be subject to Indian capital gains tax., 170601=In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience foreign exchange losses and gains on obligations denominated in foreign currencies in respect of our borrowings and foreign currency assets and liabilities due to currency fluctuations. While the rupee\u0092s appreciation against the dollar in the last four months of fiscal 2007 has contributed positively to our financial condition and results of operations, any depreciation in the value of the rupee against the dollar may lead to adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations during the current fiscal year and in the future periods, partly due to an increase in our dollar and/or Japanese Yen denominated debt., 547677=There was a net cash inflow from financing activities of Rs.9,987 million, Rs.4,450 million and Rs.38,474 million during fiscals 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. During fiscal 2007, we repaid long term debt of Rs.2,292 million, and Rs.21,667 million was received from proceeds related to the issue of long term debt., 432139=In June 2006, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Fiat group to establish an industrial joint venture in India to manufacture passenger vehicles, engines and transmissions for the Indian and the overseas markets. We also distribute Fiat cars in India through select dealer outlets. We sold over 1,300 units of Fiat cars during fiscal 2007. We licensed our LCV pick-up manufacturing technology to Fiat for manufacture and sale of LCV pick-ups under the Fiat brand in South America. Also, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Marcopolo, a leading bus body manufacturing company from Brazil, for setting up a joint venture company to manufacture and assemble fully-built buses and coaches in India which we currently expect will enable us to improve production and technological capabilities in bus body building. In December 2006, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Thonburi Automotive Assembly Plant Co., or Thonburi, Thailand, to manufacture pick-ups in Thailand. We own 70% of the joint venture, while Thonburi owns the remaining 30%. This joint venture will facilitate our efforts to address the Thailand market, which is a major market for pick-ups, and other potential markets in that region. In February 2007, we announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Iveco, a company of Fiat Group, to analyze the feasibility of cooperation, across markets, in the area of Commercial Vehicles. The Memorandum of Understanding would encompass a number of potential developments in engineering, manufacturing, sourcing and distribution of products, aggregates and components. Definitive agreements are anticipated to be entered into in the course of the coming months, if the venture is found feasible., 758374=2008, 483308=Research and development expenses increased by 29.1% to Rs.6,018 million in fiscal 2007 from Rs.4,663 million in fiscal 2006 as a result of our ongoing initiative towards design and development of new vehicle models across all product categories, including the small car.

The growth rate of the Indian automotive industry in terms of sales volume increased from 12.8% in fiscal 2006 to 21.4% in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2007, the industry continued to experience rising input costs and retail incentives, which in turn put pressure on margins., 552056=Gross accounts receivables increased by 35.1% during fiscal 2007 by Rs.5,203 million to Rs.20,031 million as of March\u00a031, 2007., 324192=Tata Sons has its origins in the trading business founded by Jamsetji Tata in 1874 that was developed and expanded in furtherance of his ideals by his two sons, Sir Dorabji Tata and Sir Ratan Tata, following their father\u0092s death in 1904.

FAS 158 requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of their defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or a liability on their balance sheets, and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. The company adopted the provisions regarding recognition of funded status and disclosure under FAS 158 for the year ended March 31, 2007. See note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of the adoption of the provisions of SFAS 158., 501120=Our consolidated operating income increased by Rs.1,251 million to Rs.20,042 million during fiscal 2006 from Rs.18,791 million in fiscal 2005., 891556=Capital Losses. The Section\u00a0115AC Regime does not deal with capital losses arising on a transfer of shares. In general terms, losses arising from a transfer of a capital asset in India can only be set off only against capital gains and not against any other income. A short-term capital loss can be set off against a capital gain, whether short-term or long-term. However, long term capital loss can only be set off against long term capital gain and not against short term capital gain. To the extent that the losses are not absorbed in the year of transfer, they may be carried forward for a period of eight assessment years immediately succeeding the assessment year for which the loss was first determined and may be set off against the capital gains assessable for such subsequent assessment years. In order to set off capital losses in this manner, the non-resident investor would be required to file appropriate and timely tax returns in India. The long term capital loss arising on sale of equity shares in respect of which STT is paid may not be available for set-off against any capital gains., 268552=Passenger cars: The small car category, which consists of mini and compact cars, constitutes nearly 60% of total domestic passenger car sales. In fiscal 2007, the small car category grew by nearly 26% to 832,000 vehicles and had 10 competing models. The Tata Indica, which competes in this category, posted a 30% growth in sales to 144,690 units in fiscal 2007, which was the highest sales for any small car model during any year in the domestic market. The launch of new turbo-diesel and 1.2 litre gasoline versions of the Tata Indica in the latter half of fiscal 2006 helped us to grow our presence appreciably in the gasoline engine segment and defend our diesel segment leadership despite new offerings from our competitors. The new 1.2 litre gasoline version of the Indica range is eligible for excise duty concessions under the Government\u0092s small car definition. The Tata Indica increased its market share from 16.9% in fiscal 2006 to 17.4% in fiscal 2007 in the small car category., 490912=Net income as a percentage of total revenues declined to 5.5% in fiscal 2007 from 6.2% in fiscal 2006., 648688=The following table provides the annual compensation paid to our Directors and Executive Officers for fiscal 2007., 620808=As of March\u00a031, 2007, our Directors and Executive Officers, in their sole and joint names, beneficially held an aggregate of 77,572 shares (approximately 0.02% of our issued share capital).

This growth was attributable to increased industrial activity and continued investment in road infrastructure. Inflationary concerns during the year prompted an increase in interest rates, which adversely affected commercial vehicle sales since the third quarter of fiscal 2007., 272960=Light Commercial Vehicles (including pick-ups): Our range of LCVs includes small commercial vehicles, pick-ups, trucks and buses up to 7.5 GVW. In the LCV segment, we recorded a 45.8% growth in sales and increased our market share by 5.3 percentage points to 65.4% in fiscal 2007. The overall growth in the LCV market was mainly due to sales of our mini truck, the Tata Ace. We rolled out the 100,000th Tata Ace in a record time of 22 months since its launch in May 2005. The Tata Ace also won the Business World \u0096 Marico\u0092s \u0093Business Innovation 2006\u0094 award., 318112=In the Indian Union Budget for fiscal 2007, the Government of India has reduced the Excise duty on small cars from 24% to 16%.

Sales of our utility vehicles \u0097 the Tata Safari and the Tata Sumo \u0097 grew by 26.3% to 47,892 units in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Tata Safari sales grew by 237% over last year, reaching a record high of 15,816 units in fiscal 2007, based on price re-positioning of the range effected mainly through a focused cost reduction effort on the platform. We increased our overall market share in the utility vehicle category to 21.7% in fiscal 2007 from 19.5% in fiscal 2006., 68541=The following table sets forth selected financial data including selected historical financial information as of and for each of the fiscal years ended March\u00a031, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or US GAAP., 396236=Our revenues from automotive operations increased 36.6% to Rs.307,113 million in fiscal 2007 compared to Rs.224,753 million in fiscal 2006, representing 91.9% and 92.6% of our total revenue before inter-segment eliminations in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively., 964869=We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control \u0097 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 24, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on management\u0092s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting., 293392=As part of our strategy to become a low-cost vehicle manufacturer, we have undertaken various initiatives to reduce our fixed and variable costs including an e-sourcing initiative started in 2002 through which we procure some supplies through reverse auctions. We have established a procedure for ensuring quality control of outsourced components. Products purchased from approved sources undergo a supplier quality improvement process. We also have a program for assisting vendors from whom we purchase raw materials or components to maintain quality. Each vendor is reviewed on a quarterly basis on parameters of quality, cost and delivery. Preference is given to vendors with QS-9000 certification. We also maintain a stringent quality assurance program that includes random testing of production samples, frequent re-calibration of production equipment and analysis of post-production vehicle performance and ongoing dialogue with workers to reduce production errors. Further, in April 2003, we established a Strategic Sourcing Group to consolidate, strategize and monitor our supply chain activities with respect to major items of purchase as well as major inputs of technology and services. The Strategic Sourcing Group is responsible for recommending for the approval by the Management Committee the long-term strategy and purchase decision for these items, negotiation and relationship with vendors with regard to these items, formulating and overseeing our purchasing policies, norms in respect of all items, evolving guidelines for vendor quality improvement, vendor rating and performance monitoring and undertaking company-wide initiatives such as e-sourcing and supply chain management/policies with respect to vehicle spare parts. We are also exploring opportunities for global sourcing of parts and components from lower cost countries, and have embarked on a vendor management program that includes vendor base rationalization, vendor quality improvement and vendor satisfaction surveys., 242954=We believe that our in-house product development capability, our subsidiary TDCV in South Korea, our association with Hispano in Spain, our joint ventures with Marcopolo of Brazil in India and with Thonburi in Thailand and our relationship with Fiat will enable us to expand our product range and extend our geographical reach.

We are currently developing a new truck platform., 11659=Indicate by check mark whether the registrant: (1)\u00a0has filed all reports required to be filed by Section\u00a013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2)\u00a0has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x\u00a0\u00a0Yes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a8\u00a0\u00a0No, 492607=Revenues from the domestic market for fiscal 2006 increased by 16.0% to Rs.198,172 million from Rs.170,883 million and revenues from markets outside India increased by 54.3% to Rs.42,443 million from Rs.27,504 million in 2005. This was primarily due to our continued focus on improving our presence in international markets, through expansion of both our automotive and non-automotive business. The revenues from markets outside India accounted for approximately 17.6% and 13.9% respectively, of our total revenue in fiscal 2006 and 2005. International business has increased in importance to us in recent fiscal years and we seek to continue to grow the proportion of revenues we draw from international operations., 567385=During fiscal 2007 and 2006 , the effective weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt was 4.84% and 4.60%\u00a0per annum, respectively., 505171=Our consolidated net income for fiscal 2006 was Rs.15,011 million, an increase of 13.2% from Rs.13,256 million in fiscal 2005.

Revenues from this segment increased by Rs.35,773 million, or 18.9%, to Rs.224,753 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005.

Prices of commodity items used in manufacturing automobiles, including steel, rubber, copper, and zinc, etc are on the rise. While we have been pursuing various cost reduction programs to partially offset these price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover any future cost increases in commodity products through cost-saving measures elsewhere or that we will be able to increase the selling prices of our products, which could materially and adversely impact our sales and results of operations., 479471=Domestic sales of vehicles produced by us during fiscal 2007 grew by 30.4%, crossing the half million vehicle sales mark in a year for the first time in our history. The increase was largely due to the continuing success of the Tata Ace, the launch of Indica facelift, Indica Xeta (1.2 litre), Indigo XL and Indigo DICOR during the fiscal year and also due to the successful implementation of the ban on overloading of trucks in India. International sales continued to grow during fiscal 2007 as a result of our successful entry into South Africa and increased focus on other traditional export markets, as well as the launch of MCVs in the South Korean market by TDCV. Continued focus on the Auto Financing business, following the merger of TFL with us, facilitated increased growth of this business.

VAT enables set-off from sales tax paid on inputs by traders and manufacturers against the sales tax collected by them on behalf of the government, thereby eliminating the cascading effect of taxation. Two main brackets of 4% and 12.5%, along with special brackets of 0%, 1% and 20%, have been announced for various categories of goods and commodities sold in the country. Central Sales Tax, however, continues to exist, although it is proposed to be abolished in a phased manner. Since its implementation, VAT has had a positive impact on us. Prior to the implementation of VAT, sales tax formed part of our total cost of material. However, following the implementation of VAT, because VAT paid on inputs can be set off against tax paid on outputs, a savings on our sales tax component results., 11144=If this report is an annual or transition report, indicate by check mark if the registrant is not required to file reports pursuant to Section\u00a013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0Yes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0x\u00a0\u00a0No, 554052=Capital expenditure aggregated Rs.25,277 million, Rs.10,734 million and Rs.9,163 million during fiscals 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Daimler Chrysler AG has kept its shareholdings steady, but its percentage shareholding has declined from 7.25% to 6.64% as a result of our new issuances of shares. Citibank N.A. as Depositary for our ADRs, has increased its shareholding from 7.12% to 10.97% because of the two-way fungibility of Depositary Receipts. Life Insurance Corporation of India Limited has increased its shareholding and has seen its shareholding percentage increase from 5.50% to 6.10%., 664480=The Audit Committee is comprised of the following three independent directors: V.

The effective tax rate during fiscal 2007 was 30.7% compared to 27.4% in fiscal 2006. Increase in tax rate is primarily on account of tax on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and a tax benefit recorded in fiscal 2006 on sale of shares of a subsidiary company. The increase was partially offset by higher tax benefit on research and development and tax free dividend income., 549160=Total shareholders\u0092 equity was Rs.91,369 million and Rs.81,016 million as of March\u00a031, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The increase was attributable to the conversion of outstanding convertible debt securities.

Despite an increase in interest rates during the latter half of fiscal 2007, our vehicle-financing registered a strong growth on the back of an increased focus in the business and strong vehicle demand during the fiscal year., 326050=over by the Government as part of the Government\u0092s nationalization program. Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS) is Asia\u0092s leading software services provider and the first Indian software firm to exceed sales of US$ 4 billion.

During fiscal 2006, HCM increased its stake in Telcon from 20% to 40% facilitating access to improved technology, overseas markets and increased manufacturing and component outsourcing opportunities for Telcon. Similarly, efficiencies derived from the acquisition of INCAT during fiscal 2006 helped increase the revenue growth of TTL., 429584=Strong economic growth, increased industrial activity and continued development of better road infrastructure contributed to a robust growth of the Indian automobile industry in fiscal 2007., 556081=We fund our short-term working capital requirements with cash generated from operations, overdraft facilities with banks, short and medium term borrowings from lending institutions, banks and commercial paper. The maturities of these short and medium term borrowings and debentures are generally matched to particular cash flow requirements.

Strong performance in passenger vehicles was facilitated by the lower excise duty on small cars announced in the Indian Union Budget of fiscal 2007 and the launch of new models/variants, where we have maintained our position as the second largest manufacturer in the Indian market. The performance of, 395614=Automotive operations is our most significant segment, accounting for 91.9% and 92.6%, respectively, of our total revenues before inter-segment eliminations and 89.5% and 94.7%, respectively, of our operating income before inter-segment eliminations for fiscal 2007 and 2006.

Tata Sons along with the Tata Sons promoted entities instituted a new corporate identity program to re-position itself to compete in a global environment. A substantial ongoing investment is planned to develop and promote a strong, well-recognized and common brand equity, which is intended to represent for the consumer a level of quality, service and reliability associated with products and services offered by the Tata Sons promoted entities. To implement these plans, Tata Sons Limited has undertaken a program by which consenting the Tata Sons promoted entities are required to pay a subscription fee to participate in and gain from the new Tata brand identity.

These calculations are made with reference to our non-consolidated Indian GAAP financial statements.

The agreement can be terminated by written agreement between the parties, by Tata Sons Limited upon our breach of the agreement and our failure to remedy the same, or by Tata Sons Limited upon providing six months notice for reasons to be recorded in writing. The agreement can also be terminated by Tata Sons Limited upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including liquidation.
