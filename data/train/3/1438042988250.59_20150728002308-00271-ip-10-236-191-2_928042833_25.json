This college has several different career paths that suit different interests. The only complaint I have is the availability of classes, the population is so big the availability can not suit everyone."

They are a very welcoming group that is willing to help in any way they can.

If you did not have the money to jump straight into a UC or CSU right after High School, a junior college like LMC is great at assisting students with programs that will help you pay for books, supplies, rent and transportation if you meet the criteria.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Campus Safety I think it's a pretty safe neighborhood, there are campus patrollers, but of course, one cannot be too careful. Clubs and Activities circle k etc. Great for these types of students -plan to transfer -that don't mind going to a small school before university Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus on a warm day, I like to sit outside the cafeteria under all the trees, on a relatively windy day, it's really comfortable and a lot more quiet tan inside the cafeteria. Bang for the buck it's pretty good. I like the campus, and some of my teachers are really good. What to do for fun if you're in a music class, you will have access to the practice rooms that are sound proof and have pianos... everything else depends on your creativity or resourcefulness for finding fun things to do. Food and Dining prefetch decent food, a litte pricey in my opinion, but the portions are good. Dorm",
