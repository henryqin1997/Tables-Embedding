By default, items are catenated with spaces, but if the first item contains the string 'SEPARATOR=<sep>', the separator '<sep>' is used. Items are converted into strings when necessary. Examples: ${str1} = Catenate Hello world ${str2} = Catenate SEPARATOR=--- Hello world ${str3} = Catenate SEPARATOR= Hello world => - ${str1} = 'Hello world' - ${str2} = 'Hello---world' - ${str3} = 'Helloworld' Comment *messages Displays the given messages in the log file as keyword arguments. This keyword does nothing with the arguments it receives, but as they are visible in the log, this keyword can be used to display simple messages. Given arguments are ignored so thoroughly that they can even contain non-existing variables. If you are interested about variable values, you can use the Log or Log Many keywords. Convert To Binary item, base=None, prefix=None, length=None Converts the given item to a binary string. The item, with an optional base, is first converted to an integer using Convert To Integer internally. After that it is converted to a binary number (base 2) represented as",
