After the party has progressed passed this point in game, he will no longer be there. Ogir-Yensa SandseaEdit WaresEdit [show] Contents The game has a mistake concerning Dyce: Before defeating Garuda at Tomb of Raithwall Dyce wears green clothes, but after defeating Garuda, Dyce suddenly wears dark clothes and appears with tattoos on his head. Also, if the party always ignores Dyce and never speaks to him, he has different dialogue when spoken to in Balfonheim. He is first encountered when the party is on their way across the Ogir-Yensa Sandsea, next to the Gate Crystal. Next he is seen in the Nam-Yensa Sandsea and after the party reaches the Tomb of Raithwall he will appear there. Dyce is lastly seen in the Balfonheim Port where he will stay for the rest of the game. Dyce (\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9, Daisu",
