    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{8953=This required course will introduce you to the bar exam, review material tested on the bar exam, and teach you important skills in reading, analyzing, and answering bar exam questions. The course uses a learn-by-doing approach. Written homework assignments include multiple choice questions and essay questions. These will be submitted, graded, and returned online before most classes and will then form the basis for class discussion and review. Students will also be assigned online video review. The course will refresh your recollection of selected topics within three of MBE subjects, Contracts, Evidence and Torts. Students will learn how the bar examiners test these topics and will learn how to study and to apply their knowledge to bar exam questions. The course is pass-fail, with the pass/fail determination based on 1) participation/ attendance and 2) performance. Students will receive feedback throughout the course. If a student fails as a result of performance, the student will receive a grade of incomplete and will be required to take the spring ALA 2 Course. Students will be given an initial assessment in August., 142503=The Small Business Clinic will provide selected students with the opportunity to handle legal matters for small business clients under the supervision of the professor. Students work on transactional legal matters that are typical in the start-up phase of a business. The goal of the clinic is to expose students to the methodology and mindset of business lawyering. Law students work with the entrepreneurs to identify the legal issues new businesses confront. Clinic students participate in weekly one-on-one meetings with the professor, meetings with clients (often in the evenings) and participation in walk-in legal assistance. The clinical component will involve client interviewing, assessment and intake, along with legal research, drafting, and counseling as the situation requires. In an effort to operate the clinic as close to an actual law firm as possible, students are required to maintain client billing records through use of the clinic?s time/document management software. Client work will require a minimum of 16 hours of work per week and other course commitments will require an additional four to five hours per week. Students enrolled in LAWS944 must also concurrently enroll in LAWS 945, a two-credit seminar, with their semester of fieldwork. Prerequisites: LAW 551 Business Organizations, Law 553 Evidence. Evidence may be taken concurrently with the Clinic. A student is required to be SJC Rule 3:03 eligible. The clinic is open to students who have successfully completed 28 hours of law studies. A student may not simultaneously enroll in more than one clinic, more than one externship, or a clinic and an externship. (This course satisfies 4 experiential learning credits.)Or (2 skills units and 2 writing units.), 41618=Selected students in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic work as student assistant district attorneys within the Hampden County District Attorney's Office. By court rule, students in the Clinic are authorized to practice in any District Court case, which includes a mix of both misdemeanors and felonies. Typical of the offenses litigated by students in the District Court are possession and/or distribution of controlled substances, domestic violence offenses including assault and battery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and violation of a restraining order, larceny, assault and battery on a police officer, and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. During the course of the semester, a student attorney will appear in three different sessions of the District Court: the arraignment session (in which students represent the Commonwealth in bail hearings), the motion session (in which students prepare and litigate oppositions to motions to suppress and motions to dismiss) and, ultimately, the trial session (in which a student prepare and litigate jury and jury-waived trials). This clinic allows students to gain substantial exposure over the course of the semester to the entire process of litigating a criminal case. Students enrolled in LAWS920 must also concurrently enroll in LAWS 921, a two-credit seminar, with their semester of fieldwork. Prerequisites: LAW 553 Evidence and LAW 706 Criminal Procedure Investigation. Enrollment is limited to selected third-year full time and forth-year part time students. No student may maintain outside legal employment while participating in this clinic. All students will be CORI/criminal records checked by the District Attorney's Office. A student is required to be SJC Rule 3:03 eligible. A student may not simultaneously enroll in more than one clinic, more than one externship, or a clinic and an externship. (This course satisfies 4 experiential learning credits.)Or(3 skills units and 1 writing unit), 47376=In this course, we will explore the constitutional rules that control the behavior of police officers when they investigate crime and prosecute criminal defendants. Specifically, this course will survey the impact of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments on police investigations and also analyze the ways in which constitutional guarantees of due process, equal protection, and trial by jury impact criminal prosecutions. To this end, this course will provide an overview of criminal procedure issues arising during police investigation, arrest, prosecution, trial and post-conviction NOTE: Students who take this course may NOT also take either Criminal Adjudication or Criminal Investigation. Although this course will touch on some of the topics in Criminal Procedure: Investigation and Criminal Procedure: Adjudication, not all of these subject areas will be reviewed. For this reason, this course is intended for students who do not intend to practice Criminal Law, but want an introduction to criminal procedure. Students planning to practice criminal law or who have a significant interest in the field should consider taking both the Criminal Procedure: Investigation and Criminal Procedure: Adjudication courses, which together provide a more in-depth study of criminal procedure law. (Students planning to enroll in Crim Pro Simulation in the Spring semester 2016 may enroll in this course to satisfy the prerequisite even if they have taken Crim Pro Adjudication.), 112324=Selected students work in the office of Community Legal Aid (CLA), a local non-profit organization charged with providing free civil legal services to low-income and elderly persons. Under the supervision of CLA attorneys, students assume primary professional responsibility for actual cases, including client interviews, counseling, case development, negotiation, and representation of clients in court and administrative proceedings. Students are expected to commit 16 hours per week to the fieldwork at CLA. Students enrolled in LAWS 916 must also concurrently enroll in LAWS 917, a one-credit seminar, with their semester of fieldwork. Prerequisites: Successful completion of LAWS 910 Legal Service Skills Seminar and LAW 553 Evidence. Evidence may be taken concurrently with the Clinic.
