            "This campus is not only beautiful but incredibly safe. I always felt at home and never worried about myself of my property while at this campus.",
            "UAFS offers an extensive array of 2 and 4 years degrees for an amazing price compared to most other 4 year programs.",
            "The UAFS campus offers many great opportunities for students to be involved in campus activities. The campus center offers student activities ranging from movies, games, and events almost nightly.",
            "Food is very reasonably priced as well as many options available for students. The dining area is easy to access and provides many options for payment. The dining area is also very well maintained.",
            "I am unfamiliar with dorm life. I lived off campus during my time on campus. I did get to see several of the dorm rooms and do know that the dorms are very nice, clean, and have great security.",
            "Instructors are very helpful to students and willing to provide one on one assistance if needed. Compared to other institutions I have had an easier time getting in to speak with instructors after class or during office hours.",
            "Arrive to class early because parking is limited close to campus.",
            "Very well laid out and campus friendly, especially for new students. The campus is very unintimidating for a first time college student. Classes are small and easy to locate."

Fill out the scholarship page during the summer of your senior since the deadlines are in October., 14558=This university is practically in our back yards! I am living at home, and drive everyday. The parking can be tight, but if you arrive around 7:30 for 8 am classes, you will have no problem. the tuition is about $2000 a semester, but with my band scholarship I pay around $1200 a semsester. If you are a music major, they practicially get a full ride. Bug your professors to get the information you need! You are a paying costomer at college., 17619=UAFS has a great program for medical and dentistry students. This year, they also told us that psychology was the most popular degree for the year 2010-2011. UAFS offers the most common degrees. And they do a great job at choosing the professors to teach in these fields., 257916=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 186439=Fayettville only being 45min away is a plus. Have not lived on campus yet but will attend fall of 2013. With the Arkansas river being a short drive from campus is awesome. Since they have the Big Bass Bonanza every summer which means great fishing.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Anyone in the medical field, education or computer based programs. Tips for prospective students Meet with your adviser often. Your adviser will be a lifeline if any questions or concerns may arise. He or she can also help you find degrees or clubs that will make your college life more enjoyable. Being an active member on campus is also very important. There are so many clubs and events that you will miss out on if you just show up to your classes and leave when they are over. Bang for the buck The tuition is cheaper than any other school I applied to in this area. It is practically nonexistent with all of the scholarships and grants available to students. Your Lions Card gives you access to the campus store, cafeteria, and many local businesses at discounted prices. You are also provided with a lot of bonuses already added into the tuition. Am enjoying being here The professors and fellow students take the time to actually notice your presence on campus. The atmosphere is really friendly throughout the entire school. The professors have given a great effort to making themselves available to students in and out of the classroom. The campus also",
