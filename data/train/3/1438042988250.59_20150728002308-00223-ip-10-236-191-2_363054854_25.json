Any changes to the template automatically update the service profiles created from the template. Updating template Service profiles created from an initial template inherit all the properties of the template. Service profiles created from an initial service profile template are bound to the template. However, changes to the initial template do not automatically propagate to the bound service profiles. If you want to propagate changes to bound service profiles, unbind and rebind the service profile to the initial template. Initial template Cisco UCS supports the following types of service profile templates: For example, if you need several service profiles with similar values to configure servers to host database software, you can create a service profile template, either manually or from an existing service profile. You then use the template to create the service profiles. If you need only one service profile with similar values to an existing service profile, you can clone a service profile in the Cisco UCS Manager GUI.",
