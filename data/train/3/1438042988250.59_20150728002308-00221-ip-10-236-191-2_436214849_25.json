    "textAfterTable": "Michitaka Kimura, Kanagawa JP Patent application number Description Published 20110291270 MANUFACTURING METHOD OF SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE, AND MOUNTING STRUCTURE THEREOF - A semiconductor device with improved quality and reliability is provided. In a UBM formed over an electrode pad located over a semiconductor substrate, the edge (end) of an Au film as an upper layer is located inside or in the same position as the edge (end) of a TiW film as a lower layer, which can suppress the formation of a suspended part in the Au film. This arrangement can prevent the occurrence of electrical short circuit between the adjacent pads due to the suspended part and the adhesion of the suspended part as foreign matter to the semiconductor substrate, thus improving the quality and reliability of the semiconductor device (semiconductor chip). 12-01-2011 20120098126 SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE AND MANUFACTURING METHOD THEREFOR - The joint reliability in flip chip bonding of a semiconductor device is enhanced. Prior to flip chip bonding, flux 04-26-2012 20140329476 ELECTRONIC DEVICE - A compact electronic device as a constituent element of a wireless communication system using a sensor. A first feature of the device is that a first semiconductor chip is bare-chip-mounted over a front surface of a first wiring board in the form of a chip and a second semiconductor chip is bare-chip-mounted over a second wiring board in the form of a chip.
