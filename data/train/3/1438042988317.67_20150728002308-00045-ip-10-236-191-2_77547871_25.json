This means that the XML values for these data types must adhere to the XML schema representation for dateTime. Therefore, a simple DATE string, 01-JAN-05, is invalid. XML schema defines dateTime as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss. Therefore, the correct DATE value is 2005-01-01T00:00:00. Values for these parameters must be specified using this format in the instance XML., 19311=Section 9.2.11, \"Specifying Polling Options\", 477894=Section 9.8.2.2.11, \"Adding a Connection-Instance\", 55966=Section 9.2.10.2, \"Update a Field in the Table (Logical Delete)\", 74829=Section 9.3.10, \"detectOmissions Feature\", 214122=Choose this operation to employ the sequencing table: last updated strategy. This polling strategy involves using a helper table to remember a last_updated value. A last_updated value of 2005-01-01 12:45:01 000, for example, means that every record last updated at that time or earlier has already been processed. Because many tables have rows with a last_updated or creation_time column maintained by triggers or the application, this strategy can often be used for noninvasive polling. No fields on the processed row ever need to be modified by the Oracle Database Adapter., 299491=Besides, the data types mentioned in the preceding table, alias data types are also supported. Alias data types are created by using the sp_addtype database engine stored procedure or the CREATE TYPE Transact-SQL statement (only for SQL Server 2005.) Note that the use of the Transact-SQL statement is the preferred method for creating alias data types. The use of sp_addtype is being deprecated., 56089=Section 9.2.10.3, \"Update a Sequencing Table\", 84188=When configuring true XA for third party drivers (that is, Microsoft SQL Server 2008, IBM DB2), see if the driver jars contain a class that implements javax.sql.XADataSource., 450274=Section 9.8.2.1.11, \"Monitoring Using the Fusion Middleware Control Console\", 93447=SQL Server 2008 table valued functions and CLR functions are not supported., 477790=Section 9.8.2.2.10, \"Creating a Data Source\", 55532=If you selected Perform an Operation on a Table, then you can skip ahead to the Section 9.2.12, \"Specifying Advanced Options.\"., 478004=Section 9.8.2.2.12, \"Testing using the File Adapter Service and SQL*Plus\", 19516=Section 9.2.13, \"Entering the SQL String for the Pure SQL Operation\", 91798=Using this feature, you can select a stored procedure (or stored function), enter its arguments, and perform a test execution to retrieve an actual row set. The Adapter Configuration Wizard then introspects the returned row set and generates a strongly typed XSD. You can enter arguments easily through the wizard. For example, you can enter numbers and strings directly, dates as literals (2009/11/11), and you can even enter structs like MYOBJ('a', 'b')., 478137=Section 9.8.2.2.13, \"Monitoring Using the Fusion Middleware Control Console\", 19204=Section 9.2.10, \"Choosing an After-Read Strategy\", 255734=SQL Server 2005 installs with Windows authentication as the default. Therefore, you do not log in with a user name and password; rather, your Windows user account either has privilege or does not. JDBC requires you to provide a user name and password., 206081=Choose this operation to employ the sequencing table: last-read Id strategy. This polling strategy involves using a helper table to remember a sequence value. The source table is not modified; instead, rows that have been read in a separate helper table are recorded. A sequence value of 1000, for example, means that every record with a sequence less than that value has already been processed. Because many tables have some counter field that is always increasing and maintained by triggers or the application, this strategy can often be used for noninvasive polling. No field on the processed row must be modified by the Oracle Database Adapter., 257369=Ensure that SQL Server Browser is running and that your SQL Server service has TCP/IP enabled and is listening on static port 1433. Disable dynamic ports. In SQL Native Client Configuration/Client Protocols, ensure that TCP/IP is enabled and that the default port is 1433., 55857=Section 9.2.10.1, \"Delete the Rows That Were Read\", 297628=XML (2005 only), 329675=Section 9.7.3.10, \"XSD Pruning Optimization\", 75254=Section 9.3.13, \"Doing Synchronous Post to BPEL (Allow In-Order Delivery)\", 472108=The default port is 1521., 346607=The nillable attribute is always set to true to allow the corresponding element in the instance XML to have a null value (for example, <X/> or <X></X>). In some cases, however, to pass an element such as this, which does have a null value, you must state this explicitly (for example, <X xsi:nil=\"true\"/>). The namespace, xsi, used for the nillable attribute, must be declared explicitly in the instance XML (for example, xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\")., 93727=Microsoft SQL Server 2008, 74977=Section 9.3.11, \"OutputCompletedXml Feature\", 75128=Section 9.3.12, \"QueryTimeout for Inbound and Outbound Transactions\", 450122=Section 9.8.2.1.10, \"Creating a DataSource in Oracle WebLogic Server Administration Console\", 19413=Section 9.2.12, \"Specifying Advanced Options\", 56331=Section 9.2.10.5, \"Update a Sequencing File\", 399672=Enter numbers and strings directly, dates as literals (for example, 2009/11/11), and structs as say MYOBJ('a', 'b')., 93677=Microsoft SQL Server 2005}",
