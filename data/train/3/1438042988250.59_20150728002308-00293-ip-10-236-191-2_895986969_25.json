            "The campus is very safe with on cite police officers. They are there until the night classes are over which is great because walking in a dark parking lot is a bit frightening.",
            "They have dances and lots of school clubs and activities to attend. They always have new events posted.",
            "They have an excellent cafe!! but the food, in my opinion is expensive and you're better off walking a few blocks to get a subway or hamburger.",
            "Hancock does not have dorms.",
            "Hancock is a perfect school to attend if you plan on transferring. But it is important to go in with a goal and have a plan of which classes you want to take and when. Its sad, but a lot of students get stuck taking classes they don't need.",
            "The teachers there know their information well. It is a friendly environment and easy to learn in. What I like is that the classes are small and it gives the teacher enough time to give there students individual attention."

(i.e. a bag of hot cheetos is $1.50) Dorm Life There aren't dorms--unless you sleep on a bench. Academic Rigor As a wise professor/counselor told me, You can go to the richest, top 'elite' schools and not learn anything. You can be a graduate from the best schools. All that will give you is titles. but it's how much dedication and effort you put into learning and advancing your knowledge to make it applicable to your life. You can do that even at the 'low quality' schools. If a teacher is giving easy grades, the true hard-working student will find a way to go beyond. However, I believe every school has both good and bad teachers. Here at Hancock, there are easy teachers, as well as plenty of teachers you wish You wouldn't have taken, since many think all teachers are easy. Tips for prospective students Speak with counselors. Don't just talk to them in a routine like you are accustomed to in high school. They can be used much more than just to",
