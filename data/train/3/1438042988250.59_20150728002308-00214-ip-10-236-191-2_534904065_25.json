            "Re: 2007 NAIAS: Jeep Trailhawk Concept Vehicle Actually, the Patriot is very close to the Cherokee in size, weight, and appearence. But, it appears DC will only be offering the Patriot with a 2 liter gasser in the US, whereas the exports will be offered with six speed manual and turbo diesel. I wish DC would quit wasting money on these concept vehicles and ludicrous advertising campaigns and instead invest the same time and money into a viable diesel program offered with six speed manual tranny. What's it gonna take?",
