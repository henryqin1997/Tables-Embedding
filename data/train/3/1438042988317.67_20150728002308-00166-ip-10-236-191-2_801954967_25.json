    "textBeforeTable": "A mapping of a single WSDL document (together with any imports or includes) will always result in a single instance of the Description class. However, there can be multiple individuals of the class Description in a knowledge base that contains the information from multiple WSDL documents. The core WSDL specification does not consider the case of combining multiple independent WSDL documents and it does not mandate that independent documents consistently describe components with the same name. This is, however, an assumption when combining the RDF representation of multiple WSDL documents. The normative WSDL RDF mapping does not consider merging multiple differing definitions of a component with the same name, but some possible resulting problems are pointed out in section 4.2. Note that since we do not model element declarations and type definitions further than just the QNames, we do not reference them from the Description instance. This also means that while all WSDL component models implicitly contain all XML Schema simple type definitions, the RDF mapping does not show them. It is possible that if an RDF mapping is created for XML Schema, instead of referencing the QNames, a future version of this WSDL RDF mapping can use direct pointers to the XML Schema component designators for the element declarations and type definitions. The top-level WSDL component \u2014 Description \u2014 is mapped to a single instance of the class Description, which uses the properties interface, binding and service to",

WSDL interfaces can extend other WSDL interfaces, which is indicated by the property extends. Interfaces may have operations and faults, represented as instances of the InterfaceOperation and InterfaceFault classes, and each pointed to with the properties interfaceOperation and interfaceFault, respectively. Interfaces, operations and faults each have a name, which is a QName. The namespace IRI part of this QName is present before the fragment ID of the component identifier, and the local name is represented in the RDF form as a literal value of the property rdfs:label. There are a number of properties applicable to InterfaceOperation instances (corresponding to the properties of the WSDL Interface Operation component): messageExchangePattern property points to an instance of the class MessageExchangePattern and thus indicates the message exchange pattern (MEP) used by this operation; there can be only one MEP on one operation operationStyle property points to an instance of the class OperationStyle and indicates that the operation adheres to the given style; there can be multiple operation styles on a single operation interfaceMessageReference and interfaceFaultReference properties point to instances",
