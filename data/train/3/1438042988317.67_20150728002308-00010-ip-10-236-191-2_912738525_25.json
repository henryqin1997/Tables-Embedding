            "I always feel very safe on campus. Campus Safety wants to do everything in their power to keep the students safe and comfortable on campus. Each officer is very approachable and friendly around campus.",
            "There is no Greek life but if boys wants a fraternity feel they should make sure to live in the dorm Villa Maria or Christie Hall.",
            "There are lots of choices for clubs ranging from gardening to politics to sports and more. The activities are fun too and include many things such as service opportunities, the arts, crafts, outdoor adventures, competitions and more.",
            "As a hard working student there is a lot of opportunity to grow and be recognized and supported in your studies. The school is making a lot of renovations to make the facilities and programs more valuable for the students.",
            "The Anchor is a great place to go and have gelatto after dinner or in between classes. The bell tower on campus rings every 15 minutes with really random tunes that are fun to listen to. There is free personal training at the gym, make sure to use it!",
            "The school is expensive but it is very good about giving large scholarships. The campus is beautiful and the facilities for labs and the like are very nice but most everything else does not seem to live up to the price. There are quite a few extra fees that are unnecessary.",
            "It is really fun to go to the weekly Pilots After Dark events on Saturdays that have fun activities late at night. Downtown is a blast if you like to shop, club, and see shows like cheap stand up comedy. Portland is also a great place to do outdoor activities such as hiking and biking.",
            "The food quality is excellent and there is quite a bit of variety. However Bon Appetite is the monopoly on campus and prices are very unreasonable. If you have a meal plan then it is fine but paying on your own is not advisable.",
            "Dorm life can be a lot of fun if you make an effort to get to know the people through out the building and participate in the planned events. The coed and all boys dorms are very fun and active but the all girls dorm should be avoided. Quiet hours and privacy are highly respected.",
            "The academic rigor depends on the major but hard work and responsibility is expected from every student. Engineering, nursing and other science majors work very hard for many long hours while business and other majors do not have to work as much. Most everyone is very focused on studying so there is a supportive and encouraging academic environment.",
            "This is a great school but it is known for its academics and is definitely not a party school. You must be prepared to deal with a fair amount of stupid rules and a slight lack of social activities on campus but if you know how to make your own fun Portland is the best city to do it in. If you enjoy soccer then this is a great school but if you want a very active sports community choose a different college.",
            "The University of Portland is a great place to meet life longs friends and receive a first class education. The rules and structure can often be smothering and unfair but overall the goal of the school and administration is to help the students in every way that they can. The city is a fun and exciting place to become independent and confident."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The academics here are incredible. The professors really do care about their students. I'm a rather shy person but i feel oddly comfortable around these professors. In fact I actually had my spanish teacher recommend the possibility of a major in communications. In this college its all about where you can go with your skills and interests and how the professors can help you get there.

Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid to ask question, whether it be to a neighbor, professor, hall director, etc. Joining clubs and other activities help you to meet other people which make living on campus a lot easier. Take advantage of the free events (ex. movies, coffee, field trips, etc.) because youre paying for the steep tuition.",
