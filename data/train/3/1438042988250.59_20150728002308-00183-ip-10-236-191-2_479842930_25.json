The present invention also provides the method for continuous fractional determination of HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol or total cholesterol in the same sample in the same system, as well as a reagent kit for use therein. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY FIG. 5 shows the correlation between the concentration of LDL cholesterol obtained by the method of the invention (designated by Method of the invention in the figure) and the concentration of LDL cholesterol obtained by the comparative method (designated by Comparative method in the figure). HDL cholesterol)\u2212(concentration of neutral fat) LDL cholesterol) =(concentration of total cholesterol)\u2212(concentration of (concentration of Friedewald formula: On the other hand, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and neutral fat were measured using Determiner L TC (Kyowa Medex Co., Ltd.), Determiner L HDL-C (Kyowa Medex Co., Ltd.) and Determiner L TG (Kyowa Medex Co., Ltd.), respectively, which are all commercially available kits. Then the concentration of LDL cholesterol was determined in accordance with the following Friedewald formula. A correlation coefficient between the concentration of LDL cholesterol obtained by the method of the present invention and the concentration of LDL cholesterol calculated according to the Friedewald formula was found to be 0.9767. After 4 \u03bcL of each sample was mixed with 300 \u03bcL of the first",
