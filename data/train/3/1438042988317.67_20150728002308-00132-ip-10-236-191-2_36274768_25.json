An \"interference fit\" is also called a \"press fit\", where the head tube is smaller than the cup/bearing. The cup is pressed into the head tube with force. A \"slip fit\" allows the bearing to be installed and removed by hand, with no pressing required. In a slip fit, the outside diameter (OD) of the bearing is smaller than the inside diameter (ID) of the frame. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Steering columns may be either 1-inch or 1-1/8 inch in this standard. The bearings are a slip fit into the frame. The common 1-1/8 inch standard has a bearing outside diameter of nominally 41.8mm with a 45-degree bearing seat. Campagnolo\u00ae brand bearings use a caged ball bearing inside the bearing unit. The unit can be pulled apart to be cleaned and regreased. Some other brands use a non-serviceable bearing, which are simply replaced, not serviced. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
