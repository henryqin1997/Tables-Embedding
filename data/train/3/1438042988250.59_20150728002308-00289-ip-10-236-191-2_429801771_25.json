            "COMPLIANCE MECHANISM - A method and apparatus for a mobile tail support vehicle moving a swing tail cargo door of a swing tail aircraft. A mobile tail support apparatus is engaged to the swing tail cargo door on the swing tail aircraft. The swing tail cargo door is moved from a first position to a second position using the mobile tail support apparatus. Vertical reaction occurs to vertical loads on the swing tail cargo door during movement of the swing tail aircraft by the mobile tail support apparatus. Loads on a hinge and/or swing tail cargo door are reduced during the movement of the swing tail cargo door using the mobile tail support apparatus.",
            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MOVING A SWING TAIL CARGO DOOR ON AN AIRCRAFT - A computer implemented method, apparatus, and computer usable program code for a mobile tail support control system. An apparatus comprises a data processing system, an output device, a set of load sensors, a set of position sensors, and a computer program product executing on the data processing system. The output device is capable of generating signals for managing movement of a mobile tail support apparatus. The set of load sensors may be coupled to the data processing system and may be capable of detecting loads associated with a swing tail cargo door. The set of position sensors are coupled to the data processing system and detect a position of the mobile tail support apparatus relative to the swing tail cargo door. The computer program product may receive information from the set of load sensors and the set of position sensors and generate signals to manage the mobile tail support apparatus."

Kraft, Las Vegas, NV US Patent application number Description Published 20140106323 REPRESENTATIONS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL STRUCTURES FOR TREATMENT SIMULATION - Representations of physiological structures for thermal treatment simulation. Training operators of the treatment devices by physically illustrating thermal profiles on organs, tissue, and nerves in real time may advantageously provide an understanding of heating and/or cooling effects. An experimenter may witness the thermal effects of lesion creation (e.g., RF lesion creation) rather than just monitoring a thermocouple temperature and assuming end-organ/tissue/nerve effects. 04-17-2014 Matthew B. Kraft, Salt Lake City, UT US Patent application number Description Published 20110269713 BRYOSTATIN ANALOGUES AND METHODS OF MAKING AND USING THEREOF - Described herein are tricyclic macrolactones. The macrolactones have a high binding affinity for PKC. The compounds described herein can be used in a number of therapeutic applications including cancer and Alzheimer's prevention and treatment. The compounds described herein can also treat memory loss. Also described herein are methods for producing macrolactones. The methods permit the high-yield synthesis of macrolactones in fewer steps and with a higher degree of substitution and specificity. 11-03-2011 Maureen E. Kraft, Hudson, MA US Patent application number Description Published 20100070562 BUSINESS PROCESS ENABLEMENT OF ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS - Business process enablement of electronic documents is provided. A method includes populating an electronic document supporting structured and unstructured content.",
