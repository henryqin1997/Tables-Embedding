The previous record had been held by 6.3 YPC by Jon Vaughn (from 1989-1990)., 155502=The NCAA total offense records are dominated by prolific passers. Those records appear to be unattainable by Denard: 732 yards for a single game (David Klingler, Houston vs. Arizona State, 1990); 5,976 for a season (B.J. Symons, Texas Tech, 2003); 16,910 for a career (Timmy Chang, Hawaii, 2000-2004)., 284789=According to the stats I've been able to find, Robinson is indeed out front with 30 all-purpose touchdowns. On a per-game basis, Denard at 2.73 per game is second only to Tom Harmon, who scored 23 touchdowns (including a kickoff return and an interception return) over 8 games in 1940, for an average of 2.88., 427040=Did you know that Michigan is averaging 521.8 yards per game in total offense, higher than any other team in Big Ten history? (Second place belongs to Penn State's 1994 team, which averaged 512.7 yards per game.) Even if you take out the 72 extra yards Michigan gained in the three overtimes against Illinois, Michigan is averaging 514.7 yards per game., 325693=Seven quarterbacks have achieved this milestone multiple times: Brad Smith (thrice), Colin Kaepernick (twice and counting), Vince Young (twice), Pat White (twice), Beau Morgan (twice), Joe Webb (twice), and Joshua Cribbs (twice). Only two people have joined the 1000/1000 club as freshmen: Brad Smith of Missouri, and Joshua Cribbs of Kent State. Air Force leads the overall list with five different QBs, in six different seasons, in the 1000/1000 club. (It is interesting that an instrument of American capitalist imperialism, the U.S. Air Force Academy, is the premier exponent of communist football.), 148712=The NCAA FBS (I-A) single-season record is 63 touchdowns, by Colt Brennan of Hawaii in 2006 (58 passing, 5 rushing). The per-game record is 5.0 in 1990, by David Klingler of Houston (55 TDs in 11 games)., 345481=As noted above, Denard is also on pace to annihilate John Navarre's single-season total offense record of 3,240 in 2003 (Denard has 3,767 as of today, and projects to an astounding 4,452 yards over 13 games)., 422020=Denard's 2010 passing efficiency is currently 157.7; his career efficiency (including last year) is 149.1, which would be a Michigan record if he keeps that pace. Here are Michigan's pass efficiency records:, 317554=For a single game, the Michigan record is 347 by Ron Johnson in 1968 against Wisconsin; the Big Ten record is 377 by Anthony Thompson of Indiana in 1989 against Wisconsin; the NCAA FBS record is 406 by LaDainian Tomlinson of TCU in 1999 against UTEP., 304746=Before we move on to the show, I want to say one thing: Bret Bielema is a coward. Trashing Denard as a \"pretty\" player who they \"would never recruit.\" I seriously doubt you would talk smack about Comrade Denard if you were playing him in 2011 and 2012. Here's hoping that Michigan and Wisconsin meet in the Big Ten championship game in one of those years. Your plodding style may be working well for you this year: but get back to us when you win a mythical national championship with it. The inevitablitiy of the Hegelian dialectic means that we will get there before you do., 96366=Denard finished the 2010 season with 1,702 yards rushing and 2,570 passing, making him the first person in college football history\u2014at any level\u2014with more than 1,500 yards rushing and 2,500 yards passing in a single season., 300082=Tim Tebow is the only player to have both thrown and run for 20 touchdowns: in 2007, he threw for 32 and ran for 23. (Dan LeFevour of Central Michigan threw for 27, ran for 19, and caught 1 in 2007.) Cameron Newton may join this 20/20 club in 2010; he has thrown for 21 TDs and run for 17, with three games left., 265618=This year's team is on pace to demolish the old Michigan total offense record of 466.9, set in 1992, when Gary Moeller roamed the sidelines, barking orders to Elvis Grbac, Desmond Howard, and Tyrone Wheatley., 162673=Denard's 2010 passing efficiency was 149.6; his career efficiency (including last year) is 144.0, which is within reach of a Michigan record. Here are Michigan's pass efficiency records:, 149203=Tim Tebow and Cameron Newton are the only players to have both thrown and run for 20 touchdowns: in 2007, Tebow threw for 32 and ran for 23, and Newton threw for 30 and ran for 20 in 2010. (Dan LeFevour of Central Michigan threw for 27, ran for 19, and caught 1 in 2007.), 261138=At the end of 2009, here were some of the other Michigan passing records. Denard could break some of the completion percentage records (Tate broke one as well):, 365126=Dynamic offenses have been few and far between in the postwar era. The 1976 Bo Schembechler team, led by Rick Leach and Rob Lytle, scored 36.0 points per game, and owns the rushing season record with 345.3 yards per game. The aforementioned 1992 team averaged 35.9 points; and the 2003 team averaged 35.4., 246682=The Michigan career record for most touchdowns scored is held by Yost-era legend Willie Heston, with 69 from 1901-1904 (the Michigan record book lists Heston at 72 TDs, which is incorrect according to my game-by-game tally). The Michigan record for most all-purpose touchdowns is held by Chad Henne, who threw for 87 and ran for 3 (for a total of 90) from 2004-2007. If Denard plays through his senior season, there is a realistic chance that he could break Henne's record., 177416=Roundtree's mark wouldn't even make the top ten all-time in the Big Ten: the Big Ten record is 301 by Chris Daniels of Purdue against MSU in 1999; the NCAA record is 405 by Troy Edwards of Louisiana Tech against Nebraska in 1998., 155238=The Big Ten single-game total offense record is 585 yards by Dave Wilson of Illinois, vs. Ohio State in 1980. The Big Ten single-season total offense record had been 4,189 yards by Drew Brees of Purdue in 2000., 214730=The list below of 1000/1000 members is sorted this list by rushing yards. Cameron Newton and Colin Kaepernick have also reached the 1000/1000 mark this season. I've also added 2010 season totals for Taylor Martinez, who may also get there. Newton is also likely to join Denard as a 1500-yard rusher., 167621=Also, Denard is one of 5 quarterbacks in NCAA history to record 5 consecutive 100-yard rushing games (the others are Ricky Dobbs of Navy in 2009, Joe Webb of Alabama-Birmingham in 2009, Brian Madden of Navy in 1999, and Beau Morgan of Air Force in 1995). No one has done it 6 times in a row., 106561=For a career, the Michigan record is held by Mike Hart (5,040 yards, 2004-2007); the Big Ten record is held by Ron Dayne (7,125 yards, 1996-1999); the NCAA FBS record is also held by Ron Dayne, but they list it as 6,397 yards. (Herschel Walker of Georgia holds the record for a 3-year career at 5,259 yards, set from 1980-1982.), 102711=Denard currently holds the Michigan and Big Ten records for rushing yards by a quarterback in a single game: 258 vs. Notre Dame. The NCAA FBS record is 308, on 22 attempts, by Stacey Robinson of Northern Illinois, against Fresno State, on Oct. 6, 1990. The previous Michigan single-game record was held by another #16, Steve Smith, who ran for 147 yards on four carries against Minnesota in 1983., 149494=The Michigan career record for most touchdowns scored is held by Yost-era legend Willie Heston, with 69 from 1901-1904 (the Michigan record book lists Heston at 72 TDs, which is incorrect according to my game-by-game tally). The Michigan record for most all-purpose touchdowns is held by Chad Henne, who threw for 87 and ran for 3 (for a total of 90) from 2004-2007. If Denard plays through his senior season, it's possible that he could break Henne's record., 341326=Denard already owns the Michigan single-game total offense record (502 yards against Notre Dame). In fact, Denard has broken the old Michigan single-game total offense record four times this year, with games of 502, 494, 383, and 381 yards. (The previous record was 368 by John Navarre against Iowa in 2003.) Against Illinois and Wisconsin, Denard almost broke this record again, gaining 367 and 360 yards respectively: giving him six of the seven highest totals in Michigan history., 200159=Denard currently has 1,643 rushing yards in 12 games. This projects to 1,780 over a 13-game schedule. He owns the NCAA FBS (I-A) record, previously set by Beau Morgan of Air Force in 1996 with 1,494 yards. The Big Ten record was previously in the hands of Antwaan Randle-El in 2000 with 1,270 yards. Denard has destroyed the previous Michigan record for QB rushing yards in a season: 674 by Steve Smith in 1981., 304234=Also, Rob Lytle, R.I.P. Lytle was the featured back in the great 1976 ground attack, which at 4,144 yards and 345.3 per game, remains the most prolific rushing offense in recorded Michigan history. Lytle held the Michigan single-season rushing record for 11 years, with 1,469 yards, and the career record for five years, with 3,317, before those marks were topped by Jamie Morris and Butch Woolfolk, respectively., 118139=Seven quarterbacks have achieved this milestone multiple times: Brad Smith (thrice), Colin Kaepernick (thrice including 2010), Vince Young (twice), Pat White (twice), Beau Morgan (twice), Joe Webb (twice), and Joshua Cribbs (twice). Only two people have joined the 1000/1000 club as freshmen: Brad Smith of Missouri, and Joshua Cribbs of Kent State. Air Force leads the overall list with five different QBs, in six different seasons, in the 1000/1000 club. (It is interesting that an instrument of American capitalist imperialism, the U.S. Air Force Academy, is the premier exponent of communist football.), 99702=Here are the top 5 rushers in the country in 2010, sorted by yards gained:, 148935=The FBS single-season record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback is 27, by Ricky Dobbs of Navy in 2009 (in 14 games). The season record for most touchdowns scored (i.e., excluding TD passes thrown) is 39, by Barry Sanders in 1988 over 11 games., 388693=Michigan's career record is held by Rick Leach (1975-1978) at 2,176 yards: a record Denard will break this year, at his current pace. Denard needs to average 136 rushing yards a game to take this title. (Guys like Leach and Steve Smith must salivate at what they could have done in the offense of Comrade Rodriguez.) The Big Ten record is Antwaan Randel El's (1998-2001) at 3,895 yards. The NCAA FBS record is held by Pat White (2005-2008) at 4,480 yards., 97302=Denard lost his hold of the Michigan career pass-efficiency record with a minimum of 200 attempts, as the Ohio State game brough him down to 146.2. The current record is 148.1 by Elvis Grbac (from 1989-1992), though Elvis had the benefit of a certain Heisman Trophy-winning receiver. Denard's 146.2 mark is also on pace for fourth all-time in the Big Ten, though he needs 300 completions to qualify for that record (he currently has 169)., 352901=Denard's 2010 passing efficiency is currently 158.2; his career efficiency (including last year) is 150.4, which would be a Michigan record if he keeps that pace. Here are Michigan's pass efficiency records:, 345743=The Big Ten single-game total offense record is 585 yards by Dave Wilson of Illinois, vs. Ohio State in 1980. The Big Ten single-season total offense record is 4,189 yards by Drew Brees of Purdue in 2000, which is well within Denard's reach. Denard has to average 211 yards of total offense in his remaining games to pass Brees; he is currently averaging 343., 376254=Prefatory Verbiage \u2022\u00a0New This Week \u2022 Week in Review \u2022 Record of the Week \u2022 QBs as Rushing Champions \u2022 QB Rushing, Game \u2022 QB Rushing, Season \u2022 QB Rushing, Career \u2022 Rushing (Any Position) \u2022 200/200 Club \u2022 1000/1000 Club \u2022 Total Offense \u2022 Total Offense Per Play \u2022 Passing Efficiency \u2022 Other M Passing \u2022 Other M Rushing \u2022 Team Offense \u2022 Miscellaneous Records \u2022 Standard Disclaimers \u2022 Acknowledgments \u2022 Comments, 252526=The Big Ten single-game total offense record is 585 yards by Dave Wilson of Illinois, vs. Ohio State in 1980. The Big Ten single-season total offense record is 4,189 yards by Drew Brees of Purdue in 2000, which is well within Denard's reach. Denard has to gain 231 yards of total offense in the bowl game to pass Brees; he is currently averaging 330., 285442=Here is the table, sorted by touchdowns per game, with a cutoff of 1.60. Remarkably, the 1901 team had three separate players score at that pace:, 366753=As most of you know, against Illinois, Roy Roundtree destroyed a 44-year-old Michigan single-game receiving record, by gaining 246 yards (on 9 catches with 2 TDs). The old record was set in 1966, when Jack Clancy gained 197 yards against Oregon State. (Roundtree's mark wouldn't even make the top ten all-time in the Big Ten: the Big Ten record is 301 by Chris Daniels of Purdue against MSU in 1999; the NCAA record is 405 by Troy Edwards of Louisiana Tech against Nebraska in 1998.), 378881=New to this week's Almanack is a \"Miscellaneous Records\" section to highlight records broken by other players this year, such as Roy Roundtree's single-game receiving mark set against Illinois. I also added a passage in the Disclaimers section about college football scoring conventions prior to 1912., 98135=A quarterback has never led the NCAA FBS in rushing yards over a single season. In 1937, the first year in which the NCAA kept official football statistics, Colorado halfback Byron \"Whizzer\" White led the nation in rushing with 1,121 yards, along with 475 passing yards. (If that wasn't enough, White also went to Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, played in the NFL for Pittsburgh and Detroit, served in World War II during which he was awarded two Bronze Stars, came back and graduated from Yale Law School, and was appointed by John F. Kennedy to the Supreme Court of the United States.), 104682=Michigan's career record is held by Rick Leach (1975-1978) at 2,176 yards: a record Denard could break this weekend against Western Michigan. Denard needs 123 yards in the WMU game to take this title. The Big Ten record is Antwaan Randel El's (1998-2001) at 3,895 yards. The NCAA FBS record is held by Pat White (2005-2008) at 4,480 yards., 300414=The Michigan career record for most touchdowns scored is held by Yost-era legend Willie Heston, with 69 from 1901-1904 (the Michigan record book lists Heston at 72 TDs, which is incorrect according to my game-by-game tally). The record for most all-purpose touchdowns is held by Chad Henne, who threw for 87 and ran for 3 (for a total of 90) from 2004-2007. If Denard plays through his senior season, there is a realistic chance that he could break Henne's record. (EDIT: I changed this from the previous version, which incorrectly cited Heston as the all-purpose career leader.), 299315=(EDIT: I added Bob Chappuis' 1947, Ron Johnson's 1968, and Bruce Shorts' 1901 seasons to the list, and added the offensive positions that each player filled. Note that Shorts scored 17 TDs as an offensive lineman: now those were the days!), 168029=Michigan averaged 488.7 yards per game in total offense in 2010, ninth-highest in Big Ten history. (First place belongs to Penn State's 1994 team, which averaged 512.7 yards per game.) If you take out the 72 extra yards Michigan gained in the three overtimes against Illinois, Michigan averaged 483.2 yards per game., 116399=Johnny Bright, a halfback from Drake, was the first member of the 1000/1000 Club, the same year Reds Bagnell joined the 200/200 Club. In 1951, Wilbanks Smith, a racist defensive tackle from Oklahoma A&M (later Oklahoma State), deliberately broke Bright's jaw, permanently damaging his football career. The incident led the NCAA to mandate the usage of face masks, and earned the 1952 Pulitzer Prize for the photographers who documented the assault. Drake temporarily withdrew from the Missouri Valley Conference to protest the fact that the conference didn't discipline Smith for the attack., 397329=I've also added 2010 season totals for Cam Newton, Taylor Martinez, and Colin Kaepernick, three dual-threat quarterbacks who are likely to surpass 1000/1000 this year (Kaepernick already did so in 2008 and 2009, and Newton already has for 2010)., 194535=Denard remains on pace to break the Michigan single-season total offense per play record, with 8.0 yards per play as of this week. The current record is held by Drew Henson, who recorded 7.9 YPP in 2000., 134127=According to the stats I've been able to find, Robinson is indeed out front with 32 all-purpose touchdowns in 2010, more than any player in the 121-year history of Michigan football. On a per-game basis, Denard at 2.46 per game is third only to two seasons from Tom Harmon, who scored 23 touchdowns (including a kickoff return and an interception return) over 8 games in 1940, for an average of 2.88. (Harmon also scored 2.50 touchdowns per game in 1939, though over 8 games compared to Denard's 13.) The only asterisk is that I don't have information on passing touchdowns for the Yost-era teams., 176923=As most of you know, against Illinois, Roy Roundtree destroyed a 44-year-old Michigan single-game receiving record, by gaining 246 yards (on 9 catches with 2 TDs). The old record was set in 1966, when Jack Clancy (pictured) gained 197 yards against Oregon State., 309703=Denard extended his hold on to the Michigan career pass-efficiency record with a minimum of 200 attempts, at 150.4. The previous record was 148.1 by Elvis Grbac (from 1989-1992), and Elvis had the benefit of a Heisman Trophy-winning receiver. Denard's 150.4 mark is also on pace for third all-time in the Big Ten, though he needs 300 completions to qualify for that record (he currently has 161)., 346626=As with total offense records, these will be tough for Denard to keep pace with, and his performances against Big Ten opponents have left him further behind the pace. Through Saturday, Denard has 3,767 yards of total offense in 459 plays, for an average of 8.2. This would be a Michigan single-season record: the current record is held by Drew Henson, who in 2000 gained 2,140 yards on 270 plays for an average of 7.9., 372365=Thanks to tf (Michigan rushing single-game record) and danieljpaul (Denard's season totals) for corrections. H/T to tubauberalles and enlightenedbum for tracking down the FBS single-game QB rushing record. Raoul and UM in VA persuaded me to post the total offense numbers, and pointed out Denard's ridiculous per-play stats, which I also added to the diary. Trebor pointed out that we should keep an eye on the impressive seasons of Taylor Martinez and Cam Newton. U of M in TX helped identify a few updating errors. Raoul also suggested putting in the team offense stats. Hillhaus pointed out that I should discuss the pre-1912 scoring conventions., 92676=Prefatory Verbiage \u2022 Bowls in Review \u2022 Record of the Week \u2022 QBs as Rushing Champions \u2022 QB Rushing, Game \u2022 QB Rushing, Season \u2022 QB Rushing, Career \u2022 Rushing (Any Position) \u2022 200/200 Club \u2022 1500/2500 Club \u2022 1500/1500 Club \u2022 1000/1000 Club \u2022 All-Purpose TDs \u2022 Total Offense \u2022\u00a0 Total Offense Per Play \u2022 Passing Efficiency \u2022 Other M Passing \u2022 Other M Rushing \u2022 Team Offense \u2022 Miscellaneous Records \u2022 Standard Disclaimers \u2022 Acknowledgments \u2022 Comments, 252278=As noted above, Denard has annihilated John Navarre's single-season total offense record of 3,240 in 2003 (Denard has 3,959 as of today, and projects to an astounding 4,289 yards over 13 games)., 103269=Denard gained 1,731 rushing yards in 13 games in 2010.\u00a0 He owns the NCAA FBS (I-A) record, previously set by Beau Morgan of Air Force in 1996 with 1,494 yards. The Big Ten record was previously in the hands of Antwaan Randle-El in 2000 with 1,270 yards. Denard has destroyed the previous Michigan record for QB rushing yards in a season: 674 by Steve Smith in 1981., 97084=Denard still holds (for now) the Michigan career yards-per-carry record with a minimum of 200 attempts, with 6.3 YPC. The previous record was 6.3 YPC by Jon Vaughn (from 1989-1990)., 163934=At the end of 2009, here were some of the other Michigan passing records. Denard broke one of them in 2010 (Tate broke one as well):, 380500=Denard's season rushing total now stands at 1,417 yards, 77 yards short of Beau Morgan's FBS record of 1,494, set in 1996. If Denard gains 83 against Wisconsin, he will become the first major-college player in history to both rush and pass for 1,500 yards in a single season. If he passes for 10 yards against the Badgers, he will also become the first member of the 1500/2000 club., 284096=So I had to go back and look at individual season statistics to compile the data. I actually went through the game-by-game accounts of the 1901-1905 seasons from the Michigan Alumnus in order to get accurate information about touchdown statistics in the Fielding Yost Point-A-Minute era, and reviewed old NCAA research on pre-1937 touchdown statistics. It's possible that there are other pre-WWII players that I've missed., 262922=At the end of 2009, here were the other relevant Michigan rushing records. On average yards per carry, he owns one of the single-game records Michigan tracks, but is surprisingly far from the other ones (not that that couldn't change in a hurry). The single-season and career records are within reach:, 96829=Notably, with 313 yards of total offense against Mississippi State, Denard eclipsed Drew Brees\u2019 10-year-old Big Ten record for total offense in a single season, with 4,272 yards (Brees gained 4,189 in 2000 for Purdue)., 165672=At the end of 2009, here were the other relevant Michigan rushing records. On average yards per carry, Denard one of the single-game records Michigan tracks, but is surprisingly far from the other ones (not that that couldn't change in a hurry). The single-season and career records were within reach, but are obviously uncertain now:, 107009=Denard is the only player in FBS history to gain 200 yards rushing and 200 yards passing twice\u2014in regular-season games. To me this is a silly distinction: who cares if it was done in the regular season or a bowl game? If anything, Vince Young's performance in the 2005 Rose Bowl against USC is even more remarkable, given that that USC team is considered one of the most dominant teams of the modern era. Wake me up when Denard gets his third 200/200 game. (He did go for 191/190 against Penn State.), 412141=Denard already owns the Michigan single-game total offense record (502 yards against Notre Dame). In fact, Denard has broken the old Michigan single-game total offense record four times this year, with games of 502, 494, 383, and 381 yards. (The previous record was 368 by John Navarre against Iowa in 2003.) Against Illinois, Denard almost broke this record again, gaining 367: giving him five of the six highest totals in Michigan history., 379349=Denard was 13 of 21 passing for 188 yards, 1 TD, and 2 interceptions, for a rating of 128.97, well below his averages. Even worse, he ran for only 68 yards on 22 carries, for a season-worst YPC of 3.09. Once again, the postgame commentary on the Purdue game failed to highlight what a remarkable season Comrade Denard is having. Unnoticed on Saturday was the fact that Denard set Michigan's single-season record for total offense, breaking John Navarre's 2003 mark of 3,240 yards., 155076=As noted above, Denard has annihilated John Navarre's single-season total offense record of 3,240 in 2003 with 4,272 in 2010., 259878=Denard's 2010 passing efficiency is currently 152.9; his career efficiency (including last year) is 146.2, which is within reach of a Michigan record. Here are Michigan's pass efficiency records:, 105240=The NCAA FBS per-game career record is 109.1 yards by Stacey Robinson of Northern Illinois, achieved from 1988-1990 over 25 games., 87637=4. Hackett has told players that the search will likely be over after Christmas break. The NFL regular-season schedule ends on December 28. The 49ers could make the playoffs, throwing a wrench in this schedule, but Hackett's confidence in that timeline is telling., 174673=The Fielding Yost \"point-a-minute\" teams averaged 50.5, 58.5, 47.1, 56.7, and 38.1 points per game from 1901 to 1905. Fritz Crisler's 1947 national championship team of Bob Chappuis and Bump Elliott, nicknamed the \"Mad Magicians,\" averaged 39.4. (The official Michigan record book erroneously lists the 1947 average as second-highest in school history; it is missing the performances of 1901, 1903, 1904, and 1905.), 414992=As noted above, Denard is also on pace to annihilate John Navarre's single-season total offense record of 3,240 in 2003 (Denard has 3,407 as of today, and projects to an astounding 4,245 yards over 13 games)., 283483=In the comments section of the Wisconsin edition of my Almanack of Broken Records, Comrades Raoul and BigHouseInmate pointed out that Denard may have broken the single-season Michigan record for all-purpose touchdowns with 30 (16 passing, 14 rushing). Michigan does not actually track this particular statistic; instead, M tracks touchdowns scored (i.e., who actually carried the ball into the endzone). That record is held by Al Herrnstein, who scored 26 touchdowns in 1902., 397059=As noted above, Denard joined the 1000/1000 club on his first drive against Iowa. As noted above, he should easily become the first member of the 1500/1500 and 1500/2000 clubs. The list below of 1000/1000 members is sorted this list by rushing yards., 265233=Michigan is averaging 500.9 yards per game in total offense, second-highest in Big Ten history? (First place belongs to Penn State's 1994 team, which averaged 512.7 yards per game.) If you take out the 72 extra yards Michigan gained in the three overtimes against Illinois, Michigan is averaging 495.0 yards per game, which would be fifth all-time., 280099=Thanks to Comrade tf (Michigan rushing single-game record) and danieljpaul (Denard's season totals) for corrections. H/T to tubauberalles and enlightenedbum for tracking down the FBS single-game QB rushing record. Comrades Raoul and UM in VA persuaded me to post the total offense numbers, and pointed out Denard's ridiculous per-play stats, which I also added to the diary. Trebor pointed out that we should keep an eye on the impressive seasons of Taylor Martinez and Cam Newton. Comrade U of M in TX helped identify a few updating errors. Raoul also suggested putting in the team offense stats. Hillhaus pointed out that I should discuss the pre-1912 scoring conventions. Raoul and BigHouseInmate suggested I look into Michigan's all-purpose touchdown records, which ended up being a lot of fun. And finally, thanks to all of you for enjoying the Almanack each week. That's what makes it worth my while., 118765=The list below of 1000/1000 members is sorted this list by rushing yards. Cameron Newton and Colin Kaepernick also reached the 1000/1000 mark in 2010., 325445=There are 30 quarterbacks (and one halfback, Johnny Bright of Drake) in FBS who have run and thrown for 1000 yards in the same season. Of these, none have both run and passed for 1500 yards (the rushing record for QBs is 1,223)., 193806=Though his average keeps trickling down, Denard still holds the Michigan career yards-per-carry record with a minimum of 200 attempts, with 6.4 YPC. The previous record had been held by 6.3 YPC by Jon Vaughn (from 1989-1990)., 307628=New to this week's Almanack is a section on the 1500/1500 club, which did not exist until Saturday afternoon., 315043=Denard currently holds the Michigan and Big Ten records for rushing yards by a quarterback in a single game: 258 vs. Notre Dame. The NCAA FBS record is 308, on 22 attempts, by Stacey Robinson of Northern Illinois, against Fresno State, on Oct. 6, 1990.\u00a0, 253383=As with total offense records, these will be tough for Denard to keep pace with, and his performances against Big Ten opponents have left him further behind the pace. Through Saturday, Denard has 3,959 yards of total offense in 495 plays, for an average of 8.0. This would be a Michigan single-season record: the current record is held by Drew Henson, who in 2000 gained 2,140 yards on 270 plays for an average of 7.9., 90951=They say that the five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. I think I'm in stage 4. It's taken me this long to publish a post I'd written after the bowl game in January, and that's because Denard has a game tomorrow and all the stats will change, obviously., 133381=In order to look at all-purpose touchdowns, I had to go back and look at individual season statistics to compile the data. I actually went through the game-by-game accounts of the 1901-1905 seasons from the Michigan Alumnus in order to get accurate information about touchdown statistics in the Fielding Yost \"point-a-minute\" era, and reviewed old NCAA research on pre-1937 touchdown statistics. It's possible that there are other pre-WWII players that I've missed., 387238=Denard currently has 1,417 rushing yards in 10 games. This projects to 1,842 over a 13-game schedule. He owns the Big Ten record, previously set by Antwaan Randle-El in 2000 with 1,270 yards, and has destroyed the previous Michigan record for QB rushing yards in a season: 674 by Steve Smith in 1981., 150985=Denard already owns the Michigan single-game total offense record (502 yards against Notre Dame). In fact, Denard has broken the old Michigan single-game total offense record four times this year, with games of 502, 494, 383, and 381 yards. (The previous record was 368 by John Navarre against Iowa in 2003.) Against Illinois and Wisconsin, Denard almost broke this record again, gaining 367 and 360 yards respectively: giving him six of the seven highest totals in Michigan history., 214099=Seven quarterbacks have achieved this milestone multiple times: Brad Smith (thrice), Colin Kaepernick (thrice including this year), Vince Young (twice), Pat White (twice), Beau Morgan (twice), Joe Webb (twice), and Joshua Cribbs (twice). Only two people have joined the 1000/1000 club as freshmen: Brad Smith of Missouri, and Joshua Cribbs of Kent State. Air Force leads the overall list with five different QBs, in six different seasons, in the 1000/1000 club. (It is interesting that an instrument of American capitalist imperialism, the U.S. Air Force Academy, is the premier exponent of communist football.), 175128=Dynamic offenses have been few and far between in the postwar era. The 1976 Bo Schembechler team, led by Rick Leach and Rob Lytle, scored 36.0 points per game, and owns the rushing season record with 345.3 yards per game. The aforementioned 1992 team averaged 35.9 points; and the 2003 team averaged 35.4., 315463=Denard currently has 1,538 rushing yards in 11 games. This projects to 1,818 over a 13-game schedule. He owns the NCAA FBS (I-A) record, previously set by Beau Morgan of Air Force in 1996 with 1,494 yards. The Big Ten record was previously in the hands of Antwaan Randle-El in 2000 with 1,270 yards. Denard has destroyed the previous Michigan record for QB rushing yards in a season: 674 by Steve Smith in 1981., 117388=When Bright graduated from Drake in 1951, he held the NCAA career total offense record, with 5,903 yards: a record that stood for 15 years. It took three decades for another player to join the 1000/1000 Club. Tragically, Bright died at the age of 53 of a massive heart attack., 305440=Prefatory Verbiage \u2022\u00a0New This Week \u2022 Week in Review \u2022 Record of the Week \u2022 QBs as Rushing Champions \u2022 QB Rushing, Game \u2022 QB Rushing, Season \u2022 QB Rushing, Career \u2022 Rushing (Any Position) \u2022 200/200 Club \u2022 1500/1500 Club \u2022 1000/1000 Club \u2022 Total Offense \u2022 Total Offense Per Play \u2022 Passing Efficiency \u2022 Other M Passing \u2022 Other M Rushing \u2022 Team Offense \u2022 Miscellaneous Records \u2022 Standard Disclaimers \u2022 Acknowledgments \u2022 Comments, 201628=Michigan's career record is held by Rick Leach (1975-1978) at 2,176 yards: a record Denard could break this year, at his current pace. Denard needs 182 yards in the bowl game to take this title. (Guys like Leach and Steve Smith must salivate at what they could have done in the offense of Comrade Rodriguez.) The Big Ten record is Antwaan Randel El's (1998-2001) at 3,895 yards. The NCAA FBS record is held by Pat White (2005-2008) at 4,480 yards., 134761=Here is the table, sorted by touchdowns per game, with a cutoff of 1.60. Remarkably, the 1901 team had three separate players score at that pace:, 107962=Pictured at right is Penn halfback Francis \"Reds\" Bagnell, 1950 Heisman Trophy runner-up and great-uncle to MGoComrade Dandaman. Bagnell was the first member of the 200/200 club. It took 36 years for a second player to accomplish the feat., 194068=Denard lost his hold of the Michigan career pass-efficiency record with a minimum of 200 attempts, as the Ohio State game brough him down to 146.2. The current record is 148.1 by Elvis Grbac (from 1989-1992), though Elvis had the benefit of a Heisman Trophy-winning receiver. Denard's 146.2 mark is also on pace for fourth all-time in the Big Ten, though he needs 300 completions to qualify for that record (he currently has 169)., 415254=The Big Ten single-game total offense record is 585 yards by Dave Wilson of Illinois, vs. Ohio State in 1980. The Big Ten single-season total offense record is 4,189 yards by Drew Brees of Purdue in 2000, which is well within Denard's reach. Denard has to average 261 yards of total offense in his remaining games to pass Brees; he is currently averaging 341., 326316=The list below of 1000/1000 members is sorted this list by rushing yards. I've also added 2010 season totals for Cam Newton, Taylor Martinez, and Colin Kaepernick, three dual-threat quarterbacks who are likely to surpass 1000/1000 this year (Kaepernick already did so in 2008 and 2009, and Newton already has for 2010). Newton is also likely to join Denard as a 1500-yard rusher., 150179=Here is the team photo of the all-time great team of 1901, courtesy of the Bentley Historical Library. Al Herrnstein is the right-most player in the front row. Neil Snow is the second from the left in the middle row. Willie Heston is right-most in the middle row. Fielding Yost is in the center of the back row. The \"501-0\" football that captain Hugh White is holding reflects the fact that this picture was taken before the team beat Stanford 49-0 in the inaugural Rose Bowl game of 1902. The lopsided score so disappointed Rose Bowl officials that they didn't hold a second Rose Bowl game until 1916., 168365=Either way, the 2010 offense demolished the old Michigan total offense record of 466.9, set in 1992, when Gary Moeller roamed the sidelines, barking orders to Elvis Grbac, Desmond Howard, and Tyrone Wheatley., 105504=For a single game, the Michigan record is 347 by Ron Johnson (pictured) in 1968 against Wisconsin; the Big Ten record is 377 by Anthony Thompson of Indiana in 1989 against Wisconsin; the NCAA FBS record is 406 by LaDainian Tomlinson of TCU in 1999 against UTEP., 97777=Denard also just barely missed out on the Michigan single-season total offense per play record, with 7.8 yards per play in 2010. The record is held by Drew Henson, who recorded 7.9 YPP in 2000., 318952=Much has been made of the fact that Denard is the only player in FBS history to gain 200 yards rushing and 200 yards passing twice in regular-season games. To me this is a silly distinction\u2014who cares if it was done in the regular season or a bowl game? If anything, Vince Young's performance in the 2005 Rose Bowl against USC is even more remarkable, given that that USC team is considered one of the most dominant teams of the modern era. Wake me up when Denard gets his third 200/200 game. (He did go for 191/190 against Penn State.), 117889=Today, there are 30 quarterbacks (and one halfback) in FBS who have run and thrown for 1000 yards in the same season. Other than Denard, none have both run and passed for 1500 yards (the previous rushing record for QBs was 1,494)., 187368=Prefatory Verbiage \u2022\u00a0New This Week \u2022 Week in Review \u2022 Record of the Week \u2022 QBs as Rushing Champions \u2022 QB Rushing, Game \u2022 QB Rushing, Season \u2022 QB Rushing, Career \u2022 Rushing (Any Position) \u2022 200/200 Club \u2022 1500/2000 Club \u2022 1500/1500 Club \u2022 1000/1000 Club \u2022 All-Purpose TDs \u2022 Total Offense \u2022\u00a0 Total Offense Per Play \u2022 Passing Efficiency \u2022 Other M Passing \u2022 Other M Rushing \u2022 Team Offense \u2022 Miscellaneous Records \u2022 Standard Disclaimers \u2022 Acknowledgments \u2022 Comments, 155938=As with total offense records, Denard could not keep up his early 2010 pace, and his performances against Big Ten opponents that year left him further behind the pace. Through the bowl game, Denard had 4,272 yards of total offense in 547 plays, for an average of 7.8. This fell just shy of a Michigan single-season record: the current record is held by Drew Henson, who in 2000 gained 2,140 yards on 270 plays for an average of 7.9., 98769=In 2010, Denard barely failed to become the first quarterback in history to finish the season as the NCAA rushing champion by yards gained. He gained 1,702 yards on the ground, 29 yards behind LaMichael James., 388075=The NCAA FBS record is 1,494 by Beau Morgan of Air Force in 1996. This record is easily within reach. Denard only has to average 26 rushing yards a game over the rest of the\u00a0 season to break the NCAA FBS record., 381445=Denard continues to hold on to the Michigan career pass-efficiency record with a minimum of 200 attempts, at 149.1. The previous record was 148.1 by Elvis Grbac (from 1989-1992), and Elvis had the benefit of a Heisman Trophy-winning receiver. Denard's 149.1 mark is also on pace for third all-time in the Big Ten, though he needs 300 completions to qualify for that record (he currently has 145)., 161926=As you can see in the table, for a single season (minimum 3,000 yards), the record is 9.2 by Colt Brennan (Hawaii, 2006). For a career (minimum 7,500 yards) it's 8.7 by Sam Bradford (Oklahoma, 2007-2009)., 213850=Today, there are 30 quarterbacks (and one halfback) in FBS who have run and thrown for 1000 yards in the same season. Other than Denard, none have both run and passed for 1500 yards (the previous rushing record for QBs is 1,494)., 380902=Despite his relatively poor numbers against Illinois, Denard maintained possession of the Michigan career yards-per-carry record with a minimum of 200 attempts, with 6.5 YPC. The previous record had been held by 6.3 YPC by Jon Vaughn (from 1989-1990)., 193305=Our Comrade from Deerfield Beach is 230 yards away from setting the Big Ten single-season total offense record, currently held by Drew Brees with 4,189 yards in 2000. (Denard's 2010 per-game average is 329.9.) Denard currently sits fifth in the Big Ten's modern era in this category., 231339=According to the stats I've been able to find, Robinson is indeed out front with 30 all-purpose touchdowns, more than any player in the 121-year history of Michigan football. On a per-game basis, Denard at 2.50 per game is second only to Tom Harmon, who scored 23 touchdowns (including a kickoff return and an interception return) over 8 games in 1940, for an average of 2.88. (Harmon also scored 2.50 touchdowns per game in 1939, though over 8 games compared to Denard's 12.) The only asterisk is that I don't have information on passing touchdowns for the Yost-era teams., 381190=However, with his sloppy performance against Purdue, Denard lost possession of Michigan's single-season YPC record. Before Saturday, he was at 7.4 YPC for the year; today, he's at 6.0, well below Tyrone Wheatley's 7.3 mark set in 1992., 182495=Thanks to Comrade tf (Michigan rushing single-game record) and danieljpaul (Denard's season totals) for corrections. H/T to tubauberalles and enlightenedbum for tracking down the FBS single-game QB rushing record. Comrades Raoul and UM in VA persuaded me to post the total offense numbers, and pointed out Denard's ridiculous per-play stats, which I also added to the diary. Trebor pointed out that we should keep an eye on the impressive seasons of Taylor Martinez and Cam Newton. Comrade U of M in TX helped identify a few updating errors. Raoul also suggested putting in the team offense stats. Hillhaus pointed out that I should discuss the pre-1912 scoring conventions. Raoul and BigHouseInmate suggested I look into Michigan's all-purpose touchdown records, which ended up being a lot of fun. And finally, thanks to all of you for enjoying the Almanack each week of the 2010 season. That's what made it worth my while. Good bye and good luck., 316741=Michigan's career record is held by Rick Leach (1975-1978) at 2,176 yards: a record Denard will break this year, at his current pace. Denard needs to average 144 rushing yards a game to take this title. (Guys like Leach and Steve Smith must salivate at what they could have done in the offense of Comrade Rodriguez.) The Big Ten record is Antwaan Randel El's (1998-2001) at 3,895 yards. The NCAA FBS record is held by Pat White (2005-2008) at 4,480 yards., 192504=Denard is 175 yards short of tying Tim Biakabutuka's Michigan single-season rushing record of 1,818 yards, set in 1995. If he manages to stay healthy for an entire game, this record will certainly be within reach. (His 2010 per-game average is 136.9.) He currently sits fifth in Michigan's modern era in single-season rushing yards: the only backs ahead of him are Biakabutuka, Anthony Thomas, Jamie Morris, and Chris Perry. If Denard gains 100 yards in the bowl game, he will have ten 100-yard games on the season, tying a Michigan record held by Jamie Morris., 308192=Denard set his first NCAA record: rushing yards by an FBS (I-A) quarterback for a single season, with two games left. (FWIW, the all-division record is 1,844 yards by Jayson Foster of I-AA powerhouse Georgia Southern in 2007.), 310136=Denard remains on pace to break the Michigan single-season total offense per play record, with 8.2 yards per play as of this week. The current record is held by Drew Henson, who recorded 7.9 YPP in 2000., 132796=What is interesting is that we actually do have game-by-game accounts of touchdowns scored going back to the beginnings of Michigan football in 1879. As a result, Michigan does track touchdowns scored on an all-time basis, and not just for the modern era. The all-time Michigan record for touchdowns scored is held by Al Herrnstein, who scored 26 touchdowns in 1902., 246374=Tim Tebow and Cameron Newton are the only players to have both thrown and run for 20 touchdowns: in 2007, Tebow threw for 32 and ran for 23, and Newton has thrown for 28 and run for 20, with one game left. (Dan LeFevour of Central Michigan threw for 27, ran for 19, and caught 1 in 2007.), 357921=Did you know that Michigan is averaging 514.6 yards per game in total offense, higher than any other team in Big Ten history? (Second place belongs to Penn State's 1994 team, which averaged 512.7 yards per game.) If you take out the 72 extra yards Michigan gained in the three overtimes against Illinois, Michigan is averaging 508.1 yards per game, which would be second all-time., 88517=Even at 2:1 odds, decadent capitalists ought to take the bet that Harbaugh is coming to Michigan. The facts above make it extremely unlikely that any other outcome will take place.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Here are the top 5 rushers in the country in 2010, sorted by yards gained: On a yards-per-game basis, James won the title with 144.3 (Denard fell to fourth with 130.9, behind James, Connecticut's Jordan Todman, and WKU's Bobby Rainey). Personally, I find the YPG statistic to be arbitrary: should Denard be punished because the Bowling Green game was a rout and he was pulled, and LaMichael James be rewarded because he was suspended for one game for pleading guilty to harrassing his ex-girlfriend? FWIW, on a yards-per-carry basis, Denard is well ahead of James. In 2010, Denard barely failed to become the first quarterback in history to finish the season as the NCAA rushing champion by yards gained. He gained 1,702 yards on the ground, 29 yards behind LaMichael James. A quarterback has never led the NCAA FBS in rushing yards over a single season. In 1937, the first year in which the NCAA kept official football statistics, Colorado halfback Byron \"Whizzer\" White led the nation in rushing with 1,121 yards, along with 475 passing yards. (If that wasn't enough, White also went to Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, played in the NFL for Pittsburgh and Detroit, served in World War II during which he was awarded two Bronze Stars, came back and graduated from Yale Law School, and was appointed by John F. Kennedy to the Supreme Court of the United States.) Quarterbacks",
