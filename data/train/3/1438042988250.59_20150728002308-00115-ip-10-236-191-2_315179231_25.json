This is a replacement unit with the 5 screw holes (round plate). This is a standard in the aftermarket. We used this on our early style fuel tanks (for about 5 years) until we made the change to the in-tank fuel pump design\u00a0 in 2006. Now we use a 16 hole (square plate) design. The plate is different but the sender is the same. This sender will work with a stock Early Bronco fuel gauge or any aftermarket fuel gauge that requires a ohm range from 10 to 70, meaning that if you test your fuel gauge, you should get around 10 ohms when the tank is full and around 70 ohms when it is empty.\u00a0, 29836=C:\u00a0 Ford truck Lightning (GT40) 351W/5.8L (1993-1996) This manifold combo will fit under the stock hood but is hard to find and expensive due to the fact that they are Ford high performance parts., 60022=11-11015, 16073=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SPEED DENSITY 86-95: Is just fine for the guy that wants to put in a nice stock 5.0L or 5.8L motor but doesn't want to do any motor upgrades. Speed density is basically a fuel system that follows a pre-programmed table. When the vehicle is running at 55 mph at 2000 rpm's, a pre-determined amount of fuel comes out of the injector, so you need to run all stock components., 29381=A:\u00a0 Ford car 5.0L (1986-1998) This manifold combo comes on the Mustang, Cougar, LTD, Thunder bird and will work on the Bronco like it was made for it., 22191=First you need to have the correct computer.

    "textBeforeTable": "These electric fuel tank selector valves replace the old manual tank selector under your seat for easy, trouble-free operation. The 3-port valve is the solution for carbureted vehicles or can be used with a transfer pump to move fuel from the side tank to the main tank. The 6-port valve is the answer to the dual tanks dilemma for EFI-equipped vehicles, as it switches both the supply and return lines simultaneously. Best of all, either can be easily wired to the existing fuel gauge selector switch on your dash, so you can switch the fuel gauge between tanks at the same time you switch tanks for fuel delivery.
