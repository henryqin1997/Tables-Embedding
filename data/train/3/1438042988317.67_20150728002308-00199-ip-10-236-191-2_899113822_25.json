            "Very top notch. Blue lights are everywhere and the police station has always been full of friendly and helpful staff members. There are also safety escort buses and vans that run at night, you can call them and they will pick you up where ever you are and bring you right to your destination.",
            "I am currently involved in the English Society and Art History Society. There are so many clubs on campus that will match something you interest! There is equestrian club, anime club, there will always be something that you can find enjoyable with people who share what you like.",
            "Great for students that are going to school for a great educational experience and to network with other students who have the same interests.",
            "You definitely get what you are paying for. There is an academic achievement center where you can get help for any school work, a writing studio where you can get essays evaluated, and even an IT support if you are having any problems! They even have a career services office where you can go to find your major, find a career and get resume support. All of these resources are included in your fees, and are definitely worth your money!",
            "Program committee puts on so many fun events! They do trips to fun outings (such as Providence Place and Salem to Blue Man Group) and events on campus like Bingo!",
            "There are so many good food halls on campus. Flynn Dining Commons and Bears Den are where I generally eat, and the food is great!",
            "I am a commuter, but the halls are very clean and have great staff. The RA's have always been friendly to me when I have visited.",
            "Very good and challenging academics. You can find so many classes that are interesting and fulfilling to helping you achieve your goals!",
            "It is in your best interest to get in your FAFSA in on time as well as all other paperwork involving your admission and financial aid. Also, be proactive in your experience! If you keep up with your school work and get involved on campus your time at Bridgewater will be beyond what you expected.",
            "Bridgewater State is a very top of the line school with many student opportunities available. I have met so many educators who have been helpful throughout my experience. I know that Bridgewater State is going to put me on the right path to my career!"

Along with feeling safe during the days, they also have a number of Safety Vans that are available from 7 :00 p.m until 3:00 a.m that is only a phone call away and will pick you up and drop you off wherever you need to go within the campus., 11466=Most of the dorms on campus are decent. With the newer dorms being better, but they are also harder to get in to. The school is also building a brand new dorm that will open the Fall of 2013. The rooms are a decent size, but only two of the dorms have air conditioning to make sure you bring a fan!, 33313=The food is absolutely terrible and all the dining halls close before 7:30, except for crimson, which is overpriced dining-dollar dependent.}",

I always feel safe walking around campus, even late at night. There are 'blue lights' all around campus that you press the emergency button on and the police will be there in seconds. BSU has it's own police department so they can be anywhere on campus in under a minute. We also have a safety escort system that you call anytime between 7pm-3am and they will come and pick you up anywhere on campus and then drop you off at your destination for free. There are also student security officers in the dorms between 7pm-3am that check students back when they enter a dorm and they also sign in students guests so if anything where to go wrong it is all on the computer. Overall I think Bridgewater is a great on safety standards. Greek Life",
