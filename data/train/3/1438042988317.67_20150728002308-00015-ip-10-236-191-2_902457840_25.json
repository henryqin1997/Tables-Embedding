After visiting the campus in October I knew right away that this is where I wanted to further my education. The staff is super friendly, and the campus makes you feel like it's been waiting for you all this time., 29137=Sand volleyball, anyone? If it gets too cold just head to the student union or go hang out in other people's dorms. But if you don't mind spending money, Belmar isn't too far away and there's lots of shops and a movie theater., 168531=Being just down the block from the Belmar shopping center is a plus for anyone who likes to shop. It also has movie theater and a ice skating rink in the winter months. There are several parks nearby that are good for running around and playing sports. A lot of people have season passes at Copper Mountain/Winter Park, so snowboarding and skiing on weekends is a popular activity. The volleyball courts on campus are a popular hangout spot, but I've heard rumors that those might be taken out soon :-(. The Student Union has board games, a pool table, and a ping-pong table. With no class on Fridays, students have a lot of free time on the weekends., 30670=Don't freak out if you apply late! I didn't have all of my paperwork in 'til the July before school started and I still made it., 189983=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Students who desire a very personal school and a Christian lifestyle as the main focus will love Colorado Christian University. Those especially interested in Theology will get the best experience from CCU. It is a place for anyone wishing to grow spiritually and make lasting connections, as well as learn to get involved. Tips for prospective students As mentioned before, CCU has many opportunities and there is a lot of pressure to get involved. So, prospective students be warned that one must say no to many things or become exhausted from doing too much, especially during the freshman year. There is also a 180 hour ministry hour requirement for four-year students. 45 hours can be completed on campus, but the rest is done off-campus. Thus, prospective students should have an idea of what they want to get involved in and start as soon as possible to fulfill these hours so there is no crunch in the junior and senior year. Bang for the buck CCU is very expensive. It has great apartments although they can be a little rough around the edges. There is a lot of support for the on-campus community with budgets for clubs, housing, and help with missions. For the money I spend on cafeteria food however, there should be more variety",
