Add 3 MHz to the frequency for each channel (1-12) to obtain the repeater input frequency. The portable radios are 16-channel Motorola Saber radios.\u00a0 The portables' channels 1-8 are repeated county police channels 1-8 and the portables' channels 9-16 are talk-around (\"direct\") for county police channels 1-8. County police mobile radios are Motorola Spectra radios.\u00a0 These radios have both repeated and talk-around (\"direct\") channels for each of the 12 channels below. There are no separate channel numbers for talk-around on the mobile radios per se; repeater/direct is indicated by a letter following the channel number on the mobile radios' display (e.g., channel \"11R\" and \"11D\").\u00a0 The mobiles also have a \"scan\" mode which allows officers to monitor the other channels.
