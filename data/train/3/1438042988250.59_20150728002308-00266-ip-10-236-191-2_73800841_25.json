The metric is arbitrary and typically is assigned by a network administrator. Any single link can have a maximum value of 64, and path links are calculated by summing link values. Maximum metric values were set at these levels to provide the granularity to support various link types while at the same time ensuring that the shortest-path algorithm used for route computation is reasonably efficient. Three optional IS-IS metrics (costs)-delay, expense, and error-are not supported by the ONS 15454. IS-IS maintains a mapping of the metrics to the quality of service (QoS) option in the CLNP packet header.

    "textBeforeTable": "Table 13-1: General ONS 15454 IP Troubleshooting Checklist ONS 15454 IP addressing generally has eight common scenarios or configurations. Use the scenarios as building blocks for more complex network configurations. Table 13-1 provides a general list of items to check when setting up ONS 15454 nodes in IP networks. IP Addressing Scenarios The ONS 15454 SOCKS (network proxy protocol) proxy server can control the visibility and accessibility between CTC computers and ONS 15454 element nodes. ONS 15454s can be connected to Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) networks so that ONS 15454 network information is automatically communicated across multiple LANs and WANs. Static routes can be created to enable connections among multiple CTC sessions with ONS 15454s that reside on the same subnet. Different IP functions and protocols can be used to achieve specific network goals. For example, Proxy Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) enables one LAN-connected ONS 15454 to serve as a gateway for ONS 15454s that are not connected to the LAN. IP subnetting can create multiple logical ONS 15454 networks within a single Class A, B, or C IP network. If you do not subnet, you will only be able to use one network from your Class A, B, or C network. They can be connected to LANs through direct connections or a router. ONS 15454s can",

IP Scenario 6: Using OSPF shows an OSPF example.) To enable multiple CTC sessions among ONS 15454s residing on the same subnet. In Figure 13-6, one CTC residing on subnet 192.168.1.0 connects to a router through interface A. (The router is not set up with OSPF.) ONS 15454s residing on different subnets are connected through Node 1 to the router through interface B. Because Nodes 2 and 3 are on different subnets, proxy ARP does not enable Node 1 as a gateway. To connect to the CTC computer on LAN A (subnet 192.168.1.0), you must create a static route on Node 1. You must also manually add static routes between the CTC computer on LAN A and Nodes 2 and 3 because these nodes are on different subnets.
