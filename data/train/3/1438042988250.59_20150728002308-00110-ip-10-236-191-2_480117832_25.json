After 30 minutes, the locks of hair are then rinsed, washed with a standard shampoo and then dried. At the time of use, each dye composition is mixed with an equal amount of an oxidizing composition consisting of a 20 volumes aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (6% by weight) with a pH of about 3.",
