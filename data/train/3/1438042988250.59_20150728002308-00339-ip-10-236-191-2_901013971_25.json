            "The faculty here respect the students and have high expectations. High expectations are what have provided Springfield College with such a great reputation in the New England region.",
            "Spend a weekend on campus to fully understand what the student life is like. A simple 2 hour tour will not do the school justice. I suggest choosing a weekend filled with student activities and sporting events to embrace how the students support one another.",
            "A school embodied in its mind, body, and spirit culture. The faculty and staff here at the school embrace the opportunity to help one another and provide the best outlook for its students. The student body is very active in supporting its schools colors and participating in local community activities."

Join clubs, try out for sports, do intramurals. There are so many opportunities on this campus. Take advantage of them! Bang for the buck Tuition is going up here as it is everywhere in a not-so-good economy. However, the college is great at helping with financial aid, much financial aid is available, and the college gives out a lot of financial aid to deserving students. I applied to 8 colleges and none of the other 7 compared to the amount of financial aid I received from Springfield College. Am enjoying being here This is a smaller-sized school but not too small. I know many people on campus",
