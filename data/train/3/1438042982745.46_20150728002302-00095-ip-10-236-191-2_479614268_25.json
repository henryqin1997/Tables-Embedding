    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{5955=Detailed protocols for data analysis of Affymetrix microarrays and extensive documentation of the sensitivity and quantitative aspects of the method have been described (D. J. Lockhart, Nature Biotech. 14:1675, 1996). The Affymetrix GeneChip MU6500 set was derived from selected genes and ESTs from the Aug. 15, 1996 release of GeneBank. Briefly, each gene is represented by the use of \u02dc20 perfectly matched (PM) and mismatched (MM) control probes. The MM probes act as specificity controls that allow the direct subtraction of both background and cross-hybridization signals. The number of instances in which the PM hybridization signal is larger than the MM signal is computed along with the average of the logarithm of the PM:MM ratio (after background subtraction) for each probe set. These values are used to make a matrix-based decision concerning the presence or absence of an RNA molecule. All calculations are performed by Affymetrix software. To determine the quantitative RNA abundance, the average of the differences representing PM minus MM for each gene-specific probe family is calculated, after discarding the maximum, the minimum, and any outliers beyond three standard deviations. For example, to calculate fold changes (FC) between data sets obtained from young (y) vs. old (o) mice, the following formula was used: FC = SI o - SI y the \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e smallest \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e of \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e either \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e SI y \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e or \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e SI o + 1 \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e if \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e SI o \u2265 SI o \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e or \ue89e \u2003 - 1 \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e if \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e SI o < SI y}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{46523=Lee, et al., supra, 2000 describes the comparison between cDNAs isolated from neocortex tissue for the same three groups of mice described above. Lee, et al., supra, 2000 disclose that of the 6347 genes surveyed, 63 (1%) displayed a greater than 1.7-fold increase in expression levels with aging in the neocortex, whereas 63 genes (1%) displayed a greater than 2.1-fold increase in expression in the cerebellum. Functional classes were assigned and regulatory mechanisms inferred for specific sets of alterations (see Tables 5-10). Of these, 20% (13/63), and 33% (17-51) could be assigned to an inflammatory response in the neocortex and cerebullum, respectively. Transcriptional alterations of several genes in this category were shared by the two brain regions, although fold-changes tended to be higher in the cerebellum, perhaps due to reduced tissue size and/or reduced heterogeneity at the cellular level. These transcriptional alterations include the microglial and macrophage migration factor Mps1 and the Cd40L receptor, which is a mediator of the microglial activation pathway. Also induced was Lysozyme C and beta(2) microglobulin which are markers of inflammation in the human CNS. Interestingly, a concerted induction of the complement cascade components C4, C1qA, C1qB and C1qC was observed, a part of the humoral immune system involved in inflammation and cytolysis., 27768=A common feature of most multicellular organisms is the progressive and irreversible physiological decline that characterizes senescence. Although genetic and environmental factors can influence the aging process, the molecular basis of senescence remains unknown. Postulated mechanisms include cumulative damage to DNA leading to genomic instability, epigenetic alterations that lead to altered gene expression patterns, telomere shortening in replicative cells, oxidative damage to critical macromolecules and nonenzymatic glycation of long-lived proteins (S. M. Jazwinski, Science 273:54, 1996; G. M. Martin, et al., Nature Gen. 13:25, 1996; F. B. Johnson, et al., Cell 96:291, 1996; K. B. Beckman and B. N. Ames, Physiol. Revs. 78:547, 1998). Factors which contribute to the difficulty of elucidating mechanisms and testing interventions include the complexity of organismal senescence and the lack of molecular markers of biological age (biomarkers). Aging is complex in that underlying mechanisms in tissues with limited regenerative capacities (e.g., skeletal and cardiac muscle, brain), which are composed mainly of postmitotic (non-dividing) cells, may differ markedly from those operative in proliferative tissues. Accordingly, approaches which provide a global assessment of senescence in specific tissues would greatly increase understanding of the aging process and the possibility of pharmaceutical, genetic or nutritional intervention., 29266=Genetic manipulation of the aging process in multicellular organisms has been achieved in Drosophila, through the over-expression of catalase and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (W. C. Orr and R. S. Sohal, Science 263:1128, 1994; T. L. Parkes, et al., Nat. Genet. 19:171, 1998), in the nematode C. elegans, through alterations in the insulin receptor signaling pathway (S. Ogg, et al., Nature 389:994, 1997; S. Paradis and G. Ruvkun, Genes Dev. 12:2488-2498, 1998; H. A. Tissenbaum and G. Ruvkun, Genetics 148:703,1998), and through the selection of stress-resistant mutants in either organism (T. E. Johnson, Science 249:908, 1990; S. Murakami and T. E. Johnson, Genetics 143:1207, 1996; Y. J. Lin, et al., Science 282:943, 1998). In mammals, there has been limited success in the identification of genes that control aging rates. Mutations in the Werner Syndrome locus (WRN) accelerate the onset of a subset of aging-related pathology in humans, but the role of the WRN gene product in the modulation of normal aging is unknown (C. E. Yu, et al., Science 272:258, 1996; D. B. Lombard and L. Guanrente, Trends Genet. 12:283, 1996)., 27489=This invention was made with United States government support awarded by the following agencies: NIH Grant No: AG11915. The United States has certain rights in this invention., 45678=For example, Lee, et al., supra, 1999 details the comparison between gastrocnemius muscle from 5 month (young) and 30 month (aged) mice, and 30 month mice under caloric restriction. Lee, et al., supra, 1999 disclose that of the 6500 genes surveyed in the oligonucleotide array, 58 (0.9%) displayed a greater than 2-fold increase in expression levels as a function of age and 55 (0.8%) displayed a greater than 2-fold decrease in expression. The most substantial expression change was for the mitochondrial sarcomeric creatine kinase (Mi-CK) gene (3.8-fold). Sequences that display a greater than three-fold alteration (increase or decrease) with aging, which are prevented or restricted by caloric restriction, such as W08057, AA114576, AA071777, AA106112, D29016, M16465, are likely to be particularly good aging biomarkers., 45261=In one version of this embodiment, one would preferably use high density oligonucleotide arrays representing at least 5-10% of the subject's genes, as described in Lee, et al. at Science 285(5432):1390-1393, 1999 and Lee, et al., Nat. Genet. 25(3):294-297, 2000. (Both Lee, et al., supra, 1999 and Lee, et al., supra, 2000 are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.), 52344=Details on the methods employed to house and feed male C57BL/6 mice, a commonly used model in aging research with an average lifespan of \u02dc30 months, were recently described (T. D. Pugh, et al., Cancer Res. 59:642, 1999). Briefly, mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Mass.) at 1.5 months of age. After receipt in Madison, the mice were housed singly in the specific pathogen-free Shared Aging Rodent Facility at the Madison Veterans Administration Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, and provided a non-purified diet (PLI5001 (Purina Labs, St. Louis, Mo.) and acidified water ad libitum for one week. The mice were then allocated into two groups and fed one of two nearly isocaloric (\u02dc4.1 kcal/g), semi-purified diets. Each mouse in the control group was fed 84 kcal/week of the control diet (TD91349 (Teklad, Madison, Wis.)) which is \u02dc5-20% less than the range of individual ad libitum intakes. This dietary intake was used so that the control mice were not obese and retained motor activity up to the age of sacrifice. Each mouse subjected to CR was fed 62 kcal/week of the restricted diet (TD9351(Teklad, Madison, Wis.)), resulting in a 26% reduction of caloric intake. The latter diet was enriched in protein, vitamins and minerals such that caloric restriction (CR) and control mice were fed nearly identical amounts of these components. The fat component, corn oil, was at the same level (13.5%) in both diets, leading to a 26% reduction in fat intake for the calorie-restricted mice. The adult body weights of the mice averaged \u02dc32 g for controls and \u02dc23 g for those on CR. Mice were euthanized by rapid cervical dislocation, autopsied to exclude animals showing overt disease, and the gastrocnemius muscle was removed from each limb, combined in a micocentrifuge tube, and immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at \u02dc80\ufffd C. All aspects of animal care were approved by the appropriate committees and conformed with institutional guidelines., 43302=For example, choosing markers from Tables 1 and 2 to examine the efficacy of a test compound in aging prevention, one could design a PCR-based amplification strategy or a DNA microarray hybridization strategy to quantify the mRNA abundance for markers W08057, AA114576, 11071777, 11106112, D29016 and M16465 as a function of aging, using animals of several age groups, such as 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months and 30 months. (The marker designations refer to Gene Bank accession number entries.) A second set of animals would be given a test compound intended to slow the aging process at 10 months of age (middle age). Animals from the experimental group would be sacrificed or biopsied at the ages of 12 months, 18 months, 24 months and 30 months. If the test compound is successful, the normal aging-related alterations in expression of these particular markers will be prevented or attenuated., 42148=For example, in order to either measure or determine biological age in skeletal muscle, one would select markers in Tables 1 and 2 that reflect changes in gene expression that have been shown to be either partially or completely inhibited by caloric restriction in skeletal muscle such as AA0071777, L06444, AA114576, etc. Genes that were not affected by caloric restriction (such as W84988, Table 1) may represent chronological markers or aging, and therefore are less useful for the measurement of aging rates. One may determine which genes are or are not affected by caloric restriction by examination of the \u201cCR reversal\u201d lane of Tables 1 or 2., 27027=This application claims priority to provisional application No. 60/148,540, filed Aug. 12, 1999, U.S. provisional application No. 60/178,232, filed Jan. 26, 2000 and U.S. provisional application No. 60/211,923 filed Jun. 16, 2000.
