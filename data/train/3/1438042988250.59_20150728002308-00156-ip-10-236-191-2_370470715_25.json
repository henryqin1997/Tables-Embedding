Note SRP is a MAC-layer protocol developed by Cisco and is used in conjunction with Cisco DPT products. DPT products deliver scalable Internet service, reliable IP-aware optical transport, and simplified network operations. These solutions allow you to scale and distribute your IP services across a reliable optical packet ring infrastructure. This module provides command line interface (CLI) commands for configuring Spatial Reuse",

Release 3.4.0 This command was introduced on the 16-port OC-48c/STM-16c POS/DPT PLIM. Usage Guidelines For the interface-path-id argument, use the following guidelines: If specifying a physical interface, the naming notation is rack/slot/module/port. The slash between values is required as part of the notation. An explanation of each component of the naming notation is as follows: rack: Chassis number of the rack. slot: Physical slot number of the line card. module: Module number. A physical layer interface module (PLIM) is always 0.",
