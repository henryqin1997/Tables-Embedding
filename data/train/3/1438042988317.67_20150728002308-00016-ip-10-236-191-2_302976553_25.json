Under the terms of an act of Congress of 1850, certain white settlers and mixed-blood Indians in the Oregon Territory (which then included Washington) and certain settlers arriving there between December 1, 1850, and December 1, 1853, were entitled to land. The area granted depended upon the marital status of the settler and the date of settlement and varied from 160 to 640 acres. Settlers were required to live on the land and cultivate it for 4 years., 196794=Idaho, 1862-1907. M693. 17 rolls. DP., 102260=John Quincy Adams, 1825-1829. M531. 8 rolls.

During the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress promised bounty land to individuals as an inducement to enter and remain in military service. After the Revolution and following several other conflicts between 1812 and 1855, the federal government issued bounty land warrants to veterans and their heirs as a reward for military service. It also used the promise of free or inexpensive land as a means of encouraging settlement or development of a particular area. Early settlers in a region not yet opened for public sale were often allowed to exercise rights of preemption when the land was later made available. They did so by submitting affidavits and claims showing that they had built a permanent structure or made other required improvements to their preempted tracts as well as proof that they had occupied the tract for a certain period., 226247=Wisconsin, 1849-1907.

T730. 1 roll., 233342=This microfilm publication reproduces four volumes that document dates of appointment of postmasters and, after 1814, dates of establishment of post offices. The first volume is a chronological list of first returns of postmasters and can be used primarily to verify service. Volumes 2 through 4 are generally arranged alphabetically by post office on a national rather than a state basis. The records before 1824 do not show the names of the counties in which the post offices were situated. Some of the pages are not entirely legible., 7387=Internal Revenue Assessment Lists, 1826-1874 (cont.) (Pennsylvania-West Virginia), 44931=Abstracts of Washington Donation Land Claims, 1855-1902.

DP., 16186=Since 1940 the National Archives has been microfilming selected groups of federal records that have high research value. Under this program, negative microfilm is retained by the National Archives and positive prints are made from these master negatives and sold at moderate prices. The chief purposes of the program are to make archival sources more easily accessible to libraries, research centers, and individuals and to ensure against loss of valuable information should the original records be destroyed. In this way, microfilm publications are a partial answer to the researcher's need for more extensive publication of archival materials because they provide a relatively inexpensive method by which he or she can obtain facsimile reproductions of entire series of documents., 95913=John Adams, 1797-1801.

The inclusive dates have been derived from the dates of the first notification and the last donation certificate. Occasionally, some of the correspondence relating to donation lands is dated as late as 1967., 91788=A bounty land warrant application file contains the documents relating to claims for bounty land: an application by the veteran or his widow for a warrant, sometimes a discharge certificate submitted by the veteran or his heirs as evidence of service, and a jacket showing whether the claim was approved or disapproved.

DP., 94626=In the early years of the United States, the State Department was responsible for the conduct of foreign affairs and most aspects of domestic administration not relating to war or finance. Over the years, most of the domestic functions were transferred to other agencies. Because of these varied duties, the Department of State maintained letters of application and recommendation for a variety of federal offices until 1901. Because many of these letters are from or about prominent people, they have a unique biographical value., 107058=Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison, and John Tyler, 1837-1845. M687. 35 rolls.

M1115. 16\u00a0rolls., 26632=The earliest claims to land in the United States came in the form of \"private claims.\" These claims asserted a right to ownership of a particular tract based on a grant, purchase, or settlement that took place before the United States acquired sovereignty over the land. Much of the land in what is now the United States was granted or settled between 1685 and 1853, while it was under the rule of France, Great Britain, Mexico, or Spain. Whenever the United States acquired land from a foreign government, it established a board of commissioners or some other agency to adjudicate private land claims. Because these agencies rarely completed their work, the claims were often referred to other agencies, such as the district office of the General Land Office or the United States district courts., 201733=Mississippi, 1849-1907.

DP., 28672=Military bounty land warrants were certificates issued to eligible veterans giving them the rights to free land in the public domain. Applications for warrants were processed by a succession of administrative units of the War Department until 1849. In 1841 the Secretary of War placed the responsibility for bounty land matters with the Pension Office, which was transferred in 1840 from the War Department to the newly created Department of the Interior. A warrant was redeemable at any local office of the General Land Office, the agency that was responsible for the disposition of public lands., 29763=This microfilm publication reproduces U.S. Revolutionary War bounty land warrants, dated 1789-1833, and related papers dated as late as 1880., 82644=Index by County to Private Land Grant Cases, U.S. District Court, Northern and Southern Districts of California.

DP., 16982=Although the microfilm publication program is one of the oldest continuing programs of the National Archives, it was not firmly established financially until 1948, when a grant of $20,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation provided for accelerated production of microfilm and ensured the continuation of the program through the establishment of a revolving fund. By 1995, more than 265,000 rolls of master negative microfilm had been produced., 79586=The volume reproduced on the single roll of this microfilm publication was prepared in the Office of the Secretary of State of North Carolina in 1791 and submitted the same year to Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State of the United States., 145447=This microfilm publication reproduces the State Department's list of U.S. consular officers, 1789-1939.

(Records for other states are not available on microfilm.) The records are arranged by the Presidential administration in which the applicant filed for a position of federal judge, attorney, or marshal. Thereunder they are filed alphabetically by the name of the applicant. The descriptive pamphlets that accompany these publications include lists of applicants names. General records, which include lists of applicants and other documents not readily identifiable with any one individual, are microfilmed at the beginning of the appointment records for each Presidential administration. Before 1853 the Secretary of State handled the correspondence pertaining to appointments of judicial and legal offices of the federal government., 151677=Records Relating to the Appointment of Federal Judges, Attorneys, and Marshals for the Territories and States of Idaho, 1861-1899.

    "textBeforeTable": "The records listed in this catalog are from the following record groups: Third, NARA keeps only federal records. Births, marriages, and deaths have not been primary concerns of the federal government. These records are best found in family, local, and state records. The second limitation arises from the nature of archives. Records are arranged to reflect their original purpose, usually just as they were kept by the agency that created them. It is not possible to rearrange them in ways that might be more helpful to genealogists. Researchers should also be aware that three important limitations face genealogists doing research at the National Archives. First, the colonial period is not documented; few records predate the Revolutionary War. Also, in the 19th century, the government did not touch the lives of individual Americans to the extent that it does today. The publications described in this catalog are arranged by topic. For each publication, a brief description of the records and the type of information they contain is provided. The contents of each roll of film are listed; however, where the publication titles are self-explanatory and the publication consists of a single roll, the description and roll listing may have been omitted.
