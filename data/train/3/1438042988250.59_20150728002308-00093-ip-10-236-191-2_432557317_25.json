            "COMMUNICATIONS APPARATUS - The present invention provides a communication apparatus canceling a leakage component of the transmission frequency modulated signal superimposed on the input of the receiving circuit. The communication apparatus of the invention includes a transmitting circuit modulating a first baseband signal into a modulated signal by a first scheme, a receiving circuit demodulating a received input signal into a second baseband signal, an antenna duplexer guiding the modulated signal to an antenna and guiding a received signal received by the antenna to the receiving circuit, wherein the received input signal includes the received signal and a leak component of the modulated signal pass through the antenna duplexer, a cancel signal generating circuit generating a canceling signal which cancels the leak component, and a coupler combining the received input signal and the canceling signal, wherein an output signal of the coupler is demodulated at the receiving circuit.",
            "MODULATION DEVICE AND METHOD - A modulation device, which reduces out-of-band leakage of a modulated signal while avoiding reduction in resistance to multipath interference, includes: a modulator configured to generate a modulated signal having a predetermined frequency band in a symbol-by-symbol manner according to an input signal; a signal processor configured to remove components in the predetermined frequency band from a portion of the modulated signal including a symbol period boundary, to generate a desired-component removed modulated signal; and a subtracter configured to subtract the desired-component removed modulated signal from the modulated signal generated by the modulator and output the result."
