If you have eight o' clock classes I would recommend driving or catching 6:30 Wake Tech bus because any time after that buses will be crowded. Explore the campus and get used to walking especially if you have classes in two or more different buildings., 204595=Instructors are really good but the college claims they're having problems hiring instructors for evening courses. I'm enrolled in the pre-nursing program and have just 2 courses to go. One course in particular (Anatomy and Physiology II) has 3 offerings in the evening, but the lab is during the day -- what's the point!? And unfortunately, last semester this course was not offered at all during the evening. Wake Tech also changed the way students are allowed to register. It used to be first come first serve, but now, the more credits you have, the earlier you can register. So those just starting out at the college run the risk of not getting into the courses they need. That's what happened with the Microbiology course I needed. Just one course was offered on a Saturday, but there were students that had priority so the course was full even before it was open to students without that priority status. NC voters in 2012 approved a $200 Million bond for the college to expand and make repairs. Don't know why a college would spend money to expand when their halls are empty during the evening. I wish they would first offer more courses instead of expanding. I'm hoping most of my courses will transfer to another school. I really didn't want to attend a trade school, but it looks like that's what I may need to do.}",
