            "There are a lot of clubs and activities that one can get involved in on campus.",
            "I don't eat there a lot, but the times that I have the food is phenomenal.",
            "I don't live on campus. But I have been to the dorms. They have new buildings for freshman and they looked great.",
            "If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask. I always had a problem with asking people for help, but I had to get over that. Now, if I have a question I simply ask someone, and they answer it or direct me to someone who can answer it.",
            "Staff is really attentive and willing to help out. It is a very friendly and homelike environment. Everything is very accessible here."
