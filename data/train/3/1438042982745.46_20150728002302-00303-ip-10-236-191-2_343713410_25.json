FLEXware 1000 system architecture is capable of supporting up to four FX Series inverter/chargers, four FM80 charge controllers, and all the required AC and DC components and wiring. FLEXware 1000 is easily expandable for systems as large and complex as your imagination allows. FLEXware 1000 AC and DC enclosures accommodate all essential protective devices while still providing lots of room for additional breakers and large cable connections. With mounting provisions for three DC shunts, there is now space for enough to max out the inputs of multi-channel amp-hour meters. For added versatility a FLEXware 1000-based system can be mounted horizontally or vertically. FLEXware 1000 systems come with one RTS, IOB-Q-120/240VAC, HUB10 and X-240.

The special handling fee is $89.00 and is available at checkout. If you have selected this add on service, the shipping carrier will call and schedule delivery of your solar kit, (provided the weight and dimensions of the product fits the criteria for lift gate service). You can avoid the residential and lift gate fees by arranging a \"Will Call\" pickup at the closest freight company terminal.
