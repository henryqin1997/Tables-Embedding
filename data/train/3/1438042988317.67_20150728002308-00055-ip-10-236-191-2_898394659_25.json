    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here When I first went to Bennett College for Women, I thought is that it. Well after finishing my freshmen year, the old saying \u201cyou can\u2019t judge a book by its cover,\u201d holds a lot of truth. The social life at Bennett is truly what you make it. There are many activities from student produced plays to parties sponsored by each class. We also have student organizations geared toward you specific major which are beneficial if you need a study buddy and if we do not have something you like then Bennett gives you the freedom to start something new. At Bennett you will find that freshmen year is when all of your bonds begin to form from activities within your freshmen dorm such as the freshmen step show. Am learning a lot With Bennett being a liberal arts institution, I know the education I am receiving allows me the freedom to explore other majors and interest such as acting or painting and not feel claustrophobic within my own major. Bennett\u2019s curriculum forces you to think outside the box by making classes such as philosophy apart of the general education requirement. It also has specialized programs such as Aces where they invite speakers to bless us with their wisdom and insight into their profession. In all the education is well round",
