            "With Simpson being in such a small town, there really isn't much to do. There are always parties if you want to find them, but its never too crazy. A lot of people leave for the weekends, but I always seem to find something to do.",
            "Not a lot of food options, but they are continuously trying to incorporate more choices into their options. The dining hall is not my favorite, there always seems to be the same thing for every meal. But walmart is a short walk away and the Kent Center has a few other food options that offer a little more variety.",
            "The freshman dorms are very spacious and comfortable. They are relatively quiet, and always safe.",
            "Because of the small class sizes, its not really possible to slack off. Professors give ample opportunities to succeed and will notice if you are falling behind. Simpson is different than big Universities - you can't skip class unnoticed.",
            "If you have any questions, talk to an admissions counselor. They are so helpful and will go out of their way to make sure you get all of your questions answered before moving in, and that your transition to college is a smooth one.",
            "Simpson College is an all-around great private school that allows for personal connections with professor, plenty of opportunities, and is a great learning environment. The benefits of a small college are so great, and my experience at Simpson has been nothing short of great."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Any student that is willing to step up and be great. Simpson offers many opportunities and if you are willing to put yourself out there, you can only be set up for success. Tips for prospective students I would highly recommend stopping by during Private College Week for the tour and if you decided to really make a commitment to Simpson, befriend your destination leader during your personal tour. They will be a great help for EVERYTHING during your school year. Bang for the buck The freshman dorms aren't the greatest, but they are a good environment to live in for your first year. They are very user friendly and are located in central campus so all of your classes are easy to find, as well as the food! Am enjoying being here There is almost always something to do, whether it is on campus or around the town. The location is also great because it is so close to Des Moines. I also enjoy the size of the campus because I don't have to walk all over the town to get from class to class. Am learning a lot",
