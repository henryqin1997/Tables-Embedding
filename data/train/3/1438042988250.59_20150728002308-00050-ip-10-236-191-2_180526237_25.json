O'Brien is remembered not only as a writer of great talent but also as an inspiration to disabled people seeking to lead independent lives. O'Brien's early beginnings as a writer can be traced through his work at California State University, Hayward and U.C. Berkeley. Some of the themes he explored in his school assignments he continued to develop as a professional writer. O'Brien's life and the meaning he held for others is amply demonstrated by the eulogies written by his brother, Kenneth, and film maker Jessica Yu, director of \"Breathing Lessons.\" How I Became a Human Being. O'Brien's articles include some of his journalistic work, including his interview with Stephen Hawking and his ground breaking account drawn from his own experience, \"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate.\" His short stories range from fictionalized autobiography to science fiction. O'Brien's speeches include the eulogy he wrote for his mother, the speech he gave for the English Department commencement at U.C. Berkeley in 1997, and a speech he gave to the employees at the law firm of Littler, Mendelson (where his brother Kenneth is an attorney) after \"Breathing Lessons,\" the",
