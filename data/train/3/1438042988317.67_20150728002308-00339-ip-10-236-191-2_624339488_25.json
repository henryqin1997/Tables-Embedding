            "Data was dowloaded from http://gis5.oit.ohio.gov/geodatadownload/ Standard OSIP imagery and elevation products were collected from 2006 - 2008. To date 36 of the states 88 counties have taken advantage of the OSIP program to obtain enhanced imagery and elevation data through a Cooperative Purchase Agreement (CPA) with the State of Ohio. The CPA benefits the state by providing enhanced resolution products OSIP while saving participating counties an estimated 4.5 million in taxpayer dollars over the cost of obtaining these imagery, LiDAR and elevation products individually. The savings are due in large part to the economy of scale realized through a statewide program and the fact that the state is responsible for the cost of project administration Any information regarding acquisition, dissemination or updates should be directed to the contact information within this metadata or found on the OSIP OGRIP website.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) receieved the data from: http://gis5.oit.ohio.gov/geodatadownload/ Downloaded in las format. The files contained LiDAR elevation and intensity measurements. The data were in Ohio State Plane North (SP83 3401, feet) and NAVD88 vertical datum (in feet, assumed Geoid03). CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The data were converted from Ohio State Plane North (3401, feet) coordinates to geographic coordinates. 2. The data were converted from NAVD88 (orthometric) heights to GRS80 (ellipsoid) heights using Geoid03. 3. The data were sorted by time and zipped to laz format. 4. The data were then cleaned of errant points, determinant of specific county high and low values. As follows: County, Points above elevation removed (meters), Points below elevation removed (meters) Lucas,105,292; Ottawa,120,208; Sandusky,125,none removed ; Erie,103,298; Lorain,103,284; Cuyahoga,131,586; Lake,137,390; Ashtabula,134,398. 5. The individually obtained counties from the Lake Erie coast were combined to form an eight county entity for NOAA's archiving and storage. 6. The data were converted to LAZ format.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
