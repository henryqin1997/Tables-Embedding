            "BROADCASTING METHOD AND RADIO APPARATUS - An RF unit receives periodically signals broadcast by other terminal apparatuses. When the quality of the signal received periodically is more deteriorated than a second threshold value even though the intensity of the signal received periodically is larger than a first threshold value, an identifying unit detects a malfunction in another terminal apparatus from which the signal received periodically by the receiver has been broadcast. A processing unit, a modem unit, the RF unit and an antenna each broadcasts a signal containing the detection result that the malfunction has been detected and information on a detected location.",
            "BROADCASTING METHOD, ACCESS CONTROL APPARATUS AND RADIO APPARATUS - A processing unit generates timing information on timing, with which each of radio apparatuses is to synchronize in communication between the radio apparatuses when each of the radio apparatus broadcasts a signal, to control the communication between the radio apparatuses. A modem unit and the like broadcast the thus generated timing information. An RF unit and the like receive a signal which is synchronous with the timing information broadcast by them. When a signal which is asynchronous with the timing information and when the duration of this signal continues for a period longer than a first threshold value and the quality of this signal is more deteriorated than a second threshold value, a decision unit detects that the received signal is a disturbing signal. The modem unit and the like also broadcast to the effect that the disturbing signal has been detected."

The connector has a mating portion, a plurality of the contacts, a holding member holding the contacts and a shell and to he connected with a mating connector in a front-back direction. The mating portion is positioned in forward part of the connector. The holding member is formed with a protrusive portion protruding back ward. The protrusive portion is formed with a receiving portion. An edge of the shell is formed a stopper portion. The stopper portion and the receiving portion face to each other in the front-back direction. The contact has a contact-fixing portion fixed on the board. The shell has a shell-fixing portion fixed on the board. A distance between the shell-fixing portion and the mating portion is larger than another distance between the contact-fixing portion and the mating portion. 20130273754 Published Description Patent application number Kouji Kawase, Taichung TW 03-06-2014 PAPER CONVEYING APPARATUS - There are provided a paper conveying apparatus that can prevent a drop in quality of the image data while enabling stable conveyance of paper. The paper conveying apparatus includes a first image capture unit, a second image capture unit, a pair of conveyor rollers including a first roller and a second roller, a first conveyor guide, and",

A pump has a predetermined pump volume defined by a length of a piston stroke. The pump having a variable drive. The method includes drawing a first volume of liquid into the pump through a first portion of the piston stroke. The first volume of liquid is less than the pump volume. The first volume of liquid is expelled from the pump through a reverse motion through the first portion of the piston stroke. A second volume of liquid is drawn into the pump through a second portion of the piston stroke. The second volume of liquid is less than the pump volume. The second volume of liquid is expelled from the pump through a reverse motion through the second portion of the piston stroke. At least portions of the first and second portions of the piston stroke are different from one another. 05-14-2009 Masahiro Kawase, Chichibu-Shi JP Patent application number Description Published 20140375305 MEASUREMENT MODULE, ELECTRONIC APPARATUS, POWER SUPPLY TAP, POWER SUPPLY UNIT, AND BUILT-IN MEASUREMENT MODULE - A measurement module includes a pair of input terminals, a pair of current paths connected to the pair of input terminals, and a pair of output terminals.
