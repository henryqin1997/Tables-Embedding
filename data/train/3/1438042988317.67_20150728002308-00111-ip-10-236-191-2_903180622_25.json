            "Gordon's campus safety work round the clock making sure everyone is protected. There have been little to no major incidents on campus. Petty theft is not taken lightly and given much attention when it occurs.",
            "There is no fraternity or sorority life on campus. However, for certain majors there are programs that invite juniors and seniors of high academic standings to be apart of.",
            "There is a huge number of clubs for anyone to take part of. The Student Government of the school is very professional and not to be taken lightly. There are elections for those who are interested in making changes on campus. As for activities there is something big going on almost every month.",
            "Anyone who is looking to foster their faith and learn more about Christianity will get a lot of the Core classes. The Liberal Arts environment is great for more artistically inclined individuals. Gordon is very big on sports, especially Lacrosse. Anyone who loves sporting events will enjoy cheering for the teams.",
            "Gordon Globes is a yearly event where students submit videos to be voted on. There is a red carpet entrance and pre-party to get everyone excited. At the end of the year there is the Golden Goose event where 3 male students are picked and compete in a talent show.",
            "Even though Gordon is expensive it is worth every penny. There are concerts held right on campus and with the low number of students there is a good chance of getting to talk to the band. The academics offer a broad look at many subjects and every student gets the chance to get to know either their advisor or some professor.",
            "Boston is only 30 minutes away and there are multiple train stations to take students into the city so they don't have to drive. There are also a number of local joints that every student should experience. Marty's Doughnut Land is open at midnight and is a fun late night break to take during finals.",
            "While the food may be questionable at times there is a highly qualified staff of chefs who work a number of hours to make meals good. Gordon offers a late night option after dinner which offers more fast food as well as pizza and ice cream.",
            "The Residence Life staff work hard to make dorms feel like home. RAs work to make student's life both spiritually fulfilling and fun. There are always events happening in the dorm as well as will surrounding dorms. There is the Hill Grill and King of the Hill on Upper Campus and a number of BBQs on Lower Campus.",
            "The academics at Gordon are not to be taken lightly. There are high expectations from professors and the work load requires commitment. The TAs of the class normally offer multiple study sessions each week to go over the material covered in class.",
            "Even though some of the rules are extreme and some people may seem a little off, there is no reason to let those aspects defer from applying to Gordon. The people are all wonderful and there is always a group you can fit into. Gordon offers monthly events put on by the Campus Events Council that are quite exciting.",
            "A wonderful institution to foster an understanding of the Christian faith. Some of the rules are somewhat questionable but understandable in perspective of Christian doctrines. The smaller size makes for a great community."

Those who want to really explore ideas and concepts that are not considered in everyday life. Tips for prospective students Visit the Campus!! Gordon was at one point my 4th out of 4 colleges that I wanted to go to. Then I visited and I instantly knew it was where I was supposed to start out my college career. Bang for the buck",
