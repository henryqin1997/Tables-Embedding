    "textBeforeTable": "Latin Perfect Active Tense The perfect tense is used for action that has already been completed. English has two corresponding constructions: present perfect and simple past. The present perfect uses the present of \"to have\" plus the past participle. (\"I have sailed to Athens twice.\" \"These women have spoken the truth.\") The simple past is a separate verb form that indicates a completed action. (\"I came, I saw, I conquered.\") Another related form, which uses \"did\" as an auxiliary, is used for emphasis, negation or interrogation. (\"I did see you at the Forum, didn't I?\") In Latin, the perfect indicative is equivalent to all of these. The perfect endings: 1 \u2022 2 \u2022 3 \u2022 4 \u2022 5 \u2022 6 \u2022 7 \u2022 8 \u2022 9 Chapter 5 1 \u2022 2 \u2022 3 \u2022 4 \u2022 5 \u2022 6 \u2022 7 \u2022 8 \u2022 9 \u2022 10 Chapter 4 1 \u2022 2 \u2022",
    "textAfterTable": "(1) There is an alternative third person plural ending, -\u0113re, used mainly in poetry. For example, am\u0101v\u0113re = am\u0101v\u0113runt. Although these endings apply to all Latin verbs, each verb's stem changes differently in the perfect tense. To find the stem, use the third principal part, which is the first person singular perfect active indicative form of that verb. To conjugate the perfect present, attach the personal ending to the perfect stem. Example am\u014d, am\u0101re, am\u0101v\u012b, am\u0101tum; to love, like Note that am\u0101v\u012b is the first person singular perfect active indicative. Drop the -\u012b to get the stem, which is am\u0101v-, then add personal endings. Singular: am\u0101v- + - \u012b = am\u0101v\u012b (I have loved.) am\u0101v- + - ist\u012b = am\u0101vist\u012b (You have loved.) am\u0101v- + - it = am\u0101vit (He/She/It has loved.) Plural: am\u0101v- + - \u012bmus = am\u0101v\u012bmus (We have loved.) am\u0101v- + - istis = am\u0101vistis (You have loved.) am\u0101v- + - \u0113runt = am\u0101v\u0113runt (They have loved.) Basically, the Perfect indicative active is the perfect tense under a flash name. Rules for Finding the Perfect Stem The perfect stem can often be guessed by knowing the verb's first person singular and infinitive. Here are some rules that perfect stems often follow.
