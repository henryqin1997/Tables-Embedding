            "This school is great for everybody!",
            "Be sure to visit the academic advisor a lot! There are some that are very helpful and will get you going on the right track. Also, make tons of friends and make study groups because they come in handy!! Always be yourself too. You will have a higher self-esteem and find many people who are like you.",
            "The prices here are not all too bad. As the third largest school in Oklahoma, the prices are great! You pretty much get what you paid for. For in-state residents, the cost is pretty cheap, but if you are out-of-state then the cost is a little higher.",
            "I really love the campus. When I took a tour, I felt at home and new I would love it here. The people are so nice and they make you feel welcome. I also love the small classroom size which helps you have one-on-one time with the professor and to gain a better understanding of a particular subject. It's truly amazing!",
            "There are so many interesting classes here at UCO and I learn so much. There is so much to learn from the classes and the new friends that are being made each and every day."

If at any time of day or night you feel uncomfortable, you simply call 405-974-2345 and and someone will drive you on the golf carts to your destination., 455478=Every year, the Asian American Student Association puts on the Asian Moon Festival. It takes place in September, and it celebrates Asian culture, complete with food, activities, and performances. We also participate in Holi every April. It is an Eastern Indian celebration of the spring, and it involves throwing water balloons and paint powder, kind of like the Color Run. The most interesting location on campus is Old North. Built in 1890, it was the school's original building. It is currently being restored, but some swear that the ghosts of previous classes are still there!, 508514=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 252845=Get a planner! It is definitely a huge help to see what is due for each day. Read the chapters! it really does benefit you to read the chapters assigned. Heck, you paid 80 bucks for the book, why not put it to some use? Sleep! I cannot stress enough how important sleep can be. Theres nothing harder than trying to stay awake, much less concentrate in your 5 o'clock class after a day full of classes and nights full of no sleep. Plan your classes out! If your not a morning person and math isn't your strong suit, then you may not want an 8 am trigonometry class.}",

Tips for prospective students Be sure to do as many activities as possible to meet people. Having friends will make your college experience much more enjoyable. Bang for the buck The price of school is not too expensive for residents, but for students who are from out of state it can get pricey. That being said, the school its self is beautiful and worth the price being paid. Am enjoying being here The student life at University of Central Oklahoma is wonderful. Although the school is largly commuter, it is small enough to",
