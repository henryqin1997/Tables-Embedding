Weidner, Woodinville, WA US 05-17-2012 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR DMZ EXTERNAL IP ADDRESSES - A system of a first network, which is intermediate a second network and a third network, connects a host of the second network to a host of the third network. The system includes at least one processor programmed to receive a domain name system (DNS) request for a hostname corresponding to the host of the third network from the host of the second network. An internet protocol (IP) address of the first network allocated and an IP address of the host of the third network is determined from the hostname. The allocated IP address is mapped to the determined IP address and the allocated IP address is returned to the host of the second network in response to the DNS request. 20120124645 Published Description Patent application number Marcus L. Weidner, Willowick, OH US 10-17-2013 INTEGRATED INFUSION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - An integrated infusion management system provides for stable support of components attached to the system, even when the system is mobile. The system is optionally a mobility assist or walker for a patient who is attached to any number of medical components. A central trunk connects to a two-sided base that does not interfere with patient motion. The trunk may be angled with respect to vertical and oriented to support medical components in a configuration that is tip-resistant. The system is",

The Male Connector Screw will be attached to or molded with corresponding tableware, such as bowls and plates, to allow for a secure way to feed children without the problem of tipping of the tableware and/or spills of the food within. 05-03-2012 Michael N. Weidner, Plantation, FL US Patent application number Description Published 20130324095 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DYNAMIC CALL BASED USER ID - A dynamic call based user ID allows subscriber units to be shared amongst a plurality of users or used for a plurality of roles/uses. A voiced call sign is transmitted by a calling subscriber unit to a targeted subscriber unit. A pattern in the voice transmission of the calling unit is detected, and the voiced call sign is compared to a list of pre-stored call signs. When a match between stored calls signs and the current call sign occurs, the calling subscriber unit saves the current call sign. Fixed network equipment (FNE) then associates the saved current call sign with a subscriber unit ID (SUID) of the calling unit. The dynamic association between the call sign and the SUID",
