St. Louis was set up at the Detroit 13, but an offensive holding call made it 1st-and-20. The Rams sputtered from there and were forced to settle for a 41-yard Josh Brown field goal for a 3-0 edge with 3:57 left in the first., 44822=Matthew Stafford connected on 14-of-33 passes for 168 yards and an interception for the Lions (1-6), who have dropped four in a row after winning their only game of the season on September 27 against Washington. Stafford had a rushing TD, while Maurice Morris rushed for 63 yards on 14 carries. Kevin Smith hauled in four passes for 49 yards and rushed for 45 yards on 16 carries in defeat., 46690=\"It means a lot. We've been working hard since March to win a game and unfortunately we lost seven in a row coming into today. It means a lot because we worked hard to finally get a victory,\" said Jackson, who scored his first rushing TD of the season., 43950=Jackson also caught three passes for 17 yards for the Rams (1-7), who won their first game since beating the Cowboys on October 19, 2008. Marc Bulger completed 17-of-35 passes for 176 yards and an interception. Daniel Fells caught a TD pass on fake field goal for St. Louis, which gave Steve Spagnuolo his first win as a head coach in the NFL., 46027=Detroit capitalized with a 10-play scoring drive to tie the game. A 36-yard catch by Bryant Johnson along the right sideline set the Lions up at the five- yard-line. Two plays later, Stafford scrambled into the end zone from four yards out. A successful two-point conversion pass from Stafford to Morris made it 10-10 with 13:51 remaining in the fourth., 46393=Following a series of punts, the Rams took over on their own 38 with 2:26 to play. A defensive pass interference call on third down gave St. Louis a first down at the Lions' 42. Jackson then rushed 17 yards up the middle before breaking the 25-yard game-winning TD run with 1:38 left.}",
