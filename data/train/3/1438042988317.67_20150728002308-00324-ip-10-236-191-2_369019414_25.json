Support in a specific 12.2SX release of this train depends on your feature set, platform, and platform hardware. Usage Guidelines This command sends a Cisco Group Management Protocol (CGMP) leave message with a group address of 0000.0000.0000 and a unicast address of 0000.0000.0000. This message instructs the switches to clear all group entries they have cached. If an interface type and number are specified, the leave message is sent only on that interface. Otherwise, it is sent on all CGMP-enabled interfaces. Examples The following example clears the CGMP cache:  Router# clear ip cgmp Related Commands",
