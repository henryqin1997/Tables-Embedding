There were 6,472 respondents in this group with FFQ data. English and Spanish language versions of the FFQ were used to collect the data and the English version of the FFQ is available on the NHANES 2003-2004 website., 10681=NCI completed extensive research to develop the DHQ food list, test the usability of the questionnaire form, and demonstrate the validity of data produced using the DHQ. The DHQ food list was compiled using food consumption information collected during the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 1994-96 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII). Cognitive testing research was conducted to pretest the DHQ format, wording of questions, and presentation (Subar 1995, Thompson 2002). NCI researchers validated the DHQ and compared results obtained with the DHQ to other food frequency instruments (Subar 2001a, Subar 2001b). The FFQ differs from the DHQ in several respects. The research used to develop the FFQ is described by Subar et al. (2006)., 11354=A few food frequency questions were included in NHANES 1999-2002 to determine the frequency of consumption of milk, fish and shellfish, legumes, and leafy green vegetables. The FFQ questionnaire is a more comprehensive instrument and the data may be used to estimate the usual intake of foods., 12157=A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (previously referred to as the NHANES Food Propensity Questionnaire or \u201cFPQ\u201d), was added to NHANES 2003-2004. The FFQ was used to collect information on the frequency of food consumption during the past 12 months. Two FFQ public data release files were produced. The FFQ Questionnaire File (SAS name: FFQRAW_C) provides information on the actual or \u201craw\u201d questionnaire data. The other FFQ file (SAS name: FFQDC_C), contains daily frequency covariates on food intake. The FFQ data augment the other NHANES 2003-2004 dietary assessment components which include two 24-hour dietary recall interviews and interview information on dietary supplement use, food security, and dietary behavior., 4776=Special FFQ sample weights were produced for the FFQ subsample. Analysts should use the FFQ sample weight (variable name: WTS_FFQ) for all FFQ data analyses. The FFQ sample weights were derived from the NHANES 2003-2004 examined sample weights and were designed to account for FFQ non-response. Respondents with fewer than ten missing frequency values (i.e. FFQ_MISS < 10) have an FFQ sample weight., 12980=Title: Food Frequency Questionnaire \u2013 Raw Questionnaire Responses (FFQRAW_C ) Contact Number: 1-866-441-NCHS Years of Content: 2003 - 2004 First Published: February, 2008 Revised: NA Access Constraints: None Use Constraints: None Geographic Coverage: National Subject:Dietary data on the frequency of food and food group consumption Record Source: NHANES 2003 - 2004 Survey Methodology: NHANES 2003 - 2004 is a stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the U.S. Medium: NHANES Web site; SAS transport files, 9065=The DHQ was originally developed based on CSFII data for adults. NCI analyzed 1994-96 and 1998 CSFII data for children and used the results from the analysis to develop new questions on apple juice, grape juice, granola bar, and pudding/custard consumption frequency for the FFQ. NCI retained most of the standard DHQ items in the FFQ, even if each was not linked to a Dietary Guideline or dietary goal. NCI researchers assessed the fitness of the FFQ for its intended purpose\u2014that is, as supplemental information regarding frequency of food consumption (Subar et al, 2006)\u2014and found it to be suitable for that purpose., 11422=Frequency Questions in NHANES 1999-2002}",
