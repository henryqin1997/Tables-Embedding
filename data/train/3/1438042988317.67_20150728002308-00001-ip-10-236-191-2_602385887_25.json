            "Using a Leica Geosystems ALS50 Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) system, 29 flight lines of an average density of 1.0 meter ground sample distance, data were collected over areas in Baltimore City, MD (approximately 90 square miles). Multiple returns were recorded for each laser pulse along with an intensity value for each return. The data acquisition occurred in 1 mission on April 15, 2008. During the LIDAR campaign, the Sanborn field crew conducted a GPS field survey to establish final coordinates of the ground base stations for final processing of the base-remote GPS solutions. Airborne GPS data was differentially processed and integrated with the post processed IMU data to derive a Smoothed Best Estimate of Trajectory (SBET). The SBET was used to reduce the LiDAR slant range measurements to a raw reflective surface for each flight line. The overlap between flight lines was removed to provide a homogeneous coverage, and the coverage was classified to extract a bare earth digital elevation model (DEM). Airborne GPS is differentially processed using the GrafNAV V7.50 software by Waypoint Consulting of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The PDOP and distance separation is as follows: The classification and quality control (QC) of LiDAR data is carried out using TerraScan software by Terrasolid Limited of Helinski, Finland. IMU data provides information concerning roll, pitch and yaw of collection platform during collection event. IMU information allows the pulse vector to be properly placed in 3D space allowing the distance from the aircraft reference point to be properly positioned on the elevation model surface. The IMU data is processed using the PosPac V4.2 software by Applanix Corporation of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada. The reflective surface is derived using the ALS Post Processor software by Leica Geosystems GIS & Mapping Division of Atlanta, Georgia.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received data in LAS v1.1 format. The files contained LiDAR elevation and intensity measurements. The data were received in state plane coordinates (Maryland; NAD83) and vertically referenced to NAVD88 using the Geoid03 model. The vertical units of data were feet. The data were classified according to ASPRS LAS classification scheme (0 = never classified, 1 = unclassified, 2 = ground 3 = low vegetation, 7 = noise, 12 = overlap). CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The data were converted from state plane coordinates to geographic coordinates (NAD83). 2. The data were converted from orthometric heights to ellipsoidal heights (GRS80) using Geoid 03. 3. The vertical units of the data were changed from feet to meters. 2. The LAS data were sorted by latitude and the headers were updated. 3. The data were converted to LAZ format.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
