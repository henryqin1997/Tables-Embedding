The information provided in this initial data exchange identifies protocols, and their versions, used in the communication. In the case where, after inspection, the capabilities of one of the subjects do not comply with the requirements of the other, the connection is dropped. The following information is sent to the server: Session InitializationEdit Numeric data transmitted over the wire is always in the network byte order. To be able to connect to the specific server, IP address and port number must be provided to the client application. If client receives server\u2019s address from a tracker, the tracker will provide the client with complete address. Otherwise, the user of Hotline client software must manually set this address. IP port number, set in the Hotline client for a specific server, is called base port number. Additional port numbers utilized by the network protocol are determined by using this base port number. Namely, the base port number itself is used for regular transactions, while base port + 1 is used when upload/download is requested. HTTP tunneling uses base port + 2 for the regular transactions, and base + 3 for uploads/downloads. Hotline client is an application executing on the user\u2019s computer, and providing user interface for end-user services (chat, messaging, file services",
