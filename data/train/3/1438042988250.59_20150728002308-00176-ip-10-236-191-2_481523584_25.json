These included a pVIII phagemid mutagenesis library based on the consensus sequence mutagenized at 70:10:10:10 frequency and extended on each terminus with random residues to produce clones which include the sequence XXXX (C, S, P, or R) TLREWL XXXXXX (C or S). A similar extended/mutagenized library was constructed using the peptides-on-plasmids system to produce clones which include the sequence XXXXX (C, S, P, or R)/TLREWL XXXXXXX. An additional extended/mutagenized library, XXXX (C, S, P, or R) TLREWL XXXXXX (C or S), was constructed using the polysome display system. All three libraries were screened with peptide elution and probed with radiolabeled monovalent receptor., 156433=One can also readily modify the peptides of the instant invention by phosphorylation (see, e.g., W. Bannwarth, et al., Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 6(17):2141-2146 (1996)), and other methods for making peptide derivatives of the compounds of the present invention are described in Hruby, et al., Biochem. J., 268(2):249-262 (1990). Thus, the peptide compounds of the invention also serve as a basis to prepare peptide mimetics with similar biological activity., 86509=Specifically, random peptide diversity generating systems include the \u201cpeptides on plasmids\u201d system described in U.S. Pat.

No. 805,727, filed Dec. 6, 1991., 148305=The peptides of the invention can be prepared by classical methods known in the art, for example, by using standard solid phase techniques. The standard methods include exclusive solid phase synthesis, partial solid phase synthesis methods, fragment condensation, classical solution synthesis, and even by recombinant DNA technology. See, e.g., Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85:2149 (1963), incorporated herein by reference. On solid phase, the synthesis is typically commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide using an alpha-amino protected resin. A suitable starting material can be prepared, for instance, by attaching the required alpha-amino acid to a chloromethylated resin, a hydroxymethyl resin, or a benzhydrylamine resin. One such chloromethylated resin is sold under the tradename BIO-BEADS SX-1 by Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif., and the preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is described by Bodonszky, et al., Chem. Ind. (London), 38:1597 (1966). The benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin has been described by Pietta and Marshall, Chem. Commn., 650 (1970) and is commercially available from Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., in the hydrochloride form., 194707=Various peptides of the invention were synthesized using the Merrifield solid phase synthesis techniques (see Steward and Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2d. edition, Pierce Chemical, Rockford, Ill. (1984) and Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85:2149 (1963)) or an Applied Biosystems Inc. Model 431A or 433A peptide synthesizer. The peptides were assembled using standard protocols of the Applied Biosystems Inc. Synth Assists\u2122 1.0.0 or Synth Assist\u2122 2.0.2. Each coupling was performed for 2\ufffd30 min. with HBTU (2-(1H-benzatriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) and HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole)., 71990=\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable ester\u201d refers to those esters which retain, upon hydrolysis of the ester bond, the biological effectiveness and properties of the carboxylic acid or alcohol and are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. For a description of pharmaceutically acceptable esters as prodrugs, see Bundgaard, H., ed., Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam (1985). These esters are typically formed from the corresponding carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Generally, ester formation can be accomplished via conventional synthetic techniques. (See, e.g., March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1992), 393-396 and references cited therein, and Mark, et al., Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1980).) The alcohol component of the ester will generally comprise (i) a C2-C12 aliphatic alcohol that can or can not contain one or more double bonds and can or can not contain branched carbons or (ii) a C7-C12 aromatic or heteroaromatic alcohols. This invention also contemplates the use of those compositions which are both esters as described herein and at the same time are the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof., 146693=FIGS. 3A-G show the results of a series of control experiments showing the activity of TPO, the peptides of the present invention, EPO, and EPO-R binding peptides in a cell proliferation assay using either the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line and its corresponding parental line, or an EPO-dependent cell line and its corresponding parental line. FIG. 3A depicts the results for TPO in the cell proliferation assay using the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line and its corresponding parental line. FIG. 3B depicts the results for-EPO in the cell proliferation assay using the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line and its corresponding parental line. FIG. 3C depicts the results for complexed biotinylated peptide (AF 12285 with streptavidin (SA)) and a complexed form of a biotinylated EPO-R binding peptide (AF 11505 with SA) in the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line. The results for the corresponding parental cell line are shown in FIG. 3D. FIG. 3E depicts the results for TPO in the cell proliferation assay using the EPO-dependent cell line. FIG. 3F depicts the results for EPO in the cell proliferation assay using the EPO-dependent cell line. FIG. 3G depicts the results for complexed biotinylated peptide (AF 12285 with streptavidin (SA)) and the complexed form of a biotinylated EPO-R binding peptide (AF 11505 with SA) in the EPO-dependent cell line. These results show that the peptides of the invention bind and activate the TPO-R with a high degree of specificity., 211810=The libraries are constructed as with peptides on plasmids using headpiece dimer vector pCMG14 (see FIG. 6A-C). The presence of the lac operator is not required for plasmid bindimg by the headpiece dimer protein. The libraries were introduced into bacterial strain comprising E. coli (lon-11 sulA1 hsdR17 (ompT-fepC) \u0394clpA319::kan \u0394lacI lac ZU118 \u0394(srl-recA) 306::Tn10 and amplified under conditions of basal (A) promoter induction. Panning of headpiece dimer libraries is carried out by similar procedures to those used for LacI libraries, except that HEK buffer is used instead of HEKL buffer and elution of plasmids from the wells is performed with aqueous phenol instead of with IPTG. Sequences from headpiece dimer panning are often characterized after transfer to the MBP vector so that they can be tested in the affinity sensitive MBP ELISA and also so that populations of clones can be screened by colony lifts with labeled receptor., 59465=wherein \u201cn\u201d is an interger having a value ranging from about 5 to about 1000, more preferably from about 10 to about 600 and, even more preferably, from about 110 to about 450., 73308=\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable amides\u201d refers to those amides which retain, upon hydrolysis of the amide bond, the biological effectiveness and properties of the carboxylic acid or amine and are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. For a description of pharmaceutically acceptable amides as prodrugs, see Bundgaard, H., ed., Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam (1985). These amides are typically formed from the corresponding carboxylic acid and an amine. Generally, amide formation can be accomplished via conventional synthetic techniques. (See, e.g., March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1992), p. 393 and Mark, et al. Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1980).) This invention also contemplates the use of those compositions which are both amides as described herein and at the same time are the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof., 142500=FIGS. 7 to 9 show the results of a further assay evaluating activity of the peptides and peptide mimetics of the invention. In this assay mice are made thrombocytopenic with carboplatin. FIG. 7 depicts typical results when Balb/C mice are treated with carboplatin (125 mg/kg intraperitoneally) on Day 0. The dashed lines represent untreated animals from three experiments. The solid line represent carboplatin-treated groups in three experiments. The heavy solid lines represent historical data. FIG. 8 depicts the effect of carboplatin titration on platelet counts in mice treated with the indicated amounts of carboplatin (in mg/kg, intraperitoneally (ip) on Day 0). FIG. 9 depicts amelioration of carboplatin-induced thrombocytopenia on Day 10 by peptide AF12513 (513). Carboplatin (CBP; 50-125 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered on Day 0. AF12513 (1 mg/kg, ip) was given on Days 1-9. These results show the peptides of the invention can ameliorate thrombocytopenia in a mouse model., 144778=The specificity of the binding and activity of the peptides of the invention was also examined by studying the cross reactivity of the peptides for the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R). The EPO-R is also a member of the hematopoietin growth factor receptor family, as is TPO-R. The peptides of the invention, as well as TPO, EPO, and a known EPO-binding peptide, were examined in a cell proliferation assay using an EPO-dependent cell line. This assay utilized FDCP-1, a growth factor dependent murine multi-potential primitive hematopoietic progenitor cell line (see, e.g., Dexter, et al., J. Exp. Med., 152:1036-1047 (1981)) as the parental cell line. This cell line can proliferate, but not differentiate when supplemented with WEHI-3-conditioned media (a medium that contains IL-3, ATCC number T1B68). The parental cell line is transfected with human or murine EPO-R to produce the FDCP-1-EPO-R cell line. These transfected cell lines can proliferate, but not differentiate in the presence of human or murine EPO., 141837=The peptides and peptide mimetics of the present invention were also evaluated in a thrombopoietin dependent cell proliferation assay, as described in greater detail in Example 2 below. Cell proliferation is measured by techniques known in the art, such as an MTT assay which correlates with 3H-thymidine incorporation as an indication of cell proliferation (see Mossmann, J. Immunol. Methods, 65:55 (1983)). The peptides tested stimulated proliferation of TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cells in a dose dependent manner as shown in FIG. 1A. These peptides have no effect on the parental cell line as shown in FIG. 1B., 63003=FIG. 3E depicts the results for TPO in the cell proliferation assay using the EPO-dependent cell line. FIG. 3F depicts the results for EPO in the cell proliferation assay using the EPO-dependent cell line. FIG. 3G depicts the results for complexed biotinylated peptide (AF 12885 with streptavidin (SA)) and the complexed form of a biotinylated EPO-R binding peptide (AF 11505 with SA) in the EPO-dependent cell line., 43755=The availability of cloned genes for TPO-R facilitates the search for agonists of this important receptor. The availability of the recombinant receptor protein allows the study of receptor-ligand interaction in a variety of random and semi-random peptide diversity generation systems. These systems include the \u201cpeptides on plasmids\u201d system described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,270,170 and 5,338,665; the \u201cpeptides on phage\u201d system described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/718,577, filed Jun. 20, 1991, U.S. patent application Ser.

In round 2, usually 100 \u03bcl of lysate per well is used. In round 3, 100 \u03bcl of lysate per well diluted with 1/10 in HEKL/BSA is used. For further rounds of panning, typically an input of plasmid transforming units of at least 1000 fold above the estimated remaining diversity is used., 92395=Using the PIG-tailing system, one can cleave the receptor from the surface of the cells expressing the receptor (e.g., transformed CHO cells selected for high level expression of receptor with a cell sorter) with phospholipase C. The cleaved receptor still comprises a carboxy terminal sequence of amino acids, called the \u201cHPAP tail\u201d, from the signal protein for membrane attachment and can be immobilized without further purification. The recombinant receptor protein can be immobilized by coating the wells of microtiter plates with an anti-HPAP tail antibody (Ab 179 or MAb 179), blocking non-specific binding with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, and then binding cleaved recombinant receptor to the antibody. Using this procedure, one should perform the immobilization reaction in varying concentrations of receptor to determine the optimum amount for a given preparation, because different preparations of recombinant protein often contain different amounts of the desired protein. In addition, one should ensure that the immobilizing antibody is completely blocked (with TPO or some other blocking compound) during the affinity enrichment process. Otherwise, unblocked antibody can bind undesired phage during the affinity enrichment procedure. One can use peptides that bind to the immobilizing antibody to block unbound sites that remain after receptor immobilization to avoid this problem or one can simply immobilize the receptor directly to the wells of microtiter plates, without the aid of an immobilizing antibody. See U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/947,339, filed Sep. 18, 1992, incorporated herein by reference., 153281=Using the \u201cencoded synthetic library\u201d or \u201cvery large scale immobilized polymer synthesis\u201d system described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 07/492,462, filed Mar. 7, 1990; 07/624,120, filed Dec. 6, 1990; and 07/805,727, filed Dec. 6, 1991; one can not only determine the minimum size of a peptide with such activity, one can also make all of the peptides that form the group of peptides that differ from the preferred motif (or the minimum size of that motif) in one, two, or more residues. This collection of peptides can then be screened for ability to bind to TPO-R. This immobilized polymer synthesis system or other peptide synthesis methods can also be used to synthesize truncation analogs and deletion analogs and combinations of truncation and deletion analogs of all of the peptide compounds of the invention., 38777=Megakaryocytes are bone marrow-derived cells, which are responsible for producing circulating blood platelets. Although comprising <0.25% of the bone marrow cells in most species, they have >10 times the volume of typical marrow cells. See Kuter, et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:11104-11108 (1994). Megakaryocytes undergo a process known as endomitosis whereby they replicate their nuclei but fail to undergo cell division and thereby give rise to polyploid cells. In response to a decreased platelet count, the endomitotic rate increases, higher ploidy megakaryocytes are formed, and the number of megakaryocytes may increase up to 3-fold. See Harker, J. Clin. Invest., 47:458-465 (1968). In contrast, in response to an elevated platelet count, the endomitotic rate decreases, lower ploidy megakaryocytes are formed, and the number of megakaryocytes may decrease by 50%., 174234=Suitable reagents include, for example, amino acid analogues wherein the carboxyl group of the amino acid has been replaced with a moiety suitable for forming one of the above linkages. For example, if one desires to replace a \u2014C(O)NR\u2014 linkage in the peptide with a \u2014CH2-carbamate linkage (\u2014CH2OC(O)NR\u2014), then the carboxyl (\u2014COOH) group of a suitably protected amino acid is first reduced to the \u2014CH2OH group which is then converted by conventional methods to a \u2014OC(O)Cl functionality or a para-nitrocarbonate \u2014OC(O)O\u2014CGH4-p-NO2 functionality. Reaction of either of such functional groups with the free amine or an alkylated amine on the N-terminus of the partially fabricated peptide found on the solid support leads to the formation of a \u2014CH2OC(O)NR\u2014 linkage. For a more detailed description of the formation of such \u2014CH2-carbamate linkages, see Cho, et al., Science, 261:1303-1305 (1993)., 143521=In addition, certain peptides of the present invention can be dimerized or oligomerized, thereby increasing the affinity and/or activity of the compounds. To investigate the effect that peptide dimerization/oligomerization has on TPO mimetic potency in cell proliferation assays, a C-terminally biotinylated analog of the peptide G G C A D G P T L R E W I S F C G G was synthesized (G G C A D G P T L R E W I S F C G G K (Biotin)). The peptide was preincubated with streptavidin in serum-free HEPES-buffered RPMI at a 4:1 molar ratio. The complex was tested for stimulation of cell proliferation of TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cells, as above, alongside free biotinylated peptide and the unbiotinylated parental peptide. FIG. 2A shows the results of the assay for the complexed biotinylated peptide (AF 12885 with streptavidin (SA)) for both the transfected and parental cell lines. FIG. 2B shows the results of the assay for the free biotinylated peptide (AF 12285) for both the transfected and parental cell lines. FIG. 2C shows the results of the assay for streptavidin alone for both the transfected and parental cell lines. These figures illustrate that the pre-formed complex was approximately 10 times more potent as the free peptide., 202563=Binding affinities of chemically synthesized peptides for TPO-R were measured in a competition binding assay. The wells of a microtiter plate were coated with 1 mg streptavidin, blocked with PBS/1% BSA, followed by 50 ng of biotinylated anti-receptor immobilizing antibody (Ab179). The wells were then treated with a 1:10 dilution of soluble TPO-R harvest. Various concentrations of peptide or peptide mimetic were mixed with a constant amount of a truncated form of TPO consisting of residues 1-156 fused to the C-terminus of maltose binding protein (MBP-TPO156). The peptide MBP-TPO156 mixtures were added to the TPO-R coated wells, incubated for 2 hours at 4\ufffd C. and then washed with PBS. The amount of MBP-TPO156 that was bound at equilibrium was measured by adding a rabbit anti-sera directed against MBP, followed by alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The amount of alkaline phosphatase in each well was then determined using standard methods., 42506=The DNA sequences and encoded peptide sequences for human TPO-R (also known as c-mpl) have been described. See Vigon, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:5640-5644 (1992). TPO-R is a member of the hematopoietin growth factor receptor family, a family characterized by a common structural design of the extracellular domain, including four conserved C residues in the N-terminal portion and a WSXWS motif close to the transmembrane region. See Bazan, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:6934-6938 (1990). Evidence that this receptor plays a functional role in hematopoiesis includes observations that its expression is restricted to spleen, bone marrow, or fetal liver in mice (see Souyri, et al., Cell 63:1137-1147 (1990)) and to megakaryocytes, platelets, and CD34+ cells in humans (see Methia, et al., Blood 82:1395-1401 (1993)). Furthermore, exposure of CD34+ cells to synthetic oligonucleotides antisense to mpl RNA significantly inhibits the appearance of megakaryocyte colonies without affecting erythroid or myeloid colony formation. Some workers postulate that the receptor functions as a homodimer, similar to the situation with the receptors for G-CSF and erythropoietin., 149529=Thus, the compounds of the invention can be prepared by coupling an alpha-amino protected amino acid to the chloromethylated resin with the aid of, for example, cesium bicarbonate catalyst, according to the method described by Gisin, Helv. Chim. Acta., 56:1467 (1973). After the initial coupling, the alpha-amino protecting group is removed by a choice of reagents including trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) solutions in organic solvents at room temperature., 61531=FIGS. 2A-C show the results of peptide oligomerization using the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell proliferation assay. FIG. 2A shows the results of the assay for the complexed biotinylated peptide (AF 12285 with streptavidin (SA)) for both the transfected and parental cell lines. FIG. 2B shows the results of the assay for the free biotinylated peptide (AF 12285) for both the transfected and parental cell lines. FIG. 2C shows the results of the assay for streptavidin alone for both the transfected and parental cell lines., 91844=TPO-R, as well as its extracellular domain, were produced in recombinant host cells. One useful form of TPO-R is constructed by expressing the protein as a soluble protein in baculovirus transformed host cells using standard methods; another useful form is constructed with a signal peptide for protein secretion and for glycophospholipid membrane anchor attachment. This form of anchor attachment is called \u201cPIG-tailing\u201d. See Caras, et al., Science, 243:1196-1198 (1989) and Lin, et al., Science, 249:677-679 (1990)., 99360=Peptide mutagenesis studies were also conducted using the polysome display system, as described in co-pending application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/300,262, filed Sep. 2, 1994, which is a continuation-in-part application based on U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/144,775, filed Oct. 29, 1993 and PCT WO 95/11992, each of which is incorporated herein by references for all purposes. A mutagenesis library was constructed based on the sequence X X X X (C,P,R,or S) t l r e f l X X X X X X (C or S), in which X represents a random NNK codon, and the lower case letters represent amino acid codons containing 70:10:10:10 mutagenesis at positions 1 and 2 and K (G or T) at position 3 of the codon. The library was panned for 5 rounds against TPO receptor which had been immobilized on magnetic beads. After the fifth round, the PCR amplified pool was cloned into pAFF6 and the ELISA positive clones were sequenced. The sequences were subcloned into an MBP vector and their binding affinities were determined by an MBP ELISA., 64986=FIG. 6A depicts a restriction map and position of the genes for the construction of headpiece dimer libraries in vector pCMG14. The library plasmid includes: the rrnB transcriptional terminator, the bla gene to permit selection on ampicillin, the M13 phage intragenic region (M13 IG) to permit rescue of single-stranded DNA, a plasmid replication origin (ori), one lacOs, sequence, and the araC gene to permit positive and negative regulation of the araB promoter driving expression of the headpiece dimer fusion gene. FIG. 6B depicts the sequence of the cloning region at the 3\u2032 end of the headpiece dimer gene, including the SfiI and EagI sites used during library construction. FIG. 6C shows the ligation of annealed ON-1679, ON-829, and ON-830 to SfiI sites of pCMG14 to produce a library. Singles spaces in the sequence indicate sites of ligation., 62073=FIGS. 3A-G show the results of a series of control experiments showing the activity of TPO, the peptides of the present invention, EPO, and EPO-R binding peptides in a cell proliferation assay using either the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line and its corresponding parental line, or an EPO-dependent cell line. FIG. 3A depicts the results for TPO in the cell proliferation assay using the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line and its corresponding parental line. FIG. 3B depicts the results for EPO in the cell proliferation assay using the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line and its corresponding parental line. FIG. 3C depicts the results for complexed biotinylated peptide (AF 12285 with streptavidin (SA)) and a complexed form of a biotinylated EPO-R binding peptide (AF 11505 with SA) in the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line. The results for the corresponding parental cell line are shown in FIG. 3D., 204311=The pJS142 vector is used for library construction and is shown in FIG. 4. Three oligonucleotide sequences are needed for library construction: ON-829 (5\u2032ACC ACC TCC GG); ON-830 (5\u2032TTA CTT AGT TA) and a library specific oligonucleotide of interest (5\u2032GA GGT GGT {NNK}n TAA CTA AGT AAA GC), where {NNK}n denotes a random region of the desired length and sequence. The oligonucleotides can be 5\u2032 phosphorylated chemically during synthesis or after purification with polynucleotide kinase. They are then annealed at a 1:1:1 molar ratio and ligated to the vector., 41631=The gene encoding TPO has been cloned and characterized. See Kuter, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:11104-11108 (1994); Barley, et al., Cell 77:1117-1124 (1994); Kaushansky et al., Nature 369:568-571 (1994); Wendling, et al., Nature, 369:571-574 (1994); and Sauvage et al., Nature 369:533-538 (1994). Thrombopoietin is a glycoprotein with at least two forms, with apparent molecular masses of 25 kDa and 31 kDa, with a common N-terminal amino acid sequence. See, Bartley, et al., Cell, 77:1117-1124 (1994). Thrombopoietin appears to have two distinct regions separated by a potential Arg-Arg cleavage site. The amino-terminal region is highly conserved in man and mouse, and has some homology with erythropoietin and interferon-a and interferon-b. The carboxy-terminal region shows wide species divergence., 66331=The heavy solid lines represent historical data. FIG. 8 depicts the effect of carboplatin titration on platelet counts in mice treated with the indicated amounts of carboplatin (in mg/kg, intraperitoneally (ip) on Day 0). FIG. 9 depicts amelioration of carboplatin-induced thrombocytopenia on Day 10 by peptide AF12513 (513). Carboplatin (CBP; 50-125 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered on Day 0. AF12513 (1 mg/kg, ip) was given on Days 1-9., 76555=In addition to peptides consisting only of naturally-occurring amino acids, peptidomimetics or peptide analogs are also provided. Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed \u201cpeptide mimetics\u201d or \u201cpeptidomimetics\u201d (Luthman, et al., A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, 14:386-406, 2nd Ed., Harwood Academic Publishers (1996); Joachim Grante, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 33:1699-1720 (1994); Fauchere, J., Adv. Drug Res., 15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger TINS, p. 392 (1985); and Evans, et al., J. Med. Chem. 30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference). Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent or enhanced therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biological or pharmacological activity), such as naturally-occurring receptor-binding polypeptide, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: \u2014CH2NH\u2014, \u2014CH2S\u2014, \u2014CH2\u2014CH2\u2014, \u2014CH=CH\u2014(cis and trans), \u2014COCH2\u2014, \u2014CH(OH)CH2\u2014, and \u2014CH2SO\u2014, by methods known in the art and further described in the following references: Spatola, A. F. in Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins, B. Weinstein, eds., Marcel Dekker, New York, p. 267 (1983); Spatola, A.

A particularly preferred non-peptide linkage is \u2014CH2NH\u2014. Such peptide mimetics may have significant advantages over polypeptide embodiments, including, for example: more economical production, greater chemical stability, enhanced pharmacological properties (half-life, absorption, potency, efficacy, etc.), altered specificity (e.g., a broad-spectrum of biological activities), reduced antigenicity, and others. Labeling of peptidomimetics usually involves covalent attachment of one or more labels, directly or through a spacer (e.g., an amide group), to non-interfering positions) on the peptidomimetic that are predicted by quantitative structure-activity data and/or molecular modeling. Such non-interfering positions generally are positions that do not form direct contacts with the macromolecules(s) (e.g., immunoglobulin superfamily molecules) to which the peptidomimetic binds to produce the therapeutic effect. Derivitization (e.g., labeling) of peptidomimetics should not substantially interfere with the desired biological or pharmacological activity of the peptidomimetic. Generally, peptidomimetics of receptor-binding peptides bind to the receptor with high affinity and possess detectable biological activity (i.e., are agonistic or antagonistic to one or more receptor-mediated phenotypic changes).}",
