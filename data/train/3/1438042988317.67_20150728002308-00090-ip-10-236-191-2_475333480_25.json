Ltd.) in a mixture of water-ethanol (1:1, 1000 g) for granulation, and subsequently, the mixture was dried in a fluidized bed. The mixture was subjected to sizing with a twin rotor equipped with a 32 mesh screen, and thereto were added L-menthol (10 g) and magnesium stearate (15 g). The resulting mixture was blended in a V-blender to give granules for tabletting. The mixture was compressed on a rotary tabletting machine (Cleanpress C19, manufactured by KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD.) to give tablets having a diameter of 9.5 mm and a hardness of 0.5 kg. Further, the resulting tablets thus obtained were subjected to aging at room temperature for 3 days to give intrabuccally disintegrating tablets weighing 300 mg each., 91345=According to the prescription of Table 9, erythritol (60 g, solubility: about 47.5 g, manufactured by NIKKEN CHEMICALS CO., LTD.) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (K30, 60 g, manufactured by BASF Aktiengesellschaft) were dissolved in a mixture of water-ethanol (1:1, 2000 g), and the mixture was treated in the same manner as in Example 3 to give tablets having a hardness of 0.3 kg. Further, the resulting tablets were subjected to aging at 80\ufffd C. for 2 minutes to give intrabuccally disintegrating tablets weighing 300 mg each., 82844=According to the prescription of Table 7, erythritol (60 g, solubility: about 47.5 g, manufactured by NIKKEN CHEMICALS CO., LTD.), polyvinylpyrrolidone (K30, 150 g, manufactured by BASF Aktiengesellschaft) were dissolved in a mixture of water-ethanol (1:1, 2000 g), and the mixture was treated in the same manner as in Example 3 to give tablets having a hardness of 0.3 kg. Further, the resulting tablets were subjected to aging at 70\ufffd C. for 4 hours to give intrabuccally disintegrating tablets weighing 300 mg each., 95601=According to the prescription of Table 10, erythritol (30 g, solubility: about 47.5 g, manufactured by NIKKEN CHEMICALS CO., LTD.) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (K30, 60 g, manufactured by BASF Aktiengesellschaft) were dissolved in a mixture of water-ethanol (1:1, 1500 g), and the mixture was treated in the same manner as in Example 3 to give tablets having a hardness of 0.5 kg. Further, the resulting tablets were subjected to aging at 70\ufffd C. for 4 hours to give intrabuccally disintegrating tablets weighing 300 mg each., 37855=For example, the tablets obtained by a method disclosed in the above U.S. Pat. No. 4,371,516 (corresponding Japanese Patent Publication JP-B-62-50445) have weak strength, and they may have problems when pushed out from PTP. Moreover, said method has complicated production procedures, and requires additional equipment, and hence, it is not advantageous in view of the cost. On the other hand, although the tablets obtained by the method disclosed in WO 93-12769 have improved strength, said method has also complicated production procedures as the method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,371,516 (corresponding Japanese Patent Publication JP-B-62-50445) does, and hence, it is not advantageous in view of the cost., 87091=According to the prescription of Table 8, sucrose (60 g, solubility: about 170 g, manufactured by Dai-Nippon Meiji Sugar Co., Ltd.) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (K30, 60 g, manufactured by BASF Aktiengesellschaft) were dissolved in a mixture of water-ethanol (1:1, 1500 g), and the mixture was treated in the same manner as in Example 3 to give tablets having a hardness of 0.3 kg. Further, the resulting tablets were subjected to aging at 70\ufffd C. for 4 hours to give intrabuccally disintegrating tablets weighing 300 mg each., 65352=According to the prescription of Table 3, xylitol (45 g, solubility: about 135 g, manufactured by Eisai Co., Ltd.), hydroxypropylcellulose (L, 30 g, manufactured by NISSO, Ltd.) were dissolved in a mixture of water and ethanol (1:1, 1500 g), and the mixture was treated in the same manner as in Example 3 to give tablets having a hardness of 0.2 kg. The resulting tablets were subjected to aging at room temperature for 3 days, to give intrabuccally disintegrating tablets weighing 300 mg each., 35686=JP-A-8-291051 and JP-A-9-48726 disclose a method for producing an intrabuccally disintegrating tablet, which comprising compression-molding a powder containing mainly a saccharide and a water-soluble binder under a low pressure, wetting the resulting tablets by placing them under humid, and drying them (hereinafter, occasionally referred to as \u201chumidification method\u201d).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As explained in the above, the method of the present invention can be carried out without using any specific facility, and by which the desired intrabuccally disintegrating tablets can easily be produced in a large scale. Besides, the tablets produced by the method of the present invention are excellent intrabuccally disintegrating tablets which show good disintegrating property in the oral cavity as well as show enough strength being sufficient so that they do not disintegrate during the handling. Purified water at 25\ufffd C. (20 ml) was put into a beaker, and thereto was added each saccharide under stirring. Xylitol, sorbitol, glucose and sucrose were added in portions of 1 g, and erythritol was added in portions of 0.5 g, and lactose and mannitol were added in portions of 0.1 g, each. The mixture was stirred for one hour, and the dissolved amount of each saccharide was determined. The amount dissolving in 100 ml of water was converted and used as solubility of the saccharide in the present specification. Measurement of Solubility of Saccharides As is shown in the above Tables 18 and 19, the tablets obtained in Examples 1-14 showed satisfactory values in the disintegrating time and the hardness thereof, but the tablets obtained in Reference Example 7 showed problems in both the disintegrating time and the hardness thereof, and the tablets obtained in other Reference Examples showed problems in either one of the disintegrating time",
