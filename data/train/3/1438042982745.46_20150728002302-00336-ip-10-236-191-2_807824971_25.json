The following table describes the components of the .Net framework 3.5 and the job they perform: Components of .Net Framework 3.5 The ASP.NET runtime transforms the .aspx page into an instance of a class, which inherits from the base class page of the .Net framework. Therefore, each ASP.NET page is an object and all its components i.e., the server-side controls are also objects. ASP.NET is a technology, which works on the .Net framework that contains all web-related functionalities. The .Net framework is made of an object-oriented hierarchy. An ASP.NET web application is made of pages. When a user requests an ASP.NET page, the IIS delegates the processing of the page to the ASP.NET runtime system. Server controls, which help in developing complex user-interface. For example, the Calendar control or the Gridview control. Server side counterparts of almost all HTML elements or tags, such as <form> and <input>. The ASP.NET component model provides various building blocks of ASP.NET pages. Basically it is an object model, which describes: The ASP.NET Component Model This way, the server becomes aware of the overall application state and operates in a two-tiered connected way. The ASP.NET runtime carries the page state to and from the server across page requests while generating ASP.NET runtime codes, and incorporates the state of the server side components in hidden fields.
