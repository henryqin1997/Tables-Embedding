            "CHARACTER-BASED AUTOMATED MEDIA SUMMARIZATION - Methods, devices, systems and tools are presented that allow the summarization of text, audio, and audiovisual presentations, such as movies, into less lengthy forms. High-content media files are shortened in a manner that preserves important details, by splitting the files into segments, rating the segments, and reassembling preferred segments into a final abridged piece. Summarization of media can be customized by user selection of criteria, and opens new possibilities for delivering entertainment, news, and information in the form of dense, information-rich content that can be viewed by means of broadcast or cable distribution, \u201con-demand\u201d distribution, internet and cell phone digital video streaming, or can be downloaded onto an iPod\u2122 and other portable video playback devices.",
