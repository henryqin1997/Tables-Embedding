Tables are ordered by the performer's last names. Virtually every guest appearance on Due South is listed in the index below, including some who received no on-screen credits. Almost all are linked to the Internet Movie Database (some are linked to extensive bios at this web site instead), and the episodes are linked to the episode guides at this site. If you know of a performer who has been overlooked, please contact us. This index includes appearances from all four seasons of the show. Compiled by: Elyse Dickenson Ultimate Due South Cast Index",
