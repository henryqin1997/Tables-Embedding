Further, the step of subjecting particles to a preliminary magnetic field is conducted for at least about 1 second, more preferably at least about 30 seconds, and most preferably at least about 60 seconds. The positive effect of a preliminary magnetic field can be further enhanced by increased temperatures. More particularly, the process is conducted at temperatures of at least about 100\ufffd C., more preferably 150\ufffd C., and most preferably 200\ufffd C., 18148=This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/038,759, filed Feb. 21, 1997, entitled \u201cBENEFICIATION OF SALINE MINERALS.\u201d, 225196=Run 2 was conducted to evaluate the capacity of the matrix and how the purity of the non-magnetic fraction was affected as the matrix was loaded up with a magnetic fraction. The magnetic separator was fed 100 g of feedstream at a time until 1000 g had been run through the matrix without removing any magnetic fraction from the matrix. After the last 100 g had been run through the matrix, the magnetic fraction was removed from the matrix by ramping down the magnetic coil in tesla increments. The first sample was produced by reducing the field from 5 tesla to 3 tesla. The next three samples were recovered by reducing the magnetic field from 3 to 2 tesla, from 2 to 1 tesla, and from 1 to 0 tesla. A final magnetic sample was recovered by shaking the unit at 0 tesla.}",

Furthermore, the description is not intended to limit the invention to the form disclosed herein. Consequently, variations and modifications commensurate with the above teachings, and the skill or knowledge of the relevant art, are within the scope of the present invention. The embodiment described hereinabove is further intended to explain the best mode known for practicing the invention and to enable others skilled in the art to utilize the invention in such, or other, embodiments and with various modifications required by the particular applications or uses of the present invention. It is intended that the appended claims be construed to include alternative embodiments to the extent permitted by the prior art. These test results show that the reduction of impurities was obtained by use of wet high intensity magnetic separation. This eliminates or reduces the need to remove insoluble impurities by conventional means such as filtration from a saturated sodium carbonate solution. It also allows the removal of these impurities found in trona without the need to remove sodium carbonate monohydrate first to prevent loss of crystals in a filter cake or rejection stream. compared to other samples.
