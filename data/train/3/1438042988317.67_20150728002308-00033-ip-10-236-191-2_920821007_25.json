    "textAfterTable": "I think tuition is ridiculous at any school. I've never opened a book for ANY of my classes (so if you want - go ahead and save a few bucks there). That being said.... teachers/classes are decent. YES there are a few shitty teachers - you will probably have one each semester. BUT a majority are pretty decent - as long as you remember they are human too, they are there to teach you, and you RESPECT them. Am enjoying being here Awesome place for commuter students who work. I happen to work downtown, so it's got a pretty central location. The campus is decent enough - pretty kick back, especially if you enjoy an occasional conversation with a crazy homeless person or have a close encounter with the ridiculous amount of squirrels. :) - if you go here, you'll know EXACTLY what I mean. Our library is pretty banging. Huge, (also a public library) TONS of quite space to study/entire building made of windows so it's not a boring place to study either. Great school if your from the area... however... i still recommend going away to school if your local - IF it's manageable. I know I regret it.... you only have these years once, do them right! Am learning a lot - Lower division General",
