            "KSU, like many other college campuses, is equipped with its own police force, that works in conjunction with surrounding Cobb County police. Emergency boxes are everywhere as well, just in case, and the KSU police do provide escort service, especially for all the ladies out there at night time who would rather have peace-of-mind when traveling back to their dorms. Overall, the campus is quite safe and the police response to any issues is within minutes.",
            "I do not have much experience with the Greek life on campus, but I do know that one drawback is that no common houses for each Fraternity or Sorority are allowed at KSU. If you expected to live in a Greek house, sadly this is not the place for you. Otherwise the groups meet at the KSU student center and still plan a host of events!",
            "There are too many clubs and activities to list. Some include: sports clubs, hobby clubs, religious clubs, and more!",
            "If you don't like the idea of a massive campus, but do like the idea of still having plenty of students walking around, this is the place for you. KSU is up-and-coming and soon to finalize its football agenda.",
            "What can I say, you have to be here to experience much of the traditions. Greek life always has something planned.",
            "The tuition prices are great for the quality of professors here, as well as overall experience. The only issue is if you live on campus, housing can become expensive, compared to off-campus accommodations. The meal-plan is also decently priced in respect to the unlimited food you have access to once inside the dining hall, which is named The Commons. Again, the unlimited plan is overkill and buying a smaller sub 200 meal plan is a more down-to-earth money saver.",
            "The green is a nice place to relax and throw some frisbee, or even take a nice walk. Concerts and other events seem to be thrown for students every few weeks, so there is always something to look forward to! KSU also has its own wellness center equipped with a ton of exercise equipment and resources!",
            "The food here is very delicious, and the only reason it did not garner 5 out of 5 stars is because it can get repetitive. Burgers and pizza every other day as alternatives to eating the gourmet flare meals, which can sometimes taste rather different, can become tiring. The food is touted to be very healthy, most of which is organic and sourced in the vicinity of Kennesaw.",
            "A variety of dorms surround the campus exterior, and provide a nice place to live. The dorms are styled like apartments, and really make you feel at home. Residence life is also helpful.",
            "Classes here are definitely tough. Smaller sized colleges are sometimes wrongly attributed to easy A's, but this is not one of them. Trust me, the science program is more than a challenge.",
            "Living on, or at least near campus is easier than the commute, especially being in close proximity to Atlanta traffic. Do not buy the unlimited meal plan, no matter what your stomach tells you, it is not worth the extra cost in the end. Enjoy yourself when you get here!",
            "Kennesaw is an up-and-coming college, growing each day in student body and size. Campus life is calmed, yet abundant. The campus is its own small world, where the site of familiar faces each day is refreshing, as opposed to being lost in a crowd."

I have had friends who love it and some who don't. It's all what you make of it., 129917=We've only been around since 1963, so we don't have any unusual traditions...YET., 329393=There are parties if you meet the right people, otherwise it may be hard as this is a commuter school and people are independent so live on campus. There is Kennesaw mountain, a mall, and many restaurants and bars. Kennesaw is getting a football program in 2014 and there is always intramurel sports, 742066=Our student dining hall is ranked one of the highest in the nation and has even beat out those at culinary schools. We have several other dining choices on campus that accept the meal plan as well. The food is delicious and there is a good variety, by fall of 2014 we should have a new taco bar as well., 14051=KSU is rapidly growing and constantly changing - it's an exciting time to be an Owl! The dining hall, The Commons, was added in fall 2009 and a new soccer stadium (where the Atlanta Beat soccer team plays) opened in May 2010. A football team is expected in 2014. The dorms are great because you get your own bedroom regardless of which of the four communities you live in., 226638=Kennesaw has a very diverse population and is accommodating to all types of students, not just traditional high school graduates. It offers clases online for the non-traditional student who may not have time for going to campus or night classes, as well as classes starting from 7:30 am ending at 10:15pm for the students who want to come to class before or after work. There are a number of hybrid classes, and classes offered at the center for continuing education for specific certifications that don't require even being a Kennesaw student. There is a variety of major options and graduate school options so that anyone seeking almost any degree is welcomed and will be taken care of there., 566345=It varies; I remember my ENGL 1101 class was way easier than the equivalent high school course, AP Language and Composition. In contrast, I struggled through CHEM 1211, but in high school I breezed through Chemistry., 833037=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 76275=I will learn about KSU when I attend the walking tour they have in July. They also have a session set up for adult learners in August before school starts., 609477=I've never lived on campus. I live close by, in off-campus housing. More and more off-campus housing is opening each year and the shuttle buses stop at them. From my friends places, the housing is better than other schools. You don't share bedrooms. May have to share a bathroom depending on the floor plan you choose., 319451=I commuted, so I don't have an opinion on this one. But my friends that lived on campus loved it. I have been inside them before (hanging out with friends), and they are very nice, especially the new ones. They are building even more now, since our attendance continues to explode, so I'm sure those will be state-of-the-art, environment-friendly like the other ones too! They will be available around Fall 2012, Summer 2013 I think., 318496=AWESOME dining hall. We got The Commons in 2010, and it has never disappointed. Even students with food allergies can find something tasty to eat there! And if not, the cooks are way cool that they will MAKE something for you! Sweet, huh? They are also environmentally aware. They collaborate with farmers and local growers for their food, and use water sparingly. Even the toilets have a system to cut down on water use! There are many stations- an Asian, ethnic, all-American, pizza/pasta, soul, greens/fruits, sandwich, all kinds! And then there are themes to the food stations- from Greek, to African, to Thai, and everything in between! Yum... seriously, good stuff., 139861=we have tons of sports and intramural activities to chose from. we have everything from tennis to camping. the only sport we don't seem to have is football, but we are planning to have a team in 2014., 104986=There are many things around campus to do, such as hookah bars, if youre into that kind of thing. In 2015 there will be a football team so tailgating will be an option. Many people hang out in each others dorms since they are so big., 571296=In 2009 I lived in the freshman housing and it was pretty decent. They kept everything clean in the building and their were monthly fire drills. KSU housing department tends to have events for students living there,for example: movie nights, parties, and casino night, so I would defiantly recommend freshman trying to find their way on their own and in college live on campus. If you do not wish to live on campus, there are many college style housing located around the campus that the B.O.B (Big Owl Bus) provides transportation to and from school., 775750=This school has everything, or at least it will by Fall 2015. The dorms are the ridiculously high quality- even the worst dorms are better than some of the best dorms on other campuses. With the renovations and additions to so many buildings, there's no way but up from here., 773205=Those emergency buttons and call stations are everywhere, the KSU police is everywhere. They take every report seriously. I have never even once begun to feel unsafe on campus. Also, ask anyone from the class of 2017 about the fire alarms in the University Village Suites. Let's just say there's no way there will ever be a fire that all of the Suites doesn't know about.., 21474=Tuition cost is, by far, the best thing about Kennesaw State University. The low In-state tuition has allowed me to take my core classes at a very acceptable and reasonable price. The campus is beautiful and the new dining hall is very deserving of appraisal. The services on campus are excellent for the cost of attending, and the price is perfect for the quality of education received. I'm sure we will see tuition costs rise dramatically very soon, as the introduction of a football team in 2014 will be spark some increased interest in this tuition state-wide, and possibly even nation-wide., 607735=There isn't going to be a football team until Fall 2015 but there's still Homecoming. They have a Intramural Flag Football game instead.}",
