Gonzalez made four catches during the march, including a 2-yard TD catch., 76572=New Orleans' first offensive series did not go according to plan. On the first play, Asante Samuel made a diving interception. Atlanta started at the 27 of the Saints following Samuel's unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Matt Bryant made a 37-yard field goal to make it 10-0 with 9:19 remaining., 77021=The Saints started at their own 10-yard line following a punt from the Falcons. New Orleans used a mix of run and pass plays to move the ball to the Atlanta 29-yard line. From there, Brees hooked up with Graham to extend his NFL record of consecutive games with a touchdown pass to 52. The score gave the home team a 14-10 lead with 13:33 left until half.}",
