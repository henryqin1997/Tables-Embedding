So all Removal of before and after interceptors The best approach to take when upgrading a plugin or application (and if your application is using several plugins the plugins will need upgrading first) is to create a new Grails 3.0 application of the same name and copy the source files into the correct locations in the new application.

For plugins the plugin descriptor (a Groovy file ending with \"GrailsPlugin\") which was previously located in the root of the plugin directory should be moved to the src/main/groovy directory under an appropriate package. New Files Not Present in Grails 2.x The reason it is best to create a new application and copy your original sources to it is because there are a number of new files that are not present in Grails 2.x by default. These include: File Description build.gradle The Gradle build descriptor located in the root of the project gradle.properties Properties file defining the Grails and Gradle versions grails-app/conf/logback.groovy Logging previously defined in Config.groovy is now defined using Logback grails-app/conf/application.yml Configuration can now also be defined using YAML grails-app/init/PACKAGE_PATH/Application.groovy The Application class used By Spring Boot to start the application Files Not Present in Grails 3.x Some files that were previously created by Grails 2.x are no longer created.",
