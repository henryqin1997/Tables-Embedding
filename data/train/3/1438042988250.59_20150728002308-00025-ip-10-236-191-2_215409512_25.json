Wilson is also the only QB to post a passer rating of at least 100.0 in each of his first two years., 12340=However, Carroll and his team are confident, and certainly not concerned that they're the first team since the 1990 Bills to not have a player with Super Bowl experience on the roster. The Seahawks lost 21-10 to Pittsburgh in their only previous Super Bowl appearance following the 2005 season., 9995=Regardless of the outcome Sunday, Manning, who turns 38 in March, doesn't appear ready to call it a career. He also remains humble when talking about his place in NFL history., 16918=Denver is 34-19 against Seattle and won 31-14 in the most recent meeting in 2010. That includes the Seahawks' 31-7 home victory in the only postseason matchup between the former AFC West rivals in 1983., 8898=After undergoing a series of neck operations that forced him to miss the 2011 season for the Colts, Manning earned the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award last season when he threw for 4,659 yards with 37 touchdowns while leading the Broncos to a 13-3 record. They lost to eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore 38-35 in overtime in the divisional round, a stunning defeat in a game Denver appeared to have locked up before a 70-yard Ravens touchdown pass tied the game with less than a minute left., 10765=His teammates will certainly be glad to see him stay. Demaryius Thomas recorded at least 90 receptions and 1,400 yards for a second straight year and caught a career-high 14 touchdowns in 2013. Eric Decker set career bests with 87 receptions and 1,288 yards while catching 11 TDs., 11202=Tight end Julius Thomas had one reception in his first two NFL seasons but blossomed into one of the game's best with 65 for 788 yards and 12 TDs in 2013., 8121=For the first time since the New York Giants beat Buffalo 20-19 in Super Bowl XXV following the 1990 season, the NFL's top-ranked offense from Denver (15-3) will face the top-rated defense in Seattle (15-3)., 10188=\"I've been being asked about my legacy since I was about 25 years old. I'm not sure you can have a legacy when you're 25 years old. Even 37,\" said Manning, who won Super Bowl XLI with the Colts and will try to lead Denver to its third after it won during the 1997 and '98 seasons., 9417=Poised to help his team take the next step, Manning opened the 2013 season by throwing an NFL record-tying seven touchdowns in a 49-27 rout of Baltimore. That set the tone for the rest of the season, as he went on to set league records with 5,477 passing yards and 55 TDs for a team that averaged NFL bests of 37.9 points, 340.3 passing yards and 457.3 total yards.}",
