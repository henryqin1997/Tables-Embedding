For example, Short-Form 36 (SF-36) is gaining acceptance as a generic health outcome assessment form. The SF-36 validates health outcomes with 8 indices of health and well-being including general health (GH), physical function (PF), role function due to physical limitations (RP), role function due to emotional limitations (RE), social function (SF), mental health (MH), bodily pain (BP), vitality and energy (VE). Each health object is scored on a 0 to 100 basis with higher scores representing better function or less pain. Other scoring or ranking schemas for identifying and quantifying physiologic and pathophysiologic (phenotypic) states (traits) include, not are not limited, the following: ATP III Metabolic Syndrome Criteria; Criteria for One Year Mortality Prognosis in Alcoholic Liver Disease; APACHE II Scoring System and Mortality Estimates (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health disease Classification System II); APACHE II Scoring System by Diagnosis; Apgar Score; Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia Diagnostic Criteria; Arterial Blood Gas Interpretation; Autoimmune Hepatitis Diagnostic Criteria; Cardiac Risk Index in Noncardiac Surgery (L.

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{396556=[0205] One aspect of the present invention is to provide a database of endogenous metabolites suitable for use with human conditions. Preliminary estimates of the total number of compounds in a human are varied. The standard wall-chart of metabolism, which includes reactions not present in humans, lists only about 800 compounds in core primary metabolism. Most biochemical textbooks extend this list to no more than 1200 to 1500 compounds, again drawing from all life forms. Extensive querying of publicly available databases for human metabolites enables extension of the list to approximately 2000 compounds. Even assuming the final number of compounds in the human metabolome to be between 3000 and 4000, the size of the metabolome is workable and forms a firm foundation for scientific discovery., 609513=[0341] The site-of-action of isoxaflutole is 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD, E.C. 1.13.11.27), which converts 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate. Homogentisate is a precursor to \u03b1-tocopherols and plastoquinones. It is believed that carotenoid biosynthesis is indirectly inhibited by depletion of plastoquinones, a cofactor of phytoene desaturase, resulting in the bleaching phenotype observed with isoxaflutole. Tyrosine is an upstream precursor to homogentisate biosynthesis and, in some organisms including humans, phenylalanine can be converted to tyrosine via phenylalanine hydrolase., 259321=[0068] In the methods of the invention, data is collected for a plurality of peaks, each peak comprising at least one chemical component. In the methods of the invention the plurality of peaks comprises at least 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 85, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200, 1250, 1300, 1350, or 1400 or more peaks., 649316=[0383] Image Analysis Software (Version A.4.0.45, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) was used for image analysis. Each feature was determined from an array's associated pattern file and a detection algorithm. Intensity values for each feature were determined after subtracting background derived from an average of negative control features. Features with unusual pixel intensity statistics (e.g., high non-uniformity, saturation in either channel, and the like) were excluded from downstream analyses. Data was loaded into the Rosetta RESOLVER database (Rosetta Inpharmatics Inc., Kirkland, Wash.) for storage and analysis. Data was evaluated after combining results from fluor reversal replicate hybridizations. The annotation of yeast ORFs was obtained from Proteome BIOKNOWLEDGE Library (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, Calif.)., 299238=[0103] In order to support the creation and analysis of coherent data sets, proper technical infrastructure must be available. Appropriate computer hardware is supplied, for example, by the Sun Microsystems' E420 workgroup server (Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.). Appropriate operating systems include, but are not limited to, Solaris (Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.), Windows (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.), or Linux (Red Hat, Inc., Raleigh, N.C.). Appropriate software applications include, but are not limited to, relational databases such as Oracle 9.0.1 (9i) (Oracle Corp., Redwood Shores, Calif.), DB2 Universal Database V8.1 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y.), or SQL Server 2000 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.), and software for statistical analyses, such as packages available from SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.) or SPSS, Inc. (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill.). In one embodiment, the server is the E420 workgroup server (Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.), the operating system is Solaris (Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.), and the software is Oracle 9.0.1 (9i) (Oracle Corp., Redwood Shores, Calif.), and statistical software is from SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.)., 646341=[0379] Approx. 18\ufffd1 mg of lyophilized yeast cells in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube were rehydrated in 75 \u03bcL RNA LATER (Ambion, Inc., Austin, Tex.) and incubated for 30 minutes. 875 \u03bcl TRIZOL Reagent (GibcoBRL, Rockville, Md.) were added to each tube. The tubes were vortexed for 15 seconds and allowed to rest for 45 seconds, repeated, and continued for a total of 5 minutes. 240 \u03bcl 100% Chloroform (RNAase-free) was added to each tube. Tubes were vortexed for 30 seconds, then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT). The tubes were then spun at 14,000 rpm in a refrigerated eppendorf centrifuge at 4\ufffd C. for 5 minutes. 570 \u03bcl of the aqueous phase was removed and placed in a new, RNAase-free 2.0 ml tube. 430 \u03bcl nuclease-free water (Ambion, Inc., Austin, Tex.), and 1.0 ml 100% isopropanol, were added to each tube and mixed thoroughly by inversion. Tubes were incubated for 10 minutes at RT. Samples were centrifuged for 20 minutes as before. Pellets were washed with 400 \u03bcl 70% ethanol and centrifuged for 10 minutes as before. The pellet was then dissolved in 100 \u03bcl nuclease-free water. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer 2100 and the RNA 6000 assay (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorption at 260 nm in an Ultrospec 2000 (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.). Microarrays containing approximately 6200 S. cerevisiae genes, essentially covering the entire genome, were generated by Agilent Technologies using oligonucleotides 60 bases in length synthesized in situ by an ink-jet printing method (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.)., 982652=[0413] Data are analyzed using software such as Image Analysis Software (Version A.4.0.45, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) and then loaded into a database appropriate for storage and further analysis, such as the Rosetta RESOLVER database (Rosetta Inpharmatics Inc., Kirkland, Wash.)., 945006=[0389] In AF1, two different technologies were utilized: gene expression analysis (for examination of mRNA expression) and metabolite analysis. More than 6300 genes were measured by gene expression and more than 600 chemical components were measured by LC-MS and GC-MS. As noted previously, existing metabolic databases may be helpful in practicing the methods and systems of the present invention, but many databases include limitations that make their use in data analysis and pathway mapping less than straightforward. In the case of AF1, use of the KEGG database to map gene information to pathways resulted in the mapping of 1145 significantly changed genes to a total of 103 pathways. A caveat limiting the reliance on the mapping data is that KEGG mapping is not unique (one gene does not map to a single pathway), and 45% of the genes mapped to more than one pathway, as shown in FIG. 19. This caveat to KEGG makes it difficult to pinpoint the correct pathway when attempting to link a gene to a specific pathway., 648164=[0381] RNA samples were labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 using Agilent's Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.). Labeled cRNAs were evaluated using the RNA 6000 assay on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Labeled cRNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorption at 260 nm in an Ultrospec 2000 (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.). Probe solutions containing 125 ng of labeled cRNA for each mutant and its paired control were prepared using Agilent's in situ Hybridization Reagent Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.). Each pair of samples to be hybridized were independently labeled and hybridized utilizing a fluor reversal for a total of two hybridizations per sample pair. The microarrays were scanned simultaneously in the Cy3 and Cy5 channels with Agilent's 48-slide, Dual Laser DNA Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) at 10 \u03bcm resolution using default settings., 230937=[0036]FIG. 19 illustrates the mapping of genes to pathways based on data obtained from experiment AF1, which examined the effects of the antifungal drugs Amphoteracin B, Ketoconazole, Fluconazole, and Posaconazole on yeast cells. Yeast gene accession numbers were parsed from KEGG pathway files resulting in the mapping of 1145 genes to 103 pathways. The percentage of genes (y-axis) is plotted versus the number of pathways (x-axis)., 555771=[0287] Gas chromatography was performed on a ThermoFinnigan Trace2000 GC (Thermo Finnigan Corp., San Jose, Calif.) equipped with an autosampler and a split/splitless injection port. The gas chromatograph was coupled to a ThermoFinnigan Tempus time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan Corp., San Jose, Calif.) fitted with an electron impact (EI) ion source. Chromatographic separations were conducted using a 50% phenyl/50% methyl polysiloxane stationary phase, helium carrier gas, and a programmed oven temperature that ramped from a starting temperature of 50\ufffd C. to a final temperature of over 300\ufffd C. Analyses were conducted with 1 \u03bcL injection volumes in split mode with a split ratio of 50:1. Electron impact mass spectra were acquired at 70 eV, at rate of 10 spectra/second, over the range m/z 41 to 640. Paraffins used as retention standards for calculating retention indices were prepared by diluting a Florida TRPH standard (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, Pa.) to a working concentration of 25 \u03bcg/mL each in methyl tert-butyl ether with 0.005% v/v tetramethylene sulfone as an internal standard., 404584=[0214] Minimal sample preparation was performed on plant tissues for metabolite analysis. Arabiclopsis tissue (leaves, siliques, seeds) was harvested directly into tared and barcoded tubes (96-well format) in liquid nitrogen using an automated weighing station (Mettler-Toledo Bohdan, Inc., Vernon Hills, Ill.). Samples were lyophilized without being allowed to thaw, mechanically ground to powder, and stored at low humidity (\u226610%) until undergoing analysis. In the case of silique samples, polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) was added at a ratio of 1:3 (sample:PTFE) to facilitate the grinding and dispensing steps. Similarly, polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) was added at a ratio of 1:5 (sample:PTFE) to facilitate the grinding and dispensing steps for seed samples., 553502=[0282] Lyophilized tissue was disrupted by grinding for 5 minutes at 1800 rpm using a grinder and stored in a controlled environment until further analysis. Approximately 10 mg of dried ground tissue was extracted in 0.5 ml 10% aqueous methanol containing isotopically labeled internal standards. The extract was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 2 minutes, diluted with an equal volume of 50% aqueous acetonitrile (V/V), and transferred to a temperature-controlled autosampler (4\ufffd C.) of a HP1100, HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.)., 202686=[0002] The present application is related to U.S. application Ser.
