At each evaluation point, the differences in clinical grades (evaluation score subtracting the baseline score) within each product is evaluated using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, Pratt-Lehmann version (Lehmann, E. L. Nonparametrics: Statistical Methods Based on Ranks. San Francisco, Calif.: Holden Day, 1975, pg.130). Statistical significance will be determined at the 90% confidence level (p<0.10). This will indicate if the treatment results are statistically significant from their baseline score., 163230=The critical limits on the FA/(PAG+Protic Acid Salt) ratios for these moisture contents are show in FIG. 4. The critical FA/PAG range varies somewhat with water content but is about 0.5 to about 2.0, i.e., in a ratio of 1:2 to 2:1., 77157=If dryness and erythema rank scores are also assigned at each evaluation, the treatments will be compared with respect to the rank scores by application of the Friedman's test on the ranks, with subject acting as a block [ref. Hollander, Myles and Douglas A. Wolfe. Nonparametric Statistical Methods. New York, N.Y. John Wiley & Sons, 1973, pp. 139-146]., 90563=This protocol adopts as a working assumption the view promulgated by Ertel et al (Ertel, K. D., G. H. Keswick, and P. B. Bryant. Forearm controlled application technique for estimating the relative mildness of personal cleansing products., J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem., 46, 67 (1995)) that the dryness and erythema scales are linear. Hence, parametric statistical methods will be used. The effects of each test product will be examined by comparing the clinical grade at each time point versus the baseline clinical grade using a paired t-test. Statistical significance will be determined at the 90% confidence level (p-value 0.10) to determine if treatment results are statistically different from their baseline score and in which direction. (G. W. Snedecor and W. G. Cochran, Statistical Methods. Ames, Iowa. The Iowa State University Press, 1980, pp. 84-86)., 30441=There has been a great deal of research and development devoted to making soap bars milder. A recent review is provided by Murahata et al. (Cleansing Bars for Face and Body: In Search of Mildness, in Surfactants in Cosmetics, Ed M. Rieger and L. Rhein, 1997 Marcel Dekker, New York). The approaches include incorporation of relatively high levels of cationic polymers, mild synthetic surfactants, and the inclusion of a relatively high level of glycerol (>10%). All of these approaches have their limitations in terms of cost, manufacturing feasibility and impact on sensory properties and cost. One commercially successful approach is a so called \u201ccombo bar\u201d of soap and a synthetic surfactant (e.g., acyl isethionate) as used for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,954,282 to Resch et al. (relating to Lever 2000\ufffd type product). Even here, the sensory properties, use-up rates and cost do not match those of soap. Thus, there is a very real need for a method of cleansing the skin that is perceived to provide the refreshing cleansing experience and economy of soap while maintaining better skin care especially in the reduction of barrier damage and the increase in the level of moisture retention relative to common soap., 33089=wherein ratio of polyalkylene glycol to C6 to C22 fatty acid is 1:3 to 3:1 and polyalkylene glycol has MW below 100,000 Dalton. There is no teaching of the specifically defined protic acid salts of the invention; of the ratios of these salts to free fatty acid; or of the sensory (soap-like clean) and skin care benefits (as measured by defined tests) provided when meeting the defined criteria of the invention.}",
