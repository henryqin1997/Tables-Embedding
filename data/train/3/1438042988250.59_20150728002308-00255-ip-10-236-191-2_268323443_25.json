Denominator: U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population ages 2-19 who were overweight Note: Overweight children are identified using age- and sex-specific reference data from the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention body mass index (BMI) for age growth charts. Children with BMI values at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific BMI growth charts are categorized as overweight., 79031=Key: MSA = metropolitan statistical area. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health Interview Survey, 2009. Denominator: Patients with current asthma.

Denominator: Adult nonmaternity patients completing an episode of skilled home health care. Note: Starting January 1, 2010, the patient assessment instrument for home health agencies was changed to OASIS-C. Because dyspnea improvement is measured similarly in both the previous and current versions of the assessment instrument, we are presenting 2002 through 2010 trend data., 60779=Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health Interview Survey, 2000-2010.

Denominator: Civilian noninstitutionalized population with asthma. Note: Age adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population. People with current asthma report that they still have asthma or had an asthma attack in the last 12 months. Insurance groups presented are for patients under age 65., 129435=Source: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Minimum Data Set, 2000-2010. Data for long-stay residents are from the third quarter of each calendar year. Data for short-stay residents are full calendar-year estimates. Denominator: Short-stay and high-risk long-stay nursing home residents in Medicare- or Medicaid-certified nursing and long-term care facilities. Note: For this measure, lower rates are better. On October 1, 2010, CMS required nursing homes to begin using the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0. The figure uses the earlier MDS 2.0 instrument, which includes data from the first 9 months of 2010., 120730=Source: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument, 2004-2011.

Denominator: Adult nonmaternity patients completing an episode of skilled home health care and not already performing at the highest level at the start of the episode, according to the OASIS question on ambulation. Note: Starting January 1, 2010, the patient assessment instrument for home health agencies was changed to OASIS-C and ambulation improvement is measured differently than with the previous version of the assessment instrument. Therefore, we are presenting only 2010 data., 83223=Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 2002-2008. Denominator: Civilian noninstitutionalized adult current smokers who had a checkup in the last 12 months., 65885=Source: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicare Quality Improvement Organization Program, 2007-2010. Denominator: Patients hospitalized with a principal discharge diagnosis of pneumonia or a principal discharge diagnosis of either septicemia or respiratory failure and secondary diagnosis of pneumonia. Note: Recommended care includes initial antibiotics within 6 hours of hospital arrival, antibiotics consistent with current recommendations, blood culture before antibiotics are administered, influenza vaccination status assessment or provision, and pneumococcal vaccination status assessment or provision., 90909=Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 2002-2009. Denominator: Civilian noninstitutionalized adults age 18 and over with obesity. Note: For this measure, lower rates are better. Obesity is defined as a body mass index of 30 or higher. Basic activity limitations refer to problems with mobility, self-care, domestic life, and activities that depend on sensory functioning, and complex activity limitations refer to limitations experienced in work and in community, social, and civic life.
