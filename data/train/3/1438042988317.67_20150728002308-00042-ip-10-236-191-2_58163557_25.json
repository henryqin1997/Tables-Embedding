ART was supported by the State of Alaska, the Alaska State Council on the Arts, the Municipality of Anchorage, the Fairbanks North Star Borough, the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as many public and private foundations, corporations, and individuals. In the first season, three productions were presented in Anchorage and Fairbanks. In later seasons, ART productions went on tour to various Alaskan communities. The organization was operated by a board of directors, a producing artistic director, a technical director, and a business manager. On November 3, 1988, the board of directors voted to close the ART \"with dignity\" because of a lack of sufficient financial support and an increase in the organization's operating deficit. The last day of operation was December 31, 1988., 22155=1985 October 26, 40966=1987, 225106=\u00c2\u00a01985-1986, 151303=Series 7: Development and foundation records.
