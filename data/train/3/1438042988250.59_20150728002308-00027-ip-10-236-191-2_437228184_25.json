Research has shown greatly increased nutrient levels since 1932, the sources of these nutrients and their effect on corals. The research also showed that levels of erosion and nutrient loss from sugar cropping can be (greatly) reduced by changes in farming practice - changes that have been voluntarily adopted by most sugar farmers on irrigated land on the coast of Queensland., 160196=80 Useful reading on CBA includes Sugden and Williams, 1978; and Sassone and Schaffer, 1978. 81 See Box A.24., 45187=Satellite data for coastal map for planners, Calauag and Lopez Bays, the Philippines.

Chapter 17 of Agenda 21, `Protection of oceans, all kinds of seas including enclosed and semi-enclosed seas, coastal areas and the protection, rational use and development of their living resources' outlines a commitment by coastal nations to `integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas and the marine environment under their national jurisdiction'.

For example, the 1988 Spanish Shores Act provides that within 100 m landwards from the landwards limit of the seashore `Generally, only works, installations and activities which by their very nature may not be located elsewhere or which provide services necessary or convenient for the use of the coastal public property will be permitted'., 176798=84 See Mitchell and Carson, 1989. 85 See Shogren et al., 1994. 86 See Freeman, 1979; Tietenberg, 1994; and Pearce and Turner, 1990., 179098=Source: Olsen, 1996., 63277=This project ended in 1992 with the main output in the Philippines being the Lingayen Gulf Coastal Management Plan.

    "textBeforeTable": "Some of the specific issues that should be considered in reviewing laws that affect the management of coastal areas are set out in Box A.4. The obligations, principles, standards and recommendations contained in international agreements and documents provide a useful measure against which to evaluate national legal frameworks for ICAM. In some instances, it will be important for drafters of national laws to take into account the provisions of binding international treaties, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea26\u00a0 and others.27\u00a0 In addition, useful guidance in preparing ICAM policies and legislation can be obtained from the provisions of a variety of non-binding international documents such as the Earth Summit agreements and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (which includes Article 10 on `Integration of fisheries into coastal area management') and others.28\u00a0 Fishers' group leaders and fisheries officers setting priorities, Kamsar, Guinea Landing site development committee meeting, after having obtained legal right to protect the site from encroachment of real estate development, Conakry, Guinea Fishers planning coastal microprojects, Hio, Benin Women training, Hio, Benin establish mechanisms for averting or resolving disputes concerning the use of coastal resources (e.g. laws or procedures that provide for the use of techniques such as conciliation, mediation and arbitration.25\u00a0 provide a structure within which human and other resources",
    "textAfterTable": "Are there clearly identified bodies mandated to implement the plans and do they have the necessary legal powers to do so? Are there processes for consultation and coordination between relevant agencies and for resolving interagency conflicts? Does the legal system as a whole provide suitable legal mechanisms to implement the plan? Do other laws conflict with or hinder the attainment of ICAM objectives? For example, inadequate controls on deforestation or harmful agricultural practices in the catchment area may result in increased sedimentation in rivers with negative consequences for coastal areas. Are there adequate mechanisms to encourage and enforce compliance? For example do the relevant authorities have the necessary powers and capacity, including powers of enforcement in exclusive economic zones in accordance with international law, are the sanctions sufficient to deter illegal or undesirable activities and, where appropriate, are there incentives for self-regulation by local stakeholders? Is the legislation that is proposed to facilitate ICAM consistent with the legal system as a whole, consistent with international commitments, clear, equitable and enforceable, bearing in mind financial, institutional and other constraints? 2.3 THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK During the policy process for ICAM, goals and objectives are determined and the means to achieve them are formulated in strategies and plans. The process will vary considerably from one country to another, depending upon the size of the country, the issues to be considered, the institutional framework, cultural background and many other considerations.",
