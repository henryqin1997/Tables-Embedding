Reviewer has been to campus. 2 out of 2 people found this review useful. 3 of 29 Categories Comments Will enjoy being here I slept over, attended a class, had a great time and I'm already considering myself as part of the community... It really is amazing!!!! Will learn a lot The advantage of being a rural school, is that the students will be more concentrated or focus on school than anything else that could keep them back from achieving their goals...
