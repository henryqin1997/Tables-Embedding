A natural strokemaker, useful medium-pacer and excellent fielder, for a number of years when England were trying almost everyone it seemed to be just a matter of time before Jesty's turn came - but it never did. He finished second to Andy Roberts in Hampshire's bowling averages in 1975, and in 1976 passed 1000 runs for the first time. In 1982 he really hit form, scoring 1645 runs at 58.75, including eight hundreds, and chipping in with 31 wickets, and in 1982 was named one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. To general surprise he was overlooked for the Ashes tour but ended up in Australia as injury cover, playing in ten ODIs. He was included in the England squad for the 1983 World Cup but did not play and that was that. He was vice-captain of the county under Nick Pocock and was expected to succeed him, but he was passed over in favour of Mark Nicholas midway through the 1984 season and at the end of the year moved to Surrey. He continued to score heavily, staying at The Oval for three summers before finishing his career at Lancashire. He also spent time playing domestic cricket in South Africa and New Zealand. He subsequently became an umpire, and is a regular on the county circuit.. Martin Williamson, 51371=Apr 15, 2009, 52401=Sep 27, 2006}",
