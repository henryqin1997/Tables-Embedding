    "textBeforeTable": "Atlanta Hawks (11-28) It's becoming more common to see broadcasts and newspapers refer to the stats of a team's starters and bench players in a given game. While this is a difficult measure in that players go in and out of the starting lineup over the course of a season, and the roles vary considerably from team to team, we'll take a look at the team data so far. Please note that the starter/reserve designation is particular to the given game, and not a reflection of who should be starting or would be starting if not for injuries. Also note that the numbers reflect the sum for each individual and so will not add up to the team total (as you have five players on court at the same moment, but only one \"team\" on court). We will publish commentary on these stats at a later date. - Data as of Jan. 14, 2004. - Pts/100 = Estimated points per 100 possessions.
