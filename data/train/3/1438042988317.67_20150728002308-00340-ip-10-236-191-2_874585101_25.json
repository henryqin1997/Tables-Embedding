He can slow the passage of time for brief intervals. He is also very concerned about wasting time, telling people that they are early or late for their battle. Time Man is purple in color, with an alarm-clock like head. Time Slow (\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30b9\u30ed\u30fc) DLN-00B Oil Man (\u30aa\u30a4\u30eb\u30de\u30f3) Oil Man is a new type of high performance robot designed for maintenance. Oil for robots can be made inside his body and output through his arm cannon. He uses this oil to attack and can ride an oil slick much like a snowboard. In the Japanese version and the demo given in Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X, Oilman looks like a blackface character. He has been changed in other versions to be dark blue with yellow lips instead of the possibly offensive black with pink lips. In the Mega Man comic series by Archie Comics, his design is modified further, and his red scarf now covers his lips entirely.
