I know, it's all the way on the other side of the map, but since you are in your brand new crib, just grab a chopper to head over there (the hover bike is a fun one to use). This is our final medium level activity. You will have to make $500,000 worth of damage in 3:30. Should be no problem, just keep firing and focus in on the high value targets as much as you can., 308616=(C) Copyright Ron Hiler 2011. All rights reserved., 195451=We only need 1000 feet worth of distance to get this challenge completed (windshield cannon is when you hit another car and go flying out the front). The tricky bit is getting it to go off. I found that in the normal course of driving, it won't happen very often, and pretty much never when you are purposely trying to do it., 90893=big plane and shoot it down (going into hover mode when you are within 1000 feet or so makes this pretty easy)., 129142=If you didn't already have a McManus 2015, this mission will automatically give you one in your weapon cache. Nice!, 44181=We are right near this activity in The Grove, so let's start it up. In this iteration, we need to make $4,000 in 3:30. No problem, right? Be careful of the hunter (a minigun brute). Otherwise, it's the same deal as always. Hit the signs (but not the Panda sign) for extra health, time, and money. Kill the mascots and make your way through the traps to the exit. Done and done.}",

Missions Here is the obligatory checklist for completing the game with the 100% completion statistic. Have fun! 100% Completion Checklist Take the chopper up to your gang. Before you can get there, more military arrive. Keep taking them out with the rockets. Helicopters, tanks, snipers, the whole lot. Just keep plugging away at them, and ultimately, you will finally finish this one off. Time to go for the bridge to pull Pierce's butt out of the fire. Uh oh, looks like our powers are wearing out. They will last long enough for us to get to the bridge and take out the military forces. Once that is done, you return to normal. Too bad! Drive for Planet Saints now. Still no Gat/Tag, but we have some Morningstar to play with. You can take out Brutes with your super punch, or the fireball works as well. Either way. Alright, call up Jimmy, and then drive back over to his house. Wow cool, check us out, we have powers. Alright, wait for Jimmy to give you a location, and then super run over there. No Tag here, but lots of military, take them all out (use your fireball to take down the chopper).",
