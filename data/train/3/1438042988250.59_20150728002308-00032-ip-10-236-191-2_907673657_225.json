            "Tallahassee is dangerous. We have FSU police out all the time. We have a system of alarms all over campus that you can hit if you feel not safe and police will be there within a minute. They also have a self-defense class that you can take for free. It is very helpful and fun!",
            "Greek life is such a good way to get involved on campus and find people that you have a lot of things in common with. My favorite part is the philanthropies. I love being able to help so many people through them!",
            "We have such a variety of clubs and if you can't find one you like you it is pretty easy to create your own. You should join because it helps you get used to college and make friends! Go to sporting events! They are free and are so much fun!",
            "On your 21st birthday you are supposed to get thrown in Wescott Fountain!",
            "There isn't much in Tallahassee. Make friends to hang out and go out with. Otherwise go the the Rez that is sponsored by the university or go tanning on Landis Green.",
            "The dining halls have the worst food and some of the cooks are quite unsanitary and have attitudes. We have a small choice of other places to eat on campus. The best place we have is our Starbucks. Also, go to Mom and Pops hot dog stands on campus - they have the best lemonade ever!",
            "I lived in a suite-style dorm and would strongly recommend you live in a community style. They are just much more social and you meet so many more people that way. Although the suite-style are a lot nicer living.",
            "Going to class is the best advice. Most classes as long as you go, pay attention, and take notes you don't even need to buy the book unless the professor says otherwise.",
            "Join an organization. It is the best way to get used to college and create a family away from home. Also, go to class (it actually helps a lot)!",
            "It is absolutely breathtaking! The university strives to make sure the students are receiving the best education and experience. The students are the friendliest I have seen than on any other campus and we have a great sense of pride for our wonderful school, Go Noles!"

Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. You\u2019ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. There\u2019s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you don\u2019t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSU\u2019s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the world\u2019s largest magnetic of it\u2019s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",

Tips for prospective students TIME MANAGEMENT!!! It's so important to make sure you dedicate enough time to your studies especially in your first year. Also, probably the most important tip I can offer an incoming freshmen would be to get involved. The best way to shrink the campus and not feel lost is to get involved in a school sponsored club, activity, sport, student government or even a religious organization. Bang for the buck With the current budget cuts in Florida, it is difficult to do many things including getting an education. Luckily, FSU works with the budget crisis committee and so far has",
