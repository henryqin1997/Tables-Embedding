I thank all of you for your support and kindness to me. I had no idea. Again my thanks, steve June 12, 2002 Please follow this link. We are moving, hopefully for the last time. My thanks to Traci Parsons who has worked so hard to move these pages and give them a new look and complete make over. She is a wonderful friend and I am extremely grateful for her hours of hard work. Moving is a long and difficult process. Hopefully the Sixteenth site will follow shortly to the new address.
