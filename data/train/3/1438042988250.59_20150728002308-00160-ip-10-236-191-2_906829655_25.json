I've been going here at the Bryan campus for the Fall 2012 semester and I did in fact enjoy it greatly. I am looking forward to returning for the 2013 Spring semester.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot It's definately a big change from high school. Some teachers are set in their ways and have their own methods, so you just have to go with the flow. Classes aren't that bad, even if you slacked in high school. Just apply yourself and you should do fine.

Also, students who want to attend Texas A&M University usually attend Blinn for one or two years. Blinn has the highest transfer rate to A&M. In fact, many of the professors at Blinn also teach courses at the A&M campus. It is a cheaper path to get some of the prerequisite courses out of the way before one is to pay the high tuition of Texas A&M",
