This process 274 is called if the caller is not a registered patient and has not previously called and registered as an assistant with the system 100. States 1050 through 1090 are similar to states 420 through 454 of the patient registration process 252 (FIG. 9). Because of this similarity, only significant differences are discussed in the interest of avoiding repetitiveness. States 1052, 1056, 1060, 1062 and 1064 pertain to the assistant rather than the patient as in states 422, 426, 427, 429 and 431 (FIG. 9a), respectively. State 1060 records the assistant's pronunciation of his or her full name and state 1062 saves it in the patient and assistant enrollment database 260. The system 100 provides an assistant identification number (AIN) at state 1064. The AIN is used similarly to the PIN in the access of files or records. The remaining states 1066-1090 are directed to the assistant also.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{278142=Here the meta function will find the number of complaints involving the gastro-intestinal system between Jun. 1, 1993 and Dec. 31, 1993. For example, if a patient consulted the MDATA system 100 once for abdominal pain, once for vomiting, and once for diarrhea, but each on a different occasion, the system would recognize that these are all problems involving the gastrointestinal tract., 287198=The meta function counts the number of complaints of headache between Jun. 1, 1993 and Dec. 31, 1993. If the number of complaints found (MC) is greater than or equal to 3., then the evaluation process branches to node 100; otherwise it branches to node 101., 277805=Here the meta function will find the number of complaints of headaches that occurred between Jun. 1, 1993 and Dec. 31, 1993., 279194=Here the meta function will find the number of complaints of headache that were found to be caused by infection between Jun. 1, 1993 and Dec. 31, 1993., 313462=A \u201ctele-stethoscope\u201d 780 is a device that allows the sounds a physician would hear through a stethoscope to be transmitted over the telephone. The tele-stethoscope 780 is functionally similar to that described in the 1992 Arthur D. Little report entitled \u201cTelecommunications: Can It Help Solve America's Health Care Problems?\u201d. The tele-stethoscope 780 permits the MDATA system 100 to greatly expand the spectrum of its sound analyses to include heart murmurs, the bruits of intracranial aneurysms, breathing sounds like the wheezes of asthma and the rales of congestive heart failure, or even the bowel sounds of an intestinal obstruction., 222242=At the completion of state 1006, i.e., the voice sample passes, the computer 102 continues process 276 at state 1005 wherein the operating mode is set to Real. The system 100 then advises the caller at state 1007 that new patient information will be saved to the patient's medical record., 47786=This application is a reissue of U.S. Pat.

The problems (complaints) caused by bacterial infection could be in different parts of the body.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the above detailed description has shown, described and pointed out the fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to various embodiments, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the device illustrated may be made by those skilled in the art, without departing from the spirit of the invention. When possible, the MDATA system 100 takes into account the past medical history of the patient, especially those pieces of information learned from past consultations with the MDATA system 100, before advice is given. In addition, the advice given is different depending upon the age and sex of the patient. The \u201cmeta\u201d functions provide another advantage by allowing the MDATA system 100 to evaluate a problem in the context of the patient's prior consultations with the system. An exact record of the questions asked and the answers given is stored in the patient's database. The MDATA system time-and-date stamps the responses to the questions (as transaction records) so that an exact reconstruction of the patient's interview(s) can be generated for use by a physician or other health care professional. The system also keeps a record of what version of an algorithm has been consulted as well as the sensitivity factor set for that consultation. At the conclusion of the interaction, the MDATA system can tell the patient how long the consultation has taken",
