            "Description",
            "PROCEDURE FOR SIMULTANEOUS TRANSMISSION IN TIME AND FREQUENCY OF MULTIPLE COMMUNICATIONS OF DATA BY MEANS OF OFDM MODULATIONS - Which permits to solve the problems relating to the interference produced among communications equipment of the same technology but belonging to different communications and which simultaneously use the same communications channel in time and frequency. It comprises modifying one of the parameters of the starting signal. The main advantage of the invention is that, in a simple way, it allows equipment to be correctly synchronised with the signals reaching it from its own network while ignoring signals of lesser power received from other networks using the same or different technology, without any need to carry out a complex and costly processing on reception.",
            "METHOD FOR INCREASING THE PERFORMANCE OF A COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM ON A MEDIUM FORMED BY MULTIPLE CONDUCTORS - Method for increasing the performance of a communications system on a medium formed by multiple conductors which increases the performance of a communications system by means of the creation of numerous communication channels with a high degree of isolation between each other on the same physical medium formed by multiple conductors. The method can be extended to be used in various applications, such as the reuse of frequencies on the same channel, the increase of the capacity of the point-to-point links in a network and the improvement of performance and reliability when used with digital processing of signals for transmission or reception, among others.",
            "Method for the spectral configuration of signals modulated by means of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ofdm) for an electrical network - A transceiver includes a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter receives a first orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal, and generates a first analog signal based on the first OFDM signal. The first OFDM signal has a first bandwidth, a first spectral position, and a first frequency spectrum. The first frequency spectrum of the first OFDM signal has a first set of frequencies with first amplitudes. The receiver receives a second analog signal, and generates a second OFDM signal based on the second analog signal. The second OFDM signal has a second bandwidth, a second spectral position, and a second frequency spectrum. The second frequency spectrum of the second OFDM signal has a second set of frequencies with second amplitudes. The transmitter varies the first bandwidth, the first spectral position, and the first amplitudes independent of the second bandwidth, the second spectral position, and the second amplitudes.",

The node comprises N independent AFEs. Each AFE is configured to receive or transmit the signal on a corresponding means of the N different means of transmission.",
            "PROCESS OF SYNCHRONIZATION IN THE TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN OF MULTIPLE EQUIPMENTS IN A TRANSMISSION SYSTEM WITH OFDM MODULATION - A system for determining a frequency error of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal having a first frequency. The system includes a plurality of filters configured to output a plurality of second signals, each of the plurality of second signals corresponding to a respective one of a plurality of different frequency bands of the OFDM signal.

The system is configured to determine the frequency error of the OFDM signal based on the synchronization symbols of the plurality of second signals.",
            "PROCEDURE FOR SIMULTANEOUS TRANSMISSION IN TIME AND FREQUENCY OF MULTIPLE COMMUNICATIONS OF DATA BY MEANS OF OFDM MODULATIONS - A system including a first network device, a second network device, and a third network device. The first network device is configured to transmit a first starting signal. The second network device configured to transmit a second starting signal, wherein at least one of the first network device and the second network device is further configured to change a ratio between at least one of respective phases of carriers of the first starting signal and the second starting signal and respective amplitudes of the carriers of the first starting signal and the second starting signal. The third network device is configured to receive the first starting signal and the second starting signal, selectively allow communication with the first network device based on the ratio, and ignore communication from the second network device based on the ratio.",
            "SIGNAL INJECTION THROUGH ELECTRIC NETWORK USING DIFFERENT MODES - A system including a coupler to couple a signal to a plurality of conductors of an electric network and a transmitter to select a plurality of modes to inject the signal into the plurality of conductors and to transmit the signal via the plurality of conductors. The plurality of modes is selected from a group consisting of a first mode, a second mode, and a third mode. The first mode includes injection of the signal through a selective combination of the plurality of conductors and circulation of current through ground. The second mode includes injection of the signal through a first conductor and return through a second conductor. The third mode includes injection of the signal through one or more first conductors and return through one or more second conductors. The first conductors are different than the second conductors."

In one embodiment, one of said arms makes up an arched area along most of its length which generates two points of support, a first point of support defined on the end of the joint affixing with the leg of the wheelbarrow and a second point of support defined in the area near where the two arms meet to define that angle. The arched area of the arm, positioned substantially horizontally and defining the two points of support, absorbs deformation, and also absorbs the load applied to the element, bringing more stability to the wheelbarrow on flat or irregular surfaces, providing a stabilizer comprised by each leg. 10-09-2008 Salvador Jaime, Rousset FR",
