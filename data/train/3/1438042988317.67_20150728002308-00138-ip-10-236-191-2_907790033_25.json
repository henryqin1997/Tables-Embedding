            "The campus safety could be a lot better. There are about 3 security guards that occasionally roam the parking lots to make sure students are ok. A lot of students have night classes and have to travel across campus by themselves and anything can happen to them during this time period.",
            "Greek Life isnt that popular at Auburn University at Montgomery. You have a few sororities and ferternaties but not a lot of people get involved in them.",
            "Auburn University at Montgomery will be great for students that want an education but don't want to spend that much money on their tuition. Also students that aren't that social and like low key enviorments will enjoy being at this university.",
            "There isn't much to do for fun at Auburn University at Montgomery. The wellness center is the only location where several students would go to have fun.",
            "The food that the cafe offers isn't bad but the school can provide the students with more options. The servers in the cafe are very rude also.",
            "The Dorm life experience is horrible. The dorms have leaks and the RA's are very strict. The only good thing about the dorms is that you can wash your clothes for free.",
            "The academic requirments are that high at this university. The professors are very leaniant and understanding. If you apply yourself more than likely you can pass all your classes with at least a B.",
            "Gaining a personal relationship with your professors will be a tremendous help. Their guidance can assit you in all aspects of learning. It would also be beneficial to find other students that are intreseted in your same major, you guys will be able to work with one another.",
            "Auburn University at Montgomery is a great school to attend for freshman students that are trying to live on their own and find themselves. The academic requirements aren't that challenging as long as you apply yourself. The professors and kind and willing to work with you."

Will enjoy being here the people at and around the college are great. i have lived in this area most of my life so i can tell you that Montgomery is not the most exciting city so you might find your self bored from time to time. Will learn a lot this college has one of the best business programs world wide, and coupled with the fact that most classes have 30 or less students in them the education is second to none.
