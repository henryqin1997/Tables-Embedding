Science professors often take an academically Darwinian approach to their courses. Someone I know scored a 1540 in two sections of the SAT, and got a C- in biology. Academic rigor is good, but when you apply to graduate school, you can't use the stringent grading system from Geneseo as an excuse for not having a stellar transcript., 191302=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 21461=Geneseo is great in that there is a place for everyone. Geneseo is the type of school where by the end of the first break in October, freshmen tell their parents they cannot wait to go back home. School is part of everyday life but it is the things that happen outside of class that make the experience. There are so many opportunities to make friends and find something to do on campus every day. There's a lot of good options for food, the residence halls are really nice to live in and the dorms themselves are nicely sized. The campus is small enough that walking to class isn't a big deal and if walking isn't your thing then the public transportation is really accommodating to most people's class schedules. Every aspect of Geneseo life can be praised, the only downside is the weather. But that is upstate New York, and nothing a good winter coat can't fix., 81561=food is available until 12:00 a.m. pretty good schedule, but do not expect delicious food. it is ok.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Though the college has been exploring more ethnic and healthier foods, there simply is not enough variety and the dining halls are often filled with greasy, fattening meals. Unfortunately, the best food on campus is the chocolate chip cookie. As a vegetarian the options are even more limited, though Geneseo does clearly label the vegetarian options and is sure to provide at least one option for vegetarians and vegans. The meal plans are highly inflated and not worth the money. Unfortunately, if you are living on campus you are required to purchase a meal plan, so there is no avoiding the food. The layouts of the dining halls are ineffective and lead to confusing lines and large crowds. It seems that every time Geneseo remodels a dining hall the only aspect that improves is the physical look of the room rather than the food being served. The inclusion of Starbucks in the College Union was a welcomed addition for a break from Geneseo CAS food. Overall, the food takes getting used to if you are not accustomed to greasy meals, but there are certainly ways of finding healthier options if you don't mind getting sick of the same few meals.
