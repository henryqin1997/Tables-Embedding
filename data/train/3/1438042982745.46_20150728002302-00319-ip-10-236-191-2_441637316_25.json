            "MULTI-CHANNEL GENERATING SYSTEM ON WIRED NETWORK - The present invention relates to a multi-channel provision system for a wired network. The multi-channel provision system of the present invention includes a tap-off unit (",
            "OPTICAL NETWORK DEVICE GENERATING MULTI-CHANNEL - Disclosed herein is an optical network device for generating a multi-channel. The optical network device is connected to a plurality of sectors. Each of the sectors has one or more subscriber terminals as component members, divides a frequency band assigned to a wired network, and provides resulting frequency bands to respective subscriber terminals. The optical network device includes one or more channel cards, and a media converter. The channel cards are mounted on a motherboard having a bus, and allow a frequency band, assigned to any one of the sectors, to be reused for at least one remaining sector in such a way as to provide an identical frequency band to the sectors at a node where the sectors branch off, thus generating a multi-channel for the frequency band. The media converter converts signals between an optical network and the motherboard.",
