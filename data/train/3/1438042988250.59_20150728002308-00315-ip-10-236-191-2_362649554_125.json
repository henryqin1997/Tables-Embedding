Usage Guidelines Use the address-family ipv4 command to configure IPv4 address family sessions in EIGRP and the address-family ipv6 command to configure IPv6 address family sessions in EIGRP. EIGRP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can be configured under IPv4 and IPv6 address family configuration modes after first entering VRF configuration mode. All commands in address family configuration mode can be configured in VRF address families except the autonomous-system and maximum-prefix commands. Task ID Task ID Operations eigrp",
