            "BYU has a lot of systems in place to ensure the safety of their students. Students at BYU tend to be more trusting than most people, and there are some in the world who take advantage of that. So, there are booths all around campus where at the touch of a button you can call a police officer to escort you across campus or home in the middle of the night. Also, you can sign up to receive text messages if there ever is a gunman or any other immediate danger on campus.",
            "At the beginning of the year, BYU holds a club fair so students can go and obtain information about each of the clubs. Each department has their own club, which is great if you need study partners or you are interested in learning more about the research in that particular field. But you don't have to be taking a class to join a club. You can join any club you'd like or just go to the social dancing club's activity one time for a great date!",
            "Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to be musically gifted to come to BYU! BYU is a great place for anyone who is smart, driven, interested in religion, or looking for a great place to make friends or meet that special someone.",
            "All of the buildings have their own nicknames or are called by their acronyms, ex. HFAC or SWKT (Swicket). When you come to campus, you also become familiar with places like the Duck Pond or Freshman Hill.",
            "Tuition is really low for such an amazing university, especially if you are a member of the LDS church. Most of it is paid for by church member's tithing, which is how it is able to be so low.",
            "The student center has a bowling alley to which each student gets one free game per semester. The athlete building has racquetball courts, a swimming pool, and all kinds of other recreational activities. The science building has interactive models that are fun to play around with and a planetarium with awesome light shows. Auditoriums all around campus can be scheduled for a movie night with your friends on the big screen. Every Tuesday is club night, and if you go to the science center, you can learn to dance or play ping pong. Or you can visit nearby attractions, like Trufalga or Seven Peaks or go see a movie at the dollar theater.",
            "I haven't actually been to the Cannon Center, but from what I hear it is quality food albeit fattening. Each of the freshman housing areas has its own creamery/grocery store, which is convenient but outrageously expensive. There is also a food court called the Cougareat on campus. And every building has its own set of vending machines if you need a quick snack and you don't want to wait in line.",
            "BYU is a very social place, with activities going on all day every day. And since everyone agrees to live by the honor code, you don't have to deal with drugs, drunkenness, inappropriate sleepovers, or any of the other awkward situations you might normally expect at a university. People are generally very friendly with each other and the resident assistants are very knowledgeable. Also, most of the housing is under good repair.",
            "How hard your classes are depends a lot on your major, but for most students BYU isn't a breeze. Luckily, though, the professors are very friendly and willing to help or have teaching assistants who will help you if you are struggling as well.",
            "College is just like high school, except you don't get participation points. You have to pay attention to what you are learning in your classes if you expect to do well on assignments and tests. Learn as much as you can about campus and the organizations offered there, because there are so many opportunities at BYU. You can meet professionals in all different fields, easily find a job or internship, or even just get free food or t-shirts on campus. Make time to go to devotionals. They are uplifting and just a good way to relax from the stress of the day. Plus, everything is closed on campus during devotional.",
            "This is a great religious school with a positive atmosphere. The teachers incorporate gospel doctrines with every subject taught in class, providing a well-rounded education. The social life is also very good, especially since everyone encourages each other to abide by the honor code and have clean fun."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{35181=Starting 2011 Fall semester, BYU is requiring the ACT with Writing for admission. Take it., 1102362=Every week on Tuesday the entire campus shuts down, I mean the entire campus, as faculty, staff and students flood to the Basketball stadium to listen to a weekly devotional speaker. Like a cross between heterozygotes, 3/4 the time it is a spiritual topic and the other 1/4 it is an academic topic. Regardless, the talks are amazing and inspiring. Plus you will never have a class Tuesday at 11:00. It's a great time to scope out some of the opposite gender., 406966=$2400 a semester! who wouldn't want that. housing ranges from heleman (being the traditional dorm) at around $700 a month to wyview being around $300 a month. wyview is the nicest apartment style living on or off campus for the price and condition it is in!, 310671=Tuition here is mega cheap! At only $2280 per semester for LDS students, and $4560 per semester for non-LDS students, you won't find tuition so cheap at a private college, especially if you're out of state. And, if you're a great student, you might likely get a half-tuition or full-tuition scholarship. Living on-campus is a little pricey compared to the cheapness of tuition, but it's definitely more than worth it! The meal plans are also excellent, and the food at the Canon center is delicious!, 506288=Great education in world-class programs for under $12,000 total cost per year. Tuition is around $2000 for LDS students and $4000 for non-LDS students per semester. The biggest cost is housing., 133179=just about anything you want to do (that doesn't break the honor code) you can! there is a club night with over 150 clubs that meet, so if you want to make friends or practice hobbies or skills, that's the night for you. there are so many events on campus that you don't want to miss, too! also, every tuesday at 11:00 am, all of campus shuts down for a university devotional or forum (depending on which week it is) where a faculty member or esteemed public figure will come and speak to the students. it is a great time to enjoy learning without being held responsible for homework or tests. it also builds campus unity and helps everyone to relax part-way through the week., 806948=every sunday at 10:00 pm, there is tunnel singing in a tunnel by the bell tower, by the marriott center. We sing hymns, and the boys announce their mission calls. Its pretty fun!, 717268=At 5:15 every night the flag is taken down and everyone on campus stops while the national anthem is played., 261114=This is definitely worth the money. Great value of education for what you pay. Tuition/housing/books for this next year (Fall 2011- Winter 2012) will be from 8,000 to 9,000 and that not bad. That actually something I could afford with a partial scholarship and working full-time over the summer. I'm not expecting my parents to pay any of this!, 877909=The cost of a full-time LDS student, per semester, is about $2300 and the cost of a full-time non-LDS student, per semester, is about $4600. Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's. So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities. For information on tuition at BYU-Provo, go to http://finserve.byu.edu/content/tuition-and-general-fees ., 291344=Based on the online student and staff reviews of my professors and classes, I anticipate learning a great deal while at BYU. I am especially excited to be able to select from a wide variety of classes to fit my own personal learning interests. Also, BYU's Harold B. Lee library is an amazing place to study (the best corner of the library is reserved for Freshmen only) with all sorts of resources and study pockets. In fact, it was rated in 2010 as the 3rd best college library in the USA., 276885=It's one of the cheapest private universities you can go to. Just around $2200 a semester? Not bad., 288685=Work hard, and familiarize yourself with BYU's acceptance criteria. The average accepted BYU student has a 3.8 GPA and a 27 ACT (1860 SAT equivalent). That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus. There are so many offices made specifically to help you research, write, and learn. Take advantage of the opportunities to learn outside of your classes. Go to the Eyring Science Center and take some time to read about the different displays. There are a lot of free events put on by the different departments. There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum. Now let's get to learning inside the classroom. Make friends with your classmates. Don't be afraid to contact your professor with questions about the material. Get enough sleep OUTSIDE of class. You are on your way to learning a lot., 797927=BYU is a university privately owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and as such the students are expected to adhere to a standard that most universities do not demand of their students. This standard, though sometimes seemingly silly, turns out to be a blessing to those who take academic life seriously and truly wish to do something with their lives. If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April. You may start school earlier than all of your other college friends, but at least you get a longer summer!}",
