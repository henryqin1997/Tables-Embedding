Some properties are set by the driver developer and do not normally require modification, while others can be modified by the administrator to change the routing behavior. For a complete description of these properties and available values, see DriverConfigPropertyNames in User Messaging Service Java API Reference. 2.3.1.9.2 Common Properties If you are using UMS behind a firewall, then you must configure proxy settings for WebLogic Server. For information about configuring proxy settings for WebLogic Server, see \"Using System Properties to Specify the Proxy Server\" in Oracle Fusion Middleware Getting Started With JAX-RPC Web Services for Oracle WebLogic Server. Limited Rate of Tweets: Twitter limits the usage of tweets per user. For information about all Twitter limits, see the About Twitter Limits page. If the rate limit of a user exceeds the rate limit of that Twitter user, then the delivery of outbound messages fail and the reception of inbound messages are ceased. Limited Size of the Tweet: Twitter limits the length of each tweet to 140 bytes. Any tweet exceeding this limit is rejected by the Twitter server.",
