            "Photosensitive Material Conveying System and Image Forming Apparatus - The photosensitive material conveying system is configured so that a feed out roller is contacted on a stack of sheets having a plurality of stacked photosensitive sheet films each of which is provided with an emulsion layer and a first protective layer provided on one side of a supporting base and a second protective layer provided on the other side with matting agent dispersed in the second protective layer, and the topmost sheet film in the stack of sheets is fed out by the rotation of the feeding out roller, wherein the matting agent has a spherical shape, a hardness softer than the first protective layer, and particle diameter in the range of 8 to 12 \u03bcm, and the contact pressure of the feeding out roller is 0.49 N/cm or less.",
            "CASSETTE TYPE RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGE SOLID-STATE DETECTOR - A cassette type radiographic image solid-sate detector that is an FPD compatible with a CR cassette thin-shaped with s sufficient strength, capable of preventing a housing from being deformed by external stress to deal with an external shock, and capable of portable radiography. The cassette type radiographic image solid-state detector comprises a detector unit including a scintillator layer for converting incident radiation into light and a signal detecting section for receiving the light obtained by the conversion by the scintillator layer and converting the light to an electrical signal, a housing including a housing body formed of carbon fibers and a first cover member and a second cover member covering openings of the housing body and containing the detector unit. The thickness of the housing in the direction of incidence of the radiation conforms to JIS Z 4905. At least one of the cover members is structured to be insertable into the detector unit.",
            "CASSETTE TYPE RADIATION IMAGE DETECTOR - Disclosed is a cassette type radiation image detector, serving as an FPD that makes it possible to achieve the digitalization of image data. The detector includes: a detection unit to detect incident radiation to generate radiation image data and a housing that includes a main section formed in shape of a rectangular hollow cylinder at both ends of which opening sections are provided, and a first covering member and a second covering member, each of which is engaged with the main section by using an engaging member, to cover each of the opening sections, and that accommodates the detection unit therein. The main section is formed in such a manner that a first direction of carbon fibers included in a radiation incident surface and a second direction of carbon fibers included in an opposite surface are inclined relative to the opening sections, respectively, and are different from each other."
