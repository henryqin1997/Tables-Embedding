            "Marist security can be spotted everywhere on campus. You never feel unsafe while you are on campus, and if there ever is a problem, security handles the situation in a professional matter.",
            "Marist provides you with an aducation that comes from hard work and dedication to your studies. The professors truly care not only about your grades but you as a person. Class sized are generally no more than twenty students which means professors know you by name, not by a number. Our beautiful campus is always well kept, and students truly respect our little paradise on the Hudson as well. Students as well as professors know that it is expensive to attend Marist, and no one takes that lightly. We are serious about our educations and know that coming to Marist, there is a bright future ahead.",
            "There is always a lot to do on campus. Being that we are right on the Hudson, students take advantage of the walking bridge, as well as hiking paths that connect right from the campus grounds. We are surrounded by great night life as well as campus activities that go on daily whether it is a sports game, musical production, or activity that campus activities creates.",
            "The food is good for the most part and there is a lot of variety. The quality of the food gets better each year and the staff truly listens to the students requests.",
            "Freshman dorms are just like any other dorm you can find at other colleges around the country, but each academic year,the housing gets better and better. As a sophomore you can already be living in an apartment or townhouse with your closest friends.",
            "Marist is building a reputation for producing well rounded students. As much as students here at Marist love to hang out with their friends, they take their academics seriously as well.",
            "You must learn to balance your academics with your social life.",
            "Marist has been the best experience in my entire life. The friends you will make will stay with you for the rest of your life. The professors can become your greatest supporters, and I believe that is why Marist graduates are working their dream jobs not only in this country, but around the world."

I'm a serious student who is part of the Honors' Program, received two Scholarships, and earned Dean\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2?s List for Fall 2013, my first semester! I've been invited to be a member of the prestigious Dean\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2?s Circle in Spring 2014., 230267=Marist is great when it comes to safety and security. There has never been a time where I felt unsafe on campus, even if it was 3:00 in the morning. There are blue-light systems in place pretty much everywhere you turn, as well as Marist security vehicles circling campus at all hours of the day, and a SNAP team of students who circle campus at night as well., 249565=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 196571=Freshman are required to have an unlimited dining plan. This means unlimited swipes into the dining hall and $25 of Thrifty cash which can be used at any of the cafes around campus. The food is not horrible. Summer 2013 is when they're actually redoing the dining hall and upgrading the food so I don't even know what it will be like when I go back in a week., 72551=Take advantage of every opportunity at Marist College including networking! Do your best in classes and develop relationships with your professors, if you are ever struggling in a class they will feel more inclined to help you knowing that you have asked for help and are willing to improve. Remember that at the end of the day the professors are in your corner and want to see you succeed. Develop friendships, acquaintanceships, and strong relationships with your professors and faculty members. College can be a lot to juggle with classes, and sports but balance wisely and do not be afraid to ask for help, even the most successful people have a team behind them. Also most importantly if you are looking to go to Marist College as a freshman apply to Marist's Freshman Florence Experience Program. It's an amazing year long program where a group of freshman (my 2013 freshman class had 45 students) get the opportunity to study abroad in Florence, Italy where you are immersed in the Italian culture. I not only learned traditional Italian meals thanks to my Italian cooking class (which counted as one of my science classes!) but I also learned how to travel without my family with me, learned how to budget my money responsibly and learned Italian! Trust me it is well worth it., 67291=Marist really does give you your bang for the buck. Marist has a variety of profession events that they host to concerts (last year in 2013 they had Big Sean come and perform!) it is a school that always has something going on for its students., 7018=If you are considering Marist be sure to attend a tour of campus, they are held regularly. Pack warmly for the winter season, the wind off of the Hudson is freezing in January, but the view is breathtaking. Marist is not a place to slack off, as most of the students are very smart and you will fall behind quickly if you don't try your best, but you will find that you have all the support you need if you ask for it.}",

Tips for prospective students If you are considering Marist be sure to attend a tour of campus, they are held regularly.

Bang for the buck Marist is expensive, especially for me as I went pretty far out of state. However, you get what you pay for; Marist is known for giving its students every resource available. the internship program is especially helpful, you can be sure that they will help you find the perfect internship (as many as you have time for!) , and that they will assist you in getting a job in the field of your interest. Am enjoying being here",
