            "AUGMENTED REALITY METHODS AND APPARATUS - Augmented reality methods and apparatus are described according to some aspects of the disclosure. In one aspect, a method of experiencing augmented data includes using a source system, emitting a dynamic symbol which changes over time, using a consumption system, receiving the emission of the source system, using the consumption system, analyzing the emission which was received by the consumption system to determine whether the dynamic symbol is present in the emission, and using the consumption system, generating a representation of augmented data to be consumed by a user of the consumption system as a result of the analyzing determining that the dynamically changing symbol is present in the emission of the source system.",
            "AUGMENTED REALITY AND LOCATION DETERMINATION METHODS AND APPARATUS - Augmented reality and location determination methods and apparatus are disclosed according to some aspects of the description. In one aspect, a location determination method includes accessing first location information regarding a location of a user interaction device in a physical world, wherein the user interaction device is configured to generate an augmented reality representation with respect to the physical world, using the first location information, identifying a plurality of wireless communication devices which are proximately located with respect to the user interaction device, initiating wireless communications between the user interaction device and the wireless communications devices, after the initiating, accessing information regarding the wireless communications of the user interaction device and the wireless communication devices, and using the information regarding the wireless communications, determining second location information regarding the location of the user interaction device, and wherein the second location information has increased accuracy with respect to the location of the user interaction device in the physical world compared with the first location information.",

In another embodiment a combination of physiological cooling agents is made in a modified release structure. The modified release/cooling agents combination is preferably obtained by physically modifying the properties of the combination of cooling agents by coating and drying. When incorporated into gum, these particles are adapted to enhance the shelf stability of the flavor and/or produce a modified release when the gum is chewed. In another embodiment, the physiological cooling agent is present with menthol and menthone.</td> <td>20080199565</td> <tr> </tr> <th>Published</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Patent application number</th> <tr> <tbody> <table class=\"preltab\" id=\"inv_tab_3667893\"> <h2>Lindell C.

    "textAfterTable": "Luke Richey, Fort Worth, TX US Patent application number Description Published 20140166912 Sliding Sleeve Having Contracting, Segmented Ball Seat - A sliding sleeve opens with a deployed ball. The sleeve has a seat disposed in the housing, and the seat has segments biased outward from one another with a C-ring or other biasing element. Initially, the seat has an expanded state in the sliding sleeve so that the seats segments expand outward against the housing's bore. When an appropriately sized ball is deployed downhole, the ball engages the expanded seat. Fluid pressure applied against the seated ball moves the seat into the inner sleeve's bore. As this occurs, the seat contracts, which increases the engagement area of the seat with the ball. Eventually, the seat reaches the shoulder in the inner sleeve so that pressure applied against the seated ball now moves the inner sleeve in the housing to open the sliding sleeve's flow port. 06-19-2014 Luke V. Richey, Fort Worth, TX US Patent application number Description Published 20150152709 BURST SLEEVE AND POSITIVE INDICATION FOR FRACTURE SLEEVE OPENING - A downhole tool, such as a sliding sleeve, deploys on a tubing string in a borehole. The tool has a housing with an internal bore and at least one port communicating outside the housing. An insert disposed in the bore can move from a closed position to an opened position relative",
