            "Gannon police circle the campus and are always close by. There are also blue boxes around the campus for emergencies.",
            "Gannon is big on greek life. Even if you are not in Greek they are still welcoming and are not the stereotypical greeks. There is a fraternity or sorority that fits almost everyone.",
            "The programs that are the most expensive will also give you the best salary once you graduate, so the money used to go to school will be paid back once you graduate.",
            "Gannon is right next to down town Erie, so there are little shops you can go to that are convenient. There are also restaurants down town that are not that expensive and taste pretty good too. The mall is only a 15 minute car ride away. The peer is about a mile away, so it is easy to walk to the light house and be by the water. There is a mini golf area near the peer as well. Presque Isle is also a car ride away, which is a fun place to go when it is warm. There are other things on or around the campus to do as well.",
            "The cafeteria is fine, there are different options so they should have something that you would want to eat. Doc's and Knight's Cove are also places to eat that are a good change up during the week.",
            "Finegan Hall is the best freshman dorm. It is not the nicest facility, but it is not gross. It is by far the most social dorm; if you are looking to meet new people definitely live at Finegan. It is not as expensive as North Hall because it is not as new, but no one spends much time in their room anyway. Go to the lobby, especially the first week because that is the best way to meet new people.",
            "Depending on your major the academic rigor will change. Gannon has many health science and engineering programs that are harder, but they are great programs and will get you the job you want.",
            "Live in Finegan Hall your freshman year. Find an older student you can talk to about college, preferably someone with your major. If you go to class and pay attention you will do fine in the class, so don't freak out about college being way more difficult than high school.",
            "Expensive, but worth the money. Filled with friendly people, both students and professors. Just the right size."

On campus the Activities Programming Board usually does different events every month and has something going on at least once a week if not more. Every month they show a movie that is popular and is just about to be released, so you get the pleasure of seeing it for free, before it's released on DVD. They bring in different comedians and celebrities to talk to you. We just had Matt Roloff from TLC's Little People Big World and that was a HUGE hit on campus. They also have craft nights and bingo nights, along with many other events. At the end of the year there is springtopia which is a week long of fun events scheduled all day each day to have last min fun before finals week starts. Every two years there is a big concert that is held featuring big name artists, such as Jason DeRulo, We The Kings, The Maine, Mayday Parade, The Fray, Andy Grammar, and Jacks Manequin. Off campus there is so much to do as well, there is events at the bayfront, 0.5 miles from campus in walking distance. There is Presque Isle State Park which is 5 miles from campus within running and biking distance. It has 11 beaches and fishing and plenty of other fun events. Downtown there are many bars and clubs to hit up if you are of age. There's also an ice skating rink as well as bowling alleys. Up the road a little ways is the Erie Zoo which is free on Sundays. And of course there is a large shopping mall, which is accessible by driving or taking the bus which is free with your student ID., 14031=Gannon at face value is relatively expensive. Financial aide is really good though, and once you get your award letter you can send a letter back with an argument to try and get more financial aide. I did this because I increase my SAT score the second time I took it and also increased my GPA my senior year. I ended up getting $1000 more per year!}",

Tips for prospective students GET INVOLVED!!! Keep in mind that you are going to college for academics, but if you sit in your room all day studying, you will be miserable at your college. Get to know people and make friends quickly. The more involved you are, the more people",
