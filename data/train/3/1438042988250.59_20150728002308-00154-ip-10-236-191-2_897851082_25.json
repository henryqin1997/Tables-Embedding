            "It may seem intimidating taking five classes every semester, but there is a tutoring center on campus to help you better understand any class material you may have a hard time learning while in the classroom.",
            "If coming as a transfer from another college register and attend a Transfer Tuesday event to receive appropriate care. And visit sporting events to become more acclimated with the layout of the college. Ask the questions as they come you, to make sure that you are receiving the attention you deserve as a student.",
            "I am a transfer student from Reading Area Community College. I registered and attended the campus on a Transfer Tuesday and immediately fell in love. I was treated as a family member and not like a business deal."

If you do not care about your grades then you will not get good ones. The teachers are sympathetic and reasonable and will help you in any way that they can. This school also has great Occupational Therapy, Athletic Training, Criminal Justice, and Nursing programs. Tips for prospective students Come visit the campus and check it out before you apply. I suggest checking out the campus schedule and coming on a day where there is either an activity or a game going on so you can get the true feel of what it is like here. Bang for the buck The tuition is a little high but it does have more of a private small school feel. It is a small campus so you get to know a lot of people and",
