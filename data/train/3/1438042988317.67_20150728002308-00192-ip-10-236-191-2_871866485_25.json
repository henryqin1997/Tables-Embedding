Doing so markedly decreases the number of exceptions and makes understanding the rules better. The origin of some of these phonological rules can be traced all the way back to Indo-European gradation (ablaut). This is especially common in explaining the differences between the infinitive and present stem of many verbs., 31315=This article will present the grammar of the literary language, which is in the main followed by most dialects. The main differences in the dialects are vocabulary with occasional differences in phonology and morphology. Further information can be found in the article Ukrainian dialects., 19707=The following points of Ukrainian phonology need to be considered in order to properly understand the grammar of Ukrainian., 32295=The grammar of the Ukrainian language describes the phonological, morphological, and syntactical rules of the Ukrainian language.

It consists primarily of feminine nouns, but a few nouns with these ending referring to professions can be either masculine or feminine. In these cases, the genitive plural is often formed by adding -\u0456\u0432. Nouns referring to people can also take this ending. First declension[edit] Nouns ending in a consonant are marked in the following tables with -0- (thus no ending). \u0439\u0456 gives \u0457 \u044c\u0456 gives \u0456 \u044c\u0443 and \u0439\u0443 gives \u044e \u0439\u0438 gives \u0457 \u044c\u0438 gives \u0456 \u0439\u0435 gives \u0454 \u044c\u043e gives \u0435 \u044c\u0430 and \u0439\u0430 gives \u044f Soft subgroup: Whenever a soft sign or the semi-vowel encounters the vowel of the ending, the following changes occur (These are mainly orthographic changes, but same can be traced to similar changes in Common Slavic): All \u0438 following a post-alveolar sibilant change to i. All o following a post-alveolar sibilant change to e. Mixed subgroup If the hard group endings are taken as the basis, then the following rules can be used to derive the corresponding mixed and soft endings: Most of the types consist of 3 different subgroups: hard, mixed, and soft. The soft subgroup consists of nouns whose roots end in a soft letter (followed by iotified vowel or soft vowel). The mixed subgroup consists of the nouns whose roots end in a post-alveolar sibilant or occasionally r. The hard",

(3) The genitive form is used for all animate nouns, while inanimate nouns take the nominative form. Second declension[edit] The second declension consists of masculine and neuter nouns. Masculine nouns: This group consists primarily of nouns, which end in a consonant, a soft sign, \u044c, or \u0439. In the masculine declension, nouns that end in \u0440 can belong to any of the three declension subgroups: hard, mixed, and soft.
