    "textBeforeTable": "Procedure In the Cisco UCS Manager CLI, there are no new commands to support Unified Ports. Instead, you change the port mode by scoping to the mode for the desired port type and then creating a new interface. When you create a new interface for an already configured slot ID and port ID, UCS Manager deletes the previously configured interface and creates a new one. If a port mode change is required because you configure a port that previously operated in Ethernet port mode to a port type in Fibre Channel port mode, UCS Manager notes the change. Changing the port mode on either module can cause an interruption in data traffic because changes to the fixed module require a reboot of the fabric interconnect and changes on an expansion module require a reboot of that module. If the Cisco UCS domain has a cluster configuration that is set up for high availability and servers with service profiles that are configured for failover, traffic fails over to the other fabric interconnect and data traffic is not interrupted when the port mode is changed on the fixed module. Caution Configuring the Port Mode A standalone configuration has only one fabric interconnect. After you make port changes to the fixed module, the fabric",
