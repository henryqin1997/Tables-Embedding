    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{10311=One issue with lowering the MTU on the virtual-template interface is that the IP MTU is automatically lowered as well. It is not possible to configure an IP MTU greater than the MTU on a virtual template interface. This can be an issue if there is a mixture of peer devices that do and do not adjust their MTU based on the advertised MRU. The clients that are unable to listen to MRU advertisements and adjust accordingly will continue to send full-sized packets to the peer. Packets that are larger than the lowered IP MTU, yet smaller than the normal default IP MTU, will be forced to fragment. For example, an L2TP packet that is 1490 bytes would normally be transmitted without fragmentation. If the MTU has been lowered to 1460 bytes, this packet will be unnecessarily fragmented. In this situation, it would be optimal to advertise a lower MRU to those clients that are capable of listening and adjusting, yet still allow full-sized packets for those clients that are unable to adjust., 19904=Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2, the VRF-Aware VPDN Tunnels feature adds support for L2TP on the LNS. The initiation and termination of tunnels in a VRF instance is supported on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers in both an LNS and Layer 2 Access Concentrator (LAC) environment., 10578=Because the default MTU for an interface is 1500 bytes, the default MRU is 1500 bytes. Setting the MTU of an interface to 1460 changes the advertised MRU to 1460. This configuration would tell the peer to allow room for a 40-byte L2TP header., 18638=Packets are fragmented when they attempt to pass through an egress interface with a maximum transmission unit (MTU) that is smaller than the size of the packet. By default, the MTU of most interface is 1500 bytes. Because of this default MTU size, TCP segments are created with a default payload of 1460 bytes, allowing room for the 40 byte TCP/IP header. Because L2TP encapsulation adds 40 bytes of header information, tunneled packets will exceed the MTU of an interface if MTU tuning is not performed., 12252=If you configure a lower TCP MSS than the usual default of 1460, the size of TCP segments will be reduced to compensate for the information added by the L2TP header.}",

For a list of the commands that can be used in VPDN template configuration mode, use the ? command in VPDN template configuration mode. An L2TP tunnel must be established for the VPDN template settings to be used. Once a tunnel has been established, changes in the VPDN template settings will not have an effect on the tunnel until it is brought down and reestablished. Note Creating a VPDN Template Perform this task on the NAS or the tunnel server to create a VPDN template. If you remove a named VPDN template configuration, all VPDN groups that were associated with it will automatically be associated with the global VPDN template.",
