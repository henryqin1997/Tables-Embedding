Usage Guidelines This command refers to the global identity policy that is configured on the device that contains the access policies that are to be applied. Only a single identity policy can be configured under the policy class configuration submode. If the identity policy is not defined on the device, an error is generated during the application of the policy. Examples The following example shows how create an identity policy called healthy_identity:  Router(config)# policy-map type control tag healthy_pmap Router(config-pmap)# class healthy_class Router(config-pmap-class)# identity policy healthy_identity Router(config-pmap-class)# end The following example shows how to add an access group called healthy_acl to the identity policy named healthy_identity:  Router(config)# identity policy healthy_identity Router(config-identity-policy)# access-group healthy_acl Router(config-identity-policy)# end Related Commands",
