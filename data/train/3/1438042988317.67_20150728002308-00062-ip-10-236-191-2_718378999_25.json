Dane Long set fast time, with nineteen others timing in under the 15 second mark. Robbie Johnston was shown as the lap one leader, as Ron Heeney charged to the front bringing Kyle Hayden along with him. Lap five saw Corey Davis and Ed Newman Jr. running side by side for fourth as Heeney took over the top spot on the next lap. Heeney continued to lead until lap 20 with Johnston peeking to the low side, while Dane Long sliced his way through the field. Heeney and Johnston ran side by side as Long watched for his opportunity to get around them. Johnston grabbed the lead on lap 23 with Long looking to move into the second position around Heeney. Mission accomplished on lap 26, with Tom Stone and Pat Dent rounding out the top five. Lap 32 saw Long move into the first position ahead of Johnston as Mike Ammerman entered the top five. Caution on lap 35 closed the field up giving Johnston another shot at Long. Johnston got a nose under Long and went to the point on",
