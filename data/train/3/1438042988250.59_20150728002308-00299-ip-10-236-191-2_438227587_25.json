(1965), \"A Note on the History of Mark-Recapture Population Estimates,\" The Journal of Animal Ecology, vol. 34 (June 1965), pp. 453-54, 60569=Notably, even the highest of these estimates suggests that currency holdings by U.S. residents are significant--at least $1,000 per person--a finding at odds with survey work on currency holdings.35 Feige (1996, 2012) suggests that underground economic activity could account for this discrepancy, though underreporting, especially by individuals with large cash holdings, is also likely a substantial problem., 5224=Despite the disparate methods and data sources, the data consistently indicate several trends. First, international demand for U.S. currency increased steadily over the 1990s and into the early 2000s, a period that coincided with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and periodic economic and political crises in several Latin American countries. Second, international demand for dollars began to stabilize or decline around the time of the introduction of the cash euro in 2002.3 This decline coincided with economic and political stabilization and financial modernization in many economies in and around the euro zone and the former Soviet Union and continued until late 2008, when the global financial crisis appeared to spark renewed demand for U.S. banknotes that has shown no sign of abating., 29048=While U.S. currency is used in, and is shipped to and from, many countries, a few areas stand out because of their size and their appetite for dollars in times of crisis. In Figure 8, the dashed red line indicates net commercial bank shipments to the two leading markets in this category, the former Soviet Union and Argentina. For all but the first and last few years of the period shown, or from about 1995 to 2008, these shipments more than fully accounted for all net commercial bank shipments. This phenomenon might also have been the case in the early part of the sample, but reporting in that period was not as detailed. As a result, shipments recorded with a destination of Europe might well have been sent to the former Soviet Union. In the early 2000s, net shipments to these markets declined as the financial conditions stabilized and as the need to use cash for saving and transactions has faded. In the past two years, though, global conditions as well as crisis and political uncertainty in these regions appears to have coincided with an upswing in demand for dollars.22, 542040=14.\u00a0\u00a0 On a Q4-to-Q4 basis, over 1980-2011, currency growth averaged 7\u00bc percent and nominal GDP growth averaged 5\u00be percent. Over 1990-2011, currency growth averaged 7 percent and nominal GDP growth averaged 4\u00be percent. Over 1999 to 2011, currency growth averaged 6 percent and nominal GDP growth averaged 4\u00bc percent.\u00a0Return to text, 540306=8.\u00a0\u00a0 In 2009, 151 million passengers arrived and departed on international flights at U.S. airports and about 200\u00a0million border crossings occurred by land (U.S. Census 2012).\u00a0Return to text, 21276=As noted earlier, U.S. currency growth has been strong even relative to nominal GDP. Figures 3 and 4 display the ratios of total currency to nominal GDP for the United States and Canada over the past half-century. Ordinary theories of money demand would predict that the ratio of income to currency, or velocity (the inverse of the ratio shown here) should vary positively with the opportunity cost of holding money. That is, in terms of these charts, higher opportunity cost would be associated with lower demand for currency relative to income. As cashless payments become more common and, presumably, more cost-effective, one might expect that, abstracting from movements in market interest rates, demand for currency relative to income should decline. Indeed, that pattern prevailed in the United States until about 1985, and in Canada generally for the period. The upturn in the U.S. ratio of currency to nominal GDP beginning in 1989 is thus anomalous and is consistent with substantial and growing external use of U.S. currency., 534876=Hellerstein, Rebecca, and William Ryan (2011), \"Cash Dollars Abroad,\" Federal Reserve Bank of New York Reports, no. 400. February 2011., 19920=One might look to Canada for evidence of what U.S. currency demand would look like without a foreign component. Canada has similar income levels, payments technologies, holiday patterns, and GDP growth rates to those in the United States, but little Canadian currency is believed to circulate externally. Figures 2A and 2B display Canadian currency in circulation by denomination in levels and growth rates from 1989 to 2011. As can be seen in Figure 2A, $100s are also prevalent in Canada, though less dramatically than in the U.S., accounting for just over half of Canadian currency in circulation at the end of 2011.19 Overall currency growth rates for Canada are, not surprisingly, driven less strongly by $100s and more strongly by $20s and $50s (not shown), the primary transaction denominations in Canada. Over the full half-century, the simple correlation between overall currency growth and growth by denomination is 84% for $100s, 86% for $20s, and 75% for $50s. More recently, however, the role of $100s has apparently declined, possibly as electronic payments have become more common. Correlations over this period are, respectively, 63%, 87%, and 70%., 534444=Feige, Feige (2012), \" New estimates of U.S. currency abroad, the domestic money supply and the unreported economy,\" Crime, Law and Social Change, vol. 57:3 (April 2012)., 44714=The results of the seasonal estimates for all currency abroad and for $100s through December 2011 are displayed in Figures 13A and 13B. As was the case in earlier work, these estimates are on the high end of the range. These estimates also show a quite different time series pattern relative to one another as well as relative to other flow-based measures, though the monthly measures generally indicate an upswing in the share of U.S. dollars held abroad., 533889=Bank for International Settlements (2012). Statistics on payment, clearing and settlement systems in the CPSS countries: Figures for 2010. http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss99.pdf, 538023=2.\u00a0\u00a0 Until late 2008, Federal Reserve notes, the dominant form of currency, were the primary liability on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. As a result, currency demand was thus a primary consideration in the conduct of daily open market operations as well as in longer-range planning related to the Federal Reserve's System Open Market Account portfolio. After late 2008, deposits of depository institutions (of which reserve balances are the vast majority) increased significantly and now exceed currency as a liability on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Appendix Figure 3 illustrates the major components of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet since 2003.\u00a0Return to text, 52961=Estimates using this method for $50 notes indicate similar patterns over time with somewhat lower shares abroad--about 40 percent at the end of 2011. When combined with the estimates for $100s, these estimates suggest that about $510 billion, or just over half of all U.S. currency in circulation was held abroad at the end of 2011: about $480 of the $780 billion in $100s and about $30 billion of the $70 billion in $50s in circulation., 473530=Figure A3: Federal Reserve Bank Assets and Liabilities and Capital, 2007 - 2012, 550327=35.\u00a0\u00a0 The most recent Survey of Consumer Payment Choice, conducted in 2009, indicates holdings of less than $100 per person (Foster et al., 2011).\u00a0Return to text, 54065=Table 1 presents coefficient estimates for a simple error correction model for the currency component of M2 estimated quarterly beginning in 1988, a date chosen for two reasons.34 First, 1988 marks the beginning of availability of the commercial bank shipment data as well as an apparent upshift in international demand for U.S. currency. Second, preliminary testing (not shown) indicates a distinct structural break in 1988. The regression model consists of two equations, one for the steady state and one for dynamics., 93630=Figure 5: Growth Rates of U.S. and Canadian Nominal GDP, 1960-2011, 124802=Figure 11A: Measures of Cumulative Flows of U.S. Currency Abroad, 1989-2011, 314=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers Number 1058, November 2012 --- Screen Reader Version*, 128933=Figure 11B: Cumulative Flows of U.S. Currency Shipped Abroad Relative to Cumulative Changes in Currency in Circulation, 1989-2011, 539651=6.\u00a0\u00a0 H.4.1 Statistical Release, tables 1 and 8. http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20111229/.\u00a0Return to text, 42894=Because of these shifts over time, I propose three approaches to measuring the seasonal amplitude. For each, I report results using two different seasonal adjustment procedures, X12-ARIMA and X12 with a shorter 3x1 smoothing window, shown in black and blue respectively. The first approach estimates the annual amplitude as the difference between the seasonal factor for December of one year and January of the next year. These estimates are associated with the year in which December falls and are shown in Figures 13A and 13B as the \"annual\" estimate, the solid lines. Second, one might choose to fix the months used to calculate the U.S. seasonal amplitude so that they are the same as the months used to calculate the Canadian seasonal amplitude for a given observation. For these \"monthly fixed\" estimates, shown as the dashed lines, the Canadian seasonal amplitude for a given month is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum seasonal factors calculated for the most recent twelve months. The U.S. seasonal amplitude for the same month is calculated as the difference between the seasonal factors in the same months as for the Canadian seasonal amplitude, and the monthly share of currency abroad is then estimated as the trailing average of the estimates for the past twelve months.28 A third approach is to estimate the seasonal amplitude each month as the difference between the maximum and minimum seasonal factors over the most recent twelve months, and then to estimate the monthly share of currency abroad as the trailing average of the estimates for the past twelve months. The estimates from this approach are shown in Figures 13A and 13B as the \"monthly\" short-dashed lines., 541455=13.\u00a0\u00a0 For researchers who do not have access to the shipment data, or for certain countries and time periods, the CMIR data can provide useful insights. Refer, for example, to Feige (1996, 2012) for analysis of the U.S. economy and to Kamin and Ericsson (2003) for analysis of dollarization in Argentina. For the latter analysis, CMIR data were both available over a longer time period and more reliable than usual because of the patterns of dollar flows to Argentina.\u00a0Return to text, 86839=Figure 4: Canadian Currency to Nominal GDP Ratios, 1960-2011, 50671=After these corrections, we estimated the \"population\" of notes in two \"pools\", domestic and foreign. The foreign \"pool\" includes either the New York and Los Angeles offices or the New York, Los Angeles, and Miami cash offices; the domestic \"pool\" includes all other offices.33 In addition, we produce two sets of estimates for the share of notes held abroad, one using the actual total quantity of notes in circulation, which is known, and one using the estimated total quantity of notes in circulation. By necessity, these estimates are calculated separately for 1990-series and 1996-series notes. Figure 14 displays the estimated share of $100s in circulation abroad for 1990-series notes, the red dashed line, for 1996-series notes, the blue long-dashed line, and for both types of notes, the solid black line, based on the estimated total stock of notes and based on the assumption that the foreign \"pool\" is the New York and Los Angeles offices. The estimates using the actual (known) total stock of notes are similar and converge over time, suggesting that the biometric method is better able to estimate the true total quantity of notes in circulation only after the design has been in circulation for a few years. Indeed, as shown in Figure 14A, the biometric method's estimates of total notes in circulation converge to actual figures and remain close., 49209=These estimates provide an update as well as some adjustments to previous estimates. The updates currently extend through the end of 2011. The adjustments are the result of corrections to anomalies in the processing data detected in the process of calculating the updates. In particular, recall that a key variable is the share of \"tagged\", or new-series notes in notes received at Federal Reserve Bank offices. In reviewing the data, we noticed that the processing data for some offices and months implied shares that were anomalous: The values were zero, one, or far away from either values in adjacent months or from values reported by other offices for the same month., 42277=In earlier estimates using this method, the peak month was December and the trough month was February of the following year. However, it seems that seasonal factor patterns have changed in the past several years, as illustrated in Figures 12A and 12B. December remains the clear peak, though its relative magnitude has varied over time. In particular, February is no longer the trough for U.S. currency in circulation. Rather, September is now the trough, though January seems to track the lower envelope of September and February. Moreover, January's seasonal factor is near the trough for Canada as well., 36697=While tracking movements in currency in circulation is the major object of operational interest, having an estimate of the stock of U.S. currency abroad is also important for various analytical and operational questions faced by the Federal Reserve. Figures 11A and 11B chart the stocks of currency in circulation implied by the flow measures presented earlier. In Figure 11A, each line represents the cumulative change in the item since the end of 1988, when currency in circulation was about $230 billion. As indicated by the thicker gray dashed line, total U.S. currency in circulation worldwide has increased by just under $800 billion since 1990. The most direct measurement, commercial bank shipments, the solid black line, suggests that $200 billion has moved abroad since 1990, which would put the total at between $200 billion and $400 billion, depending on the assumed initial value. The shipments proxy, the solid gray line, suggests that about $350 billion moved abroad over the period, putting the total at $350 billion to $550 billion.25 Finally, the adjusted shipments and proxy figures, the dashed black and gray lines respectively, suggest that about $550 billion moved abroad over the period, putting the total at $550 billion to $750 billion. These ranges are, of course, large, though the simple method proposed above in Section III.A.2 produces an estimate very close to the center of the range., 6124=In this paper, I present estimates of the stocks and flows of U.S. currency abroad from the early 1990s through the end of 2011. Section 1 reviews the available data sources, with a focus on their strengths and weaknesses for use in answering questions about the shares of banknotes held in the United States and abroad. Section 2 presents an overview of currency demand over the past several decades and some stylized facts about the composition of U.S. currency levels and changes over time. Section 3 builds on these stylized facts and presents simple and direct estimates of stocks and flows of U.S. currency abroad. Section 4 presents updates of two indirect estimates of stocks and flows of U.S. currency held abroad; these estimates are based on the data sources from Section 1 as well as additional information. Section 5 presents estimates of a very simple currency demand equation for the United States, from which estimates of the impact of international demand on currency growth can be derived. Section 6 summarizes these findings and concludes with some general observations and directions for further work., 535246=Judson, Ruth A., and Richard D. Porter (2010), \"Estimating the Volume of Counterfeit U.S. Currency in Circulation Worldwide: Data and Extrapolation,\" Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Policy Discussion Series PDP 2010-2., 546785=27.\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, Canadian and U.S. holidays are not identical: to give just two examples, Canada observes Thanksgiving in October and the U.S. observes it in November, and Canada's holidays include the day after Easter and the day after Christmas while these days are not generally holidays in the United States. Nonetheless, the broad outlines of holidays are very similar, especially at a monthly frequency.\u00a0Return to text, 1998=U.S. currency has long been a desirable store of value and medium of exchange in times and places where local currency or bank deposits are inferior in one or more respects. Indeed, as noted in earlier work, a substantial share of U.S. currency circulates outside the United States. Although precise measurements of stocks and flows of U.S. currency outside the United States are not available, a variety of data sources and methods have been developed to provide estimates. This paper reviews the raw data available for measuring international banknote flows and presents updates on indirect methods of estimating the stock of currency held abroad: the seasonal method and the biometric method. These methods require some adjustments, but they continue to indicate that a large share of U.S. currency is held abroad, especially in the $100 denomination. In addition to these existing indirect methods, I develop a framework and basic variants of a new method to estimate the share of U.S. currency held abroad. Although the methods and estimates are disparate, they provide support for several hypotheses regarding cross-border dollar stocks and flows. First, once a country or region begins using dollars, subsequent crises result in additional inflows: the dominant sources of international demand over the past decade and a half are the countries and regions that were known to be heavy dollar users in the early to mid-1990s. Second, economic stabilization and modernization appear to result in reversal of these inflows. Specifically, demand for U.S. currency was extremely strong through the 1990s, a period of turmoil for the former Soviet Union and for Argentina, two of the largest overseas users of U.S. currency. Demand eased in the early 2000s as conditions gradually stabilized and as financial institutions developed. However, this trend reversed sharply with the onset of the financial crisis in late 2008 and has continued since then., 533455=Allison, Theodore E., and Rosanna S. Pianalto (1997), \"The Issuance of Series-1996 $100 Federal Reserve Notes: Goals, Strategies, and Likely Results,\" Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 83 (July), pp. 557-64., 546244=25.\u00a0\u00a0 The proxy is the only measurement available before 1988. It indicates that $40 billion moved abroad over the period from 1974 to 1989; during that time, currency in circulation increased by about $180 billion.\u00a0Return to text, 38192=Finally, Figure 11B displays the cumulative flow measurement and estimates as a share of the cumulative increase in currency in circulation at each point in time. Again, the estimates are disparate, but indicate some common trends, including a strong role for international demand in the 1990s, a waning role in the early 2000s, and a resurgence in 2008. In this Figure, as earlier, the role of the former Soviet Union and Argentina is likely understated because of poor data coverage in the shipment data in the early 1990s., 17694=In value terms, the driving force over this period has generally been growth in the $100 denomination, as can be seen in Figures 1A and 1B.16 Figure 1A presents annual end-year data on U.S. currency in circulation by denomination from 1989 to 2011. At the end of 2011, U.S. currency in circulation totaled about $1 trillion, of which nearly $800 billion, or just over three quarters, was in the $100 denomination.17 Figure 1B presents annual growth rates for the same items, on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis. The overall growth of currency, the solid black line, moves closely with, though generally more slowly than, the growth of $100 notes, the dashed purple line. The correlation of overall currency growth with $100s over this period is over 0.9; correlations with the other denominations are generally decreasing in the denomination. The correlation for $1s is about 0.2., 538805=3.\u00a0\u00a0 The euro currency was introduced as a unit of account in 1999; the physical currency was introduced in 2002.\u00a0Return to text, 536893=U.S. Census Bureau (2011), Statistical Abstract of the United States 2012. Washington DC: U.S. Government Printing Office., 542643=16.\u00a0\u00a0 In piece terms, however, U.S. currency is dominated by smaller denominations. As of late 2011, $1s were 32% of notes in circulation, $2s to $10s were 16%, and $100s were 25%. Appendix Figures 1A and 1B provide a breakdown of U.S. and Canadian currency by denomination in value and piece terms.\u00a0Return to text, 77434=Figure 2B: Annual Growth, Canadian Currency, 1989-2011, 13794=In principle, the most obvious direct source of information on U.S. currency flows across U.S. borders should be the Currency and Monetary Instrument Reports (CMIRs), which are compiled by the U.S. Customs Service. Individuals and firms making almost any shipment of more than $10,000 in cash across a U.S. border are required to file CMIRs, so these reports should be quite comprehensive and informative. However, as noted in Treasury (2006), CMIRs are neither accurate nor thorough measures of large cash shipments outside the banking sector due to three shortcomings: a generally one-sided system for collecting data, the omission of some potentially large volumes of currency flows, and the inability to accurately reflect flows to international custodial holding sites for U.S. currency. First, all individuals entering or leaving the United States are required to complete a CMIR if they are carrying more than $10,000 in currency or monetary instruments. In practice, though, customs formalities, including a specific question about currency and monetary instruments, are required for individuals entering the United States, but not for individuals exiting the United States.11 As a result, it seems plausible that underreporting is more likely for outbound travels. Second, even if all travelers were to report accurately, the CMIRs require no reporting for sums below $10,000; in aggregate, these sums could be considerable. As noted above, 151 million passengers arrived and departed on international flights at U.S. airports and about 200 million border crossings occurred by land in 2009 (U.S. Census 2012). Third, the CMIRs do not account properly for shipments to international custodial holding sites for U.S. currency. These sites, known as Extended Custodial Inventories, or ECIs, are secure locations outside the United States at which U.S. currency is held in custody for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Shipments to these sites are recorded in U.S. Customs data when they physically exit the United States, even though they remain in the custody of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Thus, for example, a shipment to an ECI in Switzerland will be recorded as a shipment to Switzerland on the day it occurs even though the currency is not in circulation.12, 534662=Foster, Kevin, Erik Meijer, Scott Schuh, and Michael Zabek (2011), \"The 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice,\" Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Discussion Paper 11-1., 73603=Figure 2A: Canadian Currency Levels, 1989-2011, 47268=The Federal Reserve introduced new-design $100 notes in 1991 and in 1996; a further redesign for the $100 note has been announced, but the issuance date has not yet been announced.30 From the moment each new design was issued, all new banknotes paid out were of the new design. These notes were defined as the \"marked\" or \"tagged\" notes. Following the analogy to the biologists' technique, the second sample of notes occurs when notes are returned to the Federal Reserve for processing. Notes returned to Federal Reserve Bank cash offices are authenticated and evaluated for fitness for further use; data on these processing operations are kept by series.31 We focus on $100 notes here because they are the most significant in dollar value and in the international market., 56003=Table 1: Quarterly Error Correction Regression Results Dependent Variable: Growth of Seasonally Adjusted Currency Component of M2 Quarterly, 1988:1 - 2011:4, 79929=Figure 3: U.S. Currency to Nominal GDP Ratios, 1960-2011, 27571=We now turn to the information provided by direct measurements of currency flows. Figures 7 through 11 display annual data on the primary measurements of cross-border currency flows in dollars, the international commercial bank shipment data described in Section I.B.1. Beginning with Figure 7, the solid black line indicates net commercial bank shipments and the dashed blue line indicates the total change in currency in circulation each year.20 Focusing only on the solid black and blue dashed lines, several features of the data stand out. First, reflecting the strong influence that international demand has on overall U.S. currency demand, the two series generally move in parallel, though the gap widens in the early 2000s and narrows in the most recent years. Second, the spike seen in total currency in circulation, the blue dashed line, is absent in the shipment flows. This feature of the data reflects the fact that a large share of the runup in holdings of currency immediately prior to the century date change (that is, in the final weeks of 1999) was held in commercial bank vaults and was then returned to the Federal Reserve early in 2000. Thus, while the currency was technically \"in circulation\" in the sense that it was held outside the Federal Reserve, the bulk of it never went to bank customers.21, 71100=Figure 1B: Annual Growth of U.S. Currency, 1989 - 2011, 35974=Figures 7 through 9 display nominal values, which can be misleading even in a period with relatively low inflation. Figure 10, therefore, displays all of the same series as in Figures 7 through 9, but scaled by the stock of currency in circulation at the end of the previous year, or the approximate percentage-point contribution to currency growth that would be implied by each of these measures. While the measures certainly vary, they generally point to strong contributions from foreign demand in the early to mid-1990s, a slowing in the mid-2000s, and a resurgence beginning in 2008., 539868=7.\u00a0\u00a0 The locations and boundaries of the twelve Federal Reserve districts were set when the Federal Reserve was established in 1913. Within each district, cash processing occurs at one or more cash offices. The number and location of these offices varies over time. Processing data are reported separately for each office.\u00a0Return to text, 435612=Figure 15B: Estimated Foreign and Domestic Contributions to Currency Increases, 1988-2011, 67097=Figure 1A: U.S. Currency Levels, 1989 - 2011; Figure 1B: Annual Growth of U.S. Currency, 1989 - 2011, 52162=Because of the timing of the introduction of the series of notes, it is difficult to assess the trend in the share of $100s abroad in the late 1990s, but both sets of estimates show a general decline in the share of $100s abroad beginning in the late 1990s, from somewhere between 65 and 72 percent to a bit under 58 percent by about 2007. As in the flow data, the biometric method indicates a sharp turnaround in late 2008; this method now indicates that about 62 percent of $100 notes were in circulation abroad at the end of 2011. Estimates using the New York, Los Angeles, and Miami offices as the foreign pool are about 5 to 10 percentage points lower; however, as with the shipment flows discussed earlier, it is difficult to know how to interpret consistently negative inflow data., 535905=Petersen, C.G. Joh. (1893), \"On the Biology of Our Flat-Fishes and on the Decrease of Our Flat-Fish Fisheries,\" Report of the Danish Biological Station, vol. 4, 1893., 26925=These two estimates of U.S. currency abroad are displayed in Figures 6A and 6B. The GDP-based estimates, the solid lines, suggest that about half of all U.S. currency, and about 65 percent of $100s, were held abroad as of the end of 2011, for a total value of about $500 billion. Over the past two decades, these estimates point to a sharp runup in external demand for U.S. currency beginning in the late 1980s, a brief pop in 1999, a decline beginning in 2003, and a resurgence in 2008, all patterns consistent with the overall growth of U.S. currency., 444812=Figure 15C: Estimated Cumulative Contributions of Domestic and Foreign Factors to U.S. Currency Increases, 1988 - 2011, 550592=36.\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, weekly data, reported in Appendix Figure 2, show an unmistakable turnaround in demand patterns in the middle of September 2008.\u00a0Return to text, 454321=Appendix Figure 1: Shares of U.S. and Canadian Currency in Circulation By Value and Pieces 2011 Average, 548657=32.\u00a0\u00a0 The 1990-series notes incorporated microprinting and a security thread but retained the same portrait and the same size and location for the portrait. The 1996-series design changes included a larger portrait moved off the center of the note.\u00a0Return to text, 18809=Figure 1B begins to reveal some general patterns in overall currency demand. In particular, currency growth was quite strong in the early 1990s, which coincided with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. After a brief lull in the mid-1990s, currency growth picked up again in the late 1990s, driven by crisis in Argentina in 1997 and then concern about Y2K in 1998 and 1999. Following a dip in currency demand in 2000, which largely reflected the return early in 2000 of precautionary stocks accumulated late in 1999, demand was boosted in the early 2000s by the events of September 11, which, judging by outsized commercial bank shipments, led to strong overseas demand for currency in the short run and, in the longer run, the apparent accumulation of precautionary stocks at home and abroad. Demand then slowed over the mid- to late-2000s until the sharp reversal seen in late 2008.18, 48207=The assumption that the \"marked\", or new-series, notes are just as likely to be returned to Federal Reserve offices as older-series notes is quite strong. It is likely more accurate for the 1990-series notes than for the 1996-series notes because the 1996 series was a much more obvious design change: to the extent that dollar users might prefer one series to another, that preference might be stronger for the series with a more significant design change. As with other assumptions, though, the sources of error for this assumption could affect the estimates in either direction: older notes might be underrepresented in Federal Reserve receipts if they are hoarded, or out of active circulation, or they might be overrepresented if dollar users prefer to retain newer notes.32 Much more detailed processing data would be needed to analyze these questions., 424643=Figure 15A: Growth of Currency, Nominal GDP, and Proxy for Foreign Demand, 1988-2011}",
