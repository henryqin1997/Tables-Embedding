The manufacturer does not provide any additional extras, like recovery or driver media. The preinstalled Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit operating system is mostly free of annoying tool bars or trial versions, but all the useful standard programs like Adobe's Acrobat Reader or Microsoft Office 2010 (starter edition) are on board. In addition, there are a couple of more or less useful manufacturer tools. The HP Security Assistant lets the user manage passwords or create backups; the Connection Manager provides an overview of network connections., 110377=The\u00a0RAM\u00a0is specified at a minimal\u00a04 GB\u00a0(1 module of DDR3-1600 made by Hynix), and the\u00a0320 GB hard disk\u00a0is also a common choice for entry level notebooks. At least, HP also provides a\u00a032 GB SSD cache, which should increase responsiveness.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{16812=As specified by AMD, HP runs the 480 shader units at 600 Mhz, and connects 2 GB of\u00a0DDR3 VRAM (900 Mhz) via the 128-bit memory interface. Overall, the HD 7670M reaches about the same level of performance as an\u00a0NVIDIA GeForce GT 620M/630M, which ranks in the lower midrange. In the performance preset of\u00a03DMark 11, the final score was\u00a01172 points\u00a0- similar to the\u00a0Zenbook UX32VD, but with its speedy\u00a0GeForce GT 640M, the\u00a0Timeline Ultra M3-581TG\u00a0leads by more than 50 percent.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Compared to the\u00a0HD Graphics 4000, the 7670M has a comfortable advantage of between 50 and 100% that also comes through in practice. In line with expectations from the synthetic 3DMark test, in games, too, the graphics card performs pretty much on par with the\u00a0GeForce GT 620M, which makes it see eye to eye with the\u00a0Aspire V5-571G: Many current games, like\u00a0Deus Ex: Human Revolution\u00a0or\u00a0Anno 2070\u00a0are playable at the display's native resolution of 1366x768 pixels and medium detail settings. Particularly demanding titles, such as\u00a0Alan Wake, may require somewhat reduced settings, while older or less complex games like\u00a0FIFA 12\u00a0leave some performance reserves, that can be used for additional features such as anti-aliasing or anisotropic filters. The\u00a0Radeon HD 7670M, as well as the identical\u00a0HD 6650M\u00a0have made it to our test bench several times - you will find the corresponding bench marks in our\u00a0GPU database.

    "textAfterTable": "Emissions System Noise The warm summer weather of recent weeks has lasted throughout our test, so the HP Envy 6 had to undergo the following measurements under outside temperatures of 25 to 26 degrees centigrade. As a result, the fan was already spinning relentlessly at\u00a0idle, but keeping fairly quiet at about 33 dB(A) Under\u00a0load, the fan spins up much higher, and reaches up to\u00a040.4 dB(A). Thanks to its constant speed and a sound frequency that's subjectively not too bothersome, this level of noise seems acceptable and in line with expectations given the slim construction and the decent performance. Comparable notebooks like the\u00a0Gigabyte U2442N\u00a0or the\u00a0Acer Aspire M3-581TG\u00a0got sometimes considerably louder during our stress test. Noise Level Idle 33 / 33 / 33.1 dB(A)",
