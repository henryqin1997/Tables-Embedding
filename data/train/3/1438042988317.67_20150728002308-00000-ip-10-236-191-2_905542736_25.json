It will be a lot of work, but it will also be the most amazing learning experience of your life. Also, be prepared to be challenged and uplifted in your faith by both students and faculty. Finally, if you love sports, this is the place for you. On average a student participates in 2.3 Intramural sports...not including club and varsity., 82695=Hard, Hard, HARD! The classes cannot be compared to other school's classes. The tests are killer. The professors know their stuff and they aren't afraid to test you on what they taught. Grove City College - where your best hasn't been good enough since 1876., 13823=From Grove City's website: U.S. News & World Report has again ranked Grove City College the No. 1 Best Value in its category for the 2007 guide. This year marks the fifth year in a row that Grove City has been named in the top spot. As a student at GCC, I will say that there is a reason for this. I am learning a ton here, I am confident that I am getting a phenomenal education, and tuition (plus room & board) is less than $10,000 a semester. Compared to what you'd pay at another private school for a comparable education, that price is an absolute steal., 70033=Grove City College: Where your best has not been good enough since 1873.

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck You can't find a better college for a better price. Both of my roommates decided to come here because they couldn't find a better college in their state - even though they're all the way from California! Am enjoying being here I have made so many great friends and it seems like everyone is there to help you out. There are tons of activities to choose from, whether it be sports, swing and ballroom dancing, worship, theater, or music. Every weekend, it seems, there is some event such as talent shows, Whose Line, dances, special speakers, and movie reviews. Am learning a lot I am learning so much more than I did in high school. It seems as though the information is presented in a clearer way and it is more applicable to to life in general.
