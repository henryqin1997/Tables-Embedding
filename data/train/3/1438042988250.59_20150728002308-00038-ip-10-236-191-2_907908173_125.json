            "New York is made out to be incredibly scary. Especially New York City, but I felt pretty safe walking around, even by myself.",
            "Tisch is great for students who want to be in the entertainment industry. Whether you want to perform, produce, etc. There have been plenty of now-famous people who attended Tisch!",
            "It costs a LOT of money to attend, but if I had it I'd say it's totally worth it.",
            "It's New York. I think that's self-explanitory.",
            "The food they gave us at orientation was ridiculously good!",
            "We got to stay in the dorms during orientation, and I have to say I was pretty impressed.",
            "Everyone there is intimidatingly smart, but it also makes you feel smart for being one of them haha.",
            "Go to the earliest possible orientation you can. You can get into some awesome classes!",
            "I went to visit NYU for orientation and I freaking loved it! The only thing keeping me from attending right now is the tuition costs. It is beautiful, fun, lively, helpful, social, and just all-around awesome!"

I wasn't very enthusiastic before I came to NYU, even though I had accepted a few months ago. I wasn't even enthusiastic in August, the few weeks before I came to New York. I was terrified and starting to wonder if I'd made the right decision for me. That all changed the first week. I made friends, I met super interesting and creative people, I explored the city, and I was energized. There's nothing like being in New York City with amazing people in your college years. You have the whole world ahead of you, and the city isn't as scary as it seems (coming from someone whose hometown has 8000 people)., 13972=Academically speaking, New York University is somewhat of a hodgepodge in quality between its different schools, so make sure you apply to the right one with the right credentials. Among its more renowned branches include: The Tisch School of the Arts: Founded and supported by the late Laurence Tisch (who, by the way, graduated from what is now Stern) and his family, the Tisch School is known as the #1 film school in the U.S. That said, If you're applying here, make sure you've got artistic chops. You will need a strong portfolio that should blow people away with its creativity and uniqueness, and know that you are competing against the best amateur film makers and artists around the globe. On the bright side, standardized scores and figures aren't emphasized, so a low GPA and SAT aren't that hazardous. Known graduates include Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone, and even Angelina Jolie. Left-handedness is preferred. The Stern School of Business: Known for producing investment bankers that go on to work for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc, the Stern school is filled with people with great mathematical skills with good GPA's and high SAT scores. Aim for a > 3.6 GPA, > 2100 SAT and > 720 on SAT II's. Known graduates include: John Paulson, Robert Soros, Alan Greenspan. NYU's College of Arts & Sciences is a bit trickier than the other two schools, but its strong points include the Courant Department of Mathematics (#1 in applied math, USNWR), Philosophy and Economics. You can study anything here and the requirements are significantly lower than the previously mentioned schools. Aim for >3.4 GPA, >1900 SAT, >650 SAT II's. Gallatin is the school where you can create your own major. You have access to every course at NYU, so you can mix and match things around and end up as a specialist in Indian Agriculture. While the atmosphere here is extremely liberal, I would advise against applying to this school unless you are very independent. Keep in mind, if you wanted to major in Finance or a something in NYU's specialized schools (Tisch & Stern), you would have to do an internal transfer. Requirements are about the same as CAS Polytechnic is the new engineering branch for NYU. Since the school has just been incorporated in to the system, I expect that its requirements would be a little lower than CAS. There you go, a whirlwind tour of NYU's departments. Good luck on your application., 778748=I believe theres about 1000 clubs to choose from, you'll find something!, 244778=Not an unusual tradition, but the 2011 welcome week dance was Lady Gaga themed - called the Monster Ball. People went all out for this dance - some friends and I actually made our dresses out of duct tape!, 754581=Types of students that don't want the typical college experience of going to sports games and everyone in NYU attire. it's great for hipsters, people who march to their own drum, girls who are independent and like to dress up for class, and definitely international students., 538159=During May, there is what is called NYU Strawberry Festival. Basically, it is a celebration of springtime. Many free things are handed out, there is music, and you can see the very long strawberry cake that they have for you taste., 342810=It varies from hall to hall. Weinstein has the only Chick-Fil-A in the city (as of 2014 anyway). There's also a Subway and Jamba Juice in Weinstein. There's also an on-campus Starbucks that accepts Dining Dollars (a component of the NYU meal plan that all freshmen are required to sign up for). Palladium has an awesome all-you-can-eat Sunday brunch with a chocolate fountain, a bagel bar (bagels, smoked salmon, a few types of cream cheese, and scallions), fruit bowls, omelettes, and of course, cereal, eggs, and tater tots. Third North is supposed to be the worst dining hall, but I think we have it pretty good here if people say that. I always see a lot of people at Third North, and I personally like it. The pizza is the best of NYU (in my opinion), and their breakfast wraps are amazing. They also have incredibly addicting chocolate chip cookies. I swear, you can't stop at one. You have to have at least two cookies., 337289=There's a public safety bus that will take you from any NYU location to another from 12:00-7:00AM (I think those are the hours, I forget when the morning ones end). It's also very safe around campus though. There are scattered police on the streets. There are also other students. In general, Greenwich Village (where NYU is located) is a nice area of NYC. Just don't be stupid and you'll be fine. I usually walk back from the library with friends anyway because I don't like walking alone., 705191=Depends on how much tuition is for you, but the teachers here will make it worth your while. The only slight negative effect is that NYU has plans to expand their campus by 2031, and there's a lot of money being diverted to renovations and other things, all which take away from the scholarships that NYU offers. Look for other scholarships at Cappex!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The learning portion is inevitable, isn\u2019t it? NYU has various schools underneath its purple umbrella \u2013 College of Arts and Science, Tisch School of the Arts, Stern School of Business, Steinhardt School of Culture/Education/Human Development, College of Nursing, Silver School of Social Work, Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality/Tourism/Sports Management, the new Global Liberal Studies Program, and the Liberal Studies Program. No matter what your interests or professional aspirations are, there is a school for you. If none of them quite fit the bill, there\u2019s the Gallatin School of Individualized Study where you can design your own program of study. NYU, with its rigorous curriculum, will give you a well-rounded education. You will be well-versed in the ways of the world \u2013 through the courses for your major and the core curriculum: The Morse Academic Plan. My course load this past year consisted of various classes in different areas \u2013 Art History, Music Business, Game Theory, Anthropology. They were taught by some of the most experienced and expert faculty. Although I\u2019m not a hugely Science-oriented person and I didn\u2019t find my Natural Science course interesting at all times, the course definitely heightened my knowledge in the area. Overall, my courses were stimulating, challenging, and interesting. Login to rate or flag the reviews Imran from Plainsboro,",
