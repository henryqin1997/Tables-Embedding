I have more fun in my own house than the dorms at college. Plus people mess with your belongings constantly and quiet hours are enforced at 11 o'clock. I feel like I'm being babysat all the time., 26200=Community time: On Wednesdays, from 1:00-2:30, there's community time. There aren't any classes during this period, so many events are held during this time. Quaker-style meetings: Some gatherings choose to use the Quaker method of meetings which includes a moment of silence to begin and end the meeting., 42644=During the month of April, there is something called Serendipity. What this is, is bands come and play concerts all over the campus. Food, drinks, games and parties are involved., 173296=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Will enjoy being here It's a really small campus and I really liked the fact that even though it was smack dab in the middle of a big place like Greensboro, it feels like it is its own little island. The campus is gorgeous and there are lots of environmentally friendly buildings. There's lots of clubs to get involved in, everything from the Pagan Mysticism Club to Biohazard Ultimate Frisbee. Greensboro is also a really cool city and there's always something to do, if not in Greensboro, a little ways away in Winston-Salem, Durham, Asheville, Raleigh and Chapel Hill. Academic Rigor the classes are really small and all of the teachers are very caring. they really get involved in your education and are always available to help you when you need it. everyone seems so passionate about what they're doing and the facilities are amazing.
