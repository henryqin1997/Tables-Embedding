Fluorescence anisotropy in polarized light varies as a function of the amount of rotational motion that the labeled candidate inhibitor and/or binding agent undergoes during the lifetime of the excited state of the fluorophore, such that the anisotropies of free and fully bound candidate inhibitor and/or binding agent can be usefully employed to determine the fraction of candidate inhibitor and/or binding agent bound to MIF in a given set of experimental conditions, for instance, those wherein a candidate agent is present (see, e.g., Lundblad et al., 1996 Molec.

For the purposes of administration, the compounds of preferred embodiments may be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions of preferred embodiments comprise one or more MIF inhibitors of preferred embodiments (i.e., a compound of structure (Ia) or (Ib)) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent. The inhibitor of MIF is present in the composition in an amount which is effective to treat a particular disorder, that is, in an amount sufficient to achieve decreased MIF levels or activity, symptoms, and/or preferably with acceptable toxicity to the patient. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions of preferred embodiments may include an inhibitor of MIF in an amount from less than about 0.01 mg to more than about 1000 mg per dosage depending upon the route of administration, preferably about 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, or 0.9 mg to about 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 300, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, or 900 mg, and more preferably from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, or 25 mg to about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 mg. In certain embodiments, however, lower or higher dosages than those mentioned above may be preferred. Appropriate concentrations and dosages can be readily determined by one skilled in the art., 404724=[0179] In certain embodiments, the fluorescence energy signal is a fluorescence polarization (FP) signal. In certain other embodiments, the fluorescence energy signal may be a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal. In certain other preferred embodiments the fluorescence energy signal can be a fluorescence quenching (FQ) signal or a fluorescence resonance spectroscopy (FRS) signal. (For details regarding FP, FRET, FQ and FRS, see, for example, WO97/39326; WO99/29894; Haugland, Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals-6th Ed., 1996, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, Oreg., p. 456; and references cited therein.), 250178=[0005] The interest in developing MIF inhibitors derives from the observation that MIF is known for its cytokine activity concentrating macrophages at sites of infection, and cell-mediated immunity. Moreover, MIF is known as a mediator of macrophage adherence, phagocytosis, and tumoricidal activity. See Weiser et al., J. Immunol. 147:2006-2011, 1991. Hence, the inhibition of MIF results in the indirect inhibition of cytokines, growth factors, chemokines and lymphokines that the macrophage may otherwise bring to a site of inflammation. Human MIF cDNA has been isolated from a T-cell line, and encodes a protein having a molecular mass of about 12.4 kDa with 115 amino acid residues that form a homotrimer as the active form (Weiser et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:7522-7526, 1989). While MIF was originally observed in activated T-cells, it has now been reported in a variety of tissues including the liver, lung, eye lens, ovary, brain, heart, spleen, kidney, muscle, and others. See Takahashi et al., Microbiol Immunol. 43(1):61-67, 1999. Another characteristic of MIF is its lack of a traditional leader sequence (i.e., a leaderless protein) to direct classical secretion through the ER/Golgi pathway., 472283=[0243] 7a. mp 167-159\ufffd C.; 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) \u03b4 7.95 (dd, 1H), 7.70 (dt, 1H), 7.49 (d, 1H), 7.44 (d, 1H) 7.35 (m, 2H), 7.08 (m, 1H), 3.95 (bs, 4H), 3.75 (s, 3H), 3.3 (t, 4H); HRMS (FAB) calculated for C19H19O4N4S 399.1127, found 399.1117; Anal.

Such non-naturally occurring antibodies may be constructed using solid phase peptide synthesis, may be produced recombinantly, or may be obtained, for example, by screening combinatorial libraries including variable heavy chains and variable light chains (Huse et al., Science 246:1275-1281 (1989)). These and other methods of making, for example, chimeric, humanized, CDR-grafted, single chain, and bifunctional antibodies are well known in the art (Winter and Harris, Immunol. Today 14:243-246 (1993); Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546 (1989); Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York (1992); Borrabeck, Antibody Engineering, 2d ed., Oxford Univ. Press (1995); Hilyard et al., Protein Engineering: A practical approach, IRL Press (1992))., 495511=[0275] RP-HPLC was performed with a Hewlett-Packard Model HP-1100 unit using Symmetry Shield RP-8 (4.6\ufffd75 mm id, Waters, Milford, MA). The mobile phase was an isocratic solution of 35% Acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluroacetic acid. Absorbance was monitored at 235 nm. To measure the amount of test compound in serum, the sample serum proteins were first separated using 50% Acetonitrile (4\ufffd C. overnight) followed by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 30 minutes. The supernatant was then analyzed by the RP-HPLC and the compound concentration calculated based on a calibration curve of known standard. According to this procedure, reverse phase HPLC was employed to detect compound 7e in a linear range of 1.5-800 ng (R2=1) using spiked test samples (not shown). When the above analytical technique is applied to blood serum from animals receiving compound 7e (0.4 mg/20 gram mouse), circulating concentrations of compound 7e are quantitatively measured., 896752=[0341] To a suspension of 595-06 (600 mg, 1.5 mmol) in ethanol was added Pd/C (10%, 75 mg). The suspension was stirred under H2 atmoshphere at 60\ufffd C. for 4 h. The hot mixture was filtered through Celite and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness. The residue was recrystallised by ethanol to yield 490 mg (88%) of white solids.

After evolution of the gas ceased, the bromide (06-20) (1.0 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred until no traces of starting material could be detected (control by LCMS). A 10% solution of NH4Cl (20 ml) was added to the reaction and the resulting mixture was extracted with DCM. Compounds 1M1 and 1M2 were isolated and purified by preparative HPLC (C-18 silica column, 150 mm\ufffd41 mm, 40 ml/min, gradient: water-acetonitrile=from 60:40 to 5:95, 20 min). Compounds prepared according to this route are designated by the superscript \u201cA\u201d following the compound designation in Table 5., 476598=[0252] Monocyte migration inhibitory activities of recombinant murine and human wild-type and murine mutant MIF are analyzed by use of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or T-cell depleted mononuclear cells in a modified Boyden chamber format. Calcein AM-labeled monocytes are suspended at 2.5 to 5\ufffd106/mL in RPMI 1640 medium, with L-glutamine (without phenol red) and 0.1 mg/mL human serum albumin or bovine serum albumin. An aliquot (200 \u03bcL) of cell suspension is added to wells of a U-bottom 96-well culture plate (Costar, Cambridge, Mass.) prewarmed to 37\ufffd C. MIF in RPMI 1640 is added to the cell suspension to yield final concentrations of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/mL. The culture plate is placed into the chamber of a temperature-controlled plate reader, mixed for 30 s, and incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 10-20 min. During the incubation, 28 1L of prewarmed human monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1; Pepro Tech., Inc., Rocky Hill, N.J.) at 10 or 25 ng/mL or RPMI 1640 with 0.1 mg/mL HSA is added to the bottom well of a ChemoTX plate (Neuro Probe Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.; 3 mm well diameter, 5 \u03bcM filter pore size). The filter plate is carefully added to the base plate. Treated cell suspensions are removed from the incubator and 30 \u03bcL is added to each well of the filter plate. The assembled plate is incubated for 90 min. at 37\ufffd C. in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. Following incubation, the cell suspension is aspirated from the surface of the filter and the filter is subsequently removed from the base plate and washed three times by adding 50 \u03bcL of 1\ufffdHBSS\u2212 to each filter segment. Between washes, a squeegee (NeuroProbe) is employed to remove residual HBSS\u2212. The filter is air-dried and then read directly in the fluorescent plate reader, with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm. Chemotactic or random migration indices are defined as average filter-bound fluorescence for a given set of wells divided by average fluorescence of filters in wells containing neither MCP-1 nor MIF. Titration of fluorescently labeled cells revealed that levels of fluorescence detected in this assay have a linear relationship to cell number (not shown)., 478984=[0254] The tautomerization reaction is carried out essentially as described by Rosengren et al., Mol. Med. 2(1):143-149, 1996. D-dopachrome conversion to 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid is assessed. 1 ml sample cuvettes containing 0.42 mM substrate and 1.4 \u03bcg of MIF in a sample solution containing 0.1 mM EDTA and 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 are prepared and the rate of decrease in iminochrome absorbance is followed at 475 nm. L-dopachrome is employed as a control. In addition, the reaction products can be followed using an HPLC, utilizing a mobile phase including 20 mM KH2PO4 buffer (pH 4.0) and 15% methanol with a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Fluorimetric detection is followed at 295/345 nm., 488925=[0265] Raw 264.7 macrophage (3\ufffd106 cells per well) were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates (Costar) and cultured in RPMI/1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, Utah). After three hours of incubation at 37\ufffd C. in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2, nonadherent cells were removed and wells were washed twice with RPMI/1% FBS. Cells were then incubated for 24 hours with LPS (10:B4) or TSST-1 (Toxin Technology, Sarasota, Fla.), which were approximately 95% pure and resuspended in pyrogen-free water, at a concentration ranging from 1 pg/ml to 1000 ng/ml (for the dose response experiment). For time-course experiments, conditioned media of parallel cultures were removed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours intervals after stimulation with 1 ng/ml TSST-1 or LPS. For the inhibition studies, RAW 264.7 cells (3\ufffd106 cells per well) were incubated for 24 hours with 1 ng/ml of LPS (0111:B4) or 1 ng/ml of TSST-1 in the presence of 0.01 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM compound 7e or buffer (as control). The MIF in cell-conditioned media was concentrated on filters and the MIF remaining in the samples was analyzed by Western blotting and MIF band densities were also measured by Stratagene Eagle Eye\u2122., 414331=[0188] Determination of the presence of a complex that has formed between MIF and a binding agent and/or a candidate inhibitor may be performed by a variety of methods, as noted above, including fluorescence energy signal methodology as provided herein and as known in the art. Such methodologies may include, by way of illustration and not limitation FP, FRET, FQ, other fluorimetric assays, co-purification, co-precipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, radiometric, western immunoblot analyses, affinity capture including affinity techniques such as solid-phase ligand-counterligand sorbent techniques, affinity chromatography and surface affinity plasmon resonance, circular dichroism, and the like. For these and other useful affinity techniques, see, for example, Scopes, R. K., Protein Purification: Principles and Practice, 1987, Springer-Verlag, NY; Weir, D. M., Handbook of Experimental Immunology, 1986, Blackwell Scientific, Boston; and Hermanson, G. T. et al., Immobilized Affinity Ligand Techniques, 1992, Academic Press, Inc., California; which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties, for details regarding techniques for isolating and characterizing complexes, including affinity techniques. In various embodiments, MIF may interact with a binding agent and/or candidate inhibitor via specific binding if MIF binds the binding agent and/or candidate inhibitor with a Ka of greater than or equal to about 104 M\u22121, preferably of greater than or equal to about 105 M\u22121, more preferably of greater than or equal to about 106 M\u22121 and still more preferably of greater than or equal to about 107 M\u22121 to 1011 M\u22121. Affinities of binding partners can be readily calculated from data generated according to the fluorescence energy signal methodologies described above and using conventional data handling techniques, for example, those described by Scatchard et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 51:660 (1949)., 423948=[0199] One in vitro assay can be performed by examining the effect of a candidate compound on the ability of MIF to inhibit macrophage migration. Briefly, human peripheral blood monocytes are preferred as indicator cells in an agarose-droplet assay system essentially as described by Weiser et al., Cell. Immunol. 90:167-178, 1985 and Harrington et al., J. Immunol. 110:752-759, 1973. Other assay systems of analyzing macrophage migration may also be employed. Such an assay is described by Hermanowski-Vosatka et al., Biochem. 38:12841-12849, 1999., 248839=[0004] While MIF is also thought to act on cells through a specific receptor that in turn activates an intracellular cascade that includes erk phosphorylation and MAP kinase and upregulation of matrix metalloproteases, c-jun, c-fos, and IL-1 mRNA (see Onodera et al., J. Biol. Chem. 275:444-450, 2000), it also possesses endogenous enzyme activity as exemplified by its ability to tautomerize the appropriate substrates (e.g., dopachrome). Further, it remains unclear whether this enzymatic activity mediates the biological response to MIF and the activities of this protein in vitro and in vivo. While site directed mutagenesis of MIF has generated mutants which possess full intrinsic activity, yet fail to possess enzyme activity (Hermanowski-Vosatka et al., Biochemistry 38:12841-12849, 1999), Swope et al. have described a direct link between cytokine activity and the catalytic site for MIF (Swope et al., EMBO J. 17(13):3534-3541, 1998). Accordingly, it is unclear that strategies to identify inhibitors of MIF activity through inhibition of dopachrome tautomerase alone yields inhibitors of MIF activity of clinical value. The ability to evaluate the inhibition of MIF to its cell surface receptor is also limited since no high affinity receptor is currently known., 254343=[0010] The MIF inhibitors of preferred embodiments have utility over a wide range of therapeutic applications, and may be employed to treat a variety of disorders, illnesses, or pathological conditions including, but not limited to, a variety of immune related responses, tumor growth (e.g., prostate cancer, etc.), glomerulonephritis, inflammation, malarial anemia, septic shock, tumor associated angiogenesis, vitreoretinopathy, psoriasis, graft versus host disease (tissue rejection), atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, otitis media, Crohn's disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, delayed-type hypersensitivity, and others. See, e.g., Metz and Bucala (supra); Swope and Lolis, Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol 139:1-32, 1999; Waeber et al., Diabetes M. Res. Rev. 15(1):47-54, 1999; Nishihira, Int. J. Mol.

Today 3(11):502-507, 1997; Bucala et al., FASEB J. 10(14):1607-1613, 1996. Such methods include administering an effective amount of one or more inhibitors of MIF as provided by the preferred embodiments, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, to an animal in need thereof. Accordingly, in another embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions are provided containing one or more inhibitors of MIF of preferred embodiments in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent., 473258=[0245] 7c. mp 183-185\ufffd C.; 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) \u03b4 7.95 (dd, 1H), 7.61 (m, 1H), 7.48 (m, 1H), 7.38 (d, 1H) 7.32(m, 1H), 7.25 (M, 1H), 7.07 (M, 1H), 4.44 (q, 2H) 3.95 (bs, 4H), 3.70 (s, 3H) 3.35 (bs, 4H), 1.44 (t, 3H); HRMS (FAB) calculated for C22H24N3O4S, 426.1488 found 426.1487; Anal, Calculated for C22H23N3O4S: C, 62.10; H, 5.45; N, 9.88; 0, 15.04; S, 7.54 Found: C, 62.08; H, 5.45; N, 9.77., 446901=[0222] Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents are familiar to those skilled in the art. For compositions formulated as liquid solutions, acceptable carriers and/or diluents include saline and sterile water, and may optionally include antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and other common additives. The compositions can also be formulated as pills, capsules, granules, or tablets that contain, in addition to an inhibitor of MIF, diluents, dispersing and surface-active agents, binders, and lubricants. One skilled in this art may further formulate the inhibitor of MIF in an appropriate manner, and in accordance with accepted practices, such as those described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 1990., 395967=[0170] In one example, circular dichroism may be utilized to determine candidate inhibitor binding. Circular dichroism (CD) is based in part on the fact that most biological protein macromolecules are made up of asymmetric monomer units, L-amino acids, so that they all possess the attribute of optical activity. Additionally, rigid structures like DNA or an alpha helical polypeptide have optical properties that can be measured using the appropriate spectroscopic system. In fact, large changes in an easily measured spectroscopic parameter can provide selective means to identify conformational states and changes in conformational states under various circumstances, and sometimes to observe the perturbation of single groups in or attached to the macromolecule. Further, CD analysis has been frequently employed to probe the interactions of various macromolecules with small molecules and ligands. See Durand et al., Eur. Biophys. J. 27(2):147-151, 1998; Kleifeld et al., Biochem 39(26):7702-7711, 2000; Bianchi et al., Biochem 38(42):13844-13852, 1999; Sarver et al., Biochim Biophys Acta 1434(2):304-316, 1999., 246456=[0003] The lymphokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), has been identified as a mediator of the function of macrophages in host defense and its expression correlates with delayed hypersensitivity, immunoregulation, inflammation, and cellular immunity. See Metz and Bucala, Adv. Immunol. 66:197-223, 1997. Macrophage migration inhibitory factors (MIFs), which are between 12-13 kilodaltons (kDa) in size, have been identified in several mammalian and avian species; see, for example, Galat et al., Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc. 319:233-236, 1993; Wistow et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:1272-1275, 1993; Weiser et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:7522-7526, 1989; Bernhagen et al., Nature 365:756-759, 1993; Blocki et al., Protein Science 2:2095-2102, 1993; and Blocki et al., Nature 360:269-270, 1992. Although MIF was first characterized as being able to block macrophage migration, MIF also appears to effect macrophage adherence; induce macrophage to express interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha; up-regulate HLA-DR; increase nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide concentrations; and activate macrophage to kill Leishmania donovani tumor cells and inhibit Mycoplasma avium growth, by a mechanism different from that effected by interferon-gamma. In addition to its potential role as an immunoevasive molecule, MIF can act as an immunoadjuvant when given with bovine serum albumin or HIV gp120 in incomplete Freunds or liposomes, eliciting antigen induced proliferation comparable to that of complete Freunds. Also, MIF has been described as a glucocorticoid counter regulator and angiogenic factor. As one of the few proteins that is induced and not inhibited by glucocorticoids, it serves to attenuate the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids. As such, it is viewed as a powerful element that regulates the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids. Hence, when its activities/gene expression are overinduced by the administration of excess exogenous glucocorticoids (for example when clinical indicated to suppress inflammation, immunity and the like), there is significant toxicity because MIF itself exacerbates the inflammatory/immune response.

The candidate inhibitor and/or binding agent can be detectably labeled by covalently or non-covalently attaching a suitable reporter molecule or moiety, for example any of various fluorescent materials (e.g., a fluorophore) selected according to the particular fluorescence energy technique to be employed, as known in the art and based upon the methods described herein. Fluorescent reporter moieties and methods for as provided herein can be found, for example in Haugland (1996 Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals- Sixth Ed., Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.; 1999 Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals-Seventh Ed., Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., http://www.probes.com/lit/) and in references cited therein. Particularly preferred for use as such a fluorophore in preferred embodiments are fluorescein, rhodamine, Texas Red, AlexaFluor-594, AlexaFluor-488, Oregon Green, BODIPY-FL, and Cy-5. However, any suitable fluorophore may be employed, and in certain embodiments fluorophores other than those listed may be preferred., 479770=[0255] Alternatively, the tautomerization reaction utilizing phenylpyruvate or (p-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate is carried out essentially as described by Johnson et al., Biochem. 38:16024-16033, 1999. In this version, ketonization of phenylpyruvate is monitored at 288 nm (\u03b5=17300 M\u22121 cm\u22121) and the ketonization of (p-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate is monitored at 300 nm (\u03b5=21600 M-1 cm\u22121). The assay mixture contains 50 mM Na2HPO4 buffer (1 mL, pH 6.5) and an aliquot of a solution of MIF sufficiently dilute (0.5-1.0 \u03bcL of a 2.3 mg/mL solution, final concentration of 93-186 nM) to yield an initial liner rate. The assay is initiated by the addition of a small quantity (1-3.3 \u03bcL) of either phenylpyruvate or (p-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate from stock solutions made up in ethanol. The crystalline forms of phenylpyruvate and (p-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate exist exclusively as the enol isomers (Larsen et al., Acta Chem. Scand. B 28:92-96, 1974). The concentration of substrate may range from 10 to 150 M, with no significant inhibition of MIF activity by ethanol observed at less than 0.5% v/v., 474960=[0249] Macrophage migration is measured by using the agarose droplet assay and capillary method as described by Harrington and Stastny et al., J. Immunol. 110(3):752-759, 1973. Briefly, macrophage-containing samples are added to hematocrit tubes, 75 mm long with a 1.2 mm inner diameter. The tubes are heat sealed and centrifuged at 100\ufffdG for 3 minutes, cut at the cell-fluid interface and imbedded in a drop of silicone grease in Sykes-Moore culture chambers. The culture chambers contain either a control protein (BSA) or samples. Migration areas are determined after 24 and 48 hours of incubation at 37\ufffd C. by tracing a projected image of the macrophage fans and measuring the areas of the migration by planimetry., 405424=[0180] FP, a measurement of the average angular displacement (due to molecular rotational diffusion) of a fluorophore that occurs between its absorption of a photon from an energy source and its subsequent emission of a photon, depends on the extent and rate of rotational diffusion during the excited state of the fluorophore, on molecular size and shape, on solution viscosity and on solution temperature (Perrin, 1926 J. Phys. Rad. 1:390). When viscosity and temperature are held constant, FP is directly related to the apparent molecular volume or size of the fluorophore. The polarization value is a ratio of fluorescence intensities measured in distinct planes (e.g., vertical and horizontal) and is therefore a dimensionless quantity that is unaffected by the intensity of the fluorophore. Low molecular weight fluorophores, such as the detectably labeled candidate inhibitor and/or binding agent provided herein, are capable of rapid molecular rotation in solution (i.e., low anisotropy) and thus give rise to low fluorescence polarization readings. When complexed to a higher molecular weight molecule such as MIF as provided herein, however, the fluorophore moiety of the substrate associates with a complex that exhibits relatively slow molecular rotation in solution (i.e., high anisotropy), resulting in higher fluorescence polarization readings., 390623=[0165] Further, additional evidence in the art has indicated that steroids while potent inhibitors of cytokine production actually increase MIF expression. Yang et al., Mol. Med. 4(6):413-424, 1998; Mitchell et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274(25):18100-18106, 1999; Calandra and Bucala, Crit. Rev. Immunol. 17(1):77-88, 1997; Bucala, FASEB J. 10(14):1607-1613, 1996. Accordingly, it may be of particular utility to utilize MIF inhibitors in combination with steroidal therapy for the treatment of cytokine mediated pathophysiological conditions, such as inflammation, shock, and other cytokine-mediated pathological states, particularly in chronic inflammatory states such as rheumatoid arthritis. Such combination therapy may be beneficial even subsequent to the onset of pathogenic or other inflammatory responses. For example, in the clinical setting, the administration of steroids subsequent to the onset of septic shock symptoms has proven of little benefit. See Bone et al., N. Engl. J Med. 317: 653-658, 1987; Spring et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 311: 1137-1141, 1984. Combination steroids/MIF inhibition therapy may be employed to overcome this obstacle. Further, one of skill in the art may understand that such therapies may be tailored to inhibit MIF release and/or activity locally and/or systemically., 972970=[0392] Method A: To the suspension of NaH 0.03 g (0.8 mmol) in dry DMF (2 ml) was added compound 1M60 300 mg (0.7 mmol). After evolution of the gas ceased (\u02dc30 min) the solution of dimethylaminoethyl chloride (2.1 mmol) in ether was added. The reaction mixture was heated at 100\ufffd C. (ether was removed by distillation) for 12 h. The solution was cooled to room temperature and pH of the mixture was adjusted to pH 9 by 1% solution of AcOH in water. The mixture was extracted with DCM (3\ufffd3 ml) and combined DCM fractions were washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. DCM was removed on a rotary evaporator and the product was purified by prep TLC (AnalTech silica gel GF, 1000 gm, eluent: CHCl3: EtOH=4:1). Compound 1M64: yield 84 mg (24%), purity>99% (HPLC)., 436229=[0211] Other in vitro angiogenic assays include bioassays that measure proliferation of endothelial cells within collagen gel (Goto et al., Lab Invest. 69:508, 1993), co-culture of brain capillary endothelial cells on collagen gels separated by a chamber from cells exporting the MIF protein (Okamure et al., B.B.R.C. 186:1471, 1992; Abe et al., J. Clin. Invest. 92:54, 1993), or a cell migration assay (see Warren et al., J. Clin. Invest. 95:1789, 1995)., 442591=[0219] Given the various roles of MIF in pathology and homeostasis, inhibition of MIF activity or MIF extracellular localization may have a therapeutic effect. For example, recent studies have demonstrated that MIF is a mediator of endotoxemia, where anti-MIF antibodies fully protected mice from LPS-induced lethality. See Bernhagen et al., Nature 365:756-759, 1993; Calandra et al., J. Exp. Med. 179:1895-1902, 1994; Bernhagen et al., Trends Microbiol. 2:198-201, 1994. Further, anti-MIF antibodies have markedly increased survival in mice challenged with gram-positive bacteria that induces septic shock. Bernhagen et al., J. Mol. Med. 76:151-161, 1998. Other studies have demonstrated the role of MIF in tumor cell growth and that anti-sense inhibition of MIF leads to resistance to apoptotic stimuli. Takahashi et al., Mol. Med. 4:707-714, 1998; Takahashi et al., Microbiol. Immunol. 43(1):61-67, 1999. In addition, the finding that MIF is a counterregulator of glucocorticoid action indicates that methods of inhibiting MIF extracellular localization may allow for treatment of a variety of pathological conditions, including autoimmunity, inflammation, endotoxemia, and adult respiratory distress syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, otitis media, inflammatory joint disease and Crohn's disease. Bernhagen et al., J. Mol. Med. 76:151-161, 1998; Calandra et al., Nature 377:68-71, 1995; Donnelly et al., Nat. Med. 3:320-323, 1997. Because MIF is also recognized to be angiogenic, the inhibition of this cytokine may have anti-angiogenic activity and particular utility in angiogenic diseases that include, but are not limited to, cancer, diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, angiopathies, fertility, obesity and genetic diseases of glucocorticoid dysfunction like Cushings and Addisons disease., 385335=[0160] Mol. Med. 4(4):217-230, 1998. Further, it has been recently demonstrated that anti-MIF antibodies have a variety of uses, notably decreased tumor growth, along with an observed reduction in angiogenesis. Ogawa et al., Cytokine 12(4):309-314, 2000; Metz and Bucala (supra). Accordingly, small molecules that can inhibit MIF have significant value in the treatment of inflammatory responses, reduction of angiogenesis, viral infection, bacterial infection, treatment of cancer (specifically tumorigenesis and apoptosis), treatment of graft versus host disease and associated tissue rejection. A MIF inhibitor may be particularly useful in a variety of immune related responses, tumor growth, glomerulonephritis, inflammation, malarial anemia, septic shock, tumor associated angiogenesis, vitreoretinopathy, psoriasis, graft versus host disease (tissue rejection), atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory lung disorders, otitis media, Crohn's disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, delayed-type hypersensitivity. A MIF inhibitor may also be useful in the treatment of stress and glucocorticoid function disorders, e.g., counter regulation of glucocorticoid action; or overriding of glucocorticoid mediated suppression of arachidonate release (Cys-60 based catalytic MIF oxidoreductase activity or JABI/CSNS-MIF-interaction based mechanism)., 473810=[0246] 7d. mp 164-166\ufffd C.; 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) \u03b4 7.92 (dd, 11H), 7.60 (m, 1H), 7.44 (m, 5H), 7.37 (m, 1H), 7.27 (m, 1H), 4.45 (q, 2H), 3.65 (bs, 7H), 3.20 (bs, 4H), 1.45 (t, 3H); HRMS (FAB) calculated for C24H26NO3, 420.1923, found 420.1934; Anal.
