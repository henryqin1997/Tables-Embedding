This configuration allows you to comply with RFC 1195, which states that IP addresses are not required on each interface., 160011=In this case it could peak at approximately 2000 messages in the first second of the 100 second interval, but it would still be held to 40 messages per second average over the 100 second interval. In the second case it could handle a higher peak rate, but risk a longer period of time when no messages can be sent if it used up its quota for the interval., 3700=Sets up a single static translation. The local-ip argument establishes the local IP address assigned to a host on the inside network. The address could be randomly chosen, allocated from the RFC 1918, or obsolete.}",

Command Default Standard or extended IP access list number in the range from 1 to 199. access-list-number Syntax Description interest nhrp ip no access-list-number interest nhrp ip [access-list-number] To control which IP packets can trigger sending a Next Hop Resolution Protocol ( NHRP) request packet, use the ip nhrp interestcommand ininterface configuration mode. To restore the default value, use the no form of this command. ip nhrp interest ip nhrp holdtime 3600   In the following example, NHRP NBMA addresses are advertised as valid in positive authoritative NHRP responses",
    "textAfterTable": "Usage Guidelines Use this command with the access-list command to control which IP packets trigger NHRP requests. The ip nhrp interest command controls which packets cause NHRP address resolution to take place; the ip nhrp use command controls how readily the system attempts such address resolution. Examples In the following example, any TCP traffic can cause NHRP requests to be sent, but no other IP packets will cause NHRP requests:  ip nhrp interest 101 access-list 101 permit tcp any any Related Commands Command Description access-list (IP extended) Defines an extended IP access list. access-list (IP standard) Defines a standard IP access list.",
