Lamond is the undisputed master of this art form and she resurrects some real gems in this new CD. She carries the torch for a repertoire of songs that we can only hope won\u2019t go unloved by future generations. 3. Ashley MacIsaac: \u201cHi how are you today\u201d Incurably weird in some places (\u201cWhat An Idiot He Is\u201d) and crazy good in others (\u201cSleeping Maggie\u201d), this album won\u2019t be forgotten soon. By virtue of its creativity and MacIsaac\u2019s prodigious fiddling ability, it rises way above the rest of the bizarre fusion CDs that are constantly being dreamed up in the world of \u201cworld\u201d music. 4.
