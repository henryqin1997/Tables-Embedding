While it's impossible to get a definitive comparison between the WHA and NHL, I thought comparing their NHL numbers against other forwards the same age as them might help: vCash: 500 Posts: 5,541 Country: Join Date: Jan 2005 \u00a0 \u00a0 Registered User reckoning \u00a0 #8 08-26-2013, 08:36 AM",

But his PPG indicates that his offence wasn't very far behind that of his two comparables age-wise, Perreault and Sittler, both of whom will certainly make the top-60 list. Nilsson was primarily a passer, and his numbers likely suffered from not having a Bobby Hull on his line in New York (though that could also mean that Hull's presence helped inflate his WHA stats). I don't know if Fred Shero gave the Swedes the same offensive freedom that they had in Winnipeg. 1979-80 28 year-old forwards: Player GP G A Pts PPG Marcel Dionne 80 53 84 137 1.71 Guy Lafleur 74 50 75 125 1.69 Rick Martin 80 45 34 79 0.99 Robbie",
