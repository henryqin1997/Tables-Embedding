The \"values\" are all from the same ring, typically real or complex. Where orientation is important, such as for pre or post multiplication by a matrix a vector is treated as if it were a column vector and its transpose is treated a row vector. The type attribute can be used to explicitly specify that a vector is a \"row\" vector.
