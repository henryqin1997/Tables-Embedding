    "textAfterTable": "Directions: Greenfield High School Football Field, near the center of town, from the highway, one wants to turn to the east on Mulberry street. Past the first stop sign which is the junction of East and Mulberry streets. Then forward to the end of the block. Turn left just past the gymnasium. From there one can see the sign above the gates with the football field's name on it. The beginning of the sled riding hill overlooks the football field. Comments: When parking in the lot at the top of the hill, one can easily walk along the ridge toward the south from the steps that lead to the football field. So, if one chooses, they may walk up the hill after sledding down it or also walk over to the steps (roughly 8 terraces) to the top. The sled riding hill is fast enough to maintain adequate control and yet thrill a person. The only objects in the way would be a goal post, flag pole, and fence. All if these are not a problem as they are at the maximum distance a sled continues to travel and one approaches them usually while grinding to a halt. The sledding hill itself is for the most part smooth. There are no major bumps. Should one feel the need for more of an adrenaline rush, they can challenge the terraces that lead down directly",
