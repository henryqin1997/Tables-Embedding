            "Description",
            "The ABGPS, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and raw scans are collected during the LiDAR aerial survey. The ABGPS monitors the xyz position of the sensor and the IMU monitors the orientation. During the aerial survey, laser pulses reflected from features on the ground surface are detected by the receiver optics and collected by the data logger. GPS locations are based on data collected by receivers on the aircraft and base stations on the ground. The ground base stations are placed no more than 40 km radius from the flight survey area.",
            "Filtered and edited data are subjected to rigorous QA/QC, according to the 3001 Operating Unit Quality Control Plan and procedures. A series of quantitative and visual procedures are employed to validate the accuracy and consistency of the filtered and edited data. Ground control is established by Northrop Grumman, 3001 Operating Unit and GPS-derived ground control points (GCPs) in various areas of dominant and prescribed land cover. These points are coded according to land cover, surface material, and ground control suitability. A suitable number of points are selected for calculation of a statistically significant accuracy assessment, as per the requirements of the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy. A spatial proximity analysis is used to select edited LiDAR data points within a specified distance of the relevant GCPs. A search radius decision rule is applied with consideration of terrain complexity, cumulative error, and adequate sample size. Accuracy validation and evaluation is accomplished using proprietary software to apply relevant statistical routines for calculation of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA), according to Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) specifications.",
            "The ABGPS, IMU, and raw scans are integrated using proprietary software developed by Leica and delivered with the Leica System. The resultant file is in a LAS binary file format. The LAS version 1.2 file format can be easily transferred from one file format to another. It is a binary file format that maintains information specific to the LiDAR data (return number, intensity value, xyz, etc.). The resultant points are produced in the NAD83/2007 HARN State Plane Florida North Coordinate System, with units in U.S. Feet and referenced to the NAVD88 datum. The LiDAR mass points were processed in American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing LAS 1.2 format. The header file for each dataset is complete as defined by the LAS 1.2 specification. The datasets were divided into a 5000 ft by 5000 ft tiling scheme, based on the Florida state grid network. The tiles are contiguous, do not overlap, and are suitable for seamless topographic data mosaics that include no \"no data\" areas. The names of the tiles include numeric column and row designations and all files utilize the LAS file extension",
            "The unedited data are classified to facilitate the application of the appropriate feature extraction filters. A combination of proprietary filters are applied as appropriate for the production of bare earth digital elevation models (DEMs). Interactive editing methods are applied to those areas where it is inappropriate or impossible to use the feature extraction filters, based upon the design criteria and/or limitations of the relevant filters. These same feature extraction filters are used to produce elevation height surfaces.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received topographic files in LAS 1.2 format. The files contained lidar elevation measurements. The data were received in Florida State Plane North Zone 0903, NAD83 coordinates and were vertically referenced to NAVD88 using the Geoid09 model. The vertical units of the data were feet. CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The topographic las files were converted from orthometric (NAVD88) heights to ellipsoidal heights using Geoid09. 2. The topographic las files were converted from a Projected Coordinate System (FL SP North) to a Geographic Coordinate system (NAD83). 3. The topographic las files' vertical units were converted from feet to meters. 4. The topographic las files' horizontal units were converted from feet to decimal degrees. 5. Class 11 (Witheld) was changed to Class 13. 6. The data were converted to LAZ format.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
