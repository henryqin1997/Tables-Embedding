They were married at Cootehall, which would suggest that Catherine's family lived in the parish. Witnesses to their marriage were Michael Brother and Catherine Mulloy. Laurence and Catherine were my great-grandparents. They raised eight children, including my grandmother, Jane., 116478=The scope of my Callery ancestral research has, so far, been confined to information obtained from vital records relating to the parishes of Aughrim and Creeve. Other records searched included: 1659 Census of Ireland, 1749 Elphin Diocese Census, 1796 Spinning Wheel Survey of Ireland, Tithe Applotment Surveys of 1825, 1832 and 1842 and the Index of Householders, based on Griffith's Valuations [1848-64],, 127456=They had been together twelve years when Thomas[1] passed away in 1862. There is no record of his death, except that in 1862, ownership of his holding at 16b was transferred to his wife, Mary. We reckon that he would have been about age 82., 126500=James, the youngest son, inherited the family holding at Number 16c upon the death of his father in 1881. He married Anne Flynn, daughter of Patrick Flynn and Mary Morris of Grange, Fourmilehouse, on April 28, 1884. The marriage was performed by Fr. Michael O'Beirne, P.P. and witnessed by Thomas Beirne and Mary Morris, 113150=A news item in the local newspaper, March of 1898, tells of Laurence O'Hara, town councilor, having appeared at Boyle Petty Sessions charged with letting his dog wander the street unmuzzled. Have you anything to say Mr. O'Hara? asked the presiding court officer, Mr. Bull. \"I suppose not, sir. The dog wandered out after I fed him and I knew nothing about it until I got the summons from Constable Kelly.\" The judge wasn't impressed and he fined Laurence one shilling and court costs., 2740=A search of genealogical records confirms that my immediate Lavin ancestors have lived in the townland of Ardgallager, in the parish of Kilmore since the early 1800s and possibly earlier. Nearby, in the parish of Clooncraff my Callery ancestors were living in a townland more recently called Coolmeen, from at least 1825., 109971=Laurence was born in 1821; died in 1904 at the age of 83. He is described as having been a powerfully built man who showed off extraordinary feats of strength. When he was a young man in the early 1850s he volunteered his labor to help complete the Catholic church in Cootehall. This was just after the Great Famine that had devestated the countryside. The story repeatedly told over the years at family gatherings boasted of his strength carrying extremely heavy loads of masonry on his shoulders right to the top of the church tower they were building while tradesmen and onlookers stood in amazement at his capacity[28]., 92782=When Patrick and Jane married in 1869 a mere twenty years had passed since the Great Famine brought devastation to a large segment of Ireland's population. In 1841, the great majority of Irish families, living on farms of under seven acres, were existing at or below the poverty level. The significant decline in the population, caused by the Famine and subsequent emigration, brought a rapid change in farm sizes and agriculture methods. The size of farms increased rapidly from a mere seven percent with thirty acres or more in 1840 to more than thirty percent some forty years later., 7659=The second wave, known as the Euerni and later called Erainn (also known as Menapii, Bolgi, Belgae and Firbolgs) by annalists and historians, arrived after 500 BC. They called their new home Eueriio, which would later evolve through the old Irish Eriu to Eire, and from Eire to Ireland. Claudius Ptolemy's map of ancient Ireland shows branches of the Erainn widely dispersed throughout the island, but with strongest connection in the areas around Cork and Kerry where they first settled. These tribes, more frequently called the Firbolgs, were, according to historian J. Rhys (1890), a seafaring people who wore breeches, wielded improved weapons and traced their origins to the goddess Bolg. Norman Mongan, in his well-researched book, Menapia Quest (1995), traces their origin to the Menappi, a confederation of Belgae Celts from north Gaul and the area now known as Belgium. Among the several tribes he identifies, were the Dal Riada of west Antrim and the Dal Fiatach of east Ulster. Both of these tribes, he believes, were granted Gaelic ancestry and thereafter identified only as Gaodhail (the last of the ancient Celtic invaders). Mongon suggests that many Firbolgs survived into early historic times as \"tributary\" tribes. He also suggests that many of today's nameplaces in Ireland and elsewhere containing syllables such as mong, muin, maion, maine, managh, monach, manach, mannog, etc., attest to the presence of the Firbolgs in the area at some stage. Fr. Hanlon's edited version of the Life of St. Greallan, Patron of the Ui Maine, refers to the Firbolg people as the earliest noted aboriginal inhabitants of Connaught., 51482=The 1796 Spinning Wheel Survey contains a listing of 53,900 persons throughout Ireland who, in the year 1796, filed applications with the Linen and Hempen Manufacturers of Ireland for awards for growing hemp and flax that year. Only Counties Dublin and Wicklow are missing. Of the thirteen Lavins listed in this Survey, twelve are from County Roscommon, primarily from the Tibohine and Killucan areas (see Chart III)., 40440=Enter the eighteenth century and we find the Lavin surname has reappeared. Amazingly, it is still in MacDermot country although dispersed well beyond the boundaries of the original MacDermot Roe tuath. Records are hard to find on Irish Catholics in the eighteenth century. It should be remembered that during the previous century land belonging to the Catholic Gaelic chieftains had been confiscated and given to English Protestants who became the new landlords. The Registry of Deeds, established in 1708, required the registering of all land transactions, such as, conveyance, mortgages and leases. Marriage settlements and wills were also registered as if they were deeds. As deplorable as it seems, the purpose for establishing the Registry was to prevent land passing into Catholic ownership and, consequently, few Catholic landholders registered their deeds until the Penal Laws were relaxed in 1778. After this date Catholic landholders were more likely to register, especially if the agreement was between persons of equal economic standing. It was unlikely that the mass of small tenants would have bothered registering their deeds. Unfortunately, this policy severely impeded record keeping where Catholics were concerned, and it left a void as to their activities throughout most of the eighteenth century. Because of the policy, English surnames appear to a degree that is disproportionate to their minority status at the time., 103792=In 1786, a Laurence O'Hara of the townland of Behy in the parish of Tawnagh, made a will leaving his entire property to his daughter, Mary, who was the wife of John Brett. Tawnagh is in the ecclesiastical parish of Riverstown and, therefore, within the area of interest. This record merits specific attention, as it is the only confirmation of the name Laurence O'Hara having shown up in County Sligo records. The name Laurence was always popular with the Cootehall O'Haras., 32056=In 1526, Rory MacDermot's sons killed five or six O Conors in a retaliatory raid at Corrdrehid in Killukin parish. In 1526 and again in 1527 O Donnell forces invaded MacDermot territory and captured several castles. By the mid-sixteenth century Moylurg under Rory MacDermot had reached the peak of its power, holding sway from Athenry to the Sligo/Donegal border. Rory hired gallowglasses (mercenaries) from the Scottish Highlands to augment his military strength, paying them from the spoils he collected from the coffers of the vanquished tribes. As was noted earlier, among those who died in the service of Rory was a Donal Lavin who was killed in 1567 in a skirmish between Rory's forces and those of the sons of Eoghan MacDermot., 128926=Mac Lysaght,Edward. Irish Families, Their Names, Arms and Origins, Dublin 1937., 88125=Little has come down to us about Luke personal life. We have not determined where he was born. Nor do we yet know who his parents were. He may well have been born in Kilmore parish, but it's more than likely that he was born elsewhere, possibly in the parish of Killuken, near Carrick-on-Shannon. A Luke Lavin was living there in 1796. Were they related? The name association, if not a mere coincidence, suggests that the Killukin Luke may have been his grandfather. It was customary in Ireland in those days to name the first son after the paternal grandfather. Further, the parish of Killuken is in close proximity to the parish of Kilmore and it is quite possible that Luke or his father were born there and acquired the Ardgallagher property sometime in the late 1700s or early 1800s We also know that Luke's son, Patrick, had a Thomas Lavin as one of his baptismal sponsors. We are not sure if this Thomas Lavin was a brother of Luke's, but in all probability he would have been. There is a baptismal entry in Kilmore Church records for a Thomas Lavin in 1818, possibly the same person. His parents were given as Patrick Lavin and Margaret Ford. Could they have been Luke's parents? He did name his first son by his second marriage, Patrick. Was he following the traditional naming practice?, 104280=According to Tithe Applotment Books[20] entries, there were no O'Haras or Bretts registered for the townland of Behy [Tawnagh parish] in 1824. However, a Patt Brett, Esq. held seventy-two acres in the townland of Carrowkeel. It has not been ascertained if this Patt Brett was a son of Mary O'Hara and John Brett who received the Behy property from Mary's father, Laurence, in 1786. There were no entries made in the Tithe Applotment Books for O'Haras in the townland of Knockroe, parish of Kilmacallan in 1824 (where a Roger O'Hara was living in 1749). However, a Pat O'Hara resided on six acres in the townland of Rossangle and a Carmac O'Hara had eighteen acres in another townland. We don't know if they were descended from the 1749 Roger, or related to the Cootehall O'Haras. As a matter of interest, Carmac (or Cormac) is a name we have not found associated with the Cootehall O'Haras. The name Pat, of course, was very popular., 121982=Strokestown Parish, which included Kiltrustan, records two marriages of Callerys in the 1830s. Patrick Callery and Catherine Douane were married on January 8, 1835. Their sponsors were identified as Michael Douane and Elenor Naghtain. Also a Margaret Callery married a Thomas Wynn on November 11, 1837. In Elphin Parish the records there show a John Callery marrying a Lannan of Culleen on February 9, 1820., 94912=Patrick Lavin and Jane O'Hara raised twelve children -- six boys and six girls -- born between 1870 and 1892. All were still living when Patrick died in 1912. Eleven survived Jane. Only the youngest member, Cairan Patrick (Fr. Damian), predeceased her., 128157=Laing, Lloyd. Celtic Britain, New York, 1979, 87252=On the economic side, trade barriers between the two countries were removed and there was great expectation that increased British investment in Ireland would improve Irish living standards. However, the opposite was the reality. Irish industries, smaller in scale than their British counterparts and no longer protected by pre-Union tariffs, didn't have the economic resilience to survive the heavy competition from the neighboring island. Consequently, within a few short years Irish industries began a steady decline. There was further hardship from the economic slump which followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1814. Coupled with all of this was the greater demand in Britain for meat products, which set in motion a shift in Irish agriculture from tillage to grazing. The resulting effect was a significant increase in agricultural unemployment., 132990=The Books of Survey and Distribution. These contain abstracts of records dated from c. 1636-41 to 1701-03 compiling information pertaining to all landowners in Ireland, the description of their lands, the changes of ownership of each original estate or part thereof, and the rights or instruments of title within this period. Records are compiled parish by parish and barony by barony for all counties in Ireland. Two volumes of the Books of Survey and Distribution for the counties Roscommon and Mayo, edited by Robert C. Simington, were published by the Irish Manuscripts Commission [1949, 1956]. Because of the general lack of records for these two counties, these volumes supply useful records of land ownership in every parish and barony prior to and following the forfeitures of land under Cromwell and William III. Included are the names of the original owners before the confiscation, the description and extent of the lands consfiscated and to whom the forfeited land was allocated., 89437=Luke Lavin was married twice. His first marriage to a Joann Donlon took place about 1825. We have no information on Joann or the Donlon family. Baptismal records document three children by this marriage. The first child, John, was born in 1826. His baptismal record reveals that he was baptized on 15 May 1826 and Ardgallagher is given as his parents' address. This is the earliest record we have of Luke living in Ardgallagher. The Tithe Applotment Books covering the 1820s-30s period do not mention Luke or any Lavin occupying land in Ardgallagher at that time. The baptismal register shows that John's sponsors were Daniel Tighe and Mary Dowd. John evidently died in infancy because we find another child, born in June 1829, was also named John. His baptismal sponsors were John Galvin and Elizabeth Burns. The third listed in the baptismal register is Margaret. She was baptized on 9 September 1836 and her sponsors were Peter Oats and Eleanora Larkin. Luke's wife, Joann, seemingly died sometime between Margaret's birth in 1836 and 1839 when he remarried. There is no additional information on this family or their descendants, if there were any., 109041=Second O'Hara Generation:\u00a0\u00a0William O'Hara and Jane Boyde were my great-great-grandparents. William died in 1872 at age 75. Jane, believed to have been born in 1798, died in 1879. They raised five boys: Laurence (m. Catherine Mulloy), Robert (m. Delaney and Keavney), Roger (m. Elizabeth Lavin[24]), Andrew (m. Anne Mulloy[25]) and William (m. Jane Bambrick[26]). Laurence and Catherine were my great-grandparents. They are profiled under Third O'Hara Generation below., 90605=Luke's second wife, Brigid Stapleton, was a local Kilmore girl. According to information obtained from church records, Luke and Brigid were married in Dangan Roman Catholic Chapel, Parish of Kilmore, on August 11, 1839. Their marriage witnesses were Luke McGovern and Ann Deignan., 113658=Laurence was in the news again in March 1901 regarding a resolution he tabled at a commissioners' meeting objecting to the coronation oath of Edward VII who had just ascended the English royal seat following the death of Queen Victoria. The resolution read: \"Resolved that we, the Boyle Town Councilors, take this opportunity, at our first monthly meeting, to protest in the most emphatic manner against the oath administered to King Edward VII on the opening of Parliament, in which a gross insult has been offered, not only to the faithful Catholics of Eire, but to Catholicity the world over; and that we strongly urge Irish M.P.'s not to rest until they have such a disgraceful blot removed from the formalities in connection with the oath. Copies of his resolution will be forwarded to King Edward VII, Chief Secretary Mr. O'Kelly, M.P. and Mr. Tully, M.P.\", 128688=Lyndon, James Ireland in the Later Middle Ages, Dublin, 1973, 129639=Bartlett, Thomas. The O'Haras of Annaghmore c. 1600-1800., 32804=Following Rory's death in 1568, Moylurg power waned rapidly. His death marked a turning point for the worst for the MacDermots. His great rival, Turlough, became king. He would be the last ruler to carry the title, King of Moylurg. It was no easy reign for Turlough. Moylurg came under attack from O Rourke and Maguire who laid a path of destruction in their wake., 24827=The earliest reference to Lavin is in the sixteenth century where we find two mentions of the name in the Annals of Loch Ce10. The first recounts the killing of Domhnall O Laimhin (Donal Lavin) in a battle at Muninoghter near Boyle in 1551 between Jordan Boy MacCostello and the \"descendants\" of Muirchertach MacDermot Roe. MacCostello had marched on Moylurg in 1547 to seek return of property stolen by the MacDermots. In the resultant affray Rory's son, Brian, was wounded. According to the Annals of Connacht, this touched off a quarrel which lasted intermittently for ten to twelve years., 102108=A Roger O'Hara appeared in the Hearth Money Rolls of 1665. His address was given as Templehouse, Kilvarnet, County Sligo. Roger O'Hara is the name given to the father of Captain Patrick O'Hara killed in battle near the River Poe in Italy in 1702. A Roger O'Hara, with two children under fourteen and two over fourteen, was listed as a papist farmer in the townland of Knockroe, parish of Kilmacallan in the Elphin Diocesan Census of 1749[19]. Other O'Haras listed in this Census were James, a papist laborer living in the townland of Rosses in the same parish, and a Charles, a papist laborer with three children, living in the townland of Heapstown also in the same parish. These were the only O'Haras listed in the Elphin Census for the area (within the triangle) we suspect Laurence and Mary came from., 102948=We can't, of course, overlook the probability that Laurence's forebears may well have been living somewhere else in County Sligo during the eighteenth century. Roger of Knockroe appears to be a possible ancestral candidate on the basis of the name and address. Roger was a popular name with the Cootehall O'Haras, appearing with consecutive generations throughout the nineteenth century. James, on the other hand, was a rarely used name with the O'Haras, showing up once in 1860 and once again in 1874., 119999=The 1796 Spinning Wheel Survey conducted in 1796, shows flax-growing farmers who filed applications with the Linen and Hempen Manufacturers of Ireland for grants that year. The eight Callerys among those listed are shown below:, 129340=Scherman, Katherine, The Flowering of Ireland, Toronto. 1981, 136478=(Copyright 1997 by Garryowen, Inc., Publishers. All rights reserved.), 130639=Mattimoe, Cyril. North Roscommon -- its people and past, Boyle, 1992, 123279=In 1857, according to Griffith, there were four families residing on separately identified holdings in the townland of Coolmeen. Their names were Callery, Moran, Wynn and Dolan. Thomas Callery[1] shared 15 acres with six other unidentified persons. This holding was identified as Number 11. His son-in-law, Thomas Moran, was the occupier of Number 12a, which included a house, out-office and 15 acres and three roods. Thomas[1], his son Thomas[2] and son-in-law Thomas Moran also shared 53 acres with separate houses and out-offices identified as Numbers 16a, 16b and 16c. The lessor of these properties was Richard O'Farrell Caddle. James Wynn was identified as the occupier of holdings Number 12b containing one rood with house and out-office, and Number 15 containing 15 acres and one rood. Holdings Numbers 12d and 13 were occupied by Thomas Dolan. Mary Dolan occupied holdings Numbers 12c and 14. William Lloyd was the lessor of these properties., 37467=There is no mention of the surname Lavin in any relative seventeenth century document. The Annals of Lough Ce, the MacDermot's family chronicle, ended recording family events in 1590. As the sixteenth century faded into history, so did the barbaric warfare of the old Gaelic order. Elizabeth's regime had changed all of this by imposing English laws, admittedly at the point of a bayonet. But, the English, having defeated the old Gaelic order, couldn't resist the opportunity to claim the spoils -- good land, that is! And for the Irish the seventeenth century was one of more wars, confiscation's, forced transplantation and the like. In Roscommon, as elsewhere, Tudor English families were replacing many of the Gaelic families as the new elite. English law, requiring individual ownership of property in place of 'collective ownership' by the sept as was previously the case, was meeting compliance to avoid confiscation by the Crown., 107054=Roger was the second son. His birthdate is not known, but on the basis of collateral information it's believed to have been about 1800, He married a lady by the name of Maria Murry. They resided in the townland of Knockadaff where in 1834 they farmed ten acres, which had risen to seventeen by 1858. They had issue: Maria (m. Maxwell), Patrick (m. Meehan), Catherine (m. Tobin), Andrew, Anne and Roger (m. McGreevy)., 38419=In 1617 Brian MacDermot received the King James I Grant allocating him his ancestral lands of approximately 17,400 acres. Brian's principal lands were those of what later became Rockingham and Oakport estates, but he had large or small holdings in practically every parish in the newly created the barony of Boyle. MacDermot Roe received 3,000 acres and other MacDermots received 3,800 acres with the stipulation they pay ground rent to Brian. In Boyle barony only half of the freemen received Letters of Patent confirming title to their land. There were no Lavins among them. Were they then among the freeman who did not receive Letters of Patent confirming title to them? It's unlikely one will find the answer to this question without some future unexpected revelation., 137685=[23] Inscription on tombstone in Four-Mile-House church grounds reads Fr. Patrick O'Hara, P.P., Kilbride, died January 21, 1921, age 78., 103464=In 1779, an entry in the Convert Rolls, dated June 15th, reveals that a Roger O'Hara converted to Protestantism in the parish of Anchonry in County Sligo. This parish, while marginally outside the area from which it is believed Laurence and Mary originated, is none the less worth noting because of the name Roger., 130408=Hennessy, William M. The Annals of Loch Ce, 1014 - 1590, 2 Vols. 1939. Reproduction of the edition of 1871. The original manuscript copied in 1588 by a scribe named Philip Bradley for members of the MacDermot family., 70010=The MacCostellos were an Anglo-Norman family that established a foothold in the Costello-Gallen region in the twelfth century at the expense of the O Garas who were pushed eastward into Coolavin in County Sligo (before the MacDermots acquired it). Throughout much of the period, but particularly in the 1500s, the MacCostellos were frequently at war with the MacDermots Gall, their next door neighbors across the River Lung in Airtech. Between 1547 until 1559, Jordon Boy MacCostello and Rory MacDermot, King of Moylurg, were continually at war with each other. In one of the battles Domhnall O Lavin was among those killed in the service of MacDermot16. According to the Annals, the MacDermots and their allies went on a plundering trip to Clanmorris in Mayo in 1548. They killed the Abbot, Richard MacMorris, captured the castle of Castlekeel, put between one and two hundred men to death and came away with nearly a thousand head of cattle and ten horses. Other citations from the Annals tell of the death and destruction by the MacDermots and their hired mercenaries on the MacCostellos. But there is no reference in the Annals that the MacDermots ever ruled the Costello-Gallen territory, or that the MacCostello sept was at any time tributary to MacDermot. How then, and when, did the Lavins come to settle in Mac Costello country? Possibly it was due to normal expansion from a rising population in neighboring Airtech following the decline of the MacCostellos and MacDermots Gall. The merger of the two territories, following acquisition by the Dillons in the early 1600s, possibly opened up the boundary permitting unencumbered travel between the former tuaths., 132107=Tithe Applotment Books (1823-38): This record provides a detailed account, parish by parish, of land occupiers in each townland and includes the extent and value of their individual farms. Those in urban areas are not included. The Tithe Applotment Books for all of Ireland are on microfilm at the Genealogical Society. Indexes for these records are available at the National Library in Dublin., 122403=The Tithe Applotment Books of 1842, which compiled information on this area in the years 1834-35 showing occupiers of titheable land, has a Thomas Callery occupying a holding of three acres and two roods in the townland of Cregga in the parish of Kiltrustan. The land was leased to him by Lord Hartland of Park House, Strokestown. Also in 1842, a Patrick Callery and a Patrick Callery, Jr. were farming two small holdings at Lisagrogy, also in the parish of Kiltrustan, on land leased from Gilbert Conry of Cloonahee., 128456=Joyce, P.W. A Social History of Ancient Ireland, 2Vols., Kansas City 1997, 128216=Mongon, Norman, The Menappi Quest, Dublin. 1995, 10430=The last major Celtic settlement in Ireland took place about 150 BC They were the Gaodhail, or Milesians after their leader, Milish or Mil, who, according to tradition, fled Roman incursions into the Iberian Peninsula The ancient manuscript, Leabar Gabala, has them landing at two locations -- Kerry in the south and the Boyne estuary in the east. Those who landed through the Boyle estuary pushed the earlier Laginian settlers from their land in north Leinster and established their kingship at Tara. The southern Gaodhail invaders had no fixed location at the beginning, instead they pushed inland moving from one district to another until eventually they made Cashel their headquarters., 128763=MacManus, Seamus The Story of the Irish Race, New york, 1972, 9316=The third colonization is believed to have taken place sometime about 300 B.C. These trailblazers, called the Laginians, and mythologically referred to as the Tuatha De Danann, are believed to have come from the northwestern region of Gaul, later Normandy. Their name association with Laighi, the ancient name for Leinster, suggests that this was where they first settled. Eventually, they extended their power to Connacht, and in the process forced the Firbolg tribes into the remoter parts of the province. The remains of many great stone forts built by the Firbolgs in their defense against the Laigain tribes can still be seen in remote areas of western Ireland. Within a few generations the Laigain tribes had established themselves in Connacht, where in County Sligo their descendants include the O'Haras, O'Garas, and others. Their strength, nonetheless, was uppermost in southeastern Leinster where they remained the dominant power into historic times. In Munster and in Ulster they made little impact, suggesting that their conquest was limited to parts of present-day Leinster and Connacht., 110608=Catherine was born in 1821. We don't have the year of her death, but according to the 1901 Census, she was still living. We have not researched Catherine's family history and therefore have little knowledge of their origin. Cyril Mattimoe, author of North Roscommon---its people and past, claims that all the Cootehall Mulloys, including his maternal ancestors, were kinsfolk of the prominent Mulloy family of Oakport. The Mulloys, thrown off their extensive land holdings in County Offaly after the the Cromwellian Wars, settled in north Roscommon sometime in the 1650s. Laurence and Catherine raised eight children, two daughters and six sons. One of the daughters, Jane that is, was my grandmother. Names of their children were: Mary (m. King), Jane (m. Lavin), Patrick (m. Mulleany), William, John, Charles (m. Duffey), Laurence (m. O'Leary) and Joseph (m. Mulloy), 129020=O'Donovan, John ed. Annals Of The Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters from the Earliest Period to the Year 1616. (7 vols.) Dublin, 1854., 106812=William was born in 1797 and since his mother, Mary, was then nineteen it is conceivable that he was their first child. William married Jane Boyde, also from the Cootehall area. William and Jane were my great-great-grandparents., 26574=The history of the MacDermots began in Moylurg in the immediate vicinity of Loch Ce to the east of present day town of Boyle in the tenth century. They descended from the powerful Ui Briuin Ali dynasty through a branch popularly known as Sil Murray after its foremost ancestor, Muiredach Mullethan, King of Connacht (697-702). After the death of Tadhg of the Towers who reigned as Sil Murray king of Connacht (924-956), the kingship and much of the territory passed to his son, Conor (the eponymous ancestor of the O'Conors). Another son, Mulrooney, was given or acquired the territory of Moylurg and there founded an independent tuath in 956, which became known after him as O Mulrooney. The Clan Mulrooney later adopted the name Clan MacDermot following the emergence of Dermot, who reigned as King of Moylurg from 1124 to 1159., 130136=O'Donovan, John.

Kansas City, 1993, 42123=The Elphin Diocese Census was undertaken in 1749 by Bishop Edward Synge of the Church of Ireland. This Survey, limited to householders in the diocese of Elphin, covers most of County Roscommon and the eastern third of County Sligo. It does not cover the districts in Mayo and western Sligo where Lavins are living a century later, because they are in another diocese. Charts I and II below show the Lavin population distribution in Counties Roscommon and Sligo (southeastern region only)., 35080=Failure to enact the Compossicion did not dampen the Crown's efforts to push for the English legal and administrative system throughout Connacht. Crown efforts to extend control over non-compliance areas moved ahead and Connacht was thrust into another cycle of warfare. At the end of the sixteenth century it was particularly chaotic. Disunity among the Connaught chieftains was hastening the break-up of the Gaelic aristocracy. Political and social upheaval followed defeat of Irish and Spanish forces at the Battle of Kinsale in 1602. There were a few isolated holdouts after Kinsale. The MacDermots fought their last successful Battle of the Curlieus against Crown forces under Lord Dunkillin. For them also the handwriting was on the wall and they finally surrendered in 1604. The Crown tightened its control over Moylurg by building a stronghold at Tintagh between Lough Arrow and Lough Key. Religious institutions were confiscated and decrees of banishment were issued against Catholic clergy. After Kinsale considerable tracts of land were confiscated in Ulster and planted with Scottish and English settlers. The threat of land confiscation caused unrest everywhere. Moylurg was no exception. Sir John King established a foothold there and in 1607 built a castle at Boyle. Throughout the province of Connacht, the distinctive Gaelic aristocratic old guard was now more or less coming to an end., 91710=Luke Lavin and Brigid Stapleton had three children that we know of. A daughter, Ann, was born in 1840. Her baptismal sponsors were listed as Daniel Hanly and Margaret Stapleton. Another daughter, Elizabeth, married Roderick [Roger] O'Hara in Kilmore Chapel on June 29, 1868. Roger, age 43 at the time, was the son of William O'Hara and Jane Boyde of Cootehall. Son Patrick was born on March 13, 1843. His baptismal sponsors were Thomas Lavin and Elizabeth Stapleton. He married Jane O'Hara on June 14, 1869. Jane was niece to Roger who married Patrick's sister, Elizabeth., 129258=Otway-Ruthven, A. J., A History of Medieval Ireland, New York. 1980, 39205=The Lavin name does not appear in the Books of Survey and Distribution[15] a record showing transfer of property ownership in the mid-sixteenth century. This Survey began in County Roscommon in 1635 and took place over the next few years. It shows the land ownership in parishes and baronies prior to and following the forfeitures of land under Cromwell and King William, and includes the names of the original owners before confiscation, the description and extent of the lands confiscated and to whom the forfeited land was allocated. There was great anxiety and unrest everywhere as great tracts of land passed into the possession of foreign adventurers and transplants from other provinces. Cromwell's command, 'To hell or to Connacht' was the password of the time., 33182=About the same time the English government began to take a greater interest in the affairs of Connacht, attempting to restore law and order in the province. Roscommon and the rest of Connacht were shired in 1575, sheriffs were appointed and provision made for law courts. But in reality the state of affairs was unchanged. Another attempt at change came in 1585 when Sir John Perrott presented the Compossicion of Connacht., 131237=Falley, Margaret Dickson, Irish and Scotch-Irish Ancestral Research. Baltimore, 1984. Grenham, John, Tracing Your Irish Ancestors, the Complete Guide. Baltimore, 1992. Ryan, James G., Irish Church Records. Dublin, 1992, 134982=In 1796, a survey referred to as the Spinning Wheel Survey of Ireland was conducted. It contains a listing of 53,900 persons from 30 counties who, in the year 1796, filed applications with the Linen and Hempen Manufacturers of Ireland for awards for growing hemp and flax that year. Only Counties Dublin and Wicklow are missing., 25443=The second Lavin account was that of Maghnus mc Cormac mc Domhnall Mael O Laimhin who was killed in 1567 by the sons of Eoghan MacDermot in treachery \"on the Mollog.\" Maghnus, possibly a grandson to Domhnall who was killed in 1551, is described as a servant to Rory MacDermot, king of Moylurg (1549 to 1568). According to the Annals of Loch Ce, Mangus lost his life in one of the many unrelenting MacDermot tribal clashes which started when Rory's son, Brian, attacked the monastery at Boyle then in the possession of Eoghan MacDermot's sons, one of which was abbot of the monastery at the time. Later Eoghan's sons returned and burned the place down and in the melee, Eoghan MacDermot's son, Tadhg, killed Rory's eldest son, Mulrooney., 125923=Thomas[2] married Bess Ford in or around 1840. It has not been determined where Bess was from. After their marriage, the couple lived in Cartron Bawn at Holding 16c next to 16b where Thomas[1] and his second wife, Mary had their home.. Thomas[2] died at Cartron Bawn on July 17, 1880. He was age 75 at the time. Ownership of his holding at 16c was transferred to his youngest son, James, in 1881. There were eight children (four boys and four girls) born to Thomas and Bess. They named them Thomas[3], Patrick, Michael, Catherine, Maria, Liza, Margaret and James., 135325=Census of 1901, 108630=Laurence, Jr. was born in 1815. He married Ellen Meehan. They farmed in Cleigna, Derrygirraun and Cloongreaghan. Their children were: William, Patrick, Ellen (m. Patrick Mulleany of Kilmactrany in 1867), John, Margaret, Bridget, Laurence, Elizabeth and Charles. Laurence, Jr. died in 1885. According to the 1901 Census, his widow Ellen, age 82, was still living in Cleigna with her son, Laurence., 71976=In County Sligo (see Chart VI) the Lavins were most frequently listed for Corran and Tirerrill, contiguous baronies north of the barony of Boyle in County Roscommon. This too was MacDermot territory before it passed into the hands of the MacDonaghs in the fourteenth century. According to the Four Masters, the MacDonagh sept took its patronymic from a Donaugh who descended from Tomaltach MacDermot, King of Moylurg (1197-1207). The MacDonaghs remained tributary to the MacDermots well into the fifteenth century. About 1446 the MacDonaghs agreed to divide their territory into Tirrerill and Corran and elect a MacDonagh chief over each. It has been said that the MacDonaghs were a predatory sept, always at war with their neighbors and when they couldn't find neighbors to fight with they fought among themselves. Did the Lavins settle in south Sligo when the MacDermots first moved into the region, or was it at a later date when it came under the rulership of the MacDonaghs? Because of the scarcity of reference to the Lavin sept, one can only venture a guess at the answer., 106316=Laurence O'Hara and Mary McDonough[21] raised four sons -- William, Roger, Patrick and Laurence, Jr. There may have been other children that did not survive. For instance, Patrick was born in 1808 and the next birth, that of Laurence, wasn't until 1815 suggests that a birth or two may have occurred in the interim years. It was not unusual to encounter one or more infant deaths in a family in those times. There were no daughters, at least none were recorded., 131482=Griffith's Valuation (1848-68). Undertaken to determine the amount of tax that each person should pay to support the upkeep of the poor. Arranged by Poor Law Union, the Survey lists all occupiers or tenants, and the immediate lessors of all lands, buildings, etc. In some areas, these valuations start in 1839; but the majority exist from 1848-64. Such information as the name of tenants, lessor, townland, parish, and tax will be found on these records. An index by surname by parish and county is available at the National Library of Ireland in Dublin. Also, available at the LDS Genealogical Society, 105542=In the parish of Killadoon in 1834 we find two O'Hara entries. Charles O'Hara was farming thirteen acres and John O'Hara had eight acres in the townland of Coolemoneen. In this same parish there were ten McDonough families with holdings between four and twenty-seven acres. There is a strong probability that Laurence's wife, Mary, was from this area, because of the similarity in the name spelling, which differed from that in other Sligo parishes., 116898=Edward MacLysaght[33] tells us that the name Callery is synonymous with the names Colleary, and its variants Collary and Colary, and is almost exclusively found in Connacht. MacCallery was among the landholders of County Sligo in 1633, and the name appears four times a century earlier in the Fiants, always in County Sligo. According to MacLysaght, the name is generally confined to counties Sligo and Mayo. where Irish speakers use \"Mac Giolla Laoire\" as the Gaelic form. Callery and Callary also are found in Meath and Cavan., 130722=MacDermot, Sir Dermot. MacDermot of Moylurg, Dublin. 1996, 128544=Lecky, W.E.H. A History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century [Abridged and with an Introduction by L.P. Curtis, Jr.] Chicago 1972, 55142=There are two significant documents from the nineteenth century, the first being The Tithe Applotment Books, compiled between 1823 and 1838 in preparation for the Tithe tax. Included in this survey, were the occupiers of titheable land; omitted were cottiers, laborers, other trades and urban dwellers. The second, An Index of Householders based on Sir Richard Griffith's Primary Valuations of 1848 through 1864 (hereinafter referred to as Griffith), lists every householder and occupier of land except for Dublin City. Griffith gives no personal particulars other than the name, townland address, acreage held and the estimated value of the holding, and from whom the land was leased. The information obtained from those documents, particularly Griffith, gives more conformation on the locales of the Lavin sept at the time., 135354=Census of 1911, 130976=Simmington, Robert C. The Transplantation of Connacht (1654-58), Dublin. 1970, 40009=The Lavin sept might as well have ceased to exist in the seventeenth century as far as reference to it is concerned. Possibly, its population had been decimated after the barbarous internecine warfare of the previous century. According to the 1659 Census, Ireland's population was estimated at between 500,000 and one million Constant warfare and slaughter, no doubt, had taken its toll on lives and property., 134481=In 1749 Edward Synge, Church of Ireland Bishop of Elphin, had a census of his diocese taken. This covered most of Co. Roscommon, the eastern region of of County Sligo and nine parishes in County Galway. Arranged by parish and townland, the data collected listed the householder, his occupation, his spouse, their children under and over the ages of fourteen and their religion. Also listed, the number, sex and religion of their servants. All religions and economic classes are covered., 107484=Patrick, the third son, was born in 1808. He married Honoria Lavan. We have not researched Honoria's family history and have no idea as to which Lavins she belonged. When she died in 1896 her age was listed as 86, confirming she was born in 1810. Patrick farmed in Cleigna. In 1833 his farm consisted of four acres; by 1858 the acreage had risen to fifty-five. Patrick was nicknamed \"The Colonel.\" The story[22] goes that when he and his brother, Laurence, were young lads they had a quarrel. To resolve the matter, their father arranged a boxing contest between them which Patrick, upon trouncing his little brother, was supposedly told by his father 'You're the Colonel now me boy' and the nickname stuck. Patrick and Honoria reared six children: Patrick (who became a priest and was parish priest of Kilbride Parish when he died in 1921 at age 78[23]), Roger (m. Hunt), Mary (m. Simon), Anne (m. Murphy and McDermott), Michael (m. Hogg) and Bridget.. Patrick died in 1886. Honoria lived another ten years; she died in 1896 Their grave is located outside the O'Hara family plot in Ardcarne cemetery., 137263=[15] Survey and Distribution (1635-1641). Vol. I prepared by Robert C. Simington, 128838=Moody, T.W and Martin, F.X., eds. The Course of Irish History, Cork, 1967, 130283=O'Donovan, John. Tribes and Customs of Hy-Many (O'Kelly's Country) Dublin, 1843; sp. ed. pub. Kansas City 1992, 92299=Patrick Lavin, my grandfather, inherited the Ardgallagher family farm from his father, Luke, sometime prior to 1869. It's not clear if this happened upon the death of his father, Luke, or not. He was 26 years old when he married Jane O'Hara on June 14, 1869. Jane was 21 then. They were married in Cootehall Church. The witnesses at their marriage were Richard Duignan of Kilmore and Brigid Healy of Kilronan. Patrick died in 1912 at the age of 69. Jane died in 1922., 111491=Son, Laurence, was a prominent citizen of Boyle in the late 1800s. In 1888, he was one of three new commissioners elected to the Boyle Town Commission. A search of archived copies of local newspapers from 1888 to 1903 in the London Newspaper Library[29] found many references to Laurence's civic activities, and some rare glimpses of Laurence the public figure., 117472=For several generations my Callery ancestors lived in Coolmeen, a townland in the Parish of Clooncraft in County Roscommon. When exactly they settled in Clooncraff, or from where they migrated, has not been determined. Our best guess is that they descended from the Callerys who were living in the adjoining parish of Aughrim in 1749. In 1749, a James Callery, his wife, Margaret, and their not yet fourteen year old son were living in Carrowagleragh, a townland in the parish of Aughrim. This we know from a census of all religions and economic classes undertaken that year by Bishop Edward Synge of Elphin. Aughrim, an ecclesiastical parish in the Diocese of Elphin, was comprised of three civil parishes -- Aughrim, Kilmore and Clooncraff -- each embracing several townlands, one of which was Carrowagleragh. The information collected through the census was limited, consisting of the household occupier, his spouse, the number and ages of their children under and over fourteen and their religion. Families identifying themselves as Roman Catholic were recorded as 'papists.', 125606=Daughter, Mary, married Thomas Moran sometime before 1825. Thomas Moran occupied an adjoining holding identified as number 12a. We have no record as to when Mary was born or when she died. Thomas Moran died in or about 1873, since in that year title to number 12a holding passed on to his son, Patrick., 93384=The Griffith Survey shows that Patrick's father, Luke, was farming 51 acres in the contiguous townlands of Ardgallagher and Scrabbagh ten years earlier in 1857. He is listed as having 17 acres at No. 2a Ardgallagher and 34 acres at No. 7 Scrabbagh. Fulke Greville was the lessor of the property and its valuation was listed at L28.5. In 1869, a feudal relationship still prevailed in Ireland with ownership of land in the hands of only three per cent of the population, mostly absentee landlords living abroad. Patrick belonged to the ninety-seven percent of Irish farmers who were simple tenants on the lands. There was alot of agitation about land ownership at the time with demands for transfer of ownership to tenants dominating the political agenda. The Deasy Act of 1860 had converted fuedal relations into a contractual agreement in an effort to provide some protection for tenants. This was followed by the Gladstone Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act [1870] which theoretically gave tenants security of tenure, but in actual practice changed nothing, since the landlords were still a power to be reckoned with and would not forfeit their rights so easily. Subsequent legislation would be required to deal effectively with the landlord class and it came about in a series of later measures which allocated funds making the transfer of land from landlord to tenant a reality. Much of the 51 acres that Patrick inherited from his father was good land capable of producing arable crops and grazing livestock., 96419=By 1833, the O'Haras were well established in the Cootehall area where Laurence and his sons were farming in the townlands of Cleigna, Knockadaff and Glooria. One theory would be that Laurence and Mary arrived in the area sometime between 1820 and 1833 and were sufficiently well-off to acquire land almost immediately. Folk memory has it that Laurence was a hatter. If in fact he was, one could speculate that he and Mary arrived at a much earlier date, possibly soon after their marriage in 1796, and were in the hat-making business until his family was raised and/or his resources were sufficient to secure himself some farm land., 95588=The Cootehall O'Haras were traced back to Jane's great-grandparents, Laurence O'Hara and Mary McDonough, who were born in County Sligo in the latter half of the eighteenth century. Mary would have been born in 1778, since it is believed she was sixty-one when she died in 1839. Laurence's birth date has not been determined, but more than likely he was born some time before Mary in the 1770s. We do not know from which area in County Sligo they came or when precisely they arrived in Cootehall. According to maps prepared around 1820-1825, there is mention of only one O'Hara living in Cootehall at the time. She was known as the Widow O'Hara who farmed a few acres in the townland of Moigh. Widow O'Hara, however, was not Mary McDonough, as Mary had died before Laurence and, therefore, could not have been a widow., 41893=There are at two surviving Surveys listing the surname Lavin in eighteenth century Ireland. They are the 1749 Elphin Diocese Census of all Religious and Economic Classes and the 1796 Spinning Wheel Survey of Ireland., 28963=The MacDermots also acquired a territory called Clann-Cuainn in the barony of Carra in County Mayo in the middle of the twelfth century. It had belonged to the O Quins, tributaries of the O Dowds who were lords at the time of the country between Ballinrobe and Sligo. As the story is told by MacFibis of Lecan[11], Rory O Dowd, head of his sept, raped the beautiful daughter of Domhnall O Quin. O Quin slew O Dowd and then ran to MacDermot of Moylurg for protection in exchange for his patrimonial. In 1230 the MacDermots lost the territory to the Stauntons, a Norman family under the de Burgos., 124244=As the 19th Century moved on we find the Clooncraff Callerys making significant expansion to their holdings. In 1825 they had owned 25 acres; by 1858 they had 93 acres. They acquired an additional holding in the townland of Clooncatten where in 1858 Thomas Callery is identified as the occupier of Holding Number 1a containing 27 acres and one rood with a herd's house. It has not been determined which Thomas owned this property but we know that it passed on to Thomas's[2] son, Patrick, a few years later., 128102=Herm, Gerhard, The Celts, New York, 1975, 132516=School Records (1850-1920). These are primarily records of public schools and include names of pupils, ages, religion, days absent or present, occupation of parents, residence of family, and the name of the school. Sometime the name of the county and school last attended may be given or the cause of withdrawal and destination of the pupil. Most of these records are indexed and are at the Public Record Office in Dublin or the Genealogical Office in Dublin., 131068=Weld, Isaac, Statistical Survey of the County Roscommon, Dublin. 1832, 114551=Obviously, there was something in the wording of the oath that was offensive to the King's Catholic subjects and Laurence wanted the King to know it. The resolution was passed with one dissenting vote objecting on the grounds that religious matters had no place on the council agenda. The last reference to Laurence as town councilor was on March 7, 1903. It was in reference to a proposal he made to appoint a council committee to confer with the Board of Works on a \"new works\" urgently needed in Boyle., 7198=The Priteni tribes, after whom Ireland and Britain were known to the early Greeks as the Pritenic Islands, are believed to have arrived sometime after 600 BC. In Ireland their descendants became the Cruitin tribes later living alongside the powerful Dal Riada tribes (Belgae people) who dominated northeastern Ulster up to the ninth century AD. The Romans referred to them as the Picti, probably because of their incursions into Pictish Caledonia., 130794=Simmington, Robert C., Books of Survey and Distribution (vol. 1 County of Roscommon), Dublin. 1949, 115525=I have not mentioned Paddy O'Hara or, as he was generally known, \"Paddy from Cootehall,\" since I have not been able to link him with a specific branch of the family. Paddy was a noted Raparee[32] who operated around Cootehall in Fenian times. He was arrested and jailed following a raid for arms on the Hill of Leitrim. He died from typhus in Roscommon Jail in 1862., 122934=In the parish of Clooncraff, the Tithe Applotment Books of 1842 record a Thomas Callery, his son Thomas, Jr. and son-in-law Thomas Moran then farming a holding of 25 acres in the townland of Cartron Bawn. He is also shown with one acre and one rood in Kildrum as well. Cartron Bawn and Kildrum would later become known as Coolmeen., 129711=McKenna, Lambert. ed. The Book of O'Hara [Leabhar I Eadhra], Dublin, 1980, 129174=O'Rahilly, Thomas F,, Early Irish History and Mythology, Dublin. 1946, 116022=My maternal ancestors were Callerys. My mother's name was Winifred Agnes Callery before she married my father, Francis Xavior Lavin in 1928. She was the second youngest of eight children born in 1899 to James Callery and Anne Flynn of Coolmeen, now a townland in the half-parish of Creeve, which at an earlier time was in the parish of Clooncraft. Her family had lived there for several generations all the way back to her great-grandfather., 90901=Brigid Stapleton had three sisters -- Margaret, Elizabeth and Ann. -- all of whom married local suitors. Margaret married a man by the name of Healy and Elizabeth married into the Glancy family. Ann married a Bernard Duignan at Dangan Chapel on August 14, 1833. Witnesses to their marriage were Peter Cox and Mary Regan. Seventeen years earlier in 1816, a Mary Stapleton married a John Dignan in Kilmore Chapel. They had six children and, interestingly, one was called Bernard. Bernard, according to church records, was baptized on June 6, 1822 which counts him out as Ann's husband. Ann probably was Mary's niece. A son of Ann's, William Duignan, married Brigid Healy at Kilmore Chapel on February 19, 1870. Brigid Healy was the daughter of Michael Healy and Winifred Beirne of Feeragh Mahon., 28366=To the north of Moylurg a region, which later became the baronies of Tirerrill and Corran in County Sligo, was also part of MacDermot's domain. The MacDonaghs, an offshoot of the MacDermots, later became its rulers. The Annals of the Four Masters record that the MacDonaghs took their patronymic name from Donough, son of Tomaltach MacDermot, who was king of Moylurg 1197-1207. The MacDonaghs too produced their own chieftains while remaining an integral part of the Moylurg kingdom. They later split into two septs, the MacDonaghs of Tirerrill (Collooney) and of Corran (Ballymote)., 124766=Callerys were occupiers of land in the townland of Cartron Bawn in the parish of Clooncraft for at least five generations. My great-great-grandfather, Thomas[1] Callery, was, as far as I can tell, the first of the family line to arrive there. He was born about 1780, assuming he would have been 25 when his eldest son, Thomas[2], was born in or about 1805. The earliest record we find of Thomas[1] comes from the Tithe Applotment Books of 1842, which show him, his son Thomas[2]. and son-in-law Thomas Moran then farming a holding of 25 acres in Cartron Bawn. Thomas[1] married his first wife, Brigid Lally, about 1800. There were two children that we know of by this marriage -- Thomas[2] and Mary. Brigid Lally died sometime before 1850. We could not find a record of her death but we know that Thomas[1] remarried in 1850.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Chart I Among the families of lesser status inhabiting the rugged terrain of north Roscommon since the sixteenth century is a sept with the surname Lavin. Before that time we can find no confirmation of its existence in Ireland. We now know that a community of Lavins inhabited the province of Cantabria in northern Spain from a much earlier date. They too are Celts and are a typical surname from an ethnological group of Cantabrians known as Pasiegos living in the valleys along the Pas River. We find that in some instances they have similar social and economic characteristics to those of the Irish Lavins, such as confining themselves to nucleic communities with an unwillingness to venture beyond their territorial boundaries. Another similarity is that both groups are traditionally cattle farmers. Edward MacLysaght (More Irish Families, 1960), describes Lavin as a sept located in MacDermot country in north Roscommon. He observes that the name ranks prominently as one found among the \"Followers of MacDermot Roe,\" ruler of Tir Tuathail a territory in the northeastern part of the county. MacLysaght gives little details, except to say that the name has been occasionally anglicized to Hand, and points out that there is no correlation with the surname MacLavin, an entirely different family believed to be of the Mullavin sept found in County Westmeath. William and Mary Durning (A Guide to Irish Roots) inform us that the name Lavin originates from O'Flaithim or O'Lamhain, a surname found",
