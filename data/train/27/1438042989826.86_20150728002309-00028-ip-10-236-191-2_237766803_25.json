The transaction resulted in $3.3 million in tax-deductible goodwill attributable to the 1 to 1 segment and an additional $1.0 million in amortizable intangible assets. The acquisition is being accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141., 727048=On August 11, 2000, Valassis acquired 80% of the outstanding membership interest in PreVision for $30.0 million cash and approximately $5.0 million in restricted stock. PreVision is a direct marketing firm specializing in one-to-one marketing, customer retention and customer acquisition. The acquisition of PreVision was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions and, accordingly, the results of operations for PreVision have been included in our financial statements since the date of acquisition. The purchase agreement executed in connection with this transaction also contained additional payments contingent on the future earnings performance of PreVision. Based upon the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2001 for PreVision, Valassis paid an additional $8.0 million in 2002. In May 2003, we acquired the remaining 20% of PreVision for $2.4 million., 717680=The functional currencies for Valassis\u0092 foreign operations are the applicable local currencies. Accounts of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of the local currency on the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and average monthly exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Translation adjustments are reflected as an adjustment to equity on a cumulative basis, the impact for 2004 was an increase of $2.0 million., 179359=Included in other income for 2004 is a $6.5 million gain due to the settlement of a property claim related to a fire at the Corby, England facility., 561796=During the second half of 2002, Valassis identified indicators of possible impairment of its recorded goodwill related to its two subsidiaries, VRMS and PreVision. Such indicators included the general slowdown of the retail economy evidenced by general declines in consumer and business spending in marketing and promotions spending, the significant declines in valuations of technology-based companies in comparison with the market valuations at the time we invested in VRMS and PreVision and changes in our strategic plans for the acquired companies. Based upon the results of its discounted cash flow analyses and third-party valuations, we identified certain levels of impairment corresponding with the business unit goodwill initially recorded with the acquisitions of VRMS and PreVision. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment loss of $51.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 included in \u0093Goodwill and Investment Impairment Charges\u0094 on the consolidated statements of income., 113625=Certain statements under the caption \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u0094 including specifically statements made in \u0093Business Outlook\u0094 and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K constitute \u0093forward-looking statements\u0094 within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Valassis to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and to cause future results to differ from our operating results in the past. For a discussion of certain of these risks, uncertainties and other factors, see \u0093Risk Factors.\u0094 There can be no assurances, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Valassis disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise., 51463=During 2004, Valassis\u0092 Chief Executive Officer (CEO) provided to the New York Stock Exchange the annual CEO certification regarding Valassis\u0092 compliance with the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards., 39339=International & Services generated revenue of $99.1 million in 2004, or 9.5% of our total revenue. The top 10 customers accounted for approximately 18% of International & Services sales in 2004. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of this segment\u0092s revenue., 227679=Valassis formally documents its hedge relationships, including the identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction. Derivatives are recorded at fair value in other current and long-term assets and other current and long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. This process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether a derivative used in a hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. When it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting. Hedge ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with SFAS No. 133, did not have a material impact on operations for 2004 or 2003. No cash flow hedges were re-designated or discontinued during 2004 or 2003., 753041=2002, 115081=Valassis\u0092 results for 2004 reflect revenue growth in all of our business segments. While FSI revenues were up only slightly, our Cluster Targeted, 1 to 1 and International & Services segments all experienced double-digit revenue growth in 2004. Our ROP segment also contributed to the overall growth with a revenue increase in excess of 100%; however, the majority of this revenue increase is attributed to the changing fee structure for certain ROP contracts., 578683=Additionally, the remaining holders of the 2021 Notes may require Valassis to purchase all or a portion of their 2021 Notes on June 6, 2006, June 6, 2011 and June 6, 2016 at a price of $639.76, $742.47 and $861.67 per Note. Valassis had the right to pay for the June 6, 2006 put in either cash or Valassis common stock. In connection with an amendment to SFAS No. 128, in December 2004, Valassis waived its right to settle this put in common stock., 75582=Mar. 31, 195588=The holders of Valassis\u0092 Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes due in 2021 (the \u00932021 Notes\u0094) had the option to require Valassis to purchase all or a portion of their notes on June 6, 2004 at a price of $602.77 per $1,000 of principal amount at maturity, payable in cash or common stock at Valassis\u0092 option. Of the 86,840 bonds outstanding at that date, 64,272 were put back to Valassis. Valassis chose to settle the put with cash and, as such, paid $38.7 million on June 7, 2004 to the trustee of the 2021 Notes. The remaining debt balance related to the 2021 Notes is approximately $13.8 million, which represents the accreted value of the 2021 Notes as of December 31, 2004. The remaining holders of the 2021 Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on June 6, 2006, June 6, 2011 and June 6, 2016, at a price of $639.76, $742.47 and $861.67 per note, respectively, payable in cash. Valassis had the right to pay for the June 6, 2006 put in either cash or common stock. In connection with an amendment to SFAS No. 128, in December 2004, Valassis waived its right to settle this put in cash. Also, each holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder\u0092s notes if a change of control of Valassis occurs on or before June 6, 2006. Valassis, at its option, may redeem all or a portion of the 2021 Notes at their accreted value at any time on or after June 6, 2006, for cash., 177002=Cost of products sold was $748.1 million in 2004 compared to $619.9 million in 2003 and $538.6 million in 2002, increasing as a percentage of revenue each year. Gross margin in 2004 was 28.3% versus 32.3% in 2003 and 36.8% in 2002. The decrease in gross margin percentage from 2004 compared to 2003 and from 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily the result of competitive pricing issues in the FSI segment. FSI unit costs were flat as the result of mid-single digit increases in paper costs offset by decreases in media insertion due to an increase in average pages per book and a reduction in printing cost. Additionally, the gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by a change in mix resulting in a larger percentage of sales from lower margin products., 118625=We expect many of the macro-economic trends we saw in 2004 to continue into 2005. It is anticipated that customers will continue to link marketing spending to revenue generation, leading marketers to choose promotional alternatives that provide measurable return on investment. Customer marketing budgets are projected to be up moderately and continued economic recovery should lead to additional new product introductions. Marketing dollars should also shift to home-delivered promotional media due to increases in television fragmentation, the rise of television commercial blocking products, growth in commercial-free radio programming and greater participation in the National Do Not Call list. These trends should continue to have a positive impact on our business, increasing the marketing dollars our customers will allocate to the home-delivered promotional products we offer., 123079=2002, 518921=Valassis grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. We account for stock option grants in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, \u0093Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\u0094 and, accordingly, recognize no compensation expense for the stock option grants. Valassis will adopt SFAS No. 123R, as required, in 2005., 82879=October 1 through October 31, 859909=Years Ended Dec. 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, 10990=The applicable portions of Valassis\u0092 Proxy Statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on or about May 10, 2005 are incorporated by reference herein into Part III of this Annual Report on Form 10-K., 216179=In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, \u0093Share-Based Payment.\u0094 The standard, which is effective for the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005, requires that all equity-based compensation be recorded in the financial statements at the grant date fair value. Currently, we disclose the pro forma net income and related pro forma income per share information in accordance with SFAS No. 123, \u0093Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.\u0094 We are evaluating the method of adoption and the impact of this statement which could have a material impact on our results of operations., 342193=Balances at Dec. 31, 2001, 177941=Selling, general and administrative costs increased in 2004 to $133.1 million versus $120.3 million in 2003. The increase resulting from a full year of costs from NCH, which was consolidated beginning February 13, 2003 was $2.1 million. Nearly half of the remaining increase was due to increases in performance based incentive plans, with the balance due primarily to the acquisition of DMS and investments being made in future growth opportunities. Valassis also incurred a charge for the write-off of a cost-basis Internet investment of $3.5 million., 848416=Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this Report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the Registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated., 197180=The holders of the Senior Convertible Notes due in 2033 (the \u00932033 Notes\u0094) receive cash interest payments of 1.625% per year on the original discounted amount, payable semiannually from 2003 through 2008. The holders of the 2033 Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on May 22, 2008, May 22, 2013, May 22, 2018, May 22, 2023 and May 22, 2028 at a price of $667.24, $723.48, $784.46, $850.58 and $922.27 per Note, respectively, payable in cash or common stock at the option of Valassis. In connection with an amendment to SFAS No. 128, in December 2004, Valassis waived its right to settle these puts in common stock. Also, each holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder\u0092s 2033 Notes if a change of control of Valassis occurs. Valassis, at its option, may redeem all or a portion of the 2033 Notes at their accreted value at any time on or after May 22, 2008, for cash., 561280=On February 13, 2003, Valassis acquired 100% of the capital stock of NCH for $59.3 million in cash. Goodwill of $64.9 million was recorded and the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141. We do not expect that any of this recorded goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes., 508365=The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Valassis Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts for 2003 and 2002 have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications., 37412=NCH is a provider of promotion information management products, marketing services and coupon clearing in the United States and Europe and has production facilities in Mexico. Services include retailer coupon clearing, manufacturer redemption, electronic discount settlement and promotion analysis. During 2004, approximately 54% of NCH revenues were from Europe., 216949=In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, \u0093Inventory Costs\u0094. This Statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, \u0093Inventory Pricing,\u0094 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. As such, Valassis is required to adopt these provisions at the beginning of fiscal year 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 151 on our consolidated financial statements and do not believe that its adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity., 815649=We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Valassis Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \u0093Company\u0094) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders\u0092 equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. We also have audited management\u0092s assessment, included in the accompanying Management\u0092s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control\u0097Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company\u0092s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule, an opinion on management\u0092s assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits., 580800=In May 2003, Valassis issued 239,994 of its 2033 Notes at an issue price of $667.24 per note, which resulted in the gross proceeds to Valassis of $160 million. Each of the 2033 Notes has a yield of 1.625% per year with a maturity value of $1,000. The holders of the 2033 Notes will receive cash interest payments of 1.625% per year on the original discounted amount, payable semiannually from 2003 to 2008. Valassis used approximately $111.0 million of the proceeds of this issuance to repurchase $185.3 million in face value of the 2021 Notes. The resulting premium and write-off of fees and discounts resulted in the $3.9 million refinancing charge discussed above., 735134=2004, 729287=During December 2002, we wrote down $4.0 million of our cost-basis investment in an Internet couponing business based on the valuation implied during the investment\u0092s financing activity for the year. We had a remaining $3.5 million balance on this investment. In 2004, based on the information available, we wrote off the remaining value of the investment. Included in \u0093Goodwill and investment impairment charges\u0094 on the consolidated statements of income is a $3.5 million charge and a $4.0 million charge in 2004 and 2002, respectively., 715498=The Rights will become exercisable only in the event that any person or group of persons acquires 15% (or 20% in the case of a particular investor) or more of the Company\u0092s common stock or commences a tender offer for 15% or more of the Company\u0092s common stock. Once the Rights become exercisable they entitle the shareholder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock of the Company at an exercise price of $1.70. The Rights expire on September 1, 2009. The Company is entitled to redeem the rights at $0.01 per Right at any time, prior to the expiration of the Rights, before a person or group acquires the requisite amount of common stock to trigger the Rights., 180917=Diluted earnings per share were $1.93 in 2004, including the per-share effect of the property claim gain of $0.08 and the per-share effect of the investment write-off of $0.04, compared to $1.98 in 2003, and $1.77 in 2002, including the per-share impact of refinancing and impairment charges of $0.05 and $0.66 in 2003 and 2002, respectively., 36347=1 to 1 revenue in 2004 totaled $61.8 million, or 5.9% of our total revenue. The top 10 customers accounted for approximately 44% of 1 to 1 revenue in 2004, with no single customer accounting for more than 10% of 1 to 1 revenue during the same period., 654310=Total operating lease rentals, for various office space, charged to expense were $8.7 million, $7.4 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Entire minimum rental payments required under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2004 are as follows:, 582238=The holders of the 2033 Notes may require Valassis to purchase all or a portion of their 2033 Notes on May 22, 2008, May 22, 2013, May 22, 2018, May 22, 2023 and May 22, 2028 at a price of $667.24, $723.48, $784.46, $850.58 and $922.27 per 2033 Note, respectively, payable in cash or common stock at the option of Valassis. In connection with an amendment to SFAS No. 128, in December 2004, Valassis waived its right to settle these puts in common stock., 428780=Balances at Dec. 31, 2004, 241575=Our principal competitor in the cooperative FSI market, News America Marketing, has been competing aggressively for FSI business. As a consequence, prices trended downward in 2004 although we were able to regain some market share in 2004 in comparison to 2003 and the industry grew by a percentage in the mid-single digits. The combination of these factors has resulted in a slight increase in revenues and declining profitability for our FSI business. During the third quarter of 2004, we announced a strategy to increase Valassis pricing without a, 744095=2003, 828910=Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004. Our management\u0092s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein., 72395=High and low stock prices during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were:, 67133=In February 2005, Valassis purchased a 55,000 square-foot facility in Livonia, Michigan to replace its leased Plymouth, Michigan facility., 567557=Senior Convertible Notes due 2033, net of discount, 178866=Interest expense was $11.4 million in 2004, compared to $13.1 million in 2003 and $13.3 million in 2002. The refinancing of our long-term debt in May 2003 resulted in an overall reduction in our borrowing rate. In addition, Valassis entered into two interest rate swaps in 2004, which also lowered interest expense., 661432=Dec. 31, 2006, 189063=Valassis\u0092 liquidity requirements arise mainly from its working capital needs, primarily accounts receivable, inventory and debt service requirements. Cooperative FSI customers (except remnant space customers) are billed for 75% of each order eight weeks in advance of the publication date and are billed for the balance immediately prior to the publication date. FSI revenue accounted for 47.3% of Valassis\u0092 total revenue in 2004. Valassis inventories work in progress at cost while it accrues progress billings as a current liability at full sales value. Although Valassis receives considerable payments from its customers prior to the publication of promotions, revenue is recognized only upon publication dates. Therefore, the progress billings on the balance sheet include any profits in the related receivables., 728346=On July 1, 2002, Valassis exercised its option to acquire the remaining shares of Relationship Marketing Group, Inc. (\u0093RMG\u0094) for $4.5 million. As a result, our interest in VRMS was increased to approximately 89%. Effective July 1, 2002, our consolidated financial statements include the financial results of VRMS. An additional reclassification was made on our balance sheet for $31.1 million from \u0093Equity Investments and Advances to Investees\u0094 to \u0093Goodwill\u0094 for previous investments in VRMS. In March 2003, Valassis acquired the remaining 11% of VRMS for $1.0 million., 50311=For segment financial information for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, see the table titled \u0093Results of Operations\u0094 under \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations\u0094 and in Note 12 of the \u0093Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u0094 under Item 8 \u0093Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u0094, 90260=2004, 712072=The Executive Restricted Stock Plan provides for the grant of restricted stock, with a minimum one-year vesting, to certain executive officers. The maximum number of restricted shares that may be issued under this plan is 375,000, provided that not more than 60% of such shares are awarded to any one participant. Pursuant to employment agreements between Valassis and certain executives, 22,500 shares, 22,500 shares and 36,000 shares of restricted stock with an average fair value at the date of grant of $29.35, $29.43 and $35.62 per share, respectively, were issued to such executives in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Pre-tax compensation expense related to the plan for years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively., 87227=These shares have been repurchased under a 5 million share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors of Valassis on December 4, 2001. Previously announced programs of 5 million shares each, authorized in 1996, 1998 and 2000, respectively, have been exhausted. On December 7, 2004, the Board authorized an additional open market share repurchase program for up to 5 million shares., 192649=Cash used in financing activities was $71.2 million for the year ending December 31, 2004, primarily driven by $51.0 million used for the continued share repurchase program and the payment of $38.7 million in connection with the exercise of the June 6, 2004 put option by the bondholders of the Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes due 2021, as fully described below., 369504=Balances at Dec. 31, 2002, 800886=Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2004, 797016=Unexercised employee stock options to purchase 3.3 million shares, 5.9 million shares, and 1.5 million shares of Valassis\u0092 common stock as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were not included in the computations of diluted EPS because the options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common stock during the respective periods., 176395=2003 revenues were up $64.2 million, or 7.5%, over 2002 revenue. The acquisition of NCH in February 2003 accounted for approximately $71.0 million in revenue in 2003. Without this acquisition, revenues would have declined by less than 1%., 579817=The 2021 Notes are convertible by their holders at a conversion rate of 11.8316 shares per note when a market price trigger occurs. A market price trigger occurs the first time that the closing sales price per share of Valassis common stock for at least 20 trading days in any period of 30 consecutive trading days exceeds 120% of the accreted conversion price per share of common stock. The accreted conversion price as of any day is equal to the issue price of a 2021 Note plus the accrued original issue discount to that day. As of December 31, 2004, the accreted conversion price was $613.33., 833411=The information required by this Item is set forth in Valassis\u0092 Proxy Statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which information is hereby incorporated herein by reference, excluding the Stock Price Performance Graph and the Compensation/Stock Option Committee Report on Executive Compensation., 710202=The Employee and Director Restricted Stock Award Plan authorizes the grant of restricted stock to executives and to non-employee directors. A total of 300,000 shares of restricted stock have been reserved for this plan. Pursuant to employment agreements between Valassis and certain executives 13,500 shares of restricted stock were issued to such executives in both 2004 and 2003. The average fair value of these restricted stock grants in 2004 and 2003 was $29.35 per share and $29.43 per share, respectively. Pre-tax compensation expense related to these grants for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Also during 2004, 2003 and 2002, a portion of the total payments to our outside directors was paid in restricted stock from this plan, with a total value of approximately $137,000, $134,000 and $125,000, respectively., 78952=Dec. 31, 730002=During the fourth quarter of 2002, Valassis identified indicators of possible impairment of its recorded goodwill and recorded a writedown of $51.3 million related to VRMS and PreVision. See Note 2 for additional disclosures., 121919=Dec. 31,, 656090=2006, 707271=Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS No. 123, \u0093Accounting for Stock Based Compensation\u0094 and has been determined as if Valassis had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively: weighted-average dividend yield of 0%, 0% and 0%, expected volatility of 33%, 35% and 36%, weighted-average risk-free interest rates of 3.1%, 3.3% and 3.0%, and weighted-average expected lives of 6.0, 6.0 and 6.0 years., 218525=The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u0093SEC\u0094) has defined a company\u0092s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions. For additional information see Note 1, \u0093Significant Accounting Policies,\u0094 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004. Valassis does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates., 251827=Valassis has a revolving line of credit of $125.0 million with a variable rate of interest calculated on either a Euro Currency-based rate or a prime rate. As of December 31, 2004, there was no outstanding balance under this line of credit and, therefore, no exposure to interest rate risk., 820683=In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, management\u0092s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control\u0097Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control\u0097Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission., 652656=For financial statement purposes, the tax benefit of net operating loss and credit carry forwards is recognized as a deferred tax asset, subject to appropriate valuation allowances when it is determined that recovery of the deferred tax asset is unlikely. Valassis evaluates its net operating loss and credit carry forwards on an ongoing basis. In 2004, Valassis fully utilized the net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards assumed with the NCH acquisition. At December 31, 2004, Valassis retained $935,000 in credits and NOL carry forwards, the valuation allowance associated with net operating loss was $124,000., 723297=For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an unrealized market value gain of $129,000 in other comprehensive income. Actual exchange losses or gains are recorded against production expense when the contracts are executed. As of December 31, 2004, Valassis had a commitment to purchase $5.1 million in Mexican pesos over the next 12 months., 580591=Senior Convertible Notes due 2033, 28008=Total cooperative FSI sales during the year ended December 31, 2004 were $493.8 million, or 47.3% of our total revenue. The top 10 free-standing insert customers accounted for approximately 45% of FSI sales during the year ended December 31, 2004, and one customer accounted for more than 10% of such sales for the same period., 798467=The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003., 80558=The following table provides information about Valassis\u0092 purchases of equity securities that are registered by Valassis pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2004., 662111=Dec. 31, 2007, 199679=Valassis\u0092 contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004, are as follows:, 76699=June 30, 714906=On September 1, 1999, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Agreement, which was amended on October 10, 2003 (the \u0093Agreement\u0094). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Board declared a dividend of one Preferred Stock Purchase Right (\u0093Right\u0094) for each outstanding share of the Company\u0092s common stock. The Rights are attached to and automatically trade with the outstanding shares of the Company\u0092s common stock., 303076=Treasury stock, at cost (11,933,246 shares at Dec. 31, 2004 and 11,012,107 shares at Dec. 31, 2003), 866370=Year Ended Dec. 31, 2002, 836108=The information required by this Item is set forth in the Valassis Proxy Statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which information is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 808824=Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2003, 179685=Valassis incurred refinancing charges of $3.9 million in 2003 related to the partial buyback of convertible debt issued in 2001., 713256=All domestic full-time employees are eligible to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The plan provides that participants may authorize Valassis to withhold a portion of earnings to be used to purchase our common stock at prevailing market prices. Under the plan, Valassis contributed on behalf of each participant 25% of the participant\u0092s contributions during the year. The value of our stock contributed by Valassis and expensed totaled approximately $157,000, $108,000 and $86,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively., 117589=The February 2003 acquisition of NCH, with operations in the United States, Mexico and Europe, has expanded our product portfolio to include promotion information management products and coupon clearing services. We continue to focus on NCH\u0092s core expertise of managing the financial transactions between retailers and consumer packaged goods manufacturers related to their promotional activities., 398915=Balances at Dec. 31, 2003, 252968=Valassis has performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10% (or approximately 25 basis points) adverse movement in rates applicable to our variable interest rate swap. As of December 31, 2004, the analysis indicated that such movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations., 225137=Stock Compensation \u0096 Valassis grants stock options to its employees under various incentive plans. Options are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value on the date of grant. We account for all options under APB Opinion No. 25, \u0093Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,\u0094 and make various estimates used in calculating the pro forma results as required by SFAS No. 123. Valassis will adopt SFAS No. 123R, as required, in 2005., 471166=Dec.\u00a031,, 182899=FSI revenues in 2003 were also impacted by downward pricing pressure as well as a loss in market share, resulting in a revenue decrease of 14% compared to 2002., 671834=The following options to purchase our common shares were outstanding under the Plan on December 31, 2004., 657323=2009, 670816=At December 31, 2004, there were outstanding options among 1,385 participants for the purchase of 7,616,831 shares and there were 2,325,807 shares available for grant., 846801=March 11, 2005, 180179=Net earnings were $100.7 million in 2004, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 2.9% over 2003. Reported results include after-tax other income of $4.1 million, due to a property insurance claim settlement related to the Corby, England building fire and a $2.3 million, after tax, write-off of a cost-basis Internet investment in 2004 and after-tax refinancing charges of $2.5 million in 2003. Without the effect of these charges, earnings would have shown a decrease of 6.9% in 2004, due to the effects of the intense competitive pricing pressure in the FSI segment., 844616=Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized., 575712=In January 1999, Valassis issued the 2009 Notes which resulted in gross proceeds to Valassis of $100 million. Interest is payable on the 2009 Notes semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year., 577870=The holders of the 2021 Notes had the option to require Valassis to purchase all or a portion of their 2021 Notes on June 6, 2004 at a price of $602.77 per $1000 of principal amount at maturity, payable in cash or common stock at Valassis\u0092 option. Of the 86,840 Notes outstanding at that date 64,272 were put back to Valassis by the holders. Valassis elected to settle the put in cash and, accordingly, paid $38.7 million on June 7, 2004 to the Trustee of the 2021 Notes. The remaining debt balance related to the 2021 Notes is approximately $13.8 million, which represents the accreted value of the 2021 Notes as of December 31, 2004., 834426=The information required by this Item is set forth in Valassis\u0092 Proxy Statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which information is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 188190=The International & Services segment contributed revenues of $99.1 million in 2004, a 22.0%, or $17.9 million, increase over 2003. The inclusion of NCH for the entire year in 2004 accounted for $9.0 million of this increase and favorable European exchange rates accounted for an additional $4.5 million. This segment had revenue of $81.2 million in 2003 versus $8.5 million in 2002, as the result of the purchase of NCH with revenue of approximately $71 million., 566147=6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2009, net of discount*, 575508=6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2009, 725256=On February 13, 2003, Valassis acquired 100% of the capital stock of NCH for $59.3 million cash, paid for out of existing cash on hand. NCH is a coupon processing and promotion information management company both in the United States and worldwide. Goodwill of $64.9 million was recorded and the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141., 709021=The pro forma effects in 2004, 2003, and 2002 are not necessarily indicative of future pro forma adjustments. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management\u0092s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options., 542447=Valassis\u0092 debt is also a financial instrument with the estimated fair market value of the debt at $4.6 million below carrying value as of December 31, 2004 and $3.5 million above carrying value at December 31, 2003. See Note 3 for additional fair value disclosure., 245284=Our paper prices have historically experienced significant fluctuations. We have a limited ability to protect ourselves from these fluctuations or to pass increased costs along to our customers. We maintain on average less than 30 days of paper inventory. Significant increases in the cost of paper could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. To protect Valassis against the risk of price fluctuations, a significant portion of our paper requirements is purchased from two paper companies under long-term contracts. These contracts limit the amount of increases or decreases (to approximately 10% in any calendar year) of Valassis\u0092 cost of paper purchased from these suppliers. Such cost can be adjusted quarterly. As of January 1, 2004, approximately 90% of our FSI paper requirements were purchased pursuant to certain long term paper contracts which limit our exposure with respect to the price of paper during the term of those contracts. However, we cannot assure you that when such contracts expire that we will be able to replace such contracts with favorable terms or at all., 27628=The cost components of the FSI are media insertion, paper and print/freight costs, which represented approximately 44%, 30% and 26% of the total cost, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004., 116864=During 2004, we continued our strategy to grow our customer base. For the year ended December 31, 2004 approximately: 48% of our revenue came from consumer packaged goods manufacturers; 11% came from telecommunications; 11% came from specialty retailers; 9% came from food service; 8% came from direct response marketers; 6% came from grocery retailers (including drug, wholesale and mass merchants); 5% came from consumer services (i.e. financial, Internet); 2% came from other types of customers (i.e. automotive, hardware/software, newspapers)., 831456=The information required by this Item is set forth in Valassis\u0092 Proxy Statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which information is hereby incorporated herein by reference. On March 9, 2004, the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee adopted as its policy that Valassis will consider recommendations from shareholders of candidates for election as a director of Valassis and that the process for evaluating potential candidates recommended by shareholders and derived from other sources shall be substantially the same. Prior to this action the policy of the Committee had been not to consider candidates recommended by Valassis shareholders., 193396=As of December 31, 2004, Valassis\u0092 debt was $273.7 million, which consists of $100.0 million ($99.9 million, net of discount) of its 6\u00a05/8% Senior Notes due 2009, $13.8 million of Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes due 2021, and $160.0 million of Senior Convertible Notes due 2033. In addition, we have a revolving line of credit of $125 million with a variable rate of interest calculated on either a Euro currency-based rate or a prime rate. During the year ended December 31, 2004, there was no outstanding balance under this line of credit. Valassis was in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2004. All of our long-term debt contains cross-default provisions which become applicable if we default under any mortgage, indebtedness or instrument for money borrowed by Valassis and the default results in the acceleration of such indebtedness in excess of $25 million. Additionally, each of the Senior Convertible Notes contains conversion triggers based upon credit rating downgrades by either Moody\u0092s Investor Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor\u0092s Rating Group., 258678=Accounts receivable (less allowance for doubtful accounts of $4,755 at Dec. 31, 2004 and $3,344 at Dec. 31, 2003), 706616=Valassis has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, \u0093Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\u0094 (APB 25) and related Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. Because the exercise price of our employee stock options is greater than or equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. As discussed more fully in Note 1, we plan to adopt SFAS No. 123R effective July 1, 2005., 191434=Cash flow from operating activities was $76.8 million in 2004. This is the result of net earnings of $100.7 million adjusted for non-cash items, the largest of which are depreciation and amortization of $16.3 million. Changes in working capital accounted for a $52.0 million decrease in cash, primarily as a result of increased accounts receivable as of December 31, 2004. Accounts receivable increased due to increased sales activity to record levels in the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, collections within our ROP segment have been slower than anticipated causing an increase in days sales outstanding., 195021=In May 2003, Valassis issued $160 million of Senior Convertible Notes due in 2033, with a yield to maturity of 1.625% per year. We utilized approximately $111.0 million of the proceeds to repurchase $185.3 million in face value of our Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021. The resulting premium and write-off of fees and discounts resulted in a $3.9 million refinancing charge., 252295=By balancing the mix of variable- versus fixed-rate borrowings, Valassis manages the interest-rate risk of its long-term debt. In June 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements whereby we swapped fixed rates under our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2009 for variable rates equal to three-month average LIBOR, plus the applicable margin of approximately 230 basis points on $50.0 million notional value of debt. Three-month LIBOR was approximately 256 basis points as of December 31, 2004., 10576=As of March 1, 2005, there were 50,599,731 shares of the Registrant\u0092s Common Stock outstanding. As of such date, the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting stock held by non-affiliates* of the registrant was $1,087,000,000., 541606=Financial instruments that potentially subject Valassis to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. We place our cash in short-term high credit quality securities. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of Valassis\u0092 sales during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, or 2002. Generally, we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables., 213782=Capital expenditures were $18.9 million (net of $3.1 million in assets purchased from a settlement of property insurance claim related to a fire at our Corby, England facility) for the year ended December 31, 2004, largely representing technology enhancements and the purchase of a new printing press. Management expects future capital expenditure requirements of approximately $20 million to $25 million over each of the next three to five years to meet the business needs of enhancing technology and replacing equipment as required. It is expected these expenditures will be made using funds provided by operations., 185670=Our Cluster Targeted revenue increased 9.8% in 2004 to $275.2 million versus 2003. The major drivers of this growth were increased demand for solo inserts and polybag advertising programs and a continued rebound in customer product sampling. A renewed focus on enhancing margins resulted in an improvement in gross margin of over 200 basis points., 724454=On September 17, 2004, Valassis acquired DMS for $5.5 million from existing cash on hand and integrated its operations into its existing direct mail group. The transaction resulted in $3.3 million in goodwill attributable to the 1 to 1 segment and an additional $1.0 million in amortizable intangible assets. The acquisition is being accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141., 583352=The 2033 Notes are convertible by their holders when a market price trigger occurs. A market price trigger occurs the first time that the closing sales price per share of Valassis common stock for at least 20 trading days in any period of 30 consecutive trading days exceeds 120% of the accreted conversion price per share of common stock. The accreted conversion price as of any day is equal to the issue price of a 2033 Note plus the accrued original issue discount to that day. As of December 31, 2004, the accreted conversion price was $667.24. The 2033 Notes are convertible at a base rate of 15.1627 shares plus an incremental share factor of up to 9.8556. The incremental shares begin to accrue at the base conversion price, while the number of incremental shares is based upon the stock price at the time of the conversion. At May 22, 2008, the total conversion rate (base rate plus incremental shares) is fixed based upon the stock price as of this date., 30224=Total ROP sales were $114.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, or 10.9% of our total revenue. The top 10 ROP customers accounted for 94% of the ROP sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 and one ROP customer accounted for approximately 65% of such sales., 185120=Run of press revenue was up 34.3% in 2003 to $55.2 million versus 2002. This increase was due to increased demand from both existing and new customers and an increased sales focus., 656507=2007, 573614=At December 31, 2004, our public debt consists of 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2009 (the \u00932009 Notes\u0094), Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes due 2021 (the \u00932021 Notes\u0094) and Senior Convertible Notes due 2033 (the 2033 Notes, together with the 2021 Notes, collectively referred to as the \u0093Senior Convertible Notes\u0094). Each of the Senior Convertible Notes and the 2009 Notes are general unsecured obligations of Valassis and rank on parity in right of payment with all other Senior Indebtedness of Valassis. As of December 31, 2004, Valassis was in compliance with all of its debt covenants contained in the indentures covering its public debt. All of Valassis\u0092 public debt indentures contain cross-default provisions which become applicable if Valassis defaults under any mortgage, indebtedness or instrument for money borrowed by it and the default results in the acceleration of such indebtedness in excess of $25 million. In addition, each of the indentures covering the Senior Convertible Notes contain a conversion trigger based upon credit rating downgrades by either Moody\u0092s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor\u0092s., 685010=A summary of Valassis\u0092 stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, is as follows:, 51026=Valassis makes all of its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 available, free of charge, on its Web site at www.valassis.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission., 198935=As of December 31, 2004, Valassis had authorization to repurchase an additional 5.8 million shares of its common stock under its existing share repurchase program., 186195=In 2003 Cluster Targeted revenue was $250.7 million, a 26.3% increase over 2002. This increase was attributed to a strong rebound in product sampling and polybag advertising. In addition, solo preprints continued to grow, in part due to new customers in the retail category., 662772=Dec. 31, 2008, 579309=Further, each holder of the 2021 Notes may require Valassis to repurchase all or a portion of such holder\u0092s 2021 Notes if a change of control occurs on or before June 6, 2006. In addition, Valassis, at its option, may redeem all or a portion of the 2021 Notes at their accreted value at any time on or after June 6, 2006 for cash., 616081=Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be permanently reinvested amounted to $14.6 million at December 31, 2004 and $3.2 million at December 31, 2003. Accordingly, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on these earnings. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with permanently reinvested earnings is not practicable., 84611=December 1 through December 31, 67900=On October 22, 2004, a shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against Valassis, its Chief Executive Officer, Alan F. Schultz and its Chief Financial Officer, Robert L. Recchia. The Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case on March 10, 2005, without any payment, compensation or fees being provided to them., 213270=As of December 31, 2004, Valassis did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K., 2357=For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 or, 577096=Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes due 2021, 297814=Preferred stock of $.01 par value. Authorized 25,000,000 shares; no shares issued or outstanding at Dec. 31, 2004 and Dec. 31, 2003, 183237=Paper represents approximately 30% of the cost of products sold for our FSI business. Valassis purchases a combination of coated and uncoated paper. To protect Valassis against the risk of price fluctuations, a significant portion of our paper requirements is purchased from two paper companies under long-term contracts. These contracts limit the amount of increases or decreases (to approximately 10% in any calendar year) of Valassis\u0092 cost of paper purchased from these suppliers. Such cost can be adjusted quarterly. As of January 1, 2005, approximately 90% of our FSI paper requirements were under long-term contract. The remainder of our paper requirement is bought pursuant to contracts that are typically three to six months in duration or on spot basis. Valassis maintains on average less than 30 days of paper inventory., 525584=Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards granted since January 1, 1995, net of related tax effects, 192223=Net cash used in investing activities was $26.9 million, down from $68.1 million in 2003. Cash used in investing activities decreased in 2004 due to the decreased level of spending on acquisitions during the year from $48.4 million to $5.5 million., 214785=On September 30, 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) reached a consensus with respect to Issue No. 04-8, \u0093The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share.\u0094 The EITF\u0092s consensus states that shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to contingent convertible securities should be included in diluted earnings per share computations (if dilutive) regardless of whether their market price triggers (or other contingent features) have been met. Additionally, in its efforts to converge with international accounting standards, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued an Exposure Draft, \u0093Earnings Per Share\u0097an amendment of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128.\u0094 This Exposure Draft requires contracts that contain an option to settle in cash or stock be assumed to settle in stock for diluted earnings per share computations. Valassis has irrevocably waived its rights to settle the principal amount of its 2033 Notes and the June 6, 2006 put option related to the 2021 Notes in stock. Therefore, Valassis\u0092 diluted EPS is not affected by this pronouncement at the current stock price., 48731=In our International & Services segment, NCH competes against Carolina Manufacturing Services and Carolina Services, both owned by Inmar, Inc., and International Outsourcing Services, LLC for coupon clearing services in the United States. To the extent that our competitors in this business decide to compete more aggressively on price, it could lower our market share and negatively affect our revenue and profit margins., 23741=Cooperative free-standing inserts (FSIs) are four-color promotional booklets containing promotions from multiple customers, printed by us at our own facilities and distributed through Sunday newspapers. In 2004, we inserted our traditional cooperative FSIs in the Sunday edition of approximately 550 newspapers with a combined average newspaper circulation of 58.5 million on 41 publishing dates. Valassis also produces customized FSIs (custom co-ops) featuring multiple brands of a single customer., 118164=While we believe there continues to be growth opportunities in the U.S, we are expanding our geographic reach by testing new media products in Europe. We began testing new products in Germany, Spain and Italy in 2004 and will continue testing new media products and services in 2005., 577317=In June 2001, Valassis issued 272,100 of its 2021 Notes at an issue price of $551.26 per note, which resulted in gross proceeds to Valassis of $150 million. Each of the 2021 Notes has a yield of 3.0% with a maturity value of $1,000. In May 2003, Valassis purchased 185,260 of the 2021 Notes for approximately $111.0 million, which resulted in a $3.9 million refinance charge., 175709=Valassis achieved record revenues of $1,044.1 million in 2004, exceeding 2003 revenue by $127.6 million, or 13.9%. Valassis experienced growth in all segments, however, revenue for the FSI segment grew less than 1% and continues to be negatively impacted by an intense competitive pricing environment. Revenue growth includes $9.0 million from the inclusion of a full year of results for NCH versus 10 1/2 months in 2003 and $6.0 million due to the purchase of Direct Marketing Services in September of 2004., 250481=Currencies to which Valassis has exposure are the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, British pound and the Euro. Currency restrictions are not expected to have a significant effect on our cash flows, liquidity, or capital resources. Valassis typically purchases the Mexican peso under three to 12-month forward foreign exchange contracts to stabilize the cost of production in Mexico. Under SFAS No. 133, our Mexican peso forward exchange contracts meet the definition of a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an unrealized market value gain of $129,000 in other comprehensive income. Actual exchange losses or gains are recorded against production expense when the contracts are executed. As of December 31, 2004, Valassis had a commitment to purchase $5.1 million in Mexican pesos over the next 12 months., 656906=2008, 668745=Valassis\u0092 Amended and Restated 1992 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorizes option grants for the issuance of a maximum of 13,045,921 shares of common stock with exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the shares at date of grant. Subject to termination of employment, and except as otherwise provided in the plan, these options expire not later than ten years from date of grant, are not transferable other than on death, and fully vest based on price targets and/or terms up to five years from date of grant., 186829=The 1 to 1 segment had revenue of $61.8 million in 2004, an increase of $23.0 million or 59.3% over 2003. Approximately $6.0 million of this growth relates to the purchase of DMS, the direct mail division of Catalina Marketing. The remainder of the increase is due to our enhanced retail relationships and increased demand for frequent shopper data-driven direct mail programs., 584493=Debt discount is being amortized utilizing the interest method over the term of the notes. The difference between the stated and effective interest rates is nominal. The estimated fair market value of the debt was $4.6 million below carrying value and $3.5 million more than carrying value as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. The fair market value was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on discount rates equivalent to comparable U.S. Treasury securities plus a spread for credit risk and other factors. The fair market value of convertible debt was estimated using theoretical value as determined through the binomial model. The indentures covering the public debt contain certain restrictive covenants that prescribe limits on Valassis\u0092 ability to, among other things, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, incur liens, make certain stock redemptions and stock repurchases, and enter into mergers, consolidations or convey or transfer substantially all of its property., 562961=Amortizable intangible assets include non-compete agreements and corporate logos. The associated amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was approximately $294,000., 90136=Dec. 31,, 72036=Valassis\u0092 common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker symbol VCI). The approximate number of record holders of Valassis\u0092 common stock at December 31, 2004 was 207., 298599=Common stock of $.01 par value. Authorized 100,000,000 shares; issued 63,125,207 at Dec. 31, 2004 and 63,084,261 at Dec. 31, 2003; outstanding 51,191,961 at Dec. 31, 2004 and 52,072,154 at Dec. 31, 2003, 230080=Valassis expects earnings per share for 2005 to be between $1.80 and $2.00, based upon the following assumptions:, 822466=March 14, 2005, 190902=Cash and cash equivalents totaled $188.1 million at December 31, 2004 versus $207.4 million at December 31, 2003. This decrease was the result of cash provided by operating activities of $76.8 million and cash used by investing activities and financing activities of $26.9 million and $71.2 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2004., 582870=Further, each holder of the 2033 Notes may require Valassis to repurchase all or a portion of such holder\u0092s 2033 Notes if a change of control occurs. In addition, Valassis, at its option, may redeem all or a portion of the 2033 Notes at their accreted value at any time on or after May 22, 2008 for cash., 716356=In addition, as of December 31, 2004, Valassis had authorization to repurchase an additional 5.8 million shares of its common stock under its existing share repurchase program. Valassis repurchased 1.9 million shares, 700 shares and 2.8 million shares during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively., 33528=In 2004, Cluster Targeted products generated revenue of $275.2 million, or 26.4% of our total revenue. The top 10 customers accounted for approximately 40% of Cluster Targeted sales during the year ended December 31, 2004. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of Cluster Targeted sales during the same period., 182029=In 2004, FSI revenue increased 0.7% to $493.8 million compared to 2003. The increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in units (pages) due to industry growth and a gain in market share of approximately 2%, offset by a high single-digit reduction of average price caused by the current intense competitive environment. The cooperative FSI industry continues to show unit growth with industry pages increasing by a percentage in the mid-single digits in 2004. FSI unit costs were flat as a result of mid-single digit percentage increases in paper costs, offset by the efficiencies in media insertion costs caused by higher average pages per book, and reduced production costs., 516466=Intangible assets largely consist of goodwill arising from our acquisitions. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. We adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 and initial testing indicated no impairment. During the second half of 2002, we identified indicators of possible impairment of recorded goodwill and accordingly wrote down $51.3 million of goodwill related to two subsidiaries, VRMS and PreVision. See Note 2 for additional disclosure., 115723=The cooperative FSI industry experienced mid-single digit unit (page) growth in 2004. While industry page growth was positive and our FSI market share increased, overall FSI pricing declined in 2004, in comparison to 2003. This decline in FSI pricing had a negative impact on profits in the FSI segment. During the third quarter of 2004, we announced a strategy to increase Valassis pricing without a loss in market share. The results of this initiative are yet to be conclusive, although we are cautiously optimistic that Valassis\u0092 FSI pricing will begin to improve. Due to the multi-year nature of FSI customer contracts, the economic impact of the competitive pricing environment will continue into future periods even if pricing improves for new contracts. 2005 FSI revenues are expected to be down by a percentage in the low-single digits due to lower pricing on contracts negotiated in 2003 and 2004 that will affect cooperative FSI business placed in 2005., 122033=2004, 187384=1 to 1 revenues were up 15.5% in 2003 to $38.8 million versus 2002. Approximately $4.2 million of this growth related to the inclusion of VRMS for the entire year in 2003 versus only six months in 2002., 68462=On November 9, 2004, Valassis received a letter dated November 8, 2004 from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) informing us that the FTC is conducting a non-public investigation to determine whether Valassis may have engaged in unfair method of competition or unfair acts and practices in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by soliciting an agreement with a competitor to fix prices and to allocate customers. As the FTC pointed out in their letter of November 8, 2004, neither the letter or the existence of this investigation should be construed to indicate that a violation has occurred or is occurring. Valassis is fully cooperating with the FTC., 725832=The Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes the financial results of NCH from February 14, 2003 to December 31, 2003 which included revenues of approximately $71.0 million. NCH had revenues of $80.1 million and $72.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The financial results of NCH were not considered material for purposes of pro forma disclosure. Revenues consist primarily of processing fees for coupon audit and analysis, data and information management, data analytics, trade marketing programs, and the management and disbursement of customer funds for coupon administration. We do not recognize revenue, or cost of services, for the face value of coupons processed. Once coupon processing has been completed, fee revenues are recognized., 184424=Revenue for ROP increased 106.9% in 2004 to $114.2 million. Changes in terms of certain contracts away from transaction-fee based business (net revenue) to gross revenue business accounted for $48.6 million of this increase. The remaining 22% increase was due to incremental business, most notably in the telecommunications customer segment. The gross margin in this segment has declined, due to a shift in business to larger volume customers at lower margins, however operating profits grew in excess of 15% for 2004., 865129=Year Ended Dec. 31, 2003, 44385=Our principal competitor in the cooperative FSI market, News America Marketing, competed aggressively for FSI business. As a consequence, prices trended downward in 2004, although we were able to regain some market share in 2004 in comparison to 2003 and the industry grew by a percentage in the mid-single digits. The combination of these factors resulted in a slight increase in revenues and declining profitability for our FSI business. During the third quarter of 2004, we announced a strategy with the goal of increasing Valassis pricing without a loss of market share. The results of this strategy remain inconclusive and a continuation or acceleration of the competitive trends could have a material adverse effect on our financial results., 83715=November 1 through November 30, 670121=In 2002, the Board and the Shareholders approved the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan which authorizes the issuance of 3,500,000 shares of common stock with exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the shares at date of grant. Subject to termination of employment, and except as otherwise provided in the plan, these options expire not later than ten years from date of grant, are not transferable other than on death, and fully vest over terms ranging from six months to five years from date of grant., 665994=On November 9, 2004, Valassis received a letter dated November 8, 2004 from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) informing us that the FTC is conducting a non-public investigation to determine whether Valassis may have engaged in unfair method of competition or unfair acts and practices in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by soliciting an agreement with a competitor to fix prices and to allocate customers. As the FTC pointed out in their letter of November 8, 2004, neither the letter nor the existence of this investigation should be construed to indicate that a violation has occurred or is occurring. Valassis is fully cooperating with the FTC., 49520=As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 4,100 full-time employees worldwide. Approximately 1,600 are employed in the United States. None of our United States employees are represented by labor unions; however, some of our foreign employees are represented by labor unions. We consider labor relations with employees to be good and have not experienced any interruption of our operations due to labor disagreements., 655696=2005, 8356=Indicate by check mark whether the registrant (1) has filed all reports required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and, (2) has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days:, 572321=On November 1, 2002, Valassis replaced its then existing revolving line of credit with a $125.0 million revolving credit facility pursuant to an agreement with Standard Federal Bank, N.A., Comerica Bank, Harris Trust and Savings Bank and Fifth Third Bank (collectively, the \u0093Banks\u0094) with Standard Federal Bank, N.A. acting as Agent for the Banks (the \u0093Revolving Credit Agreement\u0094). The Revolving Credit Agreement matures in November 2006 and permits Valassis to increase its line of credit to an amount up to $175 million. The floating rate interest is calculated on either a Euro currency based rate or a prime rate. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains general covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio, a funded debt to EBITDA ratio and non-financial covenants. As of December 31, 2004, Valassis did not have any outstanding borrowings under this facility and was in compliance with all debt covenants thereunder., 566853=Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes due 2021, net of discount, 576091=During June 2004, Valassis entered into two interest rate swap agreements whereby it swapped fixed rates under the 2009 Notes for variable rates equal to three-month LIBOR (which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis), plus the applicable margin of approximately 230 basis points on $50.0 million notional value of debt. The counter parties to these interest rate swap agreements are major commercial banks. Under these agreements, Valassis agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified variable-rate of interest times a notional principal amount and receive in turn an amount equal to a specified fixed-rate of interest times the same notional amount. The notional amount of the contract is not exchanged. As of December 31, 2004, these interest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting treatment as a fair value hedge., 863897=Year Ended Dec. 31, 2004, 34463=Valassis produces direct-mail programs based on multiple data sources. We have experienced increased demand for direct-mail programs targeted based on frequent shopper card data. These programs may utilize Valassis\u0092 internal variable image print capability, VRMS\u0092 software analytics and Valassis\u0092 Aztec Code technology. In September of 2004, Valassis acquired Catalina Marketing\u0092s Direct Marketing Services (DMS) business and has since integrated the sales and operations into the Valassis 1 to 1 business segment., 122556=2003, 663451=Dec. 31, 2009, 722200=During June 2004, Valassis entered into two interest rate swap agreements whereby we swapped fixed rates under our 2009 Notes for variable rates equal to three-month average LIBOR, plus the applicable margin of approximately 230 basis points on $50.0 million notional value of debt. Our interest rate hedging transaction is tied to the three-month average LIBOR interest rate, which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis. The counter-parties to our interest rate swap agreements are major commercial banks. Under these interest rate swap contracts, we agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified variable-rate of interest times a notional principal amount and receive in turn an amount equal to a specified fixed-rate of interest times the same notional amount. The notional amount of the contract is not exchanged. As of December 31, 2004, Valassis\u0092 interest rate swap qualified for hedge accounting treatment., 714184=Valassis\u0092 401(k) Plan included a 25% match, payable in Valassis stock, on each participant\u0092s annual contributions to the Plan that are invested in Valassis stock at the end of the year. The expense related to this plan for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $195,000, $151,000 and $251,000, respectively., 708135=No options were granted with exercise prices greater than market value in 2004, 2003, and 2002. The weighted average per share fair value of options granted at market value was $12.10 in 2004, $11.11 in 2003 and $12.87 in 2002. The weighted-average exercise price of options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $30.75, $26.92 and $31.83, respectively., 660781=Dec. 31, 2005}",
