            "East Central is definitely a cheaper school but you get amazing professors and a beautiful campus!",
            "You can always go to the park which is not far from campus, there's Fieldhouse, and many other things to do for fun.",
            "They caff food is surprisingly good! You have so many options to pick from! Anywhere from pizza to salad, to pasta, to burgers!",
            "They dorm life has its ups and downs just like any other campus. You never have to drive to class! A major down for me is the shower situation. They showers in Pesagi stink! But thankfully they are putting new showers in this summer.",
            "East Central is a great university. Because of its smaller size you really get to know all of your professors on a personal level. They are also building an amazing new business building for all of you business majors!"

There is also a great sense of school pride here, so if your favorite colors are orange and black, there's no better place! Tips for prospective students Go to class! College is such a great experience but you are there first and foremost as a student. If you go to class and show your professors that you are making an effort you should have no trouble being successful at ECU. Bang for the buck There are tons of scholarship opportunities here and I have been lucky enough to not have to pay for any of my education. Even if I did have to pay my own tuition, though, I believe it would be well worth it. Am enjoying being here The only",
