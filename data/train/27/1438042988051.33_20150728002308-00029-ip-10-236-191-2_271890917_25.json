    "textBeforeTable": "The figures presented in this release are unaudited. The company has adopted certain new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations at the beginning of the financial period as described in the Financial Statements for 2011. However, the adoption of these new and amended standards has not yet had an effect on the reported figures in practice. In other respects, the same accounting policies have been followed as in the Financial Statements for 2011. Key indicator calculations remain unchanged. The Interim Report has been prepared in accordance with the IAS 34 Interim Reports standard. Basis of preparation SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES JANUARY 1 - MARCH 31, 2012 With regard to the development of the turnover and the operating result, variation is expected between the quarters in comparison to the corresponding quarter during the previous year as well as to the previous quarter as a consequence of, among others, long sales cycles and the relatively big impact of individual deals on the development of net sales and operating result. Stonesoft aims for at least 30% growth of net sales and a positive result for the year 2012. Based on Stonesoft's view, these issues will continue to have a positive impact on the company's net sales and profitability and will strengthen its competitiveness and market position as the general understanding and knowledge about advanced evasions techniques grow. The above mentioned issues have opened new business opportunities",
