According to the invention, in order to achieve a stability of corresponding solar cells or solar cell modules produced therefrom against a potential induced degradation (PID), the dielectric passivation layer is formed from the surface of the substrate in the process chamber by means of a plasma containing an oxidizing gas. 20150064835 12-06-2012 SOLAR CELL MODULE - The invention relates to a solar cell module comprising electrically interconnected solar cells with front and backs, a transparent first layer running along the front sides, which is covered on the front laterally by a transparent cover, as well as a second layer running along the backsides, which is covered at the back by a second cover. In order to prevent and/or minimize a potential-induced reduction to a large extent and/or obtain an improved stability vis-\u00e0-vis thermo-cycling, it is suggested that first layer consists of a first polymer material and the second layer consists of a second polymer material deviating from the first polymer material and the fact that specific resistance is larger p 20120305056 07-19-2012",

A power plant is disclosed which is ready for the retrofit of a CO2 capture plant, and a method is disclosed for retrofitting an existing plant into a power plant with CO2 capture. A power plant part is disclosed which can provide steam and power to operate CO2 capture system, and provide a CO2 capture system, which has the capacity to remove CO2 from flue gas flow of the power part, and of the additional power plant part. 08-30-2012 Ingo Nagel, Karlsbad DE Patent application number Description Published 20120117772 Device for working, in particular stamping and joining, of a work piece, and a working tool - An apparatus for working has an upper tool. A lower tool co-operates with the upper tool. The lower tool is arranged on a turntable of the apparatus. The turntable is pivotable from a loading position, in which the turntable is remote from the upper tool, to a working position, in which the lower tool is aligned with the co-operating upper tool. By a pivoting movement of the turntable, the work piece, inserted into the apparatus when the turntable is in the loading position,",
