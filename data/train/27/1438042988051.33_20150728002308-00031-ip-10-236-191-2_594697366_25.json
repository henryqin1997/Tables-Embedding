The yield of green tea leaf since inception upto 30th June, 1997 was 200 M.T. approx. A target of 500 M.T. of green tea leaf is attempted during the current year. As there is no suitable alternative at present, green tea leaf are sold to the Jirighat Tea Estate, Cachar, Assam @ Rs. 5 Kg. (ex factory). The Corporation has collected a revenue of Rs. 10 lakhs upto the end of June, 1997. Considering the increasing trend of yield and productivity and also to arrest unremunerative income from sale of green tea leaf, a modern tea factory is being installed at Manipur Tea Estate, Jiribam., 117019=February - April/August-October, 36713=1999-00, 232351=22629, 52860=3.6 In addition to the above mentioned strengths and opportunities, the State Govt. has fully taken note of the Central Govt.\u0092s new economic policy initiatives in the post-1991 era to:, 289159=1240, 79376=2001-02, 36044=2000-01, 50633=3.5. Manipur, though located in a far flung north-eastern corner of the country and largely hilly terrain in its landscape, it has got many areas of strength and opportunities that justifies investment in the State. The existing Indo-Myanmar Border Trade currently underway in the border towns of Moreh & Tamu has already paved the way for a full scale trade between India and Myanmar which would further extend to other adjacent countries, like Thailand, Laos, South West China along the old Burma road and the proposed Trans-Asia Highway and railway. In this context, Manipur is the gate way to the International trade route connecting between Indian sub-continent including Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. Resultantly, not only the production and trading units can flourish taking advantage of the expanding international trade but there is also good scope for investment in creating infrastructure facilities in the areas of road construction, power generation, developed industrial areas, water facilities, IT services, etc., 228329=91820, 28788=1500.0 MW, 235244=11639, 226298=As per the National Handloom & Powerloom Census conducted during the year 1996-97, population of looms & weavers in Manipur are given hereunder:-, 173108=2005, 172760=2004, 33709=1991-01, 79018=1999-00, 119094=Tea grows wild in this State since time immemorial. However, plantation of tea for commercial production has been started from the year 1981-82 by Manipur Plantation Crops Corporation Limited in Jiribam., 255620=April, 1996 to March, 1997, 26973=The peak power requirement of Manipur by the year, 2006-07 and 2011-12 as per the 16th Electric Power Survey of India are 252 MW and 406 MW respectively. The Region has many more ongoing projects. There will not be any shortage of power for the region as a whole and for the State of Manipur as well for another 10 years., 275815=There are many trained Artisans / Entrepreneurs in the Cane & Bamboo trade in the State. Various Central/State Government Departments/Offices under various schemes through either departmental training centres or implementing agencies/ Mastercrafts persons have conducted training programmes for Cane & Bamboo in various parts of the State since last many years. In the State, there are also a number of skilled artisans having got training in Fine Bamboo & Cane Works from BCDI, under the O/o the DC(H/C), Government of India, Agartala. Data on the number of passed out trainees in Cane & Bamboo trade as on 31 st March, 2001 for the departmental training centres under the Department of Commerce & Industries, Manipur and Office of the Development Commissioner (Handicrafts), Ministry of Textiles, Government of India are given below., 67034=2000-01, 17494=The soil cover can be divided into two broad types, viz. the red ferrogenous soil in the hill area and the alluvium in the valley. The soil generally contains small rock fragments, sand and sandy clay and are of varieties. The top soil on the steep slopes are very thin. In the plain areas, especially flood plains and deltas, the soil is of considerable thickness. Soil on the steep hill slopes is subjected to high erosion resulting into formation of sheets and gullies and barren rock slopes. The normal pH value ranges from 5.4 to 6.8. The climate of the State is salubrious with approximate average annual rainfall varying from 933 mm at Imphal to 2593 mm at Tamenglong. The temperature ranges from sub-zero to 36 o C., 257300=April, 1998 to March, 1999., 58322=The transport subsidy will be extended for a further period of seven years i.e. upto 31 st March, 2007., 262655=VCD, Inverters, Battery, Precious stones, narcotic drugs (Amphetamine tabs.,Ephedrine, Heroine Powder, etc), Blanket, Cloth carpet, Myanmar currency, detergents, soap, readymade garments, shoes, chapples, edibles, etc., 173456=2006, 35001=1991, 216265=4.2.10 Serpentinite and Idocrase Processing Industries, 216399=Serpentinites occur extensively in Chandel and Ukhrul Districts of Manipur within the Ophiolite Belt which spread over about 1600 sq. km. of area., 218483=4.2.12 Exploration, 160710=The most striking area is the production of pineapple (Kew-variety), having special taste and flavour. There has been demand of such pineapple products from MAGFRUIT by the C.I.S. countries. The MAGFRUIT had exported 168 MT of canned pineapple products to the erstwhile U.S.S.R. from the year 1983-84 to 1985-86. As the units are in the SSI and the cottage scale sectors, they are often in a disadvantageous condition for continuous tapping of such export markets. Moreover, these units are hardly kept in operation due to various constraints like inadequate working capital, non-availability of quality control system as well as inability to link up with the big marketing agencies in the cosmopolitan cities like Calcutta, Chennai, Delhi , Mumbai ,etc. Once the sufficient production of such processed fruits and vegetables is made (with strict maintenance or quality, packaging and reasonable price), there is a big marketing potential not only in the local market, but also in major cities of our country and even export to the countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Dubai, Singapore, Nepal, Bangladesh, U.S.A., Germany, etc. Setting up of the identified projects based on modern technology and in the medium/large scale sector are most essential for the development of food processing industries in the State., 30259=The State Power Department has completed construction of Heavy Fuel Based Power Project (6x6 MW) at Leimakhong. Trial run test of the six units has been done successfully in March and April, 2002. Commercial operation is being started shortly. Once the project is commercially operated the peak hour shortage of the State can be minimised., 150454=4.1.11 Market Potential:, 210706=11200 Rm., 256460=April, 1997 to March, 1998, 117407=April - July, 29593=1654.5 MW, 139568=Scope for future cultivation: There is quite a good scope for cultivation of rubber in Jiribam area. In general,rubber trees can be put under tapping after 7 years of plantation and the financial returns would outpace the investment once tapping/production of raw rubber commences. As per Rubber Board Index expenditure norm, around Rs. 40,000/- per Ha. is the expenditure upto 7th Year of plantation and taking an average yield of 1000 kg of raw rubber per Ha. and market price (conservative figure) of RS. 40/- per kg, the return would be to the tune of Rs. 40,000/- per Ha. In other words, the investment made during the first 6-7 years may be said to have been recovered in the first year of tapping & production. Since rubber trees can be put under effective tapping for 25-30 years, the total return per Ha would be quite high., 45368=3.1 The North Eastern Region of India lags in development far behind the national average. The availability of basic minimum services is very poor. The continuing gaps in infrastructural sectors have resulted in industrial backwardness of the Region. Recognising this, position, the Prime Minister announced on 27 October, 1996 \"New initiatives for the North Eastern Region\" along with a Rs. 6100 crores special economic package including Rs. 703 crores for Manipur., 116650=December - March, 162053=4.1.12 Proposed Projects:, 7947=1.3 However, Manipur although bottled up in the North Eastern corner of India, is gradually emerging as an important gateway for external trade. International imagination has been excited of a South Asia Development Triangle - including eastern and North \u0096 eastern India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh - an extension of which within a larger growth quadrant takes in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and South-west China along the old Burma Road and the proposed Trans-Asian Highway and Railway. With this in the backdrop, the restoration of Indo-Myanmar Border Trade via Moreh in Manipur and the just concluded Ganga Treaty with Bangladesh herald a new chapter for international trade through Manipur with South-East Asian countries. An ever widening market for industrial products in the State would warrant greater investments to precast new industries in Manipur even without awaiting the international trade route to develop fully. Such industries should obviously be based either on the wider demand or the availability of raw materials locally, or both. Given the high level of investment and management capability, the enterprises could well flourish with adequate return., 11178=Manipur has a population of 23.88 lakhs (2001 Census provisional figure). Of the total population, 58.9% live in the valley and the remaining 41.1% are in the hill areas. The hills are inhabited mainly by the tribals and the valley by the Meiteis (including Meitei Muslims). The distribution of area, population and density, literacy rate, etc. as per the 2001 Census provisional figures are as below:, 127275=1238.40, 171155=4.2.2 Demand, Supply and Prospect: There is a bright prospect for developing cement industries in Manipur. The principal major consumers of cement in the State are the State Government departments and various industries and private individuals. The present annual demand of cement in Manipur is roughly 1.86 lakh tonne. Assuming a growth rate of 13.2%, the projected demand of cement in the State year wise for the years from 2002 to 2006 are estimated below:, 172064=2002, 27318=The State Power Department is currently engaged in taking necessary actions for generation of at least 1654.5 MW as below:-, 173890=Viewing from the volume of demand of cement indicated above, it is highly prospective to put up new cement units in the State, at least a 200 TPD plant. Since about 87% of the total raw material requirement are limestone and clay which are locally available and considering the huge transportation cost involved in bringing cement from outside the State, setting up of new cement units in the State has definite economically competitive advantage. The product from such local units will also have a ready market in Myanmar through Moreh since the Indo-Myanmar border trade is now flourishing. Measuring the competitive advantage of export alone to Myanmar, Manipur thus has a distinct investment potential in cement industry., 10091=Situated between latitudes 23.80 o N to 25.68 o N and longitudes 93.03 o E to 94.78 o E, Manipur covers a total geographical area of 22,327 Sq.Km. Of the total area, about nine-tenths constitute the hills which surrounds the remaining one-tenth valley. It is one of the border States in the North-Eastern part of India, bounded by Nagaland on the north, Assam on the west and Mizoram on the south and along the east it shares a 352 Km. long international boundary with Myanmar., 34357=2001, 117776=August - November, 132035=1083.60, 118146=December - March., 66702=1998-99, 259808=April, 2001 to March, 2002, 230416=31420, 216350=4.2.11 Prospects :, 150509=The disadvantageous geographical situation and severity of the terrain have been standing in the way of industrial development and trade particularly of the Food Processing Industries which can thrive only through value addition and cost efficiency. It is high time to explore this untapped sector as processed fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, ginger, spices and rice etc. are having good demand in the local and export market. At present, many of such processed fruits and vegetables are imported to this State from other States and neighbouring countries through Myanmar. At the same time some of the units in this sector have been established and are being run successfully, catering to the local demand. This indicates existing potential available in this sector., 138187=Rubber Plantation under Forest Department, Manipur started in 1977-78 in Jiribam area covering about 938 Ha., 223238=1876.00, 263058=2000-2001, 223785=From time immemorial handloom industry has been playing a vital role in the state economy. The traditional skill of handloom weaving was not only a status symbol for the women-folk but it was also an indispensable aspect of the socio-economic life. Handloom weaving is by far the largest and the most important cottage industry in the state. As per the National Handloom census reports 1996-97, there are 3.39 lakh weavers with 2.77 lakh different looms producing 86.40 lakh linear metre of handloom cloth per month., 129164=1465.44, 45875=3.2 Pursuant to the \"New Initiatives\", the Central Government appointed a High Level Commission to critically examine the backlog in respect of the basic minimum services and the gaps in important sectors of infrastructure development in the region and suggest policies, programme and the requirement of funds to bridge such gaps and backlogs. The Commission has in its report entitled \"Transforming the Northeast\" (March, 1997), made an exhaustive 173 recommendations touching upon 27 areas for development. These, among others, include power, roads, civil aviation, railways, waterways, telecommunications, banking and financing, trade and transit, industry, etc. The report recommends a total of about Rs. 9,396 crores for the whole region\u0092s requirement in respect of basic minimum services, of which Rs, 1,423 crores is for Manipur. It also makes room for an indicative requirement of Rs. 93,619 crores as total estimated investments in infrastructural sectors for the region as a whole, of which Manipur\u0092s share is Rs. 5,815 crores., 79197=2000-01, 188986=2126 tonnes, 254781=April, 1995 to March, 1996, 262331=1999-2000, 250238=The Indo-Myanmar Border Trade was inaugurated on 12.4.95 by the then Union Minister of State for Commerce, as a follow-up measure of the Trade Agreement signed between the two countries on the 21st January, 1994, at New Delhi. The opening of the Border Trade along the Tamu (Myanmar)-Moreh (Manipur) sector is quite significant as this would act as an economic bridge between industrially developed India and the blooming economies of South East Asian countries., 288997=1020, 142140=4.1.10 Identification of Feasible Industrial Projects in Manipur:, 44142=ii) At 1993-94 prices, 66867=1999-2000, 31815=The per capita net income (SDP) of the State based on a quick estimate at current prices is Rs. 11,370/- for 1999-2000 as against the All India Average of Rs. 16,047/-. The average annual growth rate of the State Domestic Product is 10.52% in 1999-2000 as against 8.03% of the manufacturing sector., 219380=4.2.13 Project Cost, 258975=April, 2000 to March, 2001, 263421=2001-2002}",
