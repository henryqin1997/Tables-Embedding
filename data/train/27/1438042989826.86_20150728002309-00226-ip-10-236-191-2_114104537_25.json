Verbs are divided into five types according to the way they are conjugated. \u00a0\u00a01. kuru ( to come ) \u00a0\u00a02. suru ( to do ) and compound verbs that end with suru. \u00a0\u00a03. aru ( to exist ) \u00a0\u00a04. all verbs which end with -iru or -eru, except a few which belong to Type 5. \u00a0\u00a05. all verbs which end with -u, except those belong to Types 1 to 4. Notes: 1.\u00a0\u00a0There is another kuru, which means to draw near or wind ( rope, cord, string, line, etc.) or turn (pages). It is a Type 5 verb. Being archaic, it is often replaced by taguru for drawing near or mekuru for turning pages. 2.\u00a0\u00a0Kanzuru (to perceive) belongs to Type 2, but in colloquialism it has been replaced by kanjiru, which belongs to Type 4. 3.\u00a0\u00a0There is another suru, which means to strike ( a match ), pick ( a pocket ) and lose ( money in betting ). It is a Type 5 verb. 4.\u00a0\u00a0Aru is a Type 5 verb, except that the negative form is irregular. 5.\u00a0\u00a0 Iru, which means to stay or exist, and eru, which means to obtain, belong to Type 3, while the iru, which means to need, and the eru, which means to",

For example, the negative form of omou (to think) is omowanai. These verbs used to have -f at the end of their stems, which they have either changed to -w, assimilated to other consonants, or just lost, as time went by. \u00a0\u00a0omowanai < omofanai < omofu (to think) + nai \u00a0\u00a0omotta (past form) < omofta < omofitari < omofu + tari \u00a0\u00a0omoeba < omofeba < omofu + ba Cardinal forms have no tense of their own. Cardinal forms are something like infinitives of the imperfect aspect, except when they are used as predicate verbs of the main clauses, in which case they represent the present or the future tense. eiga o miru ( to see a movie) Jon wa mainichi eiga o miru.
