When Router B replies to the ping packet, it replies to the source address (that is, 172.31.20.1). This way, only the connectivity between the serial 0 interface of Router A (172.31.20.1) and the Ethernet interface of Router B (192.168.40.1) is tested., 102237=To test the connectivity between Router A's Ethernet 0 (172.16.23.2) and Router B's Ethernet 0 (192.168.40.1), we use the extended ping command. With extended ping, we get the option to specify the source address of the ping packet.}",

The command reference guides include the task IDs required for each command. If you suspect user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for assistance. Information About Implementing Host Services and Applications To implement Cisco\u00a0IOS\u00a0XR software Host Services and applications features discussed in this document, you should understand the following concepts: Network Connectivity Tools Domain Services TFTP Server File Transfer Services Cisco inetd Telnet Network Connectivity Tools Network connectivity tools enable you to check device connectivity by running traceroutes and pinging devices on the network.
