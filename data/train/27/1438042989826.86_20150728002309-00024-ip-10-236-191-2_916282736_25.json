(Note the superfish.js for Drupal 8 won't include the IE6\\7 hack hence no $.browser trouble!) Drupal 7 users: jQuery 1.6.1 or higher, only if you want to use the jQuery Easing plugin animation effects. Drupal 6 users: jQuery 1.3.x or higher. (sfTouchscreen in the Master branch of the Superfish library requires at least jQuery 1.4.) jQuery Update Download Superfish library master branch for the latest development release. Download Superfish library 1.x for the latest stable release. Superfish library Requirements: And a whole lot more... Plenty of built-in options for designers. RTL (Right-to-left) language support. Window width (client-side) and UA string (client-side and server-side) detection for touch and small screen plugins (no CSS3 media-queries) Small-screen compatible. (<select> and vertical accordions) Touch-screen compatible. (almost) Automatic sub-menu width calculation (Supersubs plugin), automatic sub-menu placement (Supposition plugin; prevents sub-menus from appearing off-screen.) Automatic width calculation (sfAutomaticWidth plugin) (Use the development release)",
