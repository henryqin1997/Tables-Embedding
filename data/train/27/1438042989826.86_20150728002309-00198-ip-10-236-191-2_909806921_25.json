            "Hard-workers who love the city. If you like being a small town with not many crowds and not a lot of people, don't go here. It's still a great school if you need one-on-one attention, though; the professors are very flexible with working with you. You need to be devoted and be a hard worker though, and NOT go out partying every night. I see kids going to party every single night, and they're basically paying $55,000 a year to get drunk. It's a shame.",
            "Work well during your senior year to get good financial aid! Also, if you haven't already try taking an advanced chem course your senior year - it'll help you out a lot during CH101! If you're thinking premed, don't be scared - there are many horror stories out there about people not following through because everything's too hard, but if you work you can do it!",
            "Definitely an expensive school, but if you look poor enough on paper and do well in high school, you'll get great financial aid! This is a very rich school, so they have a lot of money to give away. Also, even though it's expensive I really think it's worth it - I love every minute here. The only thing that is definitely really over priced is the dorms; I live in Warren and it is definitely not worth around $2,000 a month.",
            "I absolutely love it here! BU has a great atmosphere - everybody is so friendly and the place is just fun! I also love how the campus is situated; it's smack dab in the city (right near Fenway, by the way), but if you don't leave the campus you'd never even know you were in Boston. BU is like its own little city, but you can take a ten-minute T ride and go anywhere you need to! It's just a great place to be at; so many of my friends hate where they are, but I'm loving it here!",
            "I am definitely learning a lot here at BU, but I'm not gonna lie - the chemistry program is HARD! I'm in CH101 (gen chem 101), and even though it's considered an introductory course, it's very hard. You need to study often, and the course takes up a lot of your time with online homework and studying in general. I definitely have learned a lot in all of my classes during my first semester, and it is hard, but it will be so worth it to pass these classes."

Also, study hard because Boston University accepts mainly AP class kids and 2000 SAT score kids., 40346=As soon as I visited BU on Accepted Students Day in Spring of 2010 I knew I wanted to go here! Ever since it's been perfect. I can absolutely see myself here for the completion of my undergraduate career. The only reason why I'm not really considering it for graduate school is because of the weather - coming from Maine, I'm already sick of the winters. I always say that BU is in its own corner of Boston; if we want to stay only around college peers all we have to do is stay on campus, but there's literally a 5 minute walk to Kenmore Square, 10 minutes to Fenway, and 20 minutes to Newbury St. It's amazing!, 584975=It is what you make of it, Busy schedules don't leave a lot of time for social interaction on the floor. I met my roommate on BU facebook page class of 2017. We chatted for several weeks before we felt we were compatible. We love the same music, books, poetry and we are both science majors. Our floor has monthly meetings, but we haven't had any social outings yet., 548355=The new mean SAT score at BU is 2016, and it's rising every year-- 2013 had an all time low admittance rate of around 30%. It sits right across the river from the mavericks: MIT and Harvard-- and it's doing everything in its power to compete., 612040=Unfortunately, SATs are one of the most important things BU looks at when awarding financial aid. Make sure you score above a 1950 and you'll probably get a merit scholarship., 694949=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608687=There is a huge seal on the ground in Marsh Plaza (located in central campus) that is rumored to hold bad luck (namely, no diploma awarded) for those students who walk over it. After graduation in May, one can see many graduated seniors triumphantly standing on top of it, having their pictures taken., 225778=I love living in Warren Towers. It houses about 1800 students (primarily freshman) and you get that true dorm living lifestyle!, 329832=All dining foods are great. There are special nights in each dormitory where chefs come in and compete. The GSU (student union center) also has good food. There is a new dining place opening fall 2012 with a whole new variety. There are literally tons of good restaurants in nearby Boston that anyone could access although the food may be a little overpriced., 126853=Let this be a cautionary tale for those with tight budgets (or budgets at all...)- This is the only field I can really fill out- I just got accepted here as a transfer student, and I was nominated for a scholarship through my community college. Shortly after my acceptance, however, I received notice of my financial aid assistance. Out of the $50,000+ in tuition and fees, I was eligible to receive only $9,100, which includes the loans they offered me, which is a hole I am not planning on digging for myself. No- I did not receive my scholarship, and I was frankly not expecting to. A scholarship is a gift, a happy surprise. But still - the ONLY need-based aid they were willing to give me was my $2600 Pell Grant! Seriously? Let me give you my background- I am one of four children. We live in a *tiny* condo. Only *one* of my parents works full-time, and his pay schedule is at times unreliable. OK, we do have enough money to eat, be clothed, and have heating and electricity, but still! We don't go on exotic vacations. We do stay-cations in Boston. Or sometimes hop on a bus to NYC to visit my aunt and baby cousins. C'mon. I'm sorry, no matter how great of an academic/social/whatever experience other students have had, this is a big deal-breaker. I kind of hope this some mistake- someone forgot to add an extra zero, or they fell asleep at the calculator. But I am only too sure that I would be so wrong., 352084=You name it they have it. I am into music, accapella and theater groups. However, there are so many to mention. SPLASH, in September, is where they all come together.}",

There is definitely something for anyone as long as you are willing to look. Tips for prospective students Save save save your money and work work work hard! Then you will get the bang for your buck. Bang for the buck Simply put, BU is expensive. Am enjoying being here There is so much to do here! Thousands of students that provide student-led activities as well as the school providing stuff to do. For example, at BU Central, students book bands to come and play for students for FREE! The school also does things for students, like teh parade held last year to honor the hockey team in their national victory.",
