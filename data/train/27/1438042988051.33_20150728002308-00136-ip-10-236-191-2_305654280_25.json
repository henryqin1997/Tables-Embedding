    "textBeforeTable": "Advanced Catching Metrics No BP Roundtables have mentioned this guy. BP Roundtables I think he might be the most anonymous backup catcher in the league. You're right that he's done decently when called upon, but he's also a tough player to peg; he struggled during his initial exposures at Double- and Triple-A and never earned much prospect consideration. In a sense, it kinda reminds me of how Martin Maldonado popped up out of nowhere and became a solid backup. Anyway, my guess is that Perez won't get traded. At least not anytime soon. (R.J. Anderson) I really like catcher Roberto Perez of the Indians. He seems like a pretty decent player (good defense, pitch framing, underrated at the plate). Obviously he's not going to unseat Gomes as the starter, but can you see a team possibly trading for him and giving him some playing time? I ask this as a fantasy owner of course, not as an Indians fan. (Kyle from Ohio) 2014-08-29 12:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) Answer Question Date BP Chats",
