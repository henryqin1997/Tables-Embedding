A series of intense purge attacks occurred to assure that the \"Jack Greeners\" (Heritage Club) and anyone who supported the new \"Re-Formed\" (Prygun) movement in Oregon, would stay away or be secondary quests to their new social order. The new\u00a0 H.H.-U.M.C.A. became nearly a totally \"spiritually clean\" place, void of a \"devil on the roof,\" and zealots could appear with little or no stigma. Sunday School attendance dropped by 90% from its peak in the 1960s. Youth were now required to wear kosovorotki (boys) and kosinki (girls) as chulok molodoi sobranie (Young Church) continued to a third generation, replacing Sunday School and Wednesday Night Church., 195938=Because zealots protested that ne nashi (outsiders) were listed in the dispora 1980 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d Directory, in the mid-1980s, an unreported census tally of American congregants was attempted by William Alex Federoff, editor of the U.M.C.A. newsletter for 30 years with his sons. He was the only person who sent me a letter stating he did not want his name or family listed in the 1980 Directory. He gave no reason, but when the book was distributed at the grand opening of the Resident Center in Los Angeles, Federoff briefly confided in person that he wanted to be listed in the next edition. To satisfy zealots and himself, Federoff proposed that the next directory should only list nashi, Dukhizhiznik congregation members in good standing, not anyone who wanted to be listed, especially those unclean (nichistye :\u00a0 \u043d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0435) people who married out, eat pork, joined other faiths, etc. His request for membership lists from all congregations was rejected by many and the project dropped. When I asked my father, the presbyter in Arizona, for such a list, I learned that only a few of the many adherents (attenders) ever paid annual dues, because the most zealous majority officially claimed that they, by their tradition, did not believe in \"membership\" or worldly lists. Maybe they just did not want to donate, though in their family tradition the Book of Life is a spiritual list known only to God. Due to these competing hostilities, and fears that government will intervene among the variety of Dukhizhiznik faiths, it is probably impossible to ever collect a census list, hence all population counts are somewhat educated guesses., 198741=In the early 1970s, the L.A.-U.M.C.A. added more classrooms and very popular club attendance nearly stopped during construction. To boost attendance, about 1974 Mike founded what became the \"Our Gang\" singles club, I was hired to be Athletic Director, and Mike was appointed to the Recreation Committee. We got to know each other well., 201402=The 2 groups (social and practicing) did not clash much because the L.A.-U.M.C.A. was self-forbidden ground for the most zealous Dukhizhizniki, where the Christian faction, many of them Y.R.C.A.-ers (\"Jack Greeners\"), dominated as teachers since 1938., 195210=Between these extreme population definitions, about 5000 diaspora households (~20,000 descendants, assuming 4 per household) were willing to be listed in an English language unpublished diaspora English 1985 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d Directory, though about half are neither practicing Dukhizhizniki nor Molokane by faith. People affiliated with the \"Molokan\" label should be several times larger than that estimate, in the year 2000, perhaps 60,000+. For the current relative populations in the Former Soviet Union, multiply by at least 10 up to 100 times.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "italic;\">Diaspora Dukhobor oral history reported a belief, adapted from Church Slavonic, that God recognizes his chosen people who pronounce /\u0413/ (/g/) correctly.

Spirit-Wrestlers blog.) \u00a0 Dialect (M > N) \u2014 In Arizona, the Dukhizhiznik head singer Mike John Tolmachoff scolded anyone who did not pronounce words as he had learned. He insisted that the male name \"Nikifor\" and his ancestral village \"Nikitino\" must be pronounced \"Mikifor\" and \"Mikitino.\" Russians recognize this shift from \"M\" to \"N\" as\u00a0Ukrainian. Mikifor is a Polish variant, and a Russian variant spelling and popular form for Nikifor. M.J. Tolmachoff believed he spoke a sacred dialect. His clan is descended from the sister of M.G. Rudomyotkin (from Nikitino village), and some claimed to have inherited his \"spiritual blood.\" Dialect (Slavonic) \u2014 Diaspora Dukhizhizniki retained the pre-1918 Cyrillic alphabet, some archaic words and sacred Old Slavonic vocabulary in their liturgy. To the the most zealous, changing the words, or updating the Russian spelling or alphabet, is heresy.

Those indoctrinated for generations by the most zealous diaspora Dukhizhizniki evolved an over-stress (strongly voiced) in their pronunciation dialect; for example,",
