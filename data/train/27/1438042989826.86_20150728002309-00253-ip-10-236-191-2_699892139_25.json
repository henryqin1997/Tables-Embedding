Investing in the notes is not equivalent to investing directly in either or both Indices or any of the component securities of either or both Indices. These risks are explained in more detail in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the accompanying product supplement no. 4-I dated November 14, 2011 and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the accompanying underlying supplement no. 1-I dated November 14, 2011., 113910=Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel it is reasonable to treat the notes as \u201copen transactions\u201d that are not debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming this treatment is respected, the gain or loss on your notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the issue price. However, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or a court may not respect this treatment of the notes, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be significantly and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of \u201cprepaid forward contracts\u201d and similar instruments, which might include the notes. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require holders of these instruments to accrue income over the term of their initial investment., 3757=$ Return Notes Linked to the Capped Upside Return of the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan Index and the Downside Return of the S&P\u00a0500\u00ae Index due April 4, 2013, 20676=March 12, 2012, 23400=You should read this term sheet together with the prospectus dated November 14, 2011, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated November 14, 2011 relating to our Series E medium-term notes of which these notes are a part, and the more detailed information contained in product supplement no. 4-I dated November 14, 2011 and underlying supplement no. 1-I dated November 14, 2011.

    "textBeforeTable": "If both Indices remain flat or appreciate between the pricing date and the Observation Date, the Capped Upside Return will reflect any appreciation of the Upside Index, subject to the Maximum Return, and the Downside Return will be equal to 0%, regardless of any appreciation of the Downside Index. The following table and examples illustrate the hypothetical total return at maturity on the notes under these circumstances. Scenario A: Both Indices remain flat or appreciate between the pricing date and the Observation Date. The following tables and examples illustrate the hypothetical total return at maturity on the notes, assuming a range of performances for the Indices. The \u201ctotal return\u201d as used in this term sheet is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the payment at maturity per $1,000 principal amount note to $1,000. The hypothetical total returns set forth below assume an Initial Index Level of 530 for the Upside Index, an Initial Index Level of 1,350 for the Downside Index and a Maximum Return of 35.00%. The actual Maximum Return will be determined on the pricing date and will not be less than 35.00%. The hypothetical total returns set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual total returns applicable to a purchaser of the notes.

Example 1: The Index closing level of the Upside Index increases from the Initial Index Level of 530 to an Ending Index Level of 609.50. Because the Ending Index Level of the Upside Index of 609.50 is greater than its Initial Index Level of 530 and the Index Return of 15% does not exceed the hypothetical Maximum Return of 35.00%, the Capped Upside Return is equal to 15%. Because the Downside Index remains flat or appreciates between the pricing date and the Observation Date, the Downside Return is 0%. Accordingly, the investor receives a payment at maturity of $1,150 per $1,000 principal amount note, calculated as follows: $1,000 \u00d7 (1 + 15% + 0%) = $1,150 Example 2: The Index closing level of the Upside Index increases from the Initial Index Level of 530 to an Ending Index Level of 795. Because the Ending Index Level of the Upside Index of 795 is greater than its Initial Index Level of 530 and the Index Return of 50% exceeds the hypothetical Maximum Return of 35.00%, the Capped Upside Return is equal to 35.00%.
