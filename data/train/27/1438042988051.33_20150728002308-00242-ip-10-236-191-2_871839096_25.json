Ole Miss at Kentucky Saturday, 4 p.m. Rupp Arena Lexington, Ky.

The Wildcats haven't played since last Saturday, and that's enough of a concern for John Calipari that he resolved not to let the Cats get too relaxed this week. His strategy included an open practice designed to keep his team on its toes. Kentucky's been on a roll. Did time off let the Cats catch their breath, or did it slow some of their momentum? Second Chances A 102-76 home loss to Vanderbilt on Thursday did serious damage to any NCAA Tournament hopes Ole Miss had.",
