To find the status of the request Find the request in Search Requests or in My Requests (use My Requests if you are investigating your own request). Open the request resource. On the Detailed Content tab, review the actual requested changes. Note the value that is listed in Request Status. Case\u00a01: Request Status is \u201cDenied\u201d If the Request Status is Denied, refer to the Scenario: A request\u2019s Request Status is \u201cDenied\u201d section. Case\u00a02: Request Status is \u201cFailed\u201d If the Request Status is Failed, refer to the Scenario: A request\u2019s Request Status is \u201cFailed\u201d section. Case\u00a03: Request cannot be found If the request resource cannot be found, an error was likely encountered during the process of creating the request. The request may have timed out. The default timeout configuration for operations submitted to the FIM Service is 58 seconds, so if you notice that the request is taking longer than 58 seconds to process, the problem is likely due to a timeout. To collect more information to investigate the issue Repeat the request that is failing. Click Start, Programs, Administrative Tools, and then click Event Viewer. Click Applications and",
