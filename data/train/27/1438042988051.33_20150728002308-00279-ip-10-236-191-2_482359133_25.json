The LD10 or maximum tolerated dose of Capxol\u2122 in this study is equivalent to approximately 1000 mg/m2 in humans. This is significantly higher than the approved human dose of 175 mg/m2 for Taxol., 18591=This application is continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/446,783 filed May 16, 2000, now abandoned, having the international filing date of Jun. 26, 1998; which is a national stage application of PCT/US98/13272, filed on Jun. 26, 1998; which claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/051,021, filed Jun. 27, 1997; and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/926,155, filed Sep. 9, 1997, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,096,331; and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/720,756, filed Oct. 1, 1996, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,596, the content of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety., 42530=Weiss et al., in \u201cHypersensitivity Reactions from Taxol,\u201d Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol. 8, No. 7 (July 1990) pp. 1263-1268, reported that it was difficult to determine a reliable overall incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, HSRs, because of the wide variations in Taxol doses and schedules used, and the unknown degree of influence that changing the infusion schedule and using premedication has on HSR incidents. For example, of five patients who received Taxol in a 3-hour infusion at greater than 190 mg/m2 with no premedication, three had reactions, while only one out of 30 patients administered even higher doses over a 6-hour infusion with no premedication had a reaction. Therefore, this suggests that prolonging the infusion to beyond 6 hours is sufficient to reduce HSR incidents. Nevertheless, Weiss et al. found that patients receiving 250 mg/m2 of Taxol administered via a 24-hour infusion still had definite HSRs. Thus, while prolonging drug infusion to 6 or 24-hours may reduce the risk for an acute reaction, this conclusion can not be confirmed, since 78% of the HSR reactions occurred within ten minutes of initiating the Taxol infusion, which indicates that the length of time planned for the total infusion would have no bearing. Further, concentration of Taxol in the infusion may also not make a difference since substantial numbers of patients had reactions to various small Taxol dosages. Finally, not only is the mechanism of Taxol HSR unknown, it is also not clear whether Taxol itself is inducing HSRs, or if the HSRs are due to the excipient (Cremaphor EL; Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik AG [BASF], Ludwigshafen, Federal Republic of Germany). Despite the uncertainty as to whether or not premedication had any influence on reducing the severity or number of HSRs, prophylactic therapy was recommended, since there is no known danger from its use., 40773=Wiernik et al. in \u201cPhase I Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Study of Taxol,\u201d Cancer Research, 47, 2486-2493 (May 1, 1987), also report the administration of Taxol in a cremophor vehicle by IV infusion over a 6-hour period in a Phase I study. Grade 3-4 hypersensitivity reactions incurred in 4 of 13 courses. The starting dose for the study was 15 mg/m2 (one-third of the lowest toxic dose in dogs). Doses were escalated, and a minimum of 3 patients were treated at each dose level until toxicity was identified, and then 4-6 patients were treated at each subsequent level. The study concluded that neurotoxicity and leukopenia were dose-limiting, and the recommended Phase II trial dose was 250 mg/m2 with premedication., 62984=In accordance with the present invention, there are provided compositions and methods useful for in vivo delivery of biologics, in the form of nanoparticles that are suitable for parenteral administration in aqueous suspension. Invention compositions comprise stabilized by a polymer. The polymer is a biocompatible material, such as the protein albumin. Use of invention compositions for the delivery of biologics obviates the necessity for administration of biologics in toxic diluents of vehicles, for example, ethanol and polyethoxylated castor oil, diluted in normal saline (see, for example, Norton et al., in Abstracts of the 2nd National Cancer Institute Workshop on Taxol & Taxus, Sep. 23-24, 1992). A disadvantage of such known compositions is their propensity to produce severe allergic and other side effects., 145861=Three ml of a USP (United States Pharmacopia) 5% human serum albumin solution (Alpha Therapeutic Corporation) were taken in a cylindrical vessel that could be attached to a sonicating probe (Heat Systems, Model XL2020). The albumin solution was overlayered with 6.5 ml of USP grade soybean oil (soya oil). The tip of the sonicator probe was brought to the interface between the two solutions and the assembly was maintained in a cooling bath at 20\ufffd C. The system was allowed to equilibriate and the sonicator turned on for 30 seconds. Vigorous mixing occurred and a white milky suspension was obtained. The suspension was diluted 1:5 with normal saline. A particle counter (Particle Data Systems, Elzone, Model 280 PC) was utilized to determine size distribution and concentration of oil-containing protein shells. The resulting protein shells were determined to have a maximum cross-sectional dimension of about 1.35+0.73 microns, and the total concentration determined to be \u02dc109 shells/ml in the original suspension., 37098=Brown et al., in \u201cA Phase I Trial of Taxol Given by A 6-Hour Intravenous Infusion\u201d J of Clin Oncol, Vol. 9 No. 7, pp. 1261-1267 (July 1991) report on a Phase I Trial in which Taxol was provided as a 6-hour IV infusion every 21 days without premedication. 31 patients received 64 assessable courses of Taxol. One patient had a severe (or acute) hypersensitivity reaction, which required discontinuation of the infusion and immediate treatment to save the patient's life. Another patient experienced a hypersensitivity reaction, but it was not so severe as to require discontinuing the infusion. Myelosuppression was dose-limiting, with 2 fatalities due to sepsis. Non-hematologic toxicity was of Grade 1 and 2, except for one patient with Grade 3 mucositis and 2 patients with Grade 3 neuropathy. The neuropathy consisted of reversible painful paresthesias, requiring discontinuation of Taxol in two patients. Four partial responses were seen (3 in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, and one in a patient with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary). The maximum tolerated dose reported was 275 mg/m2, and the recommended Phase II starting dose was 225 mg/m2. The incidence of hypersensitivity reaction was reported to be schedule-dependent, with 6 to 24-hour infusions of drug having a 0% to 8% incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. It was also reported that hypersensitivity reactions persist with or without premedication despite prolongation of infusion times. Since these Phase I studies were conducted on terminally ill patients suffering from a variety of cancers, the efficacy of the Taxol treatments could not be determined., 180285=115 mg Cyclosporin A are dissolved in 1 mL butyl acetate, and mixed with 2 grams of a 4:1 solution of Triton X-100:n-Butanol. A clear system is obtained. 10 g water is added dropwise, while slightly shaking. A clear oil-in-water microemulsion is obtained. 10 g of 1% casein solution is added, while slightly shaking. The system becomes slightly turbid. The butyl acetate is removed in a rotovap, at 400\ufffd C., 80 mm Hg. The system becomes completely clear., 207758=The paclitaxel BDS and the paclitaxel standard (99.9%, Hauser Chemical Research, INC., Lot 1782-105-5) were quantitatively dissolved in acetonitrile and injected into the HPLC separately. 10 \u03bcl of 1.00 mg/ml paclitaxel BDS and 10 \u03bcl of 2.07 mg/ml standard paclitaxel were injected. The retention time of the dominant peak of paclitaxel BDS matches the retention time of the paclitaxel standard from Hauser., 181778=119 mg of Cyclosporin A are dissolved in butyl acetate, and mixed with 2 grams of a 4:1 solution of Triton X-100:propylene glycol. A clear system is obtained. 7 g water is added dropwise, while slightly shaking. A clear oil-in-water microemulsion is obtained. 7 g of 1% casein solution is added, while slightly shaking. The system becomes slightly turbid. The sample is diluted 1:1 with water, prior to solvent evaporation. The butyl acetate is removed in a rotovap, at 400\ufffd C., 80 mm Hg. The system becomes completely clear. This process also yielded extremely small nanoparticles: Z-average 45 nm, and diameter by volume and number distribution is 11 nm., 350638=The rationale for selecting the initial dose for Phase I/II trials will be based on the significantly lower preclinical toxicity data (Single dose LD10 data in mice) for the Capxol\u2122 formulation compared to the BMS formulation. The single dose LD10 in mice is determined to be 398.1 mg/kg. Conversion of this dose to a surface area basis (3 times the mg/kg value) gives an estimate of 1194.3 or about 1200 mg/m2. A conservative starting dose 1/10th of this value for humans results in a dose of 120 mg/m2. However, it is already well established that paclitaxel is safe at a dose of 175 mg/m2 and based on a pilot study with Capxol\u2122 showing lower myelosuppression in rats, a dose of 175 mg/m2 should be safe for the Capxol\u2122 formulation. The Capxol\u2122 solution will be delivered in approximately 15-30 minutes or less, if possible., 169952=g. Following evaporation of solvent, the liquid dispersion of nanoparticles may be dried to obtain a powder containing the pharmacological agent and optionally the protein, which can be redispersed into a suitable aqueous medium such as saline, buffer, water, and the like, to obtain a suspension that can be administered to a life-form, having a particle size below 1000 Angstroms. Acceptable methods of obtaining this powder are by freeze-drying, spray drying, and the like. If the conversion into a solid form is performed by lyophilization, various cryoprotectants may be added, such as manitol, lactose, albumin, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrolidone, maltodextrins, and/or polyethylene glycol., 260314=The effective dose of paclitaxel for a patient typically lies between 200-500 mg, depending on the patient body weight or body surface. Taxol\ufffd has to be administered at a final dosing concentration of 0.6 mg/ml, requiring large infusion volumes (typically in the range of about 300-1000 ml., 262051=For Taxol, a dose of 30 mg/kg was uniformly lethal within 5 minutes of intravenous administration. For the same dose, the nanoparticle formulation according to the invention showed no apparent toxic effects. The nanoparticle formulation at a dose of 103 mg/kg showed some reduction in body weight of the mice, but even this high dose was not lethal. Doses of approximately 1000 mg/kg, 800 mg/kg and 550 mg/kg were all lethal but differing in time to lethality, which ranged between a few hours to 24 hours. Thus, the lethal dose of the invention formulation is greater than 103 mg/kg but less than 550 mg/kg., 32249=Bazile et. al., in Biomaterials 13:1093 (1992), and Spenlehauer et al., in Fr Patent 2 660 556, have reported the formation of nanoparticles by using two biocompatible polymers, one (e.g., polylactide) is dissolved in the organic phase, together with an active component such as a drug, and the other polymer, such as albumin, is used as the surface active agent. After emulsification and removal of the solvent, nanoparticles are formed, in which the drug is present inside the polymeric matrix of the polylactide particles., 98249=In contrast to the invention process, the prior art method of glutaraldehyde crosslinking is nonspecific and essentially reactive with any nucleophilic group present in the protein structure (e.g., amines and hydroxyls). Heat denaturation as taught by the prior art significantly and irreversibly alters protein structure. In contrast, disulfide formation contemplated by the present invention does not substantially denature the protein. In addition, particles of substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agents contained within a shell differ from crosslinked or heat denatured protein microspheres of the prior art because the polymeric shell produced by the invention process is relatively thin compared to the diameter of the coated particle. It has been determined (by transmission electron microscopy) that the \u201cshell thickness\u201d of the polymeric coat is approximately 25 nanometers for a coated particle having a diameter of 1 micron (1000 nanometers). In contrast, microspheres of the prior art do not have protein shells, but rather, have protein dispersed throughout the volume of the microsphere., 144842=The lyophilized samples contain residual solvent at levels<1000 ppm, and more preferably <500 ppm, or even <100 ppm., 251160=Cyclosporine is currently delivered in oral form either as capsules containing a solution of cyclosporine in alcohol, and oils such as corn oil, polyoxyethylated glycerides and the like, or as a solution in olive oil, polyoxyethylated glycerides, and the like. It is also administered by intravenous injection, in which case it is dissolved in a solution of ethanol (approximately 30%) and cremaphor (polyoxyethylated castor oil) which must be diluted 1:20 to 1:100 in normal saline or 5% dextrose prior to injection. Compared to an intravenous (i.v.) infusion, the absolute bioavailibility of the oral solution is approximately 30% (Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation, Publication SDI-Z10 (A4), 1990). In general, the i.v. delivery of cyclosporine suffers from similar problems as the currently practiced i.v. delivery of Taxol, i.e., anaphylactic and allergic reactions believed to be due to the Cremaphor, the delivery vehicle employed for the i.v. formulation. In addition, the intravenous delivery of drug (e.g., cyclosporine) encapsulated as described here avoids dangerous peak blood levels immediately following administration of drug. For example, a comparison of currently available formulations for cyclosporine with the above-described encapsulated form of cyclosporine showed a five-fold decrease in peak blood levels of cyclosporine immediately following injection., 41522=Other exemplary studies on Taxol include: Legha et al., \u201cPhase II Trial of Taxol in Metastatic Melanoma,\u201d Vol. 65 (June 1990) pp. 2478-2481; Rowinsky et al., \u201cPhase I and Pharmacodynamic Study of Taxol in Refractory Acute Leukemias,\u201d Cancer Research, 49, 4640-4647 (Aug. 15, 1989); Grem et al., \u201cPhase I Study of Taxol Administered as a Short IV Infusion Daily For 5 Days,\u201d Cancer Treatment Reports, Vol. 71 No. 12, (December, 1987); Donehower et al., \u201cPhase I Trial of Taxol in Patients With Advanced Cancer,\u201d Cancer Treatment Reports, Vol. 71, No. 12, (December, 1987); Holmes et al., \u201cPhase II Study of Taxol in Patients (PT) with Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC),\u201d Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Vol. 10, (March, 1991), pp. 60. See also Suffness. \u201cDevelopment of Antitumor Natural Products at the National Cancer Institute,\u201d Gann Monograph or Cancer Research, 31 (1989) pp. 21-44 (which recommends that Taxol only be given as a 24-hour infusion)., 38768=In a study by Kris et al., Taxol formulated with Cremaphor EL in dehydrated alcohol was given as a 3-hour IV infusion every 21 days, with the administered dosage ranging from 15 to 230 mg/m2 in nine escalation steps. Kris et al. concluded that \u201cwith the severity and unpredictability of the hypersensitivity reactions, further usage of Taxol is not indicated with this drug formulation on this administration schedule.\u201d See Cancer Treat. Rep., Vol. 70, No. 5, May 1986., 57384=The present disclosure demonstrates both of the above-described modes of bioavailability for Taxol (Paclitaxel), an anticancer drug capable of binding to human serum albumin (see, for example, Kumar et al., in Research Communications in Chemical Pathology and Pharmacology 80:337 (1993)). The high concentration of albumin in invention particles, compared to Taxol, provides a significant amount of the drug in the form of molecules bound to albumin, which is also the natural carrier of the drug in the blood stream., 32814=The properties of the polymer solution from which the polymeric matrix is formed are very important to obtain the proper emulsion in the first stage. For example, polylactide (the polymer commonly used in the preparation of injectable nanoparticles), has a surface activity which causes the rapid adsorption thereof at the dichloromethane-water interface, causing reduced interfacial tension (see, for example, Boury et al., in Langmuir 11:1636 (1995)), which in turn improves the emulsification process. In addition, the same researchers found that Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) interacts with the polylactide, and penetrates into the polylactide monolayer present at the oil-water interface. Therefore, it is expected, based on the above reference, that emulsification during the conventional solvent evaporation method is greatly favored by the presence of the surface active polymer (polylactide) in the nonaqueous organic phase. In fact, the presence of polylactide is not only a sufficient condition, but it is actually necessary for the formation of nanoparticles of suitable size., 184549=110 mg butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) is dissolved in 1 ml toluene, and mixed with 2 ml 4:1 solution of Triton X-100:n-Butanol. 32 g of lot casein solution was added, and a microemulsion was spontaneously formed. The microemulsion was evaporated under reduced pressure, 80 mm Hg, at 40\ufffd C., until it became clear. The size of the resulting particles is: Z-average 30 nm, diameter by volume and number distribution is 16 and 15 nm, respectively., 60233=The anticancer agent paclitaxel (TAXOL, Bristol Myers Squibb, BMS,) has remarkable clinical activity in a number of human cancers including cancers of the ovary, breast, lung, esophagus, head and neck region, bladder and lymphomas. It is currently approved for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma where it is used in combination with cisplatin and for metastatic breast cancer that has failed prior treatment with one combination chemotherapy regimen. The major limitation of Taxol is its poor solubility and consequently the BMS formulation contains 50% Cremaphor EL and 50% ethanol as the solubilizing vehicle. Each vial of this formulation contains 30 mg of paclitaxel dissolved at a concentration of 6 mg/ml. Prior to intravenous administration, this formulation must be diluted 1:10 in saline for a final dosing solution containing 0.6 mg/ml of paclitaxel. This formulation has been linked to severe hypersensitivity reactions in animals (Lorenz et al., Agents Actions 1987, 7, 63-67) and humans (Weiss et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 1990, 8, 1263-68) and consequently requires premedication of patients with corticosteroids (dexamethasone) and antihistamines. The large dilution results in large volumes of infusion (typical dose 175 mg/m2) upto 1 liter and infusion times ranging from 3 hours to 24 hours. Thus, there is a need for an alternative less toxic formulation for paclitaxel., 169134=e. Removing the solvent by evaporation at reduced pressure, thus causing precipitation of the drug in the form of extremely small amorphous nanoparticles, having a typical size below 1000 Angstroms. The particles at this stage are dispersed and stabilized in an aqueous medium which contains surfactant, cosurfactant, and optionally protective agents such as proteins, sugars, etc. Acceptable methods of evaporation include the use of rotary evaporators, falling film evaporators, spray dryers, freeze dryers, and other standard evaporation equipment typically used in industry., 40322=Koeller et al., in \u201cA Phase I Pharmacokinetic Study of Taxol Given By a Prolonged Infusion Without Premedication,\u201d Proceedings of ASCO, Vol. 8 (March, 1989), recommends routine premedication in order to avoid the significant number of allergic reactions believed to be caused by the cremophor (polyethoxylated castor oil) vehicle used for Taxol infusions. Patients received dosages ranging from 175 mg/m2 to 275 mg/m2., 48766=In a study by Holmes (Holmes F A, Walters R S, Theriault R L, et al: Phase II trial of Taxol, an active drug in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. J Natl Cancer Inst 83:1797-1805, 1991), and at MSKCC (Reichman B S, Seidman A D, Crown J P A, et al: Paclitaxel and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as initial chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. J Clin Oncol 11:1943-1951, 1993), it was shown that higher doses of TAXOL up to 250 mg/m2 produced greater responses (60%) than the 175 mg/m2 dose (26%) currently approved for TAXOL. These results however, have not been reproduced due to higher toxicity at these higher doses. These studies, however, bear proof to the potential increase in response rate at increased doses of paclitaxel., 53457=In accordance with the present invention, we have discovered that substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agents can be delivered in the form of microparticles or nanoparticles that are suitable for parenteral administration in aqueous suspension. This mode of delivery obviates the necessity for administration of substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agents (e.g., Taxol) in an emulsion containing, for example, ethanol and polyethoxylated castor oil, diluted in normal saline (see, for example, Norton et al., in Abstracts of the 2nd National Cancer Institute Workshop on Taxol & Taxus, Sep. 23-24, 1992). A disadvantage of such known compositions is their propensity to produce allergic side effects., 45320=Higher doses of paclitaxel have also been described in the literature. To determine the maximal-tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel in combination with high-dose cyclophosphamide and cisplatin followed by autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support (AHPCS), Stemmer et al (Stemmer S M, Cagnoni P J, Shpall E J, et al: High-dose paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, and cisplatin with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support: A phase I trial. J Clin Oncol 14:1463-1472, 1996) have conducted a phase I trial in forty-nine patients with poor-prognosis breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or ovarian cancer with escalating doses of paclitaxel infused over 24 hours, followed by cyclophosphamide (5,625 mg/m2) and cisplatin (165 mg/m2) and AHPCS. Dose-limiting toxicity was encountered in two patients at 825 mg/m2 of paclitaxel; one patient died of multi-organ failure and the other developed grade 3 respiratory, CNS, and renal toxicity, which resolved. Grade 3 polyneuropathy and grade 4 CNS toxicity were also observed. The MTD of this combination was determined to be paclitaxel (775 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (5,625 mg/m2), and cisplatin (165 mg/m2) followed by AHPCS. Sensory polyneuropathy and mucositis were prominent toxicities, but both were reversible and tolerable. Eighteen of 33 patients (54%) with breast cancer achieved a partial response. Responses were also observed in patients with NHL (four of five patients) and ovarian cancer (two of two patients)., 26445=Taxol, a naturally occurring diterpenoid, has been shown to have significant antineoplastic and anticancer effects in drug-refractory ovarian cancer. Taxol has shown excellent antitumor activity in a wide variety of tumor models such as the B16 melanoma, L1210 leukemias, MX-1 mammary tumors, and CS-1 colon tumor xenografts. Several recent press releases have termed Taxol as the new anticancer wonder-drug. Indeed, Taxol has recently been approved by the Federal Drug Administration for treatment of ovarian cancer. The poor aqueous solubility of Taxol, however, presents a problem for human administration. Indeed, the delivery of drugs that are inherently insoluble or poorly soluble in an aqueous medium can be seriously impaired if oral delivery is not effective. Accordingly, currently used Taxol formulations require a cremaphor to solubilize the drug. The human clinical dose range is 200-500 mg. This dose is dissolved in a 1:1 solution of ethanol:cremaphor and diluted with saline of about 300-1000 ml of fluid given intravenously. The cremaphor currently used is polyethoxylated castor oil. The presence of cremaphor in this formulation has been linked to severe hypersensitivity reactions in animals (Lorenz et al., Agents Actions 1987, 7, 63-67) and humans (Weiss et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 1990, 8, 1263-68) and consequently requires premedication of patients with corticosteroids (dexamethasone) and antihistamines. The large dilution results in large volumes of infusion (typical dose 175 mg/m2) up to 1 liter and infusion times ranging from 3 hours to 24 hours. Thus, there is a need for an alternative less toxic formulation for paclitaxel., 165728=A microemulsion is a thermodynamically stable emulsion system that is formed spontaneously when all it's components are brought into contact, in the absence of the use of high shear equipment or other substantial agitation. Microemulsions are substantially non-opaque, i.e., they are transparent or translucent. Microemulsions comprise a dispersed phase, in which the typical droplet size is below 1000 Angstrom (\u212b), hence their optical transparency. The droplets in the microemulsion are typically spherical, though other structures such as elongated cylinders are feasible. (For further discussion see, e.g., Rosof, Progress in Surface and Membrane Science, 12,405, Academic Press (1975), Friberg S., Dispersion Science and Technology, 6, 317 (1985).), 185594=30 mg of paclitaxel were dissolved in 2 ml butyl acetate, and added to 4 grams of 4:1 Triton x-100:propylene glycol. 40 ml water were added, and the system was slightly turbid. After evaporation, the system became completely clear. Z-average size was 6 nm, size by volume and numbered distribution was 7-9 nm. The same size was measured after one day at 4\ufffd C., 25778=An example of a water-insoluble drug is Taxol\ufffd, a natural product first isolated from the Pacific Yew tree, Taxus brevifolia, by Wani et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93:2325 (1971)). Among the antimitotic agents, Taxol, which contains a diterpene carbon skeleton, exhibits a unique mode of action on microtubule proteins responsible for the formation of the mitotic spindle. In contrast with other antimitotic agents such as vinblastine or colchicine, which prevent the assembly of tubulin, Taxol is the only plant product known to inhibit the depolymerization process of tubulin, thus preventing the cell replication process., 194030=A suitable composition was found to be as follows: Tween 80 as a surfactant and propylene glycol as a cosurfacant at ratio 1:1. The full phase diagram was evaluated for the system n-butyl acetate, Tween 80: propylene glycol 1:1, water. Two additional solvents were tested: sec-butyl acetate and tert-butyl acetate. The phase diagrams for these systems were the same as for that with n-butyl acetate. The system n-butyl acetate, Tween 80: propylene glycol 1:1, water was evaluated further., 264075=The results indicated that paclitaxel administered in Capxol\u2122 is less toxic than Taxol or the Taxol vehicle thereof administered alone. The LD50 and LD10 for Capxol\u2122 were 447.4 and 371.5 mg/kg of paclitaxel, 7.53 and 5.13 mg/kg of paclitaxel in Taxol, and 1325 and 794 mg/kg of the Taxol vehicle, (corresponds to a dose of 15.06 and 9.06 mg/kg Taxol). In this study, the LD50 for Capxol\u2122 was 59 times greater than Taxol and 29 times greater than the Taxol vehicle alone. The LD10 for paclitaxel in Capxol\u2122 was 72 times greater than paclitaxel in Taxol. Review of all the data in this study suggests that the Taxol vehicle is responsible for much of the toxicity of Taxol. It was seen that the mice receiving Taxol and Taxol vehicle showed classic signs of severe hypersensitivity indicated by bright pink skin coloration shortly after administration. No such reaction was seen for the Capxol\u2122 and Capxol\u2122 vehicle groups. Results are presented in Table 2., 68428=It is also surprising that Capxol, a formulation of the substantially water-insoluble drug, paclitaxel, is stable when reconstituted in an aqueous medium at several different concentrations ranging from, but not limited to 0.1-20 mg/ml. This offers substantial advantage over Taxol during administration of the drug as it results in smaller infusion volumes, overcomes instability issues known for Taxol, such as precipitation, and avoids the use of an in-line filter in the infusion line. Thus Capxol greatly simplifies and improves the administration of paclitaxel to patients., 140447=In this liquid form, other excipients may be dissolved. Such excipients include (but are not limited to) mannitol 0.5-15% lactose 0.1-5%, and maltodextrin. At this stage, the resulting solution of active drug, protein, and excipient can be either spray-dried or lyophilized and milled to yield a dry powder. After spray-drying, the dry particle size is determined by Malvern Mastersizer as D(v.0.5) of about 1-10 \u03bcm. The preferred size range for these particles is 0.5-15 \u03bcm, with a more preferred range of 0.7-8 \u03bcm.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Measurement: The primary outcome will be the tumor response rate (CR/PR) for the enrolled patients. In addition, the time to response, duration of response, and survival time will be monitored. Safety of the treatment will also be evaluated from adverse event rates and changes in standard laboratory parameters. Patients\u2014Phase II Component: Having established the MTD, breast cancer patients similar to those used in the original Paclitaxel trials will be selected for the Phase II component. The number will be based on the desire to establish tumor response rate with acceptable precision at the 95% confidence level. As such, the study will be single armed with the goal of establishing equivalence with standard Paclitaxel by showing that the confidence interval contains the expected response rates for Capxol\u2122. The patient sample size used will be 30 patients, which is common for the Phase II component of a Phase I/II study. Pharmacokinetics: For selected patients, a full pharmacokinetic study will be performed using serum drawn at appropriately designated time points. Parameters such as t1/2 (\u03b1 and \u03b2 phase), AUC, Cmax, Clearance and volume of distribution will be determined. Dosing\u2014Phase I Component: The initial dose to be used in the Phase I component of the trial will be the known maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for Paclitaxel (175 mg/m2). Subsequent doses will be escalated in 25% steps until the MTD is reached. There will be 3",
