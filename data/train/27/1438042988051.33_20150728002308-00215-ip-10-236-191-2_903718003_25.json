    "textAfterTable": "For someone originally from the Indianapolis area, it must be said there are not too many attractions or exotic places to see around the campus or the outside area. The campus is nice and calm although some of the buildings and the dormitory halls could use an update. There are a few places that are unique to the area (IMA, NCAA Hall of Champions, Children's Museum). Am learning a lot For the most part, all of the classes are small enough that the professor knows your name and is able to pay more attention to the needs of the students. Because of this, it is much easier to learn more and to understand the topic without having to rush through anything. As long as you stay focused, I feel that the overall workload will never reach critical mass.
