He moved to Northamptonshire at the end of 2012, attracted by the promise of regular cricket in all formats. It ended his association with Surrey, where he had come up through the Academy system. He played a part in Northamptonshire's 2013 promotion, as well as helping them to win a first trophy in more than 20 years, but was released after the club's disastrous 2014 and decided to call it a day.
