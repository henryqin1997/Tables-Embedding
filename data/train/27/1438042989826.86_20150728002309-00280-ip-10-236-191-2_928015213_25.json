If this is not the case, as in our example, then design parameters must be altered to achieve balance Several things might be done: - lower the resistance in branch 2-b by increasing duct size, or reducing air volume - increase the resistance in branch 1-b by decreasing duct size or increasing air volume Engineering and economic judgment should be used to make this decision; for instance, whether you can use additional air volume or your fan cannot handle the static pressure may dictate the way in which you choose to balance your system. In the example we chose to increase the resistance in branch 1-b to achieve balance. This step may require several trial and error attempts until you become familiar with the process. Continue filling in the work sheet using the governing static pressure column to keep a running total of pressure (note that pressures in series circuits are additive; in parallel circuits they are not). The governing pressure in that branch is used. Finally, as the air exits the exhaust stack of the fan, the velocity pressure of the air is converted back to static pressure and results in the recovery of that energy which is subtracted from",
