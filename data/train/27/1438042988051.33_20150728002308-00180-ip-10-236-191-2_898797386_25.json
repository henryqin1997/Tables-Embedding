            "The only unsafe thing about Fort Lewis campus is the wildlife, but that's what we get for putting a school right next to mountains/forests/wildlife.",
            "There is no Greek/Fraternity/Sorority houses.",
            "Outdoorsy students will LOVE Fort Lewis, it is perfect for cyclists, climbers, runners, any kind of sports lover.",
            "There is many made up holiday's in the town, for excuses to have parties and such. Speaking of parties, there are many around the town at all times of years. The school only breaks for major holidays (good for getting done with school earlier but not so much for breaks).",
            "It is definitely a cheap college EXCEPT for the living expenses. I have not graduated yet so i am not sure if there is more bang for my borrowed buck.",
            "There is usually events EVERY night around campus, from concerts, plays, movies, documentaries, club meetings, contests, discussion functions, Student Council (or senate) meetings. Most of the time there's dorm activities every week and most of the time someone is outside doing something. The town of DURANGO has Movies, a Theatre (plays or musicals), several parks, a river to go tubing down, ski resorts close by, a rather small mall, a great downtown area (shops, coffee, food, bars, dance studios) There is plenty of things to do for a non introverted person from a small town. But if you're a big city person, you will miss it every weekend of your semester here.",
            "The main dining area (the cub) provides food from SODEXO and at first the food seems good (for a kid who almost never has home coked meals). Then you realize that the food sucks, but eating anything (that gives you diarrhea) too much starts to taste bad eventually. BUT, the omelets in the mornings are divine, as soon as possible buy and cook your own food. Also unreasonably priced and meal plan choices are awful. For being such a green/local school, there is a COMPLETE absence of locally grown food/produce.",
            "In every dorm and every college it depends on the dorm and people you are randomly placed with if you have an exceptional experience, and that is just plain luck. Mostly hippie(hipster)/snowboarders/cyclists go to Fort Lewis and the dorms accommodate such with the selections and placements of the dorms. Except.... living off campus costs less (with a couple of friends) then living on campus. UNLESS you pick the cheapest dorm possible.",
            "I feel like the music program is quite rigorous (music student), and they DEFINITELY keep you quite busy if you're a music major. For the more advanced students the individual attention definitely helps to improve your musicianship. If you're looking for more of an advanced challenge, Fort Lewis might not have it for a far advanced student.",
            "If you like individual attention, the outside, and more outside Fort Lewis is for you. Opportunity wise for musicians it is a great starting point, but not much more then that. Theatrical wise the town and surrounding towns are a great opportunity for experience.",
            "Fort Lewis is a college for conversations, a college to discuss ideas. Fort Lewis is a college with a dedicated music program, and in need of funding for the Arts and not JUST Sports. Fort Lewis gives individual attention to students on a regular basis, a great place to start something new, and in need of more teachers."

All levels are welcome. I was always involved in dance when I was little and then it got too expensive. Dance Co-Motion doesn't cost anything but the price of your costume for the show which is fantastic for me! I plan to always be apart of this club. The winter 2012 term was my first time choreographing and it was a great experience that I won't forget. This club helps me fill out my schedule when I need a break from studying, and it helps me stay active rather than sitting around for a study break., 177620=Snowdown a festival in December., 241838=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students There is honestly something for everyone. Tips for prospective students 1. Take advantage of every opportunity that comes your way, you will have a lot of them here. 2. Do your research! Fort Lewis isn't for everyone. Do your research, visit the school and talk to current students to find out if Fort Lewis is the right fit for you. (This is good advice for any school, not just Fort Lewis) Bang for the buck I can't place a value on the tools I have received during my education at Fort Lewis. They really do provide you with everything you need to be successful. If you make use of all of these opportunities you will find that what you get far exceeds the price you pay. Am enjoying being here Durango is a beautiful place! Login to rate or flag the reviews Shannon from Durango, CO 12/10/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 4 out of 5 people found this",
