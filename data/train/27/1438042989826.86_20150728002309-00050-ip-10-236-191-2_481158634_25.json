Columbus, Ohio., 54090=Resole B: 75% by weight solids aqueous dispersion of resole phenolic resin with a formaldehyde/phenol ratio of approximately 2.0/1 and a pH of 8.5 and a viscosity of about 1900 cP at 25\ufffd C. as measured using a Brookfield RV viscometer, being of lower catalyst content than Resole A, available from Georgia-Pacific Resins, Inc. Columbus, Ohio., 36400=There are two basic types of conventional phenolic resins: resole and novolac phenolic resins. Novolac phenolic resins are characterized by being acid catalyzed and having a ratio of formaldehyde to phenol of less than one, typically between 0.5:1 to 0.8:. Acidic catalysts suitable for novolac phenolic resins include sulfuric, hydrochloric, phosphoric, oxalic, and p-toluene sulfonic acids. Novolac phenolic are thermoplastic resins and in the cured form are brittle solids. Novolac phenolic resins are typically reacted with other chemicals to form a crosslinked solid. Resole phenolic resins are characterized by being alkaline catalyzed and having a ratio of formaldehyde to phenol of greater than or equal to one, typically from 1:1 to 3:1. Alkaline catalysts suitable for resole phenolic resins include sodium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, organic amines, or sodium carbonate. Resole phenolic resins are thermosetting resins and in the cured form exhibit excellent toughness, dimensional stability, high strength, hardness, and heat resistance., 43858=The resole phenolic resins used in the invention comprise phenol and formaldehyde. The molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol is greater or equal to 1, typically in the range 1:1 to 3:1. The reaction between the formaldehyde and phenol components is catalyzed by alkaline catalysts such as sodium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, organic amines and sodium carbonate. The coating formulations are generally preferred as aqueous dispersion e.g. 30 to 95% solids, preferably 60 to 80% solids) with the catalyst dissolved in the water. Typically the coating formulations comprise 2% by weight of catalyst., 54452=Resole C: 71% by weight solids aqueous dispersion of resole phenolic resin with a formaldehyde/phenol ratio of approximately 2.0/1, a pH of about 8.5 and a viscosity of about 1400 cP at 25\ufffd C. as measured using a Brookfield RV viscometer, having higher molecular weight than either Resole A and B and containing about 5% by weight of urea, available from Georgia-Pacific Resins, Inc., Columbus, Ohio., 37978=In the production of adhesive coatings for nonwoven abrasive articles, one standard starting phenolic resin composition is a 70% solids condensate of a 1.96:1.0 formaldehyde: phenol mixture with 2% potassium hydroxide catalyst added based on the weight of phenol. The phenolic component of the phenolic resin is typically solid and requires the addition of solvent to render it soluble to react with the formaldehyde. The phenolic resin composition is typically 25 to 28% by weight water and 3 to 5% by weight propylene glycol ether to reduce the viscosity of the resin. Before this resin is used as a make or size coat, (i.e. to make it coatable), further viscosity reduction is often achieved using VOC (i.e. a volatile organic compound). A conventional phenolic resin make coat may contain up to 40% by weight of a VOC, such as isopropyl alcohol to reduce viscosity and make the phenolic compatible with resin modifiers (flexibilizers), while a size coat might contain up to 20% % by weight of a VOC, such as diethylene glycol ethyl ether. Unreacted phenol and formaldehyde in the final, cured resin also contribute to VOC., 46289=Suitable BisP resins are available from Oxychem and bear the CAS number 25085-75-0. The resin formulation generally comprises from 70 to 75% solids of the resin (measured after standing at 135\ufffd C. for three hours) in an aqueous medium and have a viscosity at 25\ufffd C. of 1100 to 1300 cP.}",
