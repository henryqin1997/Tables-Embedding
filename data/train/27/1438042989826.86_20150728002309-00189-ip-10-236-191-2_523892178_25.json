    "textAfterTable": "Final Thoughts A lot has changed in the shopping cart world in the last few years. People are now looking for a shopping cart that is mobile friendly for example, and that ties into a myriad of add-on services like Email marketing, CRM, and Accounting systems. After reviewing the current state of shopping carts we recomend Magento, Open Cart, PrestaShop, and Spree. If you decide to go with an Oscommerce based shopping cart which we would recomend against as it is not well-maintained anymore, we recommend that you start with one of the loaded versions - Zencart, CRE Loaded, or OSCmax - in order to save you lots of money on installing additional modules to the plain Oscommerce version. You can then use your development money to put in your own custom modifications, design, etc. rather than installing all of the basics.
