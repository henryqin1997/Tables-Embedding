Usage Guidelines To use this command, you must be in a user group associated with a task group that includes appropriate task IDs. If the user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for assistance. If the multiplier is changed using the bfd multiplier command, the new parameter is used to update all existing BFD sessions for the protocol (BGP, IS-IS, MPLS-TE, or OSPF).
