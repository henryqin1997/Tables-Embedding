            "Fixed content storage within a partitioned content platform using namespaces - Content platform management is enhanced by logically partitioning a physical cluster that comprises a redundant array of independent nodes. Using an interface, an administrator defines one or more \u201ctenants\u201d within the archive cluster, wherein a tenant has a set of attributes including, for example, namespaces, administrative accounts, data access accounts, and a permission mask. A namespace is a logical partition of the cluster that serves as a collection of objects typically associated with at least one defined application. Each namespace has a private file system such that access to one namespace (and its associated objects) does not enable a user to access objects in another namespace. A namespace has capabilities (e.g., read, write, delete, purge, and the like) that a namespace administrator can choose to enable or disable for a given data account. Using the interface, an administrator for the tenant creates and manages namespaces such that the cluster then is logically partitioned into a set of namespaces, wherein one or more namespaces are associated with a given tenant. This approach enables a user to segregate cluster data into logical partitions. Using the administrative interface, a namespace associated with a given tenant is selectively configured without affecting a configuration of at least one other namespace in the set of namespaces. This architecture enables support for many top level tenants, with multiple namespaces per tenant, and wherein configuration is effected at the level of a namespace.",

Burnham, Nashua, NH US 03-12-2009 Security System for Protecting Construction Site Assets - An apparatus for deterring removal of electrical wiring that is installed in a building includes a controller, and a wiring module responsive to the controller and forming a monitored circuit with installed electrical wiring by coupling to an end of the wiring located at a load distribution junction. The other end of the wiring is electrically coupled, and can be coupled with a controlled impedance, or with a protected asset. The apparatus is configured with control logic to issue an alert if the integrity of the monitored circuit has been compromised. 20090066526 Published Description Patent application number John Allen Burnham, Madison, AL US 07-26-2012 Vertical and horizontal flight aircraft \"Sky Rover\" - Novel aircraft for vertical and horizontal flight having powered air acceleration means installed within its structure drawing air thereinto and delivering the resulting airflow upon airfoils installed in opposed pairs on opposite sides of its exterior structure thereby producing lift without forward travel of the aircraft. 20120187236 Published Description Patent application number J.
