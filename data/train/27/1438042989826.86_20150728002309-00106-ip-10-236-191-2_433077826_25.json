(As far as can be seen, the linguistic approach here is rejected by Siouan grammar books most probably due to the fact that these are the works of linguists rooted in Western concepts of language - are there any Native linguists not raised in English as their first language?, 242853=since December 2003}",

E.g., let's see the following example - now with the use of the enclitic _k'un_ - already introduced above! Here, the topic is translated as a whole sentence (\"you have arrived here\"), hence, in the entire topic-comment structure, it is given as a subordinate clause! \"It is good that you have arrived here!\" -> \"Welcome (here)!\" (s/he or) it is-good/nice [female assertion] !",
