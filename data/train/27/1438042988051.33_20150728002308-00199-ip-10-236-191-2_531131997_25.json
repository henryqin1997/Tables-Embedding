For more information, see the section on Financial Status., 177800=[107] Result of an independent study performed by Just Facts. All data used in the study was obtained from the United States Social Security Administration. Our actual calculations show that the program would have become insolvent in 1977, but because approximations were used in the study, we added an extra 3 years as a margin of safety. The original Social Security Act of 1935 specified different tax rates that were supposed to become effective at certain points in time. Over the course of time, the law was changed. Between 1940 and 1962, the tax rates were lower than the Social Security Act of 1935 originally specified. Since 1963, the tax rates have been higher than originally specified. This study accounts for both of these situations. If the study reflected only the extra taxes paid by the younger generations, the insolvency date would have occurred years earlier. This study did not account for the extra taxes and expenses that have resulted from the government adding disability benefits to the Social Security program. If these numbers were added into the calculation, the insolvency date would have occurred years earlier. This study did not account for extra taxes that have resulted from the government increasing the wage threshold.
