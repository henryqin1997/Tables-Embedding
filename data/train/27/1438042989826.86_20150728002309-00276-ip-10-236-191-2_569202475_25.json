One reason was that as these drugs could pass the blood-brain barrier they would be apt to pass the placental barrier and reach the embryo. Examples of early studies are the McBride study on imipramine and limb defects [3] and the Safra and Oakley study [4] on an association between the use of diazepam and cleft lip/palate. During the following decades the research methodology developed and large studies were made which did not rely on retrospective information on drug use. Much interest has been paid to anticonvulsants which were identified quite early as definite human teratogens [5] and more recently to antidepressant drugs, notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).}",

Table 1 pharmaceuticals-06-01221-t001_Table 1 gives an overview of the number of infants exposed in early pregnancy to drugs in each category. Three groups contain less than 1,000 individuals: drugs for Parkinsonism, psychostimulants, and \u201cother CNS active drugs\u201d. Table 1 2.2. General Information on Use of CNS-Active Drugs in Early Pregnancy During these years, 1,552,382 women gave birth\u201442,881 of them reported the use of at least one of the above-mentioned CNS active drugs in early pregnancy. Among all 1,575,847 infants born, 70,339 had any type of congenital malformation; 49,499 of them were classified as \u201crelatively severe\u201d, 16,145 had any cardiovascular defect, 11,157 of them had a ventricular septum defect (VSD) or an atrial septum defect (ASD), and 4,552 had hypospadias. The odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for a specific malformation after maternal use of a specific drug (group) was estimated with Mantel-Haenszel methodology and the approximate confidence interval with Miettinen\u2019s technique. When the expected number of exposed outcome was less than 10, a relative risk (RR) was calculated instead as the observed over expected number with 95% CI from exact Poisson distributions. In both situations, adjustment was made for year of birth, maternal age (5-year class), parity (1\u20134+), smoking in early pregnancy (unknown, none, <10 cigarettes/day, \u226510 cigarettes per day), and BMI (unknown, <18.5, 18.5\u201324.9, 25\u201329, 9. 30\u201334.9,",
