    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{56074=The water phase in this recipe is composed of deionized water, p(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride), sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, and gelatin. The organic phase is composed of styrene, MMA, allyl methacrylate, and butyl peroctoate. The p(dimethyldiallyammonium chloride) and DI water are charged into a reactor and NaOH and NaCl are added into the mix for pH modification. The target pH is in the range of 9.5-10.5. The oxygen is removed by sweeping nitrogen gas through the reactor and heating the solution to 90\ufffd C. 2.16 g gelatin is dissolved into 144 g DI water at 75\ufffd C. in a separate container with constant agitation until complete dissolution occurs. The gelatin solution is then added into the reactor. The reactor temperature is adjusted to 80\ufffd C. and the monomer mix which is composed of MMA, styrene, allyl methacrylate, and t-butyl peroctoate is charged into the reactor with an agitation of 350 RPM. The reactor is heated gradually to 90\ufffd C. over 2 hrs and polymer conversion is completed in about 4 hrs. Polymer in the form of fine particles is obtained. The crosslinked beads are then centrifuged, washed, and oven dried for extrusion compounding. The resulting particles are highly crosslinked which contain 0.81% ALMA in their composition and have a weight mean size of 35 microns., 42241=The spherical particles may be made by a suspension process wherein the water is a continuous phase serving as a heat transfer medium and the polymerization is carried out in monomer droplets. In a suspension process the viscosity change during the polymer conversion is very small; therefore, the heat transfer is very efficient. The agitation speed, and composition and level of the suspending agent are critical factors in determining the particle size distribution. The typical particle size from suspension is about 10-1000 micrometers. More detailed information about the suspension process can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,580, EP 0,683,182-A2, and EP 0,774,471-A1. Typical examples of using the suspension process for the spherical particles are provided in Examples 1, 2A, 2B, and 2C respectively., 24748=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/116,552, filed Jan. 21, 1999., 37907=The matrix material can be made by many different processes known in the art, including, continuous cell casting, emulsion, suspension, bulk polymerization, and continuous stirred tank reactions(CFSTR), etc. Each of these methods utilize free radical polymerization chemistry. In the continuous cell casting process of acrylic resins, the viscous polymer/monomer mixture, often referred to as syrup and which has about 30-50% polymer conversion, is fed between two stainless steel belts at a controlled temperature. Polymer conversion is completed with the continuous moving belt. In an emulsion process, the major components are monomers, water, emulsifiers, water soluble initiators, and chain transfer agents. The water to monomer ratio is controlled between 70:30 and 40:60. A core/shell particle structure can be achieved through grafting by an emulsion process, which is often a preferred process for making impact modifiers., 50600=TWLT is measured by a Hunterlab colorimeter-D25 model, ASTM: E1331 and E1164. The frosted appearance can be determined by an opacity measurement. The higher the opacity number, the better the hiding power of the thermoplastic sample. To have a frosted appearance, the minimum opacity number should be about 10%. The loading of suspension beads and mismatch of refractive index between beads and matrix material would affect the hiding power of the sample which is measured by the opacity number. The related standard methods for these measurements are ASTM D2805-80, ASTM D589-65, TAPPI T-425, TAPPI T-519., 39909=\u201cHighly crosslinked\u201d means that the particulate material can not be dissolved at all in a strong organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or methylene chloride(MDC). The swell ratio measurement, which measures the particle size change in an organic solvent after a certain period of time, is normally a test method to determine the degree of crosslinking. A low swell ratio, no soluble fraction in a MDC/THF solvent, and the retention of particle integrity are the indications of a highly crosslinked acrylic polymer. The degree of crosslinking can also be monitored through surface hardness and surface gloss measurements. The related test methods are American Standard Test Methods: ASTM D785 and ASTM D2457., 49621=By the term \u201ctextured surface\u201d as used herein is meant a minimum surface roughness of 0.5 um to as high as 30 um or higher. Surface Roughness is determined by a TENCOR Alpha-step 500 surface profiler, the reference method number can be found in ASME: B46.1.1, B46.1.2, B46.1.12, ASME Y14.36. ASME is an abbreviation for the American Society of Mechanic Engineering., 129678=For a sample (at 0.125\u2033 thickness) to have a frosted appearance the Haze number must be at least 90% transmission as determined by ASTM D1003, or at least a 10% opacity as determined by ASTM D2805-80.}",
