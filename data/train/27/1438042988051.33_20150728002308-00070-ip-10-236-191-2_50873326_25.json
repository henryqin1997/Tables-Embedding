The Ravens got a first-and-goal when Broncos cornerback Perrish Cox was flagged for pass interference on a deep attempt to Mason near the end zone., 72870=Flacco capped a nine-play, 73-yard series with a sneak from a yard out for Baltimore's first points, which came with 45 seconds remaining in the first quarter. The Ravens quarterback went 4-for-4 for 51 yards on the march, including a 19-yard delivery to Derek Mason on third down that was followed by a 22-yard strike to tight end Todd Heap that placed the ball on the Broncos' 16-yard line., 74902=A 28-yard pass from Orton to Daniel Graham led to Matt Prater's 38-yard field goal that cut the deficit to 14 points with 11:50 to go, but Baltimore would respond with another long and back-breaking drive to squash any comeback hopes. The Ravens moved 90 yards in 11 plays, with most of the damage again coming on the ground, and claimed a 31-10 lead when McGahee was sprung loose on a block by fullback LeRon McClain and raced 30 yards into the end zone with 5:06 remaining.}",
