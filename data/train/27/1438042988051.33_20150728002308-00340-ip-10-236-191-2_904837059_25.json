            "very different from most campus greek life, hard to explain, but if you attend you'll see.",
            "so many clubs and activities and they're all awesome.",
            "food isn't horrible either, i just think it gets tiring having mostly the same choices after first semester.",
            "not horrible, it's actually pretty decent. my suggestion is not to live in mistletoe till after the dorms have been renovated though.",
            "this is a hardcore math and science school, seriously work at it if you plan to come here.",
            "the course work is very challenging, and if you were one of those kids in high school that got perfect scores doing nothing, expect a reality check. everyone here is pretty interesting and welcoming, and the dorms aren't bad either. good academic assistance, but the weather is bipolar."

There is a pumpkin throwing every Halloween, Homecoming weekend is important, a campus wide service day every September or October, and the cycle club does free bike tune ups every fall, Hudson Relays, Halloween at Home, and study overs to name a few., 16625=This school is great for student who enjoy cold climates. Cleveland receives tons of snow from November to April. Students who are interested in Medicine, Art, Music, and Engineering will find a home at CWRU., 303729=I've only lived in freshman housing and then one of the nicest Greek houses on campus, so I can't speak for the sophomore or upperclassmen housing from experience. However, what I do know is that you are paying a lot of money for some ehhhhhh housing. Freshman dorms were pretty drab. Sophomore housing is in a suite style which is nice, but the singles are horrifically small and cramped. Maintenance is pretty unreliable; I had a friend whose heat went out in January, and it took two maintenance requests, two phone calls, and finally a visit to undergraduate services to have something done about it. And if you know anything about winter in Cleveland, you don't want your heat out for ten minutes, let alone three days. However, DON'T take that as a reason not to come here or to live on campus. The way the dorms are laid out makes it so easy to socialize with friends, especially in your first year. Laundry is FREE!!! Overall a positive experience that I have loved, especially being in my Greek house. Be sure to bundle up in the winter because it is about a 15 minute walk to the main quad from north side and 10 minutes from south side.}",

Tips for prospective students Make a list of what you look for in a school. The weather in Cleveland is very cold and windy during the winter which can make it difficult to motivate yourself to go to class at times. The education is great but the social life can be slower than a lot of other schools as a result of the workload. Bang for the buck My financial aid package was much better than what other schools were offering me. They do their best to make it as affordable as possible. The education is one of the best and there are opportunities everywhere. Am enjoying being here I have met many people with the same interests as me both academically",
