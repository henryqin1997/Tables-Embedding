    "textBeforeTable": "Both dial-up and leased-line links involve two peers that are connected by a communications medium. The next table summarizes the differences between the link types. Comparison of Dial-up and Leased-Line Links A hardwired, leased-line PPP configuration involves two peers that are connected by a link. This link consists of a switched or an unswitched digital service leased from a provider. Solaris PPP 4.0 works over any full-duplex, point-to-point leased-line medium. Typically, a company rents a hardwired link from a network provider to connect to an ISP or other remote site. Leased-Line PPP Overview The dial-out machine can then run telnet or a similar command to a host that is reachable through the dial-in server. PPP's Network Control Protocols (NCPs) negotiate the use of network protocols, such as IPv4 or IPv6. If necessary, the peers authenticate each other. PPP on both peers enters Establish phase, where Link Control Protocol (LCP) negotiates basic link parameters and the use of authentication. When modem-to-modem negotiation is completed, the modem on the dial-out machine reports \u201cCONNECT.\u201d Modem attached to the dial-in server begins link negotiation with the modem on the dial-out machine. Modem dials the phone number to establish a telephone connection with the modem on the dial-in server. The series of text strings that the dial-out machine sends to the modem and dial-in",

Each peer might be a workstation or server. Often the peer functions as a router between its network or the Internet, and the opposite peer. Synchronous interface on each peer. Some machines that run Solaris software require you to purchase a synchronous interface card, such as HSI/P, to connect to a leased line. Other machines, such as UltraSPARC\u00ae workstations, have built-in synchronous interfaces. CSU/DSU synchronous digital unit on each peer, which connects the synchronous port to the leased line. A CSU might be built-in to the DSU, or owned by you, or leased from a provider, depending on your locale. The DSU gives the Solaris machine a standard synchronous serial interface. With Frame Relay, the Frame Relay Access Device (FRAD) performs the serial interface adaptation. Leased line, providing switched or unswitched digital services. Some examples are SONET/SDH, Frame Relay PVC, and T1. What Happens During Leased-Line Communications On most types of leased lines, peers do not actually dial each other. Rather, a company purchases a leased-line service to connect explicitly between two fixed locations. Sometimes the two peers at either end of the leased line are at different physical locations of the same company. Another scenario is a",
