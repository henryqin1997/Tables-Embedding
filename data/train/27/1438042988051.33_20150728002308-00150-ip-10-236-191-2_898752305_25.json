            "iowa state campus unique. unlike many other large schools, isu campus has its separate area within the town of ames. the campus is confined and extremely safe for walkers, joggers, and bikers and anytime of day. there are many light posts that light up each and every sidewalk throughout campus. isu also has the convenience of the help van. this is a service from the isu police and this number should be programmed into every students phone. at any time, if you have any problem, call help van! they have vans circling campus all the time to pick you up and give you a lift.",
            "the greek life at iowa state is very large. there are many fraternities and sororities to join. some focus primarily on academics, while others specialize in volunteer work and giving back to our community. greek life is another fabulous way to get involved in exciting opportunities at isu and meet more wonderful people.",
            "iowa state has thousands of clubs. each year they come together to host club fest. all students are invited free of charge to come see what each club has to offer. you can visit each club's booth, pick up any brochures with further information, and possibly snag some free gifts! club fest always opens my eyes to many new clubs that i hadn't thought existed. its an opportunity to try new things and meet more awesome people.",
            "there are activities on campus for everyone and anyone! if you are worried you will not fit in, worry no more. there is a niche here for you!",
            "the campus has many fun traditions. the campus is known for its large campanile tower that sounds bells on the hour and plays popular songs during celebrations. campaniling is a special tradition on campus that consists of taking your loved one to kiss under the campanile. this deems you a 'true iowa stater.' there is also the zodiac imprinted onto the lobby floor of the memorial union. the tradition is to walk around it and never across it, for superstition that you may fail your next exam. lastly, the swans of lake laverne are a must see at isu! their names are lancelot and elaine, and they are very used to the students on campus.",
            "i am from out of state, and hesitated to leave home, but i could not be any happier with my decision to come to isu.",
            "join one of the thousands of clubs put together by students at isu! there is a club for anything that interests you! and, in the off chance that there is not, you can start your own! intramural sports are also extremely popular on campus. win a free t-shirt in the championship! iowa state also provides free late night activities, such as; bingo, bowling, crafts, and free movies!",
            "the food quality on campus is amazing. there are many restaurants and convenience stores (c-stores) located throughout campus. most food can be purchased using dining dollars that can be added to your isu card, so that you do not need to bring money to campus. our udcc dining hall is a must see! also, stop in to the hub and caribou coffee on central campus for a great lunch or study spot!",
            "the dorm life at isu is a great place for incoming freshmen to meet new people and take part in all the campus activities. many students choose to stay in dorms throughout their sophomore, junior and sometimes senior year.",
            "the programs at isu are top of the line. while many of the courses may be rigorous, the professors and staff truly care about your learning experience. they make time to meet with you when you need further help. the college also provides many opportunities to help your education, such as; tutor services, review sessions, and supplemental instruction.",
            "as a prospective student, i would suggest touring the campus! it is absolutely gorgeous. don't be afraid to ask anyone (especially students) questions about isu. also, attend an isu sporting event or performance while in town. you can only truly understand hilton magic, or the power of the jack trice stadium if you participate!",
            "iowa state university has exceeded my expectations in many ways. they have proven to have top notch professors who are willing to take time out of their lives to help students learn. the campus is inviting, and the students come together to make isu feel like a family!"

Over 1000 students and a great place to meet great friends and people who truly care. Plus its a campus organization too!, 150980=Dorms are pretty typical. Iowa State is a large campus with lots of housing,they are building a new dorm that should be done by 2017. You can go for traditional housing or suite style, lots of variety but apply early!:), 192522=I'm am loving the campus! I'm starting as a Freshman this August 2011. Though I haven't started, students there for summer classes were helpful and informative, as were the professors at orientation. I can't Wait to attend!, 881032=By the fall of 2014, Iowa State University will officially have the biggest Greek system in the United States.

The application opens up in July,make sure you accept your offer of admission and correctly put in data directly from transcript. Also housing fills up quick if you want to live in a specific dorm submit your housing contract ASAP.

There's a group for everyone!:), 532851=Voed most interactive greek community in 2010, and 2011 this is due to the large number of participants as well as the many opportunities for paired events with the option to lead if you have the talents to do so.}",

The professors are true experts in their fields, and do an excellent job teaching. The living experience at ISU leads to a lot of great insights too, especially if you're living in Friley or Helser Halls.
