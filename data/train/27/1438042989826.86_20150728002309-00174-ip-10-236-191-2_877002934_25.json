For each physical quantity, a number of different units (some only of historical interest) are shown and expressed in terms of the corresponding SI unit. Tables of conversion factors[edit] Within each table, the units are listed alphabetically, and the SI units (base or derived) are highlighted. Table ordering[edit] Conversion between units in the metric system can be discerned by their prefixes (for example, 1 kilogram = 1000\u00a0grams, 1 milligram = 0.001\u00a0grams) and are thus not listed in this article. Exceptions are made if the unit is commonly known by another name (for example, 1 micron = 10\u22126 metre). Multiplication factors[edit] By contrast, a hard conversion or an adaptive conversion may not be exactly equivalent. It changes the measurement to convenient and workable numbers and units in the new system. It sometimes involves a slightly different configuration, or size substitution, of the item. Nominal values are sometimes allowed and used. Some conversions from one system of units to another need to be exact, without increasing or decreasing the precision of the first measurement. This is sometimes called soft conversion. It does not involve",
