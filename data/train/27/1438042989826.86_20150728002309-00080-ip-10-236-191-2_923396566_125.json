            "Physics department is worse. There is a professor who is suffering form cancers for several years that is what he tells to everybody to get sympathy and help from people. He never come to work because of his sickness but actually he does not want to work. He spent time at home with his wife. His job is tenured and so he think he does not need to work any more. Stay away from him, he manipulate words very quickly and can easily put you in a trap to give you trouble. He is a kind of psycho patient, stay away from him. He is a liar. He is actually a Muslim. He did his PhD from a Muslim university, but he does not write the full name of that university in his CV to hide that information. He spend several years in middle east before coming to USA. He is basically ruining the department. He publish all his paper in Journal of applied Physics through one conference proceedings which held every year in, he claims that these are regular peer reviewed paper. He is a cheater don't believe him.",
