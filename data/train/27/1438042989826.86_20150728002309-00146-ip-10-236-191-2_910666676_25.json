    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Clark, like many colleges these days, is very expensive. It does offer very good financial aid, but it's still pricy. My academic education has been mentally fulfilling, so the cost of classes makes sense. My dorm room is much bigger than I thought it would be and has more than enough room for me and my roommate to live in. The dining plan could use a revision but the food is always homemade and almost always good. I feel like I'm getting my money's worth but it would be great for Clark to be a little less expensive. Am enjoying being here I love Clark. I know this sounds cliche but I honestly can't see myself anywhere else. Clark is kind of an unknown little school so it was serendipitous that I even applied. Many of my other friends are unhappy at college, all based on different factors, and I feel truly blessed to have found such a great match. I felt at home here after only one day, and feel like I've lived here at least a year already when in reality, it's only been a semester. The people at Clark have really made it my home. I have such great friends that inspire me to challenge myself everyday. Am learning a lot",
