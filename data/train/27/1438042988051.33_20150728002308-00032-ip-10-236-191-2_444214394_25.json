Based on data from the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy for 2008, the overall oil share of the domestic economy is set to 4.2 percent, with one-third of total oil usage accounted for by households, and two-thirds by firms. The oil imports of the home country are set to 70 percent of total demand in the steady state, implying that one third of oil demand is satisfied by domestic production. This estimate is based on 2008 data from the National Income and Product Accounts. In the foreign block, the overall oil share is set to 8.2 percent. The oil endowment abroad is 9.5 percent of foreign GDP, based on oil supply data from the Energy Information Administration., 2068=Beginning in 2009, in many advanced economies, policy rates reached their zero lower bound (ZLB). Almost at the same time, oil prices started rising again. We analyze how the ZLB affects the propagation of oil shocks. As these shocks move inflation and output in opposite directions, their effects on economic activity are cushioned when monetary policy is constrained. The burst of inflation from an oil price increase lowers real interest rates at the ZLB and stimulates the interest-sensitive component of GDP, offsetting the usual contractionary effects. In fact, if the increase in oil prices is gradual, the persistent rise in inflation can cause a GDP expansion., 82831=Jaimovich, N. and S. Rebelo (2009, September).

Beginning in 2009, there has been another important systematic change in monetary policy. Namely, in many advanced economies, policy rates reached their zero lower bound (ZLB) inhibiting their stabilization role. At the same time, the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude doubled from a trough of a little less than $40 per barrel in February of 2009 to a peak of $80 in July 2010. In light of these events, we address how the zero lower bound constraint on policy rates affects the transmission of oil shocks on the macroeconomy., 84127=Smets, F. and R. Wouters (2003).

Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking 35, 1119-1198., 3038=An important, ongoing debate in macroeconomics concerns the influence of oil shocks on aggregate activity. One view is that oil shocks are a principal source of business cycle fluctuations. In this vein, Hamilton (2009) argued that most of the global recession that began in 2008 reflects the preceding run-up in oil prices. In contrast, Blanchard and Gal\u00ed (2007) attributed a small role to oil shocks as drivers of economic fluctuations in the 1980s and 1990s, and suggested an even smaller role in more recent years., 82292=Hamilton, J.
