    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students This school is 2nd only to Juliard for dance, musical theatre and acting majors. It is a top notch university and has seen many students go onto big-time careers at different places of employment within their respective field. The school is also great for students wishing to major in cinema, digital media and the like. And it is almost a necessity that you like the city scene, as you are smack dab in the hustle and bustle of downtown Pittsburgh. Tips for prospective students Get accustomed to using elevators, as this is an urban campus which means the buildings are tall and skinny with many floors. Sometimes it takes 10 minutes to get to the first floor from my room on the 16th due to the high traffic and various stops it has to make along the way. Also, familiarize yourself with the general area around the school so that when you have free time you are able to do what and go where you want. Bang for the buck As far as value for your dollar, there are a ton of things that it buys you. Shuttles to Oakland where the Pittsburgh Playhouse is located, a site where any Point Park student can see shows for free.",
