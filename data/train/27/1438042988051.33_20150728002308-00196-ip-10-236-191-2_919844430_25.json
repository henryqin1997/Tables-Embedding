The regulations revised the pro forma Small Generator Interconnection Procedures (SGIP) and pro forma Small Generator Interconnection Agreement (SGIA) originally set forth in Order No. 2006., 86138=The Commission is revising its regulations pursuant to section 220 of the Federal Power Act (FPA), as enacted by section 1281 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), to facilitate price transparency in markets for the sale and transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce. In doing so, the Commission revises its regulations to require market participants that are excluded from the Commission's jurisdiction under FPA section 205 and have more than a de minimis market presence to file Electric Quarterly Reports (EQR) with the Commission. In addition, the Commission revises the existing EQR filing requirements applicable to market participants in the interstate wholesale electric markets by adding new fields for: reporting the trade date and the type of rate; identifying the exchange used for a sales transaction, if applicable; reporting whether a broker was used to consummate a transaction; reporting electronic tag (e-Tag) ID data; and reporting standardized prices and quantities for energy, capacity and booked out power transactions. The Commission also requires EQR filers to indicate in the existing ID data section whether they report their sales transactions to an index publisher and, if so, to which index publisher(s), and, if applicable, identify which types of transactions are reported. The Commission also eliminates the time zone from the contract section and the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) data requirement. These refinements to the existing EQR filing requirements reflect the evolving nature of interstate wholesale electric markets, will increase market transparency for the Commission and the public, and will allow market participants to file the information in the most efficient manner possible., 117756=\u00a7 2626 - Reports respecting standards, 118648=\u00a7 2644 - Relationship to other authority, 118436=\u00a7 2642 - Responsibilities of Secretary, 110271=\u00a7 819 - Repealed.

In this final rule, the Commission is revising its rules and regulations relating to the filing of privileged material in keeping with the Commission's efforts to comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act and the E-Government Act of 2002., 117135=\u00a7 2613 - Federal contracts, 117056=\u00a7 2612 - Coverage, 117365=\u00a7 2622 - Obligations to consider and determine, 18409=This notice contains corrections to the order (RM01-8-000, et al) which was published in the Federal Register of Friday, March 14, 2014 (79 FR 14369). This order updated the EQR Data Dictionary to indicate how market participants should enter information in certain fields of the new EQR system so that the new system's validation process will more readily accept filings. These updates to the EQR Data Dictionary enable the implementation of the Commission's revised EQR filing process. This order also updated the EQR Data Dictionary's list of Balancing Authority names and abbreviations to reflect changes in the official source of such data., 74351=In this Final Rule, the Commission revises its rules and regulations relating to the filing of privileged material in keeping with the Commission's efforts to comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act and the E-Government Act of 2002. First, the Commission establishes two categories of privileged material for filing purposes: Privileged material and critical energy infrastructure information. This revision will expand the ability to file electronically by permitting electronic filing of materials subject to Administrative Law Judge protective orders as appropriate. Second, the Commission revises its regulations to provide a single set of uniform procedures for filing privileged materials. These revisions continue the Commission's effort to reassess and streamline its regulations to ensure that they are efficient, effective and up to date. Also, the Commission revises Rule 213(d) of its Rules of Practice and Procedure, which establishes the timeline for filing answers to motions, to clarify that the standard fifteen day reply time will not apply to motions requesting an extension of time or a shortened time period for action. Instead, the Commission proposes to set the time for responding to such motions at five days, unless another time period is established by notice based on the circumstances., 117855=\u00a7 2627 - Relationship to State law, 118750=\u00a7 2645 - Utility regulatory institute, 48281=The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is making available on its Web site ( http://www.ferc.gov ), Extensible Mark-Up Language (XML) needed to make Electric Quarterly Report (EQR) filings with one of the new filing processes adopted in Order No. 770, in the Commission's Final Rule, 77 FR 71288 (November 30, 2012).

This order affirms the Order No. 1000 transmission planning reforms that: Require that each public utility transmission provider participate in a regional transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan; provide that local and regional transmission planning processes must provide an opportunity to identify and evaluate transmission needs driven by public policy requirements established by state or federal laws or regulations; improve coordination between neighboring transmission planning regions for new interregional transmission facilities; and remove from Commission-approved tariffs and agreements a federal right of first refusal. This order also affirms the Order No. 1000 requirements that each public utility transmission provider must participate in a regional transmission planning process that has: A regional cost allocation method for the cost of new transmission facilities selected in a regional transmission plan for purposes of cost allocation and an interregional cost allocation method for the cost of new transmission facilities that are located in two neighboring transmission planning regions and are jointly evaluated by the two regions in the interregional transmission coordination process required by this Final Rule. Additionally, this order affirms the Order No. 1000 requirement that each cost allocation method must satisfy six cost allocation principles., 118345=\u00a7 2641 - Voluntary guidelines, 118143=\u00a7 2633 - Judicial review and enforcement, 117951=\u00a7 2631 - Intervention in proceedings, 80027=The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission affirms its basic determinations in Order Nos. 1000 and 1000-A, amending the transmission planning and cost allocation requirements established in Order No. 890 to ensure that Commission-jurisdictional services are provided at just and reasonable rates and on a basis that is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.

Additionally, this order affirms the Order No. 1000 requirement that each cost allocation method must satisfy six cost allocation principles., 58558=The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) amends its regulations to change the process for filing Electric Quarterly Reports (EQR). Due to technology changes that will render the current filing process outmoded, ineffective, and unsustainable, the Commission will discontinue the use of Commission-distributed software to file an EQR. Instead, the Commission adopts a web-based approach to filing EQRs that will allow a public or non-public utility to file an EQR directly through the Commission's Web site, either through a web interface or by submitting an Extensible Mark-Up Language-formatted file. By adopting a process with two options for filing EQRs, the Commission seeks to provide the flexibility needed to accommodate a public or non-public utility's technical preference. The Commission also requires a public or non-public utility to identify itself with a company identification number rather than the existing software-based EQR identifier. The changes to the process for filing EQRs will apply to EQR filings beginning with the third quarter 2013 EQR, which will provide data for July through September 2013., 116977=\u00a7 2611 - Purposes, 118049=\u00a7 2632 - Consumer representation, 116794=\u00a7 2602 - Definitions, 105929=\u00a7 791 - Repealed.

This rule will become effective June 30, 2015. 18 CFR Part 35 Summary In this Final Rule, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is amending its regulations to waive the Open Access Transmission Tariff requirements, the Open Access Same-Time Information System requirements, and the Standards of Conduct requirements, under certain conditions, for the ownership, control, or operation of Interconnection Customer's Interconnection Facilities (ICIF). This Final Rule finds that those seeking interconnection and transmission service over ICIF that are subject to the blanket waiver adopted herein may follow procedures applicable to requests for interconnection and transmission service under sections 210, 211, and 212 of the FPA, which also allows the contractual flexibility for entities to reach mutually agreeable access solutions. This Final Rule establishes a modified rebuttable presumption for a five-year safe harbor period to reduce risks to ICIF owners eligible for the blanket waiver during the critical early years of their projects. Finally, this Final Rule modifies, as described in detail below, several elements of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, including the entities eligible for the OATT waiver, the date on which the safe harbor begins, the rebuttable presumption that the ICIF owner should not be required to expand its facilities during the safe harbor, and the facilities",
