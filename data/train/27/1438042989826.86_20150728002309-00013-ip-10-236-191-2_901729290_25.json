Any student wiling to work. Any student who doesn't know exactly what their major is just yet, but wants to feel around and figure out what is best for them. Tips for prospective students Try to earn as many outside scholarships as possible. Always be friendly to the staff, and try to get to know them as well. They can help when problems come up.
