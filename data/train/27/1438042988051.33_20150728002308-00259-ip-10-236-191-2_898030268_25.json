The college and students arrange activities like ultimate frisbee tournaments, mud volleyball tournaments, other competitions and rent blow-up bouncers of all kinds. The foodservice is an outdoor barbecue and everyone has a great time all day. The Mall is the main vein of the college - it is a brick walkway that used to be the continuation of Fifth Street.

It is a very competitive school though, if your just going to school for fun it might be challenging. If you are someone who did have a lot of trouble in high school there are programs to help you though and lots of people attend them so you don't need to worry about feeling dumb for being tutored. Tips for prospective students Go on a overnight visit if you can, that's pretty much how I made my decision. Bang for the buck It's a little expensive but you get a lot here. Like free laundry! All events are free to students too. They offer students a lot. All campus is wi-fi. Am enjoying being here I love it here. The student body is so",
