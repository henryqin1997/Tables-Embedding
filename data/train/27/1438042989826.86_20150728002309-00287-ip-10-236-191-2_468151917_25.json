The clock rate is 2 MHz. The beam-former creates 120 beams and the raw digital data (underwater acoustic signal) from each beam Using Digital Potentiometers to Design Low-Pass Adjustable Filters The most common filter found in a data acquisition system signal path is a low-pass filter. This type of filter is usually used to reduce A/D Converter (ADC) aliasing errors. If there is more than one signal that is applied to the A/D converter through a multiplexer, each signal source may have its Bridge Sensing with the MCP6S2X PGAs Resistive sensors configured as Wheatstone bridges are primarily used to sense pressure, temperature or loads. An external A/D converter (ADC) and a digitally Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) can easily be used to convert the difference voltage from these resistor bridge sensors to usable digital Sensing Light with a Programmable Gain Amplifier of the PGA / Analog-to- Digital (A/D) conversion allows the photo sensor input signal to",
