Authenticode provides users with the assurance of accountability and authenticity for software downloaded over the Internet. The proposal went public in April 1996 [MS96], and the system was available in Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 in October 1996. Authenticode uses PKCS#7 [RSA97] and X.509 as the metadata format, X.509 as the trust protocol, a graphical interface to specify user policies and an implicit, non-extensible execution environment to evaluate user policies and run trust protocols. Below is a graphical representation of Authenticode in the trust management infrastructure., 178603=[EFRT97] Ellison, C., Frantz, B., Rivest., and Thomas, B.

The returned statements simply adds the Label Endorser module's identifier in the statement context and the auditor's name in the statement content on top of the endorsed statement. For example, if an auditor \"GoodMouseClicking@w3.org\" endorses the rater \"mstrauss@research.att.com\" from the above statement, the new statement becomes unknown if the input statement-list contains no PICS label to be endorsed, and true if any label in a statement-list is endorsed, The returned tri-value is  is a REFEREE module that handles requests for deferral of trust. The module takes three arguments, the name of the auditor, a list of label bureaus, and a statement-list to be endorsed. For each label (represented as a statement) in the statement-list, the module requests additional labels to vouch for the label author",

Endorse-label module vouches for labels with raters endorsed by a named auditor. The exact behaviors of the three modules are explained in Section 5.3.
