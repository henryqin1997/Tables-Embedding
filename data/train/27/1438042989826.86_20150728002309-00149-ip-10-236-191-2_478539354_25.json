    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{37959=The memory bit transistor's gate terminal connects to a wordline (towline) 16. The wordline, which connects to a multitude of memory bits, consists of an extended segment of the same polysilicon used to form the transistor's gate. The wordline is physically orthogonal to the digitline. A memory array, shown in FIG. 2, is created by tiling a selected quantity of memory bits together such that memory bits along a given digitline do not share a common wordline and such that memory bits along a common wordline do not share a common digitline. FIG. 3 contains an example of a memory array formed by tiling memory bits. There are several features of this layout that need illumination. First, note that the memory bits are in pairs to permit the sharing of a common contact to the digitline. This feature reduces the array size by eliminating unnecessary duplication. Second, note that any given wordline only forms (crosses) a memory bit transistor on alternating digitlines. This feature allows the formation of digitline pairs and ensures that wordline activation enables transistors only on alternate digitlines. Digitline pairs are an inherent feature in folded digitline arrays, as depicted in FIG. 3. An alternate array structure called open digitline architecture can also be used. A thorough understanding of both folded and open architectures by those skilled in the art assists in appreciating the characteristics and benefits of the bi-level digitline of the present invention. The open digitline and folded digitline architectures both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. While open digitline architectures achieve smaller array layouts by virtue of using smaller 6F2 memory bit cells, they also suffer from poor noise performance. A relaxed wordline pitch which stems from the 6F2 memory bit simplifies the task of wordline driver layout. Sense amplifier layout, though, is difficult because the array configuration is inherently half pitch\u2014one sense amplifier for every two digitlines. Folded digitline architectures, on the other hand, have superior signal to noise, at the expense of larger, less efficient array layout. Good signal to noise performance stems from the adjacency of true and complement digitlines and the capability to twist these digitline pairs. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,107,459 to Chu et al., issued Apr. 21, 1992 describes a stacked digitline architecture which uses lateral and vertical twisting. This technique, however, allows differential noise to be experienced on the digitlines which creates difficulty for differential sense amplifiers. Sense amplifier layout in the folded digitline architecture is simplified because the array configuration is quarter pitch\u2014one sense amplifier for every four digitlines. Wordline driver layout is more difficult since the wordline pitch is effectively reduced in folded architectures., 155265=The 32 Mbit array block shown in FIG. 40 includes size estimates for the various pitch cells. Layout was generated where necessary to arrive at the size estimates. Overall size for the folded digitline 32 Mbit block can be found by again summing the dimensions for each component. Accordingly, Height32=(Tr\ufffdHrdec)+(Tdl\ufffdPdl) microns, where Tr is the number of row decoders, Hrdec is the height of each decoder, Tdl is the number of digitlines including redundant and dummy, and Pdl is the digitline pitch. Similarly, Width32=(Tsa\ufffdWamp)+(Twl\ufffdPwl8)+(Ttwist\ufffdWtwist) microns, where Tsa is the number of sense amplifier strips, Wamp is the width of the sense amplifiers, Twl is the total number of wordlines including redundant and dummy, Pwl8 is the wordline pitch for the 8F2 memory bit, Ttwist is the total number of twist regions, and Wtwist is the width of the twist regions. Table 9 shows the calculated results for the 32 Mbit block shown in FIG. 40. This table assumes the use of a double metal process necessitating the use of local row decoder blocks. Note that Table 9 contains approximately twice as many wordlines as Table 5 for the open digitline architecture. The reason for this is that each wordline in the folded array only connects to memory bits on alternating digitlines, whereas each wordline in the open array connects to memory bits on every digitline. A folded digitline design therefore needs twice as many wordlines as a comparable open digitline design., 180661=A variety of vertical twisting schemes is possible with the bilevel digitline architecture. As shown in FIGS. 44A-C, each scheme utilizes conductive layers already present in the DRAM process to complete the twist. Vertical twisting is simplified since only half of the digitlines are involved in a given twist region. The final selection of a twisting scheme is based upon available process technology, yield factors and die size consideration., 143396=Folded Array Architecture. The folded array architecture depicted in FIG. 39 is the standard architecture used in today's modern DRAM designs. The folded architecture is constructed with multiple array cores separated by strips of sense amplifiers and either row decode blocks or wordline stitching regions. Unlike the open digitline architecture, which uses 6F2 memory bit cell pairs, the folded array core uses 8F2 memory bit cell pairs. Modern array cores include 262,144 (218) functionally addressable memory bits arranged in 532 rows and 1044 digitlines. The 532 rows consists of 512 actual wordlines, 4 redundant wordlines and 16 dummy wordlines. Each row (wordline) connects to memory bit transistors on alternating digitlines. The 1044 digitlines consist of 1024 actual digitlines (512 columns), 16 redundant digitlines (8 columns) and 4 dummy digitlines. As discussed earlier, photolithography limitations necessitate the use of the dummy wordlines and digitlines. These photo problems are very pronounced at the edges of large repetitive structures such as the array core., 35591=This application is a continuation of Application Ser. No. 09/826,764, filed Apr. 5, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,392,303 B2, issued May 21, 2002, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/507,170, filed Feb. 18, 2000, now U.S. Pat.

This application claims priority to provisional application serial Nos. 60/010,293 filed Feb. 1, 1996, and 60/010,622 filed Jan. 26, 1996, both entitled A NOVEL ARCHITECTURE FOR ADVANCED HIGH DENSITY DYNAMIC RANDON ACCESS MEMORIES., 223076=From Table 16 it can be concluded that overall die size (32 Mbit Area) is a better metric for comparison than array efficiency. For instance, the triple metal folded digitline design using hierarchical row decodes has an area of 34,089,440 \u03bcm2 and an efficiency of 70.9%. The triple metal bilevel digitline design with local row decodes has an efficiency of only 63.1%, but an overall area of 28,732,296\u03bcm2. Array efficiency for the folded digitline is higher, but this is misleading, since the folded digitline yields a die that is 18.6% larger for the same number of conductors. Table 16 also illustrates that the bilevel digitline architecture always yields that smallest die area, regardless of the configuration. The smallest folded digitline design at 32,654,1604 \u03bcm2 and the smallest open digitline design at 29,944,350 \u03bcm2 are still larger than the largest bilevel digitline design at 28,732,296 \u03bcm2. Also apparent is that the bilevel and open digitline architectures both need at least three conductors in their construction. The folded digitline architecture still has a viable design option using only two conductors. The penalty to two conductors is, of course, a much larger die size\u2014a full 41% larger than the triple metal bilevel digitline design., 119723=Layout was generated for the various 32 Mbit elements depicted in FIG. 36 using commercial IC layout software. This layout is necessary to obtain reasonable estimates for pitch cell size. These size estimates, in turn, allow overall dimensions of the 32 Mbit memory block to be calculated. The results of these estimates appear in FIG. 36. Essentially, the overall height of the 32 Mbit block can be found by summing the height of the row decode blocks (or stitch regions) together with the product of wordline pitch and total number of wordlines. Accordingly, Height32=(Tr\ufffdHldec)+(Tdl\ufffdPdl) microns, where Tr is the number of local row decoders, Hldec is the height of each decoder, Tdl is the number of wordlines including redundant and dummy lines, and Pdl is the digitline pitch. Similarly, the width of the 32 Mbit block is found by summing the total width of the sense amplifier blocks together with the product of the wordline pitch and the number of wordlines. This bit of math yields Width32=(Tsa\ufffdWamp)+(Twl\ufffdPwl6) microns, where Tsa is the number of sense amplifier strips, Wamp is the width of the sense amplifiers, Twl is the total number of wordlines including redundant and dummy lines, and Pwl6 is the wordline pitch for the 6F2 memory bit. Table 5 contains calculation results for the 32 Mbit block shown in FIG. 36. While overall size is the best measure of architectural efficiency, a second popular metric is array efficiency. Array efficiency is determined by dividing the area consumed by functionally addressable memory bits by the total die area. To simplify the analysis, peripheral circuits will be ignored in the array efficiency calculation. Rather, the array efficiency calculation will only consider the 32 Mbit memory block, ignoring all other factors. With this simplification, the array efficiency for a 32 Mbit block is given as Efficiency=(100\ufffd225\ufffdPdl\ufffdPwl6)\ufffd(Area32) percent, where 225 is the number of addressable memory bits in each 32 Mbit block. The open digitline architecture yields a calculated array efficiency of 51.7 percent., 195850=The 32 Mbit array block shown in FIG. 47 includes pitch cell layout estimates. Overall size for the 32 Mbit block is found by summing the dimensions for each component. As before, Height32=(Tr\ufffdHrdec)+(Tdl\ufffdPdl) microns where Tr is the number of bilevel row decoders, Hrdec is the height of each decoder, Tdl is the number of bilevel digitline pairs including redundant and dummy, and Pdl is the digitline pitch. Also, Width32=(Tsa\ufffdWamp)+(Twl\ufffdPwl6)+(Ttwist\ufffdWtwist) microns, where Tsa is the number of sense amplifier strips, Wamp is the width of the sense amplifiers, Twl is the total number of wordlines including redundant and dummy, Pwl6 is the wordline pitch for the plaid 6F2 memory bit, Ttwist is the total number of twist regions, and Wtwist is the width of the twist regions. Table 13 shows the calculated results for the bilevel 32 Mbit block shown in FIG. 47. A triple metal process is assumed in these calculations since it requires the use of local row decoders. Array efficiency for the bilevel digitline 32 Mbit array block is given as Efficiency=(100\ufffd225\ufffdPdl\ufffd2\ufffdPwl6)\ufffd(Area32) percent, which yields 63.1 percent for this design example., 152729=Similar to the open digitline architecture, digitline length for the folded digitline architecture is again limited by power dissipation and minimum cell to digitline capacitance ratio. For the 256 Mbit generation, digitlines are restricted from having connection to more than 256 cells (128 memory bit pairs). The analysis to arrive at this quantity is similar to that for the open digitline architecture. Refer back to Table 3 to view the calculated results of power dissipation versus digitline length for a 256 Mbit DRAM in 8K refresh. Wordline length is again limited by the maximum allowable RC time constant of the wordline. Contrary to an open digitline architecture in which each wordline connects to memory bits on each digitline, the wordlines in a folded digitline architecture only connect to memory bits on alternating digitlines. Therefore, a wordline can cross 1024 digitlines while only connecting to 512 memory bit transistors. The wordlines will have twice the overall resistance, but only slightly more capacitance since the wordlines run over field oxide on alternating digitlines. Table 8 contains the effective wordline time constants for various wordline lengths for a folded array core. For a wordline connected to N memory bits, the total resistance and capacitance using 0.3 \u03bcm polysilicon are Rwl=2\ufffdN\ufffdPwl\ufffd0.3 \u03bcm ohms and Cwl=Cw8\ufffdN farads respectively. As shown in Table 8, the wordline length cannot exceed 512 memory bits (1024 digitlines) for the wordline time constant to remain under four nanoseconds. Although the wordline connects to only 512 memory bits, it is two times longer (1024 digitlines) than wordlines in open digitline array cores. The folded digitline architecture therefore requires half as many row decode blocks or wordline stitching regions as the open digitline architecture.}",

This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present invention. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that this invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof. Conclusion. A novel bilevel digitline architecture for use on advanced DRAM designs has been described. The bilevel digitline architecture achieves significant reductions in die size while maintaining the high signal to noise performance of traditional folded digitline architectures. The bilevel digitline uses vertically stacked digitline pairs connected to arrays of 6F2 or smaller memory cells. Vertical digitline twisting ensures balanced noise cancellation and equalizes the quantity of memory cells contacting each digitline. DRAM die size reduction results primarily from the use of smaller memory cells in crosspoint style arrays and secondarily from efficient pitch cell utilization. Overall, the bilevel digitline approach presented combines the best characteristics of both folded and open digitline architectures into an efficient new DRAM architecture. From Table 16 it can be concluded that overall die size (32 Mbit Area) is a better metric for comparison than array efficiency. For instance, the triple metal folded digitline design using hierarchical row decodes has an area of 34,089,440 \u03bcm2 and an efficiency of",
