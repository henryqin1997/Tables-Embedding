Two plays after finding Marshall, Cutler hit Kellen Davis in the middle of the end zone with 6:49 to play., 74479=The Bears got the ball back with 4:09 left but Cutler was sacked on consecutive plays -- by Jerel Worthy and Matthews -- and then was intercepted by a diving Jerron McMillia to effectively end the game., 75193=Cobb had a 20-yard reception on the Packers' ensuing march before ripping off a 28-yard run to the Bears' 11-yard line. A pair of sacks -- by Julius Peppers and Henry Melton -- and an incomplete pass brought on the field goal unit, but a kick was not in the script., 76089=Williams halted Chicago's next drive when he intercepted Cutler near midfield with 1:07 left in the second quarter. The turnover led to Crosby's 35-yarder and a 13-0 Green Bay lead at the half.}",
