For example, a station with 30 years of record between 1981 and 2010 with no missing years would be a more reliable normal than a station with 15 years of record and 2 missing years. Less than 100% possible observations indicates that out of the total number of observations used, some records were missing., 163203=*Normal indicates that all available data between 1981 and 2010 which qualified under the appropriate completeness rule for this element was used., 102882=Once the qualifying months were determined, the \"3/5\" rule was also applied to the number of months used to calculate average mean or average total within the thirty-year period. For instance, the \"normal\" value of a monthly element, such as normal maximum temperature for May, can have no more than 3 consecutive or 5 total missing months of May between 1981 to 2010., 101504=First, the average or total, as appropriate for the element, for all individual months was calculated for all locations. Normals values were then calculated as the mean for each month from all the individual months in the period that sufficiently fulfilled the requirement for completeness for 1981 to 2010. With the exception of the annual standard deviation (see calculations below), the annual normal value was calculated as the mean or total of monthly normals values only for stations where means or totals for every month of the year were available., 102264=Note: The \"3 and 5 rule\" is extracted from: \"Calculation of Monthly and Annual 30 Year Standard Normals\", Prepared by a meeting of experts, Washington, D.C., USA, March 1989. WMO-TD/No. 341 (WCDP-No. 10), Page 5., 125713=\"Freezing-free\" elements are calculated only for stations where daily minimum temperature observations are 100% complete from the period of July 15 to the last occurrence of Tmin less than or equal to 0 \u00b0C in \"spring\", and from July 15 to the first occurrence of Tmin less than or equal to 0 \u00b0C in \"fall\". At least one complete period must occur within 1981 to 2010., 129466=The calculation of most frequent wind direction has been updated in the 1981-2010 normals. Most frequent wind direction is based on the total number of occurrences of each of 36 possible directions (in 10's of degrees) for each month converted into one of 8 compass directions. For each of the 8 compass directions the total counts for these 10's of degrees are added together. The direction with the highest summed amount is the most frequent wind direction. The most frequent wind direction for the year is simply deduced as the summed direction with the highest total occurrence count for all months. The 8 compass directions are determined from the chart given below., 111679=The climate day at first order or primary observing sites is defined by the 24-hour period ending at 0600 UTC. The climate at volunteer observing sites ends at around 8:00 am local time and can vary somewhat from location to location., 126234=Frost normals (Average date of last Spring frost, Average date of first Fall frost and Average length of Frost-Free period) for the 1981-2010 period were calculated as means of the Julian days and represent the last \"spring\" frost, first \"fall\" frost and frost-free length., 108039=Besides the monthly averages and totals, extremes for selected elements by month including the daily maximum and minimum temperature, and the daily rainfall, snowfall, and total precipitation, and the dates of occurrence, were compiled and provided along with the normals elements. Extremes are compiled from the entire period of record of each location and not restricted to just the 1981-2010 normals period. In each case, the first or oldest date of occurrence is recorded below the extreme value. Values which occur more than once are identified with a (+). Bolded values and dates indicate the extreme for the year. Because no completeness requirements apply, no normals codes are assigned to extreme elements., 126548=Probability statistics are only generated for stations with at least 10 years of data. These statistics outline the probability of an event occurring either before or after a specified date. For example, a date of May 15th given for the 10th percentile of the \"Probability of last temperature in spring of 0 \u00b0C or lower on or after indicated dates\", implies that there is a 10% likelihood that the last spring frost occurred on either May 15th or later. Similarly a date of August 15th given for the 10th percentile of the \"Probability of first temperature in fall of 0 \u00b0C or lower on or before indicated dates\", implies that there is a 10% likelihood that the first fall frost occurred on either August 15th or earlier. Finally, a station with 100 days given for the 10th percentile of the \"Probability of frost-free period equal to or less than indicated period (Days)\", implies that there is a 10% likelihood that the frost-free period for the station is 100 days or less. Calculations for probability of spring freezing at x%, fall freezing at x% and freezing-free period at x% were completed using the same methodology. These statistics are calculated for the entire period of record for a station., 131698=For information on how most frequent wind direction was calculated in the previous normals, please refer to the document, Calculation of the 1971 to 2000 Climate Normals for Canada., 124042=Lake Evaporation normals for the 1981 to 2010 period were calculated as means of daily means for a given station. This in effect is a measure of the rate of evaporation per day rather than a measure of total evaporation as was calculated in the 1961 to 1990 normals. To make the 1981 to 2010 lake evaporation normal values comparable to previous calculations, multiply the 1981 to 2010 value by the number of days for a given month to obtain an equivalent estimate., 100280=There are many ways to calculate \"climate normals\"; the most useful ones adhere to accepted standards. The WMO considers thirty years long enough to eliminate year-to-year variations. Thus the WMO climatological standard period for normals calculations are computed over a 30 year period of consecutive records, starting January 1st and ending December 31st. In addition, the WMO established that normals should be arithmetic means calculated for each month of the year from daily data with a limited number of allowable missing values. For normals values representing averages, such as temperature, a month was not used if more than 3 consecutive days or more than a total of 5 days were missing. This rule is referred to as the \"3 and 5 rule\" established as a guideline for completeness by the WMO. Furthermore, its corresponding year-month mean should not be computed and should be considered missing. For normals values representing totals, such as precipitation, degree-days, or days with, an individual month was required to be 100% complete in order for it to be included in the normals calculation., 99642=The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends that countries prepare climate normals for the official 30-year normals periods ending in 1930, 1960 and 1990, for which the WMO World Climate Normals are published. In addition, WMO recommends the updating of climate normals at the end of every decade as provided here for 1981 to 2010., 122728=Measurements of soil temperature are made in accordance with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommendations at the standard depths of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150 and 300 cm. They are measured daily as close as possible to 08:00 LST and again at the shallowest depth at 16:00 LST., 136454=In the previous normals, wind chill was calculated when the temperature of the air was \u2264 10 \u00b0C and the reported wind speed was \u2265 5 km/h. The first equation listed below was used for these calculations. In the 1981-2010 normals there are two Wind Chill formulas used by Environment Canada. The first equation is used when the temperature of the air is \u2264 0 \u00b0C and the reported wind speed is \u2265 5 km/h. The second equation is used when the temperature of the air is \u2264 0 \u00b0C and the reported wind speed is > 0 km/h but < 5 km/h., 124945=Freezing occurs whenever temperatures fall to 0 \u00b0C or lower. Frost data normals are based on the occurrence of freezing temperatures as recorded from minimum thermometers. The \"Freezing-free Period\" is defined as the number of days between the last occurrence of frost in spring and first occurrence of frost in the fall for a given year. For the purpose of these calculations, \"spring\" is defined as days on or before July 15, \"fall\" is defined as days after July 15 and freezing or frost occurs on any day where the daily minimum temperature (Tmin) is observed to be less than or equal to 0 \u00b0C.}",
