The switching action takes place by depressing a button that interrupts the optical path between an infrared LED and a photodiode or phototransistor. This provides a momentary \"low Mechanical Switches . Manual switches can have one or a combination of switching actions. In momentary-action switches, the operator pushes (pushbutton or toggle) or twists (rotary) the actuating device and contacts move to transfer the circuits to the second set of contacts.
