These can be the ionomer resins described above, combined in a weight ratio which preferably is within the range of 10:90 to 90:10 parts of high and low acid ionomer resins., 17309=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/048,701 filed Mar. 26, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,213,895 issued on Apr. 10, 2001. This application claims priority on U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/042,439 filed Mar. 28, 1997., 163431=Examples of the more pertinent acrylic acid based hard ionomer resin suitable for use in the present outer cover composition sold under the lotek\ufffd trade name by the Exxon Corporation include lotek\ufffd 8000, 8010, 8020, 8030, 7030, 7010, 7020,1002, 1003, 959 and 960. The physical properties of lotek\ufffd 959 and 960 are shown above. The typical properties of the remainder of these and other lotek\ufffd hard ionomers suited for use in formulating the outer layer cover composition are set forth below in Table 9:, 57682=Examples of the high acid acrylic acid based ionomers suitable for use in the present invention also include the Escor\ufffd or lotek\ufffd high acid ethylene acrylic acid ionomers produced by Exxon such as Ex 1001, 1002, 959, 960, 989, 990, 1003, 1004, 993, 994. In this regard, Escor\ufffd or lotek\ufffd 959 is a sodium ion neutralized ethylene-acrylic neutralized ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer. According to Exxon, lotek\ufffd 959 and 960 contain from about 19.0 to 21.0% by weight acrylic acid with approximately 30 to about 70 percent of the acid groups neutralized with sodium and zinc ions, respectively. The physical properties of these high acid acrylic acid based ionomers are set forth in Tables 1 and 2 as follows:, 133809=The outer layer in another embodiment of the invention includes a blend of a soft (low acid) ionomer resin with a small amount of a hard (high acid) ionomer resin. A low modulus ionomer suitable for use in the outer layer blend has a flexural modulus measuring from about 1,000 to about 10,000 psi, with a hardness of about 20 to about 40 on the Shore D scale. A high modulus ionomer herein is one which measures from about 15,000 to about 70,000 psi as measured in accordance with ASTM method D-790. The hardness may be defined as at least 50 on the Shore D scale as measured in accordance with ASTM method D-2240., 40314=The inner layer compositions include the high acid ionomers such as those developed by E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company under the trademark Surlyn\ufffd and by Exxon Corporation under the trademark Escor\ufffd or trade name lotek\ufffd, or blends thereof. Examples of compositions which may be used as the inner layer herein are set forth in detail in a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/174,765, now abandoned, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/776,803 filed Oct. 15, 1991, now abandoned, and Ser. No. 08/493,089, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,869, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 07/981,751, now abandoned, which in turn is a continuation of Ser. No. 07/901,660 filed Jun. 19, 1992, now abandoned, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Of course, the inner layer high acid ionomer compositions are not limited in any way to those compositions set forth in said applications.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon a reading and understanding the preceding detailed description. It is intended that the invention be construed as including all such modifications and alterations in so far as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. The resulting golf ball produced from the hard inner layer and the relatively softer, low flexural modulus outer layer provide for an improved multi-layer golf ball having a unique dual core configuration which provides for desirable coefficient of restitution and durability properties while at the same time offering the feel and spin characteristics associated with soft balata and balata-like covers of the prior art. After molding, the golf balls produced may undergo various further processing steps such as buffing, painting and marking as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,911,451. In compression molding, the inner cover composition is formed via injection at about 380\ufffd F. to about 450\ufffd F. into smooth surfaced hemispherical shells which are then positioned around the core in a mold having the desired inner cover thickness and subjected to compression molding at 200\ufffd to 300\ufffd F. for about 2 to 10 minutes, followed by cooling at 50\ufffd to 70\ufffd F. for about 2 to 7 minutes to fuse the shells together to form a unitary intermediate ball.
