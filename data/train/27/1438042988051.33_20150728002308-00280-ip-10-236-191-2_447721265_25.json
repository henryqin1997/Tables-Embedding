    "textBeforeTable": "The previous calculations represent a simple condition, but they allow for some visualization of VES capabilities. Based on these calculations, the average detection distances for each VES tested in the rain condition (i.e., rate of 10.2 cm/h (4 inches/h), windshield wiper on highest speed) are not long enough to provide adequate stopping distances for vehicle speeds at anything close to or greater than 56.3 km/h (35 mi/h); however, some caveats apply. First, these distances were obtained while drivers were moving at approximately 16.1 km/h (10 mi/h), and drivers\u2019 abilities to detect objects will not necessarily remain the same as speed increases. Second, systems that are currently close to the adequate stopping distance or that require a larger stopping distance might quickly become less effective when conditions worsen (e.g., worn tires, downhill condition, heavier rain). Third and most important, when detection distances are analyzed in more detail by examining the significant (p < 0.05) VES by Object interaction, different conclusions can be reached (table 21 through table 32). Several VES and object combinations resulted in detection distances that might compromise stopping distances. As in the clear weather study (ENV Volume III), detection and recognition distances under the rain condition were strongly affected by the characteristics of the object, but the type of VES modulated this effect. The HID, HLB\u2013LP, and IR\u2013TIS provided the shortest detection distances for low-contrast objects; the HLB supplemented by UV\u2013A allowed drivers to detect the pedestrians and cyclists dressed with white clothing",
