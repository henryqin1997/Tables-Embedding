The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2004 compared to September 30, 2003 resulted from net $2.2 million purchases of short-term investments, the payment of $0.6 million for the acquisition of the SecureVault product line from Ariel Distributing, the payment of $0.7 million for a product development agreement with Integra Group, Inc., $1.0 million paid as part of the BCX acquisition, including $0.5 million paid as part of the purchase price and $0.5 million paid relating to the achievement of performance milestones in 2003. Cash used for capital expenditures, which included expenditures for leasehold improvements, computer equipment, and software, increased to $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 from $1.5 million for the same period in 2003. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2003 includes higher levels of spending related to the BCX acquisition., 704296=Factors That May Affect Future Operating Results, 812370=The following reports on Form 8-K were filed during the three month period ended September 30, 2004:, 817808=Date: November 9, 2004, 270887=The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company\u0092s December\u00a031, 2003 audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company\u0092s Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or for the entire fiscal year ending December\u00a031, 2004., 788560=Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting., 533907=Management believes there have been no significant changes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004, to the items which we disclosed as our critical accounting policies in Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003., 22825=Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, 779796=While we have implemented a Privacy and Use of Information Policy and strictly adhere to established privacy principles, use of customer information guidelines and federal and state statutes and regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. This legislation required the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to adopt national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions, to adopt standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and to establish a schedule\u00a0for implementing national health data privacy legislation or regulations. In August\u00a02002, HHS published final modifications to its privacy regulations that took effect on April\u00a014, 2003. These regulations restrict the use and disclosure of personally identifiable health information by our customers who are \u0091\u0091covered entities\u0092\u0092 under HIPAA. Because Omnicell may be considered a \u0091\u0091business associate\u0092\u0092 under HIPAA, many of our customers have required that we enter into written agreements governing the way we handle any patient information we may encounter in providing our products and services. In February\u00a02003, HHS issued final security rules requiring covered entities to implement appropriate technical and physical safeguards of electronically transmitted personal health information by April\u00a02005. We cannot predict the potential impact of these rules, rules that have not yet been proposed or any other rules that might be finally adopted on our customers or on Omnicell. In addition, other federal and/or state privacy legislation may be enacted at any time. These laws and regulations could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information. This could reduce the demand for our products or force us to redesign our products in order to meet regulatory requirements., 525775=In July 2004, Omnicell filed a registration statement on Form S-3 which, when effective, will enable the Company to offer and sell, from time to time, its securities in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $100 million., 833574=(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Previously filed as Exhibit\u00a04.1 to our Registration Statement on Form\u00a0S-1, as amended, as filed with the Security Exchange Commission on March 14, 2001., 397637=On August\u00a015, 2003, Omnicell acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of BCX Technology, Inc., a privately held company headquartered in Lebanon, Tennessee.\u00a0 BCX Technology, Inc., formed in 1995, is a software provider for inventory management solutions in acute care hospital settings. As part of the acquisition, Omnicell acquired the rights to ScanREQ, a state-of-the-art touch screen monitor and bar code scanning system. The financial results of BCX Technology, Inc. have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Pro forma results for 2003 as if BCX Technology, Inc. was acquired on January\u00a01, 2003 are not materially different from Omnicell\u0092s reported 2003 results. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination with a total purchase price of $4.0 million, which included $3.0 million paid at the time of purchase, and $1.0 million paid in January\u00a02004 pursuant to the achievement of performance milestones in 2003. In connection with the acquisition, Omnicell also assumed certain liabilities of BCX Technology, Inc. totaling $0.1 million and incurred approximately $60,000 of acquisition related costs.\u00a0 Additionally, the acquisition agreement requires Omnicell to pay up to $1.0 million before January\u00a01, 2006 if certain performance milestones are achieved in 2004 and 2005. The Company allocated the purchase price to the tangible assets acquired based on management\u0092s estimate of their fair values.\u00a0 The fair values of the intangible assets, including the acquired current technology and trade name, were based upon the income approach to valuation. Under the income approach, the Company assumed a cash flow period of five years, revenue growth rates of 5% to 25% on an annual basis and a discount rate of 20%.\u00a0 The purchase price allocation was as follows (in thousands):, 464691=The Company offers customers multi-year, non-cancelable payment terms.\u00a0 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004, sales of medication and supply dispensing systems sold with multi-year payment terms totaled approximately $13.1 million and $29.5 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, sales of medication and supply dispensing systems sold with multi-year payment terms totaled approximately $6.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively. The Company typically sells the customers\u0092 multi-year payment agreements to a third-party leasing company.\u00a0 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004, customer multi-year payment term agreements sold to third-party leasing companies totaled approximately $12.6 million and $27.7\u00a0million, respectively.\u00a0 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, customer multi-year payment term agreements sold to third-party leasing companies totaled approximately $6.8 million and $22.9\u00a0million, respectively.\u00a0 The Company has no obligation under a multi-year payment agreement once it is sold to the finance company. Revenue is recognized upon completion of the Company\u0092s installation obligation, if any, and commencement of the noncancelable multi-year payment term. At September 30, 2004 and December\u00a031, 2003, accounts receivable included $4.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively, from the finance companies for multi-year payment term agreements sold., 410320=\u00a0On December\u00a06, 2002, Omnicell purchased substantially all of the intellectual property assets of Medisafe, a provider of point-of-care patient safety solutions. As part of the transaction, Omnicell acquired technology for a new bedside medication management solution called SafetyMed. This solution automates the nursing workflow process associated with medication administration and uses bar code technology to help ensure patient safety. The total purchase price was $3.0 million, which included $1.5 million paid at the date of purchase, $1.0 million paid in June\u00a02003 after completion of certain obligations by Medisafe, and $0.5 million in guaranteed minimum royalties due in equal annual installments of $0.1 million beginning in January\u00a02005. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $20,000 of acquisition related costs.\u00a0 The Company allocated the purchase price to the acquired intangible assets and purchased in-process research and development based on the income approach to valuation.\u00a0 Under the income approach, the Company assumed a cash flow period of five years, revenue growth rates of 33% to 210% on an annual basis and discount rates of 25% to 35%.\u00a0 The purchase price allocation was as follows (in thousands):, 482867=The following table sets forth the facility costs reserve activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 (in thousands):, 531244=\u00a0We recognize revenue when our medication and supply dispensing systems are installed. Installation generally takes place three to six months after our systems are ordered since the acceptance process of our customers includes internal procedures associated with large capital expenditures and the time associated with adopting new technologies. Given the length of time for our customers to accept installation of our systems and to be more predictable and efficient in our manufacturing and installation processes, our focus is on shipping products based on the installation dates as requested by our customers and on growing product backlog. Product backlog is defined as the amount of medication and supply dispensing systems that have shipped to customers but have not yet been installed at the customer site plus the amount of such systems that have not shipped but for which we have purchase orders, and which we believe will be installed within the next 12 months. We increased our product backlog by $3.3 million during the quarter to $49.7 million as of September 30, 2004., 797453=In accordance with Section\u00a010A(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the \u0093Act\u0094), we are required to disclose the non-audit services approved by our Audit Committee to be performed by our external auditor. During the three months ended September 30, 2004, our Audit Committee approved the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP to perform services related to the review of the Company\u0092s compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which constitute in part non-audit services within the meaning of Section 10A(i) of the Act., 269291=The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared by management, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States pursuant to instructions to Form\u00a010-Q and Article\u00a010 of Regulation\u00a0S-X related to interim financial information.\u00a0 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u0092s rules and regulations. The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, APRS, Inc., Omnicell HealthCare Canada,\u00a0Inc., and BCX Technology, Inc.\u00a0 All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which would include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2004 and the results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented have been made. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December\u00a031, 2003 has been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date., 683699=Provisions for income taxes were recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003. These provisions were attributable to federal and state alternative minimum taxes and other state taxes. The amounts provided were at rates less than the combined U.S. federal and state statutory rates due to the recognition of federal and state net operating loss carry forwards., 528799=We started our business in 1992 and began offering our supply automation systems for sale in 1993. In late 1996, we introduced our Omnicell medication dispensing system. In January\u00a01999, we expanded our line of medication dispensing systems and customer base with the acquisition of the Sure-Med product line from Baxter Healthcare Corporation. In August\u00a02002, we acquired APRS, Inc. to support, develop, and market integrated system solutions to health system pharmacies.\u00a0 This central pharmacy carousel storage and retrieval solution is sold under our Omnicell Pharmacy Central product name. In December\u00a02002, we purchased the intellectual property assets of Medisafe, a provider of point-of-care bedside automation solutions called SafetyMed. In August\u00a02003, we acquired BCX Technology,\u00a0Inc., a provider of open bar code supply management systems branded ScanREQ, to complement our cabinet-based supply solutions. In March\u00a02004, we acquired Ariel Distributing, Inc.\u0092s closed-loop, controlled substance inventory management software for healthcare system pharmacies, used and marketed by us under the product name SecureVault. \u00a0From inception through September 30, 2004, we had completed our installation obligations, if any, for an aggregate of 31,104 of our medication and supply dispensing systems at 1,534 healthcare facilities., 731040=We had net losses of $1.2 million and $5.0 million in 2001 and 2002 respectively. While we were profitable with net income of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase profitability in the future on a quarterly or annual basis., 98616=2004, 4112=QUARTERLY REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 537753=Nine Months Ended September 30,, 732427=For the 12 months prior to September 30, 2004 and for the period between October 1, 2004 and November 3, 2004, our common stock has traded between $8.95 and $22.64 per share. The market price for shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile. In addition, our announcements or external events may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock. These announcements or external events may include:, 810389=(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Previously filed as Exhibit\u00a04.1 to our Registration Statement on Form\u00a0S-1, as amended, as filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on March 14, 2001., 332803=The Company reports segments in accordance with SFAS No. 131, \u0093Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.\u0094 SFAS 131 requires the use of a management approach in identifying segments of an enterprise. The Company derives the majority of its revenues from medication and supply cabinet-based systems, which are treated as one segment for purposes of SFAS 131. These systems are similar in terms of their shared multiple common assemblies and subassemblies, as well as their basic operation and visual characteristics, and are used by hospitals and healthcare facilities to improve patient safety and care and enhance operational efficiency. The Company has two operating segments: the medication and supply dispensing systems and the e-commerce business. The Company\u0092s chief operating decision-maker reviews information pertaining to reportable segments to the operating income level. There are no significant inter-segment sales or transfers. Assets of the operating segments are not segregated and substantially all of the Company\u0092s long-lived assets are located in the United States. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, substantially all of the Company\u0092s total revenues and gross profits were generated by the medication and supply dispensing systems operating segment. The Web-based e-commerce business operating segment generated less than 1.5% of consolidated revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003. The operating loss generated by the Web-based e-commerce segment was approximately $0.2 million and $0.1\u00a0million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The operating loss generated by the Web-based e-commerce segment was approximately $0.4 million and $0.5\u00a0million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively., 694198=We have net operating lease commitments of $6.7 million payable when due through 2009 as follows (in thousands):, 277684=The Company measures goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for impairment when indicators of impairment exist and at least on an annual basis. The intangible asset with an indefinite life consists of the trade name acquired as part of the BCX Technology, Inc. acquisition. No impairment of goodwill or the intangible asset with an indefinite life was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003. The Company had goodwill of $2.1 million and an intangible asset with an indefinite life of $0.2 million as of September 30, 2004., 480171=\u00a0Although the Company had no contractual obligation to do so, in July\u00a02002, it executed an agreement to purchase from Americorp Financial,\u00a0Inc. (\u0093AFI\u0094) all residual interests in Omnicell equipment covered by multi-year payment agreements financed by AFI. The total purchase price was $3.1\u00a0million. The purchase price was assigned to the acquired payment residuals based on the original implied payment residual value, equipment type, and the Company\u0092s assessment of the customers\u0092 likelihood of renewal at the end of the payment term. As equipment is renewed or upgraded, the Company charges the assigned value to cost of product revenues. When equipment is not renewed or upgraded at the end of the lease contract or when the Company believes a renewal is unlikely, the assigned value is written off. The payment streams associated with the purchased residuals expire at various dates within four years from the date of the purchase agreement. The value of purchased residuals as of September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003 was $1.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively, and is recorded in other assets., 830307=Certifications required by Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. \u00a71350)., 335352=Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of shares and, if dilutive, common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents include the effect of outstanding dilutive stock options and warrants, computed using the treasury stock method. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, options to purchase 492,078 and 1,726,170 shares, respectively, with an exercise price greater than $15.60 and $7.52, the average fair market value per share for the period, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share as their effect was antidilutive., 469493=December 31, 2003, 618463=Product Revenues. Product revenues increased 26.5% to $26.8\u00a0million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 from $21.2\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. Product revenues increased 22.3% to $72.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 from $59.2\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. The increase in product revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 was due to an increase in the number of medication and supply dispensing system installations, an increase in revenue associated with our provision of software programs that interface our system with our customers\u0092 system, and an increase in revenue from multi-year payment arrangements resulting in an increase in the size of the average customer deal. Part of this increase can be attributed to our emphasis on closing larger and more complex deals with larger healthcare facilities. Product revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 also included revenues of BCX Technologies, Inc. acquired in the third quarter of 2003. We expect product revenues to experience modest growth throughout the remainder of 2004., 97357=Nine Months Ended September 30,, 792294=On June 30, 2004, ePlus Government Inc., a leasing company which has purchased some of the Company\u0092s receivables with recourse, filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Commonwealth of Virginia, seeking payment of approximately $1.7 million in connection with a customer\u0092s failure to pay ePlus amounts owed under a\u00a0contract with such customer\u00a0that have been\u00a0assigned to ePlus. The Company recorded the transaction as receivable subject to a sales agreement in compliance with SFAS 140 requirements as discussed in \u0093Sales of Accounts Receivable\u0094 under Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements., 642698=Cost of Service and Other Revenues. Cost of service and other revenues increased 8.7% to $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 from $2.1 million in the same period in 2003. Cost of service and other revenues increased 17.4% to $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 from $5.5 million in the same period in 2003. For the three months ended September 30, 2004, gross margin on service and other revenues was $3.7\u00a0million, or 61.4% of service and other revenues as compared to $3.1\u00a0million, or 59.3% of service and other revenues in the same period in 2003. The increase in gross margin on services and other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2004 was a result of increased revenues from the roll out of multi-tiered pricing packages for premium services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, gross margin on service and other revenues was $10.9\u00a0million, or 62.6% of service and other revenues as compared to $8.9\u00a0million, or 61.6% of service and other revenues in the same period in 2003. The increase in gross margin on service and other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 reflects a reduction in cost from the transition from an outsourced service model to an internal service organization, partially offset by increased costs due to the change to the service call center model which provides extended hours of coverage to customers. We expect the cost of services and other revenues will continue to fluctuate based on our ability to improve cost efficiencies from our internal service organization., 668926=Restructuring and Severance Charges. In fiscal 2004 and 2003, we restructured our organization to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies. As part of this restructuring, we reduced headcount by 3 employees in 2004 and by 14 employees in 2003. As a result, we recorded restructuring and severance charges of $0.2 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2003, primarily related to employee severance and benefits., 814522=Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed in its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized., 809637=(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Previously filed as Exhibit\u00a03.6 to our Registration Statement on Form\u00a0S-1, as amended, as filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on March 14, 2001., 667238=Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative costs increased 23.4% to $13.3\u00a0million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 from $10.8\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. Selling, general and administrative costs increased 23.1% to $38.4\u00a0million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 from $31.2\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is a result of increased headcount to support the targeted increases in revenue and bookings and continued business growth. We increased headcount in our selling, general and administrative areas by approximately 22.0% from September 30, 2003 to September 30 2004, with half of the growth concentrated in sales and customer service functions. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased as a percentage of total revenues to 40.7% in the three months ended September 30, 2004 compared to 40.9% in the same period in 2003. Selling, general and administrative costs increased as a percentage of total revenues to 42.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2004 compared to 42.4% in the same period in 2003. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase slightly during the remainder of 2004 in order to support our continued business growth., 690797=We generated $7.5 million from financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2004 compared to $7.3 million generated in the first nine months of 2003. Financing activities consisted of raising funds through issuances of our common stock primarily as a result of the exercise of employee stock options and stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan. Although the cash generated from financing activities increased only slightly year-to-year, the proceeds from the issuance of common stock increased by $2.7 million from 2003 to 2004. This increase was offset, however, by approximately $3.1 million in proceeds from stockholder\u0092s notes receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2003., 418241=On August\u00a030, 2002, Omnicell acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of APRS, Inc., a privately held company headquartered in Houston, Texas. APRS, Inc. was formed in 1997 to support, develop, and market integrated system solutions to health system pharmacies. The financial results of APRS, Inc. have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Pro forma results for Omnicell for 2002 as if APRS, Inc. was acquired on January\u00a01, 2002 are not materially different from Omnicell\u0092s reported 2002 results. In connection with the acquisition, Omnicell paid cash of $1.0 million, assumed certain liabilities of APRS, Inc. totaling $0.5 million and incurred approximately $20,000 of acquisition related costs.\u00a0 The Company allocated the purchase price to the intangible assets and purchased in-process research and development based on the income approach to valuation. Under the income approach, the Company assumed a cash flow period of five years, revenue growth rates of 13% to 21% on an annual basis and a discount rate of 30%.\u00a0 The purchase price allocation was as follows (in thousands):, 694861=2004, 787320=Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our \u0093disclosure controls and procedures\u0094 (\u0093Disclosure Controls\u0094) as of September 30, 2004. The controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer (\u0093CEO\u0094) and Chief Financial Officer (\u0093CFO\u0094). Based on the evaluation as of September 30, 2004, our CEO and CFO have concluded that Omnicell\u0092s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u0093Exchange Act\u0094)) were sufficiently effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Omnicell in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is gathered, analyzed and disclosed with adequate timeliness, accuracy and completeness., 276162=Revenues generated from customers in North America for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 totaled 99.8% and 97.0% of total revenues, respectively.\u00a0 No single customer accounted for more than 10.0% of total revenues, while one particular group of affiliated hospitals accounted for 11.4% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2004. There was no customer that accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in the same period last year. Revenues generated from customers in North America for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 totaled 98.1% and 97.3% of total revenues, respectively. One leasing company accounted for 26.0% of accounts receivable at September 30, 2004. The same leasing company accounted for 18.0% of accounts receivable at December\u00a031, 2003., 767246=We acquired two new products in the second half of 2002 and one new product in the third quarter of 2003, Omnicell PharmacyCentral, SafetyMed and ScanREQ, all of which we believe are competitive in their respective markets and will meet the demands of our customers for central pharmacy storage and retrieval, bedside automation and open supply management. Our current business goals are dependent in part on customer acceptance of these new products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in marketing these products, that these products will compete effectively with similar products sold by our competitors or that the level of market acceptance of such products will be sufficient to generate expected revenues and synergies with our other products., 621390=Cost of product revenues increased 30.6% to $11.3\u00a0million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 from $8.7\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. Cost of product revenues increased 18.5% to $29.9\u00a0million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 from $25.2\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. The increase in cost of product revenues was attributable to the increase in headcount and temporary labor, in part required by the installation of units near the end of the quarter that had only been ordered earlier in the same quarter, as well as the increase in charges related to the renewal of existing multi-year payment term agreements related to purchased residuals., 489627=Balance at September 30, 2004, 805480=Certification of Chief Executive Officer required by Rule 13a-14(a) or Rule 15d-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended., 812796=(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On July 22, 2004, we filed a current report on Form 8-K relating to the issuance of a press release announcing Omnicell\u0092s financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2004., 527562=In addition to historical information, this report contains predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section\u00a021E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Actual results could differ materially from any future performance suggested in this report as a result of many factors, including those referred to in \u0093Factors That May Affect Future Operating Results\u0094 contained elsewhere in this report. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report, 285376=Revenues from the Company\u0092s Web-based procurement application are recognized ratably over the subscription period. Web-based procurement application revenues were not significant (less than 1.5% of total revenues) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, and are included in product and service and other revenue., 38905=September 30, 2004, 685501=Product backlog is the dollar value of medication and supply dispensing systems that have shipped to customers but are not yet installed at the customer site plus the dollar value of such systems that have not shipped but for which we have purchase orders, and which we believe will be installed within the next 12 months. We have made significant efforts to increase our backlog each quarter and reduce our reliance on \u0093turns\u0094 business. Turns business represents customer orders received and installed in the same quarter. We believe a material reduction in turns business will reduce the cost of product revenues, produce more predictable and sustainable quarterly growth and facilitate improved customer service. Reliance on turns business creates inefficiencies in the underlying operating model for the company, adding expenses in planning, building, and installing product. It also can increase finished goods inventory and reduce visibility of future revenues, since it often involves accelerating normal installation schedules from a future quarter. We intend to continue to build our product backlog and work to reduce our reliance on turns business. Our product backlog increased $3.3 million to $49.7 million as of September 30, 2004, from $46.4 million as of June 30, 2004., 266986=The Company\u0092s solutions enable healthcare facilities to acquire, manage, dispense and deliver pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. Omnicell\u0092s medication and supply dispensing systems facilitate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies at the point of care. These systems interface with healthcare facilities\u0092 existing information systems to accurately capture and display critical patient data. In 2002, Omnicell acquired two additional products, PharmacyCentral, a central pharmacy carousel storage and retrieval solution, and SafetyMed, a bedside automation solution.\u00a0 In August\u00a02003, Omnicell acquired BCX Technology,\u00a0Inc., a provider of open bar code supply management systems branded ScanREQ, to complement its cabinet-based supply solutions. Omnicell\u0092s physician order management system streamlines communication between nursing and pharmacy staff. Omnicell\u0092s decision support solution allows healthcare facilities to monitor trends in drug utilization and diversion, improve regulatory compliance and reduce costs by monitoring usage patterns and optimizing product management. Omnicell\u0092s Internet-based procurement application automates and integrates healthcare facilities\u0092 requisition and approval processes. In March\u00a02004, Omnicell acquired Ariel Distributing, Inc.\u0092s closed-loop, controlled substance inventory management software for healthcare system pharmacies, used and marketed by Omnicell under the product name SecureVault. \u00a0This solution further enables Omnicell to provide comprehensive, end-to-end solutions for the medication-use process., 459513=2007, 782577=In February\u00a02003, our Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that is beneficial to our stockholders. Pursuant to the terms of the plan, when a person or group, except under certain circumstances, acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock (other than two current stockholders and their affiliated entities, which will not trigger the rights plan unless they acquire beneficial ownership of 17.5% and 22.5% or more, respectively, of our outstanding common stock) or ten business days after commencement or announcement of a tender, 789208=Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. The company\u0092s management, including CEO and CFO, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u0092s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, our Disclosure Controls and our internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our CEO and CFO have concluded, based on their evaluation, that our Disclosure Controls and procedures were sufficiently effective as of September 30, 2004., 461665=2009, 719910=The healthcare industry has faced, and will likely continue to face, significant financial constraints. For example, the shift to managed care in the 1990s put pressure on healthcare organizations to reduce costs, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 significantly reduced Medicare reimbursement to healthcare organizations. Our automation solutions often involve a significant financial commitment by our customers, and, as a result, our ability to grow our business is largely dependent on our customers\u0092 information technology budgets. To the extent healthcare information technology spending declines or increases more slowly than we anticipate, demand for our products and services would be negatively affected., 396294=On March\u00a011, 2004, Omnicell acquired Ariel Distributing, Inc.\u0092s closed-loop, controlled substance inventory management software for healthcare system pharmacies, used and marketed by Omnicell as SecureVault.\u00a0 The total purchase price was $0.7 million, which included $0.5 million paid at the date of purchase, $0.1 million paid in May\u00a02004 after completion of certain obligations by Ariel Distributing, Inc., and up to a maximum of $0.1 million in guaranteed minimum royalty payments, due quarterly and calculated as a percentage of license fees recognized by Omnicell for up to a maximum of two years.\u00a0 The total purchase price of $0.7 million will be amortized over five years using the straight-line method., 457357=2005, 622377=Gross profit on product revenue was $15.4\u00a0million, or 57.6% of product revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2004, as compared to $12.5\u00a0million, or 59.0% of product revenues in the same period in 2003. The decrease in gross profit on product revenue during the three-month period is a result of higher costs due to a change in product mix as well as the recognition of costs associated with purchased residual interests in Omnicell equipment covered by multi-year payment agreements financed by a third party. Gross profit on product revenue was $42.5\u00a0million, or 58.7% of product revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, as compared to $34.0\u00a0million, or 57.4% of product revenues in the same period in 2003. The increase in the gross profit on product revenues during the nine-month period is a result of increased efficiencies in operations, manufacturing and installation services. We expect the cost of product revenues to increase consistently with product revenue growth, maintaining approximately the same level of gross profit margin throughout the rest of 2004., 5030=For the quarterly period ended September 30, 2004, 703663=There were no significant changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures in market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices from the Company\u0092s Form\u00a010-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ended December\u00a031, 2003., 688159=Net cash used by operating activities was $3.0 million during the first nine months of 2004 compared to $6.3 million provided in the same period in 2003. Net income was $8.0 million during the first nine months of 2004 compared to $4.1 million in the same period in 2003. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from the reduction in accrued liabilities, increased inventories, accounts receivables, prepaid expenses, and other assets which included an increase of $1.9 million for internally-billed receivables with multi-year sales agreements, offset by increases in accounts payable and deferred services. Inventories increased by $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 as a result of inventory build up for expected customer orders that were not shipped during the period. We expect that most of these orders will be shipped during the fourth quarter of 2004., 394392=On October 13, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123R, \u0093Share-Based Payment,\u0094 which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share-based payments (including employee stock options) at fair value and is effective for all public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Retroactive application of the requirements of FASB Statement No. 123 to the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the effective date would be permitted, but not required. Early adoption of Statement 123R is encouraged\u00a0 The pro forma impact of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 on our historical financial statements is included in the footnotes to the financial statements. The Company expects to continue to grant stock options to employees and the impact of the adoption of the new standard is likely to have a material impact on its future results of operations., 535719=The following table sets forth certain items included in our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, expressed as a percentage of total revenues for these periods:, 808087=(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Previously filed as the like-numbered Exhibit to our report on Form\u00a010-Q for the quarter ended June\u00a030, 2001, as filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on September 20, 2001., 808866=(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Previous filed as the like-numbered Exhibit to our report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, as filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on March 28, 2003., 806410=Certification of Chief Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14(a) or Rule 15d-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended., 13468=1201 Charleston Road Mountain View, CA 94043 (650)\u00a0251-6100, 485883=Balance at December 31, 2003, 20855=Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2004 and December\u00a031, 2003, 832824=(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Previously filed as Exhibit\u00a03.6 to our Registration Statement on Form\u00a0S-1, as amended, as filed with the Security Exchange Commission on March 14, 2001., 289535=Development costs related to software implemented in the Company\u0092s medication and supply dispensing systems and incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the related products ranging from 3 to 5 years. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model, which is a matter of judgment using the guidelines of SFAS No. 86, \u0093Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.\u0094 All such development costs incurred prior to the completion of a working model are recognized as research and development expense. As of September 30, 2004 and December\u00a031, 2003, the balance of capitalized software development costs was approximately $1.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively. These costs are reported as a component of other assets. Amortization of capitalized software development costs was $0.0 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amortization of capitalized software development costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 was $0.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively., 687440=Our principal sources of liquidity, which include cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, totaled approximately $32.6 million as of September 30, 2004 compared to $36.3 million as of June 30, 2004, $36.2 million as of March 31, 2004 and $33.5 million as of December\u00a031, 2003.

Section 1350)., 665772=Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased 9.8% to $2.5\u00a0million for the three months ended September 30, 2004, from $2.3\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. The increase was due primarily to increased spending on software development, cost reduction initiatives for which we will receive future benefits, product documentation and integration of acquired technology, and engineering endeavors to improve on product quality and reliability. Research and development expenses remained flat at $6.7\u00a0million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003. Research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to 7.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2004 compared to 8.6% in the same period in 2003. Research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to 7.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2004 compared to 9.1% in the same period in 2003. We expect research and development expense to increase during the remainder of 2004 in order to support continued new product development and research activities., 537105=Three Months Ended September 30,, 21790=Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, 458398=2006, 831831=(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Previous filed as the like-numbered Exhibit to our report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, as filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on March 28, 2003., 278568=Purchased intangible assets with finite lives include acquired developed software technology, service contracts, customer relationships and backlog acquired in a business combination. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of three to six years. Additionally, purchased intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. No impairment of purchased intangible assets with finite lives was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003., 481925=In December 2003, the Company recorded facility costs of $0.4 million related to the move of its corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility to its current location in Mountain View, California. This move was initiated to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies. The facility costs consisted of remaining rent expense and the write-off of the remaining leasehold improvements related to the Company\u0092s former facilities in Palo Alto, California. The lease related to Omnicell\u0092s former manufacturing facility expired in February 2004.

In our judgment and based on our history with these accounts, we believe these receivables are collectible. However, in the future, the failure of any of our U.S. government customers to receive their annual funding could impair our ability to sell to these customers or to sell our U.S. government receivables to third-party leasing companies. In addition, the ability to collect payments on unsold receivables could be impaired and may result in a write down of our unsold receivables to U.S. government customers. As of September 30, 2004 the balance of our unsold leases to U.S. government customers was $3.9 million., 455974=2004 (remaining 3 months), 641625=Service and Other Revenues. Service and other revenues includes revenues from service and maintenance contracts and rentals of automation systems. Service and other revenues increased 14.7% to $6.0\u00a0million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 from $5.2\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. Service and other revenues increased 20.7% to $17.4\u00a0million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 from $14.4\u00a0million in the same period in 2003. The increase in service and other revenues was primarily due to the increase in our installed base of automation systems and an increase in support service contracts.
