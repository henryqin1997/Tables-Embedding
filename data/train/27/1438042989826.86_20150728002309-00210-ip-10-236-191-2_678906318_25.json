Energy restriction in genetically obese animals greatly increases longevity and slows signs of aging, even when animals remain obese.Typically, a 40% reduction in food intake below that of animals eating freely increases the length of life in rodents by 50% (Masoro, 1994). Studies on rhesus monkeys suggest that the antiaging effects of calorie restriction in rodents can also occur in longer-lived species (Lane et al, 1997). These studies strengthen the possibility that calorie restriction will also prove beneficial in humans.
