    "textAfterTable": "Many people believe that community colleges are a joke, but they really are not. Laredo Community College (LCC) taught me not only academically, but socially as well. I learned to build on different social, self, and academic skills that made me a better student and over all person. I was taught to work with different people and the responsibility of juggling a full class schedule of about 15 to 16 hours a semester on top of extra-curricular activities. I was honored to be selected as a student of the LC.C. Honors Program where I learned the values of teamwork, hard work, and studying. I will admit that some of the professors treat their classroom and students as if still at the high school level, but there are a handful of the strict, but knowledgeable professors that teach in what can be known as a four year university level class. LCC taught me well how to be a better student. I feel prepared to enter and succeed at a four year university level after all I've learned.
