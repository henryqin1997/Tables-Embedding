    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{966963=I have not begun but I have heard is is very fast paced. I put my papers in on August 27th 2013 and my final due date is September 9th., 489996=May be better for students who are on campus., 179772=I started attending Full Sail online in August then transferred to on-campus class this November passed. I must say I am learning a lot these past couple months here. I had high expectations for Full Sail University and so far . . . they have met them., 15547=Full Sail has a number of clubs and will stress networking over and over (honestly, you'll hear the word networking like it's nobody's business). The Male to Female ratio at this school is 9:1 (yeah, seriously) so one I might suggest for the ladies is the X factor - a group for the women at full sail., 448597=Currently I am taking my courses online through the hybrid program but I will be on Campus for 2013 but from what I've seen the area is ideal., 468731=Well I haven't actually been to Full Sail University yet, I have a tour date on July 15th and a hotel booked for the 14th so I can tour the school and my apartment, and find a job to help pay for everything. But from reading online reviews about Full Sail it is a great school and helps a plethora of people to succeed. I know that I will be successful once I graduate from this school., 1137240=Don't take out any private loans if you don't have to. Take out federal student loans only. But if you can win scholarships and grants, that would be the preferred method to pay for school. Full Sail has professionalism points that apply to both online and offline courses. Everything you write in assignments, discussion posts, and emails-- all of it should be written in a professional, respectful tone. Spelling and grammar counts as part of this as well. Also, if you're taking an accelerated course online, note that this will probably take up 20-40 hours a week, as there is a lot of reading to do on top of research for assignments., 22860=Full Sail is an amazing school that will offer you the finest education for the industry that money can buy (and you will be spending a lot of it). You get out what you're willing to put in, all the resources are there from one on one assistance to the latest equipment and awesome facilities. A note for any girls just so you're aware, Full Sail's Male to Female ratio is 9:1 - we're a rare species here., 754648=There are always activities done throughout the community that Full Sail puts together at different times of the year. There was one back in October of 2012 dealing with I think it was called Breast Cancer awareness, the walk in Lake Eola. Also the different clubs just to name a few Entertainment Networking Society, Creative Student Networking Group, Music Publishing Society, The Record Club and so much more., 298216=A word to the wise. If you are not sure about the field that you may be interested in, don't panic. Full Sail gives you the option of changing your majors with ease. A new semester starts every month, so if you do change your mind you don't have to wait until August to start your new major., 293369=Campus safety can be something of an issue if a student is not well prepared. Such as, with a flash light or a pair of running shoes. Full Sail has classes that go on 24 hours a day. Considering that every student is carrying a $2000 laptop. Not to worry though. The campus security is easily accesible and they're available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They do a great job monitoring the school and its surroundings making sure that students and faculty are safe during all hours of the day everyday., 529430=Although I have not had the chance to attend courses yet, the college looks spectacular. Full Sail seems to be exactly what I'm looking for plus more! I can't wait to start classes in August., 956126=Awesome school for the money. Yes it is a little more than some comparable schools, but what is included to help students with the amount of money that is needed in this school is better than any other school I have ever seen. Added to my tuition was a brand new MacBook Pro and supplemental software that is needed for the class. My package alone was a $6000 computer and software added into my tuition for only $2900. Some classes for example Mobile Development includes new MacBook, iPad and an Android phone for testing and development of mobile apps. Others may include cameras needed for the class also. The software given is awesome too with full versions of Microsoft Office for MAC and the Adobe Creative Suite Master Edition. My business class also included QuickBooks for Business. I am extremely happy with the cost of tuition., 693536=What is the Tuition for your in-State? Also What is the on campus hospitality? And May I be Able to research in a library of great size?, 444359=Full Sail University is an awesome university. I've been studying there since November 2011, and I haven't had any problems since I have been going there. Once I graduate with my first degree, I plan on returning., 765177=This school is quite expensive. I currently owe a loan that I cannot afford. It is due on February 4, 2013. I have currently no money to help pay it off. The money and the cost is well worth going to school here.}",
