            "Campus safety is excellent on campus! Officers regularly patrol the roads and parking lots, and have an excellent respond time. Many emergency booths are found on the main campus and the mountain campus where a button can be pushed and and officer will dispatch to the location.",
            "There are few on campus, but they are available to join.",
            "If there is not a club to suit a students interest, they are encouraged to start their own!",
            "Although all students are welcome and encouraged to tour/attend the college, environmentally conscious students in particular will find Berry appealing for the sustainability projects hosted by the college and the closeness felt to nature.",
            "The college features a castle, built in the 1930s, which serves as classrooms, offices, and dorms for the students. Many other old stone-built structures can be found on the mountain campus, which was the original location of the college. The college greatly honors the founder, Martha Berry, and a yearly Mountain Day is held in honor of her where family is encouraged to attend and feel the family atmosphere and participate in fun events with the students. Marthapalooza is also an annual event that features carnival rides and gives students a break from their hectic college year.",
            "Many people will look at the hefty price tag of the private college and decide against it, when in fact, after all the financial aid and scholarships offered, many students end up paying less than they would at a local community college! Academic scholarships and need based scholarships are offered, and their are many work opportunities to help support students and their tuition bill. The investment is definitely worth the education received!",
            "The campus spans over 26,000 acres so there is no limit to outdoor fun! There are numerous bike, hiking, and horse trails. Hiking to the House of Dreams is a must for any student; the House of Dreams was built by Berry students as a vacation home for the college founder, Martha Berry, at the very plateau of the mountain and features beautiful gardens and views. The 52 acre reservoir that sustains Berry's water needs is also within hiking distance, and although no fishing or swimming is allowed, students can relish the beauty of the environment and even camp in certain locations. Aside from the outdoors, the student activity board plans parties, dances, and other fun campus events weekly. The college is a short distance from downtown Rome where many shops and restaurants are open daily.",
            "Berry's dining hall features healthy and hearty meals. Students with all tastes will find something to their liking, and allergy warnings are posted at every station. Berry has three other dining locations where breakfast, coffee, and lunch can be purchased along with grocery items. A Chic-fil-A restaurant, burger studio, deli, and southwestern style grill are featured too.",
            "As a commuter, I do not have personal experience in the dorms. There are many dorm and townhouse options available and they are continuously updated and renovated. Singles, doubles, and even cottages are used for student housing.",
            "The toughness of courses really depends on the professor. Although Berry holds academic standards, professors are free to decide grading scales and curriculum. Peer learning is encouraged, and the college will always have tutoring options available.",
            "Do not be scared of being in an unfamiliar environment with people you don't know! Being a part of the Berry Bubble means that you will interact regularly with faculty and students and in the process meet great people and friends; the campus really feels like home. The student activity board plans and holds events regularly for the students to have fun on campus and off, so there is never a dull moment.",
            "The beautiful Berry College campus is nestled at the foot of Lavender Mountain and spans over 26000 acres. The liberal arts college provides an excellent array of degree programs, scholarship/grant opportunities, and has one of the nation's top student work programs. With only around 2000 students, class sizes are able to remain small so students can work closely with their peers and advisers relevant to their majors."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{145974=Every August, we have a tradition called Mountain Day. Students will gather on a specific hill on campus dressed in either pink, white, or blue. Pink for underclassmen girls, blue for underclassmen boys, blue for senior girls, and white for senior boys. Students then hold hands and march up and down the hill, dropping pennies in a basket at the bottom of the hill. At the end of the Grand March, the pennies are all donated to charity. Later that night, Berry hosts a Carnival on campus and all students get in for free., 232011=We have a Mountain Day celebration where we celebrate the colleges founding person. We have a big march and lots of festivities. then we have Marthapalooza, a carnival that comes on campus., 282964=Small rooms, some are very old, with large windows and beautiful views. Not many Coeds. (2013 should be the last year of all female dorms)., 313711=The Mountain Day March was amazing to watch. Looking back I wish I had taken part but at the time I thought it was odd., 165451=The biggest tradition on campus is Mountain Day, which is similar to homecoming. The day before is the Mountain Day Olympics, where afternoon classes are cancelled and dorms play against each other. During Mountain Day, parents and alumni are invited back on campus to watch the current students' march down the hill. Each gender in different class years wear different colors and drop pennies based on their age into a basket at the foot of the hill. They go down first in ones, march back up and join hands to march down in twos, then fours, then eights, then sixteens. That night, there will be a carnival called Marthapalooza held in the Clara bowl about six rides or so with various games., 264217=No Greek life. Martha did not believe in greek life. Fall 2014 is the inaugural year for Football!, 265124=First weekend of October, we celebrate Mountain Day (Martha Berry's Birthday). That Friday there is olympics between the 7 dorm areas. Saturday is the traditional walk up the mountain with your fellow classmates, following that night is Marthapalooza, a theme park brought into the Clara Bowl. There are many great locations on campus. On main campus, I would recommend the Ford Buildings. It is very pretty. Remember the Titans was filmed there. The entire campus is beautiful. You can't beat it., 341556=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 90075=Wow, too many to talk about! We have a dairy and lots of cow fields, 26,000 acres covering all of Mount Berry, and historic sites all over. The original water wheel that supplied the early campus all of its water, the old brick factory that was originally used to start the school, and the old chapels and school buildings from the early 1900's. Marthapolooza is a giant fair on campus once a year in order to honor our founder, Martha Berry's, birthday. We do a grand march and parade and we get out of classes that day. It is so much fun., 94214=Berry is a large, outdoorsy campus with a student to deer ratio of 1:3 Classes are very difficult but you learn a lot and you are challenged every day which will help you out in the long run. Every student is offered a job on campus and you can get promoted as well; an RA is a level four job but the head RA is a level 5 job., 113007=The most important tradition, though not really that unusual, is Mountain Day, the Mountain Day Olympics, and Marthapalooza that occurs each year. These events are connected with the celebration of Martha Berry's birthday and occur within the first two weeks of October. For these events, the entire Berry Community comes together to celebrate. This includes faculty, staff, students, alumni, parents, and others who simply live on the Berry College Campus., 28541=WAYYYYY TOOOOOOOOO EXPENSIVE for out of state students. Food is gross and you pay over $2000 for the required meal plan. Dorm rooms are not in good shape. The academics are amazing, so basically the money is worth it for the classes:), 129659=The beautiful Berry College campus is nestled at the foot of Lavender Mountain and spans over 26000 acres. The liberal arts college provides an excellent array of degree programs, scholarship/grant opportunities, and has one of the nation's top student work programs. With only around 2000 students, class sizes are able to remain small so students can work closely with their peers and advisers relevant to their majors., 96514=one of our largest events and tradition on campus is a weekend called mountain day. this is the celebration of our founder's birthday and homecoming all rolled into one. we have mountain day olympics where the dorms compete against each other and against the faculty-staff team. the grand march, up on mountain campus, is a huge deal. the alumni come back and watch the current students carry on the 100 year old tradition of marching up and down the mountain. and our headliner event- marthapoolza, a mini-fair on campus. the whole weekend is always is themed and all the students are super involved., 328714=Berry has this tradition called Mountain Day that has been around since the school was created. It is the founder Martha Berry's birthday and all the students who want to participate wear white, pink and blue, march up and down a hill about 6 or 7 times, and put pennies in a basket. Soooooo.... yeah., 248647=Berry College is the only place where I can leave my $2000 computer, wallet, and iPhone sitting on a table unattended for over a half hour and not worry that someone will take it. Every building has scanners to get into them (including scanners on each hallway).}",
