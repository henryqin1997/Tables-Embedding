The first group they recorded was the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, followed in 1923 by King Oliver\u2019s Creole Jazz Band with young lion Louis Armstrong on second cornet. That same year Gennett waxed a series of solo piano recordings by Jelly Roll Morton. The following year they recorded The Wolverines, a northern group which had been influenced by both the New Orleans Rhythm Kings and King Oliver\u2019s Jazz Band and featured the up-and-coming cornetist Bix Beiderbecke. Another indie company in Chicago, Paramount Records, was competing with Gennett and Okeh for jazz talent.

Included are Duke Ellington\u0092s Cotton Club Orchestra, a youthful Louis Armstrong, Bo Jangles\u0094 Robinson, Bessie Smith\u0092s only screen performance, a rare clip of the Boswell Sisters, the Dorsey Brothers Band, Charlie Wellman, Tessie Maize, Ben Bernie\u0092s Orchestra, Paul Whiteman, and the only appearance of jazz legend Bix Beiderbecke in a sound film as Bix stands up and plays through an ensemble brass passage.

Although commonly referred to as the \u201cJazz Age,\u201d in retrospect the era would be more reasonably named the \u201cDance Age,\u201d as America went crazy for dances like the Charleston and the Black Bottom, and the music they danced to was played by seven- to twelve-piece dance orchestras. In New York, a popular dance orchestra led by pianist Fletcher Henderson had been playing a more ragtime-influenced style of jazz until trumpeter Louis Armstrong joined up in 1925, causing a profound change in the group\u2019s sound. Another New Orleans native, Sidney Bechet, master of the soprano saxophone, caused a similar change in the orchestra of Duke Ellington and subsequently influenced many of the decade\u2019s saxophonists., 46201=Copyright 2005-2012 - JazzStandards.com - All Rights Reserved\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Permission & contact information}",

Based on recordings, jazz musicians in the 1920s were able to perform some original material (and compositions targeted for jazz musicians), but recording company executives wanted popular songs, too.
