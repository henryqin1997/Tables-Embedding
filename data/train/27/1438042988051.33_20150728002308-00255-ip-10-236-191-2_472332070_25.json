They all, however, have one thing in common: liquid flow switches are necessary to monitor and control the flow of water and chemical additives throughout the wastewater treatment system. Flow switches are used at multiple points in water Flow Switches for Refinery Water/Wastewater Control To ensure quality production of petroleum-based products in oil refineries, including gasoline, diesel, kerosene, heating oil, and byproducts for plastics and a variety of lubricants, operators must establish reliable water monitoring and treatment. There are three refinery process areas Liquiphant M Replaces Flow Switch for Water Detection Case Study: Waste Water Management operation is an absolute requirement. All components of the system must have a high MTBF and any and every method of redundancy is taken advantage of to prevent shutdowns or accidents. This is especially true of the Ethernet switches in the network. If the network goes down, the flow stops, or worse. Municipal Water line.
