            "UNLV does a great job making their students feel safe. While waking the campus, one will always find wandering officers or patrol cars, even police officers on horse at times. There are even emergency phone booths and the UNLV Campus Patrol station right across the street.",
            "Greek life is one of the most exciting aspects of college, especially at UNLV. From the week of rush to initiation, no better club gets you involves in your school and acquainted or befriended to so many new people than going Greek.",
            "From fraternities to sororities, academic and non academic, and even major-based clubs, UNLV has an organization for even the quiet students. It is close to impossible to not find a club or organization that works best for you.",
            "Any student looking for an opportunity to meet different people from all over the world and enjoy the perks of going to a large school will feel well suited at UNLV. It gives you the opportunities to meet some of the most fun yet distinguished students from all around the world.",
            "One of the best things about UNLV are it's convenient resting spots. From the amphitheaters outdoors the the second floor of the Student Union that overlooks the entire campus. After a long hard day of classes, it's nice to rest easy somewhere just for a moment.",
            "Based in your choice of major, UNLV is worth the money. It's an exciting and intellectual experience anyone would enjoy. It also possesses some of the best professors I have ever had.",
            "Almost every week of each semester UNLV offers so many opportunities to have fun. From football and basketball games to weekly movie nights. My favorite night is the UNLV Premier where the entire campus gathers and enjoys free food, music, and tons of interaction.",
            "The food and dining offered at UNLV is top notch. Not only do you have guilty indulgences such as Panda Express and Del Taco but healthy options such as Subway ad Greens to go. There is also a dining hall and a small grocery market.",
            "Those who live in dorms have almost twice as great as college experience as those who live off campus. The campus is large enough to enjoy nice log walks and even has a three story gym.",
            "Classes are challenging depending on what you are studying. Be prepared to work as much as you play.",
            "Anyone looking into management, especially hotel management, would be extremely pleased at UNLV. Not only that, but UNLV does know how to get their students involved. The Rebel spirit is very strong and something you'll be proud to brag about.",
            "In my experience at UNLV, I would rate it as an 9 on a scale of 1-10. While socially there are a plethora of opportunities for students to get involved, academically it is evident where they want their students to focus their studies on. I would love to see an even distribution of money to each field offered."

For example, there are a lot of scholarships that can pay for most, if not all, of your tuition. Talk to the financial aid office about grants offered by the school as well as other scholarships awarded by the program you're majoring in. Either way, you will be able to have at least some of your tuition paid off at UNLV., 1058196=Excited to be joining UNLV to study hospitality management with a concentration in PGA Golf. Attended an excellent and well organized orientation in June., 82008=Here is UNLV's shining area. It is cheap. No, it is dirt cheap. That is, if you went to high school in Las Vegas. If you are an out of state student, avoid this school like the plague. However, if you go to a Las Vegas high school and qualify for the Guinn Millennium Scholarship, you will pay only 1500-2500 dollars per semester, which is far below average. In other words, if you are local, have that scholarship, and only care about getting a degree so you can go to grad school, this is the place. But don't expect to have a exceptional learning environment., 27451=I am already enrolled at UNLV to begin my first semester in the Spring of 2011. I have many friends who attended UNLV for the Fall semester & from what I have heard, the classes are packed full of learning experiences. They require much work, focus & concentration. The professors are very knowledgeable on the subjects which they teach, & they are willing help if you get lost. Overall, students at UNLV undoubtedly learn a lot in their time spent at the university., 470645=I feel that they do not support their Geology program very well, There on-campus housing needs to be remodeled. They do not treat everyone equally I know this as I worked in the Enrollment and Student Services office and I was able to see what goes on behind the scenes. I rate them a 4 out of 10 I am currenlty finishing my last semester with UNLV online this fall and starting with Metropolitan College of Denver Spring 2013, 217404=If you are a commuter and willing to stay on campus until 6:30 PM for a meeting, once a month, then I would say the clubs are a great thing. To those living on campus it is definitely more convenient because they are within walking distance., 1060679=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 1023468=There's plenty of people on campus throughout the whole entire day. I have a class that doesn't end until 7:30 at night and there's still plenty of other students walking around campus. However, if there isn't a lot of people around, there are security guards constantly patrolling the campus, and there are emergency call boxes on every corner for students to pick up and it will notify campus police that they need help.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Everyone knows college isn't gonna be easy, its a challenge. There are going to be teachers that only go over the general information in the lecture, leaving it up to you to learn the concepts through the book. But reading the book is required in all classes. There will also be teachers that go more in depth in the lectures, giving you a full understanding of the material before you study on your own. But all courses will offer a study group or tutoring, which is helpful when you don't get anything. Some teachers may have really thick accents, but that will just be another obstacle to overcome. So before you decide on your schedule, I recommend you look up the professor on ratemyprofessor.com, the reviews are usually straight on. Overall, you will learn a lot here, but you're going to have to put the time and effort in.
