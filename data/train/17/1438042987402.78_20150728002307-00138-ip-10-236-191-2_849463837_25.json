In some cases, however, to pass an element such as this, which does have a null value, you must state this explicitly (for example, <X xsi:nil=\"true\"/>).

A sequence value of 1000, for example, means that every record with a sequence less than that value has already been processed. Because many tables have some counter field that is always increasing and maintained by triggers or the application, this strategy can often be used for noninvasive polling.

This section describes the conversion of data types such as CLOB, DATE, TIMESTAMP, and binary data types including RAW, LONG RAW and BLOB, as well as similar data types supported by third-party databases. 9.7.4.2 Data Type Conversions <X xsi:nil=\"true\"/>  To specifically assign a null value to X when the type of X is user-defined, add the xsi:nil attribute to the element in the XML file, as in X := OBJ(NULL, NULL, NULL);  Similarly, in the preceding OBJECT example, an initialized instance of OBJ, whose attribute values have all been null assigned, is bound to X. Similar to the VARRAY case, this is equivalent to calling the type constructor. For example, X := ARRAY();  In the preceding VARRAY example, if <X/> or <X></X> is specified, then the value bound to X is an empty instance of the VARRAY. In PL/SQL, this is equivalent to calling the type constructor and assigning the value to X. For example, The second case, <X/>, behaves differently if the type of X is user-defined. Rather than assigning null to X, an",
    "textAfterTable": "For a CLOB parameter, if the length of the CLOB parameter is less than 4 kilobytes, then the text extracted from the XML file is bound to the parameter as a String type with no further processing. If the length of the CLOB parameter is greater than 4 kilobytes or if the mode of the parameter is IN/OUT then a temporary CLOB parameter is created. The XML file data is then written to the temporary CLOB before the CLOB is bound to its corresponding parameter. The temporary CLOB parameter is freed when the interaction completes. For other character types, such as CHAR and VARCHAR2, the data is simply extracted and bound as necessary. Note that it is possible to bind an XML document to a CLOB parameter (or VARCHAR2 if it is large enough). However, appropriate substitutions for <, >, and so on, must first be made (for example, &lt; for < and &gt; for >). A few data types require special processing before their values are bound to their corresponding parameters. These include data types represented by the XML Schema types base64Binary and dateTime. Note that the XML schema type, dateTime, represents TIME, DATE, and TIMESTAMP. This means that the XML values for these data types must adhere to the XML schema representation for dateTime. Therefore, a simple DATE string, 01-JAN-05, is invalid. XML schema defines dateTime as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss. Therefore, the correct DATE value is 2005-01-01T00:00:00.
