The highest deposition rate was achieved at 630\ufffd C. with a rate of 67 \u212b/sec. The final vacuum pressure was raised to 1.0\ufffd10\u22124 torr., 123984=Trial 3 was run with Elvacite 2045, an isobutyl methacrylate with a molecular weight of 193,000. The deposition rose as high as 26.5 \u212b/sec at a temperature of 500\ufffd C. At this temperature the vacuum pressure had risen to 3.6\ufffd10\u22124 torr from a starting pressure of 5.2\ufffd10\u22125 torr., 127822=Trials 22 and 26 were run with Elvacite 2697, a treated version of a methyl/n-butyl methacrylate copolymer. The molecular weight of this material was 60,000. The Elvacite 2697 had a final deposition rate of 20 \u212b/sec at a temperature of 580\ufffd C. Vacuum pressure rose to 1.0\ufffd10\u22124 torr at the end of the trial., 129849=Trial 29 was run with Kraton G1780. This material is a multiarm copolymer of 7% styrene and ethylene/propylene. Deposition reached a high of 70 \u212b/sec at a temperature of 600\ufffd C. The final vacuum pressure rose to 8.2\ufffd10\u22125 torr. During the trial, the deposition rate held very steady and did not exhibit wild fluctuation that is common in all of the other trials, especially at higher temperatures., 69525=The process of this invention enables production of reflective flakes at high production speeds and low cost. The uncoated flakes produced by this invention can have a high aspect ratio. Where aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of particle size to thickness, and the average flake size is approximately 6 microns by 200 Angstroms (one micron=10,000 Angstroms) the aspect ratio 60,000/200 is or about 300:1. This high aspect ratio is comparable to the Metalure flakes described previously. For the embodiments in which flakes are coated on both sides with protective layers, the aspect ratio of these flakes is approximately, 60,000/600 or about 100:1., 127456=Trial 21 was run with Elvacite 2009, a methyl methacrylate polymer treated to contain no sulfur. The molecular weight of this material was 83,000. A final deposition rate of 26 \u212b/sec was reached at a temperature of 580\ufffd C. The vacuum pressure had risen to 1.8\ufffd10\u22124 torr from an initial reading of 4.2\ufffd10\u22125 torr., 130596=Trial 31 was run with Kraton G1702. This is a linear diblock polymer of 28% styrene and ethylene/propylene. A final deposition rate of 91 \u212b/sec was reached at 580\ufffd C. The vacuum pressure had risen to 8.0\ufffd10\u22125 torr at this condition., 94363=This invention makes it possible to produce thin decorative and functional platelets of single or multilayer materials with thickness from about 5 to about 500 angstroms single layer, from about 10 to 2000 angstroms multilayer, with average outer dimensions from about 0.01 to 150 micrometers. The flakes or particles made by the process of this invention are referred to as angstrom scale particles because they are useful flake material that can be made with a thickness in the low angstrom range mentioned above. Some particles made by this invention can be characterized as nanoscale particles. As is well known, 10 angstroms equals one nanometer (nm), and the nanoscale range is generally from one to 100 nm. Thus, some of the angstrom scale particles (thickness and/or particle size) of this invention fall within the nanoscale range., 26276=This application is a division of application Ser. No. 09/849,512, filed May 4, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,863,851 which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09/425,514, filed Oct. 22, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,398,999, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/105,399, filed Oct. 23, 1998., 131147=Trial 33 was run with 1201 Creanova, a synthetic resin based on a urethane modified ketone aldehyde. This material achieved a deposition rate of 382 \u212b/sec at a temperature of 535\ufffd C. At this temperature there was minimal impact on the vacuum., 161547=Relative Refractive Index used: 2.64-2.88, 129594=Trial 28 was run with Elvacite 2043, an ethyl methacrylate polymer with a molecular weight of 50,000. At 600\ufffd C., the deposition rate was at 98 \u212b/sec. At this condition, the vacuum pressure was at 1.0\ufffd10\u22124 torr., 128548=Trial 24 was run with Lawter K1717, a polyketone. A maximum deposition rate of 300 \u212b/sec was reached at 300\ufffd C. At this temperature the vacuum pressure had risen to 7.0\ufffd10\u22125 torr. At the end of the trial, a great deal of soot remained in the crucible. This indicated that some of the material had actually combusted rather than just being evaporated., 124315=The fourth trial used Elvacite 2044, which is an n-butyl methacrylate material with a molecular weight of 142,000. Deposition for the 2044 reached a peak of 30 \u212b/sec at 500\ufffd C. At this temperature the vapor pressure reached 2.0\ufffd10\u22124 torr., 129284=Trial 27 was run with Elvacite 2016, a non-treated methyl/n-butyl methacrylate copolymer. This has a molecular weight of 61,000. At 630\ufffd C., the deposition rate reached 135 \u212b/sec. At this condition, the vacuum pressure had been significantly raised to 3.0\ufffd10\u22124 torr., 232196=The GPC instrument was a Waters 2690 pumping system with a Waters 410 refractive index detector. The columns were three P1gel Mixed-C 300 mm\ufffd7.5 from Polymer Labs. The mobile phase was THF at 1.0 mL/min. The injection size was 50 \u03bcL. Calibration was against a set of twelve polystyrene standards obtained from Polymer Labs, ranging from 580 to 1,290,000 Da. Millennium version 3.2 software from Waters was used with the GPC option. Calibration was done daily and a check sample of SRM 706 polystyrene from the National Institute for Standards and Technology was also analyzed daily with each batch of samples., 250674=Further test data revealed an MVTR of 1.2 for small particles, a 5:1 pigment-to-binder ratio and a coat weight of 5 gm/m2., 130289=Trial 30 was run with Kraton G1701. This material is a linear diblock polymer of 37% styrene and ethylene/propylene. An ultimate deposition rate of 102 \u212b/sec was reached at a temperature of 595\ufffd C. The vacuum pressure was at 8.6\ufffd10\u22125 torr at this final condition.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Other uses of nanoparticles are described in Handbook of Deposition Technologies for Films and Coatings, \u201cNucleation, Film Growth, and Microstructural Evolution,\u201d Joseph Green, Noyes Publication (1994). By running the release-coated carrier at a high rate of speed, deposited metal such as aluminum will produce discrete islands (nano-particles described above). These particles (when removed from the release layer) can be blended in a flake containing film, or used as-is in a polymeric film. The nano-particle containing film can increase electrical capacitance. Capacitance is proportional to dielectric constant and area and inversely proportioned to the separation distance between the capacitor plates. Nano-particles dispersed between larger particle size flakes raise the dielectric constant and therefore the capacitance. Electrical Applications Based on these data, applications for angstrom scale particles (thickness of less than about 100 angstroms and particles size of less than about 20 microns) for example, may include moisture transmission barrier materials. In use, the flakes line up in parallel in an essentially common plane and produce barriers to water molecules passing through the flake-containing film. Flakes, such as glass flakes, for example, can be used in polymeric films such as PVC, to inhibit plasticizer migration. The data show that additions of properly selected flakes can have a dramatic effect on MVTR. For example, the table shows a decrease of the MVTR of a nylon film from 75 g/m2-day to 1.8 g/m2-day with",
