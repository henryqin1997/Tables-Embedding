            "I feel safe at UConn. Every street and every corner is lit up by an emergency pole. These emergency pole's have alerting buttons that call our on-campus police/security and respond immediately. We also have a shuttle system, bussing students from one side of campus to the other. On the weekends various Sober Ride cars make rounds bringing students back to their dorms safely, intoxicated or not. UConn has a fantastic safety program and I couldn't feel safer anywhere else.",
            "Greek life is very big at UConn, but it isn't the most important thing. Greek life here offers a family oriented college life and is very social and popular. But it isn't to say that if you aren't in Greek life you wont meet anyone or do anything fun. Most students are not in Greek life and still have amazing experiences here.",
            "You find what you look for. Here at UConn there is a club for almost anything. And in the rare case that you don't find that club, you are more than welcome to start it. Even so, the clubs here are well organized and very welcoming of new members.",
            "The University of Connecticut is good for anyone who would like to try something new. It is definitely beginner friendly. I had never rock climbed before, and the students in the rock climbing club were very friendly and open for helping me learn. I feel as though my friends and I have all gotten great opportunities to try things we usually wouldn't, and it seems to be an on-campus habit.",
            "Horsebarn Hill is located behind the famous UConn Dairy Bar (home of some of the greatest ice cream ever). This hill is fantastic for sledding, star gazing, and just has one of the best views of the campus itself.",
            "As I've mentioned, UConn is a great bang for your buck. Not only do you get the same value education as you would in an Ivy League but you have better options as well. There are a lot of exchange opportunities making study abroad much more affordable then you'd think. On top of that we have a fantastic meal plan and great deals with student prices for travel, shopping, and events.",
            "UConn has over 500 student organizations, and if you can't find something for you all you need is 8 people to start something new! But really, there will probably be something for you. UConn does a fantastic job at giving it's students opportunities to try something new, from Late Night (weekend activities every Friday and Saturday) to movies, marathons, adventure races, Improv shows, concerts, and many opportunities to travel.",
            "On-campus students must have meal plans. These meal plans are very much affordable and worth it! With 7 dining halls multiple cafes and grab and go (subs/wrap) spots UConn has solved on-campus hunger! Students are given unlimited swipes to dining halls, points to use in cafes and restaurants, and even flex passes to bring in guests to our dining halls. The best part is that the food is delicious, and very friendly to allergenic, vegan, and organic specialties.",
            "The University of Connecticut has been around for a long time, needless to say a lot of the buildings here are older. But the University has done a fantastic job upgrading these buildings to maintain comfortable and nice Residence Halls. With our Co-Generation Plant we never lose heat or energy, even in the worst of storms, because we produce our own electricity and heat.",
            "All of UConn's faculty are top of the line PhD, thus more than qualified for the job. We get incredible education and even more incredible opportunities to challenge ourselves.",
            "Ask students on-campus what they like to do with the University of Connecticut. It will surprise you when you hear the amazing places and activities we have from rock climbing with the outing club to adventuring with the sky diving club.",
            "The University of Connecticut is diverse, from a fantastic school of engineering to an inspirational music department, anyone can find their place here. UConn is also beautiful, it has the right balance of nature and structure with modern buildings and rolling hills. Lastly, UConn is a big bang for your buck, with top of the line meal plans and a great education for a good price."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{851784=The rigor of the academics depends on the college and program that you are enrolled in. Many courses on campus are graded through multiple choice exams, especially entry-level or 1000 level courses. This excludes examinations in quantitative (Q) classes and writing (W) classes. You have to study to succeed. It is not necessary to study your notes every day (for most courses at least), but allow one must allow themselves plenty of time before exams to review material. Two days of studying is not going to earn the average student an A., 404431=The woods have trails that lead to interesting things. The best tradition was Spring Weekend. It's a big block party at Carriage on Thursday, one in Celeron on Friday and another in X-lot on Saturday. This is usually done on the last weekend before the last week of class. It has been suspended by the administration but it will resurface this 2012-13 year. Learn the UConn chants at football and basketball games. Attend Late-Night at least once. Go to Horsebarn Hill to hang out and watch a beautiful sunrise or sunset., 834708=UConn is a large school with a lot of options and possibilities for all their students. Although it is located in a rural area, almost everything a student may need is within walking distance either on campus or in the newly built Storrs Center. Not only is it an academically competitive school, but, don't forget, we are also the 2014 dual champions for college basketball!, 406752=South Dining Hall is the best. Towers is really good and has Kosher and Halal. The North and Northwest Dining Halls are good and have a good stir fry bar. East is not bad and Putnam is mediocre. McMahon is good from 7:30PM to 10PM. I like to research the menu so I know where to eat. On days when there is Pasta Bar or Stir Fry Bar, get there early because the lines will be huge this year!, 866248=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73686=Depends where you are. West campus? Not so great. South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year. Off campus housing is available also, but a lot of the places near campus are sometimes the party central of the weekends, so you have to be careful with that if it isn't your thing, 758562=Some schools only require 2 continuous years of highschool language but Uconn requires 3 so make sure you come in with that otherwise you'll be taking 2 semesters here. If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question. Students know the most :), 393713=There are many challenging classes for one biology 1107., 263407=UConn has over 300 clubs and societies on and off campus. UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility. Filling out the housing application and returning the deposit as soon as possible is a good idea., 95228=The Parade-Parade along with Homecoming in October when there's a king and a queen chosen., 591956=2013 was the first year for the underwear mile run, they have an oozeball tournament every year, it is mud volleyball basically., 494101=The food isn't all too great. There are lots of dining hall options based on location, however you need to find the one you like best. On the down side most of them have weird hours (Towers Dining Hall closes at 7:15, where others are open until 10. Also they open at 10am on weekends and I find myself starving to death if I wake up early). Get a good meal plan, because the places that require Husky Bucks and Points happen to be the better food options, and they're super convenient to have in the Union.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Academic Rigor The classes are on a whole new level compared to high school. Although the whole college experience will take some time to get used to, the classes provide a way for students to explore what they love most. Much of our homework and studies are done through online companion websites, so we don't have to lug heavy books around, just notebooks and writing utensils or laptops. Also, professors and the TA's have office hours to help any students with classes, we have a library for studying as well as the Q Center, which is very helpful for students who need to brush up on their math and quantitative skills or just understand a concept in math they've never learned before. At UConn, there is a lot of help provided for students if they just know where to look.
