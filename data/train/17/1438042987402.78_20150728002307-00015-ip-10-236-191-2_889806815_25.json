Compare that to regular university prices, which go from $5000 to $10000 a semester, all for the exact same general education classes! It's pretty much a no-brainer. I don't regret my decision at all, because while everyone's in debt, I'll be enjoying that money saved., 302105=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 80308=The school has a decent sized cafeteria. They offer many different items ranging from pizza to burgers. They even sell energy drinks and have many coffee stands throughout the campus which is a plus for me since i'm there from 7:30 a.m to 4:00 p.m.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here It's a clean, safe environment, but because everyone commutes it's obviously missing that college experience of dorming and close knit feeling. Regardless, everyone's friendly and in the same situation as you, so you feel completely at ease. The class schedules are so flexible, I take all of my classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8am-3pm. I love those 4 day weekends! Am learning a lot The classes are small, 30 students max. This makes for great communication between you and the professor (no teacher assistants here!). All of my teachers are excited to teach each day, and make the material exciting (even math). I don't believe that a community college offers less quality education. I'm getting a lot out of the classes I've taken.
