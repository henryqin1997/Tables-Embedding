    "textBeforeTable": "Advanced Catching Metrics No BP Roundtables have mentioned this guy. BP Roundtables Well, he ain't gonna hit .400, and you'd do well to remember Jazayerli's Law of Backup Catchers: given enough chances, a guy will have a season in which he hits .300 in less than 200 at-bats. I'm skeptical he's got a future as a major league starter, but he's certainly no Wil Nieves, and may well turn out to be the best backup the Yanks have had in a long time. I'd trade him for Johnny Damon, though. (Jay Jaffe) Is Cervelli for real? Do the Yanks regret not resigning Matsui/Damon? (Paul from Boston) 2010-05-14 13:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) As you know, Chris Coste is out for the year, and they've pressed Jamie Burke up to Syracuse to get him back in gear ASAP. And last I heard, Jesus Flores hasn't even tried to catch yet in his slow rehab. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a mercy-minded swap get made if Burke can't be ready in time, but it reflects an interesting industry-wide issue: the lack of readily available free talent",
