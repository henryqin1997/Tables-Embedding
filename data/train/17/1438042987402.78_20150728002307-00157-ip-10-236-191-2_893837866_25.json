            "We have a designated Student Activity Hour, so that many of the students and faculty can attend, without missing class. There are Sorority and Fraternity Clubs, Poetry, Art, Music, Religious, Multicultural, Ethnic, Women-focused, Law, Hip-Hop, Jazz and Journalism Clubs, literary magazines and newspapers, Student Union, Student Leadership, Study Abroad/Scholarship programs, a full-sized, well-equipped gym, with a pool, a Ping Pong table and a Rock-climbing Wall, Art Exhibits, themed parties/events off-campus, conferences and keynote speakers. There are too many clubs/organizations for me to list.",
            "It's great for any student interested in attending, even Senior Citizens. I like the diversity of the university.",
            "If you have trouble finding a club to join or something to do at this school, then you're not looking. From Bake Sales to movies, Talent Shows to Art Exhibits, poetry to theatrical productions...there is something for everyone. I joined my schoolmates IN the 83rd Annual Bud Billiken Parade, this year.",
            "There are vending machines all over campus, in nearly every building. There is a Subway restaurant, in addition to another restaurant that serves a small variety of meal choices, along with sandwiches and desserts. The school bookstore also sells a nice variety of drinks and snack food, including a selection of healthy cookies that taste rather good.",
            "I don't live on campus, so I cannot rate it fairly.",
            "I'm still learning about my school, but so far, the expectations are the same across the board...a solid education you can be proud of. To help every student be successful, the University has several programs in place, for those who want, or need, it.",
            "Every college student should know what Credits you already have, what and how many Credits you WILL need, and which Credits will transfer to another program or school. Check this out for yourself, in addition to working with an Academic Advisor. Also, check to see what work experience or training you already have, that includes volunteer work AND high school courses and activities, that you may be able to get college credit for...less classes taken, less money spent.",
            "NEIU was recently rated one of the cheapest 4-year universities to attend. NEIU is very active in the community. NEIU has a LOT of student-centered activities available and it has been a great experience for me."

The school is one of the cheapest forms of higher education in the Chicago land area. Recently it was ranked amongst the highest schools with the less amount of graduates leaving without debt. Am enjoying being here Student life at NEIU is complicated as the school is a commuter school. Needless to say many friendly people attended this university and there\u2019s always something to get involved in. Am learning a lot Northeastern Illinois University is filled with delightful professors that go beyond the basic expectations in helping student\u2019s succeed in their classes. All of my professors have flexible offer hours, and tutors are available free of charge by the university in the library.",
