    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{55985=Prostaglandins as a class of compounds have diverse pharmacologic activity, including stimulation of gastrointestinal and reproductive smooth muscle, relaxation and contraction of respiratory smooth muscle, hypotensive activity, inhibition of fatty acid lipolysis, inhibition of blood platelet aggregation, and inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therapeutic utility of prostaglandins in general is correspondingly broad. As for prostaglandin E1(\u201cPGE1\u201d)in particular, this compound, salts thereof, and lower alkyl esters thereof are well known and disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,069,322 (Bergstrom et al.), 5,219,885 (Froelich et al.) and in J. Org. Chem. 1974, 37, 2921. PGE1 has found utility in the treatment of peripheral occlusive diseases, acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, acute ischemic stroke, asthma, gastrointestinal ulcers, ulcers of the skin, and organ rejection. Various routes of administration have been described, including oral, intravenous, buccal, rectal, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, and sublingual. The preferred route of administration of PGE1 will of course be dependent on the particular intended therapeutic use., 59621=In about the 1960s, prostaglandins were isolated from a particular species of Caribbean coral, which made them more widely available for research. Catanzarite, Valerian A. and Gary Aisenbrey, Contemporary OB/GYN (October 1987), p. 22. A large number of natural and synthetic analogues of the prostaglandins are now known. Lehninger at 687., 238551=The results of analysis of the raw data of Table 14 are presented in Table 15, below, where statistical significance at the p<0.05 level is designated by \u201c*\u201d and at the p<0.01 level by \u201c**\u201d. All statistical analysis of the difference between the mean baseline value and the mean maximum response were performed by paired t test with two-tailed P value as described in Bancroft, H.; 1957, Introduction to Biostatistics, 172-182., 102005=The semi-solid composition of the present invention has a suitably chosen viscosity such that the composition is naturally retained where applied. The semi-solid composition can exhibit Newtonian or non-Newtonian Theological characteristics. In some preferred embodiments, the semi-solid composition of the present invention exhibits non-Newtonian rheological characteristics, i.e. in which the apparent viscosity is dependent on the shear rate applied to the composition. Preferably the composition has \u201cshear-thinning\u201d rheological properties. As used herein, \u201cshear-thinning\u201d refers to a reduction in apparent viscosity (the ratio of shear stress to the shear rate) with increasing shear rate, whether the reduction in apparent viscosity is time independent (pseudoplastic), time dependent (thixotropic) or associated with a yield stress, defined as a stress that must be exceeded before flow starts, (Bingham plastics and generalized Bingham plastics). See, generally, Harris, J., & Wilkinson, W. L., \u201cNon-newtonian Fluid,\u201d pp.856-858 in Parker, S. P., ed., McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Physics, Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1993. Suitable viscosity ranges from about 5,000 centipoise (cps) to about 20,000 cps, preferably from about 7,000 cps to about 13,000 cps., 138862=After signing the informed consent, at screening (Visit 1), the subjects underwent an adaptation session in the sexual response assessment laboratory. This session was intended to allow the patient to become familiar and comfortable with the procedures that will be carried out at subsequent visits. A complete medical history (including the Sexual Activity Questionnaire and the Brief Index of Sexual Function for Women (BISF-W; Taylor, J. F., et al., Self-report assessment of female sexual function: psychometric evaluation of the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women. Arch Sexual Behavior: 23: 627-643, 1994.)) were collected. All medications taken by the patient were be recorded. Baseline safety assessments included ECG, physical exam (including pelvic exam), clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs. Subjects who met all inclusion and no exclusion criteria continued in the study., 64253=Topical and transdermal administration of PGE1 and PGE1 derivatives have also been described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,889,845 (Ritter et al.), 4,515,810 (Chow et al.), and 5,219,885 (Froelich et al.) and in Japanese Kokai 2-264725 (Morimoto et al.) and 63-135333 (Nakano et al.). In order for a transdermal formulation of PGE1 or a derivative thereof to be effective and suitable it is desirable that the formulation have a high transdermal flux rate, allowing a therapeutically effective blood level of the drug to be achieved or maintained when the formulation is applied to a relatively small area of the skin. Furthermore PGE1 readily undergoes certain reactions and rearrangements (see. e.g., J. Chromatography, 1991, 555, 73 (Lee et al.). This instability of the prostaglandin can be problematic in providing a suitable transdermal formulation., 34887=This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09/208,965, filed Dec. 10, 1998, now issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,486,207, which is related to International Application No. PCT/US99/29471, filed Dec. 10, 1999, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety., 57208=Prostaglandins are well known to those skilled in the art. This class of drugs includes those derivatives of prostanoic acid (5-octylcyclopentaneheptanoic acid) referred to as A-I series prostaglandins. Prostaglandin nomenclature is well known and disclosed, e.g., in page 409, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, 1990, A. R. Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. The term \u201cprostaglandin\u201d as used generically herein refers to the prostaglandin free acid and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, including PGE1, PGA1, PGB1, PGF1\u03b1, 19-hydroxy-PGA1, 19-hydroxy-PGB1, PGE2, PGA2, PGB2, 19-hydroxy-PGA2, 19-hydroxy-PGB2, PGE3, PGF3\u03b1, carboprost tromethamine, dinoprost tromethamine, dinoprostone, lipoprost, gemeprost, metenoprost, sulprostone and tiaprost as well as salts and esters thereof. Preferred prostaglandins for use in the formulations of this invention include those prostaglandins comprising a \u03b2-hydroxyketone moiety, including D-series and E-series prostaglandins, preferably E-series prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E1, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts and lower alkyl esters thereof (the term \u201clower alkyl\u201d as used herein means straight chain or branched chain alkyl containing one to four carbon atoms). Of the lower alkyl esters, the ethyl ester of prostaglandin E1(commercially available from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo., and preparable as disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,885, incorporated herein by reference) is preferred., 132347=Sheep vaginas were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. The freshly excised organ was refrigerated and used immediately. After excision, the outer wall of the vagina was carefully separated from any adhering tissue, taking care to avoid damage. The vagina was cut open longitudinally (vertically) (Kabadi, M. B., and Chien, Y. W., Intravaginal controlled administration of Flurogestone acetate. II: Development of an in vitro system for studying the intravaginal release and permeation of Flurogestone acetate, J. Pharm. Sci. 73: 1464-1468 (1984)). The vaginal mucosa were separated from the interior of the vaginal wall, soaked in nanopure water, cut into appropriately sized pieces, and mounted in using modified Franz-type diffusion cells as described in Example 2.}",
