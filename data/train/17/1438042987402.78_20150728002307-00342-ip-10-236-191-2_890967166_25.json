Created for the Middlesex veterinarian college, Brandeis incorporated it into the campus when the school was founded in 1948., 190472=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 95033=Well, the dorms in North quad are amazing (especially Gordon and Sheffres), as are senior housing (Ridgewood) and Mid year housing (The Village). The rest are pretty iffy - it gets really hot without air conditioning, but thats only in September basically., 53419=In 2013, Brandeis changed dining providers from Aramark to Sodexo. The latter has so far provided a variety of dining choices to students, and returning students have said that the food is by far better than previous years'. Freshmen don't complain as food is often tasty. If there is any issue, it would be the lack of variety in the Sherman Dining Hall (All-you-care-to-eat services) -- however this is usually resolved by alternating between dining locations as they all provide their different tastes!}",

    "textAfterTable": "In three sentences Brandeis is an all inclusive school with everything a student could wish for. Busting at the seams with student diversity, clubs of all kinds, and professors that you can approach at almost any time, the smaller community of Brandeis University is perfect for those who want to do it all. The opportunities for study and involvement in the campus and surrounding community are immense, and you will never have a moment where you find yourself without options of entertainment or participation in the school or the surrounding area.
