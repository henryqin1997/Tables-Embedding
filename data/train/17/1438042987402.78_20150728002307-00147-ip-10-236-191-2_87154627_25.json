Rydia comes to consider the Eidolons Asura and Leviathan her family, and even introduces them as her parents to Cuore. Rydia feels rejected and saddened when the two refuse to let her live in the Feymarch with them., 20003=They find their way back into the Tower of Babil beyond the Cave of Eblan but though they reach the chamber holding the seven Crystals, they fall through a trapdoor and escape when a second airship, the Falcon, is discovered. Arriving back in the Underworld, the party reports to King Giott of the dwarves, who allows them to secure the last Dark Crystal in the Sealed Cave before Golbez can have a chance. While in the Underworld the party can choose to visit the Feymarch and challenge Asura and Leviathan to gain their help as Eidolons for Rydia., 9152=Feeling that Rydia should be with her kind, Asura bars Rydia from returning to Feymarch so she would remain with her human friends. Seventeen years later, Rydia is busy helping rebuild the village of Mist, having been assisted by Cecil, Edward, Yang, and Edge on behalf of their kingdoms. A gravestone has been placed for her mother, which reads \"Here lies the motherly summoner who protected our village.\" Rydia pays a visit to the Feymarch only to find that the Eidolons have been petrified., 24863=Leviathan took Rydia to the Feymarch, the home of all Eidolons, where time moves faster, so while Cecil and his allies are separated from Rydia for only a short period of time, years go past in the Feymarch, and, under Leviathan's watchful eye, Rydia grows into a young woman. She hones her skills as a Summoner and develops her powers with Black Magic, although at the cost of no longer casting White Magic. The Queen of the Eidolons, Asura, tells Rydia about the danger Golbez is placing the world in, and Rydia leaves the Feymarch and returns to Cecil to help him., 13268=After roughly a year since Zeromus's defeat, Cecil has a dream foreshadowing the future, where Rydia is bathed in the Crystal's light at the Sealed Cave before falling unconscious. An unknown voice calls out, \"Finally, it has a new form\". Cecil awakens and leaves for the celebration of Damcyan Castle's reconstruction, while Rydia is granted Asura's permission at the Feymarch to visit the event, which she is not seen attending. After visiting Damcyan and taking a detour at Fabul, Cecil's party is sent to the Sealed Cave to inspect a swarm of monsters, where they find Rydia lying at the crystal altar. Rydia comes around and says she cannot remember where she was, and speaks cryptically, telling Cecil's party \"they\" were calling her., 14166=After peace is brought to the world, Rydia returns to the Feymarch, and attends Cecil and Rosa's wedding and coronation. When an Eidolon asks her why they differ in appearance from humans, she states what she had learned from Cecil, that it is one's inner character that matters the most.}",
