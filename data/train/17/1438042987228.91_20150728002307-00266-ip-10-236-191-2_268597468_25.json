            "Analysis",
            "Well, it\u2019s all come down to one week for a team shooting at a three-peat. The Tide cruised through a bye week (Vs Chattanooga) and now the Iron Bowl, versus Auburn. Alabama\u2019s instate rival had the week off to prepare, and this should be one for the ages. The stakes? Winner goes to the SEC Championship game.",
            "After a week filled with off the field controversy, Florida State was lucky to have Idaho on the schedule \u2013 a game they won 80-14. The problem; those off field issues aren\u2019t going anywhere. The good news? FSU gets Florida this week, a team coming off a loss to Georgia Southern.",
            "The chips continue to fall, and Ohio State is left hoping for a lucky break. Oregon went down, then Baylor; now a potential Jameis Winston suspension? The Buckeyes have to get through Michigan in the Big House, then Michigan State in the Big 10 Championship game \u2013 but they have to feel good about their chances with all the turmoil surrounding the team ranked one spot ahead of them.",
            "Arguably the most impressive win of the college football season happened Saturday night in Stillwater \u2013 OK State beat down Baylor 49-17. I wasn\u2019t a huge believer in Baylor, but it\u2019s hard to knock a performance like that. One more win for the Cowboys (over rival Oklahoma) and they\u2019re Big 12 Champs, playing in the Fiesta Bowl.",
            "Clemson was irrelevant this past weekend, like they\u2019ve been since that devastating loss to Florida State \u2013 beating The Citadel 52-6. The Tigers play South Carolina this weekend, with a BCS berth on the line.",
            "If I told you before the season, Auburn would control their destiny to play in the SEC Title game and potentially the Natty, going into the Iron Bowl \u2013 would you believe me? I know I wouldn\u2019t. But that\u2019s how big the stakes are this Saturday, against #1 Alabama. A win for the Tigers, and they head to Atlanta, and possibly LA.",
            "Missouri continues to control their own destiny to reach the SEC Championship game, but they need one more win to get there. The Tigers knocked off Ole Miss, 24-10 in Oxford, now they get a pissed off Texas A&M and Johnny Manziel. Good luck.",
            "All they do is win, win, win\u2026 Michigan State won again Saturday, beating Northwestern 30-6, clinching a spot in the Big 10 Championship game in the process. The Spartans close at home against Minnesota this weekend.",
            "Welp, the wheels sure came off Baylor Saturday night. An offense that couldn\u2019t be stopped all year, came to a screeching halt (sound familiar, Duck fans?) against Oklahoma State. Only thing left for the Bears to do is beat TCU on the road, and hope for an at large bid to a BCS game.",
            "Talk about a bounce back, Stanford took their USC frustrations out on Cal 63-13 Saturday. More importantly, the Pac-12 North game of \u201chot potato\u201d finally ended with Stanford on top, after Oregon fell at Arizona. The Cardinal face Notre Dame this weekend, before they play Arizona State in the Pac-12 Title game.",
            "South Carolina continued their push to upend Missouri in the SEC East, but they need a Tiger loss this weekend if they want to make a trip to Atlanta. The Gamecocks beat Coastal Carolina 70-10, and face instate rival Clemson this weekend.",
            "Your Pac-12 South Champion: Arizona State. It was a wild one in LA Saturday night, the Sun Devils blew a huge lead but eventually beat UCLA 38-33 to punch a ticket to the first Pac-12 Title game in school history. ASU closes with Arizona this weekend, a team fresh off an upset over Oregon.",
            "Well, didn\u2019t see this one coming. Oregon was flat out embarrassed, humiliated, punched in the mouth (whatever analogy you want to use) in a 42-16 loss to Arizona. For the first time in four years, the Ducks will not be playing in a BCS game. Hard to let that sink in, if you\u2019re a Duck fan. There\u2019s not enough room to give an opinion on that turd sandwich, listen to GameNight this week.",
            "For the second year in a row, LSU remains the only defense that somehow, someway slowed down Johnny Football. 34-10 was the final, a huge win over Texas A&M for Les Miles.",
            "USC played Colorado, no one watched, and one 47-29. The Trojans end the season with UCLA at the Coliseum, will a win make Ed Orgeron the next head coach?",
            "I would like to say Johnny Manziel can kiss his Heisman hopes goodbye, after his 3rd loss of the season, but it appears no one wants to win the award this year. Sadly, even with three losses, if Manziel can beat Missouri this weekend \u2013 you have to think he still has a shot.",
            "Oklahoma won at Kansas State 41-31 this Saturday, bringing up a huge matchup against Oklahoma State this weekend.",
            "Wisconsin has struggled with perception problems all season, and it\u2019s crazy to think how different that perception would be if they didn\u2019t screwed at Arizona State. Nonetheless, the Badgers won again this weekend, 20-7 at Minnesota. Wisconsin closes with Penn State at home this weekend.",
            "Central Florida continued their push to an automatic BCS bid, with a 41-17 win over Rutgers. They face South Florida on Friday.",
            "The dream season continues for the Dukies, after a 28-21 win over Wake Forrest \u2013 the Blue Devils area now just one win away from an appearance in the ACC Title game. The team standing in the way; instate rival North Carolina.",
            "Fresno State hopes they bolstered their bid for a BCS game with a 69-28 win over New Mexico. Not only are they battling themselves, they\u2019re also battling Northern Illinois for a higher ranking. The Bull Dogs are at San Jose State Friday.",
            "Jordan Lynch is a stud. That is all. Northern Illinois won again, this time 35-17 at Toledo, they play 1-10 Western Michigan Thursday night.",
            "Louisville won\u2026. Ah, who cares.",
            "Poor UCLA. The Bruins have had a fantastic season in Jim Mora\u2019s 2nd year, but couldn\u2019t knock off a top notch opponent. After a 38-33 loss to Arizona State, all three of UCLA\u2019s losses have come to teams ranked 13th or higher in the BCS. They get the Trojans this weekend, in the battle for LA.",
            "She loves me, she loves me not. Notre Dame (for the 4th time) squeezes back in the Dirty Poll after a win over BYU Saturday. The Irish get Stanford, on the road, this weekend."
