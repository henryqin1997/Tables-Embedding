Be open to change and keep the future in mind! If you haven't visited yet, take a tour of the campus! Visit the department in which you are planning on majoring in. Make sure you are ready to be fully immersed in a Christian environment. Start looking out for sales on things you might need for college and start buying over summer so it's not stressful once you get to school! Read the ENTIRE code of conduct, housing rules, and just be prepared for what is expected of you once you get to APU. Make sure to register for classes as early as possible and ask your academic advisor as many questions as you need in order to be prepared for the year! Stay in contact with your admissions counselor often over the summer if you have questions. Also, get talking to future classmates on Facebook so you can make friends! The APU Class of 2015 page is where I made many friends before even getting to school, you can do the same! Have goals for the school year- not just long term goals, but lots of short term ones that you can achieve throughout the year. Have a mentor. Whether it is your alpha leader, RA, a professor you meet, ask an older person to be your mentor throughout college and guide you through life. Use ratemyprofessors.com to the fullest. You won't regret it. You will regret not using it! Compare book prices on amazon and the bookstore. Don't pay more than you need to., 7760=Honestly everyone could fit in at this school. We don't necessarily have a specific cookie cutter mold that you have to fit. There are many out of state students that attend here which adds to the diversity. The only requirement that I believe that would be necessary is that you have an open and receptive heart to the Christian lifestyle. There are many on-fire Christians at this school that might catch you off guard if you have never been exposed but they definitely should not intimidate you. You are not required to be a Christian but that doesn't mean that you can go about living any which way you please. The university wants to maintain its reputation of its motto to have God First. It goes all the way up to our president who constantly shows us a God driven heart to care for each and everyone person. If you can just buy into the mission you will enjoy your experience to the utmost. It says in the most cliche verse of the whole Bible, John 3:16, that ...God so loved the WORLD..., the entire world and that is what we are called to do as Christians as difficult and challenging as that may be but with the strength and love that God empowers us with each and every person will feel a sense of belonging. Some people who may not enjoy this experience are ones that dislike: Warm weather Suburban areas Required Chapel attendances (3 a week) Required Community service (120 credits by graduation) Required Bible Courses Having a good time! haha Like I said, this school only requires an open and willing heart ready to listen and act on the way God is pushing or pulling you. Sit back, relax and enjoy our Creators wild ride!!!, 745070=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 635243=Skip out on the caf (1899 dining hall) it ruins your stomach, but the west campus eating areas are way better. Their is two sandwich shops, a sushi place, pizza place, fast food type place, BBQ stand, Mexican restaurant, coffee shop, and west campus cafeteria on campus., 377852=Azusa Pacific University has a satellite school, which is conveniently located in my city of Victorville. The facility is beautiful and very functional. The instructors are all very knowledgeable. I am proud to become a graduate of APU in November of 2012!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Anyone who is interested in going to school in a warm, sunny place. Anyone who likes Southern California. Anyone who is a Christian. Anyone who dislikes legalistic schools. Tips for prospective students Amazing school, but very expensive. Worth the cost, but it definitely hurts my parent's bank account. Sorry Mom and Dad! Will enjoy being here A great campus with friendly students and professors. I loved every minute of my preview weekends! Everyone is so helpful and welcoming! I can't wait to be at APU in the Fall! Will learn a lot Very impressive academics!
