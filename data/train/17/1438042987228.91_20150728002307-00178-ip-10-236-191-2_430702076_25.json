            "NOVEL GENES INVOLVED IN BIOSYNTHESIS - The invention provides a novel MYB class transcription factor gene (nucleic acid sequences, protein sequences, and variants and fragments thereof) designated MYB14 by the applicants, that is useful for manipulating the production of flavonoids, specifically condensed tannins, in plants. The invention provides the isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding proteins with at least 70% identity to any one of MYB14 polypeptide sequences of SEQ ID NO: 14 and 46 to 54. The invention also provides, constructs, vectors, host cells, plant cells and plants genetically modified to contain the polynucleotide. The invention also provides methods for producing plants with altered flavonoid, specifically condensed tannin production, making use of the MYB14 nucleic acid molecules of the invention.",

The comestible may be a beverage, such as a carbonated soft drink, fruit juice, water or grain-based beverage. 03-04-2010 Margaret Hildick-Pytte, Mosman Park AU Patent application number Description Published 20140292509 EMERGENCY SERVICES SYSTEM AND METHOD - An emergency services system (\u201cESS\u201d) for a worksite is constituted by a number of tags, a mesh network, and a management system. Each person on the worksite is provided with a tag. Each tag when activated and logged onto the ESS uniquely identifies the person carrying that tag. The mesh network comprises a number of nodes and is arranged to provide communication over the entirety of the worksite. The nodes communicate with active tags. The management system receives and processes position data of active",
