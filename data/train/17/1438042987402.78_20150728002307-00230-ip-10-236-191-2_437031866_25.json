            "OPTICAL SIGNAL CONTROL DEVICE AND OPTICAL SIGNAL CONTROL METHOD - An optical signal control device includes an optical signal control unit and a drive circuit. The optical signal control unit includes m number of optical waveguides for propagating carrier light and (m\u00d7n) number of interaction regions, n number of interaction regions formed on each of the optical waveguides. The drive circuit includes (m\u00d7n) number of phase control units. The (m\u00d7n) number of phase control unit output a data signal for controlling the action of the (m\u00d7n) number of interaction regions to each of the (m\u00d7n) number of interaction regions. Each of the (m\u00d7n) number of phase control units outputs the data signal so that timing when the carrier light propagates to the interaction region to output the data signal and timing when the data signal arrives at the interaction region are synchronized. One of m and n is two or more.",
            "OPTICAL WAVEGUIDE DEVICE, OPTICAL INTERFEROMETER AND CONTROL METHOD FOR OPTICAL WAVEGUIDE DEVICE - In order to independently perform control of a phase difference and a loss of light transmitting through an optical waveguide in a simple and easy configuration, an optical waveguide device includes an optical waveguide provided with two electrodes each supplied with a corresponding one of two signals; and a control unit for controlling the two signals so as to cause a phase variation and a loss variation which are caused in light transmitting through the optical waveguide by the two signals to each have a predetermined value."

Therefore, in an unlinkable anonymizing method, a uni-directional function such as a hash value calculation is applied to a combination data of related information such as an individual identifiable ID number or data, ID information and a key symbol in case of the anonymization, or a relational data such as a specimen number from only which an individual cannot be identified. A correspondence table of the anonymization number and the individual information is deleted. An estimation of an original individual or a specimen number from the anonymization number is prevented by use of uni-directional function. The access to the data after the anonymization is limited only to the owner who knows anonymization key data or the mandatory of the information. 20100034376 Published Description Patent application number Masao Satoh, Tokyo JP 10-30-2014 IMAGE COMPOSITING DEVICE AND IMAGE COMPOSITING METHOD - It is an object to generate a desired composite image in which a motion area of a subject is correctly composited. 20140321703 Published Description Patent application number Masaki Satoh, Tokyo JP //]]> BarDraw('2597974',['Patent applications by Masahiko",
