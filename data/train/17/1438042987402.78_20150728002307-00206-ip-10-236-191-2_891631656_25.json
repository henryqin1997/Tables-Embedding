            "Looking to develop their independence, focused, not scared of a challenge, sociable, and responsible.",
            "My main tip for prospective students would be to not slack off in classes. Do your work first and then enjoy the fun opportunities that DePaul has to offer. Look for a school where you think you would enjoy yourself the most and can really help you with your career path and I think DePaul is that school.",
            "DePaul is expensive, but I lucked out with a good scholarship. However, DePaul provides students with financial aid, therefore the price of the school should not persuade you from not attending.",
            "I'm really glad that I chose DePaul. I have had such a great experience just within my first year. I have met a lot of great people, the campus is nice, and you can do a lot here since DePaul is located in Chicago. I like the size of the campus because I am able to run into people that have taken classes with and this can help with developing a friendship. The other thing I enjoy is that there is always some activity going on, therefore you can never get bored here.",
            "I would have to say that I am learning a lot from being here at DePaul, not just academically, but personally. The one thing I have learned while being here is not to slack off because it will make your studying harder and you will be lost in class when discussions occur. The school offers some interesting courses and they make sure you are taking the designated courses toward earning your degree. The advisers are also very helpful if you are confused about what courses to take for the quarter. I ran into that problem when I first started out at DePaul."

Furthermore, if you are an international student, have luck in trying to find some sort of scholarship because financial aid is not available to international students. If you are in the music school, however, you are almost guaranteed that you will have some sort of scholarship \u2013 I believe 100% of all the freshman of the class 2013 got scholarships ranging from $3,000 to $15,000. Financial aid is big for Americans, but international students is very very competitive and hard., 767101=While I do not live in a DePaul dorm, I do live in a DePaul-affiliated apartment building called 1237 West. The facilities are nice and residents receive a lot of discounts at local stores, but it is very antisocial. There is a lot of drinking and drugs on the freshman floor and the RA's and RD do not enforce their no-tolerance policy., 127175=Right now, I am a college sophomore - a double major in Biology (Pre-med concentration) and Political Science. I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field. They are very knowledgable, and for the most part, friendly., 766231=There is only one place on campus to eat, which is the Student Center. When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot. Most of the time I cook my own meals or visit local restaurants., 276481=the dorm life is okay, make sure you are comfortable with it before you committ to it because depaul will not let you switch dorms, roommates without paying a $1000 deposit. dorm life makes you feel like you are in high school again because of the mandatory meetings, rules and regulations. i would suggest living in the apartment style dorms to have more freedom., 811616=There is a great amount of options for on-campus and off-campus housing. At the Lincoln-Park campus you can choose from the traditional-style residence halls: Belden-Racine Hall(5-story), Clifton-Fullerton Hall (6-story), Corcoran Hall (4-story), Munroe Hall (6-story), Seton Hall (4-story), University Hall (4-story); or the apartment-style residence halls: Centennial Hall (4 story), McCabe Hall (7 story), Sanctuary Hall & Town homes, Sheffield Square Apartments, Vincent & Louise House, and 1237 West. The Loop Campus offers housing at the University Center (UC) which is shared by the DePaul students, Roosevelt University, Robert Morris University, and Columbia College. There are a ton of options for you to live comfortably for your college journey., 74891=Apply early! DePaul has an Early Action program with a deadline in mid-November and they will notify you by mid-December. This way you get top consideration for scholarships and financial aid. After the Early Action deadline, they look at applications as they come in (rolling) until February. The biggest mistake that I made when applying to DePaul was sending my application in the last day possible. It's more important that they get your application than all your transcripts and test scores., 860587=I cannot really judge here, as I don't attend the school, but I don't think it is very good. The 2014 Secondary Education grads upon their first year of teaching earned a median income of 29,500 a year. This is far lower than the median for the whole state of Illinois, which is 35,000 a year. It makes me wonder if DePaul does not adequately prepare students school districts know this so they offer a lower starting salary., 864665=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 844002=DePaul has many great opportunities compared to other colleges. Being in the city and having many of the alumni work in the city gives the school and its current students many connections. DePaul also has a great calendar system where the students get a full month's break from Thanksgiving until January, yet the courses still cover all the information needed., 6832=I have just recently transferred to DePaul University in June of this year. I have taken 3 summer classes and found I am able to graduate almost 6 months early due to the University's flexible and accomodating class requirements. In three months I have been able to get a jump start on my education. Despite the larger classes, the professors provide ample time to get in touch. I feel like they are just as dedicated to my success as I am., 785360=Know there are two campuses one downtown and the Lincoln Park area. For example business, majors typically have classes downtown so it's a lot of more commuting downtown and being in-between the big buildings. Science students typically have class in Lincoln park where the quad and the newly remodeled library is. The school is also on a quarter system so you do 30 weeks in a year taking typically 4 classes a quarter. The classes go fast so make sure to be on top of your game. We usually start around the second week in September have break from thanksgiving until the beginning of January, then a spring break at the end of march and start summer break in June.}",

In the center of Chicago, the opportunities are endless. It is exciting to be fully indulged in the business/professional life from the start of your higher education. So, if a student is pursuing business, arts, or technology, DePaul has the connections and city involvement to make your future flourish. Tips for prospective students DePaul University has such a high-quality alumni connection, and finding a job is almost inevitable. My current employer was a graduate of DePaul looking to help out a fellow student. I highly recommend jumping into the city life head first and embracing all the networking available. Bang for the buck Because it is a private university, I feel as though prices are escalated for the name. It is hard for me to get my head wrapped around the idea of",
