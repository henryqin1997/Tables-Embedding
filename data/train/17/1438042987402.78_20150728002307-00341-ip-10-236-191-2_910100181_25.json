There is a Late Night dining service every weeknight from 8:00PM to 1:00AM in case you get hungry at night, or in my case, have a late night study session at the library., 218785=I am currently going to be a transfer student to EIU in the fall of 2012 as a Sophomore/Junior student. The transfer to EIU has almost been a breeze, and I feel that I am really welcomed into the college. I am excited to see what a great year I can have when attending EIU!!!, 418776=Eastern provides a bus system to Chicago-area malls over breaks to provide relief for students like me who live very North of the school. It's a round trip ticket that can be purchased on campus and is a huge help for students who get a little home-sick from time-to-time or don't have another mode of transportation over breaks. Eastern is also all about their sports! Football and basketball games are a huge part of our lives! We enjoy being a pridefull school and Friday night games make for great memories. And did I mention, all games are completely free to students? Awesome! Eastern provides a great deal of scholarship and financial aid opportunities on top if it's already incredibly reasonable tuition prices. The board has decided that the 2014-15 school year will be the first year since 1994 that the school has not raised tuition at all., 184280=Although college may be tough at times, the student to faculty ratio at EIU is 16:1 meaning you have plenty of one to one help from the professors. At EIU, the professors want you to excel so they provide office hours for you to attend and majority of the time you can stop by whenever you would like. College is a different environment from high school so the work will not be easy but it is not hard either; as long as you put forth the effort and study time, an A can be easily attained., 445571=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 121960=as usual, most people think that colleges are expensive which they are but eiu has a fair price for what a college student has access to. a library that is open until 12:45 a.m. every week night. a recreational center with six basketball courts, a dodgeball court, two ping-pong tables, a inside track, a full work out center. there is a student service center that can help any student from a computer problem to finding a building when needed,, 369159=Try to register for classes early so you won't get stuck with 8:00 a.m classes. Remain focused but have fun, its college. Get your work done before you go out to party., 43438=i was accepted to eastern and i visited the school in 2010 i really fell in love with the music section even though my major will be psychology. i just love the atmosphere and everyone there was welcoming and very nice. i want to visit once more before i make my final decision on if i really want to go or not.}",

Eastern is a great campus, there are cool parties to go to and many formal events to attend. There are plenty of things to do. EIU is great for students that like to party, but it's also great for students that are more laid back and reserved. Tips for prospective students Be friendly! The people here are, it will be a lot easier to make friends and enjoy your time here. Join clubs and intramural sports too. It helps because after classes you have a lot of down time. DON'T PROCRASTINATE ON HOMEWORK...get it done when it is assigned. Trust me, getting your homework done early will be the greatest habit you could have. Bang for the buck",
