    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{219650=UCLA is known for having one of the best dining halls among the UC's. Here, at our diverse collection of dining halls, the UCLA cooks make food that will satisfy the mouths of every student. Whether you love comfort food, are a junk food addict, or love healthy salads, we have that all here for you at UCLA. Knowing that we have a unique array of students here at UCLA from all around the world, we have special on campus dining locations to cater to specific tastes. For example, we have Feast which offers only Asian food and features food from two cultures each day. Thursday is usually Korean food and Thai food, my favorite. For those who love quick Chinese take-out or Mexican food, Rendezvous would be perfect for you. For panini, pizza, and hearty salad lovers, Cafe 1919 is your ideal selection. Finally, for the late night food munchies, Bruin Cafe is the most popular spot to get something to eat, especially at night. It stays open to about 1 or 2 in the morning so students can always get something warm to eat when they are hungry at night. We also have our main dining halls which serve food buffet style. You can pick whatever you want to eat with no restrictions on how many times you want to eat. These dining halls always have a great sense of community, so combined with great food, the dining halls will be your third home (behind the dorms). I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed by all of the delicious food options we have for you at UCLA and that you will probably gain more than the infamous Freshman 15., 763147=There were several dining halls around the campus residence. There was Covell Commons (my favorite), Hedrick, Rieber, Bruin Cafe, Cafe 1919, De Neve, and Rendevous. All of the dining halls were right next to the dorms. Before students arrive on campus, they would have to select a meal plan. I recall that there were various options (I had the smaller plan because I never ate that much). Once this was done, students were able to enter the dining halls with a swipe of their bruincards. The dining halls functioned like a buffet. Students were able to select the foods they wanted, and then go have seconds. Next, for those who preferred healthier food choices, the dining halls had several dishes for students to choose from. This included vegetarian options. Several people, including myself, sighed with relief when we could have spaghetti without the meatballs (yuck). If students did not have time to hang out at the dining halls with their friends because they have to study, or they could go in and have breakfast, there was Bruin Cafe, Cafe 1919, and Rendevous. With just a swipe of the bruincard, students could take their meals to go. For some students, this was a relief because many of them had tough schedules. Going to class was highly imperative., 512418=UCLA is where my deceased father went to graduate school for his master's in Engineer. I have been accepted into UCLA for this upcoming fall of 2012. I am so proud to go to my dream school and to follow in the footsteps of my father., 823633=While the campus is mostly safe, there have been a few robberies near the apartments that many students live in. Everything seems okay during the daytime, but make sure you have a buddy to walk with after the sun sets. Luckily for Bruins, there are evening van escorts and walking escorts if you want to get to your apartment safely. Once, after a mock trial practice (which ended at 11:30 PM), I felt unsafe walking to my car. So I called the walking escort service, and a police officer walked me to my car., 764693=Dorm life was fun. I was residing at Rieber Terrace that neighbored Hedrick, Rieber Vista, and Rieber. There was also De Neve, Sproul, Sunset Vista, and more. As of Fall 2012, additional halls will be opened. I recall that the new building stood between De Neve and Sproul Hall. When applying for housing, students answer a series of personality questions. This was necessary, so the computer system could narrow down which students were compatible with other students. Luckily, I had very cool room mates. On each floor of the dorms, there were Residential Assistants who helped or answered questions for students, regarding campus life and more. The RA's that lived on my floor at the time were very outgoing and made dorm life extra fun with movies, games, and pizza. Every now and then, I thought that there was a party outside while finishing my homework. The dorm rooms were relatively small, which was expected. I lived in a Triple, so the room looked much smaller. However, my room mates and I decorated the entire place, so it felt more like home, rather than a small-cramped-up-room. If students did not like their housing choice, the Housing Services located at Sproul Hall, would help students seek out other housing options, such as off-campus housing. There are many apartments next to the campus. The cost for the apartments, last I checked, vary., 490126=Don't step on the 6th step of the Jan Steps, 670537=The food on campus is AMAZING! From Bruin Cafe you can get soups and wraps and salads, to Cafe 1919 you can get paninis and gelatto, to 3 dining halls that have such a vast selection of food, to Rendez-vous with a selection of chinese or mexican food, and to Feast which varies from asain to hawiian gormet food- you cannot beat the food on campus at UCLA., 452537=Affordable for CA residents. But after 2012 tuition and housing will raise. Budgeting cuts ruined most of the fun. Don't know what they are spending all our money on....but we get new dorm buildings? Yay?, 20797=I'm not exactly sure what Bang for the buck means but I read another person's review and they were talking about the costs. Cost of Attendance. Yikes. Not a great number. I am a college freshman and my tuition for the Fall started around 26,000 and in just one quarter, it went up to 27,000. This school year, 2009-2010, the UC Regents decided to raise our tuition by around 30%. Unbelievable. There were student-protests and everything but the Regents still went on with the increase in tuition. If you are a high school student, or any student, apply for scholarships NOW. If you want to go to UCLA or any UC or private school, start applying for scholarships!!!! Tuition is ridiculously expensive. I come from a single-oarent household and I had no money for college (ie. no college fund) and fortunately won some scholarships, which helped me A LOT. Also, there are more expenses you must make other than tuition. There are housing applications and deposits. Doctor visits if you waive UCLA's insurance offer. The case that UCLA over awarded you and you must return the money. For most clubs you have to pay to be members. Money to buy lunch down at Ackerman or Luvalle Commons because you're down there waiting for your next class and do not have time to go back to the dining halls. Textbooks are also very expensive. There are more things I paid for but can't remember everything at the moment. I'm not trying to scare you off from applying/attending to UCLA. I just want you to be aware of where your money will be going. So start saving or spend your money on things you NEED rather than WANT, etc., 1133542=To prospective students... SIR!!! Can't wait to see you guys in fall of 2013, 445218=UCLA is great for students who are really diverse in their interest just because the school has all these different classes to offer. There is also a very large selection of clubs that consists of over 1000. The campus does have a lot of hills, so it is great to help squeezing in the little exercises every day., 444677=There are clubs for almost anything here. There are cultural clubs and religious clubs. There are clubs geared towards a specific occupation where they usually help you in informing how to reach that dream job. There are over 1000 clubs that you can learn about at the Enormous Activities Fair that will occur in the beginning of Fall quarter., 238127=I mentioned this already under dorm life, but again, I will say it is amazing. The great thing about our school is there are places on campus that you can get take-out. Most colleges only offer dining hall options, but our school has great dining halls AND great take-out places. It's really good. My favorite is Cafe 1919, they serve Italian food, but I just love the Florentine and the Bolognese! Yuuuummmy!, 904766=If there is one area that UCLA succeeds at, it's food. Ranked number two in the nation, people actually come visit UCLA to eat at a dining hall. Where else would this happen? UCLA has four dining halls that are buffet style. De Neve is the most popular, with everything from American favorites such as burgers, pizza and a salad bar, to daily specials that can feature different ethnic dishes, to the glorious section dedicated to dessert. Covel is it's smaller counterpart, famous for it's wood-fired pizza. Feast at Reiber opened last year and features rotating Pan-Asian cuisines, with two features per meal (like Japanese and Chinese, or Indian and Thai, etc). Hedrick is currently under renovation, and rumor are flying as to what it may feature. All dining halls have options for vegetarians and vegans as well. There are also four quick serve restaurants. Bruin Cafe, or b-caf, features deli sandwiches, soups, salads and wraps, with combos that you can get for a swipe, as well as a selection of Coffee Bean coffee and smoothies as well as a range of baked goods (the famous vegan chocolate chip cookies!). What is even better is that b-caf is open until 2 am for late night coffee runs during finals! Cafe 1919 is an Italian restaurant that has personal pizzas, paninis, salads, and desserts including, yes, gelato and tiramisu. This place is dangerously good and you get a very full meal with a swipe. Rendezvous has two sides, the Mexican side and the Asian side. Mexican has burritos, quesadillas, nachos, etc, and the Asian side serves up Panda Express-like combos. Both sides have daily specials as well to spice things up. Rende is open until midnight so you won't get hungry at night! Finally, De Neve dining hall is transformed into Late Night at 9 pm, where you can get all the comfort food you want, from burgers, to chicken tenders, curly fries, onion rings, mozzarella sticks, and milkshakes for all your late night cravings. Basically, I regularly bribe people to visit me by offering to swipe them in. So UCLA has great food all over the hill. On campus, we have everything from subway to yoshinoya. And Westwood has the famous Diddy Riese, Fat Sals, 800 Degrees...and more common ones that meet every craving from Corner Bakery, BJs, Yogurtland, Chipotle and In n Out, to Japanese food, Korean BBQ, boba, shawarma, and much more. One thing for sure is that you will never go hungry. As for the freshman fifteen...well the unavoidable abundance of stairs throughout campus will help you with that!, 161732=I love UCLA, and I don\u2019t know anybody who is not enjoying their time here. Compared to other colleges, it has a relatively active campus and it\u2019s set in Los Angeles. There\u2019s always something to do if you get out of your room. If you dorm, there are floor activities the halls set up. Free food is involved in many. Speaking of food, UCLA has several food places open late for those nights you\u2019re cramming for finals. Caf\u00e9 1919 opens until midnight and has paninis, pizzas, and gelato. Bruin Caf\u00e9 has sandwiches, smootihes, and most importantly, coffee until 2am. Friends who visit from other campuses have expressed jealousy at how spoiled us Bruins are, for having so many things available when we want it, and sustenance offered at such late hours. Within the school, you can join a frat or sorority, or just go to the parties for the experience. I emphasize extracurricular activities because there are so many and they are such a great experience. There\u2019s a niche for everybody, and most people get really involved in at least one org. You can perform onstage in culture nights, play club soccer, sing in a choir group, build houses in Nicaragua, etc. The possibilities are endless. There\u2019s Westwood within walking distance. It has many food places as well, and some people make it a point to try everything at least once. Diddy Riese, the ice cream & cookie sandwich dessert store, is pretty popular. There are also cheap shoe stores, book stores, and movie theaters. The LACMA and Getty Museums are close by, as well as the David Geffen Theater, and even on campus, there are always performances in Royce Hall. Hollywood is a short ride away, and of course, this means a lot of celebrity run-ins, and clubbing events., 911134=Come visit! Immerse yourself in the campus where there is always something exciting going on, whether it be a concert, a movie filming, a basketball game or an activist protest. When I first stepped foot on campus, I could feel the energy. It seemed like everyone was involved in something, and working on an agenda. Coming here, I realized it was true. There are endless activities to get involved in. There are so many events just for students. The beautiful buildings are what you walk by every day, and all of Westwood is at your disposal whether you need groceries from Ralphs and Target or if you are standing in line for the famous Diddy Riese ice cream sandwiches. The Christmas lights that decorate the streets of Westwood yearlong add to the welcoming atmosphere of the neighborhood, something impressive for such a large school in such a large city to say. While the academic prowess can speak for itself, campus life is so much more. UCLA has won more NCAAs than any other university. Unlike many highly academic schools, UCLA is anything but lacking in the school spirit department. From the random 8-claps heard around campus on a daily basis to the thousands of people strong cheers at the Rose Bowl or Pauley Pavilion, UCLA athletes make sure that there is always a reason to proudly bleed blue. Rich in tradition, UCLA engraves itself in your life from the beginning--being bruintized at orientation, learning the 8-clap, and having a week of welcome events to kick off fall quarter. UCLA brings together the best of all worlds: the rich tradition and athletic history of a state school, the quality research and academics of a world wide top ranked school, and the facilities, affluence and alumni network that parallel that of a privately funded school. All that is necessary to sell the school is one visit! How to get here? Well, UCLA has an amazingly diverse population. Many students were top of their classes in high school, with perfect GPAs and an impressive list of awards and extra-curriculars to follow. However, there are many more here for their athletic talent, artistic genius, or perhaps entrepreneurial gift. While we all have strengths in different areas, one thing is for sure: every student at UCLA is admitted for a reason. So use the essays as a chance to tell YOUR story, get involved in things that you are passionate about, and maintain a high standard for academics. While there is no sure formulaic way that can guarantee admission when just under 16000 students were admitted from an application pool of over 72000 for incoming freshmen in Fall 2012, an acceptance rate of about 21%, significantly lower than past years and expected to continue. That said, genuine passion comes through in applications. Look not to inflate your grades through dishonest means, or to fill up your resume with a list of clubs you are supposedly involved in, do things you would want to do even if colleges didn't look at it. That way when you write about it, the admissions committee will see a potential student that will contribute to the community at UCLA. Don't let low test scores or something deter you from applying, give yourself a chance, and know that no matter what happens, not all qualified applicants are admitted, and if you are truly all that you believe yourself to be, you will succeed wherever you end up, and you WILL love it., 259059=Cafe 1919 Cookie Sensation Gelato. That is all. Kidding, there's 4 dining halls/restaurants and 3 caf\u00c3\u00a9s on campus, within a very close range of the res halls - just a 2 minute walk away at best. De Neve and Covel are two very satisfying options, though De Neve is the more vegetarian-friendly option (I'm vegetarian). They serve hearty and delicious breakfasts as well. Covel leans towards Italian cuisine while De Neve serves more on the Mexican side. Feast is the pan-Asian restaurant, which focuses more on flavor than quantity. There's a wide range of cuisines - Indian, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Thai and even Vietnamese and Hawaiian! They're the ones I go to the most often because of the variety available for vegetarians. Bruin Plate is the other restaurant, a favorite among a lot of people on the Hill. Healthy and yet lip-smacking, the food there is very good, though if you're hungry, the small servings would eventually translate to stacks and stacks of plates on your table., 732456=UCLA is known for some of the best dining halls in the country. Not to mention there are 4 main dining halls that each house a different style of food from around the world and also quick eateries in case you're in a hurry or want something a little sweet like gelato or tiramisu from cafe 1919, 364399=the dining commons are okay. de neve is definitely the best. rendezvous, cafe 1911, and bruin cafe are all great choices for take out!, 768722=If one is academically driven and hell-bent on pursuing their future career goals, then UCLA is the best university to go. It is highly competitive as many prospective students apply for admissions; over 95,000 applicants applied for Fall 2012. Additionally, it is a safe environment., 583220=It's paradise in a subtle way that makes me feel in a bubble of perfect. And at the same, I know UCLA is a world-class university that has potential for discoveries--such as 1969 with Prof. Leonard Kleimrock and the internet. And at the end, it has a vibrant student body that makes it all perfect., 572557=If you're a bruin, then you hate the Trojans. You may think you won't get consumed in all this silly rivalry but trust me you will. For example, at the moment you may think you will never say something as ridiculous as You can only use a Trojan once, but a Bruin lasts forever! but you will!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Students who want to learn more about other cultures; students who have a work hard, play hard philosophy; students who are school-spirited; students with a positive outlook on life; ambitious students ready to learn about anything and everything. Tips for prospective students - Apply for every type of financial aid, especially if you feel that you won't get any. You never know how many other students feel the same way, and your persistence will show. - Take advantage of your professors' wisdom. Ask them questions and visit them during their office hours whenever you can. - Meet a lot of people. Just talk to everyone you meet. Meet their friends. Networking is SOOO important, and you never know who could help you out in the future. - Get involved with some type of community service. Not only does this look great on a resume, but you also learn a lot about human nature and about yourself through it. - Make a schedule and stick to it. This will really prove your discipline. - Form good habits. It takes 21 days to form a habit, and it's always hardest at the beginning, but if you can stick it out, the rewards will definitely outweigh the hardships you went through. - Study every night.
