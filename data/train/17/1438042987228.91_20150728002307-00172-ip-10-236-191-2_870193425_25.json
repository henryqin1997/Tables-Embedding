    "textBeforeTable": "First of all, I need to give you the raw numbers. Check out the table below to see the breakdown for Big 12 teams. I have used data for the top seven teams in the Big 12, all seven of which should be headed for the NCAA Tournament. The numbers listed are free throws attempted for each team and that team's opponents in both home and road games. Texas has played eight home games and Missouri and Baylor eight on the road. Every other team has one home game and one road game remaining. Are those statements true? I crunched the numbers. And they sure don't look true. Officiating may be the most common complaint among Big 12 basketball fans. After nearly every game, fans are ripping the stripes up and down on message boards. Most fans will preface it with, \"I'm not saying they were biased, I'm just saying they were bad,\" or with \"I know that officials don't decide games.\" The timing of this article is going to make it seem like sour grapes. I know this. The Missouri Tigers lost 63-53 at Kansas State on Saturday. The Tigers shot 13 free throws. The Wildcats shot 34. But save the emails from Manhattan that tell me I'm whining. I'm not. I think the next few paragraphs will prove it.",
    "textAfterTable": "In other words, of the top seven teams in the Big 12, all seven of them have shot more free throws than their opponents at home. Baylor has attempted just eight more than its opponents in seven games. Missouri has taken 16 more. Every other team has taken at least 32 more free throws than visiting teams in seven games. That averages out to nearly five attempts per game. The group is led by Texas, which has taken an average of eight more free throws than its opponent in every single Big 12 home game. The flip side is what happens to these teams on the road. The seven teams have taken a combined 117 fewer free throws on the road than their opponents. And that included Kansas-the only team with a road advantage-taking 48 more than its opponents. Take the Jayhawks out of the picture and the remaining six teams have taken 165 fewer free throws on the road than their home opponents. So, what we are supposed to believe, is that the same teams that get to the line an average of 4.96 times more than their opponents somehow forget how to attack or defend on the road. Those teams that average five more attempts in each home game take an average nearly four fewer free throws than the opponent when they're playing in someone else's building (that figure doesn't include Kansas",
