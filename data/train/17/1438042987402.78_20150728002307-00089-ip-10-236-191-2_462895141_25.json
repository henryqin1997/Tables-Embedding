The next day, a compound of interest at a certain concentration is added to each well. After 24 and 48 hours of incubation, the cells are harvested, washed and counted. The following steps are performed using the Multimek 96 robot. Then, 500 viable cells per well are plated in a 96-well plate that is coated with PolyHema to prevent attachment of the cells to the bottom of the well. Agarose (3% stock) is melted, diluted in warmed media and added to the cells to a final concentration of 0.5%. After the soft agar solidified, the plates are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 6 days. Alamar blue dye is added to cells and plates are incubated for an additional 6 hours. The optical density change is measured on a Tecan plate reader and is considered to correlate with the number of colonies formed in soft agar. A cancerous cell is able to grow on the agar and thus will show an increase in optical density. A reading of decreased optical density means that the cancer cells are being inhibited. It is contemplated that compounds of this invention will exhibit a decrease in optical density., 224542=N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (215 mL; 1240 mmol), triethylamine trihydrofluoride (81 mL; 496 mmol) and perfluoro-1-butanesulfonyl fluoride (15.0 mL; 83.5 mmol) were added to a solution of 7-12 (19.1 g; 82.7 mmol) in PhCF3 (310 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred at ambient temperature. Additional perfluoro-1-butanesulfonyl fluoride (7.5 mL; 41.8 mmol) was added after each of 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes. After a total of 18 hours, the reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel and was washed twice with 1.0 N HCl, twice with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and once with H2O. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to provide an orange oil. The crude material was loaded onto a pad of silica and eluted with 4:1 hexane:EtOAc to provide the product (7-13) as a yellow oil (15.4 g; 80%)., 14657=This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. provisional application Ser.

Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by reference., 58606=In 1995, the depletion of KSP using an antibody directed against the C-terminus of KSP was shown to arrest HeLa cells in mitosis with monoastral microtubule arrays (Blangy et al., Cell 83:1159-1169, 1995). Mutations in bimC and cut7 genes, which are considered to be homologues of KSP, cause failure in centrosome separation in Aspergillus nidulans (Enos, A. P., and N. R. Morris, Cell 60:1019-1027, 1990) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Hagan, I., and M. Yanagida, Nature 347:563-566, 1990). Treatment of cells with either ATRA (all trans-retinoic acid), which reduces KSP expression on the protein level, or depletion of KSP using antisense oligonucleotides revealed a significant growth inhibition in DAN-G pancreatic carcinoma cells indicating that KSP might be involved in the antiproliferative action of all trans-retinoic acid (Kaiser, A., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274, 18925-18931, 1999). Interestingly, the Xenopus laevis Aurora-related protein kinase pEg2 was shown to associate and phosphorylate X1Eg5 (Giet, R., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:15005-15013, 1999). Potential substrates of Aurora-related kinases are of particular interest for cancer drug development. For example, Aurora 1 and 2 kinases are overexpressed on the protein and RNA level and the genes are amplified in colon cancer patients., 241109=Compounds 1-15, and 18-86 in the table below were prepared using the methodology described in the previous Examples and Methods. Compounds 16 and 17 are prophetic compounds and can also be prepared in a similar manner. The starting materials used in the synthesis are recognizable to one of skill in the art and are commercially available or may be prepared using known methods. The compounds in Table 1 were named using AutoNom 2000 (Automatic Nomenclature) for ISIS/Base, implementing IUPAC standardized nomenclature. In one embodiment, provided is a stereoisomer of any one of the compounds in Table 1. In one aspect, the stereoisomer is an enantiomer. In another aspect, the stereoisomer is a diastereomer., 220050=Methanol (300 mL) was charged to a 1000 mL round bottom flask and the system was cooled with an ice bath. Acetyl chloride (89.3 mL; 1251 mmol) was added dropwise over a period of 15 minutes. The resulting solution was warmed to ambient temperature and the (S)-2-amino-4-pentenoic acid (7-9) (6.0 g; 139 mmol) was added in a single portion. The reaction mixture was heated at reflux for two hours and was then cooled to ambient temperature. The mixture was then concentrated in vacuo to provide a pale yellow oil. The product was dispersed in ethyl acetate (150 mL) and was again concentrated in vacuo; This sequence was repeated four times. The product 7-10 was an oil that solidified upon standing under vacuum overnight. 1H NMR analysis showed the product to be of sufficient purity for use without further purification., 302535=\u00a9 2004-2015 FreePatentsOnline.com.

The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 5 h at RT. After completion of the reaction, the contents were poured into ice water and extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layer was washed with water, brine, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to give a crude product 6-2. Purification was carried out by column chromatography to yield pure (61.7 g, 91.7%) as pale yellow oil., 199286=Amine 5-1 (1 eq.) dissolved in DCM is added to aldehyde 4-2 for a total concentration between 0.1-0.15 M.
