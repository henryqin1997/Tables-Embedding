Maynard, who played a major role in the achievement of the first manned landing on the moon. An engineer in the Apollo program from the beginning, he helped design the Apollo spacecraft and oversaw the design of the command-service and lunar modules. He led the team that developed the complex lunar mission flight plans. As chief of the Systems Engineering Division, he was responsible for all aspects of the construction and testing of the Apollo hardware. He planned the early Apollo test flights, including that of the first lunar landing, Apollo 11. Name suggested and citation prepared by R. Attwood.
