            "There are always campus police around. Also, when you are on campus you can always see a blue light. These lights have phones underneath that connect directly to campus police 24/7. Also, they have optional escorting service if you need to somewhere late at night.",
            "Greek life makes up approximately 15% of campus. That way one can be associated with Greek life but if one does not want to be they d not feel the pressure to try to be.",
            "There is a huge variety of clubs on campus that are completely student run. Also, if you do not like a club you can always make your own!",
            "Students who like to be dedicated to their studies but also want to have fun.",
            "There are a lot of traditions on campus. To learn more go to reslife.binghamton.edu and look at each resident area's events and traditions, they are a lot of fun!",
            "The value is exceptional for the price tag. Binghamton students are very successful at finding jobs comparable to much more expensive schools.",
            "Late night Binghamton, Hang out with friends, Go to a Baseball game",
            "Good but does not change very often.",
            "The dorms are pretty good. They are held up good and a lot of them are actually new.",
            "Academics are not too bad here, especially near the beginning.",
            "-Get GenEds out of the way early! -If you're interested in Business apply to SOM! -Make sure you show admission that you want to be here during the application process.",
            "The professors for upper level classes are very knowledgeable and caring. The food is pretty darn good but the only problem is that it does not change. One bad thing though is that a lot of freshman course are taught by graduate students... they aren't the best."

However, do NOT pack too much clothes! You simply do not need too many outfits. Also, do go overboard buying any school supplies before you get to the school, depending on your classes, all you might need is a pen, a pencil, a folder, and loose-leaf paper. Additionally, be wary of your meal plan allowance, because even though you are billed around $2000 for the year, you are only allotted $800 in the Fall and then the other $800 in the Spring. Don't go spending too much money on groceries available in the school with your meal plan, instead go to Walmart or Target! Finally, always go to class of course! The amount of freedom you have distorts your perception of reality, and soon enough, your coursework will catch up with you and you will have many sleepless nights catching up! Most importantly of all, make friends of course, and enjoy your stay at Binghamton!, 210965=The best place to live on campus now is in the Newing Community. It just opened in 2011 and it's definitely the most comfortable place to live on campus in terms of the buildings and rooms and the dining hall. Its also pretty close to the Union. The school is still adding new buildings to Newing. Mountainview is the next nicest place to live on campus, its fairly new but not the best in terms of location. Hinman is great for the super studious because it's close to the lecture hall and library. Dickingson and College-In-The-Woods are alright., 458343=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 451287=If you don't like winter or cloudy days, I suggest you go to another school. I love summer a lot and enjoy sunny warm days, and Binghamton weather is definitely the opposite of my preference. There is usually sun and shine the first month and half of school (end of August to mid October) and last months of school (end of April to mid May). Every other month is full of rain, cloud days, and snow. Definitely bring boots and a super warm jacket. It's always brick cold weather here after October., 430692=Disclosure: This reviewer is an adjunct faculty member (since 1997) as well as a student in one of the PhD programs. However, this reviewer attended BU in 1976 as a transfer student (dropped out in senior year) and again in 1984 completing both UG and MS by 1989. This is one of the top 100 schools in the country. It promotes research at the UG stage which provides practical experience desired by employers. Students can earn post-graduate degrees; some programs combine UG and Grad degrees reducing the time to earn both degrees., 58549=Prepare to study! I maintained a good average and got a 2280 on my SAT--never studied, never had a tutor all through highschool. Now, I study all the time! The professors expect you to keep up your end of the deal., 193901=I know a number of students who attend Binghamton, and I know that this school has a ton to offer a student in terms of academic, extracurricular, and career opportunities. The campus is well-kept and the student population is diverse. These are only a few of the reasons I chose to transfer to Binghamton for the Fall 2013 semester., 253667=Visited SUNY Binghamton in November and LOVED the campus. Also, the town of Binghamton itself seems very friendly and inviting. Definitely my first choice school., 156773=Here in Binghamton they're residential communities. Communities are Hinman, Dickinson, Newing, Mountain View, Susquehanna, and Hillside. The last two mentioned are apartment style residence, which is only available to upperclassman. Hinman, and Mountain View are suite style. Dickinson, and Newing are corridor style. Mind you, they are constructing a new Dickinson, so it will be brand new for incoming students during the 2013 year. Newing and Mountain View are new as well, and Hinman will be the oldest yet most social of the communities here in binghamton,.}",
