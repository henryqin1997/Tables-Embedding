But what a month it's been for the Dodgers and their incredible left-hander., 14553=The Dodgers have had nothing but high points lately: With 12 wins in 16 games, Los Angeles (47-37) has pulled virtually even with the slumping Giants (46-36) atop the NL West. The Dodgers were 9 1/2 games behind San Francisco on June 8, but erased the entire deficit in three weeks., 15908=The Dodgers took three of four from St. Louis in a rematch of last season's NL championship series. Ethier capped Los Angeles' four-run fifth inning with a shot to right off Shelby Miller (7-7) for his first homer since May 27., 16576=Indeed, St. Louis had little chance on another vintage day for Kershaw, who hasn't allowed a run since June 13. His 28-inning scoreless streak is the fifth-longest in franchise history, trailing only a who's-who of Dodgers luminaries: Orel Hershiser, Don Drysdale, Don Sutton and Sandy Koufax. Kershaw has the longest streak since Hershiser's record 59-inning run in 1988., 43828=\u00a9 2000-2014 Rogers Media. All rights reserved. Privacy Policy Ad Choices Terms of Service, 14060=Kershaw (9-2) extended his career-best scoreless streak to 28 innings in his first home start since throwing his first no-hitter June 18 against Colorado. He went 6-0 with an 0.82 ERA in June, yielding four runs in 44 innings and striking out 61.}",
