Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently, if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable, or at least annually at December 31 of each year. These tests are performed at the reporting unit level using a two-step, fair-value based approach. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. \u00a0The second step allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to the Company's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. \u00a0This derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit's goodwill.
