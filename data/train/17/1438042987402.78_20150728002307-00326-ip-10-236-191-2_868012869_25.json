The team with the most points at the end of the game is the winner. If teams are tied, then a single sudden-death puzzle is given to the captains of each team. If a captain buzzes in first and gives the correct answer then their team wins, but an incorrect answer automatically forfeits the game. Although no category is officially given they make reference to their own role as sudden-death questions. Examples are \"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish\", \"To the Victor, the Spoils\" and \"Winner Stays On\". Teams answer simultaneously using buzzers, and score 1 point for each puzzle they solve.
