As a student-athlete, I always looked to you as a role model and someone I could look up to and emulate. You taught me many things about the game of baseball. The most important of all was how to play the game with passion and intensity. It helped me in my career at LSU and on into a 10-year major league career. I have always reflected on your fire and motivational tactics and when I became the head coach at Farmingdale State College\u00a0and wanted to run my program in a similar manner. You were about playing the game as hard as you possibly can. I will never forget winning the state championship in 1987 and the look on your face -- just priceless. You started the baseball program at Shoreham-Wading River, the first-ever varsity coach, and spent countless hours sacrificed away from your wife and children to mold the program. Your championship wins and accolades are far too many to list, but it is impossible to measure the impact you had on thousands of ballplayers who came through your program. Those former players are seen everywhere in our community as leaders, business owners and positive influences on younger people. You have played a significant role as an educator of young people in our town and my respect for you goes beyond the ballfield. It was a gift for you to stay in the game long enough to coach my son Tyler. I consider you a close\u00a0friend, mentor and key influence in my life. Yours in baseball and thank you.

You might be wondering for what? Well, you have been a great mentor and role model throughout my life. You have impacted my life in so many ways and you continue\u00a0to do so each and every day. Our relationship goes back to when I was a young 13-year-old on your freshman football team. That is where you taught me to be a fierce competitor and a winner. Two years straight and no losses; wow, what a great memory I hold on to fondly. Then there was my dream senior year. There was so much I accomplished, but winning the Yaz Award was the icing on the cake. I still remember receiving the award and looking over at you and seeing the look on your face. You were truly proud of me. Well, I want you to know that award wasn't just for me but it was for the both of us. You were just as deserving because I couldn't have done it without you. The one thing that still haunts me today is not winning that Suffolk County Championship vs. Brentwood back in 1996. We were so close, I hope you know that winning a team title was always my main goal. You always taught me team accomplishments were always greater then individual accolades. You are still Coach to me but also my friend. I'm now learning how to be a great coach, and that is because of you. As I sit back and collect my thoughts, I find myself instilling the same morals and importance of team and how a team is a family into my players as you did. So Coach, thank you, thank you for always being there for me and being such an important figure in my life.\u00a0 Love always, your friend, Mark Frole Lindenhurst Physical Education teacher, Lindenhurst Class of 1996 ***********************************************************************************************************************************************, 6728=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suffolk County Baseball Coaches Association \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02015\u00a0 ALL-COUNTY AWARDS BANQUET \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 which will be held on ...\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0June 10th\u00a0* 6pm \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0@\u00a0Villa Lombardi\u00a0of Holbrook, New York \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Direction to Villa Lombardi ... http://long-island.newsday.com/cmlink/1.1283948?view=directions&site=xli&daddr=877%20Main%20St., Holbrook,%20NY%2011741 **********************************************************************************************}",
