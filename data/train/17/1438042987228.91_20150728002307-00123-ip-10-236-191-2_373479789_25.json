There were no standard or recommended names for countries. The situation has improved since then with the appearance of the USPS International Mail Manual (IMM), including an index of countries and localities, first discovered (by me) in 2000, newly available in HTML so we can link directly to it and to sections of it. The new HTML version also seems to be greatly expanded over the earlier versions, for example containing long lists of cities with postcodes for each country (e.g. Russia)., 5035=Links (verified October 2013):, 11094=The USPS lists the following general addressing guidelines (October 2013); most (but not all) of these points apply also to international mail. Actually the guidelines given here are from the 2003-2007 page, which has disappeared; the 2010 page is pretty sparse, and now there's a 2013 page. It seems that USPS now focuses on marketing its own \"address management\" software to put addresses into proper format, rather than explaining what that format is. Anyway, here are the former guidelines:, 48175=From September 2006, the country code for Serbia, including the autonomous regions, is RS:, 40950=The UTF-8 conversion was done on 20 January 2003; the previous ISO-8859-1 Latin Alphabet\u00a01 version, current as of that date, remains available HERE (but won't be updated). The UTF-8 version includes text in Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tibetan, Thai, Khmer, and other scripts that can't be represented in Latin-1 but are easily accommodated by UTF-8. Most of this text is in the COUNTRY INDEX. Anybody who can supply missing country names or other relevant items in native language and script is welcome to send them in; I'll be glad to add them (with credit, of course).}",

Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, these countries have also been known \u2013 with decreasing frequency \u2013 as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The country names shown are the ones recognized by the USPS (highlighted names link to postal authorities, or at least they did at the time this section was last updated but web addresses tend to change out from under us). See INDEX for long, local, and other forms of each country name. The ISO and Car codes are explained in the Europe section. The postcode formats and city line examples come from the Universal Postal Union except where noted., 135991=Not only are countries to be found inside Italy, but a piece of Italy can be found inside another country: Campione d'Italia in Switzerland on Lake Lugano. It chose to stay part of Lombardy, and hence Italy, when Ticino became a Swiss Canton in 1798. It uses the Swiss postcode CH-6911 (as well as Italian CAP 22060), the Swiss telephone code +41\u00a091, and has Italian police driving in Swiss-registered automobiles. But it's Italy. (Also see the section on Germany, another country with a piece inside Switzerland.), 190826=As you can see, the UPU says that Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Russia put the postal code on a line by itself under the city name. This is a rather new phenomenon, and it might be confusing for USPS postal sorters, which until about 2000 could always expect the name of the city to appear on the line just above the name of the country (the United Kingdom has adopted the same practice), and in any case does not seem to be the form used on most mail pieces., 66892=Monday, September 16, 2013, Reuters: The United States and Cuba sit down on Monday in Havana for a second round of talks on re-establishing direct mail services between the two countries after a 50-year ban., 289465=This can be seen in Issue 37, June 2010 (the current issue when this sentence was last edited) of the International Mail Manaual, Section 122, which shows this example:, 81417=The change took effect in June 2006. The old postcodes are invalid. The hard cutover took place in June 2008. must be used on bulk mail and the postcode can be omitted from regular mail. The new postcodes are now required on all mail.

As always, postcodes are in flux. The examples above (current as of January 2003) are contrasted with examples from our own database from just a few years prior:, 167032=France still owns a tiny piece of North America, the islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon (Michelon), just south of Newfoundland, the last remaining bit of New France. Mark Brader points out: \"It's the only place I know of in North America where, if you go east from any part of it until you enter a different time zone, you put your watch back; certainly the only one where you put it back half an hour. SP&M uses zone -3; the island of Newfoundland, which has a southward peninsula east of SP&M, uses -3:30.\" Saint-Pierre and Miquelon was also one of the few parts of North America controlled by an Axis power (Vichy France) in World War II, until it was liberated by General De Gaulle (who some decades later also tried to liberate Qu\u00e9bec\u00a0:-) \u00a0 SP&M is listed in the IMM and addressed is if it were a country:, 64928=Noticed in July 2007: Brazil seems to have joined the countries that are putting the postal code as the bottom line, as you can see if you look at the current version of Formas de Endere\u00e7amento (link just below), although it seems the format described here is still accepted. Examples of the two formats (from the Brazil post website):, 145075=Prior to conversion, trailing zeroes in the postal code were commonly omitted, so people would often write 1 Berlin 20 for 1000 Berlin 20. This was more obvious with large cities that had three zeroes, but even smaller cities with only one trailing zero could have that digit dropped. So you could say that while the postal code had four digits, they were written as one to four digits., 145472=While the first German postal codes date from 1943, the 4-digit codes in West Germany were introduced on March 23, 1962. East Germany followed suit soon thereafter, but did not use postal district numbers after the city name, but instead incorporated them into the postal code. Therefore, there was a 1000 Berlin in the west and 1xxx numbers for the eastern parts of Berlin., 183056=The USPS, however, still lists the name of the country as SERBIA-MONTENEGRO (IMM Issue 34, May 14, 2007 Updated with Postal Bulletin Revisions Through February 28, 2008)., 140958=Links (verified 8 Feb 2012):, 50090=The postal system of Costa Rica is notoriously quirky. A system of postcodes is being instituted in two steps, beginning in 2007. A video (narrated in Spanish) is available on the Correos de Costa Rica website explaining the steps. The first is 5 digit postal code (c\u00f3digo postal) in which the first digit is the province (provincia), the second and third denote the county (cant\u00f3n), and the last two the district (distrito) within the cant\u00f3n. Then, since few Costa Rican streets have names and houses do not tend to have house numbers; a second step will create numeric codes for streets and addresses covering the whole country., 173593=I'm not sure if this actually applies to the newly independent Kosovo but it the only guidance we have at the moment. Nor is it clear what will happen to mail sent to Kosovo through Serbia, from which it broke away. Nor do we know what Kosovo will do, if anything, for postal codes (reported, April 2010, a set of postal codes has been created starting with 10000 for Pri\u0161tina)., 88242=Then in 1995 this became:, 337914=However, advice found at a now-defunct website in 2004 stated that for addresses outside of Dublin, the County should go on its own line as shown in these examples:, 7058=As of 2009, certain diplomatic sites have DPO (Diplomatic Post Office) addresses, similar to APO addresses (DPO AA, DPO AE, DPO AP, followed by Zip or, preferably, Zip+4), as in this example for the US Embassy in Rabat, Morocco:, 149666=Note that all street names are not compounds: some comprise an adjective with a noun, as in Kurze Stra\u00dfe (in 13585 Berlin) or Livl\u00e4ndische Stra\u00dfe (10715 Berlin); some comprise a preposition, an article, optional adjectives and a noun, as in In den neuen G\u00e4rten (12247 Berlin). A particular pitfal lurks in the -er suffix: normally, it signals an adjective as in Burgunder Stra\u00dfe (79104 Freiburg; from Burgund = Burgundy), but many proper names end in -er, these can constitute the 1st part of a compound, as in Burgunderstra\u00dfe (70435 Stuttgart; from Burgunder = burgundy wine). The only sure way to tell these cases apart is to consult the Postleitzahlenbuch (or to know the local history\u00a0;-) (The Burgunder Stra\u00dfe vs. Burgunderstra\u00dfe example stems from http://faql.de/typographie.html#bindestrich, though they present different evidence.), 214235=Note that there was a big spelling reform (for Romanization of Chinese names) in Peoples China in 1979, but not in Taiwan. Thus Peoples China uses Pinyin transcription, and the ROC uses Wade-Giles. Some examples:, 78868=Within Western Australia lies a small area calling itself the Hutt River Province Principality, which seceded from Western Australia and the Commonwealth of Australia in 1970 over a wheat-quota dispute. Whatever its legal and international standing, it has no listing in the USPS International Mail Manual, so mail from the USA to that area must be addressed via Northampton WA 6535 in Australia. For further info, search the Web for Hutt River., 182255=in which the first line is the person's name (Petar Petrovich), the second line is presumably the street and house number (Palmoticheva 027 008), the third line is the postcode and code (11000 Beograd = Belgrade; I'm not sure what the small notation is to the right of \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434), and the fourth line shows the new address code at the bottom right. The site is not clear about the relationship of the postcode and the address code (the example shows both the postcode and the address code in the same address, but the text says Instead of the existing postal code, a new address code is introduced), but the Universal Postal Unions writes the same address like this:, 15917=Links (last checked: 12 January 2013):, 213808=When I last looked (May 2012) the China Post website did not furnish any addressing guidelines., 172789=KOSOVO declared itself an independent republic on 17 February 2008. The USPS International Mail Manual (IMM Issue 34, May 14, 2007 Updated with Postal Bulletin Revisions Through February 28, 2008) says:, 218344=Hong Kong (Xianggang) became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the Peoples Republic of China July 1, 1997, but addressing conventions have not changed. Here's a sample Hong Kong address:, 317781=Falkland Islands inhabitants often find that their letters have transited the postal systems of places such as the Faroe Islands, Iceland or the most popular destination for lost Falklands mail, Falkirk in Scotland. The postcode should also make on-line shopping easier for Falklands residents, given that most Internet-purchasing services require a post or zip code before transactions can be completed. Postcodes are simultaneously being introduced today for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and British Antarctic Territory. Other UK Overseas Territories in the South Atlantic, namely Saint Helena and Ascension Island, have had postcodes since March 2002. The project was created with the help of the International Division of Royal Mail and the Universal Postal Union in Berne, Switzerland., 310741=As to Wales, Alan Perry reported in July 2001, There was yet another change to county names in Wales [in 1994]; places like Gwynedd and South Glamorgan etc no longer exist! The former 8 counties have been replaced by 22 county borough councils (and a few newly-named county councils). Addressing conventions from the Royal Mail Postal Address Book for Wales indicates addresses should be:, 308556=Scotland and Wales are separate countries within the United Kingdom, on the island of Britain. They use UK postal codes. You can write SCOTLAND or WALES as the bottom line of the address, since these are country names recognized by the USPS (Authority: IMM Issues 23-28, July 2000 - January 2003)., 225198=Singapore postal codes were changed from 4 to 6 digits in 1995. All the street signs also had to be changed, since they had 4-digit postcodes on them. Under the new system, each building in Singapore has its own unique postcode., 73160=(This section by Felipe Zapata Rold\u00e1n, 11 December 2005) \u00a0 In Colombia, the postal code system has not been implemented yet, but there's a plan to do it in the near future (postal codes exist but they are not used). A standard mailing address (residential, commercial, or industrial) looks like this:, 146645=or in Frank's copy of the Deutsche Bundespost Postleitzahlenbuch ( onsite only :-) \u00a0 You can convert pre-1993 4-digit postalcodes to current 5-digit ones here:, 89526=Postal addresses that appear in printed matter, databases, and on the Web can be found in all three formats. CEN (see Links at the end of this section) recommends in Annex C of EN 14142-1:2003 (a standard for addresses) that cross-border mail should be prefixed by the ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code where the postcode precedes the locality in the destination country., 218684=Hong Kong is still listed in the USPS IMM, and in fact (as of May 2004, and checked again in June 2009) Hong Kong Post still lists its own address as:, 155692=Although Germany's borders have changed repeatedly, it has always been subdivided into states (L\u00e4nder). German states are not used in postal addresses, but nevertheless sometimes we find addresses in which a state name is used instead of the country, e.g. Augsburg, Bavaria. Such addresses should be converted to omit the state name and to include a postcode, which can be looked up at sites in the Links at the end of this section or in the Postleitzahlenbuch. Germany's current states are shown in the following table. When the English name of a German state or city is different from the German name, the English name is shown in parentheses. PLZ is the approximate postal code range for reality checking. January 2013... This table now incorporates an update of the PLZs from Jens Peter Hammer. My original values are in bold; either these were not very accurate, or a once-simple system has become more complicated, or some combination:, 343079=Irish mail delivery is modern and highly automated. The full address is scanned for routing and delivery. Postcodes are not used because they are not needed; all delivery points are in the postal database. In 2002 there was a plan to set up an Irish postcode system but it seemed to have been dropped (ComReg was for it, and An\u00a0Post against), but then revived again in 2003., 181895=On January 1, 2005, Serbian Post introduced a six-digit address code for each Serbian postal address, to replace the previous 5-digit postal code. The website shows the following sample address:, 321339=In February 2010 a reader offered the following clarification:, 85141=References (all good as of 10 January 2007):, 144719=Alex Bochannek adds, As part of the 1993 PLZ [Postleitzahlen \u2013 Postal Codes] conversion, the trailing postal district number was dropped. For example, 1000 Berlin 20 covered part of the Berlin district of Spandau. After the 1993 conversion a finer granularity was possible and 13591 Berlin was assigned to an even smaller part of Spandau., 78128=(Doug Moncur reports in 2012, \"However some of your information for the ACT in Australia is wrong. Australia Post doesn't really believe Canberra exists so while a lot of suburbs have 26xx codes, some have 29xx codes. This used to be limited to Tuggeranong but they've started allocating 29xx codes to new outer north suburbs as well, eg Crace - see this site for a list.... And PO Boxes can be PO Box or LPO Box - LPO being a Local Post Office. Most times PO Box will do just fine, but here on campus they recommend LPO if you have a private box to make it clear you want to pick your mail up from the post office in the Student's Union building...\", 198546=A piece of Russia, the Kaliningradskaya Oblast, or Kaliningrad Free Economic Zone, lies on the Baltic coast, about 500km west of contiguous Russia, with Latvia, Lithuania, and Belarus in between, and sharing a border with Poland. The city of Kaliningrad is the former K\u00f6nigsberg, once capital of East Prussia and later part of Germany, and was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1945, becoming the USSR's main Baltic port. Today it is the Hong Kong of Russia. It is addressed like any other Russian city:, 87826=Beginning in 1994, car codes were supposed to be replaced by ISO 3166 Alpha-2 codes, but it seems this was not done to any great extent outside of Scandinavia. Thus for some decades (say 1970-1994) a letter to Sweden would have a City and Country line like the following (note: two spaces recommended after the postcode):, 17261=Canadian postal humor: Canada Post doesn't really charge 32 cents for a stamp. It's 2 cents for postage and 30 cents for storage. (Gerald Regan, Cabinet Minister, 31 Dec 1983 Financial Post), 302304=Bernard Treves Brown adds (in April 2003) that \u201cYou might care to note that the post office has invented 'Virtual Post Towns'; thus my address is:, 275395=Here's a summary table for the Islands of Britain and Ireland, the Crown Dependencies, and the British Overseas Territories. The notation and formats used are the very latest recommended by Royal Mail (except Ireland, which has nothing to do with Royal Mail). As always, links are to the appropriate postal authorities. British Antarctic Territory is not included because \"you can't get there from here\" (the USPS does not recognize it as a destination). Similarly for the British Indian Ocean Territory (Diego Garcia, etc), Akrotiri and Dhekelia (on Cyprus), etc, which are SBAs (Sovereign Base Areas) under British military jurisdiction, so use BFPO numbers. Akrotiri is BFPO 57 and Dhekelia BFPO 58. BFPO has assigned a number of 485 to Diego Garcia as a part of a numbering system for Royal Navy ships; the \"ship\" is Naval Party (NP) 1002. NP 1002 is not an actual vessel, but the the name for the group of Royal Navy and Royal Marines who run the civilian government on Diego Garcia. They are headed by a Royal Navy officer who represents Britain on the island. The US Navy describes the situation better here. The BFPO number is here., 28488=Anguilla has a single postal code, AI-2640 for everybody., 190610=Lithuania switched from a 4-digit to a 5-digit zipcode about 2005, and now offers an English-language postal website, http://www.post.lt/en/, including postcode lookup., 171914=Between 1990 and 2006, what had been the Federated (or Federal) Peoples Republic of Yugoslavia \u2013 a federation of six Republics (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia) and two Socialist Autonomous Regions (Kosovo and Vojvodina) \u2013 became the following countries (see INDEX for native-language, alternative, and former names). Prior to 1990, the ISO 3166-1 code for Yugoslavia was YU; after that each republic received its own code. From 1990 to 2006, the republics of Serbia and Montenegro were federated into a single country having code CS (which had formally belonged to Czechoslovakia); in 2006 they separated and received the codes shown below. As always, the spelling of country names for addressing purposes is the USPS spelling since, after all, it is the USPS that must recognize the country name., 20118=One can expect that mail addressed to the Netherlands Antilles will be delivered correctly for the near future, though, especially since (as of late February 2011), the USPS IMM has not been updated about these developments and still has NETHERLANDS ANTILLES as well as NETHERLANDS WEST INDIES in its countries list., 330170=David Gowdy writes (Oct 2000), \u201cRural townland names predate modern postal thinking. In Fermanagh for many years the Council refused to allocate roadnames or postcodes and insisted in retaining these traditional names. Naturally these townlands also had little relationship to the road layout, and houses had no actual numbers \u2013 the address was like:, 316619=The British Overseas Territories are Anguilla, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Pitcairn, Saint Helena and its Dependencies, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Most of these are covered in the CARIBBEAN and ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC sections. Some of these territories (Saint Helena, South Georgia, the Falkland Islands) or their dependencies (such as Ascension Island) participate in the UK postcode system; Ken Westmoreland sends the following clipping from the Gibraltar Chronicle, 20 May 2003:, 87300=After World War II and up until the mid-1990s, all European postcodes included country-code prefixes. These were originally United Nations car codes (one, two, or three letters), kept in an annex, Car (Or Road) Distinguishing Signs, to the 1949/68 United Nations Conventions on Road Traffic, adopted in part by the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT). These codes were not accepted by the Universal Postal Union as a world standard, but were widely used anyway., 169387=On New Years Day, 1993, Czechoslovakia (ISO 3166 Alpha-2 code CS) split into two countries: The Czech Republic (CZ, containing Prague, Brno, Plzn, etc), and the Slovak Republic (SK, containing Bratislava). The new postal codes are as follows:, 191830=This form fell into disuse about 2000, at least in Russia and Ukraine, which have switched to the same minor-to-major top-to-bottom presentation used in most other places, while other former Soviet republics such as Kyrgyzstan still use the major-to-minor form [more about Kyrgyzstan]., 231875=Here is a table of countries in the geographic Middle East (the Arabian Peninsula east of the Bosporus, south of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan (which are listed in the Former USSR section), plus Iran, but not including Egypt, which is listed in the Africa section because most of it is on the African continent), showing the USPS name for each country, the ISO and Car codes (as in the table for Europe), the City Line format (L stands for an uppercase letter, n stands for a numeric digit, italic words such as town are to be replaced appropriately, and punctuation and non-italic characters are literal), and a sample City Line taken, in most cases, from the Universal Postal Union. For long and other forms of the country names, see the Index. Links from country names are to postal authorities, if known, otherwise to other postal information pages for the country., 143413=German postal codes are five digits, possibly prefixed by DE- (for Deutschland, formerly just D). Prior to 1991 (the union of DDR and the Bundesrepublik), the prefixes for the 4-digit codes were D- (for the Federal Republic (West)), and DDR- (for the Democratic Republic (East)). Then, in the united Federal Republic, the prefixes were O- (for East) and W- (for West), to distinguish the conflicting 4-digit postcodes of East and West. Then on July 1, 1993, a new comprehensive Germany-wide 5-digit system took effect and all the German addresses in all the databases in the world had to be converted., 88703=The situation is definitely confusing with postal standards, guidelines, and examples in flux and in conflict. The Universal Postal Union recommends that the ISO Alpha-2 Country Code be used for international mail, and that the country code prefix be omitted on domestic mail (e.g. within Italy), but of course the local standards of each country prevail, and to confound matters, Alpha-2 codes can change or (worse) be recycled; for example, Czechoslovakia was CS but when it split into the Czech and Slovak Republics in 1993 the codes became became CZ and SK, respectively; then in 2003 Serbia and Montenegro, which had inherited YU from Yugoslovia, had its code changed to CS (Crna Gora i Srbja), and then in 2006 Serbia and Montenegro split and received the codes RS and ME, respectively., 103420=The Islands originally sought incorporation into Sweden, but the League of Nations decided to uphold Finland's territorial integrity. However, as part of Finland the Islands have far more autonomy than they would have had as part of Sweden, including having their own postal service since 1984. Note that in Swedish, an official language in the rest of Finland, the country is known as Republiken Finland. (Easier to guess than 'Suomen Tasavalta'). USPS IMM Issue 29, July 2003, Updated With Postal Bulletin Revisions Through March 4, 2004, lists ALAND ISLAND as a valid country-name for postal delivery; I do not recall seeing it previously (prior to May 2004, the advice given here was to address through Finland, which probably still works, as I expect that mail addressed to ALAND ISLAND from the USA goes to Finland anyway). The UPU says (07/2003) it is necessary to add the code 'AX' before the postcode, as in the example., 307662=Other Links of Interest (verified 2013-01-13):}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The following table shows a sampling of City Line formats. Punctuation shown in the Format column is to be taken literally: While the United States might ignore the destination city in international mail, other countries do not necessarily do so. For example, mail from England to Los Angeles is sent directly to Los Angeles, whereas a letter to New York goes on a flight to New York. The journey of a letter from Nome (Alaska) to Provideniya (Siberia), if sent westward rather than east, could be 23,000 miles shorter if the USPS processed the city line. A handful of national postal authorities now recommend writing postal code on a line by itself, above or below the city line (Ecuador, Ukraine, Hungary... and now also the UK). In such cases, the City Line occupies two lines. As far as I can tell, this is a recent development and is largely ignored in many of the countries that recommend it (e.g. Russia). In any case, it makes formatting and parsing international addresses all the more complicated, and might also cause addresses to exceed address-line limits, where they did not before (e.g. for postal scanners, databases, forms, or window envelopes).
