This was mainly driven by lower sales and lease revenues due to the overall weaker economy within Europe. This was slightly offset by higher appraisal fees. Commissions, fees and other incentives for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2001, increased by $1.8\u00a0million or 12.3% compared to the three months ended September\u00a030, 2000 due to an increased number of producers, primarily within the U.K. In addition, producer compensation is typically fixed in nature and does not decrease as a result of a decline in revenues. Operating, administrative, and other decreased by $1.7\u00a0million or 8.2% due to various cost containment measures put in place during the quarter., 170795=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A subsidiary of the Company has a credit agreement with Residential Funding Corporation (RFC). The credit agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of up to $175.0\u00a0million, and bears interest at 1.00% per annum over LIBOR. The agreement expires on August\u00a031, 2002. During the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2001, the Company had a maximum of $157.2\u00a0million revolving line of credit principal outstanding. The Company had a participation agreement with RFC whereby RFC agreed to purchase a 99% participation interest in any eligible multifamily mortgage loans owned by the Company and outstanding at quarter-end (Participation Agreement). The Participation Agreement expired August\u00a031, 2001. At September\u00a030, 2001, the Company had $72.2\u00a0million warehouse line of credit outstanding, which is included in short-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company also had a $72.2\u00a0million warehouse receivable. Subsequent to September\u00a030, 2001, the warehouse line of credit was repaid with the proceeds from the warehouse receivable., 181020=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As part of the merger, the Company issued 255,477 warrants to purchase shares of Class\u00a0B Common Stock with an exercise price of $30.00 per share. These warrants expire August\u00a027, 2007. The Company also issued 1,520,207 options to acquire Class\u00a0A Common Stock at an exercise price of $16.00 per share. These options will vest and become exercisable in 20% increments over a five-year period ending July\u00a020, 2006. All options will become fully vested and exercisable upon a change in control of the Company., 379500=CBRE HOLDING, INC.

This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December\u00a015, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application encouraged. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement on its results of operations and financial position., 459743=CBRE HOLDING, INC. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY\u00a01 THROUGH JULY\u00a020, 2001 (Dollars in Thousands) (Predecessor), 556955=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Operating, administrative and other on a consolidated basis was $380.4\u00a0million, a decrease of $10.8\u00a0million or 2.8%, compared to the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2000. This decline is due to lower bonus incentives and profit share attributable to the Company's lower results, cost cutting measures and operational efficiencies put into place in May 2001 and an organizational restructure implemented after the merger transaction was completed, that included the reduction of administrative staff in corporate and divisional headquarters and the scaling back of unprofitable operations., 149446=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The accompanying unaudited consolidated statement of financial position as of September\u00a030, 2001, the consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2001, and consolidated statement of operations and cash flows for the period from February\u00a020, 2001 (inception) through September\u00a030, 2001, reflect the consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company from inception and also include the consolidated financial position, statement of operations and cash flows of CBRE from the the date of the merger and include all material adjustments required under the purchase method of accounting. In accordance with Regulation\u00a0S-X, CBRE is considered the predecessor to the Company. As such, the historical financial statements of CBRE prior to the merger are included in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, including the consolidated financial position of CBRE as of December\u00a031, 2000, the consolidated statements of operations for the periods from July\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001 and from January\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001 and for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2000, and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the period from January\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001 and for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2000 (collectively \"Predecessor financial statements\"). The Predecessor financial statements have not been adjusted to reflect the acquisition of CBRE by the Company. As such, the consolidated financial statements of the Company after the merger are not directly comparable to the Predecessor financial statements prior to the merger., 5242=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The number of shares of Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B common stock outstanding at October\u00a031, 2001 was 1,742,468 and 12,649,813, respectively., 624508=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Between November\u00a012 and December\u00a06, 2000, five putative class actions were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County by various of CBRE's stockholders against the Company, CBRE, its directors and the buying group which has taken CBRE private. A similar action was also filed on November\u00a017, 2000 in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Los Angeles. These actions all alleged that the offering price for shares of CBRE's common stock was unfair and inadequate and sought injunctive relief or rescission of the transaction and, in the alternative, money damages., 140708=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the effective time of the merger, CBRE became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of CBRE was converted into the right to receive $16.00 in cash, except for (i)\u00a0shares of common stock of CBRE owned by the Company and Blum CB immediately prior to the merger, which totaled 7,967,774 shares, which were cancelled, (ii)\u00a0treasury shares and shares of common stock of CBRE owned by any of its subsidiaries, which were cancelled, and (iii)\u00a0shares of CBRE held by stockholders who perfect appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Delaware law. All shares of common stock of CBRE outstanding prior to the merger were acquired by Holding, and these shares were subsequently cancelled. Immediately prior to the merger, the following, collectively referred to as the buying group, contributed to the Company all the shares of CBRE's common stock that he or it directly owned in exchange for an equal number of shares of Class\u00a0B common stock of the Company: RCBA Strategic FS Equity Partners\u00a0III,\u00a0L.P. (FSEP) a Delaware limited partnership, Blum Strategic Partners II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, FS Equity Partners International,\u00a0L.P. (FSEP International) a Delaware limited partnership, The Koll Holding Company, a California corporation, Frederic V. Malek, a director of the Company and CBRE, Raymond E. Wirta, the Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company and CBRE, and W. Brett White, the President and a director of the Company and CBRE. Such shares of common stock of CBRE, which totaled 7,967,774 shares of common stock, were then cancelled. In addition, the Company offered to purchase for cash options outstanding to acquire common stock of CBRE at a purchase price per option equal to the greater of the amount by which $16.00 exceeded the exercise price of the option, if at all, or $1.00. In connection with the merger, CBRE purchased its outstanding options on behalf of the Company, which were recorded as merger related and other non recurring charges by CBRE in the period from January\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001, and are not reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations of the Company., 557616=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Merger-related and other nonrecurring charges were $25.4\u00a0million for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2001, with no charges incurred in the prior year. This included merger-related costs of $16.5\u00a0million, the write-off of e-business investments of $6.1\u00a0million, as well as severance costs of $2.8\u00a0million related to the Company's cost reduction program instituted in May\u00a02001., 618160=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tranche A facility will fully amortize by July\u00a020, 2007 through quarterly principal payments over 6\u00a0years, which total $7.5\u00a0million each year through June\u00a030, 2003 and $8.75\u00a0million each year thereafter through July\u00a020, 2007. The Tranche B facility requires quarterly principal payments of $0.5\u00a0million, with the remaining outstanding principal due on July\u00a018, 2008. The revolving line of credit requires the repayment of any outstanding balance for a period of 45 consecutive days commencing on any day as determined by the Company in the month of December of each year. The total amount outstanding under the credit facility included in senior secured term loans, current maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets was $255.2\u00a0million at September\u00a030, 2001. The weighted average interest rate was 7.4% at September\u00a030, 2001., 5853=CBRE HOLDING,\u00a0INC. FORM 10-Q September\u00a030, 2001 TABLE OF CONTENTS, 605843=activities due to the low interest rate environment in the US. Commissions, fees and other incentives decreased by $32.9\u00a0million or 9.2% for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2001, compared to the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2000, primarily due to the lower lease and sales revenues within North America. The decline in revenues also resulted in lower variable commission expense within this division as compared to prior year. These declines were offset by higher insurance and benefit costs for producers in the US, which is included as a component of commissions expense. Commissions as a percentage of revenues remained comparable between years at 48.8% for the current year and 49.1% for the prior year. Operating, administrative, and other decreased by $6.6\u00a0million or 2.3% as a result of cost reduction and efficiency measures undertaken in the current year., 190103=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In connection with the merger with Blum CB, and as part of the financing of the merger, CBRE assumed an aggregate of $229.0\u00a0million in Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011. These Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company's future senior subordinated unsecured indebtedness. The Notes are effectively subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the Notes. The Notes are guaranteed on a full, unconditional, joint and several basis by the Company, CBRE and CBRE's wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries., 621574=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company has short-term borrowings of $104.8\u00a0million and $9.2\u00a0million with related weighted average interest rates of 5.0% and 7.3% as of September\u00a030, 2001 and December\u00a031, 2000, respectively., 549924=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Revenues on a consolidated basis decreased by $50.4\u00a0million or 15.4% for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2001, compared to the three months ended September\u00a030, 2000. This was mainly driven by a $28.2\u00a0million decrease in lease revenue, as well as a $17.6\u00a0million decline in sales revenue. These decreases were primarily attributable to the Company's North American operation in response to a softening economy as well as the tragic events that began on September\u00a011, 2001. This resulted in clients delaying or canceling transactions. The revenue declines were slightly offset by a 15.1% rise in appraisal fees driven by increased refinancing activities due to a decline in interest rates in the US, and by increased fees in our European operation., 680283=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CBRE filed a Current Report on Form\u00a08-K on July\u00a05, 2001 dated July\u00a05, 2001, announcing that as a part of the financing of the proposed merger of CBRE with Blum CB Corporation, the Company has offered in a private placement $65,000,000 of its 16% Senior Notes due July\u00a020, 2011 and 339,820 shares of its Class\u00a0A common stock. The related Offering Circular includes a \"Recent Developments\" update with respect to CBRE., 549570=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company reported a consolidated net loss of $27.7\u00a0million for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2001 on revenues of $276.2\u00a0million compared to consolidated net income of $7.0\u00a0million on revenues of $326.5\u00a0million for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2000., 163597=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company has $229.0\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of 111/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due June\u00a015, 2011 (the Notes), which were issued and sold by Blum CB Corp. for approximately $225.6\u00a0million, net of discount, on June\u00a07, 2001 and assumed by CBRE in connection with the merger. The Notes require semi-annual payments of interest in arrears on June\u00a015 and December\u00a015, commencing on December\u00a015, 2001, and are redeemable in whole or in part on or after June\u00a015, 2006 at 105.625% of par on that date and at declining prices thereafter. In addition, before June\u00a015, 2004, the Company may redeem up to 35.0% of the originally issued amount of the Notes at 1111/4% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, solely with the net cash proceeds from public equity offerings. In the event of a change of control, the Company is obligated to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a redemption price of 101.0% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Company and CBRE's domestic subsidiaries. The effective yield on the Notes is 11.5%. The amount included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets less unamortized discount was $225.7\u00a0million at September\u00a030, 2001., 632228=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In June\u00a02001, the FASB issued SFAS No.\u00a0143, \"Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.\" This statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or) the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of leases. The statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of its fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June\u00a015, 2002, although earlier application is encouraged. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement on its results of operations and financial position., 170521=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company has short-term borrowings of $104.8\u00a0million and $9.2\u00a0million with related weighted average interest rates of 5.0% and 7.3% as of September\u00a030, 2001 and December\u00a031, 2000, respectively., 173186=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deferred Compensation Plan (the DCP).\u00a0\u00a0In 1994, CBRE implemented the DCP. Under the DCP, a select group of management and highly compensated employees can defer the payment of all or a portion of their compensation (including any bonuses) and have it invested in stock fund units, a series of mutual funds within an insurance policy or an interest bearing account. As part of the merger, the DCP was amended so that each stock fund unit represented the right to receive one share of Class\u00a0A common stock of the Company. Each participant in the DCP who was a US employee or an independent contractor in the specified states and had pre-merger vested stock fund units prior to the merger was permitted to make one of the following elections: (1)\u00a0convert the value of his or her pre-merger vested stock fund units, based upon a value of $16.00 per stock unit, into any of the insurance mutual fund or interest index fund alternatives provided under the DCP, or (2)\u00a0continue to hold the vested stock fund units in his or her account under the DCP. In accordance with a change in control provision included in the terms of the DCP, shares of stock fund units associated with the 1999 Company matching contribution, which were unvested prior to the merger, became vested upon completion of the merger, but remained as stock fund units. Vested stock fund units, including those that vested due to the change in control, are included in goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September\u00a030, 2001. The above accounting treatment is in accordance with Financial Interpretation Number (FIN) 44 \"Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation.\", 178775=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An important part of the strategy for the Company's investment management business involves investing its own capital in certain real estate investments with its clients.

This decrease was primarily due to lower lease revenue of $25.4\u00a0million and decreased sales revenue of $15.5\u00a0million. These declines are primarily a result of a lower number of transactions completed, caused by a softening economy as well as the tragic events that began on September\u00a011th. Other revenues also declined due to the sale of loan servicing rights in the prior year quarter. These decreases were slightly offset by higher appraisal fees driven by increased refinancing activities due to the low interest rate environment in the US. Commissions, fees and other incentives decreased by $24.6\u00a0million or 18.2% for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2001, compared to the three months ended September\u00a030, 2000, primarily due to the decline in lease and sales revenues. The decline in revenues also resulted in lower variable commission expense within this division as compared to prior year quarter. Commissions as a percentage of revenues remained comparable at 50.6% for the current quarter compared to 50.9% for the prior year quarter. Operating, administrative, and other decreased by $13.5\u00a0million or 13.4% for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2001, compared to the three months ended September\u00a030, 2000 reflecting the Company's cost reduction efforts., 554218=Nine Months Ended September\u00a030, 2001 Compared to Nine Months Ended September\u00a030, 2000, 140052=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On July\u00a020, 2001, the Company acquired (the merger) CBRE pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May\u00a031, 2001 (the merger agreement) among the Company, CBRE and Blum CB. Blum CB was merged with and into CBRE, with CBRE being the surviving corporation. The operations of the Company after the merger are substantially the same as the operations of CBRE prior to the merger.

The Credit Facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all their assets. The credit facility includes the Tranche A term facility of $50.0\u00a0million, maturing in 2007; the Tranche B term facility of $185.0\u00a0million, maturing in 2008; and the revolving line of credit of $90.0\u00a0million, including revolving credit loans, letters of credit and a swingline loan facility, maturing in 2007. Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities will bear interest at varying rates based on the Company's option, at either LIBOR plus 3.25% or the alternate base rate plus 2.25%, in the case of Tranche A and the revolving facility, and LIBOR plus 3.75% or the alternate base rate plus 2.75%, in the case of Tranche B facility.

Rather, goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fair-value based test. Additionally, an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, regardless of the acquirer's intent to do so.

Sales revenue also declined by $31.0\u00a0million during the current year. The lower revenues are primarily attributable to the Company's North American operation in response to a softening economy as well as the tragic events that began on September\u00a011, 2001. This resulted in clients delaying or canceling transactions. However, the European operation also experienced lower sale and lease revenues compared to prior year. These decreases were slightly offset by a $7.4\u00a0million increase in loan origination and servicing fees, as well as a $6.4\u00a0million increase in property and facilities management fees. Appraisal fees also increased by 11.1% driven by increased refinancing activities due to a decline in the interest rates in the US, and increased fees in the European operation., 175815=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Capital Accumulation Plan (The Cap Plan).\u00a0\u00a0The Cap Plan is a defined contribution profit sharing plan under section\u00a0401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and is CBRE's only such plan.

The Company's ability to use NOLs has been limited for the period from July\u00a021, 2001 to December\u00a031, 2001 and will be in subsequent years because CBRE experienced a change in ownership greater than 50% on July\u00a020, 2001. As a result of the ownership change, the limitation will be approximately $5.2\u00a0million of its NOLs for the period from July\u00a021, 2001 to December\u00a031, 2001 and $11.2\u00a0million in year 2002 and in each subsequent year until fully utilized. The amount of NOLs is, in any event, subject to some uncertainty until the statute of limitations lapses after their utilization to offset taxable income., 177362=similar action was also filed on November\u00a017, 2000 in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Los Angeles. These actions all alleged that the offering price for shares of CBRE's common stock was unfair and inadequate and sought injunctive relief or rescission of the transaction and, in the alternative, money damages., 175013=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each stock fund unit that was unvested prior to the merger continued to be held in participants' accounts but after the merger represented the right to receive one share of Class\u00a0A common stock of the Company. These unvested stock fund units have been accounted for as a deferred compensation asset, of which $2.0\u00a0million and $4.0\u00a0million are included in other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September\u00a030, 2001. The deferred compensation asset will be amortized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting period for such stock fund units in accordance with FIN 44. After completion of the merger, no new deferrals are allowed in stock fund units., 188160=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing the net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding of 11,865,459 and 20,806,651 for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and 4,921,204 and 20,834,943 for the period from February\u00a020, 2001 (Inception) to September\u00a030, 2001 and the nine months ended September\u00a02000, respectively, and 21,194,674 and 21,306,584 for the period from July\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001 and the period from January\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001, respectively. The Company's outstanding common stock equivalents were antidilutive during the current year. For the three and nine month periods ended September\u00a030, 2000, the computation of diluted earnings per share further assumes the dilutive effect of 74,441 and 82,601 common stock equivalents, respectively, which consists principally of stock options. Due to the change in equity structure as a result of the merger, the current year per share information is not comparable to that of the prior year., 193632=CBRE HOLDING, INC. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING BALANCE SHEET AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 (Dollars in Thousands) (Company), 604833=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Revenue decreased by $63.2\u00a0million or 8.6% for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2001, compared to the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2000. The decrease was primarily due to a $44.2\u00a0million decrease in lease revenues and a $24.3\u00a0million decline in sales revenues due to a lower number of transactions completed during the current year due to the softening economy and the tragic events which began on September\u00a011, 2001. This was slightly offset by an increase in loan origination and servicing fees of $7.4\u00a0million, as well as higher appraisal fees driven by increased refinancing, 137464=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company purchased all of the outstanding common stock of CBRE in exchange for cash and common stock of the Company. The non-cash componenet of the merger consideration included approximately $157.1\u00a0million in common stock and payables. The payables will be paid subsequent to September\u00a030, 2001., 551816=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Operating, administrative and other on a consolidated basis was $116.8\u00a0million, a decrease of $16.5\u00a0million or 12.4% as compared to the third quarter of 2000. This decline is due to lower bonus incentives and profit share attributable to the Company's lower results, cost cutting measures and operational efficiencies put into place in May 2001 and an organizational restructure implemented after the merger transaction was completed, that included the reduction of administrative staff in corporate and divisional headquarters and the scaling back of unprofitable operations., 626591=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A majority of the European Union member countries converted to a common currency, the \"Euro,\" on January\u00a01, 1999. The existing legacy currencies of the participating countries will continue to be accepted until January\u00a01, 2002. The Company does not expect the introduction of the Euro to have a significant impact on its market or the manner in which it conducts business, and believes the related impact on its financial results will not be material. Approximately 4.3% of the Company's 2001 business was transacted in the participating member countries. The Company is currently using both the Euro and legacy currencies to conduct business in these member countries., 151225=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unaudited pro forma results of the Company assuming the merger had occurred as of January\u00a01, 2000 are presented below. These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been, and may not be indicative of future operating results (in thousands, except per share amounts):, 547136=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The results of operations of the Company for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2001 have been derived by combining the results of operations of the Company for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2001 with the results of operations of CBRE, prior to the merger, from July\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001, the date of the merger. The results of operations for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2001 reflect the combination of the results of operations of the Company for the period from February\u00a020, 2001 to September\u00a030, 2001 with the results of operations for CBRE prior to the merger, from January\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001. The results of operations and cash flows of CBRE prior to the merger incorporated in this discussion are the historical results and cash flows of CBRE, the predecessor to the Company. These CBRE results do not reflect any purchase accounting adjustments included in the results of the Company after the merger, and are thus not directly comparable. Because of the effects of purchase accounting applied as a result of the merger and the additional interest expense associated with the debt incurred to finance the merger, the results of operations of the Company are not comparable in all respects to the results of operations prior to the merger. However, the Company's management believes a discussion of the operations by combining the results of the Company and CBRE is more meaningful as the Company's operating revenues and expenses have not been affected by the MBO and splitting up the results between pre- and post-merger periods would make comparisons of the operating trends to the prior year very different., 144006=$65.0\u00a0million to DLJ Investment Funding,\u00a0Inc. and other purchasers, which units consist of $65.0\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of 16% Senior Notes due 2011 and 339,820 shares of Class\u00a0A common stock of the Company, (v)\u00a0the issuance and sale by Blum CB of $229.0\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of 111/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 for $225.6\u00a0million (which were assumed by CBRE in connection with the merger) and (vi)\u00a0borrowings by CBRE under a new $325.0\u00a0million senior credit agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston and other lenders., 603587=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Revenue decreased by $1.2\u00a0million or 6.1% for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2001, compared to the three months ended September\u00a030, 2000 due primarily to lower incentive fees from sold properties. This was slightly offset by stronger sales revenue in Australia. Commissions, fees and other incentives increased by $0.7\u00a0million or 8.8% compared to the three months ended September\u00a030, 2000. Excluding Australia, producer compensation is typically fixed in nature and does not decrease as a result of a decline in revenues. Operating, administrative, and other decreased by $1.2\u00a0million or 10.8% for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2001, compared to the three months ended September\u00a030, 2000 due mainly to lower personnel requirements and other cost containment measures taken during the quarter., 300662=CBRE HOLDING, INC. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 (Dollars in Thousands) (Company), 606917=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Revenue decreased by $6.0\u00a0million or 5.2% for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2001, compared to the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2000. This was mainly driven by lower sales and lease revenues due to the overall weakness in the European economy. Commissions, fees and other incentives increased by $1.9\u00a0million or 4.5% for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2001, compared to the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2000 due primarily to a higher number of producers, mainly in the U.K. In addition, producer compensation is typically fixed in nature and does not decrease with a decline in revenues. Operating, administrative, and other decreased by $2.5\u00a0million or 4.0% for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2001, compared to the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2000 attributable mainly to the cost reduction measures taken during the current year., 396082=CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 (Dollars in Thousands) (Predecessor), 553348=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consolidated interest expense was $15.3\u00a0million, an increase of $4.3\u00a0million or 39.6% over the third quarter of 2000. This is attributable to the change in debt structure as a result of the merger., 559479=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsequent to the merger transaction, the Company reorganized its business segments as part of its efforts to reduce costs and streamline its operations. The Company now reports its operations through three geographically organized segments: (1)\u00a0The Americas, (2)\u00a0Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and (3)\u00a0Asia Pacific. The Americas consist of the United States, Canada, Mexico, and operations located in Central and South America. EMEA mainly consists of Europe, while Asia Pacific includes the operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Previously, the Company reported its segments based on the applicable type of revenue transaction. This included the Transaction Management, Financial Services and Management Services segments. Americas current year results include a nonrecurring pre-tax gain of $5.6\u00a0million from the sale of mortgage fund contracts, as well as merger-related and other nonrecurring charges of $24.5\u00a0million. Prior year results include a $4.7\u00a0million nonrecurring pre-tax gain on the sale of certain non-strategic assets. Current year results for Asia Pacific include merger-related and non-recurring charges of $0.8\u00a0million. The results of operations of the Company for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2001 have been derived by combining the Company's results with the results of operations of CBRE prior to the merger, from July\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001, the date of the merger. The results of operations for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2001 reflect the combination of the results of operations of the Company with the results of operations of CBRE prior to the merger, from January\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001. The following unaudited table summarizes the Company's revenue, cost and expenses, and operating (loss) income by operating segment for the periods ended September\u00a030, 2001 and 2000.

As of October\u00a02, 2001, the parties to the Delaware litigation entered into a settlement agreement that was filed with the appropriate court in Delaware. However, the Delaware court has not yet approved the settlement. Furthermore, the parties involved in the California lawsuit have not agreed to a settlement., 634349=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Portions of this Form\u00a010-Q, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(CBRE) pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May\u00a031, 2001 (the merger agreement) among the Company, CBRE and Blum CB Corp. (Blum CB), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Blum CB was merged with and into CBRE, with CBRE being the surviving corporation.

During the period from January\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001, CBRE recorded merger-related and other non recurring charges of $22.1\u00a0million which includes merger-related costs of $16.4\u00a0million, severance costs of $2.8\u00a0million related to CBRE's cost reduction program instituted in May\u00a02001, as well as the write-off of an e-investment of $2.9\u00a0million, 191564=July\u00a01, 2001 through July\u00a020, 2001, the period from January\u00a01, 2001 through July\u00a020, 2001, and the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2000; and condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the period from February\u00a020, 2001 (inception) to September\u00a030, 2001, the period from January\u00a01, 2001 to July\u00a020, 2001 and the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2000 of (a)\u00a0Holding, the Parent, (b)\u00a0CBRE, which is the subsidiary issuer (c)\u00a0the guarantor subsidiaries, (d)\u00a0the nonguarantor subsidiaries, and (e)\u00a0the Company on a consolidated basis; and}",
