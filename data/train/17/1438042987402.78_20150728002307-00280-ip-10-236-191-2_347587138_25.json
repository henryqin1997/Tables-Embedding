The HPV PCR tests are research tests. The HPV laboratory followed strict research QC/QA and was CLIA certified August 2008. Detailed quality control and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed QA/QC protocols. The analytical methods are described in the Description of the Laboratory Methodology section., 4041=The analysis of NHANES 2005\u20132006 laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2005\u20132006 Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights. Certain sensitive data on respondents under 18 years of age (e.g. HPV typing results, sexual behavior variables) are not included in the public use files. These data may be requested as described in the NHANES guidelines. The phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such as the conditions precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and phlebotomy files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN., 9330=Reducing the prevalence of HPV infection is a Developmental Healthy People 2010 objective: \u201cReducing the number of new HPV cases can help minimize the overall number of cases of high risk subtypes associated with cervical cancer in females...\u201d Detection and typing of HPV DNA in vaginal swabs (in conjunction with testing of NHANES sera for HPV antibody) will allow evaluation of trends in prevalence of type-specific HPV infection by age, sexual behavior, and race/ethnicity. Two HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix) are licensed and recommended for use in girls and women. Routine vaccination is recommended for girls 11 or 12 years of age, and catch-up vaccination through 26 years. One vaccine (Gardasil) is licensed and available for boys and men. As vaccine becomes more widely used, the national prevalence of HPV infection will be critical for evaluating vaccination strategies in the United States.}",
