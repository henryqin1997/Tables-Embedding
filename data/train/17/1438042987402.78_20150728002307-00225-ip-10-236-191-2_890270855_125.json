Agriculture still plays a huge part in the university but they have expanded in all other areas to become a powerhouse in education. Sports and extra curricular activities are also important at USU, come spend some time here and you'll be proud to call yourself an Aggie."

The average student spends about 8-12 grand a year for both semester on living here and that's if money is no option. That is about an average of 2000 on tuition each semester, 1600 on housing, 1000 on food, and about 500 for books and what not. The travel here by the way is completely free. All bus systems for city and campus are free for all to ride. Believe me this is really worth your money, 181862=Apply now! If you apply before the December 1st deadline, you automatically receive academic scholarships if you're eligible. I currently have half tuition because I applied early. Also, live on campus for at least your first year. There's a lot that you can get involved in with Housing and Residence Life, AND you're close to your classes. I could wake up five minutes before class any day of the week and still get to class on time - it's reassuring. Get involved and go to events, because they happen alllll the time and they're an absolute blast! Also, pay attention when anybody or anything says the words free Aggie Ice Cream, because they are said often, and they are beautiful. Aggie Ice Cream is like food for your soul. 26 flavors of goodness., 1118057=You can go hiking, ice skating indoors or outdoors in the winter, skiing (there is a fantastic ski resort in Logan Canyon about 45 minutes from campus), showshoeing, sledding, go to a show at the Ellen Eccles Theater, thrift shop, volunteer at numerous charitable organizations, attend free events and activities at the Logan Tabernacle (a community church/fine arts events center), shop at local businesses including antique book stores, organic markets, global trade gift shops, fashion boutiques, etc., you can take community classes, visit the local gardener's market from April to October, go yard-saleing, attend local religious services and events, get involved with the Deaf community, volunteer with our chapter of Special Olympics, spend time with the elderly, party at the White Owl (the only bar here that I know of), etc., 38363=Utah State University touts a friendly atmosphere, intimate campus, world-class research faculty and ready opportunities to work with them, and accessible professors. While the professors are readily available and glad to explain difficult courses during office hours, my professors explain concepts very poorly in class. Instruction seems to emphasize superficial examples and applications, and the deeper theory is rarely taught. My electrical engineering and statics lectures are 100% example, 0% theory, and the required textbooks only superficially explain things. The science professors are much better at explaining theory, but still emphasize sample problems instead of symbolic exploration. However, learning opportunities outside of class are much better. Though only a freshman, I\u2019ve been able to work with the university\u2019s Microgravity Research Team from day one, so I\u2019ve picked up a little heat transfer theory and have written ten pages of the team\u2019s proposal for a 2011 experiment. Almost any faculty member will set you up in a research project if you ask them, or at least tell you what to study so that you can contribute as soon as possible. They are happy to accept volunteer lab workers. The USU library is an excellent learning environment. It has quiet zones, group study rooms, several large open computer labs and conversational study areas, and an excellent collection. Besides, it boasts a flood of natural light in the daytime, so you don\u2019t feel locked up and confined inside. Overall, I\u2019d say USU is a pretty average learning environment. The facilities are good and the opportunities to learn outside of class are great, but these strengths are balanced by its remarkably poor lecturers., 917991=To become an Ultimate Aggie, one must run across the entire campus from the time first snow falls in November to February. The participant has to do so naked, evade campus police, and ride the huge metal bull statue. Oh yeah, and you have to be photographed for proof., 874751=They have movies held at the main building for student all through out the year which is nice because it gets cold in Logan. Sledding is an option through out the whole year. Utah State has The Howl every October and is way fun. Also the End of the Year Bash where they have bands and artist come perform. Can't forget about the football and basketball games that are a blast., 235153=the greek community has been steadily growing for the passed couple of years. fall of 2012 will welcome another fraternity and hopefully another sorority.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck I am getting every dollars worth that I have spent in going to Utah State. Am enjoying being here I can't even explain how much I love Utah State. It is so much fun and I am receiving such a great education. There are many activities to get the students involved. The USU basketball and football games are the best. It is amazing to see how much school spirit our school has when you go to these games and it is so much fun to be a part of it. The campus is beautiful. I love it because it is not too big, but also not to small either. Am learning a lot Every Professor I have had so far has just been unbelievable. They all are so passionate about the subject they are teaching and therefore it makes it much more interesting for the students.
