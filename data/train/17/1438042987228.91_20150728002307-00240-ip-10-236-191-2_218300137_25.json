Later, recognition arrived after impressive displays in the Indian T20 League for his home city, Delhi and Hyderabad later. A well-disguised googly and a precision leg-break are Mishra's honed stock deliveries., 33066=Dec 05 2012,, 34847=Nov 15 2012,, 33955=Nov 23 2012,, 25218=Following Kumble's retirement from Tests, Mishra became the first choice to partner Harbhajan whenever selectors opted for a two-pronged spin attack. Like his off-break partner, Mishra too is a handy tail-ender with the technical ability to become a good bowling all-rounder. Mishra has been provided with many opportunities to establish himself in both the shorter formats and the long ones, but unfortunately, he hasn't grabbed them at the big stages until the recent World T20 held in Bangladesh. Mishra managed to pick up 10 wickets in 6 matches in that tournament. He was even declared the man of the match in two consecutive matches for his brilliant bowling performance., 60971=\u00a9 Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2015.
