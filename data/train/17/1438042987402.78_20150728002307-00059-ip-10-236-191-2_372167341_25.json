    "textAfterTable": "Configuring SNMP Notifications To configure a router to send SNMP traps or informs, perform the tasks described in the following sections: Note Many snmp-server commands use the word traps in their command syntax. Unless there is an option within the command to specify either traps or informs, the keyword traps should be taken to mean traps, informs, or both. Use the snmp-server host command to specify whether you want SNMP notifications to be sent as traps or informs. To use informs, the SNMP manager (also known as the SNMP proxy manager) must be available and enabled on a device. Earlier, the SNMP manager was available only with Cisco IOS PLUS images. However, the SNMP manager is now available with all Cisco IOS releases that support SNMP. Use Cisco Feature Navigator for information about SNMP manager support for Cisco IOS releases.
