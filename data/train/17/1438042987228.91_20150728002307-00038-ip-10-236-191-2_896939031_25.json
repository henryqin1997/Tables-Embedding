Everyone on campus is motivated to succeed. The advisors are there to help you if you are not comfortable in a class. Also, there is tutoring available to each student free of charge. Also, if you need an essay looked over, or don't know how to start a paper you can visit the writing center and they are there to help you on your paper., 208662=Apply for scholarships within your major by Feb 1st!, 73584=Join greek life, or play intramural sports, even join a club. Last year 2011 the football team was the Division 2 National Champions, so tailgating is always fun!, 220481=Pittsburg, Kansas is the ideal college town. It has discounts galore for students, and many churches sponsor activities for those attending the school. PSU is also very safe, with a large police force which will be expanding in October., 238144=Dorm life is great. Most of the dorms have been renovated which makes the dorm life a better atmosphere. The beds are comfortable and the furniture that is in the room is nice. When choosing your dorm you really don't know what the difference is. Bowen, Tanner, and Trout are the dorms that have just been recently renovated. These dorms are known to be the quiet dorms. Also, they are closer to the football field and a father from the dining hall. Which doesn't sound bad, but when it is winter time it feels too cold to walk across campus to go and eat. Dellinger and Nation hall are the dorms that are closer to everything they are more of the louder dorms. Most of the basketball and football players live in these dorms. Dellinger is the nicer dorms they also have been recently renovated. Nation has not been renovated but will in the summer of 2014. The pros of living in nation is there are a lot of people, you are closer to classes and the dinning hall. The cons are they are louder dorms especially on the weekends. But overall the dorm life is great., 90920=Yell like Hell is held every year sometime in sept./oct. which involves a bunch of student organizations getting together and having a dance contest in front of the entire student body., 245858=The student-faculty ratio at Pittsburg State University is 19:1, and the school has 51.4 percent of its classes with fewer than 20 students. The most popular majors at Pittsburg State University include: Elementary Education and Teaching; Registered Nursing/Registered Nurse; Business/Commerce, General; Construction Management; and Psychology, General.

My major is Biology/Pre-Physical Therapy emphasis. My core classes that go towards my major are pretty challenging and filled with new topics. As challenging as they may be, the instructors are very willing to help with any problems one is experiencing.

From what I have noticed over the time I've been here is that most students are either accounting, education, construction management, automotive, or technology majors and they all seem to love their program.
