If the transmission speed is changed to 10 or 100, the duplex mode stays at half duplex. You must configure the correct duplex mode when the transmission speed is changed to 10 or 100 from 1000., 257461=1000 Mbps and full duplex (Gigabit Ethernet interfaces only), 170681=This command was modified to support automatic configuration of Cisco HWIC-4SHDSL and HWIC-2SHDSL running on the Cisco 1841 router and the Cisco 2800 and 3800 series access routers., 185972=This command was introduced on Cisco 2600 series and Cisco 3700 series routers., 260546=speed 1000, 253627=1000 Mbps and full duplex, 150014=The ds0-group command automatically creates a logical voice port that is numbered as follows on Cisco 2600 and Cisco 3600 series routers: slot/port:ds0-group-no. Although only one voice port is created for each group, applicable calls are routed to any channel in the group., 261444=Forces a speed of 1000-Mbps and the full-duplex operation, and disables autonegotiation on the interface (Gigabit Ethernet only)., 207748=1579 kbps, 236282=For the 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet Shared Port Adapter (SPA) and the 2-port 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet SPA on the Cisco 7304 router, autonegotiation is enabled. The command is set to auto., 220241=This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(11)YT and implemented on the following platforms for E3 and T3 controllers: Cisco 2650XM, Cisco 2651XM, Cisco 2691, Cisco 3660 series, Cisco 3725, and Cisco 3745 routers., 170282=This command was introduced for the Cisco HWIC-4SHDSL and HWIC-2SHDSL running on the Cisco 1841 router and the Cisco 2800 and 3800 series access routers., 206154=1000-34,010 kbps for E3, 326739=dot1q vlan-id [native]--Enables IEEE 802.1q encapsulation of traffic on a specified subinterface in VLANs. The vlan-id argument is a virtual LAN identifier. The valid range is from 1 to 1000.

Specify mode 4 to connect a T3 controller to a Verilink HDM 2182., 256151=Autonegotiates the speed. The interface advertises the capability for duplex mode for Fast Ethernet interfaces at a speed of 10-Mbps and 100-Mbps, and Gigabit interfaces at 10-Mbps, 100-Mbps, and 1000-Mbps., 260755=Forces a speed of 1000-Mbps and the half-duplex operation, and disables autonegotiation on the interface (Gigabit Ethernet only)., 200611=This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(11)YT and implemented on the following platforms: Cisco 2650XM, Cisco 2651XM, Cisco 2691, Cisco 3660 series, Cisco 3725, and Cisco 3745 routers., 188243=This command was implemented on Cisco 1800 series routers., 338043=IP Control Protocol (IPCP) is the part of PPP that brings up and configures IP links. After devices at both ends of a connection communicate and bring up PPP, they bring up the control protocol for each network protocol that they intend to run over the PPP link such as IP or IPX. If you have problems passing IP packets and the showinterface command shows that line is up, usethenegotiations command to see if and where the negotiations are failing. You might have different versions of software running, or different versions of PPP, in which case you might need to upgrade your software or turn off PPP option negotiations. All IPCP options as listed in RFC 1332, PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) , are supported on asynchronous lines. Only Option 2, TCP/IP header compression, is supported on synchronous interfaces.}",
