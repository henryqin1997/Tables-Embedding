    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70497=The action came early, but the suspense lasted all night long as the Potomac Nationals edged the Winston-Salem Dash 2-1 to win the 2010 Carolina League Championship., 72903=And for a few, there\u2019s the hope of more\u2026 heading to Harrisburg next season, and perhaps Syracuse the year after. But for some, this is the pinnacle of their professional baseball career, if not the end of it in affiliated baseball. As they did in 2008, some will snort and sniff about the advanced age of this team and dismiss their success. And those folks\u2026 well, you can just kiss my ass because damn, it was fun to watch., 72195=Frias would pitch five innings total, allowing the lone, unearned Winston-Salem run, on four hits and no walks, while striking out four. Joe Testa would follow him with a 2\u2154 innings of hitless and scoreless relief, walking one and striking out two. Zach Dials would follow for a four-out save, finishing the 2010 postseason with his second save and a 1.29 ERA., 18023=There are some parallels to the 2010 season and the 2011 season for the Potomac Nationals. Both teams started slowly\u2026VERY slowly, getting into offensive funks that saw both teams get shut out seven times. The 2010 edition finished the first half at 31-39, ten games behind Frederick; the \u201911 guys were 29-40 and twelve games behind the Keys at the break., 18394=Given that the core of the team was the 2010 Hagerstown Suns that faded fast in the second half, it was natural to think that a second-half rally was unlikely, particularly since it seemed rather unlikely that much come in the way of reinforcements. The whispers that Bryce Harper would skip the level turned out to be true, but what the team really needed at that point was pitching., 46273=The half system one of the best things ever conceived for minor-league baseball. It\u2019s an acknowledgment that player movement during the season affects the standings and helps generate interest in the second half. And it\u2019s what helped make the 2010 Potomac Nationals\u2019 pennant run possible., 18876=Oddly enough, both the hitting and the pitching did improve in the second half with basically just one starter (Solis) and one reliever (Holland) added to the mix. But while 2010 was largely the hitting getting much better down the stretch, the story of the 2011 second half was the stabilizing of the pitching. Essentially, it went from league worst (5.01 team ERA on June 1st) to slightly higher than league average (3.79 vs. 3.77) the rest of the way., 20938=That 215 steals led the league by 63 and was the most by the team in its affiliation with Washington and the most in the league since the 2008 Wilmington Blue Rocks. They were only caught 66 times, which works out to an efficiency rate of 76.5 percent. Yes, Eury Perez and Jeff Kobernus accounted for the bulk of it (88 steals combined) but even big men such as Souza (25) and Destin Hood (21) stole 20+ bases. The thievery helped offset the team\u2019s lack of doubles, but otherwise, this squad was mostly right around league averages. Not bad when you consider the position players were the second-youngest in the league., 25273=Demny, as aforementioned, improved over the course of the season but take a look at the ERAs by month: April \u2013 2.08, May \u2013 6.93, June \u2013 2.55, July \u2013 8.42, Aug/Sep \u2013 2.72. He\u2019s young (22 in August), throws hard (~93-95), and durable (100+ IP the past three seasons). Clearly, he made his adjustments and the league adjusted back, but you have to like that he was able to rebound not once but twice from rough patches of pitching., 24541=How\u2019s that for a segue? Just to expand upon what I wrote earlier, Olbrychowski was terrible as a reliever but found his groove as a starter (5.63 vs. 3.71 ERA) and the reverse was true for Frias (1.67 vs. 5.06). Bronson was actually better as a reliever when you look at the season as a whole, but unlike Olbrychowski and Frias, kept bouncing between roles (and levels) until he was given a spot in the rotation in mid-August and turned in quality starts in two of his four starts down the stretch., 19963=So let\u2019s take a look at how the 2011 edition stacked up against the rest of Carolina League\u2026 HITTING PITCHING Having watched these guys day in and day out, I was bit surprised to see that the team finished third in walks drawn \u2014 in my mind, there were only a handful of players that seemed willing to take the walk, and too many that weren\u2019t. But those that did walk, walked a lot (Francisco Soriano and Steve Souza were 2nd and 3rd in walk rate for players with 200+ PA in the Carolina League)., 22504=Now, in our little dance, we take a look at the Top 12\u2019s for the batters and pitchers in terms of PAs and IPs. Full statistics for the team can be found here. (* 2009 Draft Pick, ** DSL Graduate). I chose to highlight the \u201909 picks and DSL grads to illustrate the counterpoint to drafting \u2019em young: It takes time. In this subset, there are four \u201908 picks (Hood, Higley, Lozada, and Ramirez) and fifth that was traded for (Dykstra). Only one 2010 position-player draft pick saw playing time, and that was four games before his shoulder went out (Rick Hague) \u2014 two, if you want to count Zach Walters., 23447=What I personally like about High-A is that it\u2019s the true litmus test for a prospect. I\u2019ve seen varying percentages that break down once a prospect plays at level X, his chances of ever playing in MLB are now Y, but almost all of them jump from single digits to double digits when it comes to High-A vs. AA. Anecdotally, I can tell you that this where many players stall: The bridge over the Susquehannah in Harrisburg may as well be the bridge over the Rhine in Arnhem, so to speak. Seems like every April I fill in the lineups and think to myself \u201cThis guy is still here?\u201d \u2014 and the thought occurs on both sides of the scorebook., 47140=But a funny thing happened in that game. Potomac\u2019s first baseman doubled in the lone run, his first game back after being benched in the second game of the doubleheader in Salem. The next afternoon, he homered. The night after that, he hit a grand slam and doubled twice. You know the rest of that story, but the hitting became contagious. Bill Rhinehart hit .281 in July after a .226 June. Michael Burgess went from .183 in June to .286. Sean Rooney, as part of the ripple effect of the Matt Capps trade that reassigned catchers from A+ to AAA, dropped down from Harrisburg, where he had been struggling as a backup, and picked up where he left off in \u201909 and hit .308 in July., 19348=Coupled with an improved offense (4.00 R/G before July 1, 4.44 after), the P-Nats turned in a 39-31 second half that became good enough to win second-half Northern Division title when the Keys lost the last three regular-season games (and eight of the last ten). Thanks to league bylaws, Frederick\u2019s 39-31 mark down the stretch still earned them the home-field advantage in the first round of the Mills Cup playoffs. That turned out to be the difference as the Keys beat the P-Nats 3-2 for the fifth game and 3-2 for the series to send Potomac packing and end any hopes of defending the 2010 title.}",
