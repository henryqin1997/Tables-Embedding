            "There are so many activities to do on campus sometimes you will not have enough time during the semester to do everything you want. Whether it is concerts on campus, or a sports event the school is always doing its best to make sure you as the student enjoy your whole experience during college. Look online or at main campus buildings for fliers that will advertise everything that is going on campus that week or for the upcoming weeks.",
            "Have a side job because when you come to college you learn to be very grateful for all your parents have done and continue to do for you during your life. I learned how much my parents did for me which made me want to get a job very bad to earn my own money to spend on food or whatever I needed.",
            "Personally, I did not dorm my freshman year because I got an apartment with my brother close to campus. It saved me lots of money which of course is crucial, but living in the dorms you will meet a lot more students compared to living off campus or close to campus. This is simply because you are surrounded by a lot more people and these peers tend to be a similar age which then helps you meet more people.",
            "As previously stated, it is critical to come into college mentally prepared. During the last semester of high school most students do not try or care because they think these grades cant affect them. However this is a very common misconception. Personally, I overlooked trying during my senior year and did not come as mentally prepared for freshman year as I hoped. If I had come with my mind ready to learn I feel my academics could have been even stronger. However, everyone is going to be nervous so do not let nerves or stress interfere with your academics.",
            "Come in mentally prepared for college! Having nerves is going to be normal but you have to remember you are not the only one starting a new school year at a new place. All the students you will be around most likely are just as nervous as you are. After just completing my freshman year I remember coming to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee very nervous, and I also did not think I would make friends. Of course, I was wrong, and when I started talking to my new friends I asked them how they felt coming in to the school year. Most people replied they were scared or a little nervous which made me realize everyone around you is nervous also. Don't be shy, go approach some kids hanging outside and start talking to them and you will be happy you did not wait for friends to come to you.",
            "The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is a very diverse school with a diverse group of students who all have the same mission, to receive some sort of college degree. The professors have a similar mission which is to help us students succeed in getting a college degree. All of the students here are attempting to start off fresh in their studies, and begin to to build a positive beginning for the career they choose."

Oriental Theater, Miramar Theater for good music and movies., 229674=Looking for fun things to do in Milwaukee is hardly ever an issue. The Miramar on Oakland ave is a great venue for bands and electronic music Wednesday - Saturday of most every week (the only downside about the venue being a small cover charge). For those who are 21 or older, there are many bars and clubs surrounding the area to have fun, dance, and meet new and interesting people. During the warmer months bike riding, rollerblading, running, or playing volleyball is quite popular around the beaches on Lincoln Memorial Drive., 20213=Apply for as many scholarships as possible for school. Whether it is $100, or $1000, every little bit helps. Also, be sure to get your information and everything sent in by the deadlines so that you are not feeling like you are behind everyone else., 40126=I would suggest that anyone looking to pursue a dance degree should take dance classes from a local studio for a few years before attending the required audition. It was very obvious that the professors conducting the audition were looking for prospective students with previous dance training. Scholarships were awarded at the first three auditions held in October, February, and April. The last audition was held in June and students were still admitted to the program but scholarship money had already been used up., 761151=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 348388=Every October there is a Zombie Apocalypse where there are students dressed up as zombies, and you must cross the campus without being bitten., 163393=We have so many clubs and activities that I wouldn't even be able to count! If you can think of something we most likely have it! I, on the other hand, found an organization that we did not have, Autism Speaks. Once I found out we did not have an organization here, I started looking into starting it. I am now currently getting the chapter started for the Fall 2012 semester!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Gabrielle from Franksville, WI 09/10/2011 Reviewer is A current student here. 13 out of 13 people found this review useful. 2 of 178 Categories Comments Great for these types of students This college is great if you are unsure of what you want to major in. They offer an Ed Psych course that runs once a week and it's purpose is to help you select a major. It's great for someone who likes the city and isn't freaked out by crowds of people. It's also decent for commuters. Tips for prospective students -Do not put off orientation until the last minute. It's when you schedule your classes and you do not want to get stuck with the last picks. -Always rent your course books when you have the option. -Don't get caught up in the fun. Professors don't care if you don't do your homework, but it seriously hurts your grade. You need at least a C to pass a class here, so don't slack off. -Show up to class. Seriously, you will be so lost if you don't. This isn't high school where you get the homework",
