See the usage documenatation for a full list, or the definitions in the initialization file \"gs_statd.ps\".  Ghostscript can do many things other than print or view PostScript and PDF files. For example, if you want to know the bounding box of a PostScript (or EPS) file, Ghostscript provides a special \"device\" that just prints out this information.  For example, using one of the example files distributed with Ghostscript,     \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-sPAPERSIZE=legal      or   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-sPAPERSIZE=a4       for instance     \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-sPAPERSIZE=<paper_size>       In this case you must also use the -q switch, to prevent Ghostscript from writing messages to standard output.  To select a specific paper size, use the command line switch     \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-sOutputFile=%stdout%      or   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-sOutputFile=-       Note that the \u0092%\u0092 characters need to be doubled on MS Windows to avoid mangling by the command interpreter.
