Subsequently, the pigment moves toward the inside of the nozzle because the pigment has a better affinity for the ink present therein. WO94-03546 only describes that by using such an ink, the clogging problem can be solved. Namely, the paled image problem is not discussed therein., 268186=[0298] This document claims priority and contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-083297, filed on Mar. 22, 2001, incorporated herein by reference., 127948=[0210] The color difference in FIG. 13 is obtained based on the CIE 1976 Lab* color system. As the light source, any one of the light sources described in the color system can be used. By using such a printing method, the color difference of the printed images can be controlled so as to be not greater than 5, and thereby the resultant print images have an improved sharpness. The image quality by which printed images are evaluated is not limited to the color difference and may be the image density, grades of images which are determined by visual observation, or the like quality., 43916=[0024] JOP 2000-26779 discloses a pigment ink having a specific storage modulus and zeta potential. It discloses a pigment ink having good preservation property, however, it does not describe measures against the paled image problem and poor periodic discharge stability. When the present inventors reproduce the ink disclosed therein to evaluate the ink with respect to the paled image problem and periodic discharge stability, the ink has a poor periodic discharge stability, i.e., the ink has a drawback in that the ink in a nozzle from which ink drops are not discharged for a while is discharged in an undesired direction (an undesired discharge problem)., 42880=[0023] JOP 10-279869 discloses that by using an ink having a property such that phase separation occurs at a meniscus portion of the ink in a nozzle, reliability of the inkjet apparatus can be improved. JOP 11-91096 discloses that by using such an ink and in addition by disposing of the paled ink in a nozzle in a proper amount before recording images, formation of undesired images can be prevented. However, when disposing of the paled ink, the carriage having a recording head has to be moved to a non-image forming position under which a receiving material is not present. Therefore this technique is not suitable for high speed recording. In particular, when nozzles having a small diameter are used, the ink therein is very rapidly paled. Therefore, the ink disposing operation (hereinafter sometimes referred to as an idle-discharging operation) has to be frequently performed for each nozzle which suspends to discharge the ink for a while. Therefore the technique is not practical., 69004=[0084] Specific examples of the color pigments include C.I.
