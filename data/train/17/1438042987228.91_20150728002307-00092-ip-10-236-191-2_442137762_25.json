            "PANNING A NATIVE DISPLAY ON A MOBILE COMPUTING DEVICE TO A WINDOW, INTERPRETING A GESTURE-BASED INSTRUCTION TO SCROLL CONTENTS OF THE WINDOW, AND WRAPPING TEXT ON THE WINDOW - A method and system for rendering a window from an extended virtual screen on a native display of a mobile computing device is described. The system includes a server that detects a server, a first window associated with an application executing on the server, the server outputting the application to an extended virtual screen; identifies coordinates associated with a position of the first window on the extended virtual screen; and transmits the coordinates of the first window to a mobile computing device to display the first window on a native display of the mobile computing device. The system also includes a mobile computing device that receives a gesture-based instruction on the native display; evaluates contents of a second window at a location where the gesture-based instruction is received; scrolls the contents of the second window if the contents include a scrollbar; and pans the contents of the second window if the contents exclude a scrollbar.",
            "Interacting with Remote Applications Displayed Within a Virtual Desktop of a Tablet Computing Device - Virtual desktops generated by a virtual desktop application locally executing on a tablet computing device, can further display remote applications. The tablet computing device executes an operating system that does not contemplate a mouse pointer and that displays a native desktop. In many instances, the virtual desktop is displayed on the tablet computing device such that the virtual desktop appears to be the native desktop. The virtual desktops therefore include a mouse pointer which can be used to interact with the remote applications. The remote applications generate graphical application output when they execute on a remote server. The graphical application output is transmitted to the tablet computing device and displayed in an application output window displayed within the virtual desktop. Using a virtual trackpad or other virtual input device, a user can interact with the remote applications via the application output displayed on the virtual desktop.",
            "Interpreting a Gesture-Based Instruction to Selectively Display A Frame of an Application User Interface on a Mobile Computing Device - In general overview, the present disclosure is directed to a system and method for selectively displaying a frame of an application user interface on a mobile computing device. A user interface analyzer on a mobile computing device analyzes a user interface for an application executing on a remote server. The user interface analyzer identifies frames in the user interface, the positions of the frames, relationships between frames, and horizontal and vertical panning offsets to move between adjacent frames. The mobile computing device receives a user input requesting the display of an adjacent frame. Based on the information the user interface analyzer obtained, the mobile computing device displays an adjacent frame of the user interface.",
            "Integrating Native User Interface Components on a Mobile Device - By enabling mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, to leverage native user interface components, the methods and systems described herein provide users a more seamless experience, wherein the user can potentially be oblivious to the fact that the application is not executing locally on the mobile device. In some embodiments, a user interface is provided which the user uses to trigger the display of a native user interface component. In some embodiments, the systems and methods described herein auto-adjust the pan and zoom settings on the mobile device to ensure that remote windows are presented in a manner that makes it easier for the user to interact with the device. The systems and methods described herein permit the user to switch to the new window in focus or a visual cue may be displayed to indicate that a window has been created somewhere on the remote desktop.",
            "INTERPRETING A GESTURE-BASED INSTRUCTION TO SELECTIVELY DISPLAY A FRAME OF AN APPLICATION USER INTERFACE ON A MOBILE COMPUTING DEVICE - In general overview, the present disclosure is directed to a system and method for selectively displaying a frame of an application user interface on a mobile computing device.
