            "There is almost always something that is happening on campus. You will most likely find a club that is something you enjoy. I am a member of the Spanish Club and it is a good time.",
            "You get an great education with fantastic professors for a low price.",
            "There are many things to do for fun. I just spend most of my time between my classes hanging out with friends.",
            "I am a vegan and there are not many options for food, at least not in the Lions Den. I have not been to the dining hall though. There are drinks that are reasonably priced.",
            "I do not live in the dorms.",
            "Most of your professors will help you outside of class if you ask for it. Some courses are challenging but as long as you show up for class everyday and pay attention you should be fine.",
            "The campus is small and therefore easy to get around. However, you do not want to take classes back to back at opposite ends of campus; you will always end up late.",
            "Most of the professors are amazing and willing to help you outside of class. It is not overly expensive. It has amazing programs."

It's got the Boomtown Days festival in June, and nearby Carthage has it's Maple Leaf Festival in October, both of which are awesome to attend.

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students MSSU isn't exactly tough, but it's best not to slack off either. Go to class, study however much you need to and you'll be fine. Bang for the buck MSSU is definitely a bargain compared to others in the state. Some classes are not amazing, but for the real academics one can be pretty confident in landing a competent teacher. Am enjoying being here I can't say MSSU was my first choice and I am planning on transferring. However, it has been nice staying home for an extra year. So far, my teachers have been pleasant and willing to help and the overall atmosphere is comfortable. Am learning a lot Being a freshman, some of my classes so far have been common sense type classes (e.g. Oral Communication and the freshman orientation class), but classes that had some real substance (e.g. Sociology, Newswriting, American Literature) were great classes and I did feel like I was learning.
