    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{121641=A great time of year in Clarion is during A.L.F. or Autumn Leaf Festival. In October all the leaves change in Clarion and a week long festival is held in town. Vendors and rides sweep through, and the town becomes the mecca of activity. There is a Crafter's day, where the main street is shut down, and tons of hand-made crafts, are put on display, and also a parade leading to the stadium for our homecoming football game., 21816=Keep yourself in a good mood and surround yourself with things that you enjoy. There are so many options of things to participate in, so many people to become friends with, and so much down time to study and keep your grades up. Also, check the weather before you go home for the weekend, you never know what you'll come back to; there was a snow storm in October and it is currently over 70 degrees in mid-March., 339362=Clarion has a student-run University Activities Board (UAB) that plans events once a week. All of these events are 100% free to students and often end with participants leaving with free goods. There is also a free movie screening at 11:00 PM of saturdays at the Hart Chapel. Other than that, there is not a ton to do., 337542=Clarion University is a small campus located in the middle of Western Pennsylvania. The University makes effort to involve and attend to students in the same institutional manner as any other University; University organizations, events, scholarships, and alumni association. Yet, to reiterate it is a very, very small campus with, currently as of 2013-2014, as shrinking student body., 4018=-Having a car on campus is a lot easier than taking the bus! -Get flex points with your meal plans. They really come in handy and the food at the Gemmell Student Complex [where you can use flex points to pay] is a lot better than it is as Eagle Commons. -Get snow boots early, because it can snow as early as October. -Rent your books instead of buying them from the bookstore. Most of your textbooks you won't want to keep and you don't even get half of their original price when you try and sell them back., 47795=- Join an organization or club! You will make a lot of friends here. - In the fall, go to the football games. - Don't miss out on going down to the Autumn Leaf Festival (ALF) in October., 17689=Supposedly, a few old buildings on the campus are haunted. Every October they go on a paranormal ghost hunt. Also during October, Autumn Leaf Festival (ALF) allows us to be pardoned from class to participate in the festivities. Every Spring, at CampusFest, there is a big performer; such as Kesha or Mac Miller., 141661=Greek Life is a wonderful opportunity. I joined Delta Phi Epsilon in the spring 2011. I met over 40 loving, outgoing, and caring sisters. I also met many others that are in other sororities. I can guarantee that there is absolutely no hazing., 301292=During finals week in both the spring and winter semesters, the university offers a late night breakfast with professors. This activity includes a free breakfast meal to all students. There is music, dancing and is an all around great time. Also, in the Fall of 2013, Clarion University Alumni Association constructed an apple in the center of campus. The apple is used for students to promote on campus activities by being spray painted., 343533=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 217050=ALF week in October is made out to be such a big deal but its lame and a disappointment.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Clarion has many different clubs and intramural programs, so everyone can find something to do that they enjoy.

Joining clubs or programs is so easy at Clarion. -Anyone who isn't bothered by the snow/rain/hills. -Loving the outdoors really",
