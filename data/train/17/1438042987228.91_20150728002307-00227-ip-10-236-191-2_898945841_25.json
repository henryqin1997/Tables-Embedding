            "There are several that are run entirely by the student body. Not as strong as other schools because it is a small campus.",
            "A plethora of clubs from dance to public speaking.",
            "It is the most diverse university in the state.",
            "Every year there is quadstock, which is a on-campus concert. Every year in May, the school has four or five bands come play for an entire Saturday. Bands that have come in the past have been Nirvana, Dan Deacon, The Thermals, Del the Funkee Homosapien, and Mayor Hawthorne.",
            "All of the faculty have P.H.D.'s in the subject they are teaching. Smaller class sizes allow for a more personal relationship between faculty and students.",
            "How can I begin? Theaters, museums, concert halls. If you prefer the outdoors, there are tons of ski areas around, and SU provides trips to all of these Mtns. In addition, the school offers backpacking trips, kayaking, and bicycling. As for myself, I enjoy going to concerts, because Seattle is one of the best cities to see live music. Also, there are music and film festivals which are some of the largest in the country. It is hard to be bored in this city.",
            "Incredible food. Very fresh, with a good variety.",
            "If you live in a dorm with two or more people, you are in for a prison cell experience, but it can create a relationship that will last for years.",
            "High academic standards which can be a little frightening at first, but as long as you stay focused, you will excel.",
            "Learn to write good essays in high school, and read as much as you can.",
            "Very quaint, peaceful little campus in the heart of downtown Seattle. Diverse student body and an excellent faculty. Perfect school for those who want a city experience in their education."

We may be just the best team around, or because we don't have a NCAA football team. If you absolutely need to be at a school where they have football, then this may not be the right school for you unless you are okay with Intramural Flag Football. Other than that, Seattle U has many Division I Athletics and it currently holds a wonderful standing with both men and women's basketball team seeing as they are potential competitors that are seen to make it to the finals of the Western Athletic Conference title. Not to mention all the other wonderful Division I sports such as soccer, tennis, swimming, track, rowing, and more! For clubs, there are many clubs established which include the largest club on campus, Hawaii Club. If you're from Hawaii, then you definitely will feel welcomed here seeing as there are so many others that know where you come from and there is a club dedicated to keeping your culture alive. There are also other clubs such ones dealing with art, journalism, honor society, community service, and even music. SU has its own student-run radio station known as KSUB and you can listen from anywhere by just logging on the to their website! The school gives many students wonderful opportunities to do whatever it is that they love. You can even create your own club!, 47728=Come and take a tour of the campus! The campus is cozy, high-tech and well-situated within the beautiful city of Seattle. The classes are small, so the student to professor ratio is 1:13 and the classes within each major are interesting, challenging and well-worth the effort., 237602=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 107270=Every year there is quadstock, which is a on-campus concert.

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The low rating is only because I am in the Mateo Ricci program for humanities. My core, which substitutes the normal core, is philosophy based. Although some philosophy classes are challenging due to written assignments, they are all opinion based. As long as you can support your opinion in an intelligent manner, it isn't difficult. I am still taking some pre-req classes for the business school, which I really enjoy. These classes are challenging and support the business school's reputation as the best in the state. I would recommend all the professors I have had for all 4 of those classes.
