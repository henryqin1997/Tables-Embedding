            "The campus is a very safe place. Our security officers are awesome, but they can get a little crazy when asking for your ID.",
            "There is no greek life at Moody.",
            "There aren't tons of clubs around, but there are quite a few. There are clubs that are for minority groups, for events, for ministries, for music, etc.",
            "Moody is a great place for students wanting to learn more about the bible. It also is a fantastic place for music students. Moody has a high standing with many churches, companies, and other various employers.",
            "Every spring, there is a flag pole-ing. If a guy gets engaged, he gets duck taped to the pole and then gets a trial. He then gets shaving cream dumped all over him and his fiance has to come kiss him to get him released.",
            "Moody is tuition paid. Basically, you only have to pay for room and board and the random fees they slap you with. But its honestly a blessing.",
            "Moody is located in downtown Chicago. There is always something to do in Chicago! Free concerts, the bean, coffee, walmart runs, etc.",
            "The SDR is not a great place to eat. Health wise, you have to be extremely aware of what you eat. The atmosphere is loud and it is hard to find someone to sit with other than your bro-sis table.",
            "Dorm life is pretty active. We have tons of events like football, parties, get together's, and we always spend time with each other in the lounge.",
            "Moody has great profs. Some are easier than others. You just have to test the waters or hear what other students have to say.",
            "I highly recommend a day one experience. We have them a few times a semester!",
            "Moody is a fantastic place for learning, stretching, growing, and finding life long friends. It does have a few down falls like no drinking or dancing. But the perks of the school like being tuition paid is so worth it!"
