            "MANUFACTURING METHOD AND MANUFACTURING APPARATUS OF SHAPED ARTICLE - There is provided a method of manufacturing a shaped article having a plurality of lens sections arranged one-dimensionally or two-dimensionally and a substrate section connecting the lens sections, the lens sections and the substrate section being integrally made of a resin material. The resin material is cured between a transfer surface of a first mold, which is fit to one side surface of the shaped article, and a transfer surface of a second mold which is fit to an opposite side surface of the shaped article. A space between the transfer surface of the first mold and the transfer surface of the second mold is narrowed in accordance with contraction of the resin material caused by the curing, and the transfer surface of the first mold and the transfer surface of the second mold are kept in tight contact with the resin material.",
            "WAFER LEVEL LENS ARRAY AND MANUFACTURING METHOD THEREFOR - Provided is a wafer level lens array, in which a plurality of lens sections arranged one-dimensionally or two-dimensionally and a substrate section connecting the lens sections are integrally made of a resin material, capable of preventing the substrate section from being deformed. A wafer level lens array includes: a plurality of lens sections that are two-dimensionally arranged; a substrate section that connects the lens sections to each other; and a rib that is disposed on the substrate section and extends along the surface of the substrate section. The lens sections, the substrate section, and the rib are integrally made of a resin material."

The short-circuit member generates a short-circuit current according to the electromagnetic power and temperature-adjusts the heat generating tube. The heat generating tube adjusts the temperature of the pure water so that the temperature of the pure water flowing through the tube becomes a target temperature according to the temperature adjustment effect of the short-circuit current. In the apparatus, the flow-in port of the heat generating tube is grounded to earth to discharge electrification charges of a residual particle component related to the pure water, and fine the residual particle component. 20080223850 Published Description Patent application number Junji Nakao, Takatsuki-Shi JP //]]> BarDraw('2573989',['Patent applications by Junichi Nakao, Hyogo-Ken JP'],[[1,1,2,1]],['2007','2011','2013','2014'],0); // <script type=\"text/javascript\"> </div> <div id=\"legend2573989\" align=\"center\"></div> </div> <canvas id=\"bg2573989\" style=\"max-width: 500px; width: 100%;\"></canvas> <div> <p align=\"center\">Patent applications by Junichi Nakao, Hyogo-Ken JP</p> <div class=\"bar2573989\" style=\"max-width: 500px; width: 100%; float:left; \"> <div align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top:20px;\"> </table> </tbody> </tr> <td>09-25-2014</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20140284786\">SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE</a> - An aspect of the present embodiment, there is provided a semiconductor device, including an insulating substrate, at least one",
