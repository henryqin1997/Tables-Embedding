The scoring run capped a seven-play, 76-yard march., 80810=Tampa Bay tied the game at 14 just 1:18 later on Freeman's career-long 47-yard strike down the middle to Williams on a post pattern. The visitors needed only three plays, including a 31-yard catch and run by Williams on the first offering, to move 80 yards for the equalizer., 80564=The Cardinals regained the lead with 10:17 left in the half on a one-yard plunge by Wells to finish a four-play, 16-yard drive. The go-ahead score was set up by Sammie Stroughter's muffed punt that was recovered by Stephens- Howling., 80290=On the next Arizona series, Hall delivered just as he was being hit by blitzing safety Sean Jones, and Geno Hayes was able to pick off the fluttering pass and returned it 41 yards down the right side to even the score with 4:15 remaining in the opening quarter., 78666=After Freeman kept the ensuing drive going with a successful sneak on 4th-and- inches, he went up top to Arrelious Benn on the next play for 53 yards to get the ball to the Arizona one-yard line. Blount then powered in over the left side on the next play to put the Bucs back on top, 38-35, with 5:13 to play., 76603=Freeman has won eight of the 17 games NFL he has started, with four of his come-from-behind wins coming during the 2010 season., 78394=Arizona regained the lead with 9:41 remaining in the game on Fitzgerald's second score of the day that finished off a brief four-play, 48-yard set. He caught a screen pass to the right, slashed inside and dragged a defender into the end zone to make it 35-31.}",
