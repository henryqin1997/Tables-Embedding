            "The only major accidents and incidents we have on our campus is the cross walks, there have been a few students who have been hit in the cross walks. Whether you are walking or driving make sure you pay close attention when you get to them.",
            "I am not in a Greek organization, but as I look around campus not many of our Greek organizations are as involved on campus as the non Greek organizations, but they still make the Greek life look fun and it makes students want to be apart of it.",
            "There are a lot of clubs at Tech, you just have to stay on top of your emails so that you can know which clubs are looking for new members, but I'm sure there is at least one club that is perfect for each student",
            "This is a school that I think is good for all types of students, however, tech is more of an engineering school so engineering students might enjoy it a bit more.",
            "I wouldn't say we have any unusual traditions, but there is one game that students like to play every year which is humans vs zombies. I have never played but I see a lot of students running around campus playing and it looks very fun and interesting.",
            "Overall it's worth the money to go to the school. The only thing they can improve on are the dorms and I feel that there should be more activities on campus for the students. You will enjoy your time here though.",
            "Ruston may not be big but there is always something you can find to do whether it's going to Monroe to shop, going to a party, or simply hanging out with friends and having a movie night, there is always something you can think of. With the addition of our two new pools at the Intramural Sports Center you can also go swimming!!",
            "The food places are great. We have chic-fil-a, McAllister's, Burger Studio, Counter Culture, and more. To be honest, most students enjoy eating the cafeteria food as the food is really good. There are also healthy foods to choose from for those who like healthy eating.",
            "The dorms are okay they could be remodeled, but I enjoyed staying in Harper.They allow you to paint your room in the dorms, so you can decorate it to give it that home feeling. The apartments are decent, not all have washers and dryers inside but I have also enjoyed being in my apartment.",
            "It is crucial for you to stay on top of your school work. Even though you may have a class that isn't hard, there is still a lot of work and you can easily fall behind.",
            "1. Always check the dorms and on campus apartments, housing is very important. 2. Go into the Student Center and rub the Bulldog for good luck!!(: 3. Get to know a few people, this will be very helpful in the future.",
            "Nothing beats being a bulldog!! I have enjoyed being at Louisiana Tech and meeting new people. There are a lot of friendly people and many things that you can do to get involved on campus."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{100895=The food and dining on campus is pretty decent unless you are expecting gourmet food. I only eat in the cafeteria once a day, so I do not know how different the lunch and dinner menus are. However, there are a lot of options within the caf\u00c3\u00a9: there is always a pizza station, a salad bar, basic burger/fries, and a few \u00e2??entr\u00c3\u00a9e and sides\u00e2?? options. Outside of the caf\u00c3\u00a9, the most popular options are probably Chick-Fil-A and McAllister\u00e2??s. You will inevitably have to wait a long time for your food at McAllister\u00e2??s, but it is worth it. Other on-campus dining options include a Burger Studio, a Cajun place called Kickin\u00e2?? Cajun, a sushi/rice place, a sandwich joint, and a pasta/pizzeria. There\u00e2??s also a coffee place called Java City that I personally think is as good as Starbucks, but it has way less drinks to choose from. There are plenty of tables set up inside and outside that are perfect for eating, socializing, and enjoying the rare nice Louisiana weather. If you get tired of the on-campus options, Tech Drive, the main road leading to Tech from the interstate, has lots of cheap fast-food and snack places. The only complaint that comes to my mind is the pricey meal plan you are forced to buy every quarter if you live in the dorms or on-campus apartments. Some people can use it up, but you have to pay for it even if you do not use it all., 51445=the food in the cafe isn't the best in the world, but it's edible. we also have a food court with burger studios, cajun kitchen, salad garden, and tsunami sushi and noodles. other food venues at tech are chick fil a, mcalester's, bene's, bytes, and java city., 148591=Tech's food and dining is awesome we have been blessed with a great selection of food on our campus! I have yet to have a bad meal! We have Chik fil A, McAlister's Deli, a burger shop, sushi, sandwiches and salads, (my favorite) Cajun home cooking, and last but not least the cafeteria! The food does not disappoint on campus! I eat on campus everyday!, 212927=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 72475=Louisiana Tech recently completed remodeling and making additions to the Lambright Wellness and Fitness Center this past summer 2012. Among the stunning architectural additions to Lambright are a floor to ceiling rock wall, indoor and outdoor lap pool, frozen yogurt store, new fitness equipment, and much more. Not only can students enjoy all Lambright Rec and Fitness Center has to offer, students can also attend any and every athletic event free with their student id., 7111=I'm one of the few Nanosystems Engineering students here, a new major that was established in 2005. Louisiana Tech was the first college to offer a nanotechnology-based undergraduate degree., 181984=I feel totally safe on campus. Campus police is always patrolling and there are emergency phones around campus you can use incase of an emergency. there is an escort service that brings people to and from places after 6:00 p.m everyday so you wont have to walk at night or if you just simply don't feel like it., 61610=It is my opinion that school is school wherever you go, but it is the people who teach there and attend with you and what the school is about that will either draw you in or repel you. The wee town of Ruston is as cozy as a campfire in December and populated with an administration and people who do not crave the party atmosphere but instead have a blast with what is in front of them, hold onto their morals and standards, and do not wonder what they are labelled as. I will most definitely finish my college education at Lousiana Tech University and continue to advertise it as I do now as a school that teaches like all the others but is full of accepting, fun, and passionate people.}",

Tips for prospective students Don't let the older buildings and smaller town fool you, I did pass judgment on the school based on its looks when I first toured the campus. They are refurbishing and doing a lot of improvements around campus in the upcoming years, it's slowly but surely becoming more aesthetically pleasing. Bang for the buck",
