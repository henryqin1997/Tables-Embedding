            "Currently at Ball State University in their nursing program. Profs and instructors are excellent and very personable, have always helped with all issues I've come across. As for the nursing administration, not so much, they have been extremely rude to me and unhelpful despite their mistake in my scheduling resulting in the situation I'm in. BSU is a great school but the administration is spotty."

I didn't find out that I couldn't afford my first choice school until March (it was out of state, and I was waiting for the results of a scholarship contest sponsored by that school). When I found out I wasn't going there after all, I panicked because it was the only school I had visited. The first school on my what do I do now list was Ball State. I came here, and fell in love immediately!, 590771=This past summer, two of my friends, who were sophomores got a once in a lifetime opportunity to go to the 2012 London Olympics. They got to participate in the events and even meet and interview the USA Olympic basketball team. They are telecommunications majors and this opportunity was provided to them via the Telecommunications department of Ball State University., 1010887=There are tons of things the university puts on for you to have fun. Every Saturday, there is a Late Night program with different themes, and they always have free food. Each season has different events, and many associations put on different things to go to. There is also The Village right outside of Ball State. They have a coffee place and restaurant, but otherwise the street is under construction until 2015., 280283=Food was ranked among top dining halls in the country for 2010, every dorm with the exception of 2 have a place to eat within them. They have daily specials and the quality of the food is suitable to satisfy a students appetite, 1050105=I feel very safe on campus. There are little blue lights that indicate emergency buttons across campus. Still, I do not recommend walking alone at 3 o'clock in the morning.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck While the university is big-small in that it has large amounts of potential, while having a small campus feel, the prices can be quite expensive. Without financial aid, grants, and assistance, Ball State University can quickly became expensive. Thankfully, the programs in all areas from tuition aid to meal plans are well constructed and fit to your everyday life. Will enjoy being here The dorms are nice, there are lots of places to dine, and finding events, deals, and things to do are all easy tasks. I plan on enjoying both my time on campus learning as well as being involved with the many organizations that are available. Will learn a lot The staff and employees of the campus are both kind and knowledgeable of their areas. The presentations I have seen from professors during orientation demonstrates how varied they are and creative in their ways of instruction.
