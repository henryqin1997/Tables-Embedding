    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{88326=Background work for the proposed session: ActionAid International is organizing an international seminar on \"governance and disaster risk reduction\" in December 2004 in Bangladesh. The seminar is one of six seminars in a series titled \"Managing Risk: Exploring Interfaces Between Disasters and Development\" organized by Integrated Planning Against Risk [IPAR] and funded by Economic and Social Research Council[1] in the UK. The IPAR network is a transdisciplinary group of development practitioners, policy-makers and academics. It is hosted by five organizations; ActionAid International, Centre for Development Studies (University of Wales, Swansea), Benfield Hazard Research Centre (University College London), Wageningen University Social Scientists and INTRAC., 26662=At the end of IDNDR when the successor arrangement the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction was established, the Secretary General of the United Nations requested \"Governments to maintain and strengthen established national and multisectoral platforms for natural disaster reduction in order to achieve sustainable development goals and objectives, with the full utilization of scientific and technical means. \"He also stated in his report that: \"Given the success of national committees and focal points for the Decade in a large number of countries, the Secretary General strongly encourages all Governments to take the necessary measures to implement this appeal...\" (See Secretary-General's Report to the UNGA, 1999, A/54/497, para. 32), 58677=B/ Local and national risk reduction can be either supported or hindered by donor policy. Tearfund will discuss the obstacles that institutional donor organizations face when seeking to \u2018mainstream\u2019 risk reduction, and offer recommendations to address them. This will be based on Tearfund\u2019s consultation with 9 key donor organisations in 2003 including the EU, UN agencies, governments and financial institutions., 87901=The key speakers from Action Aid International will present a paper and show a documentary that will analyse the challenges, good practices and past experiences in the area of governance and risk reduction. The session proposed by ActionAid International will take forward the outcomes of the seminar we are hosting in December mentioned in the next section., 89570=ActionAid International has carried out a number of studies on the subject across many countries including Ethiopia[2], Malawi[3], India and Bangladesh. We published a paper together with the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) and University Collage London on the subject for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg in 2002 entitled \"Development at Risk\"[4]., 59178=C/ Tearfund and Cranfield University will present a new tool \u2013 a framework of indicators \u2013which enables donor organizations to measure and monitor their progress with mainstreaming risk reduction into relief and development processes. The indicators were developed in wide consultation with donor organizations and experts in 2004 and will be introduced at this session. The framework is designed to enable donor organizations to determine the \u2018level\u2019 of mainstreaming they have achieved, where level 1 represents \u2018zero progress\u2019 and level 4 represents \u2018fully mainstreamed\u2019. The Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) will comment on the framework\u2019s application for donor organizations, as well as SIDA\u2019s own approach to mainstreaming., 95740=Purpose and main discussion issues in the session: Given the problem mentioned above, the ActionAid International proposed session will discuss the barriers of risk reduction, potential solutions and suggest a policy direction for the WCDR negotiation process.

    "textBeforeTable": "Agenda: This session will discuss good practices and lessons learned with various aspects of establishing and strengthening National Systems for Disaster Reduction, such as: - Legal and regulatory frameworks - Policy and planning - Organizational structures - Resources and Capacities at local and national levels - Partnerships and cooperation at national and regional levels The session will commence with a brief session introduction, followed by short presentations of panelists from national governments, international and regional organizations as well as donor agencies on the topic of national systems for disaster risk management. Each contribution will aim at emphasizing a different aspect of the topic or present a different point of view. The panel presentations will be followed by an open discussion which will focus on identifying recommendations on how to improve the functioning of national systems for disaster risk management in the broader context of governance, how to make more effective the assistance provided, as well as the identification of issues which may require further discussion in the follow-up to the World Conference.
