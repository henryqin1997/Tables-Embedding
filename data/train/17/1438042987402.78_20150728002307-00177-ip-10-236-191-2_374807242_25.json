            "The EoMPLS over GRE feature allows you to tunnel Layer 2 traffic through a Layer 3 MPLS network. This feature also helps to create the GRE tunnel as hardware-based switched, and with high performance that encapsulates EoMPLS frames within the GRE tunnel. No new commands were introduced or modified by this feature.",
            "The GRE Tunnel IP Source and Destination VRF Membership feature allows you to configure the source and destination of a tunnel to belong to any VPN VRF table. The following command was introduced or modified: tunnel vrf.",
            "The GRE Tunnel Keepalive feature provides the capability of configuring keepalive packets to be sent over IP-encapsulated GRE tunnels. You can specify the rate at which keepalives will be sent and the number of times that a device will continue to send keepalive packets without a response before the interface becomes inactive. GRE keepalive packets may be sent from both sides of a tunnel or from just one side. The following command was introduced by this feature: keepalive (tunnel interfaces) .",
            "The following commands were modified by this feature: tunnel destination, tunnel mode, and tunnel source.",
            "This feature was introduced on Cisco ASR 1000 Aggregation Services Routers.",
            "High availability support was added to IP Tunnels. No new commands were introduced or modified by this feature.",
            "The Tunnel ToS feature allows you to configure the ToS and Time-to-Live (TTL) byte values in the encapsulating IP header of tunnel packets for an IP tunnel interface on a router. The Tunnel ToS feature is supported in Cisco Express Forwarding, fast switching, and process switching forwarding modes. The following commands were introduced or modified by this feature: show interfaces tunnel, tunnel tos, tunnel, and ttl."

    "textAfterTable": "Configuring an IPv4 GRE Tunnel Perform this task to configure a GRE tunnel. A tunnel interface is used to pass protocol traffic across a network that does not normally support the protocol. To build a tunnel, you must define a tunnel interface on each of the two routers, and the tunnel interfaces must reference each other. At each router, the tunnel interface must be configured with a Layer 3 address. The tunnel endpoints, tunnel source, and tunnel destination must be defined, and the type of tunnel must be selected. Optional steps can be performed to customize the tunnel. Remember to configure the router at each end of the tunnel. If only one side of a tunnel is configured, the tunnel interface may still come up and stay up (unless keepalive is configured), but packets going into the tunnel will be dropped. GRE Tunnel Keepalive What to Do Next GRE Tunnel Keepalive Keepalive packets can be configured to be sent over IP-encapsulated GRE tunnels. You can specify the rate at which keepalives are sent and the number of times that a device will continue to send keepalive packets without a response before the interface becomes inactive. GRE keepalive packets may be sent from both sides of a tunnel or from just one side.",
