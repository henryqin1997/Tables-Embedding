            "The absolute best deal I've ever seen on college classes. It's affordable, and close to town. How can you ask for more?",
            "Hang out on the tree deck! There's always a great group of people when it's nice out! Also, get involved! The drama program is pretty cool, and there are so many clubs to be a part of, it's easy to feel like you're a part of something.",
            "The salad bar is amazing, plus the healthy snacks are a nice change from normal cafeteria food.",
            "It's a challenge!",
            "Stay organized. With shorter classes, it's often easy to lose track of what's due, but if you can stay on top of your assignments, everything else is a piece of cake.",
            "Small classrooms give excellent opportunities to be able to talk to your professor, and not feel too intimidated to ask questions. A lovely clean campus with plenty of welcoming benches and decks to enjoy the outdoors gives you a refreshing break between classes. Faculty is incredible, they're willing to help each student rise to the occasion and give their best."

Tips for prospective students This is a very respectable two-year school and offers many programs where you can go straight into a job without transferring to a four-year school. If you wish to transfer to a four-year school there are three programs you can complete and many classes offered that will transfer. Bang for the buck Very affordable although the tuition did go up $10 since the cut backs from the government. Am enjoying being here It's a really student-friendly campus and provides many services to help you succeed. Am learning a lot",
