Rodgers actually fumbled and Allen came up with the recovery just outside the end zone, but McCarthy challenged the call. Replays showed Rodgers' knee was down in the end zone, which resulted in the two points., 48741=Aaron Rodgers, who replaced Favre as Green Bay's starting quarterback in 2008, threw for a career-best 384 yards. He went 26-of-37 with a pair of touchdowns and was picked off once., 53634=Rodgers was picked off by Antoine Winfield at the Minnesota 23, and Favre was at it again, going 5-for-5 on the ensuing drive, which gave the Vikings a 14-7 lead. It ended in familiar fashion with Favre pump-faking to the left before gunning the ball over the middle to Sidney Rice for a 14-yard scoring play with 4:59 left in the half., 48480=Adrian Peterson rushed 25 times for 55 yards and a touchdown for the Vikings (4-0), who have won their first four games to a season for the first time since 2003 when they captured their first six contests, but finished 9-7 and missed the playoffs., 49534=In 2008 Favre announced his retirement -- for the first time -- and his tumultuous divorce from the Packers came when the team wouldn't budge from naming Rodgers their starting QB. After playing one year for the Jets, Favre had a second brief retirement before finally joining Green Bay's NFC North nemesis., 53170=Two plays later, Favre threw across the field to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe in the end zone for a one-yard score with 3:20 remaining in the opening quarter. Favre completed all five of his passes during the march., 50479=Favre is set to return to Lambeau Field for a November 1 game., 48219=\"I had church today at 3 o'clock and I was sitting there and throwing all kinds of prayers out. I said 'man I'm losing it.' But I'm so thankful the way this game went and we were able to win it. The good lord answered my prayers I guess.\"}",
