It includes the following topics:, 69792=Microsoft Word 2000 Users:\u00a0After you add the background map and overlay the shape group, use the Grouping dialog to make the entire composition one group., 270372=To use the Oracle format mask or the Microsoft format mask, the numbers in the data source must be in a raw format, with no formatting applied (for example: 1000.00). If the number has been formatted for European countries (for example: 1.000,00) then the format does not work., 107098=http://myserver.domain:8888/CustomerReport/cstid=1234, 382648=For Excel 2007 output format, BI Publisher does not apply any formatting for number and date. BI Publisher saves the formatting mask and the actual value (date or number) into the XLSX output file. The formatting is handled by Microsoft Excel. For example:, 303141=Century. For example, 2002 returns 21; 2000 returns 20., 1127=1-Jan-2004, 208556=2000, 88895=Section 4.9.10, \"Repeat Row Headers After Page Break\", 359519=The pipe (|) is equal to the logical OR operator. In addition, XPath recognizes the logical OR and AND, as well as the equality operators: <=, <, >, >=, ==, and !=. For example, you can find all CDs released in 1985 or later using the following expression:, 281153=Digit. Each explicitly set 0 appears, if no other number occupies the position.

The value is divided by 1000 to set the stretch or shrink factor. For example, if the value is 2000, divide that by 1000 to get a factor of 2. The shape generates as twice its current height., 363585=For more information on XSL-FO see the W3C Website at http://www.w3.org/2002/08/XSLFOsummary.html, 315562=12/31/99 6:15 PM, 184523=1-Jan-2005, 383151=If the Microsoft Windows Region and Language of the client computer is set to French (France), then the numbers and dates in the same Excel 2007 output file are formatted in fr-FR locale., 165994=This field holds the code to highlight the cell red if the debit amount is greater than 1000., 70003=Microsoft Word 2002/3 Users:\u00a0These versions of Word have an option under Tools > Options, General tab to \"Automatically generate drawing canvas when inserting autoshapes\". Using this option removes the need to do the final grouping of the map and shapes. You can now generate a visually appealing output for the report as seen in Figure 4-27., 315815=Dec 31, 1999 6:15 PM, 287053=2005-01-01T09:30:10-07:00, 382935=If the Microsoft Windows Region and Language of the client computer is set to English (United States), then the numbers and dates are formatted in en-US locale in the Excel 2007 output file., 316070=Friday, December 31, 1999 6:15 PM, 2166=1000.00, 287092=The data after the \"T\" is optional, therefore the following date: 2005-01-01 can be formatted using either date formatting option., 316342=12/31/99 6:15 PM GMT, 300912=Excel2007 output (.xlsx) does not support the following format masks: E, EE, W, WW, X, XX. If you use these in an RTF template and generate Excel2007 output, the date with any of these formats will not be viewable. Some combinations of these format masks may result in an error when the Excel2007 (.xlsx) output is opened., 374462=BI Publisher supports native PowerPoint charts for certain chart types rendered in PowerPoint2007 output. When the chart is inserted as a native chart, you can modify it in PowerPoint. If the chart is not inserted as a native chart, then BI Publisher inserts a PNG image that cannot be updated., 129306=For information about using the Template Builder to insert conditional regions and conditional formatting, see Section 5.4.9, \"Inserting and Editing Conditional Regions\" and Section 5.4.10, \"Inserting Conditional Formatting.\", 282327=Determines the placement of the decimal separator.

Therefore, set this option to false only when a report includes the non-native chart types., 383370=Note also that Microsoft Excel 2007 output does not support some Oracle format masks.

When set to 'true', the currency symbol is displayed in the report based on the value for CurrencyCode. If you do not want the currency symbol to be displayed, then you can either enter 'false' or simply do not specify the parameter. At runtime, the Amount_Field is formatted according to the format you set up for the currency code in the report properties. To set the value dynamically, enter the tag name of the XML element that holds the ISO currency code. Note that an element that contains the currency code must be present in the data. CurrencyCode can either be set to a static value or it can be set dynamically. If the value is static for the report, then enter the ISO three-letter currency code in single-quotes, for example, 'USD'.
