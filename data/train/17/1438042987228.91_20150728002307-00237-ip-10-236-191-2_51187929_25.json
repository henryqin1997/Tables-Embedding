Palmer held out in 2011 before finally being dealt to Oakland midway through last season for a 2012 first-round pick and a 2013 conditional selection., 72176=Trailing 24-0 at the break, Sebastian Janikowski nailed a 55-yard field goal to cap Oakland's opening march of the second half and Palmer fired a 20-yard TD pass to Danarius Moore later in the third stanza to cut the deficit to 24-10., 71708=The two-time Pro Bowler was the No. 1 overall selection by the Bengals in 2003 after winning the Heisman at Southern Cal and helped the moribund franchise to a pair of division titles in 2005 and 2009., 72727=The miscue led to a 20-yard Mike Nugent field goal early in the fourth and Jermaine Gresham's TD catch with 3:39 left capped the scoring.}",
