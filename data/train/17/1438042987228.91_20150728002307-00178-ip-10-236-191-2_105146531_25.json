After a string of live theatrical productions, in 1938 the Mercury Theatre progressed into their best-known period as The Mercury Theatre on the Air, a radio series that included one of the most notable and infamous radio broadcasts of all time, The War of the Worlds, broadcast on October 30, 1938. The Mercury Theatre on the Air produced live radio dramas in 1938-1940 and again briefly in 1946., 595455=The story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of 1815\u20131838 (from just before the Hundred Days through to the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. An adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy and forgiveness, it tells of a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune and sets about getting revenge on the men who destroyed his life. However, his plans also have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, \"The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.\", 508283=\"Here\u2019s the different active kernel versions that I am maintaining at the moment: 3.2.y \u2013 this will be maintained until 3.3 comes out 3.1.y \u2013 there will be only one, maybe two, more releases of this tree 3.0.y \u2013 this is the new \"longterm\" kernel release, it will be maintained for 2 years at the minimum by me. 2.6.32.y \u2013 this is the previous \"longterm\" kernel release. It is approaching it\u2019s end-of-life, and I think I only have another month or so doing releases of this. After I am finished with it, it might be picked up by someone else, but I\u2019m not going to promise anything. All other longterm kernels are being maintained in various forms (usually quite sporadically, if at all), by other people, and I can not speak for their lifetime at all, that is up to those individuals.\" \u2013 Greg Kroah-Hartman There was also a bit of a dust up between Tim Gardner of Canonical and Greg Kroah-Hartman over maintenance of the 2.6.32 kernel once greg gives it up.

Answer = YES, 605966=This episode was originally posted on October 15th 2011 by Dan Lynch of Rathole Radio and linuxoutlaws fame., 573465=Nmaps author says CBS Interactive and CNET\u2019s Download.com are wrapping the open source application in a proprietary installer. In the past, they have never altered the application downloads they serve up, they have been changing that over the last six months. Gordon \u201cFyodor\u201d Lyon, lays out his issues in a posting to the Nmap Hackers mailing list. He claims the installer does thing like install the \u2018StartNow\u2019 toolbar\u201d, makes Bing the default search engine, and then sets the users home page to MSN. This is how a \u201ctrojan installer\u201d functions. If the installer is seperated from the download and sent to VirusTotal it shows that ten of the 42 scanners, they run it against, identify it as a trojan or adware installer. Also the Nmap trademark is displayed next to offers to install software, as if the Nmap organization supports these products. As Nmap is not under the plain GPL but under an enhanced version that specifically prohibits aggregation into a proprietary executable installer. Download.com initially claimed its scheme is simple for developers to opt-out of. The opt out is not automatic though. Download.com says \u201call opt-out requests are carefully reviewed on a case by case basis.\u201d Lyon is looking for a US copyright attorney and wants to get the word to the hundreds of users who use Download.com every week to download Nmap. CBS\u2019s Download.com site has been called out for this type of behaviour before. In August, ExtremeTech claimed similar behaviour with the media player VLC. According to an FAQ from CBS this installer software was rolled out in July. After the fecal matter hit the fan on this Download.COM back pedaled in a big way. In a statement, Sean Murphy, the Vice President and General Manager of Download.com said, \u201cThe bundling of this software was a mistake on our part and we apologize to the user and developer communities for the unrest it caused.\u201d Then adding that they had \u201creviewed all open source files in our catalog to ensure none are being bundled\u201d. Lyon posted an update, stating that Microsoft had been in contact with him and claimed they \u201cdidn\u2019t know they were sponsoring CNET to trojan open source software\u201d. Microsoft also stated that they had stopped the practice, which seems odd since they said that they were unaware that it was happening. So now the Download.com installer changed to install the \u201cBabylon toolbar\u201d which did different search engine redirection. CNET then later removed that and is now installing its own \u201ctechtracker\u201d tool for updating downloaded software. However they are also restoring the \u201cDirect download link\u201d which allows users to download files without having to download the \u201cdownload manager\u201d. Who knows if these changes will quell the controversey. The changes only affect open source software and the proprietary freeware and trial software on Download.com will still have the Download.com Installer packaging. A number of open source programs at Download.COM still had an installer wrapping them. There has been no general apology for bundling GPL software with closed source installers., 514267=The Raven 2 is a surgical robot with 7 degrees of freedom, compact electronics and two wing-like arms which end in tiny gripper claws designed to perform surgery on simulated patients.

We are reaching out to TWATech, BinRev Radio, Radio Freak America, Podfert, the Infonomicon Computer Club, and contributors to the first twelve months of HPR. Our discussion will be recorded via the LinuxBasix.com Mumble server (mumble.openspeak.cc , Port: 64747) and be released as HPR episode 1024 (Stankdawg's idea). Episode 1024 should fall on 5 July, but we would like to shoot for recording the panel about two weeks before hand. In case of technical or other unforeseen problems on the primary recording date, a two week lead would give us time to regroup and make a second attempt. The date and time will be set to make it convenient for the greatest number of people who are willing to participate to join in. Connections over Skype and SIP phone via Asterisk are possible, but it would be simplest for everyone to try to use the open source Mumble client. If you decide to join in (and we hope you will), please include the time zone of where you will be in mid June, especially if you are outside the continental United States. If there are dates, days of the week and/or times you would like me to avoid scheduling the panel (i.e., \"I will be gone June 19-21\", \"I could only do it on a weekend\", \"only after 8PM\", \"only before 10PM\") I would like to know that as well. You may contact the organizers at ep1k@HackerPublicRadio.org, 430366=From: David Whitman A friend from work got intersted in going to the LinuxFest and helped at the table - Much thanks to Brad Coffey. We got set up on time and were well received. We had a great run on our swag and ran out of the HPR pin buttons by closing on the first day and handed out quite a few informational cards.The little business cards were really a hit also. Lots of good conversation and exposure for HPR. There was a constant stream of people coming by. I have four interviews on my various recording devices and should be able to get about four to six more from the sign up sheet that was available on the table. With a bit of planning and a more formal interview 'track' (using an appointment schedule and a designated room or area) I am sure a well staffed HPR table could easily get 20 interviews at this fest. Of course I will be interested in seeing if any of the many we talked to produces and post their own show. There was interest. I sensed that many of the speakers would have loved the extra exposure. HPR is probably becoming the embedded reporters of Linux Fests. The unofficial count of attendees that I heard was at \"over 800\". The table kit is ready to be shipped to the next venue. My intent is to put together a vertical layout canvas that can easily be shipped and set up as a backdrop and utilize a series of those 20 by 30 photo posters available at Costco Photo. This however will have to wait until after my annual spring fling of shutdown work that begins on May 5 and takes up to 3 weeks to complete. I'll post a G+pic of the backdrop we used at this fest. Best swag for me - a Tux 2012 bumper sticker from Pogo Linux. Look for a scan of this on G+ in the near future. Thanks to the HPR community for the opportunity to represent the show. It was much fun. davidWHITMAN, 484165=Release Candidate: On Sun, 4 March 2012 02:57:31 UTC Greg Linus Torvalds announced the release of Kernel 3.3-rc6 Keep The ARM Architecture Open Fastest Growing Desktop Linux Up 64% In 9 Months Azure Goes Down!

Well so does Apple which is why they have appealled using a Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) defense.

It will be held on August 25 from 12pm EST until 12am EST August 26. This event will be streamed at The New Radiofor the entire event. It's going to be held over at Linux Basix, using their Mumble server. To find out the information for the Mumble server, please visit the Linuxbasixsite . We'll be able to have up to 30 people in the room at once, so come and join us in talking about accessibility and Free software. So far, joining the event we will be having Jono Bacon from Ubuntu, and Zack the Debian project leader. If you'd like to speak with either of them, please come and join us on August 25. The goal for this fundraiser is to have 1000 people become members of the ACF at $2 a month. We have 3 other levels of membership options if anyone is interested. This would be a great help to the foundation and really get us off of the ground to start bridging the gap between accessibility and technology. The reason we're focusing on the $2/month level is because it's only 50 cents a week and we think this is a goal most people could meet, even if living on a fixed income like so many people with disabilities. Since monthly membership is so low, we are really depending on MANY people to become members to make this difference. Granted $2 a month isn't much, but if we can get a large number of people thinking this way, it will add up quickly and help out the Accessible Computing Foundation in a great way.

You can choose to either boot into console or graphical mode, recommend the graphical mode even though it is GNOME 3. If your hardware will not support GNOME 3 you can opt to fall back on Classic GNOME. After bootup you will see the default live user enter the password nst2003 and let the desktop load. Once the desktop has fully loaded you can either take it for a test drive or jump right into the install.
