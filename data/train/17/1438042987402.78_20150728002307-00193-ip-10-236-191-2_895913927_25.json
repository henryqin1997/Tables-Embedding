            "Parkland has a wonderful Cafe'. I go there a lot when I get out of class, it's a great pick me up. I especially like the little sub sandwiches they have!",
            "The teachers are very friendly. On another hand they are also strict when it comes down to doing work. They want the work to be proficient and on time, but they will help you if you ask for it.",
            "For future students, I recommend that you do not slack your Freshman year. It is the hardest year and has the highest drop out rate. Stay focused on school and maybe work, and leave the partying for another time.",
            "Parkland College is a great college. It is one of the top Community Colleges in state of Illinois. I am proud to be a Parkland Cobra!"

Most students get financial aid and also scholarship. Students get a great education for a very chap price., 14299=There isn't any dorms since it is a community college, however, in the Fall of 2012, there will be Parkland apartments provided for Parkland students that have applied from different states or faraway cities/towns. It's cheap, efficient and a safe place to live at, and have great transportation (bus stops) to travel to Campus Town or to other parts of Champaign-Urbana., 76816=There are no dorms at Parkland College. It is a commuter campus, with several choices of apartments and town homes in the immediate area. A brand-new apartment complex will be completed for the Fall 2012 school year., 121153=This is a dysfunctional school. I have been planning to attend since April, it's now August. I had to drive 200 miles to take a compass exam, pay for it,and all of the other hoops and they cancelled the program 1 week before it started.}",

The college experience is only what you make of it, so enjoy it while you can! Bang for the buck While college is financially frustrating at any institution, Parkland helps in the sense that it's not quite so overwhelming and impossible for families to find a way to manage the payments. The required books and materials for classes can be pretty expensive.
