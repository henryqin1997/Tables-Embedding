To enable municipal advisors to temporarily satisfy this requirement, the Commission adopted an interim final temporary rule, Exchange Act Rule 15Ba2-6T, and form, Form MA-T, effective October 1, 2010. To enable municipal advisors to continue to register under the temporary registration regime until the applicable compliance date for permanent registration, the Commission is extending Rule 15Ba2-6T, in a separate release, to December 31, 2014. The Commission is today adopting new Rules 15Ba1-1 through 15Ba1-8, new Rule 15Bc4-1, and new Forms MA, MA-I, MA-W, and MA-NR under the Exchange Act. These rules and forms are designed to give effect to provisions of Title IX of the Dodd-Frank Act that, among other things, require the Commission to establish a registration regime for municipal advisors and impose certain record-keeping requirements on such advisors., 18784=The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d) is making technical amendments to update control numbers assigned to information collection requirements of the Commission by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980., 88850=Executive Order ... 11222, 9011=This document corrects an instruction for the authority to part 200 in a final rule published in the Federal Register of April 20, 2015 regarding the Amendments for Small and Additional Issues Exemptions under the Securities Act (Regulation A)., 88988=Reorganization ... 1950 Plan No. 10, 87613=124 Stat. 1376, 3876=This document corrects the designation of a paragraph in Item 6 of Part I to Form 1-A in a final rule published in the Federal Register of April 20, 2015, regarding the Amendments for Small and Additional Issues Exemptions under the Securities Act (Regulation A)., 52107=On August 6, 2010 and September 16, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) published documents in the Federal Register (75 FR 47449 and76 FR 57637, respectively) that each included an inaccurate amendatory instruction pertaining to an authority citation. The Commission is publishing this technical amendment to accurately reflect the authority citation in the Code of Federal Regulations., 14133=We are adopting amendments to Regulation A and other rules and forms to implement Section 401 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. Section 401 of the JOBS Act added Section 3(b)(2) to the Securities Act of 1933, which directs the Commission to adopt rules exempting from the registration requirements of the Securities Act offerings of up to $50 million of securities annually. The final rules include issuer eligibility requirements, content and filing requirements for offering statements, and ongoing reporting requirements for issuers in Regulation A offerings., 23013=The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) is amending its rules to delegate to the Chief Financial Officer the authority granted to the Commission by Section 21F(g)(4) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) to request that the Secretary of the Treasury invest the portion of the Commission's whistleblower reward fund that, in its discretion, is not required to meet the current needs of the fund, and determine the maturities for those investments suitable to the needs of the fund. These changes are intended to streamline the operation of the Commission by delegating to staff certain routine financial responsibilities., 47184=The Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) is rescinding rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) that established the Commission's program for supervising investment bank holding companies. The Commission is taking this action pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), which eliminated the applicable section effective July 21, 2011. The Commission also is rescinding certain exemptive provisions in its broker-dealer risk assessment rules and delegation of authority rules that pertain to the supervised investment bank holding company program rules that are being rescinded., 57315=We are making a technical amendment to Regulation D and conforming changes to certain other rules. Regulation D was last amended in Release No. 33-9287 (December 21, 2011), which was published in the Federal Register on December 29, 2011. Those amendments became effective on February 27, 2012. Due to a typographical error in that release, the Preliminary Notes to Regulation D were inadvertently deleted from Regulation D. We are restoring the deleted text as new Rule 500. The deleted text is not being restored as Preliminary Notes in order to comply with current Federal Register codification standards., 69265=\u00a7 1109 - Right to be heard, 88896=Executive Order ... 12356, 66272=The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) is amending its rules to conform them to amendments made to the Inspector General Act of 1978 that require the Commission's Inspector General to report to and be under the general supervision of the full Commission., 88942=Executive Order ... 12600, 71305=15 U.S. Code \u00a7 32, 33 - Repealed.
