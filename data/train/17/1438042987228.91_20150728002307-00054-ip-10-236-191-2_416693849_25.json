Well, it just so happens that, until a few years ago when it was changed, the mascot of WHS was Johnny Reb. We were the Westbury Rebels... hence, the flag. It is necessary to disclaim any connection of this flag to neo-nazis, skin-heads, the klan, white supremecists, certain fraternities and those like them! Those groups have adopted this flag and desecrated it by their acts. They have no right to use this flag - it is a flag of honor, designed by the Confederacy as a banner representing state's rights and sovereignty, and it is still revered by many Southerners. The South denies any relation to those hate groups who desecrate this flag and denies them the right to use the flags of the Confederacy for any purpose. The crimes committed by those groups under the stolen banner of the Confederacy only exacerbate the lies which link the seccesion of the southern states from the Union to slavery interests when, from a Southerner's view, the cause was state's rights. **I can no longer maintain this page!
