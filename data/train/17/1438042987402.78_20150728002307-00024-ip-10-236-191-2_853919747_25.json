High blood pressure left him bedridden for most of the 1946 season, unable to stand for long periods, and forced to ride in a trailer to conduct many Alabama practices.[33] After the 1946 season his ill health forced his resignation when he was only 48\u00a0years old, and Thomas later died in Tuscaloosa on May 10, 1954.[33] During his fifteen seasons as head coach at Alabama, Thomas won four SEC championships and compiled an overall record of 115 wins, 24 losses and seven ties (115\u201324\u20137) record, for an .812 winning percentage.[32], 12971=Over the course of the season, Frank Thomas was riddled with health issues that ultimately led to his resignation as head coach. In January 1947, Harold Drew was named as the 17th head coach of the Crimson Tide., 65643=Prior to the conclusion of the season, speculation began as to who would succeed Thomas as the head coach of the Crimson Tide. In early November, sources indicated that former Thomas player, and then head coach at Kentucky, Bear Bryant was to become the next head coach of the Crimson Tide.[34] On November 11, Bryant stated that he had not been in contact about the Alabama job and indicated his focus was on the Wildcats.[35] After an exhaustive search, on January 14, 1947, former Thomas assistant and then head coach at Ole Miss, Harold Drew was introduced as the new head coach of the Crimson Tide.[36], 9663=The 1946 Alabama Crimson Tide football team (variously \"Alabama\", \"UA\" or \"Bama\") represented the University of Alabama in the 1946 college football season. It was the Crimson Tide's 52nd overall and 13th season as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The team was led by head coach Frank Thomas, in his 15th year, and played their home games at Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Legion Field in Birmingham and at the Cramton Bowl in Montgomery. They finished with a record of seven wins and four losses (7\u20134 overall, 4\u20133 in the SEC)., 26117=To open the 1946 season, the Crimson Tide played the Furman Purple Hurricane, who fielded their first team since the 1942 season, on a Friday night at Legion Field.[3] Against the Purple Hurricane, Alabama won 26\u20137 before a crowd of 25,000 in Birmingham.[2][4] In the first quarter, Alabama took a 6\u20130 lead after Norwood Hodges intercepted a Skeeter Coyle pass and returned it 27-yards for a touchdown. On the kickoff that ensued, Charlie Truluck returned it 95-yards to give Furman a 7\u20136 lead.[2] The Crimson Tide responded with a pair of second-quarter touchdowns to take a 19\u20137 halftime lead. The first came on a 29-yard Harry Gilmer pass to Ted Cook and the second on a six-yard Johnny August run.[2] Alabama then scored their final points of the game in the third quarter on a 15-yard Gilmer run.[2] The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Furman to 2\u20130.[5], 37201=After they opened the season with three consecutive victories, Alabama was recognized with the No. 6 ranking in the first AP Poll for the 1946 season in the week that led to their game against the Southwestern Louisiana Institute.[11] Against the Bulldogs, that were led by former Tide great Johnny Cain, Alabama won their fourth game of the season with their 54\u20130 shutout at Denny Stadium.[4][10][12] Alabama took a 6\u20130 first-quarter lead after Lowell Tew scored on a 28-yard touchdown run.[10] They extended their lead 20\u20130 at halftime after Johnny August threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Bob Hood and Lionel W. Noonan scored on a three-yard run.[10]}",
