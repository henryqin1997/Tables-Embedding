The fine particle size waterwashed kaolin clays taken from the Tertiary layer in east Georgia have a typical oxide composition represented by 0.4-1.0% by weight of TiO2, 0.8-1.5% by weight of Fe2O3, 38.4-39.4% by weight of Al2O3, 44.8-45.9% by weight of SiO2, 0.02-0.42% by weight of Na2O, 0-0.19% by weight of K2O, and 0-0.03% by weight of CaO, with an ignition loss (at 1000\ufffd C.) of 13.4-14.0% by weight., 56142=Waterwashed delaminated kaolin clays taken from the Cretaceous layer in middle Georgia have a typical chemical oxide composition represented by 0.4-1.2% by weight of TiO2, 0.2-0.7% by weight of Fe2O3, 36.9-39.9% by weight of Al2O3, 44.8-45.8% by weight of SiO2, 0-0.38% by weight of Na2O, 0.01-0.21% by weight of K2O and 0-0.22% by weight of CaO, with an ignition loss (at 1000\ufffd C.) of 13.3-13.9% by weight., 54898=Airfloat kaolin clays taken from the South Carolina crudes have a typical chemical oxide composition represented by 1.0-2.0% by weight of TiO2, 1.0-2.2% by weight of Fe2O3, 37.3-39.3% by weight of Al2O3, 44.4-46.4% by weight of SiO2, 0-0.18% by weight of Na2o, 0.03-0.63% by weight of K2O, and 0-0.22% by weight of CaO, with an ignition loss (at 1000\ufffd C.) of 13.4-14.0% by weight., 187734=In comparing the performance properties of Examples 19 and 25, the above test data show the superior reinforcement provided by the silane-treated Clay AT of 1.0% treatment relative to a conventional sulfur functional treated clay like Nucap\u2122 290. Superior filler reinforcement is indicated by the higher tensile strength and moduli properties of Example 19. This superior performance is also reflected in the relative amounts of N-660 carbon black that can be replaced by these treated clays while maintaining a very high modulus value. For instance, when comparing the performance properties of Examples 20-24 with those of Examples 27-31, one will note that about 50% of the N-660 carbon black can be replaced with the 1% silane-treated Clay AT while still providing a high 300% modulus level of approximately 2300 psi whereas only about 30% replacement of N-660 is realized at that same modulus when using Nucap\u2122 290. The 1% silane-treated Clay AT also provides greater tensile and better tear properties as compared to the N-660 carbon black control (compare Examples 19 and 26). These examples all illustrate the high performance characteristics associated with the silane-treated clays of this invention., 62874=On the other hand, if the pH of a silane dispersion fluid wherein vinyl functional silanes are dispersed in water in the presence of surfactants is adjusted to be acidic, for example in the pH range of 3.0-5.0, or to be alkaline in the pH range of 7.5-10.0, then the silane emulsion can be stabilized. If the pH of the silane dispersion fluid is adjusted in this way, then the vinyl functional silane can be prevented from being lost by means of silanol self condensation before ever reacting with the kaolin clay. The pH of the silane dispersion fluid can be adjusted by adding alkaline or acidic substances such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or acetic acid., 61241=The silanes are high speed dispersed into water in the presence of surfactants to form a silane emulsion. In order to efficiently and uniformly disperse the silanes into the water, the fluid mixture containing silanes, surfactants and water should be agitated vigorously. A silane dispersion fluid wherein silanes have been pre-dispersed in surfactant-containing water should be prepared prior to mixing the silanes with the kaolin clay. The concentration of the silanes in the silane dispersion fluid should be 25-60% by weight. Additionally, the amount of surfactant used should be 0.5-10 parts by weight, more preferably 2.0-5.0 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the silane. It is preferable that the surfactants employed have HLB (hydrophilic/lipophilic balance) values of 8-18 and various non-ionic surfactants are especially preferable as the surfactants. The above-mentioned silane dispersion fluid is pH-adjusted depending upon the type of silane, prior to mixing with the kaolin clay., 25267=This application is a divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 09/185,641, filed Nov. 4, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,699 which is a divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 08/827,578, filed Mar. 28, 1997, and issued under U.S. Pat. No. 5,871,846, on Feb. 16, 1999., 62275=If the pH of a silane dispersion fluid wherein sulfur atom-containing mercaptosilanes, thiocyanatosilanes or disilyl tetrasulfanes are dispersed in water with a surfactant is adjusted to be alkaline, for example in the pH range of 7.5-10, then the sulfur functional silane emulsion can be stabilized. That is, if the pH of the silane dispersion fluid is alkaline in this way, then the sulfur functional silane can be prevented from being lost by means of silanol self condensation into silicone oligomers or polymers before reacting with the surface hydroxyls of the kaolin clay.}",
