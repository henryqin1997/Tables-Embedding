    "textBeforeTable": "</grainofsalt> I briefly got on my soapbox about what a poor decision it was by DCX not to produce the Gladiator, and his response was that the company wanted to build a customer base for the new Wrangler and Patriot before adding yet another vehicle to the lineup, but that we should expect to see a Jeep pickup in the next few years. While visiting the Jeep display at NAIAS last week, I had a conversation with the DCX rep at the desk (not the model demo'ing the vehicles). He stated that the Commander will be discontinued so that potential customers can be steered towards the Aspen. He also grudgingly acknowledged that the Compass did not meet Jeep's expectations and would likely not have a significant production life. (There wasn't even an accessible Compass on the display floor!) \u00a0Re: Clock Ticking on Commander?

Makes sense, I think the commander has taken away potential G/C sales. Its a great vehicle, the biggest complaint is lack of space. It would make sense to build a bigger commander with a crd option that would get reasonable fuel economy. I talked to a dcx product tester that had a crd commander and said they were getting 28MPG's!!
