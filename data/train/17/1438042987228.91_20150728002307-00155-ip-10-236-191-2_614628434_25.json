            "Description",
            "The ALS60 calibration and system performance is verified on a periodic basis using Woolpert's calibration range. The calibration range consists of a large building and runway. The edges of the building and control points along the runway have been located using conventional survey methods. Inertial measurement unit (IMU) misalignment angles and horizontal accuracy are calculated by comparing the position of the building edges between opposing flight lines. The scanner scale factor and vertical accuracy is calculated through comparison of LiDAR data against control points along the runway. Field calibration is performed on all flight lines to refine the IMU misalignment angles. IMU misalignment angles are calculated from the relative displacement of features within the overlap region of adjacent (and opposing) flight lines. The raw LiDAR data is reduced using the refined misalignment angles.",
            "Using Leica ALS60(LiDAR) system, 233 flight lines of high density data, at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 1 meter, were collected for the NRCS Tupelo, MS (approximately 3,697 square miles). Data Acquisition Height = 6,500 feet AGL - Aircraft Speed = 130 Knots. Multiple returns were recorded for each laser pulse along with an intensity value for each return. A total of fourteen (14) missions were flown during a period of February 07, 2012 through March 05, 2012. Two airborne global positioning system (GPS) base stations were used in support of the LiDAR data acquisition. 18 ground control points were surveyed through static methods. The geoid used to reduce satellite derived elevations to orthometric heights was Geoid09. Data for the task order is referenced to the UTM Zone 16N, North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), and NAVD88, in Meters. Airborne GPS data was differentially processed and integrated with the post processed IMU data to derive a smoothed best estimate of trajectory (SBET). The SBET was used to reduce the LiDAR slant range measurements to a raw reflective surface for each flight line. The coverage was classified to extract a bare earth digital elevation model (DEM) and separate last returns. In addition to the LAS deliverables, one layer of coverage was delivered in the IMG Format: bare-earth.",
            "Once the data acquisition and GPS processing phases are complete, the LiDAR data was processed immediately to verify the coverage had no voids. The GPS and IMU data was post processed using differential and Kalman filter algorithms to derive a best estimate of trajectory. The quality of the solution was verified to be consistent with the accuracy requirements of the project.",
            "The individual flight lines were inspected to ensure the systematic and residual errors have been identified and removed. Then, the flight lines were compared to adjacent flight lines for any mismatches to obtain a homogenous coverage throughout the project area. The point cloud underwent a classification process to determine bare-earth points and non-ground points utilizing \"first and only\" as well as \"last of many\" LiDAR returns. This process determined Default (Class 1), Ground (Class 2), Noise (Class 7), Water (Class 9), Ignored Ground (Class 10), Overlap Default (Class 17), and Overlap Ground (Class 18). The bare-earth (Class 2 - Ground) LiDAR points underwent a manual QA/QC step to verify that artifacts have been removed from the bare-earth surface. The surveyed ground control points are used to perform the accuracy checks and statistical analysis of the LiDAR dataset.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received topographic files in LAZ format. The files contained lidar elevation and intensity measurements. The data were received in UTM Zone 16 N (meters) and NAVD88 vertical datum (meters). CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The topographic laz files were converted from orthometric (NAVD88) heights to ellipsoidal heights using Geoid09. 2. The topographic laz files were transformed from UTM Zone 16N to a Geographic Coordinate system (NAD83). 3. The topographic laz files were cleaned of high and low error points and variable length records (vlr) were removed. 4. The topographic laz files' horizontal units were converted from meters to decimal degrees.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
