In this encapsulated scenario, you must allow the following items through the router instead of opening all the ports and protocols listed in this topic: If your computer network environment uses only versions of Windows earlier than Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista, you must enable connectivity over the low port range of 1025 through 5000. Low port range of 1025 through 5000 High port range of 49152 through 65535 If your computer network environment uses",

Application Layer Gateway Service This subcomponent of the Internet Connection Sharing/Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) service provides support for plug-ins that allow network protocols to pass through the firewall and work behind Internet Connection Sharing. Application Layer Gateway (ALG) plug-ins can open ports and change data (such as ports and IP addresses) that are embedded in packets. FTP is the only network protocol that has a plug-in that is included with Windows Server. The ALG FTP plug\u2013in supports active FTP sessions through the network address translation (NAT) engine that these components use. The ALG FTP plug\u2013in supports these sessions by redirecting all traffic that meets the following criteria to a private listening port in the",
