    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{115761=FIGS. 12 and 13 illustrate examples of the use of digital certificates with multimedia extensions, as set forth at steps 1012 and 1016. These examples illustrate the processes which may be performed for the checking of the validity of a driver's license, and a credit card for the performance of a transaction, respectively. Process 1200 may be an identification process used with a driver's license, for example. Once authentication of the license via examination of the certificate has taken place, the remaining information contained in the major and minor fields may be displayed to the user. These may include the display of the state logo at step 1202, display of the driver's name at step 1204, the photo of the driver at step 1206, the birth date at step 1208, and any restrictions of the driver at step 1210. This can allow verification of the identity of the holder of the certificate. The validity of the license may also be checked at step 1212, for example, by querying a remote system. If the license is not valid, the user is alerted at step 1216. If it is valid, unless other actions are required to be performed (in which case process 1200 will have additional steps), process 1200 is complete., 113102=If the certificate is authentic, then process 110 proceeds to step 1008, wherein the extension type is checked. If the examined extension type is not understood by the application program, then the criticality flag is checked at step 1014. If the extension is critical, then the use of the certificate is aborted at step 1018, and the user can be alerted at step 1007, wherein the process ends. If the certificate extension is not critical (e.g. a template extension) then the certificate can be used, if desired by the application, without the extension(s), if any at step 1016. If the extension is understood by the application, as detected at step 1010, then it can be used at step 1012 with the extension(s). In either event, the process then is complete., 112155=A flow of a process of a certificate application 110, which is resident in computer memory during system runtime in a transaction system (e.g. a point-of-sale system), is illustrated in FIG. 10. The certificate is read at step 1002. This may be performed in any number of manners, including, but not limited to, receipt of the certificate over a communication link, reading of the certificate off magnetic media on a credit/identification card, etc . . . . Authentication of the certificate is then performed at step 1004. This is performed using the specified hash algorithm of the data in the certificate, decryption technique using the public key of the issuer, and comparing the result against the supplied signature. If the certificate is not authentic, as detected at step 1006, then process 110 proceeds to step 1007, wherein a user may be alerted and the process aborts., 117784=In the event of the requirement of verification of the holder of the credit card certificate, a password may be queried for at step 1314, and if the password is not valid, as detected at step 1316, the user can be alerted at step 1312. If the password is valid, a user abort test is performed at step 1318 and if no abort is detected, the transaction is allowed to proceed, step 1320. In any event, the process is complete. Other steps may be performed within the credit card transaction application process 1300, and steps illustrated may be omitted, according to the specific application, the specific minor type of the credit card, etc . . . ., 30157=This is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/950,299 filed Oct. 14, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,878,144, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/536,271 filed Sep. 29, 1995 which matured into U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,914., 115389=Step 1112 checks the minor type in the event that the minor type is required. If understood, as detected at step 1114, then the certificate is indicated as being understood at step 1118, and the process is complete. If not, then the certificate is indicated as not being understood at step 1116, and the process is complete., 117076=Process 1300 shows an example of a credit card transaction application. Step 1302 displays the logo from the certificate. This ensures brand identity, for example, for on-line and point-of-sale transactions wherein no physical \u201ccard\u201d or medium is handled by a user. Subsequent thereto, the customer signature can be displayed at step 1304, for verification purposes, and the customer photo, if any, can be displayed at step 1306. Credit of the account is then verified at step 1308, using any known technique, and if sufficient credit does not exist as detected at step 1310, the user is alerted at step 1312. The process is then complete., 42763=In one embodiment of a transaction system 100, system 100 may be one of the IBM AT-compatible type personal computers such as the Gateway 2000 brand personal computer manufactured by Gateway Computer Systems. Processor 202 may be one of the Pentium\ufffd brand microprocessors available from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. (Pentium and Intel are trademarks of Intel Corporation)., 114556=Process 1100 shows the details of checking a template's major and minor type. First, at step 1102, the major type is checked. If it is not supported by this application, as detected at step 1104, then, at step 1106, it can be indicated that the certificate is not understood, and the process is complete. If the major type is understood by the application (e.g. an identification type), then it is determined whether the minor type is required at step 1108. For example, for a simple identification procedure with authentication, the validity of the certificate may simply be required to be checked. This would be similar to the standard X.509 authentication procedure. If not, then it the certificate is indicated as understood at step 1110, and the process is complete.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, in conclusion, a method and apparatus for formatting and using digital certificates containing extensions with multimedia data has been described. The use of certificates, as described above, as containers for data of various multimedia types is especially useful. This is particularly so for verification methods for commercial transactions, such as visual, password, and biometric verification of holders of such certificates. Although the present invention has been described with reference to certain specific embodiments thereof, the present invention should be construed as limited by the appended claims which follow. In the event of the requirement of verification of the holder of the credit card certificate, a password may be queried for at step 1314, and if the password is not valid, as detected at step 1316, the user can be alerted at step 1312. If the password is valid, a user abort test is performed at step 1318 and if no abort is detected, the transaction is allowed to proceed, step 1320. In any event, the process is complete. Other steps may be performed within the credit card transaction application process 1300, and steps illustrated may be omitted, according to the specific application, the specific minor type of the credit card, etc . . . . Process 1300 shows an example of a credit card transaction application. Step 1302 displays the logo from the certificate. This ensures brand identity, for example, for on-line and point-of-sale transactions",
