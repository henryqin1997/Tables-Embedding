That may not seem like a huge drop, but it's significant enough to wonder what exactly was going on., 120879=*Games may be switched. If Japan advances to the second round of the 2013 WBC, they will play at 7 p.m., regardless of whether they advanced as the winner or runner-up of Pool A.\u00a0, 166963=Canada shocked the United States with an 8-6 victory back in the 2006 WBC, while the U.S. got its revenge in 2009, beating the Canucks by a score of 6-5., 382068=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Bleacher Report, Inc.

As Paul Archey, president of the World Baseball Classic, told me back in September, \"There's no perfect time to hold it.\", 305484=While the bullpen is solid, the starting rotation is a bit shaky, led by former All-Star Javier Vazquez, who hasn't pitched since the 2011 season., 205280=The top-ranked team in the world by the IBAF, Cuba heads into its third World Baseball Classic looking for some revenge against Japan, the team that defeated it in the 2006 finals and in the second round of the 2009 classic., 276967=While Adrian Gonzalez picked up the fifth 100-RBI season of his career in 2012, his 18 home runs on the season were his lowest total since becoming a full-time player with the San Diego Padres in 2006, when he went deep 24 times., 306202=Drafted 32nd overall by the Minnesota Twins in the 2012 MLB draft, Berrios went 3-0 with a 1.17 ERA and 0.62 WHIP in his first taste of professional baseball, striking out 49 batters in just over 30 innings., 167517=He's been one of the most highly-touted pitching prospects in the minor leagues since arriving on the scene in 2011, and now the second-best prospect in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization (according to Baseball America)\u00a0gets to show his stuff on a global stage., 277471=It will be interesting to see whether that was the result of a tumultuous 2012 season or a sign of things to come., 180082=Now with his fifth major league franchise, the Cincinnati Reds, Chang will be counted on to help China improve upon a terrible 1-5 record in WBC play. China's lone win, a 4-1 victory over Chinese Taipei in the 2009 classic, came largely on Chang's bat, as he went 3-for-4 with a home run and two RBI., 138232=Twice, in 2003 and 2006, Baseball America\u00a0ranked Justin Huber as one of the top 100 prospects in baseball, but the left fielder/first baseman could never get things going when given a chance, posting a pretty awful .224/.276/.304 slash line in parts of five major league seasons., 220492=Despite the potential issues in the starting rotation, the Dominican Republic's offense will win games, and the matchup against Venezuela on Thursday, March 7 is must-watch baseball., 262834=A two-time Golden Glove Award winner and the 2008 KBO Batting Champion at the age of 20, Hyunsoo Kim is arguably the best player on the Korean squad., 139322=Kandilas had a solid first season at Single-A Asheville for Colorado in 2012, hitting .266 with a .360 on-base percentage and 19 stolen bases in 83 games., 104071=Not only does it bring the sport to places that it has never been before, but it opens eyes in front offices around the game, with scouts being dispatched to parts of the world never thought of as hotbeds of baseball talent prior to the first WBC, held back in 2006., 152429=Named Chicago's seventh-best prospect heading into the 2013 season by Baseball America, 24-year-old right-hander Andre Rienzo heads to the WBC with a realistic chance of making his major league debut at some point in 2013., 192131=After failing to record a win in the 2009 WBC, Chinese Taipei was forced to play in the qualifying round for this year's tournament, and it did so in impressive fashion, outscoring the opposition by a score of 35-0 in the three games needed to earn a berth., 246682=Highest\u00a0WBC\u00a0Finish:\u00a0First (2006 and 2009), 247047=Infielder\u00a0Kazuo\u00a0Matsui, 37, is the only member of Team Japan with any major league experience, having played for three different teams (the New York Mets, Colorado Rockies and Houston Astros) from 2004 through 2010., 351160=He knows how to hit, has flashed some of his natural talents in limited playing time (he missed much of 2012 due to injury) and will be a difference-maker for Venezuela when he gets a chance to play., 192892=Kuo, who from 2008 through 2010 was one of the best left-handed relievers in all of baseball for the Los Angeles Dodgers, will be asked to deliver in high-pressure situations late in the game. While he's lost something from his stuff, Kuo can still dig deep and blow it past a batter when need be., 304704=Highest\u00a0WBC\u00a0Finish:\u00a0Fifth (2006 and 2009), 249174=Expected to be posted at the end of the 2013 season, there will be a fierce bidding war for his services, as Tanaka is more than two years younger than Darvish was when he entered the posting system., 263001=He made the All-Star team at the 2009 WBC as a designated hitter after hitting .393 (11-for-28) with four RBI, six runs scored and seven walks., 249391=According to Gerry Fraley of the Dallas Morning News, the Texas Rangers have already scouted Tanaka multiple times and are thought to have serious interest in pairing him with Darvish in the rotation for 2014., 152678=Suspended for the first 50 games of the 2012 season after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs (Stanozolol), Rienzo nonetheless put together a solid season,\u00a0going 7-3 with a 2.53 ERA, 1.16 WHIP and 113 strikeouts in just over 103 innings of work at three different minor league levels., 167929=This is a guy with a ceiling so high that the Pirates ranked him above Bryce Harper heading into the 2010 MLB draft. Granted, that may be a reason why the Pirates haven't seen a playoff game in nearly 20 years, but it says a lot about Canada's most talented starting pitcher., 167326=You don't want to miss the neighborly clash when it goes down on Sunday, March 10., 247664=Abe, 33, is the reigning Central League MVP after posting a .340/.429/.565 slash line, 27 home runs and 104 RBI in 138 games during the 2012 season., 321173=Known primarily as a superb defensive outfielder\u2014Baseball America\u00a0calls him the best defensive outfielder in Texas' minor league system\u2014the 23-year-old flashed some pop at the plate in 2012, hitting a career-high 13 home runs in his second full season at Double-A Frisco., 321476=He's also got plenty of speed, setting a new career high with 36 stolen bases in 2012, getting caught only 10 times.}",

Jason Arnold/Getty Images United States (Pool D) Next \u00bb 20 of 17 \u00ab Prev Spain needs someone to be a catalyst on offense\u2014Beltre very well could be that player. He's also got plenty of speed, setting a new career high with 36 stolen bases in 2012, getting caught only 10 times.

With a rotation headed by Gonzalez and the reigning National League Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey, a bullpen full of live arms and the game's best closer over the past two seasons, Craig Kimbrel and a deep lineup, it's easy to see why that's the case. The United States lineup is littered with All-Stars and former MVP winners, a mix of seasoned veterans and young, up-and-coming stars. It's hard to find a weak spot on this roster. \u00a0 Player To Watch: Giancarlo Stanton One of the game's brightest young stars and a future MVP, nobody in the game today has as much raw power as Giancarlo Stanton, who is averaging 31 home runs and 124 games played a season. His ability to not only change the game with one swing of the bat\u2014but to hit some mammoth, regal blasts\u2014makes watching him play worth the price of admission alone. \u00ab Prev 18 of 20",
