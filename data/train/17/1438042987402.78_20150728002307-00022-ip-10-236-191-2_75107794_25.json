In both cases, the appropriate logging configuration mechanism (system properties, property files, and so on) are necessary to configure the JDK/Log4j logging libraries. Preconfigured system property override is tangosol.coherence.log.",
            "Specifies a logger name within chosen logging system that logs Coherence related messages. This value is only used by the JDK and log4j logging systems. The default value is Coherence. Preconfigured system property override is tangosol.coherence.log.logger.",

            "Specifies how messages that have a logging level specified are formatted before passing them to the log destination.

            "Specifies the maximum number of characters that the logger daemon processes from the message queue before discarding all remaining messages in the queue. Note that the message that caused the total number of characters to exceed the maximum is NOT truncated, and all messages that are discarded are summarized by the logging system with a single log entry detailing the number of messages that were discarded and their total size. The truncation of the logging is only temporary, since when the queue is processed (emptied), the logger is reset so that subsequent messages are logged. The purpose of this setting is to avoid a situation where logging can itself prevent recovery from a failing condition. For example, with tight timings, logging can actually change the timings, causing more failures and probably more logging, which becomes a vicious cycle. A limit on the logging being done at any one point in time is a \"pressure valve\" that prevents such a vicious cycle from occurring. Note that logging occurs on a dedicated low-priority thread to even further reduce its impact on the critical portions of the system. Legal values are positive integers or 0. Zero implies no limit. The default value in production mode is 4096 and 2147483647 in development mode. Preconfigured system property override is tangosol.coherence.log.limit."
