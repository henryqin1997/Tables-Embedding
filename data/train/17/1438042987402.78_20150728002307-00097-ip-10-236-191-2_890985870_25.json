            "You are always safe on this campus. There are security guards almost everywhere. In addition, the area the school is in is always being monitored and patrolled by NYPD officers!",
            "Unsure whether there are any fraternities or sororities at this university. There isn't much buzz about them, if there are any that is.",
            "York College has so many different clubs! And if it doesn't have that club that you're looking for, you and 15 other students can start one (under the right supervision of course). As far as activities are concerned, there is always one taking place somewhere.",
            "For those not trying to spend a lot on text books, there is a book bank that almost nobody knows about. They let you borrow books for the whole semester for prices as low as 30 bucks! Be sure to bring the books back on time though.",
            "Many might be astonished at the fact that there is a cemetery behind the school. Also, many of the students attending York are unaware of the , high school that is behind the school as well. Lastly, if they knew, many of the professors would frown at the fact that there is a game room.",
            "Well, York College doesn't give you your money's worth. The internet connection is always slow. Most of the computers are old and are still running on windows XP. In addition, when trying to borrow a textbook from the library, you'll be lucky if you find the pages that you need.",
            "Every Tuesday and Thursday are club hours from 12pm to 2pm. There are many activities going on and different clubs to join. Also, for those interested in games, there is a game room that has all of the game consoles.",
            "The food here at York College is good but expensive. For those who want to save as much money as possible, I would suggest bringing food from home. If not, there are various options for cheaper food around the school.",
            "Unfortunately, York College does not have any dorms. It is located on Jamaica Avenue, a very busy place. However, this facility is always open for shelter during natural disasters, for ex: hurricane sandy.",
            "There may be times where you need to contact an adviser of some sort and they're not available. There may be other times where a professor can be of no help and are forced to teach yourself a particular subject. Moreover, you can't let yourself get discouraged, just keep pushing on.",
            "Be mindful of the various resources offered at this university. Familiarize yourself with the different departments in the school. In addition, I would advise someone to acquaint themselves with someone that has experience in the field that they plan on entering.",
            "York College isn't as bad as what most people make it seem. It is really up to the person to make the best out of his experience here. Overall, this school is a good school."
