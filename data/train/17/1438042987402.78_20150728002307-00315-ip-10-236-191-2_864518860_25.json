Each filter represents a possible refinement of the search results. By using the key attribute of the filter, the same search terms will return refined results as described by the name attribute. Inheritance: LocalSearchFilter ActionScript package name: com.yahoo.maps.overlays.data.LocalSearchFilter Properties Property Description count The number of results, out of the total search results returned, that comply with this filter. key A string that specifies the key that needs to be passed back to LocalSearchOverlay.search() method to retrieve the refined results. name A string that provides a readable description of the filter. type A string that specifies the filter type, of which there are two, represented by LocalSearchFilter.TYPE_RATING and LocalSearchFilter.TYPE_CATEGORY. Rating filters allow the user to refine the search by the rating of the search results usually from one to five stars. Category filters filter by a specific category of results. For example, a search for food might return category filters with names such as \"grocery\", \"fast food\", \"cafes\", etc. TYPE_CATEGORY Possible value for the LocalSearchFilter.type property. If the type property is equal to the LocalSearchFilter.TYPE_CATEGORY constant, the search() method of the LocalSearchOverlay class can use the key attribute as its categoryFilter parameter.
