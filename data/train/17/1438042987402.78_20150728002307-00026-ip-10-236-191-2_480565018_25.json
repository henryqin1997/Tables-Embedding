J. Clin. Nutr., 53:1021S-1026S (1991)). In addition, in studies where the hypocholesterolemic effect of tocotrienols was compared with that of other drugs, the tocotrienols were more effective. For example, in a study involving chickens, T3 was demonstrated as being twice as effective as Lovastatin\u2122, a drug currently used for cholesterol control in humans. And most of the drugs most commonly used today in the therapy of hypercholesterolemia (i.e., Nicotinic acid (Grundy et al., J. Lipid Res., 22:24-36 (1981)), Compactin\u2122 and Lovastatin\u2122 (Illingworth et al., Eur. Heart J., Supp. E:103-111 (1987); Endo et al., Biotechnology, 26:301-320 (1994)), Cholestyramine\u2122 and Colestipol\u2122 (Shepherd et al., Biochem. Soc. Trans. 15:199-201 (1980)), Clofibrate\u2122 and Gemfibrosil\u2122 (Kesaniemi et al., JAMA, 251:2241-2246 (1984)) and Probucol\u2122 are known to produce various side effects (Illingworth et al., Am. J. Cardiol., 60:33G-42G (1987)). In contrast, no toxic effects were observed in the studies where tocotrienols were administered., 178678=A further characterization of the fatty acids in cranberry seed oil was performed using stereo-chemical analysis. The analysis was conducted on a silica column using a purified sample in anhydrous ether and subsequently reacted with EtMgBr for 30 sec to obtain a limited decomposition (Table 10. Verification was done by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using a hexane-ether solvent mix (50:50, v/v), which permitted the separation of the sn-1,2 and the sn-23 diglycerides., 101834=In particular, synergistic effects between the tocotrienols and flavonoids, with \u03b3-T3 and tangeretin being the most effective combination, have been observed when tested for their ability to inhibit growth in MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (IC50 0.05 \u03bcg/mL and 0.02 \u03bcg/mL, respectively) (Guthrie et al., Asia Pacific J. Clin. Nutr. 6:41-45 (1997)). In addition, with few exceptions, combinations (1:1:1) of tocotrienols, flavonoids, and tamoxifen were more effective than 1:1 combinations of T3 and flavonoids, T3 and tamoxifen, or flavonoids and tamoxifen and these are summarized in Table 5, below. The most potent combinations were \u03b3-T3/tangeretin/tamoxifen with the MDA-MB-435 cells (IC50 0.01 \u03bcg/mL), and \u03b4-T3/hesperetin/tamoxifen (IC50 0.0005 \u03bcg/mL) with the MCF-7 cells., 121924=The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for the treatment and prevention of any of the aforementioned diseases and conditions. Such methods of treatment and prophylaxis are well-recognized in the art and may be chosen by those of ordinary skill in the art from the available methods and techniques. Generally, dosage ranges may be from about 1 to about 1000 mg/day. However, lower or higher dosages may be employed. The specific dosage and treatment regimens selected will depend upon factors such as the patient's or animal's health, and the severity and course of the patient's (or animal's) condition and the judgment of the treating physician., 184969=In order to determine the particular sterol and alcohol content present in cranberry seed oil (see Table 11), the following protocol was used. An oil sample extracted according to the methods above was saponified using KOH and the unsaponifiable fraction was extracted with ether and fractionated on thin layer chromatographic plates coated with silica. The developing solvent consisted of anhydrous hexane/ether/formic acid (S0:50:1, v/v/v). The bands corresponding to sterols, 4\u03b1-methyl sterols, and triterpene alcohols were scraped and extracted at ambient temperature with anhydrous HCCl3/MeOH (90:10, v/v). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of each class was carried out via gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectrometry (MS). The amounts of the different classes were determined to be as listed below., 83613=It has been shown that increasing fat-derived energy in the diet, and increasing the linoleic acid content of diets at constant fat-derived energy, results in increased tumorigenicity (Birt et al., J. Clin., 45:203-209 (1987), Birt et al., Nutr. Rev., 48:1-(1990); Carroll et al., Current Opinion in Lipidology, 8:53-56 (1997); Erickson et al., Nutr. Rev., 48:6-14 (1990); Ip et al., Cancer Res., 45:1997-2001 (1985); Ip et al., Am. J. Clin. Nutr., 45:218-224 (1987); Thompson et al., Cancer Res., 49:1904-1908 (1989); Welsch et al., Am. J. Clin. Nutr., 45:192-303 (1987)). The effect of linoleic acid is thought to occur via its influence on prostanoid metabolism, immune response, or cell membrane structure and function. Increasing the fat-derived energy content of diets of equal linoleic acid content by the addition of palm oil did not enhance tumorigenesis in moderately exercised rats (Thompson et al., Cancer Res., 49:1904-1908 (1989)). Results reported by Sundram, et al. (Cancer Res., 49:1447-1451, (1989)) suggest that crude palm oil is more effective than refined, bleached, and deodorized palm oil in increasing the latency (the interval between administration of a carcinogen and appearance of a palpable tumor) of 7,12-dimethybenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-initiated tumorigenesis., 20125=This application claims priority to U.S. provisional Application No. 60/137,405, entitled \u201cCRANBERRY SEED OIL EXTRACT AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING COMPONENTS THEREOF,\u201d filed on Jun. 1, 1999, incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference. The contents of all patents, patent applications, and references cited throughout this specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties., 84994=The use of vitamin E as an anticarcinogenic agent has been recognized for a number of years (Haenszel et al., Int. J. Cancer, 36:43-48 (1985); Menkes et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 315:1250-1204 (1986); Stahelin et al., Ann. NY Acad. Sci., 570:391-399 (1989)). In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies, including human studies, have demonstrated that vitamin E interferes with the development of carcinogenesis that results from exposure to various environmental factors known to enhance oxidant stress (Borek et al., In, Mechanisms of cellular transformation by carcinogenic agents, New York, Pergamon (1987), Borek et al., In, Medical, biochemical and chemical aspects of free radicals, Amsterdam, Elsevier, (1989); Borek et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:1490-1494 (1986); Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA, 88:1953-1957 (1991)). In addition, \u03b1-tocopherol, a component of vitamin E, is a hydrophobic, peroxyl radical trapping, chain-breaking antioxidant found in biological membranes. Accordingly, the protective role vitamin E plays in inhibiting a variety of human malignancies is mainly attributed to its components having the ability to protect the lipid material of the organs against oxidation (Ames et al., Science 230:271-279 (1987); Doll et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 66:1193-1194 (1981): Greenwald et al., Cancer 65:1483-1490 (1990); Menzel et al., J. Agr. Food Chem., 20:481-486 (1972)).}",
