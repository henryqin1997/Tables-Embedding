    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck The prices are very good for a college at just $54.00 a credit, but you get what you pay for. Am enjoying being here Like I said in my last comment, the instructors vary in quality and the increase in online classes while dropping face to face classes in favor of online classes has really made Cochise not the college it could be. I am passing most of my classes so far with the exception of two online classes that were not offered in face to face such as juvenile justice and psychology which are low level classes that most degrees require taking. Am learning a lot Some of my classes were interesting and I learned a lot. The placement test isn't the greatest of tests though, I tested into English 102 and maxed out the reading test, but because of the test score difference between the two tests, I had to come in and write an assigned essay, the essay assigned was not a good test of English and writing skills and so they then said the essay put me into English 100 which is two grades lower than what I tested into the first time. So then I had to take two more classes",
