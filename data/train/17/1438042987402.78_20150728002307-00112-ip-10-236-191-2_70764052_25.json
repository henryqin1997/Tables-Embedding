The Regiment in practically the same formation as the previous day formed up and advanced in the general direction of Catillon, maintaining connection on its flanks. At 8:30 the town of Mazingheim was captured by 119th which continued to advance, until it had reached the high ground east of Mazingheim overlooking the Sombre Canal. Here very stout Machine Gun opposition was met, and the line held up for awhile. Supporting Machine Guns, Stokes Mortars, and One Pounders were sent up to protect the front from any counter-attack and did good work in putting out several enemy Machine Gun posts. Practically no advance was made beyond this high ground that afternoon, due to the very open country and the deadly fire from the German Machine Guns., 93039=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 7:30 a. m., on the morning of August 31st, the troops composing the attack of the 119th Infantry Regiment had reached the line Voormezeele-Switch in I. 31. 6. and I. 32. A., 157340=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the afternoon of the 16th of October, in accordance with instructions the Regiment moved to the woods immediately southwest of Busigny, where it bivouacked for the, 25028=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this area the Regiment underwent a most intensive training schedule. Since it was to be affiliated with the British, their methods, the development of four years of painstaking study, was adopted. The 39th British Division, which was associated with the 30th (American) Division arranged to give assistance in training in an advisory capacity, by the attachment of British officers and N. C. O.'s to American units, and by the maintenance of close personal touch, also by the interchange of Staff Officers between the Staffs of the British formation and the corresponding Staffs of the 30th Division. The 119th Infantry was very fortunate in receiving a cadre of instructors from the 9th Black Watch and the 9th and 10th Gordon Highlanders, under the command of Brig. Gen. N. S. Hubbard, 118th Infantry Brigade (British) and under the direct supervision of Col. Cruickshenk, Lt.-Col. Sworder, Lt.-Col. Lord Gordon and Lt.-Col. Anderson. The training was divided into two phases, i. e.: A and B. While in this area, phase A was mastered. This training consisted of 36 hours of instruction for the first week, 25 hours for the second week, 26 hours for the third week, and 20 hours for the fourth week. Realizing that every minute must be taken advantage of, the men worked most industriously, with a spirit at which our Allies marvelled. The training of specialists received the most careful attention, as did the training of the Infantry platoons. It was due, in a great way, to this thorough training that the later phenomenal success of the Regiment in actual battle is attributed.

I did, however, have the privilege of commanding the 119th Infantry for several months during your temporary absence, and I can but believe that the excellent spirit and morale which existed in that Regiment was largely the result of your work. I have seen personally no regiment formed during the war where officers and men gave a better or more loyal response under rather difficult conditions of training: Of the Regiment's work on this side I know only through hearsay, but comment that I have heard from outside the Regiment and Division has been most favorable., 99538=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All guides will assemble at Road Junction H. 22. a. 35. 85., at 8:30 p. m., September 3rd, 1918., 62047=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01st and 2nd Battalions, 120th Infantry Regiment are each sending advance parties of 1 officer per Battalion Headquarters, 1 officer per Company and 1 N. C. O. per Platoon, to report to the 1st and 2nd Battalion Hqrs., 119th Infantry Regiment, respectively, at 3:00 p. m., August 16th. These parties will take over all dumps of ammunition, and all trench and area stores in the Yellow Line., 53309=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. On the night of 16-17 August, 1918, the 119th Inf. will relieve the 98th British Brigade in the right sub-sector of the 33rd British Divisional Front., 54628=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These men will make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the area to be taken over on the night of 16-17 August, and will take over from the British units, defense schemes, maps, dumps of ammunition, grenades, etc., and all trench stores., 39229=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) Column will march with 100 yd. intervals between Companies; 100 yd. interval between unit and its transport; and 25 yd. intervals between each section of six vehicles., 37763=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. This Regiment, in conjunction with the remainder of the 60th Infantry Brigade, will commence training under Phase \"B\" scheme, July 16, 1918., 114435=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0September 22nd, the following Regimental Order was issued:, 119914=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. The 60th Infantry Brigade (less 115th M. G. Bn. and Regimental M. G. Co.), will relieve the 118th Infantry in the present sector on the night of 27th-28th of September., 152658=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Regiment in the same formation as the previous day resumed the attack at 5:30 a. m., October 9th, with, 49173=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 3rd Battalion occupied the Blue Line during the period that the 2nd Battalion was in the forward position then relieved the 2nd Battalion in the Canal sector on the night of August 1-2, 1918. A detachment from the Signal Platoon from Headquarters Company under command of 1st Lieut. Nathaniel Hannau, accompanied the Battalion into line., 38133=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) The 2nd Bn., will march on Zwynland Brewery at time to be designated on July 16, 1918., 58397=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. The 119th Infantry Regiment (less 3rd Bn.) will relieve the 98th British Brigade in the right sub-sector of the Canal sector on the night of August 16th and 17th., 64679=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following morning, August 16th, orders were issued for moving the 3rd Battalion, 119th Infantry Regiment from the Green Line to the right sub-sector of the Yellow Line., 20541=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third detachment, consisting of the 3rd Battalion Headquarters, Companies D, I, K, L, and M, under command of Major William S. Privott, left Camp Merritt, May 10th, and proceeded by rail to Boston, Mass., arriving there about 10:00 a. m., the 11th, and embarked that afternoon on the British Steamship \"Laomadon\"., 148836=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October 7th, the march was continued to the town of Estrees where the Regiment halted for the night., 42375=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b-1) The 3rd Bn., during the absence from this area of the 1st and 3rd Bns. 120th Inf. will march from the present camp by the most convenient route to the Blue Line and will cover the left subsector forward line with 3 Cos., extending from G. 9. c. 5. 2. and G. 15. a. 7. 0.

The 119th Infantry Regiment will relieve the 19th British Brigade in the Reserve Brigade Area of the 33rd British Division the night of 15-16 August, 1918, in accordance with attached table. All moves will be by platoon at 100 yds. intervals. Battalions will send advance parties of one officer, per Bn. Hqrs. and one officer per Company to report to Hqrs. of the British Bns., to be relieved at 5 p. m., today. The Hqrs. Company will send one officer and one N. C. O. per platoon to the 19th British Brigade Hqrs., at 5 p. m., today., 21296=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While in this harbor the convoy was formed, consisting of these three Transports and nine others. On the afternoon of May 16th, the convoy sailed for England. The \"Ascania\" was the flag-ship, and carried the Commodore of the convoy--Lieut. Commander Underwood, of the British Navy. The convoy was escorted by the British Cruiser \"Cornwall\"., 152066=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The attack order for the advance on the morning of October 9th, was received at Regimental Headquarters about 3:30 a. m., and transmitted to the Battalion Commanders and front line troops by 4:30 a. m. A runner was the only means of communication at this time. In the attack order the barrage was timed to open at 5:00 o'clock, but later was changed to begin at 5:30, and, had it not been for the fact that the attack orders were late in arriving at the front line, this difference of 30 minutes might have caused disastrous results., 64910=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon moving into the front line on night of August 16-17, the 119th Infantry Regiment took over from the 98th British Brigade in the following order:, 115464=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Billeting parties under command of Division Billeting Officer proceeded to new area at 9:00 a. m., 21st of September., 143597=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Owing to the magnitude of the offensive, it was deemed necessary as a precautionary measure to further protect the left flank which had suffered so heavily during the engagement, against a possible counter-attack by the enemy. For this purpose one Battalion of the 118th Infantry was sent to the Regimental Commander to be used as he deemed necessary. He in turn sent the Battalion forward to occupy a trench which ran from the Canal in a westerly direction. This Battalion completed the occupation at about 12:30 a. m., the morning of September 30th, 1918. The counterattack never materialized., 169950=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here all the men in the Regiment from North Carolina, were mustered out of the service between the 6th and 10th, and those from Tennessee were sent to Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., April 9th, to be mustered out there. The remaining men in the Regiment from other States were transferred as Camp Detachments and ordered to the nearest Demobilization Camp to their homes and discharged. The following Camp Detachments were sent from the Regiment:, 115837=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Units leaving nights 23-24 of September will carry Iron Rations only., 53521=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08. Advance parties as usual will report at Regimental Hqrs., at 6:00 p. m., today and proceed to the light railway from Remy Siding to Brisbane where they will be met by guides from the 98th British Brigade and taken into the line., 126382=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the night of September 28-29th, the tape was laid by the 105th Engineers. Due to casualties, however, this task was completed by officers of this Regiment. The Tanks which were to assist in the attack were led into position; and the Infantry took their place upon the tape in the following order: 1st Battalion, commanded by Capt. Otho Robinson, with \"A\" and \"D\" assaulting Companies and Companies \"B\" and \"C\" in close support. 2nd Battalion, commanded by Capt. Graham K. Hobbs, with \"F\" and \"G\" assaulting Companies with \"E\" and \"H\" in close support. 3rd Battalion, commanded by Major William S. Privott, with the exception of \"M\" Company, which was broken up into carrying parties, was assigned as \"moppers up\", to follow the two front line Battalions and clean up all the trenches, dug-outs, and machine gun posts, taken by them. \"I\" and \"L\" Companies were to mop up the Tunnel alone. Company \"K\" assisted in the \"mopping up\", but was later called upon to protect the left flank of the 2nd Battalion., 28993=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 119th Infantry Regiment was inspected almost immediately upon its arrival in this area by Major Gen. Herbert Plummer, Commander of the 2nd British Army. A week later Field Marshall Sir Douglas Haig, Commander of the British Armies in France, honored this Regiment by giving it a most rigid inspection. Both of these officers expressed great delight in the progress of the training and the wonderful physique of the men. On or about the 30th day of June, Gen. John J. Pershing, Commander in Chief of the American Armies in France, inspected the Regiment. He was pleased with the fitness of the troops and especially the high standard of the personnel, expressing himself that he had not seen a better body of men in the American Expeditionary Forces., 95785=119th Infantry Regiment and the advance party of the 118th Infantry Regiment rejoined their organization September 1st, 1918., 120144=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02 (a) The 119th Infantry will relieve the troops of the 118th Infantry holding the area bounded on the North by a certain line running through A. 26, C. 9,9 and on the South by a line running through L. 16. B. 0. 9. G. 8. 6. 6. 6., to the road along Sentinel Ridge towards Bellicourt, in accordance with attached table \"A\"--Relief to be completed by 2:00 a. m., 155600=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the morning of October 10th, since the 120th Infantry had not come up on the line, the plan of the attack was not enforced but instead the Regiment merely exploited a short distance immediately forward of this position. After the hard fighting of the 8th and 9th, the men were completely worn out and ready for a rest. However, their high standard of morale had never waned. On the afternoon of the 10th, orders were received for the relief of the Regiment by the 108th Infantry Regiment of the 27th American Division. This relief, due to the fact that some of the units of the 108th Infantry became separated from the rest of the organization, was not completed until after daylight on the morning of the 11th of October. The troops moving from the front line positions could plainly be seen by the enemy who immediately fired on them with Artillery. The Regiment moved by marching back to Premont, where it remained until the same afternoon when it marched to the area around Van le Prettre Farm. Here it was billeted for the night of October 11th-12th. Due to a mistake, the allotment of billeting area by Corps Headquarters, the Regiment was compelled to move to the area surrounding Montbrohain, while Regimental Headquarters was established in the village., 62495=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09. 119th Regiment Machine Gun Company will march from its present camp at 3:00 p. m., August 16th, to Chinese camp, G. 3. d. 6. 4, and will come under the orders O. C. 33rd British Battalion, M. G. C., on arrival., 22374=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About 11:30 p. m., May 26th, a German submarine was sighted within very close range, but it immediately submerged and was not seen again. The crafty Destroyers were on their job and dropped several \"depth bombs\" at the spot where the submarine had been seen. No disorder or confusion among the troops was caused during these crucial moments., 108162=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the 17th day of September, 1918, the Regiment moved by rail pursuant to the following order to the Puchevillere Area:, 95235=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On August 29th, 1918, orders were issued to the effect that the 118th Infantry Regiment (American) would relieve the 119th Infantry Regiment (American) on night of 31st, August and 1st September. Advance parties were sent to join the 119th Infantry in order that they might become acquainted and familiar with the front which their regiment was ordered to take over in a couple of days. This relief never took place on account of the advance made by the, 5025=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Original grammar, punctuation, and spelling have been preserved. Encountered typographical errors have been preserved, and appear in red type., 67645=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the night of August 21-22, 1918, the 3rd Battalion, commanded by Major William S. Privott, which was then in the Yellow Line relieved the 1st Battalion, 119th Infantry Regiment, then in right Regimental front. The 1st Battalion upon being relieved withdrew to the same position vacated by the 3rd Battalion. The disposition of the 3rd Battalion was as follows:, 147067=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The field over which this fight took place, on the 30th day of September, presented a miserable appearance, as dead soldiers were scattered broadcast over its area. Shell holes were so numerous that one could not walk three steps without falling into one. Huge masses of barbed wire had been partly cut by the bombardment and the Tanks. Not a telephone pole nor a tree had been left standing by the sweeping Artillery fire. The town of Bellicourt was a complete wreck., 36406=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To better understand the subsequent work of the Regiment it is here necessary to explain somewhat in detail the former training which was conducted under the heading of Phase B training. This consisted of one Battalion at a time going into the line and being associated with the British units then occupying the position and also to strengthen the line as it was very lightly held. The command and the responsibility for this sector was retained by the British while the Americans were given every opportunity to accustom themselves with trench life and conditions. This method of training was to continue until the entire outfit had been able to take advantage of the opportunity. Phase B training was commenced in the Regiment by the following order, July 16, 1918:, 94737=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two platoons of Machine Gun Company, 119th Infantry Regiment came back in the line August 31st for the attack; one platoon was with the 1st Battalion and one with the 3rd Battalion. The other platoons remained in reserve. (It is well to note here that the 119th Infantry was the first American unit to take over a front line sector in Belgium, the first to make an advance, the first to capture a prisoner and the first to capture a town.), 34905=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After resting up from the four-day march, the Regiment resumed the training schedule with renewed energy. The front line at its closest point was about 12 kilometers distance, consequently the firing of artillery could be heard at all times, and even the bursting of shells, for on several occasions the town of Watou, where Division Headquarters was located was shelled. The shells passing directly over the Camp. Here also the men of the Regiment became thoroughly accustomed to enemy air raids. Practically every clear night there were numbers of German planes overhead bombing important cross-roads and camps. The transports carrying rations forward to the men in the line also presented a favorite target., 29805=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About the 15th of June, information was received that an attack by the Germans was anticipated in the sector immediately east of Cassel. In anticipation of this plan of attack arrangements were perfected whereby the 30th Division was to take up a position in reserve, west of Cassel. The 119th Infantry was designated to be the Divisional Reserve which, as expressed to the Commanding Officer by Gen. Faison, was a very important position in the scheme of defense. The Regiment was preparing for this move with great enthusiasm. This position, however, was never occupied. The orders were unexpectedly changed and this Regiment with the other units of the Division, on the 2nd day of July, 1918, proceeded by marching to the Roozendaal and Road Camp Areas, near Watou, Belgium., 38809=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.

O,--Road Intersection L. 21. c. 95. 95.--thence along Main Abeele-Poperinghe Road to Zwynland Brewery, where guides from 33rd British Division will be met to conduct the Bn., into bivouac along the East Poperinghe Line., 115968=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Regimental Headquarters will close at Lealvillers at 5:30 p. m., 23rd of September, and open at time and place to be announced later., 153134=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The advance continued without meeting very strong resistance until the town of St. Souplet on the west bank of the LaSalle River was reached; about 3:00 o'clock that afternoon., 148998=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The night or the portion of night spent here was marked by a most terrific bombardment from the air. No casualties in the Regiment, however, resulted from this attack. Shortly after midnight verbal orders were received from the Commanding General, 60th Brigade, by the Commanding Officer of the Regiment to proceed to the vicinity of Premont and follow the attack of the 117th Infantry which would begin at 6:00 a. m., October 8th, passing through or \"leap-frogging\" the 117th at the railroad fill immediately west of Busigny., 125613=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(5) Troops will march off roads as much as possible., 14368=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Between January 1st, 1918, and April 1st, 1918, the Regimental Commander was in attendance at a Brigade and Field Officers' School at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. During his absence the Regiment was commanded by Col. F. LeJ. Parker, of the Regular Army, and his work for these three months greatly assisted in the building of the backbone of the Regiment. Many competitive drills and exercises were held during this time which assisted in establishing a keen spirit of competition, which the Regiment lived up to in later months., 155030=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The night of the 9th-10th of October was spent in consolidating the captured position and to gain contact with the unit on the right which had been held up by Machine, 17672=the Pantinzer Barracks, about 4 kilometers from Brest. On May 23rd, 1918, the party left Brest for Langres and arrived there May 25th, 1918. The entire detachment was here separated into different groups and commenced special training for which they were sent over. Some officers attended the School of the Line, the remainder the Specialist School. Upon the completion of the course the officers taking the Specialist and Line courses left Langres June 24th, 1918, and rejoined the Regiment which was stationed in the Racques Area, at Louches, on June 27th, 1918. Major George K. Freeman and Major Roane Waring were transferred from the School of the Line to the Staff College before the completion of the course. These two officers were not reassigned to the Regiment., 13792=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These instructors were specialists in their work, and this Regiment was fortunate in getting one for each branch of its training, namely: musketry and bayonet, gas defense, grenades, sniping and observation, stokes mortar, one pounder, and signal work. Beginning at about the 1st of January, 1918, detachments of officers from the 30th Division were sent each month to the School of Arms, at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and the training for the officers continued until the Regiment was ready to depart for Overseas service., 160550=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About 7:30 o'clock information was received that the British on the right had moved up to the prolongation of our front line, and were continuing the advance. Information was also received that the 27th Division (American) had succeeded in pushing its line forward., 52899=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Completion of relief will be reported to Regimental Headquarters. Regimental Headquarters will close at Bayly Camp and reopen at Elizabeth Chateau (G. 8. a. 2. 2.) at 9:00 p. m., tonight, August 15., 162195=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About 3:30 that morning orders were received that the attack would resume at 7:00 o'clock on the entire Corps, 96674=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On September 2nd, 1918, the following orders were issued relieving the 119th Infantry Regiment from the line:, 20114=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 2nd Battalion, consisting of Battalion Headquarters, Companies E, F, G, and H, under command of Captain Edgar H. Bain, left Camp Merritt, May 10th, and proceeded by rail to Philadelphia, Pa., arriving on the morning of the 11th.

After confidence was thus gained the separate units were grouped together and a British platoon was placed on either side of an American platoon. On the 23rd day of July, after the Battalion had been in line for a period of six days the British withdrew to the Yellow Line or the Regimental Reserve Line and the 1st Battalion held the front line position alone until relieved by the 2nd Battalion on the night of July 24-25, 1918., 125102=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1) The relief to be completed by 2:00 a. m., 908355=Combined Operations Map 30th Div.

Here the position was consolidated and the men dug in for the night. This position was very heavily shelled and quite a number of casualties resulted. The command of the sector officially passed from the Commanding General, 59th Brigade, to the Commanding General, 60th Brigade, at sundown the same evening. With the passing of the command the 59th Brigade supported the 60th Brigade in its advance., 57860=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On August 15th, 1918, the following order was issued from Headquarters 119th Infantry:, 11028=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 2nd North Carolina Infantry which went into Federal service June 16th, 1916, and spent six months on the Mexican Border was never mustered out upon its return, but proceeded to Camp Sevier, Greenville, South Carolina, August 1st, 1917.

At exactly 5:50 a. m., the most terrific barrage ever laid down on the Western Front opened and the Infantry following it as closely as possible, assisted by such a density of fog and smoke that a person could not be seen at a distance greater than five yards, succeeded in making its way through the strong fortifications assisting the 120th Infantry in the capture of the town of Bellicourt and the St. Quentin Canal, pushing forward towards its objective. The fog and smoke caused quite a bit of confusion. No one, except with the aid of a compass, could keep the proper direction, consequently the Companies became very much mixed and scattered, a situation which might have been more serious but for the work of the officers, the training of the men and the utter rout of the enemy., 68423=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the night of the 22-23 of August, the Machine Gun Company was relieved by Company \"B\", 115th Machine, 67203=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the 33rd British Division was relieved on August 16-17, the 98th British Artillery Brigade, commanded by Colonel Butler, remained in the line supporting the right sub-sector until about August 25th, when it was relieved by the -- British Artillery Brigade, commanded by Colonel Ladd, with headquarters at Assan Farm and was still in the line when the 30th Division was relieved., 101675=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0September 5th, 1918, the following orders were received:, 90906=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About the night of 27-28 of August, Company \"M\" was relieved by Companies \"I\" and \"L\", and \"M\" Company withdrew to Ottawa Farm.
