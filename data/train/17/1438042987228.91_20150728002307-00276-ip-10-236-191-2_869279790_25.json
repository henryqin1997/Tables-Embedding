Here's a look at the nation's 10 top returning rushers: Running royalty Hampton will try to join a fraternity of standout Hawkeyes running backs of recent vintage that includes Nick Bell, Albert Young, Ladell Betts, Ronnie Harmon and Fred Russell. \"He isn't as big as Shonn, but he's a hard-nosed, tough, aggressive runner,\" Ferentz says. \"He isn't a blazer, but he has good speed.\" Now, with Greene gone, it's Hampton's turn.

    "textAfterTable": "\"I don't think the game plan is really going to change; it's just a different person in the backfield,\" says Hampton, who was a high school teammate of Virginia Tech tailback Darren Evans at Indianapolis Warren Central. \"The offensive program is going to keep running. I know it's going to be here when I'm gone, too. It's going to stay the same.\" Hampton, who is 5 feet 9 and 210 pounds, surprised many last fall as a true freshman, when he rushed for 463 yards and seven touchdowns; the touchdown total set a school record for a freshman. \"Jewel played really well,\" tight end Tony Moeaki says. \"At the same time, Shonn was a freak last year, almost like a superhero. It will be tough to replace Shonn, but it will be exciting because all of the guys on offense have to raise our level of play to make up for his absence.\" Iowa got a scare over the summer when Hampton suffered a knee injury in workouts. And he recently aggravated the injury and is listed as day to day. That somewhat clouds the picture in Iowa City. The Hawkeyes, ranked No. 21 in the coaches' preseason poll, are a sleeper contender in the Big Ten. There are eight starters back on defense, which paced the Big Ten and ranked fifth in the nation in scoring defense (13.0 points per",
