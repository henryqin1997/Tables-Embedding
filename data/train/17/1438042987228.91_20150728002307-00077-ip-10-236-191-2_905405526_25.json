The Student Teacher ratio is 1:13 so interaction with the academic staff is never impossible. The Professors are strict on their due dates for projects, so that is good, but if you have a sensible excuse as to why you cannot submit in time, the Professors are very understanding. Any problem you have, whether academic, social, personal, or probably you are not just sure of what you want to do in life anymore, Clarkson University has a really good reputation in putting you back on track, and I'm not just saying this, but I'm talking from experience.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck The price may seem a little overwhelming at first, but the price is reasonable for the type of college that Clarkson is and the college does its best to help with financial aid to lower your costs to go here. Am enjoying being here In my case, college isn't my favorite. I'm not a very social person, so I don't hang out with too many people. And since Clarkson is in the middle of nowhere, there's not much to do up here. Don't plan on coming here if you enjoy city life. Am learning a lot This college is very demanding when it comes to some subjects and very laid back when it comes to others. The big 3 courses, physics, chemistry, and calculus, serve as a filter for the students. If you can't keep up and learn the material, you might want to consider a different school. The classes can also be somewhat labor intensive at times. Login to rate or flag the reviews Casey from Lancaster 06/28/2011 Reviewer is A current student here.",
