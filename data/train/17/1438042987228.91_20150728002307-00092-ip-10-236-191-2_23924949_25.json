The top of their draft was all about instant help. Outside linebacker Dion Jordan, cornerback Jamar Taylor and guard/tackle Dallas Thomas all represent instant upgrades to their starting lineup., 164372=No wonder: Austin is the last piece of a balanced Rams offense that could take a big leap forward in 2013. The explosive Austin gives Sam Bradford a terrifying weapon at last. The other young receivers and backs (including third-rounder Stedman Bailey, Austin's Mountaineer teammate) combined behind an offensive line now anchored by Jake Long could be something to behold., 111023=There's something to be said for a team that knows exactly what it needs and takes it. Safety Kenny Vaccaro adds desperately needed talent and athleticism to a secondary that had little of it in 2012. Tackle Terron Armstead was great value in the third round and should ease the loss of free-agent left tackle Jermon Bushrod., 169632=With the massive flop of 2012 big-money free-agent cornerback Eric Wright, the Buccaneers had a crystal-clear need for Mississippi State cornerback Johnthan Banks. Banks has great height, good speed and natural cover skills. Though he was a bit of a reach at No. 43, he'll be a good player for the Bucs., 205442=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Bleacher Report, Inc.

How did each team do? What players did each team pick? How well did each pick meet his team's needs? How well did each team work the board? Some didn't do much of either. Some teams did a better job of meeting needs. Others did a better job of getting value for their picks. That's the beauty of the NFL draft: All 32 teams just got better. Every team just added a big group of young, talented players, all of whom could become a franchise mainstay. Now that all 254 picks in the NFL's annual player selection meeting have been spent and 254 young men have taken the first step in their incredible new line of work, we can look",
    "textAfterTable": "6 (174) Swope, R. WR TA&M 6 (187) Ellington, A. RB CLEM 7 (219) Jefferson, D. TE RUTG The Arizona Cardinals wasted no time addressing what was one of the worst offensive lines in football last season. Strong, athletic No. 7 overall pick Jonathan Cooper will be one of the best guards in the NFL from Day 1, and fourth-round pick Earl Watford should have every opportunity to start at the other guard spot. Inside linebacker Kevin Minter represented good value at No. 45, while defensive end Alex Okafor was a steal in the early fourth round. Whether Okafor has the bulk to play end in the Cardinals' 3-4, though, remains to be seen. The Cardinals also picked up a pair of running backs, Stepfan Taylor and Andre Ellington, who should compete to push free-agent signee Rashard Mendenhall right away. Ellington, particularly, was good value. Receiver Ryan Swope was another explosive, productive college football player who slid further than he should have. I would have preferred to see the Cardinals snag one of the many talented developmental quarterbacks late to develop behind Carson Palmer and Drew Stanton. Additionally, the writing is on the wall for Darnell Dockett and his relationship with the team;",
