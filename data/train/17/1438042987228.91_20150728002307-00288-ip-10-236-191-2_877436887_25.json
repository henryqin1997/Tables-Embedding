It is a very welcoming college and I would recommend it for anyone I know., 89816=Drake offers a bunch of different clubs and activities. There is an activities fair during the beginning of September where all of the clubs have a table set up and you can get any info on the club. The one thing about signing up for the clubs is that they never take you off their emailing list, so even if you do not join the club you will constantly get emails from the club, for all four years that you are here! Also there is a business fraternity and two pharmacy fraternities and many pre-prefessional clubs for those who want to make their resume look extra nice!, 225457=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Drake is expensive. Then again, so is every other college. The main reason I picked Drake was because of the financial aid they gave me. It was substantially more than any other college I applied to. We also get more for our money. Drake really prepares you for the real world. Professors and advisers let you in on little hints that make life and job hunting so much easier! Drake is expensive, but they have excellent financial aid and it will be worth the loans upon graduation! Am enjoying being here I love Drake; coming here was one of the best decisions of my life. On the other hand, I know some of my friends don't like it as much as I do. My advice is check out the college a few times. The first time I visited campus I hated it. If I had written it off and not come back, I would be stuck at a college back home. The campus is great for studying and playing outside, and the city is just a short bus trip away. All around campus are tons of fun things to do and great places to explore. Am learning a lot You get out of Drake what you put",
