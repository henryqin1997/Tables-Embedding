            "There are lots of on-campus dining options in their SUB, but prices are a bit, well, pricey.",
            "I wasn't able to check it out...hence, the low score.",
            "I would say that the acedemic rigor at Weber is fairly up there...While it may not be the easiest, it's definately not the hardest either; but, that doesn't mean you won't have to work hard for your grades and your degree...you definatley will have to work hard!",
            "Be sure to take a walk around campus before any classes start! It is a big campus! Also, be sure to check with your advisor(s) to see if your credits will transfer. Depending on your current school, Weber might accept most to all of them. Again, that depends upon the school you are currently attending.",
            "This is an absolutely beautiful school! Not only is it located at the foot of the mountains, but they also have a fairly large campus that offers many opportunites to all the students there. Their English program is especially comprehensive, and all undergraduate students have the chance to participate in the National Undergraduate Literature Conference, hosted by Weber State University each spring."

(There is a reason 2002 Winter Olympics were held here), 304251=DO NOT buy books from the Weber State bookstore. Buy them online or rent them, you save hundreds of dollars. Figure out parking early, if you don't get to campus before 8:30 A.M. you won't get a spot on campus., 481659=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 222686=Whoever kisses there partner at 12:00 for 30 secs straight under some tree or something on wildcat day gets a free parking pass., 75433=Weber State is really affordable, especially if you can get in-state tuition like I did. Even though I'm technically an out of state student, I was able to get the Weber Edge Scholarship which pays for the out-of-state portion of tuition (which also isn't bad), and now I have in-state tuition! I love it here and would recommend their hybrid classes, which allow you to get the same credit in half the time - my hybrid classes ends October 17 and I still get 3 credit hours!, 478547=There was an incident with cheating in the math department this year. I felt like my classes offered a challenge for me. My 1010 Psychology class seemed a little elementary, but still intriguing., 121533=Ogden Greek Festival every October. Great food, great people, lots of fun and great opportunities for a multicultural experience.}",

I've seen high school kids and 60+ year olds in my classes. The majority of people on campus are commuters, but they do have on-campus housing options. Weber is great for those who want to learn but don't have a lot to spend. It is definitely not a party school, though; no drugs and alcohol allowed on campus, and you will actually learn something. Tips for prospective students Get involved. It's the only way to have fun. They have a club for EVERYTHING. From ballroom to anime to martial arts and beyond, there's nothing that can't entertain you on campus. Also, get to know your professors. I recommend dropping by their offices in the first three weeks of class, at least those you plan to work hard for. They're bored during that time anyways,",
