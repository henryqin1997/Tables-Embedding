Neighbor 10.2.3.4 is a router inside the confederation. Neighbor 172.20.16.6 is outside the routing domain confederation.

Multiple paths are installed for external peers that are from the same autonomous system and are equal cost (according to the BGP best-path algorithm). Similarly, multiple paths are installed for internal peers that are equal cost based on the BGP best-path algorithm. The IGP metric to the BGP next hop is the same as the best-path IGP metric unless the router is configured for unequal cost iBGP multipath or eiBGP multipath.
