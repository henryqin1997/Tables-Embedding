Corvette Racing fans will be able to give the American Le Mans Series' most successful team a grand send-off before the twin Compuware Corvette C6.R race cars begin their transatlantic journey to France, where they'll compete in the world's biggest sports car race on June 12-13., 179794=It is at Barcelona that Hamilton, 25, has chosen to respond to local hero Alonso's claim that the 2008 world champion is now on the verge of receiving penalties by the stewards., 285995=The Frenchman put the #3 908 HDi FAP to the top of the times halfway through the 20-minute session.\u00a0 Timo Bernhard qualified second for the 1000 km of Spa-Francorchamps (Belgium) with a time of 1m 58.519s (212.746 km/h). On the 7.004-km track, the German was just 0.635 seconds slower than pole setter S\u00e9bastien Bourdais in the Peugeot 908. Audi Sport Team Joest had expected a bigger gap because, in contrast to the competition, all three Audi R15 TDI prototypes are running in full Le Mans spec - and thus with much less down force than usual at Spa-Francorchamps., 190557=The following are thus invited to attend scrutineering for the 78th Le Mans 24 Hours (6-7 June 2010), and have been included on the official list of entries for the event., 139769=\"As far as the 2013 engine is concerned, I think that Formula One does need to move on and show that it is moving in a fuel-efficiency age,\" he said., 139846=A move to a 1.5-litre turbo engine and KERS has been mooted for 2013., 176650=In 2008, 62,000 spectators attended the Hockenheim race., 182665=The Italian tire company last week revealed that it was to perform a U-turn on previously stated claims that it had no interest in replacing Bridgestone for 2011, but its confirmation sparked concern among WRC competitors, who feared that relationships built up in recent years would be ended at a stroke. Adding to the fears is the fact that Pirelli is in the final year of a three-year deal to supply control tires to the WRC and the 'junior' championships running under its umbrella, but a company spokesman insists that its backing for rallying remains strong., 148407=Mercedes has heavily updated its 2010 car for the Spanish grand prix, including a longer wheelbase that is touted to suit 41-year-old Schumacher's famous affection for strong front-end handling., 134843=But now that he has switched to Ferrari, the grandstands are set to remain blue in 2010, due to the newly-launched Ferrari T-shirt that is not scarlet red., 176847=But he is quoted by the German news agency SID as confirming that ticket sales did increase in the wake of Schumacher's decision to return, meaning that the event should break even in 2010., 146154=The session opened with a bang as Jules Bianchi followed the rear wing of Perez a little too closely on their warm up lap: the Mexican spun gently into the gravel but found his way back to the pits just behind his French rival, while a few turns later Jerome d'Ambrosio found the wall at turn 9, bringing his session to an early end. But back on track Bird set the early running with a lap of 1:28.511 and continued to push as Perez and Bianchi sat just below him on the screens. The Briton went even faster just before the usual rush for fresh rubber just before the halfway mark of the season, with Pic staying out a lap longer to get some clear air and his best time. And the story of the session was told: with the teams concentrating on set up ahead of this afternoon's qualifying session the timesheets saw little movement as the clock wound down to zero., 259138=\u201cWe\u00a0 will\u00a0 see\u00a0 whether\u00a0 we can return there in 2011. Meanwhile, we will not replace this round in 2010, and therefore will now have twenty races on our calendar.\u201d, 271305=The gap between the pair on the Barcelona grid is six tenths and five grid positions, meaning that Massa has only outqualified Alonso once in 2010., 269546=Michael Schumacher on Saturday was happy to have outqualified a teammate for the first time since 2006, but he also admitted to being humbled by the 1.3 second gap to pole position., 253533=RSC Mucke Motorsport continued their strong weekend and Nigel Melker crossed the line seconds later posting a time of 1:52.602 and holding on to the top spot despite last ditch attempts from the remainder of the field. Pal Varhaug then put in an extremely impressive performance for Jenzer Motorsport, the young Norwegian improving lap after lap in the dying moments, his last lap time of 1:52.931 enough to knock Wickens down into third. Daniel Morad finished the thrilling session in fourth with a time of 1:53.311, followed by James Jakes for Manor in fifth spot with a time of 1:53.440. Dean Smith flied up the time sheet on new rubber, ending in sixth spot for Carlin, and in a surprise seventh spot for ART was one of the pole favorites Estenban Gutierrez., 232717=Pirelli applies to be sole tire supplier (GMM)\u00a0 Pirelli has submitted an official application to supply tires to formula one teams in 2011., 264169=The outright open-wheel lap record of 20.016 sec. (123.381 mph) was set by Jason McCord in an 800-horsepower USAC Sprint Car in 2001.\u00a0 Jason Leffler set the lap record of 20.298 sec. (121.667 mph) in his 700-horsepower Silver Crown car in 2001 and the lap record for the 350 horsepower USAC midgets was set in 1997 by Chris Schultz at 20.373 mph (121.219 mph).\u00a0 The Star Mazda race car weighs 1,335 pounds with fuel and driver and the Mazda 'Renesis' rotary engine produces 250 horsepower., 259808=GP2\u00a0 Series\u00a0 organizer\u00a0 Bruno\u00a0 Michel\u00a0 explained:\u00a0 \u201cWe\u00a0 are\u00a0 disappointed\u00a0 to\u00a0 have\u00a0 to\u00a0 cancel Portimao\u00a0 this\u00a0 season,\u00a0 but\u00a0 the\u00a0 track\u00a0 organizers\u00a0 have\u00a0 not\u00a0 met\u00a0 their\u00a0 contractual\u00a0 obligations,\u00a0 and therefore,\u00a0 we\u00a0 cannot\u00a0 go\u00a0 back\u00a0 to\u00a0 Portugal\u00a0 this\u00a0 year.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is\u00a0 a\u00a0 shame\u00a0 because\u00a0 I\u00a0 believe\u00a0 that\u00a0 GP2 produced some great race action on that track last September, and we would have loved to have Portimao on our calendar again this season.}",

Dutch driver Renger van der Zande put his early stamp on the Series by dominating almost from beginning to end in today\u2019s opening free practice session at Circuit de Catalunya. The RSC Mucke Motorsport driver posted a time of 1:38.664 and finished just ahead of team mate Nigel Melker, an impressive showing from the Ralf Schumacher led race team. It certainly wasn\u2019t plain sailing for the Dutch driver. With Gutierrez hot on his heels and just six minutes remaining, van der Zande was shown a black and orange flag for a broken mirror he picked up earlier in the session. But, despite a last-gasp effort from Gutierrez, the Mexican was unable to match the flying Dutchman and had to settle for third. With fresh rubber on his Status GP car Robert Wickens moved towards the top of the time sheets and finished the session in fourth spot posting a time of 1:38.974. Four tenths of a second behind Wickens was Manor Racing driver James Jakes, followed by his teammate and GP3 newcomer Adrian Quaife-Hobbs. Despite ending his session prematurely deep in the gravel after just five laps, Addax Team driver Mirko Bortolotti managed to finish the session in seventh",
