However, that doesn\u2019t seem reason enough for the policy authority to lift its backstop on the critical pairing. Governing Council member Fritz Zurbruegg remarked this past session that the barrier is especially necessary considering the stability of the Euro-region is once again at risk. Speaking to regional bankers\u2019 group, Zurbruegg also made note that the SNB\u2019s reserve levels are a result of FX exposure accumulated through monetary policy. Furthermore, he noted that the central bank couldn\u2019t hedge itself of these risks and volatility via the euro or dollar was felt immediately by the group. This may be obvious, but it breaks from the unflappable confidence we expect from central bankers. Is that recognition of the possibility of failure?, 99651=22:45, 70468=When Bank of England Governor Mervyn King testified before the Treasury Committee for the last time as the leader of the central bank, he said something sterling traders consider. In a humorous quip, King suggested that while his replacement may be more persuasive than he is; Marc Carney would not likely gain more traction than his predecessor. Each person has one vote under the current regime at the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC); and King has been outvoted in his call for stimulus in the past three policy meetings 3 to 6. The market would do well to remember that Carney can only accomplish so much in his new position without the support of the Committee. Speculation that the BoE will materially upgrade its stimulus efforts to match that of the BoJ, Fed or even ECB has added material weight to the pound. We will see if this reality clears up slowly or all at once on July 4 when Carney casts his first vote. Meanwhile, we should read through the details on the upcoming BoE Financial Stability report.
