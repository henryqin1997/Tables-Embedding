I go to school at various times of the evening and school saftey drives around often. Most people are going about their own business. I am very petite and I feel completely safe at Middlesex County College. Great for these types of students It is great for all students; Non-traditional and traditional alike; with various ethnicities you will never feel left out. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus none Bang for the buck I personally use all the school has to offer. When I have to print out my paper, I bring my flash drive to their center and print out my documents. I use their computers and libraries when on campus instead of going to my local library. I go to tutoring anytime I need",
