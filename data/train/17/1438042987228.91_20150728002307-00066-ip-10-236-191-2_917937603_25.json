The proposal would restructure NCUA's PCA regulations and make various revisions, including amending the agency's current risk-based net worth requirement by replacing the current risk-based net worth ratio with a new risk-based capital ratio for federally insured natural person credit unions (credit unions). The proposal would also, in response to public comments received, make a number of changes to the original proposed rule that the Board published in the Federal Register on February 27, 2014. These changes include, among other things, exempting credit unions with up to $100 million in total assets from the new rule, lowering the risk-based capital ratio level required for an affected credit union to be classified as well capitalized from 10.5 percent to 10 percent, lowering the risk weights for various classes of assets, removing interest rate risk components from the risk weights, and extending the implementation timeframe to January 1, 2019. These changes would substantially reduce the number of credit unions subject to the rule, reduce the impact on affected credit unions, and afford affected credit unions sufficient time to prepare for the rule's implementation. The proposed risk-based capital requirement set forth in this proposal would be more consistent with NCUA's risk-based capital measure for corporate credit unions and more comparable to the regulatory risk-based capital measures used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and Office of the Comptroller of Currency (Other Banking Agencies). In addition, the proposed revisions would amend the risk weights for many of NCUA's current asset classifications; require higher minimum levels of capital for credit unions with concentrations of assets in real estate loans or commercial loans or higher levels of non-current loans; and set forth how NCUA can address a credit union that does not hold capital that is commensurate with its risk. The proposed revisions would also eliminate several provisions in NCUA's current PCA regulations, including provisions relating to the regular reserve account, risk-mitigation credits, and alternative risk weights. (For clarity, the \u201ccurrent\u201d PCA regulations would remain in force until the effective date of a final risk-based capital rule.), 67573=\u00a7 1784 - Examination of insured credit unions, 68818=\u00a7 1606 - Determination of annual percentage rate, 68624=\u00a7 1604 - Disclosure guidelines, 69413=\u00a7 1612 - Effect on government agencies, 68928=\u00a7 1607 - Administrative enforcement, 66616=\u00a7 1756 - Reports and examinations, 68716=\u00a7 1605 - Determination of finance charge, 69199=\u00a7 1610 - Effect on other laws, 67955=\u00a7 1789 - Administrative provisions, 25643=On June 20, 2013, the NCUA Board (Board) approved, with a 30-day effective date, a final rule titled Loan Participations; Purchase, Sale and Pledge of Eligible Obligations; Purchase of Assets and Assumption of Liabilities, effective July 25, 2013. The Board extends the effective date for the final rule to September 23, 2013, to provide federally insured credit unions with additional time to prepare to comply with the final rule., 67680=\u00a7 1786 - Termination of insured credit union status; cease and desist orders; removal or suspension from office; procedure, 67470=\u00a7 1782 - Administration of insurance fund, 69119=\u00a7 1609 - Repealed., 34175=The NCUA Board (Board) is making a number of technical amendments to NCUA's regulations based on issues identified by staff and through NCUA's rolling, three-year regulatory review process. In addition, the Board is making a number of nomenclature changes to NCUA's regulations to reflect changes to NCUA's office structure, including the transfer of duties and the creation of the new Office of National Examinations and Supervision (ONES). Finally, under title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 1 (Dodd-Frank Act), rulemaking authority for a number of consumer financial protection laws were transferred from various federal regulatory agencies, including NCUA, to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). As a result, the Board is now updating certain cross citations within its regulations and rescinding NCUA's rules governing the \u201cPrivacy of Consumer Financial Information\u201d under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 2 and the \u201cRegistration of Residential Mortgage Loan Originators\u201d under the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, 3 which were transferred to the CFPB. 1 Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1955-2113 (2010). 2 12 U.S.C. 6801 et seq. 3 12 U.S.C. 5101 et seq., 72144=Title 12 published on 2015-01-01, 67226=\u00a7 1766 - Powers of Board, 69700=\u00a7 1615 - Prohibition on use of \u201cRule of 78\u2019s\u201d in connection with mortgage refinancings and other consumer loans, 69025=\u00a7 1608 - Views of other agencies, 66788=\u00a7 1758 - Bylaws, 66459=\u00a7 1752 - Definitions, 68304=\u00a7 1601 - Congressional findings and declaration of purpose, 66865=\u00a7 1759 - Membership, 68424=\u00a7 1602 - Definitions and rules of construction, 69513=\u00a7 1613 - Annual reports to Congress by Bureau, 85662=The NCUA Board (Board) is issuing for public comment this proposed rule (2015 proposal) to amend its regulation governing federal credit union (FCU) ownership of fixed assets. To provide regulatory relief to FCUs, the 2015 proposal eliminates a provision in the current fixed assets rule that established a five percent aggregate limit on investments in fixed assets for FCUs with $1,000,000 or more in assets. It also eliminates the provisions in the current fixed assets rule relating to waivers from the aggregate limit. Further, instead of applying the prescriptive aggregate limit provided by regulation in the current fixed assets rule, the Board proposes to oversee FCU ownership of fixed assets through the supervisory process and guidance. The 2015 proposal also makes conforming amendments to the scope and definitions sections of the current fixed assets rule to reflect this proposed approach, and it amends the title of \u00a7 701.36 to more accurately reflect this amended scope and applicability. In addition, the 2015 proposal simplifies the fixed assets rule's partial occupancy requirements for FCU premises acquired for future expansion by establishing a single six-year time period for partial occupancy of such premises and by removing the 30-month requirement for partial occupancy waiver requests. The Board notes that, in July 2014, it issued a proposal regarding the fixed assets rule that addressed, among other things, the partial occupancy provisions of the fixed assets rule (July 2014 proposal), but NCUA did not finalize that proposal. For reasons discussed below, the 2015 proposal incorporates similar partial occupancy proposed amendments from the July 2014 proposal, with one modification to the time period for partial occupancy.}",

    "textAfterTable": "NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION Final rule. This rule is effective July 6, 2015. 12 CFR Part 701 Summary The NCUA Board (Board) is issuing a final regulation to amend the associational common bond provisions of NCUA's chartering and field of membership requirements. Specifically, the amendments establish a threshold requirement which provides that, in order for an association to qualify to be part of a federal credit union's (FCU) field of membership (FOM), the association must not have been formed primarily for the purpose of expanding credit union membership. The amendments also expand the criteria in NCUA's current totality of the circumstances test, which is a regulatory tool used to determine if an association, after satisfying the above-referenced threshold requirement, also satisfies the associational common bond requirements necessary to qualify for inclusion in an FCU's FOM. The amendments will better ensure that FCUs comply with established membership requirements. Additionally, NCUA is granting automatic membership qualification under the associational common bond requirements to certain categories of associations that NCUA has routinely approved for FCU membership in the past. For ease of reading, NCUA uses the terms \u201cassociation\u201d and \u201cgroup\u201d interchangeably in this rulemaking. 2014-12-19; vol. 79 # 244 - Friday, December 19, 2014",
