Direct drive refers to motion created by the direct application of electromagnetic drive force, rather than through a belt, ball screw, or some other intermediate drive. Of course, servomotors have been used Motion Reference Guide: Software Keeps Linear-Stage Integration Straight , and discrete components, and both rotary or linear-motor types. Machine builders can now employ a single common-control platform that can deploy the software developed for one application across a variety of controllers within the platform family. These desktop applications do not develop overnight Motion Reference Guide: Software Keeps Linear-Stage Integration Straight actuators combine all aspects of linear motion in a single piece of hardware. Software selects type of linear actuator based on application and performance parameters. Designers no longer need concern themselves with connectivity between diverse components. Software integration presented additional Programming Multiple ECAM profiles on Accelera-series Controllers (.pdf) The ECAM mode of motion mimics the behavior of a mechanical cam by driving a slave axis, along a predetermined profile, based on the position of a master axis. ECAM is well suited for applications",
