Data from 1996 and 1997 in Georgia were used for accident related variables; Other variables used, such as roadway geometrics and traffic volumes, were based on the 1997 road characteristic files maintained by the Georgia Department of Transportation and on data collected in the field during the summer of 2001. Recall that for Georgia data, two sets of accidents were extracted-those within 0.08 km (0.05 miles) of the intersection and those within 0.06 km (0.04 miles).}",
