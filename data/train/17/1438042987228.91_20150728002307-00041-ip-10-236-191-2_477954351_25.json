J. Falbe, M. Regitz), 10th edition, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, (1997), page 1764. Nonionogenic emulsifiers with a HLB value of 10\u201315 may be particularly preferred according to the invention., 104692=The term \u201ccoloring operation\u201d covers here all methods known to the person skilled in the art in which a colorant is applied to, optionally dampened, hair, and is either left on the hair for a period of between a few minutes and about 45 minutes and then rinsed out with water or a surfactant-containing composition, or is left on the hair altogether. In this connection, reference is made expressly to the known monographs, e.g. Kh. Schrader, Grundlagen und Rezepturen der Kosmetika [Principles and formulations of cosmetics], 2nd edition, H\ufffdthig Buch Verlag, Heidelberg, 1989, which report the corresponding knowledge of the person skilled in the art., 122322=With regard to the dyes which can be used in the hair colorants and tints according to the invention, reference is also made expressly to the monograph by Ch. Zviak, The Science of Hair Care, chapter 7 (pages 248\u2013250; direct dyes), and chapter 8, pages 264\u2013267; oxidation dye precursors), published as volume 7 of the series \u201cDermatology\u201d (Ed. Ch., Culnan and H. Maibach), Verlag Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, Basle, 1986, and the \u201cEuropean Inventory of Cosmetic Raw Materials\u201d, published by the European Commission, available in diskette format from the Bundesverband Deutscher Industrie- und Handelsunternehmen f\ufffdr Arzneimittel, Reformwaren und K\ufffdrperpflegemittel e.V., Mannheim., 31995=This application is a continuation under 35 U.S.C.\ufffd 365(c) and \ufffd120 of International Application No. PCT/EP01/04375 filed Apr. 18, 2001 and under \ufffd 119 of German Patent Application No. 100 20 887.8 filed Apr. 28, 2000., 102995=The extractants used for the preparation of said plant extracts may be water, alcohols and mixtures thereof. Of the alcohols, preference is given in this connection to lower alcohols, such as ethanol and isopropanol, but in particular polyhydric alcohols, such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, both as a sole extractant and also in a mixture with water. Plant extracts based on water/propylene glycol in the ratio 1:10 to 10:1 have proven particularly suitable., 58971=As cationic polymers, it is likewise possible to use the polymers known under the names Polyquaternium-24 (commercial product e.g. Quatrisoft\ufffd LM 200). According to the invention, it is likewise possible to use the copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone, as are available as commercial products Copolymer 845 (manufacturer: ISP), Gaffix\ufffd VC 713 (manufacturer: ISP), Gafquat\ufffd ASCP 1011, Gafquat\ufffdHS 110, Luviquat\ufffd 8155 and Luviquat\ufffd MS 370., 131745=The hair-coloring cream bases having the compositions listed in the table below were prepared. The constituents were mixed together in the order given. The oxidative development of the coloration was carried out in a mixing in the ratio 5:4 with 5% strength hydrogen peroxide dispersion. The contact time on the hair from Kerling, type \u201cnatural white\u201d, was 30 minutes at 25\ufffd C. When the coloring process was complete, the hair was rinsed and washed with an aqueous solution consisting of 1.0% by weight of Texapon\ufffd NSO, pH\u20146\u20137, and then dried. Each hair tress was measured at eight points using a color-measuring system from Datacolor. For this, the sample to be measured was fixed in a mounting device on a spectrophotometer, the reflectance values were measured over the range of visible light from 390\u2013700 nm at intervals of 10 nm and the results were processed by means of a computer. The computer program determined the standard color values according to the CIE system in accordance with DIN 5033. The standard with regard to color intensity and washfastness used was the composition distinguished in each case by \u201cC\u201d. For this, the color intensity of the washed tresses colored using these compositions was determined by colorimetry and set as 100%. The color intensities relative to this of the washed tresses colored using the other compositions are given in the table. The residual color strength of the hair tresses washed a further 6 times was determined relative to the hair tress washed once. These values are likewise given in the table., 60393=In addition, cationized protein hydrolyzates are also a type of cationic polymer, where the parent protein hydrolyzate can originate from animal, for example from collagen, milk or keratin, from plant, for example from wheat, corn, rice, potatoes, soybean or almonds, from marine life forms, for example from fish collagen or algae, or protein hydrolyzates obtained by biotechnological methods. The protein hydrolyzates forming the basis of the cationic derivatives according to the invention can be obtained from the corresponding proteins by a chemical, in particular alkaline or acidic, hydrolysis, by an enzymatic hydrolysis and/or a combination of the two types of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of proteins usually gives a protein hydrolyzate with a molecular weight distribution of about 100 daltons up to several thousand daltons. Preference is given to those cationic protein hydrolyzates whose parent protein content has a molecular weight of from 100 up to 25 000 daltons, preferably 250 to 5000 daltons. In addition, cationic protein hydrolyzates are understood as meaning quaternized amino acids and mixtures thereof. Quaternization of the protein hydrolyzates or of the amino acids is often carried out using quaternary ammonium salts, such as, for example, N,N-dimethyl-N-(n-alkyl)-N-(2-hydroxy-3-chloro-n-propyl)ammonium halides. In addition, the cationic protein hydrolyzates can also be derivatized yet further. Typical examples of the cationic protein hydrolyzates and derivatives according to the invention which may be mentioned are the products given under the INCI names in the \u201cInternational Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook\u201d, (seventh edition 1997, The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association 1101 17th Street, N.W., Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20036-4702) and commercially available: Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Casein, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Hair Keratin, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Silk, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Silk Amino Acids, Hydroxypropyl Arginine Lauryl/Myristyl Ether HCl, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Gelatin, Hydroxypropyl-trimonium Hydrolyzed Casein, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Conchiolin Protein, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed keratin, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Rice Bran Protein, Hydroxyproypltrimonium Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydroxy-propyl Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxypropyl-trimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein/Siloxysilicate, Laurdimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Laurdimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Laurdimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein/Siloxysilicate, Lauryldimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Casein, Lauryldimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Lauryldimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin, Lauryldimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Silk, Lauryldimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Steardimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Casein, Steardimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Steardimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin, Steardimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Steardimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Silk, Steardimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Steardimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Steardimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Steartrimonium Hydroxyethyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Quaternium-76 Hydrolyzed Collagen, Quaternium-79 Hydrolyzed Collagen, Quaternium-79 Hydrolyzed Keratin, Quaternium-79 Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Quaternium-79 Hydrolyzed Silk, Quaternium-79 Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Quaternium-79 Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein.}",
