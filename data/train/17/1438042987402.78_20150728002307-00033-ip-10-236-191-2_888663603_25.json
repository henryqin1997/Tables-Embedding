            "The surrounding area is very sketchy. There is many safety features though. You can sign up for texts about dangerous situations as well as school cancellations from the campus police. You can always ask for a police escort for no cost if you feel in danger at any time.",
            "I am apart of Greek Life on Campus. I love it. However there is not Greek Housing which is a little disappointing. There are great sorority's and fraternities on campus.",
            "There are not very many clubs but its easy to create a club if there is not enough interest.",
            "This school is great for only Criminal Justice and Forensic Science students.",
            "Jazzman's coffee shop is very popular on campus and has some good food.",
            "The school is very expensive with very little financial aid. The housing situation is horrible.",
            "Clubbing is very popular at UNH. People go to downtown New Haven in order to find things to do. Otherwise there isn't much unless you are apart for the Greek Life.",
            "The food is pretty good for college food. Most people tend to avoid Bartel's food though.",
            "The dorms are very nice and easy to meet new people. You are only guaranteed housing for freshman year and the rest of the years its VERY VERY hard to get housing.",
            "The engineering classes are very hard and most you have to teach the material to yourself because the professors are horrible. You have to work hard to get the good teachers who know what they are doing.",
            "I would advise future students to look at other schools because there are many faults to UNH. The housing situation sucks unless you are a freshman. Many people in my year didn't get housing for their sophomore year and didn't get there money back.",
            "The campus and class sizes are very small. The students are great and there are some great teachers. The neighborhood is very poor and not the safest."

They changed an upperclassmen dorm to a freshmen dorm and fall 2014 they'll open up a new dorm with parking and a movie theater., 273808=The great thing about living in Europe is that the airfare is really cheap through RyanAir. During October break six of us went to Barcelona, Dublin, and Paris. It is also easy to hop on a train during the weekend and explore more of Italy. At Keller Platz they have nights where bands play and there is great music and dancing!}",

Login to rate or flag the reviews Nick from NJ 10/13/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 19 out of 19 people found this review useful. 3 of 94 Categories Comments Great for these types of students New Haven is a great school for people who live close to new haven and will commute or live on campus during the week and then leave on the weekends. It is even better for those who are fire science majors, criminal justice majors and forensic science majors. Everything else can be found at other universities that have better programs. Tips for prospective students Do not sweat the college application process. Getting into New Haven was very easy. Do well in your senior year of high school, be involved in school and out of school. Study but don't over study for the SAT and ACT and you will do fine. The college application process is overwhelming if you make it overwhelming. there is a school",
