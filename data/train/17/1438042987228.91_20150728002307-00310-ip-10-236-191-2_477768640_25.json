First a recombinant Protein-A column was equilibrated in 2 M urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5 and loaded with the filtered peptibody refold reaction. The column was then washed with 2 column volumes of equilibration buffer, followed by 2 column volumes of PBS. The peptibody fraction was eluted with 50 mM NaOAc, pH 3 and quickly neutralized by a 1:4 dilution into 10 mM NaOAc, 50 mM NaCl, pH 5. The diluted Protein-A eluate was again filtered and loaded to an SP Sepharose HP cation exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 10 mM NaOAc, 50 mM NaCl, pH 5. The peptibody fractions were then eluted with a linear 50-500 mM NaCl gradient, pooled and concentrated to about 2 mg/ml. The final pools of Fc-loop TN8-19-07 (#6951) and the carboxy-terminal Fc TN8-19-07 (#6826) were evaluated by RP-HPLC (FIG. 6) and SDS-PAGE (FIG. 7). Both RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE demonstrate that improved homogeneity in the final product is achieved with the Fc-loop TN8-19-07 (#6951) relative to the comparable carboxy-terminal fused peptibody (#6826).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{543052=The TPO-mimetic compounds of this invention may be used in any situation in which production of platelets or platelet precursor cells is desired, or in which stimulation of the c-Mpl receptor is desired. Thus, for example, the compounds of this invention may be used to treat any condition in a mammal wherein there is a need of platelets, megakaryocytes, and the like. Such conditions are described in detail in the following exemplary sources: WO95/26746; WO95/21919; WO95/18858; WO95/21920 and are incorporated herein., 49089=Other methods compete with phage display in peptide research. A peptide library can be fused to the carboxyl terminus of the lac repressor and expressed in E. coli. Another E. coli-based method allows display on the cell's outer membrane by fusion with a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL). Hereinafter, these and related methods are collectively referred to as \u201cE. coli display.\u201d Another biological approach to screening soluble peptide mixtures uses yeast for expression and secretion. See Smith et al. (1993), Mol. Pharmacol. 43: 741-8. Hereinafter, the method of Smith et al. and related methods are referred to as \u201cyeast-based screening.\u201d In another method, translation of random RNA is halted prior to ribosome release, resulting in a library of polypeptides with their associated RNA still attached. Hereinafter, this and related methods are collectively referred to as \u201cribosome display.\u201d Other methods employ chemical linkage of peptides to RNA; see, for example, Roberts & Szostak (1997), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94: 12297-303. Hereinafter, this and related methods are collectively referred to as \u201cRNA-peptide screening.\u201d Chemically derived peptide libraries have been developed in which peptides are immobilized on stable, non-biological materials, such as polyethylene rods or solvent-permeable resins. Another chemically derived peptide library uses photolithography to scan peptides immobilized on glass slides. Hereinafter, these and related methods are collectively referred to as \u201cchemical-peptide screening.\u201d Chemical-peptide screening may be advantageous in that it allows use of D-amino acids and other unnatural analogues, as well as non-peptide elements. Both biological and chemical methods are reviewed in Wells & Lowman (1992), Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 3: 355-62., 638392=Growth factors are serially diluted from 1000 ng/ml to 0.488 ng/ml in triplicate, in 100 \u03bcl of 10% FBS-Iscoves Modified Dulbelcco's medium (IMDM) across the 96 well plate. 15000 cells/well are added to the 96 well plate in 100 \u03bcl of 10% FBS IMDM. The total volume per well is 200 \u03bcl of media with 15000 cells per well. Cells and media alone are the zero control. Cells are incubated in a humidified chamber at 37\ufffd C., 181013=The term \u201cNGF-binding peptide\u201d comprises peptides that can be identified or derived as described in WO 04/026329, published Apr. 1, 2004 and any other reference in Table 2 identified as having subject matter related to NGF. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate that each of these references enables one to select different peptides than actually disclosed therein by following the disclosed procedures with different peptide libraries., 468395=The invention further embraces molecules covalently modified to include one or more water soluble polymer attachments, such as polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol, or polypropylene glycol, as described U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192; and 4,179,337. Still other useful polymers known in the art include monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose, or other carbohydrate based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, a polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol) and polyvinyl alcohol, as well as mixtures of these polymers. Particularly preferred are peptibodies covalently modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) subunits. Water-soluble polymers may be bonded at specific positions, for example at the amino terminus of the peptibodies, or randomly attached to one or more side chains of the polypeptide. The use of PEG for improving the therapeutic capacity for specific binding agents, e.g. peptibodies, and for humanized antibodies in particular, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,426 to Gonzales et al. issued Oct. 17, 2000., 573012=One may dilute or increase the volume of the compound of the invention with an inert material. These diluents could include carbohydrates, especially mannitol, \u03b1-lactose, anhydrous lactose, cellulose, sucrose, modified dextrans and starch. Certain inorganic salts may also be used as fillers including calcium triphosphate, magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride. Some commercially available diluents are Fast-Flo, Emdex, STA-Rx 1500, Emcompress and Avicell., 47542=Phage display peptide libraries have emerged as a powerful method in identifying such peptide agonists and antagonists. See, for example, Scott et al. (1990), Science 249: 386; Devlin et al. (1990), Science 249: 404; U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409, issued Jun. 29, 1993; U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,731, issued Mar. 31, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,530, issued Mar. 12, 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,018, issued Jul. 11, 1995; U.S. Pat. No. 5,338,665, issued Aug. 16, 1994; U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,545, issued Jul. 13, 1999; WO 96/40987, published Dec. 19, 1996; and WO 98/15833, published Apr. 16, 1998 (each of which is incorporated by reference). In such libraries, random peptide sequences are displayed by fusion with coat proteins of filamentous phage. Typically, the displayed peptides are affinity-eluted against an antibody-immobilized extracellular domain of a receptor. The retained phages may be enriched by successive rounds of affinity purification and repropagation. The best binding peptides may be sequenced to identify key residues within one or more structurally related families of peptides. See, e.g., Cwirla et al. (1997), Science 276: 1696-9, in which two distinct families were identified. The peptide sequences may also suggest which residues may be safely replaced by alanine scanning or by mutagenesis at the DNA level. Mutagenesis libraries may be created and screened to further optimize the sequence of the best binders. Lowman (1997), Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 26: 401-24., 583651=The dosage regimen involved in a method for treating the above-described conditions will be determined by the attending physician, considering various factors which modify the action of drugs, e.g. the age, condition, body weight, sex and diet of the patient, the severity of any infection, time of administration and other clinical factors. Generally, the daily regimen should be in the range of 0.1-1000 micrograms of the inventive compound per kilogram of body weight, preferably 0.1-150 micrograms per kilogram., 507570=Other exemplary algorithms, gap opening penalties, gap extension penalties, comparison matrices, thresholds of similarity, etc. may be used, including those set forth in the Program Manual, Wisconsin Package, Version 9, September, 1997. The particular choices to be made will be apparent to those of skill in the art and will depend on the specific comparison to be made, such as DNA-to-DNA, protein-to-protein, protein-to-DNA; and additionally, whether the comparison is between given pairs of sequences (in which case GAP or BestFit are generally preferred) or between one sequence and a large database of sequences (in which case FASTA or BLASTA are preferred)., 36789=This application is a continuation of U.S. Non-provisional application Ser. No. 11/234,731, filed Sep. 23, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,442,778 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/612,680, filed Sep. 24, 2004, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties., 181490=The term \u201cmyostatin-binding peptide\u201d comprises peptides that can be identified or derived as described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/742,379, filed Dec. 19, 2003 and any other reference in Table 2 identified as having subject matter related to myostatin. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate that each of these references enables one to select different peptides than actually disclosed therein by following the disclosed procedures with different peptide libraries., 178926=The term \u201c-antagonist peptide\u201d or \u201cinhibitor peptide\u201d refers to a peptide that blocks or in some way interferes with the biological activity of the associated protein of interest, or has biological activity comparable to a known antagonist or inhibitor of the associated protein of interest. Thus, the term \u201cTNF-antagonist peptide\u201d comprises peptides that can be identified or derived as described in Takasaki et al. (1997), Nature Biotech. 15: 1266-70 or any of the references in Table 2 identified as having TNF-antagonistic subject matter. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate that each of these references enables one to select different peptides than actually disclosed therein by following the disclosed procedures with different peptide libraries., 51884=Structural analysis of protein-protein interaction may also be used to suggest peptides that mimic the binding activity of large protein ligands. In such an analysis, the crystal structure may suggest the identity and relative orientation of critical residues of the large protein ligand, from which a peptide may be designed. See, e.g., Takasaki et al. (1997), Nature Biotech. 15: 1266-70. Hereinafter, these and related methods are referred to as \u201cprotein structural analysis.\u201d These analytical methods may also be used to investigate the interaction between a receptor protein and peptides selected by phage display, which may suggest further modification of the peptides to increase binding affinity., 469606=Various means for attaching chemical moieties useful as vehicles are currently available, see, e.g., Patent Cooperation Treaty (\u201cPCT\u201d) International Publication No. WO 96/11953, entitled \u201cN-Terminally Chemically Modified Protein Compositions and Methods,\u201d herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. This PCT publication discloses, among other things, the selective attachment of water soluble polymers to the N-terminus of proteins., 472671=An additional vehicle may also be a protein, polypeptide, peptide, antibody, antibody fragment, or small molecule (e.g., a peptidomimetic compound) capable of binding to a salvage receptor. For example, one could use as a vehicle a polypeptide as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, issued Apr. 14, 1998 to Presta et al. Peptides could also be selected by phage display for binding to the FcRn salvage receptor. Such salvage receptor-binding compounds are also included within the meaning of \u201cvehicle\u201d in this invention. Such vehicles should be selected for increased half-life (e.g., by avoiding sequences recognized by proteases) and decreased immunogenicity (e.g., by favoring non-immunogenic sequences, as discovered in antibody humanization)., 567720=The present invention also provides methods of using pharmaceutical compositions of the inventive compounds. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be for administration for injection, or for oral, pulmonary, nasal, transdermal or other forms of administration. In general, the invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising effective amounts of a compound of the invention together with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers. Such compositions include diluents of various buffer content (e.g., Tris-HCl, acetate, phosphate), pH and ionic strength; additives such as detergents and solubilizing agents (e.g., Tween 80, Polysorbate 80), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite), preservatives (e.g., Thimersol, benzyl alcohol) and bulking substances (e.g., lactose, mannitol); incorporation of the material into particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, etc. or into liposomes. Hyaluronic acid may also be used, and this may have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. Such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the present proteins and derivatives. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 18042) pages 1435-1712 which are herein incorporated by reference. The compositions may be prepared in liquid form, or may be in dried powder, such as lyophilized form. Implantable sustained release formulations are also contemplated, as are transdermal formulations., 463619=As noted above, both native Fc's and Fc variants are suitable Fc domains for use within the scope of this invention. A native Fc may be extensively modified to form an Fc variant in accordance with this invention, provided binding to the salvage receptor is maintained; see, for example WO 97/34631 and WO 96/32478. In such Fc variants, one may remove one or more sites of a native Fc that provide structural features or functional activity not required by the fusion molecules of this invention. One may remove these sites by, for example, substituting or deleting residues, inserting residues into the site, or truncating portions containing the site. The inserted or substituted residues may also be altered amino acids, such as peptidomimetics or D-amino acids. Fc variants may be desirable for a number of reasons, several of which are described below. Exemplary Fc variants include molecules and sequences in which:, 629350=This molecule was prepared as described above in example 2 and in U.S. Ser. No. 10/742,379, filed Dec. 19, 2003 (also PCT/US03/40781, filed Dec. 19, 2003), which is hereby incorporated by reference., 179729=The term \u201cTPO-mimetic peptide\u201d comprises peptides that can be identified or derived as described in Cwirla et al.

Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate that each of these references enables one to select different peptides than actually disclosed therein by following the disclosed procedures with different peptide libraries., 628652=This molecule was prepared as described above in Example 1 and in U.S. Pat. App. No. 2003/0236192 (also PCT/US04/10989), which is hereby incorporated by reference., 222602=Exemplary peptides for this invention appear in Tables 4 through 20 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Additional preferred peptides appear in U.S. 2003/0229023, published Dec. 11, 2003; WO 03/057134, published Jul. 17, 2003; U.S. 2003/0236193, published Dec. 25, 2003; WO 00/24770, published May 4, 2000; U.S. 2003/0176352, published Sep. 18, 2003; WO 03/031589, published Apr. 17, 2003; U.S. Ser.

No. 10/742,379, filed Dec. 19, 2003; PCT/US03/40781, filed Dec. 19, 2003, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Such peptides may be prepared by methods disclosed in the art., 578214=Also contemplated herein is pulmonary delivery of the present protein (or derivatives thereof). The protein (or derivative) is delivered to the lungs of a mammal while inhaling and traverses across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream. (Other reports of this include Adjei et al., Pharma. Res. (1990) 7: 565-9; Adjei et al. (1990), Internatl. J. Pharmaceutics 63: 135-44 (leuprolide acetate); Braquet et al. (1989), J. Cardiovasc.

No. 5,284,656 (granulocyte colony stimulating factor)., 172504=The term \u201cFc variant\u201d refers to a molecule or sequence that is modified from a native Fc but still comprises a binding site for the salvage receptor, FcRn. International applications WO 97/34631 (published 25 Sep. 1997) and WO 96/32478 describe exemplary Fc variants, as well as interaction with the salvage receptor, and are hereby incorporated by reference. Thus, the term \u201cFc variant\u201d comprises a molecule or sequence that is humanized from a non-human native Fc. Furthermore, a native Fc comprises sites that may be removed because they provide structural features or biological activity that are not required for the fusion molecules of the present invention. Thus, the term \u201cFc variant\u201d comprises a molecule or sequence that lacks one or more native Fc sites or residues that affect or are involved in (1) disulfide bond formation, (2) incompatibility with a selected host cell (3) N-terminal heterogeneity upon expression in a selected host cell, (4) glycosylation, (5) interaction with complement, (6) binding to an Fc receptor other than a salvage receptor, or (7) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Fc variants are described in further detail hereinafter., 180428=The term \u201cang-2-binding peptide\u201d comprises peptides that can be identified or derived as described in U.S. Pat. App. No. 2003/0229023, published Dec. 11, 2003; WO 03/057134, published Jul. 17, 2003; U.S. 2003/0236193, published Dec. 25, 2003; and any other reference in Table 2 identified as having subject matter related to ang-2.

Stockton Press, New York (1991); and Carillo et al., SIAM J. Applied Math., 48:1073 (1988)., 561907=The compounds of this invention can also be used to treat inflammatory conditions of the joints. Inflammatory conditions of a joint are chronic joint diseases that afflict and disable, to varying degrees, millions of people worldwide. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease of articular joints in which the cartilage and bone are slowly eroded away by a proliferative, invasive connective tissue called pannus, which is derived from the synovial membrane. The disease may involve peri-articular structures such as bursae, tendon sheaths and tendons as well as extra-articular tissues such as the subcutis, cardiovascular system, lungs, spleen, lymph nodes, skeletal muscles, nervous system (central and peripheral) and eyes (Silberberg (1985), Anderson's Pathology, Kissane (ed.), II:1828). Osteoarthritis is a common joint disease characterized by degenerative changes in articular cartilage and reactive proliferation of bone and cartilage around the joint. Osteoarthritis is a cell-mediated active process that may result from the inappropriate response of chondrocytes to catabolic and anabolic stimuli. Changes in some matrix molecules of articular cartilage reportedly occur in early osteoarthritis (Thonar et al. (1993), Rheumatic disease clinics of North America, Moskowitz (ed.), 19:635-657 and Shinmei et al. (1992), Arthritis Rheum., 35:1304-1308). TALL-1, TALL-1R and modulators thereof are believed to be useful in the treatment of these and related conditions., 629000=This molecule was prepared as described in U.S. 2003/0236193, published Dec. 25, 2003 (also PCT/US04/10989, filed Apr. 8, 2004), which is hereby incorporated by reference., 651146=Using optimized refold conditions, the denatured and reduced Fc-Loop TN8-19-7 constructs were refolded from the solubilized inclusion body fractions by a 1:25 (v/v) dilution into 4 M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.16 M Arg-HCl, 20% glycerol, 3 M Cystine, 5 mM Cystamine pH 8.5. The solubilized peptibodies were added drop-wise to the refold buffer at 4\ufffd C. with stirring. The refold reactions were allowed to stir for 72 hours, and subsequently purified chromatographically. Final purification was achieved by a 2-column chromatographic process, as described in Example 2., 471744=Polysaccharide polymers are another type of water soluble polymer which may be used for protein modification. Dextrans are polysaccharide polymers comprised of individual subunits of glucose predominantly linked by \u03b11-6 linkages. The dextran itself is available in many molecular weight ranges, and is readily available in molecular weights from about 1 kD to about 70 kD. Dextran is a suitable water soluble polymer for use in the present invention as a vehicle by itself or in combination with another vehicle (e.g., Fc). See, for example, WO 96/11953 and WO 96/05309. The use of dextran conjugated to therapeutic or diagnostic immunoglobulins has been reported; see, for example, European Patent Publication No. 0 315 456, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Dextran of about 1 kD to about 20 kD is preferred when dextran is used as a vehicle in accordance with the present invention., 621832=In another embodiment of this invention, a novel, disulphide-constrained peptide TN8-19-7 (U.S. Pat App 2004-0181033-A1, which is incorporated by reference) of the sequence:, 141326=A more recent development is fusion of randomly generated peptides with the Fc domain. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843, issued Dec. 9, 2003 to Feige et al. (incorporated by reference in its entirety). Such molecules have come to be known as \u201cpeptibodies.\u201d They include one or more peptides linked to the N-terminus, C-terminus, amino acid sidechains, or to more than one of these sites. Peptibody technology enables design of therapeutic agents that incorporate peptides that target one or more ligands or receptors, tumor-homing peptides, membrane-transporting peptides, and the like. Peptibody technology has proven useful in design of a number of such molecules, including linear and disulfide-constrained peptides, \u201ctandem peptide multimers\u201d (i.e., more than one peptide on a single chain of an Fc domain). See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843; U.S. Pat. App. No. 2003/0195156, published Oct. 16, 2003 (corresponding to WO 02/092620, published Nov. 21, 2002); U.S. Pat. App. No. 2003/0176352, published Sep. 18, 2003 (corresponding to WO 03/031589, published Apr. 17, 2003); U.S. Ser. No. 09/422,838, filed Oct. 22, 1999 (corresponding to WO 00/24770, published May 4, 2000); U.S. Pat. App. No. 2003/0229023, published Dec. 11, 2003; WO 03/057134, published Jul. 17, 2003; U.S. Pat. App. No. 2003/0236193, published Dec. 25, 2003 (corresponding to PCT/US04/010989, filed Apr. 8, 2004); U.S. Ser. No. 10/666,480, filed Sep. 18, 2003 (corresponding to WO 04/026329, published Apr. 1, 2004), each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The art would benefit from further technology enabling such rational design of polypeptide therapeutic agents.}",
