The following summer he made his County Championship debut against Hampshire but it took until 2010 for a consistent run in the side. He took 16 wickets at 30.50 that season but hardly featured in the second half of the season. He was back in the side at the start of 2011 but could only take seven wickets at 62.00 and was dropped. 2012 saw him consigned to the second XI and he didn't have his contract renewed at Edgbaston., 51596=Andrew Miller has played cricket for Longridge since the age of seven, and first represented Lancashire aged 13. A right-arm seam bowler, he came through the Old Trafford Academy and was picked for the England Under-19 tour of India in 2005, playing three Youth Tests and four of the five Youth ODIs. He played a full part in the home series with India that summer and toured Bangladesh before playing in the 2006 Under-19 World Cup., 52777=Prior to the 2013 season, he was taken on a trial by Sussex and impressed on their pre-season tours to Port Elizabeth and Dubai, earning a contract for the summer.
