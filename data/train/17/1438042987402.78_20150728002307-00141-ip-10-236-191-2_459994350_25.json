Two ring buffers 652 and 654 are maintained\u2014one for the short term average and one for the long term average. Ring buffers are used so that power sample averaging can be accomplished over a sliding window in time. In a ring buffer, as a new sampled is added to the buffer, the oldest sample is removed. In the wireless networking example previously described, the short term average ring buffer stores the most recent 16 samples, and the long term average ring buffer stores on the order of 1024 or 2048 samples. Of course these sample sizes will vary depending on the application. It may also be reasonable to use an accumulator-based average for the long term average, but such an approach could be subject to buffer overflow.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention is described through the above exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that modification to and variation of the illustrated embodiments may be made without departing from the inventive concepts herein disclosed. Moreover, while the preferred embodiments are described in connection with various illustrative program command structures, one skilled in the art will recognize that the system may be embodied using a variety of specific command structures. Accordingly, the invention should not be viewed as limited except by the scope and spirit of the appended claims. Those skilled in the art should readily appreciate that programs defining the functions of the present invention can be delivered to a computer in many forms; including, but not limited to: (a) information permanently stored on non-writable storage media (e.g. read only memory devices within a computer such as ROM or CD-ROM disks readable by a computer I/O attachment); or (b) information alterably stored on writable storage media (e.g. floppy disks and hard drives). It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be loaded onto a computer, embedded device microprocessor (such as that found in an AP or STA), or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions which",
