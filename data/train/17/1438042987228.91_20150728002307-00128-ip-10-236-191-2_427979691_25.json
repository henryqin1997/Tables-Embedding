            "Description",
            "VEHICLE SEAT - A seat back has a seat back frame, a plane spring structure, and a headrest provided at the upper end of a seat back frame. The plane spring structure has left and right side wires, and horizontal wires extending in the horizontal direction. Connection wires are provided between the seat back frame and plane spring structure. First end portions and second end portions of the connection wires function as detachable portions. At least one of these detachable portions is detached from the seat back frame or plane spring structure by the load applied to the seat back, when a vehicle is bumped from behind.",
            "VEHICLE SEAT - A vehicle seat comprises: a vehicle body side member; a seat cushion having left and right side frames; left and right front links provided respectively between front end sides of the left and right side frames and the vehicle body side member, the left and right front links configure a portion of a lifter mechanism that moves the seat cushion, and one end side of the respective left and right front links is coupled to the vehicle body side member so as to be rotatable about an axis along the seat left-right direction; and a coupling member coupling together front end sides of the left and right side frames along the seat left-right direction, that is rotatable with respect to the left and right side frames about an axis along the seat left-right direction, and that is joined to other end side of the respective left and right front links.",
            "HEADREST DEVICE - A headrest device comprising: a headrest stay that is coupled to an upper end portion of a seatback of a vehicle seat, and that supports a headrest pad; an internal structure that is embedded inside the headrest pad, that is supported from a rear by the headrest stay, and that supports a head of an occupant from the rear during a vehicle rear-on collision via a support face that is formed at a front face of the internal structure; and a forward projection portion that is configured by a portion of the headrest stay that projects forward, that is disposed at an upper side or a lower side of the support face within the headrest pad, and that suppresses the head supported by the support face from tilting backward or tilting forward by pivoting about the support face as a pivoting center.",

            "VEHICLE SEAT - In a seat device, a stay including grommets is set with bending rigidity towards the vehicle front lower than the bending rigidity towards the vehicle rear. Moreover, there is a large displacement of the headrest towards the vehicle front since the stay including the grommets has a lower bending rigidity towards the vehicle front than the bending rigidity towards the vehicle rear. The headrest can be promptly displaced towards the side of the head of the occupant due to setting the bending rigidity of the stay including the grommets, thereby enabling the time until the headrest contacts the head of the occupant to be shortened with a simple configuration.",

The processor receives power from a battery to operate at a high clock frequency HFM(f) or a low clock frequency LFM(f). An allowable current Im is set for the discharge current of the battery. The time during which the processor operates at the HFM(f) and the time during which the processor operates at the LFM(f) are controlled by PWM. As the feedback current Ifb increases, the time during which the processor operates at the LFM(f) become longer than the time during which the processor operates at the HFM(f). 09-05-2013 Nozomu Nakanishi, Yokohama JP Patent application number Description Published 20090221851 PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE AMINOPHOSPHINYLBUTANOIC ACIDS - The present invention is a process for producing optically active aminophosphinylbutanoic acids represented by the formula (2) 09-03-2009 Nozomu Nakanishi, Kanagawa-Ken JP Patent application number Description Published 20110118468",
