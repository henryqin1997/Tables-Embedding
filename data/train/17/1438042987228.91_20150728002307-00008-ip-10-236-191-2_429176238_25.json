            "APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR FOREGROUND DETECTION - An apparatus and a method for fast foreground detection are provided. A foreground characteristic value calculation module calculates a foreground characteristic value by using an image intensity of each pixel in a target image and a background intensity of a corresponding pixel in a background model. A first filter determines a first threshold and a second threshold according to at least one scenic factor for capturing the target image and filters out non-foreground pixels having their foreground characteristic value between the first threshold and the second threshold from pixels in the target image. A second filter determines an image difference condition and a chroma similarity condition according to the scenic factor and filters out non-foreground pixels having their foreground characteristic value satisfying the image difference condition and the chroma similarity condition from pixels left by the first filter. Pixels left by the second filter are served as foreground pixels.",
            "METHOD OF DEFINING IMAGE SURVEILLANCE REGION - A method for defining a monitoring area for an image is provided, applicable to an image-based surveillance system, including the steps of: automatically generating a closed polygon on an image; determining whether the closed polygon requiring adjustment, if so, receiving an adjustment command from the user and performing corresponding adjustment . The adjustment commands include at least a move polygon command to move the entire polygon and a move vertex command to move a vertex of the polygon."

When said mirror is positioned on the optical axis, the image analysis device is suitable for receiving the image transmitted by the",
    "textAfterTable": "Kung-Ming Lan, Yilan TW Patent application number Description Published 20120154581 CASCADABLE CAMERA TAMPERING DETECTION TRANSCEIVER MODULE - A cascadable camera tampering detection transceiver module has a processing unit and a storing unit, an information controlling module and an analyzing module. The storing unit stores a transceiving module. The detection module analyzes input video, detects camera tampering events, synthesizes the input video with the image of camera tampering result, and outputs the synthesized video. When the input video is an output from the detection module, the detection module separates the camera tampering result from the input video, and the result can be used to simplify or enhance the subsequent video analysis. Performing the existing analysis repeatedly may be avoided, and the user may re-define the detection conditions in this manner. When the camera tampering result is transmitted in the video channel, the detection module transmits the camera tampering result, and hence the detection module may be used in combination with surveillance devices having image output or input interfaces. 06-21-2012 Kuo-Hua Lan, New Taipei City TW Patent application number Description Published 20140340592 TOUCH PANEL AND METHOD OF FABRICATING THE SAME - A touch panel includes a substrate, a first patterned conductive layer, a patterned passivation layer, and a second patterned conductive layer.
