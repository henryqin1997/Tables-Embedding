It rises behind the little township of Clunes (voting population 7, and one of them is a boarder-collie), like a patient observer, unfazed by the shrieks of granite loving climbers.

Essentially, you'll want \"Mountain Creek Road\" about 3kms down \"Fentons\" road. (See approach map for details). Once there, however, you'll be rewarded with a picturesque little mountain, suitable for a family picnic or bush walking destination, as much as it is home to Ballarat's climbing population.\u00a0 Notes On Bolting Power drills are banned and things like excessive cleaning and fixed hangers are unwelcome. All new bolting has to adhere to an established policy. (See VCC guide for details).
