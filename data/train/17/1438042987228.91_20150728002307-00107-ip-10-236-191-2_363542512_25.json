Also, having two different spanning-tree modes on Virtual Port Channel (vPC) peer switches is an inconsistency, so this operation is disruptive. Caution You must enable MST; Rapid PVST+ is the default. Enabling MST To leave the MST configuration mode and commit all the changes that you made before you left the mode, enter the exit command. To leave the MST configuration mode without committing any changes, enter the abort command. The pending region configuration starts with the current region configuration. Each command reference line creates its pending regional configuration. When you are in the MST configuration mode, the following guidelines apply: When you work with private VLANs, enter the private-vlan synchronize command to map the secondary VLANs to the same MST instance as the primary VLAN.",

Entering MST Configuration Mode You enter MST configuration mode to configure the MST name, VLAN-to-instance mapping, and MST revision number on the switch. For two or more switches to be in the same MST region, they must have the identical MST name, VLAN-to-instance mapping, and MST revision number. Note Each command reference line creates its pending regional configuration in MST configuration mode. In addition, the pending region configuration starts with the current region configuration.
