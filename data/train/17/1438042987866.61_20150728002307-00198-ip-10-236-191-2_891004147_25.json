    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck We did things hands on, therefore we needed a variety of tools like fingerprint powder, evidence bags, cameras etc. The cameras alone cost a fortune! We were the only school that had the opportunity to use the cameras and learn about properly taking images for crime scenes. Definitely a bang for my buck! Did enjoy being here We did TONS of hands on work and we visited places like the county morgue, county jail, county crime lab, etc. This further enhanced my knowledge of the field. Did learn a lot I learned everything from fingerprinting to using the right tools for analyzing, collecting and preserving evidence. I also learned about police protocol, and the dangers that can occur on the job and how to avoid being in a hazardous situation.
