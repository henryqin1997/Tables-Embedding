            "The county police is right on campus, so there is no need to worry. They are literally in the middle of the campus.",
            "The freshmen that attend are shuttled up to Brasstown Bald, the tallest peak in Georgia. We have a picnic and just hangout for a bit the hike all the way back to the Young Harris campus. Then for your senior year, you hike up to the top of the peak, signaling that you have graduated and leaving the campus.",
            "The is always hiking! We are in the mountains! Plus there is The lake so there is kayaking and fishing!",
            "The food at Young Harris is great! The dinning hall always has plenty of options to chose from. The cafe in the recreation building is also very good. They have healthy choices and Starbucks coffee!!",
            "The Towers dorm is a must for freshmen. It helps you adjust to college life. The building is design to get students to interact with everyone else there.",
            "Classes here are not difficult, if you study. Studying is the key to college. Here, I believe that the professors actually care about their students. They try and make all of the material understandable for everyone."

I feel like I am suffocating because the campus is so small and if you happen to drink or smoke weed then you are always extremely paranoid because it is such a small town surrounding campus as well that cops are always at bay Greek Life it is growing, i am not personally a fan of any of the frat or sorority life, but there are some if you wanted to join. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus cupid falls, people used to go there to have sex and smoke weed, but no so much any more because the cops have become aware of this (we have a police station ON campus.. fantastic right?) The only good thing about having our own police station is that students dont get arrested for underaged drinking, but rather fined. It does get sketchy at night when you have a back pack on or anything on weekends, they",
