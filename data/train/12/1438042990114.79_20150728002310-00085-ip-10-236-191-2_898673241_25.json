            "Definitely a good deal for the money if you get the right professors. Especially if you're moving to Traverse City from a place like Flint like I did to go to school there.",
            "You can go to the beach during the warm months of the year and enjoy all that there is in Traverse City. During the winter, the college keeps throwing events out there for students to take advantage of-- especially if you live in the dorms. If you're a sports person, TC has its own semi-pro football team and rugby squads.",
            "Make sure you use ratemyprofessor.com and you'll find the best teacher's NMC has to offer.",
            "Generally good school. Small personal classes with a number of exceptional professors. I love the area and the professors I've had here."
