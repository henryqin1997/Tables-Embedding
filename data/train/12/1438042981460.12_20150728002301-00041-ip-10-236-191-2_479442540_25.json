    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{259095=Results were calculated as the number of antigen-specific IFN\u03b3 spot forming cells/million splenocytes (sfc/million). Differences between groups were determined by the students T-test (two-sample assuming equal variances) and ANOVA using Microsoft Excel 2000., 203224=Volunteers are monitored for enhanced immune responses and evidence of blood stage infection during the course of the trial, which runs through the malaria season (June to December)., 215889=At the biomedical primate centre (BPRC) in the Netherlands three cynomolgous macaques were immunised with BCG intradermally and administered MVA-Ag85A intradermally after 8 weeks and FP9-Ag85A intradermally after a further four weeks. In parallel three other macaques were immunised with BCG alone. Four weeks after the final immunisation all these macaques along with unimmunised macaques were challenged with a large intratracheal dose (of 1000 CFU) of M. tuberculosis. The animals were observed for 28 weeks, immunoassays performed and the animals were sacrificed at 28 weeks post-challenge and an autopsy performed., 127818=An NOI delivered by the vector delivery system may be used for selection or marker purposes. For example, the NOI may be a selection gene, or a marker gene. Many different selectable markers have been used successfully in retroviral vectors. These are reviewed in \u201cRetroviruses\u201d (1997 Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press Eds: J M Coffin, S M Hughes, H E Varmus, pp. 444) and include, but are not limited to, the bacterial neomycin and hygromycin phosphotransferase genes which confer resistance to G418 and hygromycin respectively; a mutant mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene which confers resistance to methotrexate; the bacterial gpt gene which allows cells to grow in medium containing mycophenolic acid, xanthine; the bacterial hisD gene which allows cells to grow in medium without histidine but containing histidinol; the multidrug resistance gene (mdr) which confers resistance to a variety of drugs; and the bacterial genes which confer resistance to puromycin or phleomycin. All of these markers are dominant selectable and allow chemical selection of most cells expressing these genes., 162599=In particular, a composition comprising a DNA plasmid vector may comprise granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or a plasmid encoding it, to act as an adjuvant; beneficial effects are seen using GM-CSF in polypeptide form. Adjuvants such as QS21 or SBAS2 (Stoute J A et al., 1997 N. Engl. J. Medicine 226: 8691) may be used with proteins, peptides or nucleic acids to enhance the induction of T cell responses., 228012=Results were calculated as the number of antigen-specific IFN\u03b3 spot forming cells/million splenocytes (sfc/million). Differences between groups were determined by the students T-test (two-sample assuming equal variances) using Microsoft Excel 2000., 283145=Statistical analysis was performed using Excel 2000, with differences in incidence of infection determined by the Chi-squared test and differences in viral load determined using the students T-test (two-sample assuming equal variances). Two-sided P-values are determined in all cases., 135842=If a viral vector system is used, it may be an advantage if it is derived from a different virus (i.e. not fowlpox) to minimise cross-reaction. The vector may be derived from another avipox virus, such as canary pox, or from a different genus of pox viruses (as shown in Table 2). Particularly preferred is an attenuated vaccinia vector system such as MVA or NVYAC. Other suitable viral vectors are vectors based on non-pox viruses, such as adeno virus, herpes virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE). Suitable bacterial vectors include recombinant BCG and recombinant Salmonella and Salmonella transformed with plasmid DNA (Darji A et al., 1997 Cell 91: 765-775)., 104484=Distinguishing features of each pox virus genus are known in the art, for example see Murphy et al. (1995-as above)., 220006=500 \u03bcl 2-Mercaptoethanol [50 \u03bcm] Gibco BRL 31350-010, 220490=Make up to 1000 ml with water and autoclave, 117364=Calculation of maximum % homology therefore firstly requires the production of an optimal alignment, taking into consideration gap penalties. A suitable computer program for carrying out such an alignment is the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package (University of Wisconsin, U.S.A.; Devereux et al., 1984, Nucleic Acids Research 12:387). Examples of other software than can perform sequence comparisons include, but are not limited to, the BLAST package (see Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid\u2014Chapter 18), FASTA (Atschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol., 403-410) and the GENEWORKS suite of comparison tools. Both BLAST and FASTA are available for offline and online searching (see Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid, pages 7-58 to 7-60). However, for some applications, it is preferred to use the GCG Bestfit program. A new tool, called BLAST 2 Sequences is also available for comparing protein and nucleotide sequence (see FEMS Microbiol Lett 1999 174(2): 247-50; FEMS Microbiol Lett 1999 177(1): 187-8 and tatiana@ncbi.nlm.nih. gov)., 95740=A detailed list of retroviruses may be found in Coffin et al., (\u201cRetroviruses\u201d 1997 Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press Eds: J M Coffin, S M Hughes, H E Varrnus pp 758763)., 219784=50 ml FCS [10%] Sigma F-2442, 71584=The majority of attenuated fowlpox vaccine strains are not fully defined in terms of their genome organisation and exact sequence. In fact, the genomes of some have recently been found to carry an infectious copy of the provirus of avian reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) (Hertig et al, 1997, Virology 235, 367-76) which may limit their use as recombinant vectors., 67967=Poxviruses have been previously exploited as recombinant vectors for the heterologous expression of foreign proteins. In particular, recombinant vaccinia virus has been studied as a tool for transient expression of genes in mammalian cells and an experimental recombinant vaccine vector (reviewed by Moss, 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 93, 11341-8; and Moss, 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 93, 11341-8)., 124149=The construction of recombinant poxviruses which express an NOI requires that the insertion of the NOI is made at a site which is nonessential for the replication of the viral genome. Suitable insertion sites for FP9 have been described (Pollitt et al., (1998) 17: 5-9; Laidlaw et al., 1998 J. Virol. 72, pp6742)., 187935=The MEPfTrap polypeptide, which consists of a string of T-cell epitopes from P. falciparum CSP and the Pb9 epitope (Gilbert et al., 1997 Nat. Biotechnol. 15, 1280-4) fused to the P. falcipraum TRAP gene (Robson et al., 1988, Nature 335, 79-82), was developed as an antigen for vaccination against P. falcipraum malaria in humans. FP9 encoding MEPfTrap has been constructed (Table 4) and shown to elicit CD8+ T-cell responses in potency tests carried out in Balb/c mice (107\ufffd20 IFN\u03b3 spot forming cells/million splenocytes)., 69781=Wild-type fowlpox viruses, which cause proliferative skin lesions that are rarely lethal in birds, are of commercial concern in the poultry industry. Live attenuated vaccines against fowlpox virus have been produced by multiple passage of the virus in avian cells. Such attenuated fowlpox viruses expressing antigens from poultry pathogens have been extensively exploited as recombinant vaccines for avian use (reviewed by Boyle and Heine, 1993, Immunol Cell Biol 71, 391-7; Paoletti, 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 93, 11349-53). In fact, two recombinant fowlpox viruses expressing antigens from Newcastle's disease virus are commercially available for veterinary use in the USA (Paoletti, 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 93, 11349-53)., 69092=Concern about the capacity of vaccinia virus to replicate in mammalian cells has limited its clinical use and led to the search for safer alternatives. These include attenuated vaccinia viruses, such as modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) (Meyer et al, 1991, J. Gen. Virol. 72, 1031-8; Sutter and Moss, 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 89, 10847-51; Sutter et al, 1994, Vaccine 12, 1032-40), which undergoes limited replication in human cells (Blanchard et al, 1998, J. Gen. Virol. 79, 1159-67), and the avipox viruses, such as fowlpox, which do not proliferate in mammalian cells (Somogyi et al, 1993, Virology 197, 439-44)., 176851=Two weeks following the booster immunisation, animals were challenged by intravenous injection with 2000 P. berghei sporozoites and subsequently monitored for blood stage infection 6 to 14 days after challenge (Table 2). Results are cumulative for four experiments., 203487=Further phase I studies are also conducted in the Gambia during 2002 using appropriate recombinant FP9 and MVA to vaccinate against Mycobacteria tuberculosis and HIV. Both trials are conducted using volunteers who are infected with the respective pathogens and, therefore, evalute both the capacity of FP9 and a heterologous primeboost immunisation regime using two non-replicating viruses to serve as a therapeutic vaccine., 334032=Female BALB/c (H-2d) or C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice (6-8 weeks old) were immunised intramuscularly (im.) with 50 \u03bcg of pSG2.ME1 or control plasmid pSG2.Me13, which contains an irrelevant epitope string. Viruses FP9.ME1 and the empty control virus FP9.EFL29 were administered intravenously (iv.) into the tail vein at a dose of 1\ufffd106 PFU. Animals were boosted 14-15 days after immunisation. Fourteen to 15 days after boosting, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the T cell response elicited against the LCMV, P815, CT26 and control epitopes from \u03b2-galactosidase were determined using the INF\u03b3 assay as described in above. Results were calculated as the number of antigen-specific IFN\u03b3 spot forming cells/million splenocytes (sfc/million). Differences between groups were determined by the student's T-test (two-sample assuming unequal variances) using Microsoft Excel 2000. One-sided P-values are given in all cases., 94760=Many viral vectors are known in the art which are capable of delivering an NOI via infection of a target cell. Suitable recombinant viral vectors include but are not limited to adenovirus vectors, adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, herpes-virus vectors, retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, baculoviral vectors, poxviral vectors or parvovirus vectors (see Kestler et al., 999 Human Gene Ther. 10(10):1619-32)., 163738=In general, a therapeutically effective daily intradermal or intramuscular dose of the compositions of the present invention is likely to range from 105\u22121010 plaque-forming units (pfu)., 204369=M. bovis BCG is widely administered to children throughout the developing world as a vaccine against tuberculosis caused by M. tuberculosis. Although effective against severe childhood forms of tuberculosis, the protective efficacy of M. bovis BCG against adult forms of the disease is highly variable and thought to wane over time. Since Ag85A is a major secreted antigen of both M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis, boosting the immune response elicited against Ag85A by M. bovis BCG immunization is a credible strategy for enhancing the protective efficacy of this vaccine against adult tuberculosis. This strategy has been pursued by others in murine models by boosting with recombinant Ag85A protein (Brooks et al., 2001 Infect. Immun. 69, 2714-7) or a DNA-vaccine encoding this antigen (Tanghe et al., 2001 Infect. Immun. 69, 3041-7)., 68424=In common with the other poxviruses, vaccinia virus resides within the cell cytoplasm where it expresses the proteins needed for viral replication. Recombinant vaccinia can, therefore, deliver foreign antigens to the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, thereby allowing them direct access to antigen processing pathways which leads to presentation of antigen derived peptides in association with MHC Class I and Class II molecules on the cell surface (Moss, 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 93, 11341-8). This property makes vaccinia useful as recombinant vaccines, particularly for stimulating CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell immune responses., 67349=This is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/GB02/05411, which designated the United States and was filed on Dec. 2, 2002, published in English, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/334,649, filed on Nov. 30, 2001, and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd 119 or 365 to Great Britain, Application No. 0128733.3, filed Nov. 30, 2001. The entire teachings of the above application(s) are incorporated herein by reference., 70577=The observation that avipox viruses can express antigens in mammalian cells and can induce a protective immune response against mammalian pathogens (Taylor and Paoletti, 1998, Vaccine 6, 466-8; Taylor et al, 1998a, Vaccine 6, 504-8; Taylor et al, 1988b, Vaccine 6, 497-503), led to the development of recombinant fowlpox viruses as vaccines for use in mammals. Most significantly, recombinant fowlpox expressing antigens from HIV have shown promise as vaccines in non-human primates (Dale et al, 2000, J Med Primatol 29, 240-7; Kent et al, 1988, J Virol 72, 10180-8; Kent et al, 2000, Vaccine 18, 2250-6). In addition, recombinant fowlpox vaccines encoding tumour-associated antigens have been evaluated in animals (Grosenbach et al, 2001, Cancer Res 61, 4497-505; Irvine et al, 1997, J Natl Cancer Inst 89, 1595-601; Wang et al, 1995, J Immunol 154, 4685-92) and are presently undergoing human clinical trials.}",

The total frequency of IFN\u03b3-secreting T cells elicited against LCMV epitopes by prime/boost immunisation with pSG2.ME1/FP9.ME1 was significantly higher than that elicited by homologous immunisation with FP9.ME1 (P w 0.003) alone or pSG2.ME 1 (P=0.016) alone. Interestingly, heterologous prime/boost immunization regimes using pSG2.ME1 and FP9.ME1 elicited greatly enhanced immune responses against CD8+ epitopes characterised as dominant and subdominant, and those recognised by CD4+ T cells when compared to the homologous immunisation regimes using pSG2.ME1 and",
