            "You can hang at the library and pick up movies to watch there or take home. Also the designated study area are great if you looking for quiet time. The physical fitness center is top notch. The various clubs and organizations are great also.",
            "The cafe's around campus are great and the cafeteria is also amazing.",
            "There is no dorm",
            "The courses are tough but fair, in the sense that you could get a lot work or homework to do, but you have so many outlets for help in any field that you are studying from teachers and students.",
            "Don't walk in thinking that since it's a community college it is lesser in any way to an four-year university. This college is designed to educate you the same way as a four-year, but it is better because it is cheaper and smaller, so you won't be overlooked by any teacher in your classes. I'm sure you won't be on half the personal level with your teachers at an university.",
            "MCCC is a great college to attend. Every teacher is willing to work with you, if you need the help and they actually want to help. The student body is great also, it's such a great place to make friends because of the awesome diversity at the school."
