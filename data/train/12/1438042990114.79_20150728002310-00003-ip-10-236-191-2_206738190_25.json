While working as a radio and television technician, he was brought an Eheim pump for repair. At the time, Eheim was a well-known toy manufacturer and offered a centrifugal pump for use in powering fountains on model railroad sets. Tunze noted the pump added to the liveliness in his aquarium when he tested the repaired pump. At that time all pumps had a bottom intake and a top outlet; he decided that it should be possible to produce a pump specifically for the purpose of flow in the aquarium and this would necessitate a forward flow. Mr. Tunze patented the forward direction of flow which made his invention possible- the Tunze Turbelle 400. The first powerhead was called the Turbelle, from the combined German words \"Turbine\" and \"Libelle\"- German for dragonfly. The first powerhead, as we now generally call this group of pumps, used eight watts to pump 430l/h with a top-mounted air-cooled motor. Within the past 40 years tremendous advances have been made, including most recently the broad flow powerheads.}",
