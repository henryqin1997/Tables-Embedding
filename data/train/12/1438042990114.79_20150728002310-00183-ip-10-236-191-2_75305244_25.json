Defining the corresponding element span usages for the components, defines which Retropay elements get generated for the different time periods. Element Span Usage Otherwise, the formula runs the function to generate a better estimate for gross, using the remainder to determine by how much to change the guess. The formula checks the results in another iteration. If the additional amount is above or below the balance total by an acceptable margin, then the processing ends and the formula returns the remainder (additional amount - balance) to the element's Remainder input value. If the additional amount equals the balance total, then the iterative processing ends. In the next iteration, the iterative formula compares the additional amount to the total value of the balances that are available for grossup for this element entry. The additional amount must not differ from this balance total by more than the amount you specified in To Within field. The element's payroll formula runs (CALC_GROSSUP_PAY_VALUE). It adds the additional amount to the desired amount to create the gross and returns this value to the element's pay value for the payroll run to process.",

For information on uploading initial balances, please refer to the appropriate Legislative Balance Initialization technical essay. Write Payroll Formulas Oracle Payroll provides formulas for processing legislative deductions. For other elements, you can write formulas to calculate element results and other processing outcomes in payroll runs. See: Writing Payroll Formulas for Elements, Oracle HRMS FastFormula User Guide. Define Formula Processing and Result Rules To define which formula processes an element for Active assignments (and optionally for other assignment statuses), define processing rules for the element. To specify what happens to formula results (that is, the values you include in the formula's Return statement), define formula result rules. See: Defining Formula Processing and Result Rules. Define Rules for Net-to-Gross Processing If your localization supports net-to-gross processing, you can define rules for iterative processing of earnings and for excluding balances. Define rules for the processing of the iterative formula. See: Defining Iterative Processing Rules, Oracle HRMS Compensation and Benefits Management Guide. Specify which balances to exclude from the net-to-gross calculation. See: Excluding Balances From an Element's Grossup Calculation, Oracle HRMS Compensation and Benefits Management Guide.
