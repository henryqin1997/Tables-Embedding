            "When the maple leaves turn red in the fall, there's cider, cookies, and live harp music on the Quad. It's really a special time and it's fun to be a part of.",
            "There's always something to do on or off campus. Students are given a free bus pass for ART (the Asheville bus system). You can go Downtown, go to the drum circle, get some ice cream at The Hop, or just go for walks on our nature trails. There's always activities going on around campus (yoga, fencing, belly dancing, photography, block parties... you name it). There's also places like the game room where you can play video game, pool, or ping pong. If you are looking for something to do for fun, you won't have trouble finding it.",
            "UNCA has a wide range of options to choose from. They serve plenty of vegetarian/ vegan options along with separate meat options. The dining hall is fantastic.",
            "The dorms (residence halls) make you feel at home. It really does become your home away from home.",
            "Make sure to get involved! If you get involved with things that interest you, you will meet all kinds of people that have similar interest.",
            "UNCA is a unique experience itself. Located right next to Downtown Asheville, there is always something to do on or off campus. No matter where you go, there is always a friendly face to talk to."

I've recently visited Asheville downtown and there was just a random free hula-hoop festival going on with good music in the middle of the city! Bang for the buck I only have to pay $5,500 in loans each year due to the generous scholarships, grants, and overall financial aid they have awarded me. Will enjoy being here This place seems to fit me perfectly as the hippie, free-loving, all-accepting place it is. Will learn a lot Out of the professors I've met so far, they seem to be generally interested in the students. They're here for them because if they weren't, they wouldn't bother to work there. The school is focused on undergraduates only- there are maybe 40 people going for a master's degree.
