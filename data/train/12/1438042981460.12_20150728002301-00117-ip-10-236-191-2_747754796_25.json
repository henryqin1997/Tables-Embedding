    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{68193=This unit does well in scoring touchdowns and is above average in yards each season. One of the keys to the Saints offense is that they feature a deeper passing scheme as shown by their healthy average gain per completion. Hardly any reason to make changes to a team that just won the Super Bowl. With three wideouts turning in over 700 yards each, this is a very productive group and not much room for any other wideouts to step up. Marquez Colston, Robert Meachem and Devery Henderson account for almost all the stats of this highly productive group. The only notable going into camp is the status of Meachem's toe that required surgery and a pin (later removed) but that is still not 100%. Expectations by the team is that he'll be ready for the season if not training camp and that also holds true for Henderson who underwent sports hernia surgery in May., 87165=Granted - the receiver numbers from San Francisco were low last year but there were big developments along the way that will pay off in 2010. Michael Crabtree did not sign until week six and even without the benefit of any training camp still had 48 catches for 625 yards and two scores. The bar should be lifted much higher for him in 2010 with a full offseason and preseason under his belt. Crabtree was the consensus best receiver in the 2009 NFL draft. This year he gets a chance to show more. The 49ers also switched to Alex Smith in week seven with far better results. Smith scored in all but one game and over half his games had more than one score. Josh Morgan remains the starting flanker and will almost certainly post less than stellar numbers as the #3. Jason Hill will challenge for the slot role since Ted Ginn has yet to show he really deserves it. The one to watch here is Crabtree who could be big this season - he should be no worse than the spot you draft him at., 90038=The acquisition of T.J. Houshmandzadeh has done little to spark the receiver numbers and the ex-Bengal only managed 79 catches for 911 yards and three scores - his worst showing in his six year career. At 33 years of age, Houshmandzadeh's best days are behind him. In Seattle, they are shrinking in the rear view mirror in a hurry. Housh said that he actually played with three broken ribs for the first six weeks of last year and then started having groin problems. He is still not 100% recovered from a sports hernia and could be more susceptible to have another. Deion Branch has been the other starter but he is recovering from a knee scope. There is a coming tilling of the soil here with the only question being when? Deon Butler has been very impressive in the offseason and HC Pete Carroll has singled him out for being so improved. The Seahawks also drafted Golden Tate from Notre Dame with their 2.28 selection. This could be a very interesting camp for this year since a transition is underway. In a dynasty league, it takes great importance since the 2011 starters may be Butler and or Tate. But even for this season, both starters from last year are still injured and being pushed by the youngsters on a team with all new coaches and no no allegiances. Butler and Tate both should be tracked., 55316=This has long been an average unit at best but there is at least some optimism that 2010 can see an improvement with Mike Sims-Walker who had a minor breakout last year with 869 yards and seven scores and Mike Thomas (453 yards and one TD). The problem with the passing game is mostly inconsistency since both receivers had big games but also turned in some very bad ones as well. Jarrett Dillard should keep the #3 role and has been very impressive in the offseason but not enough to challenge for the #2 spot from Thomas. The one to watch here is Thomas who enters his second season., 70945=It was the season of most concern and unknowns. And it was also one of the best seasons ever for Giants wideouts. After purging the team of Plaxico Burress and Amani Toomer, the Giants entered 2009 with one of the youngest sets of receivers in the entire NFL. No problem. They responded with top five numbers for catches, yards and scores. Steve Smith (107-1220, 7 TD) and Mario Manningham (57-822, 5 TD) started the season and it did not take long for Hakeem Nicks (47-790, 6 TD) to turn in a great rookie campaign. It was somewhat a need since the rushing game fell apart in New York last year due to injuries. No changes here other than wanting to see just how much better this group can get now that they have a bit more experience., 79071=Though Donovan McNabb is finally gone, there are reasons to expect the Eagles wideouts to at least maintain what is generally above average marks in receiving categories. Kevin Kolb gets his chance to start and he's already been productive in brief playing time in the past. DeSean Jackson had a breakout last year when he caught 62 passes for 1156 yards and nine scores. The rookie Jeremy Maclin was also impressive with his 56 receptions for 773 yards and four scores. Throw in Brent Celek and Kolb has plenty of targets. What camp needs to do is just get the wideouts used to Kolb and see if Maclin appears ready for the next step up. He'll be a good one to be sure, it will either happen now or in a traditional third-year breakout in 2011., 95828=Should you crave inexperienced and young wide receivers, make the Buccaneers your one-stop shop. Antonio Bryant is gone and the starters are slated to be Arrelious Benn and Mike Williams (not the fat one from USC, the fast one from Syracuse this year). The slot will likely be manned by Sammie Stroughter though Reggie Brown (yes, seriously, ex-Eagle Reggie Brown) may challenge him for the job. New OC Greg Olsen is installing a new offense that still wants to run-first. Josh Freeman enters his first season as the starter and all this youth has all but drained the fantasy value from this team. Benn and Williams are worth watching but Antonio Bryant was the lead wideout in 2009 with only 39 catches for 600 yards and four scores. Dynasty picks for Benn and Williams but minimal expectations on the pair for this year., 62778=Major strides were made last year when Tarvaris Jackson was benched and Brett Favre played. Sidney Rice (1312 yards, 8 TD) had a break out season and joins the ranks of the super-talented. Bernard Berrian (618 yards, 4 TD) was a serviceable #2 and the then rookie Percy Harvin not only had 790 yards and six scores as a receiver, he added 135 yards on 15 carries as well. The same unit returns and should be even better. Harvin is the one to watch in camp because if he can take another step up, the Vikes become an absolute offensive juggernaut. No changes but having one more year of experience from 2009 is a good thing with this youthful group., 50151=The Texans almost lost Kevin Walter who explored his options as an RFA but he remains with the Texans and with that brings back the same set of receivers from 2009. Andre Johnson was the #1 wideout in most fantasy leagues last year and Walter had 611 yards and just two touchdowns - a drop from the 899 yards and eight scores from 2008. But he lost out on some work to Jacoby Jones who ended with a career best 437 yards and six scores. Jones has been the object of praise in the offseason and HC Gary Kubiak has said that Jones is showing maturity and finally taking the next step. He'll need a great camp to unseat Walter but even if he doesn't, Jones made some noise as the #3 last year already. Jones is the one to watch here., 81709=The Steelers come off a tremendous season using the wide receivers for very high marks including third best yardage in the league. But that was then, this is now. Ben Roethlisberger is out for four to six weeks depending on the whims of the commissioner. Byron Leftwich is the likely replacement and that alone depresses numbers. But Santonio Holmes is also gone and with him 1248 yards and five scores from last year. Hines Ward has continued to be nearly ageless (34) and Mike Wallace has been good enough that they were comfortable sending Holmes packing. Wallace gained a heady 756 yards on just 39 receptions last season and scored six times. Wallace is the one to watch and the second year player is in a perfect spot for a breakout season unless Leftwich for a month and a very daunting schedule conspire to limit his potential this season., 34353=The last two years, Carson Palmer has either been injured or not playing well and the results are obvious above. For 2010, it will really be all up to Palmer because the Bengals have restocked the shelves and more than amply replaced T.J. Houshmandzadeh unlike last year. Chad Ochocinco remains the team's stud wideout and reality show star. But Antonio Bryant was brought in and joins Matt Jones who may stick. Andre Caldwell is having a great offseason and could figure in. The team also drafted ex-UT star Jordan Shipley. There will be plenty of wideouts to throw to this year. The question is how well Palmer will throw it and if anyone behind Ochocinco and Bryant will factor in. As cheaply as Palmer and these wideouts are coming in drafts, they are worth a flyer or two for your team depth., 110938=Use of this website constitutes acceptance of it's Privacy Notice and Terms of Use. \u00a9 2015 THEHUDDLE.COM. Part of USA TODAY Sports Digital Properties., 45179=This training camp is going to be important since Matt Stafford has new weapons to use. Calvin Johnson was a disappointment in 2009 with only 945 yards and five scores after logging 1331 yards and 13 scores as a rookie. Overall, the total numbers were much the same. This year Johnson will not be standing alone. Nate Burleson comes in to be the starting flanker and Bryant Johnson is moved to the slot. That should help Burleson's constant double teams at least slightly and Stafford will have a year under his belt this time. Burleson is the one to watch here, both to see what he might do and how much he can help ease the defensive focus on Johnson., 84450=The Chargers ranked low on most aspects of wide receivers because of Antonio Gates workload and having Vincent Jackson take a heavy portion of the wideout targets. Jackson ended 2009 with 1167 yards and nine scores. The best any other wideout had was only two touchdowns. Chris Chambers was released during the season and Malcolm Floyd took over with decent results - 45 receptions for 776 yards and one score. Floyd turns 29 this year so he's no youngster but he'll not only be the #2, he'll take a bigger role when Jackson sits out the first three games of the season because of a drug suspension. If Jackson proves successful in prompting a trade - more unlikely every day - it would really be a big hit on this unit. In camp, the one to watch is Floyd. Josh Reed signed a one-year contract but he is only depth., 39597=No doubt dynasty leaguers will be following this training camp. Miles Austin was the surprise wideout of 2009 when he rolled up 81 catches for 1321 and 11 scores despite almost no action in the first four games. Now the Cowboys have drafted Dez Bryant with fingers crossed that they can make amends for skipping on that Randy Moss guy a few years back. Bryant has already been impressive in camp and will be a direct challenge with Roy Williams for the #2 spot. Fantasy drafts indicate that everyone thinks Bryant is the clear winner of the #2 job and worthy of the risk because he is being taken as a low end starter in most leagues. The Cowboys offense looks potent this year and Bryant could be a missing piece of the puzzle that Williams never was.}",

    "textAfterTable": "2,102 7 9,846 5,648 74,564 431 While receiving numbers were up for running backs and tight ends, the wideouts showed only an small incremental increase last year and really no change from previous seasons. Healthy numbers that dwarf all other positions of course, but the increase in passing during the last couple of years has been more about including running backs and tight ends than receivers. The complexity of offenses is more about spreading the ball around now than just looking to throw to the two starting wideouts.
