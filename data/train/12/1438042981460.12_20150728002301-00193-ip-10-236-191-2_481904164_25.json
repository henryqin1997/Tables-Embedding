No. 6,827,946, entitled \u201cCompositions Containing Both Sedative and Non-Sedative Antihistamines\u201d by Mark Hirsh, Jane Hirsh, and Whe-Yong Lo., 41482=Nelson, J. Allergy & Clin. Immunology 112(4), S96-S100 October 203), \u201cProspects for antihistamines in the treatment of asthma\u201d, describes improvement in asthma control with montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, by co-administration with loratidine, a non-sedating antihistamine. As described in the abstract, the combination is thought to minimize the sedating effects of high levels of even non-sedating antihistamines, by reducing the amount required. Nelson, however, does not describe compositions containing a sedating and non-sedating antihistamine., 123131=In order to allow an easier swallowing, the amount for one dosage unit (1094.1 mg) may be divided into two double-layer tablets each contains 547 mg (133 mg granulation C first layer and 414 mg granulation D the second layer). In this case, the patient will be instructed to take two tablets instead of one tablet per dose., 118260=2.
