Extended field format Centered format Right-justified format Left-justified format The number of characters You cannot use a trailing minus sign and Credit/Debit formatting in the same numeric field. Using the Credit/Debit formatting character causes the value to be printed with a leading space. 14.4 Printing Strings With the PRINT USING statement, you can specify the following aspects of string format: $5.00CR $200.00DR $552.35CR       Output      PRINT USING FM, -552.35, 200, -5 DECLARE STRING CONSTANT FM = \"$$####.##<cd>\"      14.3.3.8 Debits and Credits   You can have BASIC use credit and debit notation to differentiate positive and negative numbers. To do this, you place the characters <CD> (Credit/Debit) at the end of the numeric format string. This causes BASIC to print CR (Credit Record) after negative numbers, and DR (Debit Record) after positive numbers and zero.     -5000.00 1000.00       Output      PRINT USING FM, 1000, 0, .001, -5000 DECLARE STRING CONSTANT FM = \"<%>####.##\"",

For extended fields, BASIC extends the field to print the entire string. If a string to be printed is shorter than the format field, BASIC pads the string field with spaces. For more information about extended fields, see Section 14.4.4. A string field containing only a single quotation mark is a 1-character string field. BASIC prints the first character of the string expression corresponding to a 1-character string field and ignores all following characters.
