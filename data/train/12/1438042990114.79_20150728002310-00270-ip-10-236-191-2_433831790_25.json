He had recorded Notts' best T20 figures of the summer of 5-22, against Lancashire, but he only played in one Championship match during a season when Notts were not exactly replete with spin options. He also had two loan spells at Northants, enough to persuade both White and his first county that it was time to renew acquaintances. ESPNcricinfo staff, 51203=Graeme White, a left-arm spinner, joined Nottinghamshire in 2010 after making eight first class appearances for his previous county, Northamptonshire, where he struggled to establish himself in competition with Monty Panesar and Nicky Boje. He made only one Championship appearance in his first season at Trent Bridge but put in a couple of significant performances in 2011, registering his first half-century for Nottinghamshire in a win over Lancashire at Southport and taking career-best bowling figures of 4 for 72 against Durham a week later, as well as playing a useful role in the shorter formats.}",
