            "Description",
            "STENT ASSEMBLY FOR THE TREATMENT OF VULNERABLE PLAQUE - An intravascular stent assembly for implantation in a body lumen, such as a coronary artery, is designed to treat a lesion with vulnerable plaque by reducing the fibrous cap stresses. A polymeric sleeve having first and second ends interconnects a first metallic stent and a second metallic stent. The first end is bonded to a distal end region of the first stent and the second end to a proximal end region of the second stent. The polymeric sleeve can be loaded with a therapeutic drug or agent to further control local thrombosis and/or induce healing if the plaque fibrous cap ruptures during or after implantation. Methods of making an intravascular stent assembly for the treatment of vulnerable plaque are also provided.",
            "STENT WITH DRUG COATING WITH VARIABLE RELEASE RATE - A stent is provided with a coating having a variable drug release rate. The release rate can be greater over a curved or bent segment of a strut network as compared to generally linear segments of the strut network. The coating can have a barrier region that is thicker over the generally linear segments. The coating can have a drug mixed with polymers. The curved or bent segment can have a greater amount of a polymer having relatively high drug permeability as compared to the generally linear segments.",
            "METHOD OF COATING A STENT HAVING VARIABLE DRUG RELEASE RATE - A method of coating a stent may comprise applying a composition including a drug and a polymer to the stent to form a coating. The release rate of the drug from the coating gradually increases along a length of the stent which extends axially from opposite ends of the stent. The variable drug release rate can be accomplished by varying the coating thickness, by applying a barrier region over the drug-containing composition, and/or by having different polymers in the coating, the polymers having different drug permeabilities.",
            "FLEXIBLE STENT - The present invention is directed to a flexible expandable stent for implantation in a body lumen, such as a coronary artery. The stent generally includes a series of metallic cylindrical rings longitudinally aligned on a common axis of the stent and interconnected by a series of links which be polymeric or metallic. Varying configurations and patterns of the links provides longitudinal and flexural flexibility to the stent while maintaining sufficient column strength to space the cylindrical rings along the longitudinal axis. The metallic material forming the rings provides the necessary radial stiffness.",
            "HYBRID STENT AND METHOD OF MAKING - A stent is formed by encasing or encapsulating metallic rings in an inner polymeric layer and an outer polymeric layer. At least one polymer link connects adjacent metallic rings. The stent is drug loaded with one or more therapeutic agent or drug, for example, to reduce the likelihood of the development of restenosis in the coronary arteries. The inner and outer polymeric materials can be of the same polymer or different polymer to achieve different results, such as enhancing flexibility and providing a stent that is visible under MRI, computer tomography and x-ray fluoroscopy.",

Up to three stents are mounted on two parallel balloon catheters wherein a proximal stent is disposed about both balloons while two distal stents are each disposed about one of the balloons. Such configuration enhances the flexibility of the assembly to facilitate its advancement through tortuous vasculature, while the structural independence of the stents maximizes the systems ability to spread into a wide range of bifurcation angles. A single link between each distal stent and the proximal stent may be relied upon to maintain relative stent position during deployment. 01-08-2009 Santosh Prabhu, Santa Clara, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20140306378 HYBRID STENT AND METHOD OF MAKING - A stent is formed by encasing or encapsulating metallic rings in an inner polymeric layer and an outer polymeric layer.
