In exemplary embodiments of asymmetric PCR, the amplification reaction composition is prepared with at least one primer set, wherein either the at least one first primer, or the at least one second primer, but not both, are added in excess. Thus, in certain embodiments, the excess primer to limiting primer ratio may be approximately 100:1, respectively. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the optimal amounts of the primers according to certain embodiments may be determined empirically. In certain embodiments, amounts will range from about 2 to 50 nM for the limiting primer, and from about 100 to 900 nM for the primer in excess. Empirically, in certain embodiments, the concentration of one primer in the primer set is typically kept below 5 pmol per 100 \u03bcl of amplification reaction composition.}",

Thus, an appropriate assay for polymerase catalytic activity might include, for example, measuring the ability of a variant to incorporate, under appropriate conditions, rNTPs or dNTPs into a nascent polynucleotide strand in a template-dependent manner. Likewise, an appropriate assay for ligase catalytic activity might include, for example, the ability to ligate adjacently hybridized oligonucleotides comprising appropriate reactive groups.

WO 98/22489, WO 98/39352, and WO 99/14226). Exemplary LNA sugar analogs within a polynucleotide include, but are not limited to, the structures:}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described with reference to certain applications, methods, and compositions, it will be appreciated that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention. Other assays that employed the same concentrations of materials and same thermal cycling conditions as assays 3 to 5, but that employed different probe sets to detect the presence or absence of two alleles at different loci, were also performed. Some of those assays included problems with the controls and at least one other had an erroneous result most likely due to a manual pipetting error. For the most part, the three assays correctly identified the presence or absence of the appropriate alleles at the three different loci of the three genomic DNA samples being analyzed with the three probe sets. The data for the replicates were not always as tight as may be desired according to certain embodiments. In Assay 5, the signal from the TaqMan\ufffd probe labeled with VIC indicated that the genomic DNA NA17247 was homozygous for the allele corresponding to the First Probe-CYC (5), which has a \u201cG\u201d as the nucleotide at the pivotal complement. Thus, the genomic DNA NA17247 correctly was determined to be homozygous at the locus analyzed in Assay 5 with \u201cC\u201d at the pivotal nucleotide. In Assay 5, the signals from the TaqMan\ufffd probes labeled with FAM and VIC indicated that the",
