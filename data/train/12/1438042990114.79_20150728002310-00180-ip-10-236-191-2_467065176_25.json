No. 6,518,239 which claims the benefit of priority of the following U.S. Provisional Patent Applications: Ser. No. 60/162,451 filed on Oct. 29, 1999; Ser. No. 60/164,236 filed on Nov. 8, 1999; Ser. No. 60/172,769 filed on Dec. 20, 1999; Ser. No. 60/178,383 filed on Jan. 27, 2000; and Ser. No. 60/178,415 filed on Jan. 27, 2000, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 79524=The powders of the invention are further characterized by an aerosol particle size distribution less than about 10 \u03bcm mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), and preferably less than 4.0 \u03bcm. The mass median aerodynamic diameters of the powders will characteristically range from about 0.1-10 \u03bcm, preferably from about 0.2-5.0 \u03bcm MMAD, more preferably from about 1.0-4.0 \u03bcm MMAD, and even more preferably from about 1.5 to 3.5 \u03bcm. Illustrative MMAD values for exemplary di-leucyl-peptide-containing powder compositions are provided in Examples 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Several of these examples demonstrate an improvement in aerosol particle size distribution achieved upon incorporation of a di-leucyl di- or tripeptide into the formulation., 76352=Alternatively, powders may be prepared by lyophilization, vacuum drying, spray freeze drying, super critical fluid processing, air drying, or other forms of evaporative drying. In some instances, it may be desirable to provide the dry powder formulation in a form that possesses improved handling/processing characteristics, e.g., reduced static, better flowability, low caking, and the like, by preparing compositions composed of fine particle aggregates, that is, aggregates or agglomerates of the above-described dry powder particles, where the aggregates are readily broken back down to the fine powder components for pulmonary delivery, as described, e.g., in Johnson, K., et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,007, 1997, incorporated herein by reference., 85577=When administered using a device of this type, the powder is contained in a receptacle having a puncturable lid or other access surface, preferably a blister package or cartridge, where the receptable may contain a single dosage unit or multiple dosage units. Convenient methods for filling large numbers of cavities (i.e., unit dose packages) with metered doses of dry powder medicament are described, e.g., in Parks, D. J., et al., WO 97/41031 (1997) incorporated herein by reference., 71700=Dry powder formulations are preferably prepared by spray drying. Spray drying of the formulations is carried out, for example, as described generally in the \u201cSpray Drying Handbook\u201d, 5th ed., K. Masters, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY, N.Y. (1991), and in Platz, R., et al., International Patent Publication No. WO 97/41833 (1997), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference., 67218=Pharmaceutical excipients and additives useful in the present composition include but are not limited to amino acids, peptides, proteins, non-biological polymers, biological polymers, carbohydrates (e.g., sugars, derivatized sugars such as alditols, aldonic acids, esterified sugars, and sugar polymers), which may be present singly or in combination. Suitable excipients are those provided in Inhale Therapeutic Systems' International Publication No. WO 96/32096. Also preferred are excipients having glass transition temperatures (Tg), above about 35\ufffd C., preferably above about 40\ufffd C., more preferably above 45\ufffd C., most preferably above about 55\ufffd C., 86481=Other dry powder dispersion devices for pulmonarily administering dry powders include those described, for example, in Newell, R. E., et al, European Patent No. EP 129985 (1988); in Hodson, P. D., et al, European Patent No. EP 472598 (1996); in Cocozza, S., et al., European Patent No. EP 467172 (1994), and in Lloyd, L. J. et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,522,385 (1996), incorporated herein by reference. Also suitable for delivering the dry powders of the invention are inhalation devices such as the Astra-Draco \u201cTURBUHALER\u201d. This type of device is described in detail in Virtanen, R., U.S. Pat. No. 4,668,281 (1987); in Wetterlin, K., et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,667,668 (1987); and in Wetterlin, K., et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,805,811 (1989), all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Other suitable devices include dry powder inhalers such as the Rotahaler\ufffd (Glaxo), Discus\ufffd (Glaxo), Spiros\u2122 inhaler (Dura Pharmaceuticals), and the Spinhaler\ufffd (Fisons). Also suitable are devices which employ the use of a piston to provide air for either entraining powdered medicament, lifting medicament from a carrier screen by passing air through the screen, or mixing air with powder medicament in a mixing chamber with subsequent introduction of the powder to the patient through the mouthpiece of the device, such as described in Mulhauser, P., et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,388,572 (1997), incorporated herein by reference., 171200=Powders were produced by spray drying aqueous solutions of PTH as described in A. above using a Buchi 190 mini spray dryer (Buchi Labortechnik AG, Meierseggstrasse, Switzerland) equipped with a customized nozzle (Platz, R., et al., Inhale Therapeutic Systems' International Patent Publication No. WO 97/41833, Nov. 13, 1997) and cyclone. High collection efficiencies (yields), usually between about 50-80%, were attained., 77122=In another approach, dry powders may be prepared by agglomerating the powder components, sieving the materials to obtain agglomerates, spheronizing to provide a more spherical agglomerate, and sizing to obtain a uniformly-sized product, as described, e.g., and in Ahlneck, C., et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 95/09616, 1995, incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the ESCA results for the calcitonin powders are subject to some variability (this is due to the difficulty of separating out surface concentration contributions by components having the same atom within their structures i.e., calcitonin vs. trileucine), the overall trend observed supports the finding of powders in which the surface concentration of the di-leucyl di- or tripeptide is greater than that in the bulk powder. The above results indicate that powders containing a surface active material are enriched at the surface in concentration of surface active material. Surface enrichment of di- or trileucine is observed for both the non-active agent containing powders in Table 18 and for the s. calcitonin powders in Table 19. 2.0 35 Raflinose 81.6 60 Leucine-3 pH4 16.4 5 Scal R99439 2.5 55 Raffinose 74.8 40 Leucine-3 pH4 22.7 5 Scal R99438 29.4 75 Raffinose 24.2 20 Leucine-3 pH4 46.4 5 Scal R99437 75.1 90",
