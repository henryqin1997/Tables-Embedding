In their original work, Cantell et al. report that experiments aimed at identifying those ingredients in EMEM needed for optimum yields of interferon give conflicting results (see Example 2)., 67651=This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/085,392, filed May 16, 1998., 68090=Usually animal cells are cultured in media, containing all necessary amino acids, vitamins, an energy source e.g. glucose and a balanced salt solution. The media can also contain trace amounts of different hormones such as insulin. The different components in the media can be altered depending on cell type and also the amount of the different components can be altered depending on the intended use. Some of these media are commercially available such as EMEM (Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium) which is well suited for a broad spectrum of mammalian cells, RPMI 1640, which was originally formulated for suspension cultures or monolayer cultures of human leukaemic cells, and DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media) also well suited for broad spectrum of mammalian cells. In many cases, sera such as bovine serum and the like are added thereto. The addition of for example bovine serum is often necessary for accomplishing the desired growth and viability of the cultured cells., 70655=Further U.S. Pat. No. 5,358,708 describes the addition of methionine for the stabilisation of interferon formulations in an amount of 2 mg/ml or in a ratio of methionine to protein component of 10:1-100:1., 91336=In the examples, the following abbreviations will be used: BNLM\u2014the inventive medium; BNL\u2014the inventive medium without L-methionine; GIBCO-EMEM manufactured by GIBCO; EMEM-EMEM manufactured according to Cantell (K. Cantell, S. Hirvonen, H.-L. Kauppinen, G. Myllyl\ufffd, Methods of Enzymology, Vol. 78, p. 29-38, Academic Press, 1981) with phosphate and an increased amount of glucose (5 g/l); CM-simple media according to Cantell (H.-L. Kauppinen, G. Myllyl\ufffd, and K. Cantell in \u201cHuman Interferon\u201d (W. R. Stinebring and P. J. Chapple, eds.), p. 1 Plenum, New York, 1978); CMV-simple media according to Cantell (1978) but without L-glutamine, decreased amounts of Tricine and NaHCO3 and increased amount of glucose; PBS-Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) according to Dulbecco (SIGMA Cell Culture Catalogue 1996, Product no. D 8662 or D 5780) with NaHCO3, Tricine, Glucose and Neomycin., 70187=The use of methionine in the formulation of polypeptide products for pharmaceutical or therapeutical use is known. Methionine is added to inhibit the oxidation of methionine residues with such polypeptides. According to U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,135 me thionine is added to a recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) formulation in amounts ranging from 0.01 to0.3% (w/v) or in a ratio of 10:1-100:1 to the methionine residues within the protein.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The trial in Example 4 was repeated with one exception. After incubation, 500 mg methionine/l was added to the BNL medium without L-methionine when the crude interferon was harvested. Shown in FIG. 2 are the HPLC chromatogram from purified samples of interferon produced by leukocytes incubated in BNL medium supplemented with 500 mg/l of L-methionine (upper panel) and from interferon produced in medium without L-methionine (lower panel) but with 500 mg/l of L-methionine added when harvesting. As can be seen, addition of methionine after incubation gives no effect on the interferon. The splitting of peaks remains. It is obvious that the methionine has to be present during incubation.
