Clubs and Activities Several different clubs and sports you can join. If they don't have something you want, create a new one. Great for these types of students Great for students who want to save money before they transfer to a different school, students who just need an Associate's degree, and those who want to stay close to home. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus The solar lounge is like geek heaven. But it can also be a cool place to meet up with friends, as long as you don't mind people playing video games in the background. Sometimes there's live guitar music too. Bang for the buck Worth it's money for a community college education. What to do for fun Join a club, sport, or activity. You'll meet new people and make friends that share interests with you. Attend a show at the planetarium or a theater performance.",
