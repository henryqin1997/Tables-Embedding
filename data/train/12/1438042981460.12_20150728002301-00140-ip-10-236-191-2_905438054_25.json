    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{169118=University of Virginia has many traditions. During Halloween, little children from the local community comes to the lawn to go trick-or-treating to the professors and the students who live on the lawn. During December, there is Lighting of the Lawn in which UVA hires people to put Christmas Lights around the Lawn Buildings and the Rotunda itself. Then, around finals week, everyone comes to the Lawn, drink eggnog, and watch UVA turn on the Christmas Lights. Also, for the past two years the school started to do a lights show! Finally, we have our most famous tradition---streaking on the lawn. Students would strip off their clothes at the steps of the Rotunda and run naked towards the statue of Homer at South Lawn. Then, the students would kiss the statue's butt and run back up to the Rotunda. They would peep in the the keyhole of the Rotunda, where they can see Thomas Jefferson's statue. As they peer into the building, they would say Good _________, Mr. Jefferson (the blank depends on what time of day/night it is. For example, 11pm=Good night, Mr. Jefferson.) After they go through all of that, they would quickly retrieve their clothes and wear them., 512845=Hey- ambulance rides are free, and if you or a friend happen to injure yourselves while out and about, drinking or sober--don't fret, just call the ambulance. The hospital is right next to campus, so it's never too far! The police are always on a look out, and understand that we're college kids--so even if you're worried about being caught drinking, don't be afraid to ask for help if necessary, because that's what they're there for. You can call Safe-Ride to give you a lift home after a long night at the 24-hr library, Clemons, from 2:30 AM- 5 AM, or take one of the school run buses!, 420898=I absolutely loved my hallmates and RA my first year. Dorm life is not as bad as it seems. You'll get used to the bathroom and the occasional door alarm, and you will cry when you have to leave it in May because you will make so many memories in your first year dorm that it will truly become your home. Old Dorms are the best!, 216579=We are often called a public ivy university - what does that tell you about our academics? At such a large school, introductory classes are undoubtedly large, but once you enter more specific classes in your areas of interest, class size dramatically decreases and the great, intimate learning environment with caring and knowledgeable professors many often prefer is established. Currently, the student to faculty ratio is 16:1 and 51.9 percent of classes are comprised of fewer than 20 students. With such statistics, one can truly make a large school as small as they prefer. Classes are often quite difficult, but as a UVA student, you have already demonstrated your academic excellence in high school and deserve to attend such a prestigious institution. It is not impossible to get a good grade by any means, and many classes do curve grades, but the proper effort must be put in place., 61954=for the high price, the food is mediocre. all first years (freshmen) are required to get a meal plan, which costs over $2000. for that price, one would expect much better food, but you just get mediocre dining hall food that you can at most eat 15 times a week (not that you would want to eat it any more often), 123234=The Activities Fair in August is almost overwhelming with how many different clubs there are to join!, 324538=Attending this university was one of the best decisions of my life. UVa definitely has something for everyone, and it's the number one public non-service university in the nation, as ranked by Forbes in 2012. Students here know both how to study and how serious getting an education is, but we also know how to have fun and get pumped about school sports, volunteering, and other community events., 137008=The University of Virginia has good dorms overall, and is constructing many new facilities (opening 2012-2014). These new dorms are great, and even the older dorms provide easy acces to classes, meals, and friends., 1585=Virginia's academic program has been described as rivaling some private universities' curricula, and you get to experience it at a public school price! The educational, social, and overall experiences at UVA are worth every cent of your tuition, but if it is necessary that you apply for financial aid, be very careful as you fill out your FAFSA (Federal Application for Student Aid) form. Due to a complex home situation this past year, I missed out on financial aid opportunities for the upcoming 2009-10 school year. Bottom line: UVA is worth its price tag, but it wouldn't hurt to fill out some scholarships either., 529603=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 37201=Even though UVa is a public school, you get a top notch education at a public school price! If you qualify for financial aid, you will be set because most of it will be covered! University of Virginia, for 2011 2nd Best Public University 25th Best Public/Private National University (tied with UCLA and Wake Forest) If you're instate, you really get a great education for a really low price! Out of state students aren't so lucky, but you get financial aid..if you have outside scholarships you will be set!

    "textAfterTable": "I've heard several people say Charlottesville is such a college town, meaning there's not much to do off-grounds. FALSE. Charlottesville is so much more than the University. With the pedestrian Downtown Mall (including two cinemas, one theater, and its very own ice rink), two more ordinary malls, Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, more restaurants per capita than New York City, and Carter Mountain Orchard for apple picking excursions, Charlottesville is so much more than your typical college town. There's something happening every minute, so schedule accordingly. That being said, relaxing in your dorm room every once in a while will not be frowned upon. Am learning a lot The great thing about UVA is that it is a public research university - meaning its resources attract the big names in most fields of study. This is great for you, the student, because you get to learn under such academics as Rita Dove and Larry Sabato. A caveat: UVA has a single sanction Honor Code. If you lie, cheat, or steal, you will be tried by a jury of your peers and if found guilty of a non-trivial offense, you will be expelled. Virginia expects a lot from her students academically, but if you put the time and energy into it, your efforts will be rewarded. Login to rate",
