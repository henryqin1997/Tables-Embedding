I am very interested in this college and is looking forward to going here in the year of 2012. I am sure that this is the best college for me to attend at for my RN career., 284055=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 162123=The food here is okay depending on what you get. They definitely have a lot of choices for students to pick with two main places to eat, a place to get food to go, a restaurant in one of the dorms, a coffee shop, small convenience stores/places to get food in each of the academic buildings, and a convenience store with more food and other products like toothpaste, cleaning products, and more. With so many places to choose from you are able to get a variety of foods, which really helps especially at the end of the semester. The only problem I have with the dining facilities are how early they close. Most are only open until 7:00 pm each night except for the dining place inside of the residence building., 191926=Athletics are big for fun on campus. Women's volleyball, basketball, and baseball are a few of the games I go to. Hanging around campus can be fun, however, I do wish there was more to do on the weekends, such as bowling, movies, etc. The weekends do get long and the city attractions such as restaurants and shopping are great but far away from campus and the buses only run until 6:00 p.m.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I would recommend to every student to get involved in the student government. It is a flawless way to meet new people, have fun, and help the university. It is also extremely important to be aware of your own needs and attend to them. If you are having any troubles with your roommate, your floor, or even a friend, talk to someone. Never be afraid to reach out to your Campus Advisor, academic advisor, or the professional advisors located on campus. They will always help you to fix a situation. Bang for the buck UW Oshkosh is such an exciting school to attend. There are always community events occurring and so many diverse ways to get involved and meet new people. The residence halls are also very well kept and safe. There are many measures taken to ensure the safety and integrity of the residents, such as locked resident halls to anyone without a key card, and bathroom keys for every floor. Every night there are guards at each entrance to ensure the protection of students, as well. The university itself offers a wide variety of majors, minors, and general education classes for anyone to enroll. The classes are very educational, and always appropriately challenging. Am enjoying being here For perhaps the first",
