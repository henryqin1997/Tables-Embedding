    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Your supplements are very important. No matter how awful your test scores are or your GPA if you can put together an intriguing essay you are in. Bang for the buck I feel like I am wasting away. The classes are not very challenging and the professors seem as enthused to be in class as I do. Class options are very limited and if you take a class at a 5 college it is very inconvenient. Am enjoying being here I feel like I am walking on egg shells every time I walk out of my room. If you do not enjoy doing drugs or smoking cigarettes in the gazebo finding friends is difficult and sometimes impossible. Being politically correct is the only way to get by at this school. The food at Saga (the cafeteria) is awful and the co-ed bathrooms take some getting use to. Hampshire is like a bubble. The public transportation is unreliable and getting anywhere but the school takes a while. Be prepared for a 4 hour trip to Target which by car would take 30 minutes. Am learning a lot Hampshire seems to be less about academics and more about self",
