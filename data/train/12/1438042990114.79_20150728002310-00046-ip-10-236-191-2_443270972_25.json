The P-type monocrystalline silicon substrate has a roughened surface to capture sunlight. A transparent conductive layer is stacked on the N-type amorphous SiGe film. Metal electrodes are formed on the transparent conductive layer and penetrate the transparent conductive layer to contact the N-type amorphous SiGe film. A P-type polycrystalline SiGe film is formed on the backside of the P-type monocrystalline silicon substrate. A back surface field is arranged below the P-type polycrystalline SiGe film to prevent from the recombination of major carriers. A backside metal electrode layer is arranged below the back surface field to function as a backside electrode and decrease the contact resistance. Thereby, the present invention can effectively promote the absorption rate of solar energy. 20110132456 Published Description Patent application number Tsong-Hsueh Wu, Yunlin County TW 01-16-2014 PROGRAMMABLE GAMMA CIRCUIT FOR LCD DISPLAY DEVICE AND RELATED METHOD AND DRIVER CIRCUIT - A programmable Gamma circuit of a LCD display device includes a control signal generator for generating multiple control signals; one or more voltage-reducing circuits for generating multiple voltage-reduced signals corresponding to a common voltage feedback signal outputted from a LC array of the LCD display device; and",
