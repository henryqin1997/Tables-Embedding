            "Join and keep up to date on SPEC, they plan everything fun! And if you are a nursing major - utilize absoluteyl every resource offered. Free tutoring, mentorship, job fairs, resume writing workshops and more. And if you plan to live on campus, I believe they still offer the chance for new students to spend an overnight weekend in the dorms.",
            "Saint Joe's has an awesome nursing program. The class sizes were small, each professor had an idea of how I was doing in other courses and even the Dean knew my name and how I was doing! I was amazed at how personal and empowering my experience was at this small Women's college."

Am enjoying being here I really enjoy this college. It is an all female college though. I have no problem with it. If you have a problem with it go somewhere else. There is a lot to do during the week. A lot of SPEC (Students Programming and Events Council) activities such as Spa Day, bingo, concerts, craft nights and comedians all for free. The weekends are really quiet her but perfect for homework and during the weekends you have to be willing to make your own fun. Am learning a lot You definitely learn a lot.
