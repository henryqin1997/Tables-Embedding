While this ongoing oversight did change the number of pending FOIA requests reported at the end of FY2012, we believe that this review reaffirms our commitment to providing and publishing the most accurate data for the purposes of FOIA reporting, ensured that all FOIA requests received by the Department are answered as accurately and completely as possible and gave an opportunity for OIS to continue addressing data reconciliation issues and make it a part of our regularly scheduled program reviews. In light of all this, the Department still managed to process more requests than it received, close all of the 10 oldest FOIA requests reported in the FY2012 report and exceed the required goals for backlog reduction., 207453=3/5/2012 398, 402687=6/12/2013 75, 417668=2/17/2012 406, 5590=The Department received a total of 18,755 initial requests for records during Fiscal Year 2013, a slight increase from 18,560 received in FY2012.

As part of this audit in FY2012, we located a large number of records that had been improperly listed in the FOIA request system with a pending \"Action Required\" or \"AR\" code. When records are in an \"AR\" status, SIMS-FOIA does not track them for timeliness or any other processing milestone. An early review of our progress to reconcile the data indicated that the FY2012 efforts were successful. However, as we began preparing data for the current report, we located an additional 191 requests that remained in \"AR\" status at the close of FY2012, meaning requests were received by DOL in FY2012, but were not converted for processing and tracking purposes until after the close of the fiscal year. Since SIMS-FOIA records that are in \"AR\" status are not included in the tracking system's data collections, the addition of these 191 records to the FY2013 Annual Report means that the number of requests pending as of the start of FY2013 will not reconcile back to the number of requests pending as of the end of FY2012. Specifically, in FY2012 DOL reported 1,475 FOIA requests pending at the end of the fiscal year. This year, DOL is reporting 1,666 requests pending at the start of FY2013. The difference between these numbers represents the 191 requests discovered as a part of our continuing oversight of the data audit we began in FY2012. This report incorporates a footnote in Section V. (A.) to reconcile that difference. These additional requests do not impact backlog numbers for FY2012, nor result in differences in other parts of the report.

Whereas all of DOL had 740 backlogged requests at the end of FY2012 (as indicated by the updated data), by the end of FY2013, we were still able to achieve an overall reduction of 19% in the agency\u2019s backlog. This is attributed to the continuing oversight of the departmental management of the FOIA program, the hard work of DOL\u2019s FOIA staff, consistent monitoring of FOIA related performance measures, and sustained effort toward backlog reduction throughout the Department\u2019s 23 FOIA components., 395663=8/30/2013 18, 405604=7/12/2013 56, 15583=U.S. Department of Labor City Center Square Building 1100 Main Street Kansas City, Missouri 64105-2112 (816) 426-3891 (For Wage and Hour Division only: Contact Region V), 401753=8/17/2013 34, 203950=4/3/2012 377, 399532=3/20/2012 387, 398943=7/16/2012 303, 223493=10/27/2011 484 MSHA, 397297=2/17/2012 408, 418247=6/27/2012 308, 224582=1/4/2011 690 OASAM, 205085=11/15/2011 471, 210614=1/10/2011 685, 223736=8/16/2011 533 OASAM, 422437=8/19/2010 782 WHD, 224220=5/23/2011 592 OASAM, 406185=5/7/2013 101, 198967=9/11/2012 264, 397070=4/9/2012 364, 399997=7/30/2013 35, 421900=7/1/2011 565 WHD, 400938=4/13/2011 620, 397533=1/11/2012 432, 402920=5/20/2013 92, 203327=4/17/2013 116, 396593=11/6/2012 165, 208167=9/26/2012 254, 396123=3/13/2013 16, 205800=3/14/2013 140, 415242=4/4/2012 374, 200563=11/6/2012 225, 199485=5/23/2012 341, 206217=9/27/2012 253, 407241=9/12/2012 263, 204356=12/11/2012 203, 416958=5/10/2012 349, 413618=4/20/2013 112, 406772=3/4/2013 147, 405370=7/23/2013 43, 418602=10/4/2011 495, 305187=1068, 480351=9/13/2013 12, 421766=9/20/2011 512 WHD, 202817=11/21/1011 468, 400467=5/28/2013 87, 507163=9/8/2013 17, 405254=8/1/2013 33, 205697=8/19/2013 30, 398008=9/20/2011 512, 211509=11/20/2012 217, 462185=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 U.S. Department of Labor FOIA regulations and fee schedule can be accessed via the DOL public FOIA website at the following link: http://webapps.dol.gov/FederalRegister/PdfDisplay.aspx?DocId=11855, 206321=12/28/2011 443, 540366=[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As noted above in the Executive Summary, during this fiscal year DOL, in its continuing oversight of the data audit initiated in FY2012, located 191 FOIA requests that were received during the fiscal year but were not converted for processing and tracking purposes until after the close of the fiscal year.
