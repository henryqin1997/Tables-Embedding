They make you feel at home in a sense I really dont feel like a number and they always have a suggestion or at least let me vent so I am not as frustrated. I hope they get more funding again because this Summer 2012 they could not offer any classes!, 211899=2014 will be 100 years of San Diego City College., 270299=I've attended Mira Costa, Palomar and this is my third community college. While busy, so far it seems as though City College has the best instructors. In terms of enrollment, it can be tough and confusing to get in, but once done everything runs smoothly., 11617=I graduated High School in 2007, and joined the Marine Corps for 4 years.

    "textAfterTable": "What to do for fun Join student clubs and awareness groups, it will help to get a feel for the campus as well as creating a network of fellow students so that you can stay involved an motivated in you courses. Food and Dining The cafeteria and student store offer a wide variety of food and snacks, stick the the fresh stuff though, the junk food is tempting but it will only slow you down and empty your wallet! Dorm Life I live off campus, there is a lot of street parking but you must work to find it, always leave enough time to find parking, even with a parking pass. Academic Rigor The professor's expect that we will transfer to a 4-year university and so they hold at the same standard, be vigilant about assignments and quality of work. Tips for prospective students Sign up for classes early! The budget cuts are hitting us hard, complete all necessary admissions and financial aid forms before the beginning of the semester to avoid long lines and over worked clerks.
