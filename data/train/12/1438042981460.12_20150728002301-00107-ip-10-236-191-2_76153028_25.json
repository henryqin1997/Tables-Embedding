Specifies the context path and service URI sections of the URL used to invoke the Web Service over the JMS transport, as well as the name of the port in the generated WSDL. You also use this annotation to specify the JMS queue to which WebLogic Server queues the SOAP request messages from invokes of the operations. Target: Class Description The following sections describe the annotation in detail. weblogic.jws.WLJmsTransport serviceUri=\"SimpleSecureBean\") contextPath=\"secure\", @WLHttpsTransport(portName=\"helloSecurePort\",  Example       No String The name of the port in the generated WSDL. This attribute maps to the name attribute of the <port> element in the WSDL. The default value of this attribute is based on the @javax.jws.WebService annotation of the JWS file. In particular, the default portName is the value of the name attribute of @WebService annotation, plus the actual text SoapPort. For example, if @WebService.name is set to MyService, then the default portName is MyServiceSoapPort. portName",

Description Target: Class Specifies whether to expose the WSDL of a deployed WebLogic Web Service. By default, the WSDL is exposed at the following URL:  http://[host]:[port]/[contextPath]/[serviceUri]?WSDL where: host refers to the computer on which WebLogic Server is running. port refers to the port number on which WebLogic Server is listening (default value is 7001). contextPath and serviceUri refer to the value of the contextPath and serviceUri attributes, respectively, of the @WLHttpTransport JWS annotation of the JWS file that implements your Web Service. For example, assume you used the following @WLHttpTransport annotation:  @WLHttpTransport(portName=\"helloPort\", contextPath=\"hello\", serviceUri=\"SimpleImpl\") The URL to get view the WSDL of the Web Service, assuming the service is running on a host called ariel at the default",
