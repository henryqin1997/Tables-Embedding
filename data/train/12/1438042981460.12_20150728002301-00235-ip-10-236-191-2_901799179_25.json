It is all you can eat buffet, however, severely over or under cooked food, particularly chicken, is a daily occurrence. Food in the University Center is very good, however, it is expensive. Drumlin Hall and P-Street Cafe have similar food which is OK but selection is either a burger or sub, everyday. Drumlin Hall is closed for the 2012-2013 school year. Only eat at Esker Hall on their occasional steak and shrimp nights as it is cooked right., 208029=UW-Whitewater is in the process of re-opening one of the main dining halls; the tenative date of opening is February 28th. The quality of the other dining halls on campus is good. We have a lot of options that range from pasta to pizza! We have a couple well known restaurants on campus such as Unos and Erberts & Gerberts. We also have a few sandwich shops and a buffet as well., 312411=Dorm food is nice because it's easy to not have to try to figure out dinner on your own, but it can be a little gross sometimes. Drumlin was just renovated in 2013, so it's pretty nice and tastes okay from what I've had. Esker is low-quality food, but you get a lot of it. Erbs and Gerbs is always busy and frequently runs out of ingredients. P-Street is pretty good depending on what you get. The UC has a lot of good food but doesn't cover it in the meal plans for the most part.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Bang for the buck Whitewater is one of the cheapest all around university schools in Wisconsin. You get the most for your money and it is very well spent. The meal plans are one of the cheapest and you get so many choices to choose from. The tuition is one of the lowest as well. Whitewater provides so many opportunities for the students like complex parties, comedians, or live bands which are all under $5 if not free. Am enjoying being here I thoroughly enjoy being here. My fellow peers are always around for help with my homework or just to be there as a friend. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. I've always found something to do with my time, whether it be bowling, pool, air hockey, or just hanging out with my friends. There's no place I'd rather be. Am learning a lot At Whitewater, I have learned many things in each of my classes that I truly believe I can actually carry with me for the rest of my life. The classes I've taken for my major have helped me to learn what I need to learn in order to be",
