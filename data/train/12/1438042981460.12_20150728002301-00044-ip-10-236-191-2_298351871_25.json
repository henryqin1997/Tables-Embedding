IUPAC nomenclature began in 1892 when an international assembly of Chemists met in Geneva, Switzerland, to try to come up with a rational system for naming organic molecules. The rules for naming organic compounds are still being developed. The most recent document for referral is \"Preferred names in the nomenclature of organic compounds\" (Draft 7 October 2004). This document supercedes 'Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, 1979 Edition' and 'A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds, Recommendations 1993'. The current document recognises that there is more than one way to systematically name organic compounds, and develops rules for assigning \"preferred IUPAC names\", but any other name, as long as it is unambiguous and follows the principles of the IUPAC recommendations is acceptable as a \"general IUPAC name\". As a result, there are examples of \"preferred IUPAC\" names that are based on the tradition of use, rather than a system of naming. Examples of these traditional names that students may be expected to know are acetone, acetic acid and its derivatives such as ethyl acetate and acetic anhydride, formic acid and its derivatives such as ethyl formate.}",
