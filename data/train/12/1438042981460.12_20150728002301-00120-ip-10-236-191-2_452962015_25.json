The chart indicates that investors revised up their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate over the intermeeting period, particularly at longer horizons. The expected funds rate paths are estimated from federal funds and Eurodollar futures, with an allowance for term premiums and other adjustments., 313669=e - Staff estimate based on data through mid-June.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table, 311050=e - Staff estimate based on data through May.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table, 698971=A bar chart shows the distribution of primary dealers' forecasts for the level of the federal funds at the end of 2007 as reported in the May and June FRBNY desk primary dealers' survey. Relative to the distribution reported in the May survey, primary dealer forecasts submitted in June shifted to the right (toward higher rates) and become more tightly centered around a funds rate level of 5.25 percent., 73421=A line chart shows the path of sales of existing and new homes since 1999. Each line shows a similar path, with a rise to a peak in summer 2005, before decreasing, at times sharply, by June 2007. New homes sales begin around 880,000 in 1999, peak at 1.39 million in July 2005, and fall to 790,000 by June 2007. Existing home sales were 4.68 million in January 1999, peak at 6.34 million in September 2005, and are back to around 5 million in June 2007. Sales are expected to move a little lower over the next few months, but then stabilize and begin to edge up by year-end 2007 and through 2008., 660885=Central tendencies and ranges of economic projections for years 2007 through 2009. Actual data for years 2002 through 2006, as estimated from the charts., 712484=A line chart shows the monthly supply of new homes (millions of units, annual rate) using a two-quarter moving average of sales. The data cover 2003 through 2008, where 2007:H2 through 2008 is a forecast. The supply of new homes increases from 2003 through mid-year 2007 where it reaches a maximum of 7 million units. From mid-year 2007 through 2008, the supply is forecasted to sharply decline reaching approximately 4.6 million units at the end of 2008., 74178=A line chart shows the estimated error, according to a staff model, of valuation going back to the late 1970s. Overvaluation of single-family housing prices was close to 10 percent in 1980 before falling to a 4 percent undervaluation in 1985. The path moved upward to a slight overvaluation (3.86 percent) in 1989, then fell and remained in the negative from the end of 1990 to 1999:Q2. Overvaluation returned, with a sharp rise throughout the decade, to a peak of around 27 percent in 2006., 704622=A line chart shows the actual real federal funds rate, a range of model-based estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate, and the Greenbook-consistent measure of the equilibrium real funds rate from 1990 to 2007. Shading depicts the range of model-based estimates and also 70 and 90 percent confidence intervals. The actual level of the real federal funds rate is somewhat above the range of model-based estimates of the equilibrium real funds rate but about in line with the Greenbook-consistent measure., 698536=A line chart shows the nominal and inflation indexed Treasury yield curves on 6/26/2007 and on 5/8/2007 (day before the FOMC meeting). Consistent with the upward revision in policy expectations, both the nominal and inflation-indexed yields curves revised up substantially over the intermeeting period., 191792=Note: Ranges defined using data from mid-1996 to mid-2004. 50% range: 2.5-2.9, 80% range: 2.3-3.1, 425974=e - Estimate based on securitizations through June 22.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table, 300512=+ - Observation for Q2 is June 26.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table, 711208=A line chart shows weekly data for the five year forward inflation compensation from 2003 through 2007. The series hovers between 2.4 and 2.8 percent except for a period in 2003 and 2004 where it increases to approximately 3.2 percent. Over recent months, five-year forward inflation compensation has moved noticeably higher relative to levels observed earlier in 2007., 712093=A line chart shows the monthly average for the thirty-year fixed rate mortgage rate from 2003 through 2007. The rate trends slightly upward, remaining between 5.0 and 6.8 percent for the entire period. In recent months, the mortgage rate moved up sharply from about 6-1/4 percent to about 6-3/4 percent., 710575=A line chart shows the ISM (Institute for Supply Management) New Orders Index* and the unemployment rate from 2003 through 2007. The unemployment rate trends downward over the period, falling from approximately 6.0 to 4.5 percent. The ISM New Orders Index trends downward over the rest of the period since 2004 but moved up appreciably over the first half of 2007., 719856=Material for FOMC Briefing on FOMC Communications Vincent R. Reinhart June 28, 2007, 704144=A line chart shows the evolution over time of investors' expectations for the level of the federal funds rate in 2007 Q4. The series dropped sharply earlier in the year but moved higher thereafter and stood a little above 5 percent at the end of June. The Greenbook assumption for the level of the federal funds rate at year end remained at 5.25 percent for every FOMC date over the year., 304366=Note: 2007 data are Q1 preliminary estimates., 699476=A line chart shows three daily time-series of subprime BBB- mortgage CDX index spreads for pools of mortgages originated in 2005:H2, 2006:H1, and 2006:H2. Investors' concerns about the mortgage credit quality are evident in a sharp increase in all three series over the period from September 2006 through June 2007 with a particularly steep increase early in 2007. All three series moved sharply higher again over the period since the May FOMC meeting., 705253=A line chart shows the current and previous FRB/US model simulations of the outcome-based policy rule over the period from 2007 through 2012. Shading depicts the 70 and 90 percent confidence intervals. The estimated prescriptions from the outcome-based rule are relatively stable at around 5 percent through 2009 and then drift lower to about 4 percent in 2012. These estimates are little changed from those in the previous Bluebook., 579309=* Expectations for inflation in years 2013 to 2017.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table, 697550=Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives Vincent Reinhart June 27, 2007, 409175=Note: Subprime 2/28 and 3/27 loans that are securitized and outstanding in March 2007., 289007=* Set of firms approximating the Russell 2000.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table, 705857=A bar chart shows June 26, 2007 (recent) and May 8, 2007 (last FOMC) implied distributions for the federal funds rate six months ahead. The estimates are calculated using options on Eurodollar futures contracts. Both distributions are skewed to the left with the majority of estimates at target rates of 5.00 and 5.25 percent. The distribution for the June meeting has somewhat larger weights on higher interest rate outcomes than for the comparable distribution estimated at the time of the May FOMC meeting., 115821=* 2008 is Q4/Q4; half years are either Q4/Q2 or Q2/Q4.
