The CONVERSIVE is used in conjunction with hypothetical or potential contexts to identify a hypothetical exception to a potential outcome or an actual circumstance which alters or has altered a potential outcome. This translates two different ways into English. Where it indicates an exception to a hypothetical situation, it is translated by the conjunction \u2018unless\u2019 in verbal contexts, and by the preposition \u2018without\u2019 for nouns (note that \u2018without\u2019 in this sense does not correspond to its usual ABESSIVE usage in Sec. 4.5.23 above). If applied to a real or actual situation, it is translatable by such expressions as \u2018but for,\u2019 \u2018if not for,\u2019 \u2018if it wasn\u2019t for,\u2019 or \u2018if it wasn\u2019t on account of.\u2019 Example of usage: Without peace, this society is doomed; If not for the rain, we would have had a good time., 210838=The temporal cases deal with contexts relating to time. In many respects, Ithkuil analyzes time similarly to Western languages, particularly in the ability to spatially compartmentalize time as seen in such English phrases as \u2018in 3 hours,\u2019 \u2018for 5 years,\u2019 \u2018day by day,\u2019 and \u2018per month,\u2019 as well as in analyzing time as progressively linear using concepts such as \u2018before,\u2019 \u2018after,\u2019 \u2018during,\u2019 \u2018until,\u2019 and \u2018ago.\u2019 The fifteen temporal cases are the SIMULTANEITIVE, ASSESSIVE, CONCURSIVE, ACCESSIVE, DIFFUSIVE, PERIODIC, PROLAPSIVE, PRECURSIVE, POSTCURSIVE, ELAPSIVE, ALLAPSIVE, INTERPOLATIVE, EPISODIC, PROLIMITIVE, and LIMITATIVE. Following are explanations of the function and usage of each case. Actual Ithkuil examples of these cases in use are provided in Sec. 4.6.16., 12783=In Sentence (2b) however, Mary entertains the children, there is a subtle distinction. At first we might consider Mary an agent who initiates a change in the children (i.e., the fact that they become entertained). But, in fact, the act of entertainment is not one whose result (enjoyment by the audience) can be guaranteed by the party doing the entertaining. In fact, the result of the act of entertainment is not Mary\u2019s to determine, but rather the children\u2019s, based on whether they \u201cfeel\u201d a sense of enjoyment at experiencing Mary\u2019s act. And so, Mary is more like a patient here, not an agent, as she is undergoing a change in her state or behavior (she is performing an attempt to entertain) which she herself has chosen to initiate and undergo, yet the act has the potential to cause a resulting change in the children, the success of this motivation to be determined by the children, however, not Mary. Such a semantic role as Mary here is termed an ENABLER. And how do the children make the decision as to whether they are entertained or not (i.e., what is their semantic role?). Can the children deliberately or consciously choose to feel a sense of enjoyment, or are they not themselves unwilling \u201cpatients\u201d to their own emotional reactions? In case grammar, a party such as the children who undergo an unwilled experience are termed EXPERIENCERS. Besides emotional reactions, such unwilled experiences include autonomic sensory perceptions (e.g., parties that see or hear because their eyes were open and pointed in a particular direction or who were within earshot of a sound), and autonomic bodily reactions or responses as well as proprioceptive sensations (e.g., coughing, sneezing, perspiring, feeling hot or cold, feeling pain, etc.)., 18946=The grammar of natural languages specifies the requirements of which arguments to a verb must be present for a sentence to be grammatical and which arguments are optional.\u00a0 This is illustrated, for example, in the following English sentences (ungrammatical sentences are preceded by an asterisk):\u00a0, 239459=Also: see Section 4.5.25 above regarding the use of the CORRELATIVE case in sentences involving spatial direction or orientation., 259670=\u00a92004-2011 by John Quijada.

In Ithkuil, however, the case of a noun is based on its underlying semantic role, not its syntactic position in the sentence relative to the verb. These semantic roles reflect a more fundamental or primary level of language irrespective of the surface case marking of nouns in other languages. Thus Ithkuil noun declension more accurately reflects the underlying semantic function of nouns in sentences. Consequently, the Western grammatical notions of \u201csubject\u201d and \u201cobject\u201d have little meaning or applicability in Ithkuil grammar., 45057=Actual Ithkuil examples of these cases in use are provided in Section 4.3.12., 146806=The Associative cases refer to a large group of cases which modify a noun to show that it has some relationship to another, usually adjacent noun or that it functions in an adverbial relationship to a verb. Most of these cases correspond to relationships in which, in English translation, we find two nouns together in apposition or as a compound noun, as in cat box, schoolbook, peace march, mountain man, etc., or joined by the word \u2018of\u2019 in a non-possessive relationship, e.g., box of coins, dreams of youth, sounds of laughter, or as a modifier of a verbal phrase. Following are explanations of the function and usage of each case. Actual Ithkuil examples of the cases in use are given in Sec. 4.5.33 ., 119139=4.3.13 Using Case to Achieve \u201cMiddle Voice\u201d Semantic Effects, 125031=It should be noted that Ithkuil provides an array of suffixes specifically designed to work in conjunction with nouns inflected into one of the Transrelative cases to significantly expand their ability to specify the exact nature of the causal relationships between participants to a verb in an Ithkuil sentence. These suffixes include the Consent CNS suffix, the Reason RSN suffix, the Expectation XPT suffix, the Deliberateness DLB suffix, the Enablement ENB suffix, the Agency/Intent AGN suffix, and the Impact IMP suffix. These affixes are detailed in Section 7.4.12 and discussed further in Section 10.1.2., 63708=The second function of the DERIVATIVE case is to identify the non-agential, unconscious or non-deliberate STIMULUS of an affective mental state, emotion, or autonomic sensory experience, as in The coffee smells good, I saw her today, She hates that boy, Victor coughed from the gas, We laughed at his jokes, That song makes me cry. Ithkuil grammar views the stimulus of an experiential state as having a similar role to that of an abstract circumstantial or situational cause (as in the above examples); this explains why the DERIVATIVE case serves to indicate both functions.}",

The airplane flies beautifully. The engineer increased the pressure. The pressure increased. I molded the soft clay easily. The soft clay molded easily. Note that the second sentence of each pair above is semantically distinct from its passive voice equivalent (i.e., The store was opened at 8 a.m., The airplane is flown beautifully, The pressure was increased, The soft clay was molded easily) in that passives allow for the agent to be overtly stated (using the preposition \u2018by\u2019 in English, as in The store was opened by the",
