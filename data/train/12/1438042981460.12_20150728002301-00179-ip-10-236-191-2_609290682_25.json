    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{19818=Though\u00a0other versions\u00a0of the 1040 G1 exist, HP has not yet aggressively advertised them; they also only had a limited availability in our region at the time of this review. During an extensive price comparison, we discovered other models (H5F64EA, H5F63ET, F1N34EA) featuring the same equipment but with a 256 or 128 GB SSD and/or Full HD screen (IPS? Touch?). A marginally faster\u00a0Intel Core i5-4300U\u00a0(2x 1.9 - 2.9 GHz, TDP: 15 W) and 1920x1080 pixel screen makes the F4X88AW version something special; we did not ascertain any other differences compared with the review sample., 21047=EliteBook is the name of HP's premium-range laptops with a correspondingly premium price. Our HP EliteBook 1040 G1 (H5F62ET) review sample - a lightweight 1.5 kg (~3.3 pounds), 14 incher with a (non-touch) screen resolution of 1600x900 pixels\u00a0- is no exception here.\u00a0At 2000 Euros\u00a0(~$2749), the steep price boosts it into direct competition with the flagship models of other manufacturers. Up to now, it is proclaimed to be the thinnest ultrabook\u00a0that HP has to offer\u00a0with a height of just\u00a015.9 mm (~0.6 inches), and is fully tailored to fit the needs placed on the\u00a0mobile business field\u00a0with its numerous security features. An\u00a0Intel Core i5-4200U\u00a0(2x 1.6 - 2.6 GHz, Hyperthreading, TDP: 15 W, Haswell) alongside the integrated\u00a0Intel HD 4400\u00a0graphics is under the hood, and is supported by 4 GB of RAM. The storage device is a 180 GB SSD from Intel., 9931=We can confirm that HP's EliteBook Folio 1040 G1 had\u00a0excellent Wi-Fi reception qualities\u00a0in the author's personal test setup. The connection has not yet been stably maintained\u00a0with acceptable data rates\u00a0by another laptop over a comparable distance. A constant rate of approximately 1 MB per second was achieved even over three stories of an apartment building through several walls and ceilings when the router was located on the opposite side of the building. That is remarkable., 15091=As a final note, HP also touts the\u00a0robustness\u00a0of its slim business device with the following words: \"The HP EliteBook Folio 1040 passes MIL-STD 810G15 testing for drop, functional shock, vibration, dust, humidity, altitude, high and low temperature, and temperature shock.\" As can be read\u00a0here, this does not necessarily mean anything though., 23087=Towering heights. Someone who offers a 2000 Euro (~$2749) ultrabook is aiming at especially demanding customers. Thus, we ask ourselves why a TN screen is installed in an otherwise very elegant device with some notable cutbacks. Will the review sample nevertheless manage to stand up against the competitor's flagships, and to score in the targeted business range?}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{273012=Great, but unfortunately not a matter of course: The laptop does not consume power when it is turned off. The standby consumption of 0.2 Watts is below average compared with all other laptops in our database, which is agreeably low. When we compare the consumption of the 1040 G1 with current devices of the same size, the review sample sits comfortably\u00a0in the upper third of the ranking\u00a0due to the frugal Haswell CPU. A few contenders based on the same CPU are also found in this field. Now, we will look whether the low power consumption, even for an ultrabook made for portability, leads to an appropriate, long battery runtime. The 45 W power supply's capacity is sufficient., 271825=Both speakers in HP's EliteBook Folio 1040 G1 are concealed underneath a grille below the display, and are touted with \"outstanding audio\" owing to\u00a0DTS StudioSound. Our experience shows that DTS stands instead for mediocrity, and that is exactly what the user gets here. The maximum volume is sufficient to fill an approximately 20 m\u00b2 (~215 sq ft) room with sound, but it is partly accompanied with slight distortions and, depending on the source, volume fluctuations. The playback is clear, and instruments can be discerned well. However, the sound is\u00a0mid-heavy\u00a0and only has punch at this level. Low ranges are represented by clacking noises, and we cannot speak of a surround sound. However, the target group will likely put more value on a\u00a0well-intelligible speech output\u00a0for video conferences, etc. than on music. The review sample's performance is acceptable here., 303421=Note: The HP Folio 1040 has been rated according to the recently introduced ranking system (v4). The total score would have been 85% based on the previous rating system (v3)., 300866=The high-priced 2000 Euro (~$2749) ultrabook is immense, but we can fortunately confirm that HP has not suffered shipwreck with its EliteBook Folio 1040 G1 flagship. We were presented with a\u00a0well-built ultrabook\u00a0from the uppermost price range that does not have to hide in the shadows of its contenders despite a few shortcomings. We still cannot explain why an IPS screen was not used - unlike the competition. Limiting the SSD's capacity to 180 GB also seems a bit stingy. The\u00a0keyboard and touchpad\u00a0of an office device are decisive factors, and the tester believes that they could have been better. However, that is a matter of taste. The input devices did not leave us with a bad impression at all., 16050=As with most laptops featuring a matte and not excessively dark screen, it is possible to work outdoors with HP's EliteBook Folio 1040 G1 (H5F62ET) on sunny days in the right position. That is not always easy, and it is not possible to achieve the same image impression as indoors, which may be a bit stressful for the eyes over a longer period of use. We noticed that this is not as bad in overcast conditions though., 8175=The marginally increased black level of 0.69 cd/m\u00b2, which results from the maximum brightness and the slightly below average contrast of 434:1, corresponds with a subjectively not really dark black reproduction (RGB: 0,0,0). The review sample also does a poor job in color space coverage with 39% of the large AdobeRGB color gamut; but that is only important in (semi) professional image editing. It looks even worse in color accuracy. An average DeltaE rate of 13 (ColorChecker) and 14 (Grayscale) are much too high, and responsible for an intense bluish cast that does not completely disappear even after calibrating. That at least reduces the shift to DeltaE 7 and 12 though. We always provide the corresponding ICC profile\u00a0for download. We must point out that two screens from the same batch can exhibit differences in color reproduction.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The screen does a good job when looking from the sides. Our review sample cannot at all compete with the higher resolution, IPS-based screens of\u00a0Lenovo's X1 Carbon\u00a0or\u00a0Lenovo's T440s. As can be seen in the chart below, the EliteBook just misses first place in the less than decisive accuracy of the gamma rate in this comparison field. In return, the illumination is very homogeneous. We did not observe any bright spots or screen bleeding. Otherwise, the TN screen struggles with the typical problems of this technology, such as\u00a0viewing angle dependency\u00a0and poor contrasts. However, the author believes that the screen in the review sample fares better than that of many TN-based contenders. The usual milky image impression sets in when looking from above, and a kind of inverting effect is seen soon when looking from below. However, the deterioration is limited to a loss in contrast and brightness while color reproduction remains largely unaffected from the sides. As mentioned in the intro, HP did not hesitate installing a\u00a0TN screen\u00a0from",
