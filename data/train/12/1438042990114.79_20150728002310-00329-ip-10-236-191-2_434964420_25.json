            "Freestanding Selectable Free Weight Assembly - This freestanding selectable free weight assembly includes an annular handle assembly that supports a weight set about each end. Each weight set includes end wedge assemblies with slanted interior faces and a set of slanted weight plates are sandwiched between the inner and outer slanted end wedge assemblies. Selectively movable rods are housed within the annular handle assembly. The user can actuate the movable rods to move underneath and support a defined number of weight plates to control the amount of weight disposed about each end of the handle. The weight plates are interconnected by a tang projecting to the side of each plate where each tang is adjacent to a locking slot. Each tang fits into a locking slot of each adjacent weight plate.",
            "Freestanding Selectable Free Weight Assembly - An adjustable weight set apparatus includes a handle having a first end portion and a second end portion opposite the first end portion. A first weight set is adapted to be supported on the first end portion of the handle and a second weight set is adapted to be supported on the second end portion of the handle. Each of the first and second weight sets includes a plurality of weight plates. An adjustment assembly is mounted on the handle and includes a single selector element and a pair of selectors positioned for engaging and retaining the weight plates to the handle. The selectors are operatively connected to the selector element such that movement of the single selector element causes movement of both selectors for engaging and retaining the weight plates of the first and second weight sets to the handle."
