(The default threshold for the LOVOTE event is 1.)  The Cluster Members pane (bottom) displays detailed information about   each node in the cluster, including its System Communication Architecture (SCA) connections with other nodes. The Summary pane (top) displays summary information about the entire cluster.    The two panes in the Cluster Summary page display the following information:   LAN Displays When you monitor OpenVMS Version 7.3 and later nodes with managed objects enabled, additional cluster data and fixes are available for LAN virtual circuits. This data includes enhanced LAN virtual circuit summary data in the Cluster Summary window and the LAN Virtual Circuit Details (NISCA) window. In addition, the Cluster Summary includes virtual circuit, channel, and device fixes.
