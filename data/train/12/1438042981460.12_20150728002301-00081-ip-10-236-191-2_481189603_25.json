No. 880,125, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Designing and Distributing Customized Electronic Billing Statements\u201d. This application was filed Jun. 19, 1997 in the names of Howard Campbell, Warren T. Dent, Eric Jakstadt, Darren B. Remington, Bassam Saliba, Bert Speelpenning, George Webb, and is assigned to Microsoft Corporation. This application is incorporated by reference., 67359=At this point, the billing operator may wish to preview the billing statements prior to allowing the service center to disburse them electronically. The statements contain the newest billing data integrated into the template to create the final bills. The billing operator can preview a statistically-significant sample of the bills as they will appear to the consumer. Once the billing operator has approved the statements, the operator sends over an activation command authorizing release of the billing statements. Entry 110 reflects that the status of the Dec. 1, 1997 batch has been upgraded to \u201cActivate\u201d. Active statements can be disbursed electronically to the consumers or posted to the Web site., 37420=There is a prior art electronic bill payment system, however, that mentions the possibility of electronic bill distribution. This system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,206, entitled \u201cElectronic Bill Pay System,\u201d which issued Nov. 7, 1995 and is assigned to Visa International. The Visa bill payment system permits bills to be sent to consumers via U.S. mail or email. Unfortunately, the system is limited in that the email message containing the bill must conform to requirements imposed by Visa. The requirements stem from the need to route remittance information back to the biller through the VisaNet\ufffd network. The biller has little or no control over the format concerning how the bill is presented to the consumer, but must instead accommodate a format compatible with the VisaNet\ufffd network. While it may be possible for the biller and biller bank to agree on some aspects of the billing format, the biller cannot independently control the format., 53576=The service center delivers the billing statements in one of two ways. One way is to directly distribute the billing statements to the consumers over the network 32 (i.e., Internet), as illustrated by the communication paths to consumers 28(3) and 28(L). The billing statements can be embedded in an email message or a notice. A direct distribution system is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/734,518, entitled \u201cElectronic Bill Presentment and Payment System\u201d, which was filed Oct. 18, 1996 in the names of Darren Remington and Warren Dent, and is assigned to Microsoft Corporation. This application is incorporated by reference., 66635=At the end of the billing cycle, the biller batches together the billing data for its consumers and sends it across the network to the service center 24. This billing data is then sent separately to the service center, which then creates billing statements from the data and the template, rules, and resources that are already on file at the service center. Entry 106 indicates that the batch of billing data for the period ending Dec. 1, 1997 is located at the biller and is currently being packaged and sent to the service center. A subsequent entry 108 informs the operator that the Dec. 1, 1997 batch has been received at the service center and is being loaded into the database., 58610=The consumer can elect to pay the bill electronically, as well. The payment phase of the billing system, as well as the settlement phase, are not discussed in this document. An entire electronic billing system is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/734,518, entitled \u201cElectronic Bill Presentment and Payment System\u201d, which was filed Oct. 18, 1996 in the names of Darren Remington and Warren Dent, and is assigned to Microsoft Corporation. This application is incorporated by reference., 78383=The resource table 204 coordinates the resources that are to be included in the batch of billing statements. The resource table 204 includes such data fields as a biller ID, a batch ID, a resource ID to identify the particular resource (e.g., a \u201crepair\u201d control or discount offering), and resource value that specifies an amount level at which the resource should be offered to a consumer. As an example, the biller might stipulate to include a resource that offers a discounted cruise to any consumer who routinely spends $2000 per month., 220584=When a notification arrives, the management console asks for a parcel object for the changed parcel and updates the UI screen based on the state of the parcel and its contents. More particularly, the management console module adds a new entry to the list (such as entries 104-112 in FIG. 4) reflecting the location and status of a particular parcel and its contents. FIG. 4 illustrates three entries 106, 108, and 110 for the same parcel #6407, which reflects different locations and statuses of the parcel. The first two entries 106 and 108 result from the steps in the parcel transfer process. Entry 106, which indicates that the biller is sending the parcel containing the Dec. 1, 1997 batch to the service center, is generated as a result of step 252. Entry 108, which reflects that the parcel has been processed and loaded in the service center database, might be the result of a notification sent out during step 256.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described in language specific to structural features and/or methodological steps, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or steps described. Rather, the specific features and steps are disclosed as exemplary forms of implementing the claimed invention. Other tasks in addition to handling the template and billing data include processing the payment receipt and exchanging consumer information (e.g., new registration, change of address, etc.). These tasks function similarly in that the BIS or service center create parcel objects and use the parcel manager to exchange the information. For each separate task, however, the BIS calls into the parcel manager using a handler for that task, such as the consumer information handler 136 and the payment handler 138. The BIS gateway assigns a batch ID to the statement batch and a statement ID to each statement in the batch (step 298). The statement data translator 28 calls via the batch handler 140 into the parcel manager interface 224 to create a statement batch parcel (step 300). The batch parcel contains the following information: biller ID, batch ID, template ID, template rule ID, resource table records, statement table records, and industry table records. The batch parcel is sent to the service center during the next connection with the service center (step 302). The service center processes the batch parcel and",
