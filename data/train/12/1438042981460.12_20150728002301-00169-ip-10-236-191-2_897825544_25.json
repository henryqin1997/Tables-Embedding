            "There are public safety officers positioned in the dormitories 24 hours and in each building on campus during open hours. The school has a pretty safe atmosphere even though it is located in the middle of a city.",
            "There is no Greek life on the Worcester campus.",
            "There are many activities sponsored by the school throughout the semester as well as off campus activities.",
            "There is only one cafe that is not on the main campus. It has a very limited selection and high prices.",
            "The school does a good job in creating a comfortable living environment for students who live on campus. The dormitories are nice and there are different options.",
            "The greatest challenge in the program is the amount of time that must be devoted to studying, this includes most evenings and weekends.",
            "I think this program is ideal for students who already have a high level of education in the sciences, such a PhD or a Master's. The most successful students in this program are those who already have a firm background in pathophysiology, medicinal chemistry and biochemistry.",
            "The three year accelerated pharmacy program on the Worcester campus is an intense, fast-paced program. It integrates pharmacy practice rotations throughout the curriculum so you can get a feel for what a pharmacy career will be like while you're still in school. It is a challenging program and is a good fit for highly motivated students."

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Everyone, despite whether it's just being a MCPHS student or a student at another school will not like their school the first, I don't know, days, weeks, months, whatever. As a nursing student, I was shocked I got accepted to MCPHS vs. other schools I've applied for. I still dislike the system at the school but I know, once I graduate, I will definitely have a better chance of getting a job because of my clinical experience and my connections. Am learning a lot Learning how much and what material really depends on the professors. Some professors would be very laid back and just gives easy quizzes, assignments, etc. Professors who fall into this category might be there to just get the salary without putting much effort or care in whether or not students will pass the class. They also tend to be the ones that have many things to do so they give everyone a B or A just to make things easier. Other professors really get you to critically think or give supposedly unfair rules. Despite the enormous load of papers to grade or exams to make, they really are there to enlighten the students. They want the best for the students. They actually pay attention to the students' needs and concerns and addresses it. You don't have many",
