A conventional-type CD player (also not shown) suitably connected to the Mario chip 2 to receive memory address signals over address bus P2\u2013P26 for accessing data and/or instructions over data bus P28\u2013P35. The specific structural and operational details of CD players and CD ROM storage systems are well known to those skilled in the art. One advantage provided by CD ROM storage is a significant reduction in the cost of storage per byte of information. Data may be stored at a cost between 100 to 1000 percent less than storage on semiconductor ROM. Unfortunately, the memory access/read time for CD ROM is even slower than that for semiconductor ROM.}",

While the foregoing embodiment is considered to be an preferred embodiment, it should be understood that numerous variations and modifications may be made therein by those skilled in art and is intended that the following claims cover such variations and modifications within the spirit and scope of the present invention. . The graphics coprocessor of the present invention may be used to generate 3D type (and other) special effects including those involving rotated and scaled polygon-based objects at high speed, while only minimally burdening the host video game processing system. FIG. 19 show enlarged and rotated views of the helicopter set forth in FIGS. 20 and 21 , the side view of an object ie., a helicopter, is portrayed. This figure is not intended to accurately reflect the high quality display that can be generated by using the Mario chip. FIG. 19 , 20, and 21 exemplify some of the special effects which may be generated while using the programmable graphics coprocessor of the present invention in combination with the host computer system e.g., the Super NES.
