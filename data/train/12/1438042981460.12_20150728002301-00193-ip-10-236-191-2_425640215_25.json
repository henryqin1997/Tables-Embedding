They\ufffdll be giving their all for those that didn\ufffdt make the cut. As Jacks\ufffd coach Luke Hodgson looked over his 2013 squad he was very pleased with what he saw. In fact, Hodgson was cautiously optimistic as he pointed out that this squad had a wealth of talent that was similar to the 2007 NT team that blazed to the NFL title with a spotless 14-0 league mark. But along the way, Hodgson had to make some tough choices by cutting a few players. It\ufffds something he didn\ufffdt want to have to do.\u00a0 For that reason, Hodgson is telling his team the perfect way to honor those who did and didn\ufffdt make the team, is making the most of your chance to play. \ufffdThis was one of the few years that we had to make cuts. And those guys that were cut they could all play,\ufffd Hodgson explained. \ufffdA lot of guys were from last year.\u00a0 \ufffdI just kind of said the guys who are here now, you owe it to the guys who got cut to perform at your utmost,\ufffd he added. \ufffdYou can\ufffdt complain about being tired. You can\ufffdt complain about being bored. You\ufffdre here to win. And if you\ufffdre not, there are guys that would be more than happy to switch spots with you.\ufffd Seeing teammates from last year\ufffds squad not make the roster this year has driven home the message to every player that no one\ufffds spot is secure. And it\ufffds about keeping up effort and attitude. \ufffdWe all realize that could be us,\ufffd Donovan Book said. \ufffdIf we don\ufffdt put in the effort, we could be cut. So everyday we\ufffdre just working as hard as we can.\ufffd Hodgson said the increased interest in varsity goes hand-in-hand with the growth of the junior varsity and modified programs. The Jacks are built with a core of veterans in seniors Joe Piotrowski, Ryan Fritz, Brandon Lavocat and Max McCabe, as well as juniors Donovan Book and Sam Weglarski. Depth and versatility are working in the Jacks\ufffd favor as Hodgson feels his players can be slotted into various roles and that his top seven or eight guys are all capable of starting. Another plus of the depth is that it has sparked a fire under every player every single day because players know that just one moment of slacking off or a half effort could cost them playing time.\u00a0 So the Jacks walk into the gym every day ready to give their best and draw the best out of each other. \ufffdIt has [worked] already,\ufffd Hodgson said. \ufffdI haven\ufffdt seen this kind of hustle in a very long time, which is good.\ufffd From an X\ufffds and O\ufffds perspective, Hodgson said the increased tempo in practice allows them to work on more game-related situations, as opposed to reverting back to the re-teaching of basics. \ufffdIt\ufffds great knowing we\ufffdre all together on the team,\ufffd Book said. \ufffdWe\ufffdre all working hard, helping each other out. We\ufffdre all friends on the team. We all work together. I think we\ufffdll work great together, as a whole.\ufffd Joseph Karl, Zach Krisnosky, James Davignon, Griffin Spatorico, Victor Willison, Damian Brady, Michael Awad, Robert Johnson and Kyle Brady complete NT\ufffds opening day roster.\u00a0 NT hosted its annual tournament on Sept. 7., 113832=Fall varsity sports teams earn scholar athlete status\u00a0 Clarence Bee Wednesday, January 22, 2014, 378254=2013 Fab 50 Volleyball Magazine October, 2013, 364477=St Joe's Outlasts St Mary's Buffalo News Wednesday October 30, 2013, 481617=Team 12th Grand Island Tournament Finals Wmsv.

The Billies, ranked eighth in Western New York large schools, lost only one game in pool play on their way to winning the inaugural Maryvale Tournament Aug. 31 and recorded non-league victories against Amherst, 25-13, 25-11, 25-12, Sept. 3 and fourth-ranked large school Lockport, 29-27, 26-24, 25-17, last Wednesday. \ufffdAfter the Lockport match, I asked the Lockport coach how you think we can stack up with other teams and he said that we can compete with anybody,\ufffd South coach Thom Knab said. \ufffdIt\ufffds up to us. We have to perform on the court.\ufffd Knab credits a lot of the early season success due to the experience of the returning players, led by 6-foot senior captains Anthony Podgorsak and Steve Zaprowski. Podgorsak, a four-year starter, is a returning All-Western New York Second Team outside hitter who led the Billies in kills last season. Podgorsak was named to the All-Tournament Team at the Maryvale Tournament. Zaprowski is a returning ECIC II First Team outside hitter who was originally brought up during his freshman year. Knab said both have developed into incredible serve-receivers, provide a good attack and use their experience to cover the court.\u00a0 Other returning league all-stars include 6-foot-3 junior middle hitter Christian Graziano (ECIC II Second Team, led team in blocks last season, named to All-Tournament Team of Maryvale Tournament) and 6-foot sophomore setter Joe Zanelotti (ECIC II First Team). Knab said Zanelotti is developing into a mature player, makes good decisions and places the ball well for teammates. He recorded 78 assists to garner MVP honors at the Maryvale Tournament. South beat Grand Island, 25-17, 25-19, in the tournament final. Seniors Kenny Stuber and Austin Collins are sharing playing time at libero. Other starters include seniors Austin Baker (middle hitter) and junior Ryan Nigro (right side hitter). Rounding out the team are seniors Will Atkinson (middle hitter) and Barrett Lacey (outside hitter), juniors Brendan Bratton (middle hitter), Braedan Gillman (right side), Paul Jager (outside hitter), and Tyler Langl (outside hitter), and sophomore Shawn Barbalato (middle hitter)., 596262=Team Finals Hamburg 23-25-15, Clarence 25-21-10 Semis Clarence 25-25, St. Mary's 21,16 Hamburg 25-25, Lancaster 19-21 Quarterfinals St. Mary's 25-21-15, Sweet Home 21-25-6 Lancaster 25-25, Wmsv.

Kus began her teaching career at Sweet Home in 1970 and shortly thereafter was called upon to coach girls volleyball. With a background in field hockey and basketball, she initially resisted and only reluctantly acquiesced. This decision to become coach turned into the most remarkable success story in Western New York scholastic sports history. During the next 23 years, Kus\ufffd Lady Panthers compiled a staggering record of 792 wins and 29 losses. Those wins were the foundation for 15 consecutive Far West Regional titles, 20 consecutive Section VI Class A titles and the first six Western New York State Championships awarded (1990-1995). In 1996, Volleyball Magazine recognized the Sweet Home program as the nation\ufffds best in the sport\ufffds 100-year history. The single most memorable accomplishment of Kus\ufffd squads was undoubtedly the 292-match winning streak that spanned eight undefeated campaigns from 1978 to 1987. Kus was the first coach of the Empire State Games team in 1978 and was recognized as the Regional, New York State and National Coach of the Year in 1987. She received the inaugural Medallion of Merit from the National Volleyball Hall of Fame in 1996 and was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.\u00a0 Her focus has always been more attuned to the girls she coached rather than personal accolades, and she is most proud of the more than 70 full athletic scholarships awarded to players in the Sweet Home program and the six New York State Scholar-Athlete Teams she has produced.\u00a0, 203673=Others Receiving Votes and appearing on two or more ballots: Pacific 24; Ball State 17; Harvard 14; Princeton 11; UC San Diego 5.

The main considerations included not only skill, but also leadership and the ability to have a large impact on their teams and in matches. Read on to learn a little more about these players.\u00a0 Micah Christenson\u00a0 So. | S | 6'5\" | Southern California (Honolulu, Hawaii) While only a sophomore, Christenson is heralded by many coaches as the best setter in the country. Last year\ufffds VBM Freshman of the Year and a Second-Team All-American, Christenson led the Trojans to the NCAA Title match in his first season. Six of his hitters recorded more than 100 kills for the season, including three who hit better than .300, and he directed the squad to a .297 hitting percentage. He picked up 29 kills for himself to go along with 12 aces, 173 digs, and 76 blocks. He led the squad to better than a .300 hitting percentage on 14 occasions. Taylor Sander\u00a0 Jr. | OH | 6'4\" | BYU (Huntington Beach, Calif.) A two-time First Team All-MPSF selection, Sander was called the best player in the country by several coaches. He led the squad in 2012 with 435 kills, good for an average of 4.89 kills per set on a .395 hitting percentage \ufffd both marks that ranked second in the nation. He posted a team-high 44 aces and ranked fourth on the squad with 120 digs while also collecting 69 blocks. And he racked up all of these numbers while missing six weeks of action due to an injury to his right hand. Sander posted 12 matches with 20 or more kills for BYU and also saw action this summer with the U.S. Men\ufffds National team, being named the Most Valuable Player at the Pan American Cup in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Kevin Tillie\u00a0 Sr. | OH | 6'6\" | UC Irvine (Cagnus-sur-Mer, France) As one coach said, \ufffdIrvine is going to be good because they still have Tillie.\ufffd The senior, who started his career at Thompson Rivers University in Canada and was a member of the French Junior National Team, ranked second on the Anteater squad last season in kills with 342 (3.80 kills per set) on .387 hitting, which ranked him third nationally. He was named to the MPSF and NCAA All-Tournament teams, aided by his 21 kills on .500 hitting in the NCAA semifinal win over Penn State. He recorded double-digit kill numbers on 20 occasions, including a career-high 24 against Stanford in the MPSF Final.

The Falcons survived a close four-game match on Saturday to beat West Seneca West in a Class A semifinal. Erik Hatten had 24 kills while Jake Gleason handed out 46 assists. Tom Stoklosa added nine kills and four blocks. The Indians were the No. 1 seed and during the regular season shared the ECIC I title with Hamburg. The Falcons won the title in 2010 and 2011, but lost to Orchard Park year. Frontier was the No. 5 seed after a 5-7 finish in ECIC I.\u00a0 \ufffdWe faced a lot of adversity and had some injury issues. I don\ufffdt think our record reflects who we are and how gritty of a team we have,\ufffd said coach Bill Faust. Senior outside hitter Dylan Durni has had a strong year despite missing 3-4 weeks with a bad back. The Falcons have also had to deal with the loss of starting libero Peter Lotocki to a season-ending broken thumb. The last two matches Frontier has started a freshman at libero, Zach Gerken. In the other Class A semifinal, Lockport beat Clarence in three games. The Lions needed a 29-27 score in the second game to complete the sweep. Frontier (9-12) and Lockport will play for the Class A title on Wednesday at 6 p.m. at Hamburg. Lockport won the NFL title this season with a 12-0 record. \ufffdLockport is very tall, very athletic. We\ufffdll have to do a couple things well to get them out of their system,\ufffd said Faust.\u00a0 Class B: Hamburg advanced in three games, beating Grand Island, 25-21, 25-16, 25-15 in the semifinals. Trevor Vail had four aces and Ryan Dils 25 assists for the winners. Williamsville South came back after losing the first game 25-23, and took the next three to beat Eden in the other semi. Anthony Podgorsak had 21 kills and Joe Zanelotti 44 assists for the Billies (24-2). Eden went 12-0 to win ECIC III. The Bulldogs will play Williamsville South for the title on Wednesday at 8 p.m. Hamburg is the No. 1 school in the WNY Coaches poll. South went 12-0 this season to win ECIC II., 371155=At 4-8 in ECIC II action, the Starpoint boys volleyball team hasn\ufffdt had the smoothest of seasons. It still has a fighting chance at redemption, though. Despite having what head coach Kirk Spitler called a \ufffddown year,\ufffd the Spartans will have a crack at postseason play when they participate in a home sectional qualifier match against an opponent yet to be determined at press time. \ufffdHopefully we win the first [qualifier] game,\ufffd Spitler said. \ufffdWe\ufffdd end up facing a top four team if we win, but as a program, that\ufffds how you learn. You get thrown to the dogs in that first round and if you want to get out of it, you have to work harder.\ufffd Just as they have all season, the Spartans will lean on setter Brett Kane to lead them through sectionals. Kane does it all for the Spartans \ufffd and he does it all very well. The senior co-captain has played under Spitler since the end of his freshman season and has become the team\ufffds best player over time. \ufffdHe is a competitor to the nth degree,\ufffd Spitler said. \ufffdThere are athletes and there are participants; he is an athlete, big time.\ufffd Despite being depended on as a primary source of offense, Kane leads the team in solo blocks with 36 \ufffd a testament to the do-it-all nature of his game. He also has a gaudy 89 kills and a .559 hitting percentage. His 307 assists rank first on the team; his 32 digs, third. \ufffdHe has just been a threat,\ufffd Spitler said before noting that Kane has a chance to play collegiately. \ufffdHe plays bigger than he is. Any team that takes him lightly is surprised. He doesn\ufffdt jump out of the gym but he is just a competitor. And he always pushes himself to get better.\ufffd Spitler said that Kane\ufffds play lifts his teammates and that he and his co-captain, Ryan Schwab, have done a good job in helping to lead the inexperienced squad. Schwab, a 5-foot-6 outside hitter, leads the team with 44 digs and 43 service aces.\u00a0 \ufffdRyan is a good jumper and a gamer,\ufffd Spitler said. \ufffdHe had a pretty bad ankle sprain against Sweet Home [on Oct. 11]. He didn\ufffdt want to sit out. When he gets in the game, he doesn\ufffdt want to come out.\ufffd Manning the outside position opposite Schwab is Travis Krupinski, a junior. He leads the team in kills with 104. Senior Jeremy Tock is also a key hitter on the outside. Junior Dennis Held and senior Ben Chatley start in the middle. Junior libero Tyler Puchlerz\ufffds 42 digs rank second on the team. Ryan Rydza, a senior who didn\ufffdt make the squad when he tried out as an eleventh grader, has become one of Spitler\ufffds go-to passers this year. Spiter noted that the Spartans\ufffd issues this season have stemmed from an inability to put teams away when they\ufffdre at their most vulnerable.\u00a0 He specifically cited the team\ufffds Oct. 18 match at defending Class B champion Lake Shore as an example. The Spartans led in all three games but failed to win any of them, falling 21-25, 23-25 and 23-25.\u00a0 \ufffdWe\ufffdve been very competitive with good teams,\ufffd he said. \ufffdWe just don\ufffdt seem to have that ability to put them down. We don\ufffdt know how to finish them off.\ufffd The Spartans hope they will have learned come Monday. \ufffdWe\ufffdre optimistic, if nothing else,\ufffd Spitler said. \ufffdI\ufffdve got a great group of guys who deserve it. They\ufffdre just good, classy guys.\ufffd\u00a0, 582454=In the first three weeks of voting in the Western New York Coaches Boys Volleyball Poll, there have been three different teams ranked No. 1. Of the six tournaments that have been reported to The News, there have been six different champions. If you\ufffdre getting the idea the talent is widespread this season, you\ufffdd be as accurate as an ace landing in the middle of the floor. \ufffdI\ufffdm not surprised. It\ufffds parity, but not in the sense of mediocrity,\ufffd said Clarence coach Kevin Starr. \ufffdThere are some really, really good teams. All of us coaches expected going into the season it was going to be like this. It\ufffds so cool to see so many really solid teams. I don\ufffdt know if it\ufffds this way in other sports, but we\ufffdre all enjoying this season so much. A lot of us coach other teams\ufffd kids in club season. In 34 years I\ufffdve never seen it like this.\ufffd Looking to repeat Canisius senior Brian Costello is generally acknowledged as the best setter in WNY. He\ufffds the only returning All-Western New York player. Last year he set the Crusaders to a 24-5 overall record and a 9-1 league mark. Canisius won the Monsignor Martin Association playoff championship for the 13th consecutive year and tied for the regular season championship with St. Joe\ufffds.\u00a0 Canisius junior Trevor Gooch was first team All-Catholic last year and MVP of this year\ufffds Hamburg Tournament. It took three years of state tournaments in boys volleyball before Lake Shore broke through in 2012 as the first team to qualify from Section VI. The Eagles lost the final in three games to Bellmore of Section VIII, ending a memorable 21-4 season. Plenty of talent returns, including one player with a bright future, freshman Devin Joslyn, an all-around talent. Helping run the offense has been sophomore Kyle Wishman. Senior Brad Owens is being counted on for his play at libero and for being a leader on a young team. Defending Section VI Class A champion Orchard Park graduated most of its starters from last year\ufffds 22-4 team.\u00a0 Two starters this year know what it\ufffds like to be a state champion. Nolan McArdle and Brian Manley were on the Quakers\ufffd state champion relay team in swimming last winter. On land, McArdle is one of the top setters in WNY. OP is off to its slowest start since 1977, but expects the improvement the team is making will surface in October. Jeff Biddle made his season debut on Monday after missing the start of the year with a broken foot. Quick sets Hamburg is riding a wave of confidence after winning Saturday\ufffds Sweet Home Tournament and starting the season 3-0 in ECIC I. Tournament MVP Patrick Stroh and Doug Horbachewski were ECIC I all-stars a year ago. Stroh is a dynamic left side and a very good jumper. Horbachewski can play all three of the front row spots. Sophomore setter Ryan Dils is a three-sport athlete who makes the Bulldogs go. Trevor Vail is a very physical rightside, who also plays club rugby. Zach Yerington was all-tourney at Clarence and Sweet Home. When one Hamburg starter missed the Sweet Home Tournament due to illness, Tom Hoff, the team\ufffds third middle and a blocking specialist, took advantage of the chance to prove himself. Coach Brian Carroll said the team elevated its play down a man and became a better team. \ufffdIt was really good to win down a man, we showed our team can still function, the kids who came in left the day confident about themselves,\ufffd he said., 246246=Lainy Pierce said that she wanted to keep her options open in the process of selecting a college, but when it came right down to it, Penn State had too tight of a grip on the Eden High School senior \ufffd for good reason. Not only is Penn State one of the more prestigious universities in the nation, but it is also the place her father, Robert, played men\ufffds volleyball; her mother, Kiernan, competed in track and field and her sister, Kendall, is currently a sophomore on the women\ufffds volleyball team. The women\ufffds volleyball team also continues to be a contender for the NCAA national championship, having won titles four straight years (2007 \ufffd 2010) and returned back to the Final Four last season. Lainy, who had verbally committed to Penn State last year, made her decision official on Nov. 15, as she signed her letter of intent at Eden High School, before jumping on the bus with her Raiders teammates, to play in the state tournament in Glens Falls during the weekend. \ufffdMy parents and family were good about helping me keep my options open and not wanting me to feel too much pressure, but ultimately when I would discuss pros and cons of my top schools, it always came back to Penn State. Everything got compared to Penn State,\ufffd Lainy said. \ufffdMaybe it was because it was the first school I started looking at and I started looking at it from such a young age, and that might be from my parent\ufffds influence. But whenever I thought of college, I\ufffdve always thought of Penn State. It was hard for me to get out of that, but I\ufffdm glad I didn\ufffdt.\ufffd It wasn\ufffdt just family ties that made the decision. If she wanted to play at the highest level and challenge herself academically, the athlete said she figured: What better place? \ufffdKendall and Lainy both understand that hard work does pay off and have had their eyes on the prize for a while now,\ufffd her father, Robert Pierce, said. \ufffdYes, they\ufffdve been smart enough to look at other options. We\ufffdve taken them on visits, to say, \ufffdLook at this, look at this,\ufffd but I think when they look at the whole big picture \ufffd family, volleyball and academics \ufffd having the opportunity to go to a university like this and play for national championship contender every year, it was a home run.\ufffd Pierce, also the coach of Eden\ufffds boys volleyball team, has already watched as Kendall Pierce earned her scholarship as a Penn State walk-on, and now he gets to see as his other daughter continue a family legacy at the university. Lainy Pierce was given some scholarship money, with the chance to win further scholarship awards. \ufffdI never thought it would come to complete fruition, for both of them; I hoped it would ... it\ufffds a dream,\ufffd Robert Pierce said. \ufffdWe couldn\ufffdt be happier with Lainy\ufffds choice. Penn State is rated a top 50 university in the world, and the resources afforded a student-athlete there are incredible, far more than when my wife and I went there. There placement and connection with alumni, academically, is top notch, facilities are top of the line ... and, to me, it\ufffds one of the best coaching staffs around.\ufffd\u00a0 The decision brings a reunion between Lainy and Kendall Pierce as teammates. While at Eden, the two helped the Raiders to three straight state titles, a mark that was extended to five during the weekend, where Lainy Pierce won her second straight Most Valuable Player Award at states. Kendall Pierce had won it as a senior in 2011. \ufffdMy sister was super thrilled when she heard I committed to Penn State,\ufffd Lainy Pierce said. \ufffdShe was bouncing off the walls. She wants to play with me again and I want to play with her again, because we had so much fun, but also it will be nice to be able to support each other at school.\ufffd Originally looked at as a future libero at Penn State, playing as a setter at a state championship level the past two seasons has made Pierce more marketable and may get her on to the floor to compete and help right away at the next level, according to her father. The athlete said she was a little reluctant to the idea of switching to setter at first, but she got used to the role and was willing to take it on, to help her team. She wound up embracing quarterbacking the team and helping others score, after being one of the main scorers herself on past teams she\ufffds played on. \ufffdStephen [Pierce, her uncle and head coach at Eden] talked me into it and said, \ufffdThis is something you have to do for the team,\ufffd\ufffd Lainy Pierce recalled. \ufffdI realized my role was something completely different from sophomore to junior year. I used to have my setter there and my sister as the libero and all they needed me to do was pass, serve and hit the ball, but I realized that I had to step up and truly be a leader. So if it was something I had to do for my team, than I would do it.\ufffd Robert Pierce pointed out that Lainey had an advantage being the younger daughter and able to develop her athletic IQ by watching her older sister and playing up levels with older kids. He noted that this allowed her to mature quicker and be a major contributor for five years with Eden. \ufffdLainy\ufffds been with me for five years and I\ufffdve been able to see all of the growth,\ufffd Stephen Pierce said. \ufffdI\ufffdm proud of the young woman she\ufffds become and the way she\ufffds learned to put an imprint on the team. She\ufffds one of the best pure athletes from this school. She should be the kind of athlete that responds well to the demands of the next level.\ufffd Robert Pierce said that he is happy he and his wife now can make the four \ufffd five-hour trip to see two Pierces playing for Penn State at once. \ufffdWe\ufffdre excited; we can go down there and watch both girls play,\ufffd he said. \ufffdThey\ufffdre trading in the maroon and white for the blue and white, but they\ufffdll always be Raiders. We couldn\ufffdt be happier for them. They worked so hard for this.\ufffd, 116107=AVCA Division I-II Men's Week #3 Poll: January 20, 2014 1/20/14, 137674=Hawaii Warrior Men Volleyball 2014 - #14 Hawaii Vs #12 Ohio State\u00a0 UHVolleyBallFanToo Friday, January 10, 2014, 564757=Bulldogs\ufffd spikers win Sweet Home Tourney By: Michael J.

Throughout the season, Federowicz has been the go-to outside hitter. \ufffdHe is the crucial component to our success,\ufffd said Garbacz. \ufffdHe can always provide a key float serve, a perfect pass, and the attitude the team needs in order to succeed. He is a leader of the team due to his positive and hard working attitude.\ufffd Along with Federowicz is co-captain Nichy who also provides offense as the other outside hitter. Karnyski is the team\ufffds number one middle blocker, and fittingly he leads the Wildcats in blocks on the season. \ufffdHe leads the teams in blocks in the middle, but also leads by example with his strong work ethic, both on and off the court,\ufffd said Garbacz. \ufffdHe is the first one at practice, setting up the net, and making sure the team stays focused during practice.\ufffd Stablewski, who is a three-sport athlete, provides plenty of positive energy during games, which Garbacz said has helped to catalyze some victories. Besides the seniors, Depew has two juniors who also contribute \ufffd Eric Wagner as an outside hitter and Dylan Haak at setter.\u00a0 Wagner frequently puts his body on the line, diving for digs, and is one of the most consistent passers for Depew. \ufffdNothing hits the ground in front of him,\ufffd said Garbacz. While Haak is well-known to hustle all over the court. \ufffdHis hustle and heart allow him to improve with every single practice,\ufffd said Garbacz. \ufffdHe works hard every day, and is an all-around athlete.\ufffd Garbacz herself was an all-around athlete as well. She was a first team all-state volleyball player at Lancaster, and continued her career in college playing Canisius. In addition, she also played softball at Canisius as well. Before taking over Depew, Garbacz coached one year as assistant girls coach at Lancaster in 2010, and the past two years she was the head coach for the varsity girls at Tonawanda.\u00a0, 666722=Lake Shore's Devin Joslyn To Play For USA National 14U Volleyball Team By Kristen, Angola, Brant-Farnham, Derby, Sports Friday, April 26, 2013, 323827=Crosstown rivals playing against each other in a win-or-go-home postseason game is always a match made in Heaven on paper. And, boy, the match did not disappoint. Fifth-seeded Maryvale hosted No. 12 Cheektowaga to open up the boys volleyball Class B playoffs on Tuesday, Oct. 29 and the match went the distance. Ultimately, the Flyers were able to avoid another early playoff exit and used a packed house and loud home crowd to their advantage to defeat the Warriors 3-2 in advancing to the quarterfinals. \ufffdWe talked about just that,\ufffd said Maryvale coach Andy Murtha. \ufffdOne year ago, we were in the same situation. Going into Game Five. I just asked them how bad did they want it.\ufffd Last year, Maryvale earned the fifth-seed and home-court advantage and couldn\ufffdt capitalize against No. 12 North Tonawanda. This year, the game-winning kill came from the hands of Tyler Nosal. Maryvale received the serve up 24-17 as Ryan Robida got control of Wayne Hunzinger\ufffds dig and passed it to Nosal, who was waiting at the outside for a ferocious spike that got in between two Warriors on the block. \ufffdI could just tell it was a really good hit,\ufffd Nosal noted. Maryvale took the first two games, 25-17 and 25-21. But Cheektowaga wasn\ufffdt going to go out that easily, taking the next two games, 25-17 and 25-19, to tie the match up at two wins apiece before the Flyers gained control again in Game Five. \ufffdI feel like we lost some energy and we got a little cocky because we swept them before,\ufffd Jordan Teed said. \ufffdAll the seniors knew that this could potentially be the last game that we played so we wanted to give it everything we had.\ufffd It was an 11-10 match in Maryvale\ufffds advantage before Cheektowaga called timeout inside a gymnasium full of fans on both sides that hadn\ufffdt stopped screaming since the final game began. The next timeout came when Maryvale held a 19-14 advantage, and Cheektowaga just couldn\ufffdt keep up any longer. \ufffdMy seniors stepped up,\ufffd Cheektowaga coach Jon Marcussen said about Tyler Adamczyk, Noah McGhee, Kevin Nguyen, Tim Petranchuk, Peter Pham, Zavon Sanders and Rob Sperrazza. \ufffdI can\ufffdt tell you how proud I am of these guys.

Senior Nick Madden's 17 kills lead the way while junior Caleb Zimmick notched 13. Freshman Casey White chipped in 11 and junior DJ White rounded out the foursome with 10. Zimmick finished the night hitting a career-high .571 (11-4-25) as Madden posted a .351 percentage. Nick Bendell handled setting responsibilities as the freshman handed out a career-best 47 assists. DJ White was one dig shy of his first double-double of the season recording nine to go with his kill total while C. White, Madden and senior Chris Gibbons added seven each. Senior Kyle Rehkemper and Zimmick let the charge at the net with three blocks each. Princeton (0-5, 0-0 EIVA) was led offensively by senior Pat Schwagler who totaled a match-best 22 kills and .514 hitting clip. Harvard came out strong in the first set, earning a 25-20 victory behind six kills from Madden. On a Zimmick kill the Crimson jumped out to 14-11 lead and continued to stay out in front to eventually go up, 20-16. Princeton chipped away at the lead and came within two, 21-19, but Harvard used a 4-1 run to finish the set. The Crimson jumped out to 4-1 lead in the second and was on top, 11-8, as the midway point approached. Leading 19-18, Harvard embarked on a 6-3 run down the stretch to put the frame away on a kill from DJ White, 25-21. Princeton bounced-back and forced Harvard to play from behind in the third to force a fourth set. The Crimson trailed by as many as five, 17-12 before a 4-2 stretch, which featured two kills by C. White, pulled Harvard within three, 19-16. The Tigers finished the frame on a 6-4 run to steal the set, 25-20. Princeton bounced-back and led nearly the entire way to force a fourth set.

And though Lockport will graduate 11 seniors from this year\ufffds team, program founder Joe Whalen, who returned to coach the Lions two years ago, believes there are even better days ahead for Lockport volleyball., 256274=Lockport volleyball squad revels in undefeated season By Jonah Bronstein | Niagara Correspondent Saturday November 23, 2013, 611169=Blue Devils\ufffd boys volleyball could surprise with help of newcomers Wednesday September 18, 2013 | By:Dave Ricci, Sports Reporter | Sports, 338627=Clarence\ufffds boys volleyball team was able to effectively neutralize the hitting prowess of the tallest squad in Western New York, but was unable to match Lockport when it made an adjustment to its strategy during Saturday\ufffds 25-22, 29-27, 25-11 win in the Section VI Class A semifinal that ended the Red Devils\ufffd playoff run. Coach Kevin Starr pointed to the second game of the match as the turning point, conceding that the Red Devils \ufffdcouldn\ufffdt make the defensive plays we needed to at the right times\ufffd to put the Lions away when Clarence had match point. In the end, Brandon Hill and Dale Payne ended their Clarence careers with seven and six kills, respectively, while junior Tommy Ecker added six. Seniors Derek Burghardt and Ted Okon had four kills each in their final high school match. \ufffdLockport is the tallest team in Western New York, and we actually did a pretty good job of limiting the damage they did offensively by changing our blocking scheme,\ufffd Starr said. \ufffdThe main problem was that once we did that, they started to tip the ball rather than pound it, and our defense was caught on its heels too many times.\ufffd Clarence reached the semifinals by knocking off rival Orchard Park in the quarterfinal round, 21-25, 25-17, 25-15, 25-17. The Red Devils started the match off by missing six serves, which Starr noted \ufffdhas been a real problem for us,\ufffd but they got back on track en route to dominating the rest of the match. Hill had 13 kills and 14 digs, while Payne added 11 kills. Senior setter Skyler Reinhardt had 35 assists, while Ecker added five kills in the third game. \ufffdWe had beaten Orchard Park twice in league play and also in a couple of tournaments, but they had improved quite a bit since we\ufffdd last seen them,\ufffd Starr said. \ufffdThey brought up a couple of sophomores to the varsity early in the season, and as those kids got some varsity experience the team had started to win some big matches, including a sweep against Frontier \ufffd which had beaten us twice this year. Fortunately, our senior outside hitters came up big for us.\ufffd Clarence will officially close out its season on Sunday, Nov. 17, with its annual awards banquet., 602510=OP should make noise in tough league Fall Sports Preview: Boys Volleyball Thursday September 19, 2013, 483159=Team Finals Hamburg 31-23-15, Canisius 29-25-13 Semifinals Hamburg 25-25, Frontier 20-23 Canisius 25-25, St. Joe's 20-12 POOL A St. Francis 25-25, Maryvale 20-17 Hamburg 25-25, Canisius 17-21 St. Francis 23-16, Hamburg 25-25 Maryvale 20-8, Canisius 25-25 St Francis 14-13, Canisius 25-25 Maryvale 10-8, Hamburg 25-25 POOL B St Joe's 25-25, Cheektowaga 13-7 Lancaster 25-25, Frontier 9-13 Frontier 26-18, St. Joe's 24-25 Lancaster 25-25, Cheektowaga 14-20 St Joe's 25-25, Lancaster 12-20 Frontier 25-25, Cheektowaga 13-10\u00a0 Individual MVP: Ryan Dils (Ham) All tournament: Jay Baumann (Lancaster), Neil Conway (SJ), Brian Costello (Can), Trevor Gooch (Can), Doug Horbachewski (Ham), Patrick Stroh (Ham)., 356828=With lower numbers this season and the hope of returning to the sectional big stage, Eden head coach Robert Pierce said that he has been a little harder on his players, in an attempt to get the best out of them. That worked, during a 14th consecutive division championship season in which Eden finished unbeaten, and during a showing at the Orchard Park Tournament, toward the end of the regular season. But whether it will be a factor in the postseason among a highly-competitive Class B field remains to be seen. After two seasons of not making it to the sectional final, Pierce said he hopes the 27-time sectional champions can find the motivation and consistently sound play to make yet another run at a title. \ufffdI\ufffdm always pretty hard on my kids; coming from a small school, they battle that external and internal motivation,\ufffd Pierce said. \ufffdWe\ufffdve also got low numbers this year, so the kids don\ufffdt have much behind them, to help them compete. I\ufffdve been more aggressive with them and the kids have responded. The level of execution has been high, but we still have our work cut out for us.\ufffd Pierce has relied on outside Declan Pierce and middle Hayden Herc, throughout the season, for impactful play. Declan, his son, has become an offensive weapon with an ability to score from anywhere on the court, while Herc has been a difference-maker in the middle, according to the coach. Pierce said that he has been pleasantly surprised by setter Jake Schlegel\ufffds lifting his game and confidence. He said that he will depend on Schlegel, also a baseball player, to quarterback this group. Outside Cole Overhoff has also turned into a formidable player with his quickness and dangerous serve. He will touch the ball often as the team\ufffds defensive specialist, according to his coach. On Eden\ufffds road to contending for a title, the second-seeded Raiders will likely met Starpoint on Oct. 29 in a Class B quarterfinal and, with a win, would have moved on to an Oct. 30 meeting with either defending sectional champion Lake Shore, a 10th-seed, or No. 7 North Tonawanda, one of Niagara Frontier League\ufffds top teams. A potential semifinal match could see Eden and third-seeded Williamsville South team meet on Saturday, Nov. 1. All of the semifinals in Class A and B are to be held that day, 3 p.m., at the higher seeds. \ufffdSouth plays with a lot of moxie and emotion,\ufffd Pierce noted. \ufffdWe\ufffdve beaten them before, but my guys played real well and were really up for it to do so.\ufffd A trip to the final, which has eluded the Raiders the past two seasons, could bring about a meeting with Hamburg. The Bulldogs are the favorite in the draw, after sharing the Erie County Interscholastic Conference Division I crown at 11 \ufffd 1 with West Seneca West. Hamburg mostly played with teams a classification above it. With size and experience to choose from, the Bulldogs also won three tournaments, including the regular season\ufffds final two at Orchard Park and in their own gym at Hamburg. The Bulldogs were last in the finals in 2011, when they lost a five-game match to Lake Shore. \ufffdHamburg has proved, this season, they\ufffdre at a top level. They\ufffdve got some high level kids and [head coach] Brian [Carroll] has been there before,\ufffd Pierce said. \ufffdThey beat us, but we\ufffdve played them competitively, this year. Whether we could shock the world, would depend on how ready we were to go and how much we want it.\ufffd Pierce said that Hamburg has also been good in tight matches, pulling through in many four- and five-set battles with other good teams. He said that his team has played in a few of those, but probably not enough of them. Eden would have to serve well and get Hamburg out of system to have a chance, he added. In Class A, fifth-seeded Frontier began a journey to return to the sectional final with a quarterfinal on Oct. 29 at No. 4 Lancaster. The Falcons lost to Orchard Park in last year\ufffds title after winning it in 2010-11., 734717=Success is defined in the Webster's dictionary as \"a favorable or satisfactory outcome or result.\"\u00a0 What is being a successful volleyball coach?\u00a0 I have been coaching club volleyball for eight years, first as an assistant coach for two years and as a head coach for six. I wasn't assistant for two head coaches that had completely different styles. I tried to take positives from both of those coaches to create my own style of coaching. I had no other resource to draw from because prior to the beginning of my coaching career I had played adult league for 15 years but never in a program. I learned the game from other players and referees. I never had a volleyball coach as a role model. What kind of coach did I want to be in how would I be successful? One measure of success as a coach or program is wins and losses. Having a winning season or going undefeated is a self-evident measure of success. But is being a successful volleyball coach measured by only wins and losses or championships? For some athletic programs and coaches I would say yes. Early in my coaching career the numbers seem to be the most evident sign of success, and I evaluated myself and my success based on the numbers. As I grew as a coach and educated myself through USA volleyball IMPACT and CAP courses, I reevaluated my coaching philosophy and priorities, and the numbers became less important. My coaching style in philosophy changed. Now my mission statement is to promote and nurture a love, understanding and respect for the game of volleyball. It's kind of a simple statement and is now my barometer of success as a coach. Another of my measures of success is developing a player, or a team, to his or her fullest potential. Being from a small club, I am frequently taken on players with limited volleyball skills inexperience to meet our roster number. This poses some obstacles, but also great opportunity. Starting with a mediocre player who has a good attitude and willingness to learn allows you to start with the basics and work toward developing skills and confidence. Watching that players transformation during the season to where he or she becomes competitive in the team begins to win matches bring meaning to the work of a coach achieving success requires a great deal of patience and is progressive over the season or career. While this type of success is gratifying and part of the job description as a coach, it doesn't meet the measure of success for making a difference in players lives. Returning to my mission statement, the final measure of success for coachwork program is to instill a lifelong love of the game in your players. How do you measure that? Early on I had thought it would take years or lifetime to know that one or more of my players would love the game for life and I had something to do with it. I figured it was a good goal, but hard to measure, especially in the short-term. Three years ago after a very mediocre and trying 18s season, I was contemplating whether to continue my coaching career or switch to refereeing. I was analyzing whether I was being successful as a coach. Was I the reason for the recent mediocre season? Was I making a difference? Around this time a player from the most recent team I coached contacted me. She was a player with limited experience and skill, but she had a great attitude. She eventually worked into my second middle and developed a good block. Most players show up early for practice and want extra sets to hit. Well, this player was the one across the net blocking. She took great pride in her blocking. You have to love the defensive mindset. This former player just graduated from high school and had gone off to her freshman year at college. In September, I received an e-mail from her thanking me for my time and my patience with her. She thanked me for teaching her how to block. She also indicated that she was very disappointed that her college did not have a club volleyball team, so she had started her own club at school. Wow! Our team was far from undefeated or of championship caliber. We did not develop NCAA Division I players. But one of my players now had the love and passion to take it upon herself to start her own club team. I had not expected to see evidence of that passion to blossom for years to come. As a coach I have had winning seasons, losing seasons, cream of the crop players and mediocre players that progressed and reached their potential. Not until I receive that e-mail that I feel successful as a coach. I realize that I crossed paths with a young lady who when I met her was moderately enthusiastic about the sport, and now she had a passion for the game of volleyball. I can't help to think I had some small part in that. Her e-mail couldn't have come at a better time, as I pondered my future in coaching. It helped me realize that I was making a difference and help me recommit myself to being the best coach possible. It also made me realize how those players who I have coached in the past have touched my life in such a positive way. And taking my players example, I am looking forward to the start of my first season as club director! \u00a0, 470166=Light week sees Clarence boys volleyball team finish on wrong side of 3-2 decision Clarence Bee Wednesday, October 23, 2013, 509950=The U.S. women\ufffds beach volleyball team of Kerri Walsh Jennings and April Ross took gold while the men\ufffds team of Phil Dalhausser and Casey Jennings settled for silver on Sunday at the FIVB Sao Paulo Grand Slam., 446647=School year\ufffds first Athletes of Month named at West West Seneca Bee Thursday October 24, 2013, 112231=Men's Volleyball Rutgers-Newark vs.Cairn\u00a0 raidervision Thursday January 30, 2014, 282178=The Lions run was ended in the regional final with a loss to Fairport on Nov. 9.

They are fearless. They are hitting the ball on a net a foot higher than it should be.\ufffd And after this year\ufffds championship run, young players in Lockport no longer fear the traditional volleyball powers in the Southern Tier. Lockport\ufffds three-game sweep of Frontier in the Section VI Class A championship wasn\ufffdt just a victory for its own program, but for volleyball in the northern portion of the section. It marked the first sectional championship for an NFL team since Kenmore West in 2000, and the first time a Niagara County school had won the Class A title.\u00a0 The program has come a long way since the 1990s, when Whalen recalls taking the Lions to Lancaster and realizing they didn\ufffdt even belong on the same court with the eventual state champions. This year\ufffds squad, having played against the area\ufffds top players in club tournaments, was never intimidated by the Southtowns opponents senior captain Jack Whalen called \ufffdthe best of the best.\ufffd \ufffdIf anything, the feeling was opposite,\ufffd he said. \ufffdTeams would come in and look at us and be like, wow.\ufffd The Lions made their presence known at the season-opening Clarence Tournament with wins over Lancaster, Orchard Park and West Seneca West. Even as Lockport swept through its NFL slate and entered sectionals having lost just eight games total in 21 matches, Joe Whalen played up the perceived superiority of the Southtowns in the Lions\ufffd locker room. \ufffdLet\ufffds go out and show people that there is good volleyball north of Sweet Home,\ufffd was the coach\ufffds battle cry. \ufffdAfter we beat Grand Island, their coach said to us, \ufffdGo represent the NFL and show the Southtowns what the NFL is about,\ufffd senior captain Bryce Perry said. Joe Whalen already believed he had a team capable of winning the section when Niver asked him to take over the program in 2012.\u00a0 The year before, after Jack Whalen, Bryce Perry and Eamon Yates played on the varsity team as freshmen, Joe Whalen told his son, \ufffdGet your friends and tell them to go along for this ride.\ufffd Around the same time, volleyball official Tom Schneider, a Rochester transplant, started the Lockport Volleyball Club with an under-12 team. Established club programs in Eden and Orchard Park are a big reason the schools in the Southern Tier have been so dominant in sectional play, Joe Whalen said. In the early days, Lockport players had to drive 40 minutes each way to participate in club volleyball. In recent years, they would play for the Panthers Club at Sweet Home Middle School. This winter, Whalen will coach an 18-under team for the Lockport Volleyball Club, which has also added a 14-under team. \ufffdIt helps a lot playing club because there isn\ufffdt much time off,\ufffd Jack Whalen said. \ufffdWe get to the high school season, and we\ufffdre still ready, and we have more experience from club.\ufffd Club play also familiarizes players with the talent in other towns and practice drills high school coaches will use during the season, Joe Whalen said. Lockport will be favored to repeat in the NFL next year, with 6-foot-8 Jason Donorovich, a Division I prospect, and 6-3 Brad Schneider swinging on the outside.\u00a0 The rising talent has Joe Whalen confident the Lions will remain sectional title contenders and perhaps make a state playoff run in the coming years. \ufffdWhoever takes over for me when I leave is going to inherit a very experienced group of young men,\ufffd Joe Whalen said. But this year\ufffds team set a championship standard for its successors.\u00a0 \ufffdWe had a complete, solid squad,\ufffd Joe Whalen said. \ufffdIf you\ufffdve got six kids on the floor who are B-plus players, it\ufffds better than having two great players. We never had to worry about chasing someone else on the floor who wasn\ufffdt playing well.\ufffd As the Lions came together and made their championship run, they became \ufffdthe darlings of Lockport,\ufffd Joe Whalen said, in a city that is normally preoccupied with football and soccer in the fall. \ufffdFor Lockport,\ufffd Jack Whalen said after the sectional victory, \ufffdit was nothing we\ufffdve ever done, and it was everything we\ufffdve ever wanted.\ufffd, 298960=Lockport will take on Fairport today in state FWR By John D'Onofrio Lockport Union-Sun & Journal Saturday November 9, 2013, 529796=Clarence\ufffds David Cummiskey, at left in background, and Ted Okon, at right in background, return to their feet after a successful block during the Red Devils\ufffd 22-25, 25-23, 25-18, 25-14 win Oct. 1.

Cal Baptist \ufffd The Lancers are postseason eligible following their successful transition from NAIA to NCAA Division II. The big challenge this season now is for Cal Baptist to get into the postseason. UC Santa Barbara \ufffd Setter Jonah Seif could be primed for a big breakout season. If the Gauchos can fill the void at middle attacker left by graduated All-American Dylan Davis, UC Santa Barbara should be a playoff team.

South senior Anthony Podgorsak, a four-year starter, recorded 20 kills in his final high school match. Junior middle hitter Christian Graziano added 10 kills. Sophomore setter Joe Zanelotti recorded 45 assists. South finished 24-3 and went 12-0 in ECIC II. Besides Hamburg, the only other team South lost to was Lockport, the Section VI Class A champion. The Billies finished ranked fourth in Western New York large schools. Six seniors and four starters graduate, including Podgorsak, Steve Zaprowski (outside hitter), Kenny Stuber (libero) and Austin Baker (middle hitter). Podgorsak recorded 345 kills, an increase of 54 kills from last year, and 67 aces. The other two seniors on the team are Will Atkinson at middle hitter and Austin Collins at libero. The Billies return Graziano (230 kills, 40 aces, 173 blocks, an increase of 100 blocks from last year), Zanelotti (team-high 70 aces) and junior Ryan Nigro (100 kills, 103 blocks)., 47687=AVCA Division III Men's Coaches Top 15 Week #5 Poll: February 25, 2014 Tuesday, February 25, 2014, 315314=Hamburg crowd helps team to Wednesday's boys volleyball final By: Johnathan Snyder, Reporter | Sports Thursday November 7, 2013, 169988=CONFERENCE CAROLINAS Mount Olive \ufffd Mount Olive has recovered from its postseason disappointment of losing in the conference tournament semifinals. last season The Trojans now are eyeing to become the first team in represent the Conference Carolinas in the NCAA Tournament. Pfeiffer \ufffd The two-time defending Conference Carolinas champions lost its head coach and the conference player of the year from last season. Pfeiffer, though, still has enough returning pieces to be competitive for a third straight title.\u00a0 Lees-McRae \ufffd David Schmidlin begins his first full season as the Bobcats\ufffd head coach. Time to now see if this team can continue the tradition of pulling off some big non-conference upsets. Limestone \ufffd The Saints surprised most people last season reaching the conference championship match after finishing the regular season in fourth place. With all-conference middle attacker Andrew Miller and all-conference outside attacker Eric Zaun returning for another season, Limestone could look even better this season. Erskine \ufffd Erskine has a brutal non-conference schedule with four road matches against nationally ranked teams. That will make this young team well prepared for the heart of its conference season. Belmont Abbey \ufffd The Crusaders will be in contention for a second consecutive postseason appearance. However, for most of nation Belmont Abbey will remain the second most popular abbey in 2014. King \ufffd The Tornado last season lost nine of its final 11 regular season matches and just missed getting the final postseason berth. King earning a postseason berth in 2014 would be a major step forward for this program. Barton \ufffd It took the Bulldogs almost two seasons to win their first match in program history. With that losing streak now behind them, expect Barton to one of the most improved teams this upcoming season. INDEPENDENT TEAMS Coker \ufffd The Cobras begin their first season as an independent team after school left the Conference Carolinas. Perhaps the bigger story for this team is will Coker find another conference to join for future seasons. McKendree \ufffd It\ufffds the inaugural season for the Bearcats men\ufffds volleyball team.

No surprise, his Eden team and Hamburg, both WNY powers, are among those projected challengers. The Raiders may not have any seniors on what amounts to a small team number-wise, but they may have some of the best talent in WNY. Hayden Herc, a 6-foot-4 junior, has learned how to play to his size and improved his footwork, so Pierce said the Raiders will get the ball his way very often. Joining him up front is fellow 6-4 middle Shane Smith, who\ufffds improved his confidence and focus, according to Pierce. Also growing into one of the better players in WNY is sophomore outside Declan Pierce, who can score from almost anywhere on the court and has become a superior passer and improved his court sense, his father and coach noted. Joining Pierce on the outside is Cole Overhoff, who is quick and excels on defense and at serving, according to his coach. Jake Schlagel has been growing as the team\ufffds setter, despite not playing year-round, like many of the others. Also playing on the right side is sophomore Connor Jasinski. Classmate Mitchell Mason, who comes from the football team, is getting more comfortable in his role, while Mike Seggio has shown good court awareness, Pierce said. Eden was one of only a few WNY teams to make it to the championship bracket of the Eden Pan Am Invitational, last week. But Hamburg beat Eden in a non-league match, winning in three close games. Among Hamburg\ufffds returning players are senior leftside Patrick Stroh, an all-division first team selection last year with a big jump; junior 6-foot-4 middle hitter Zach Yerrington; physical senior rightside Trevor Vail and junior leftsideDoug Horbachewski, whose well-roundedness has allowed him to contribute at several positions. Also for Hamburg, sophomore Ryan Dils steps into the starting setter spot; junior Brian Camp has been a surprise at middle blocker and senior Ryan Filas will be a first-year starter at libero. Back row specialists include Chris Fuentes, Matt Touris, Charlie Gordner, Kody Omphalius and John-Francis Orozcom, while Tom Hoff has helped with his blocking. \ufffdWe have a high ceiling for improvement and we have a real nice team that is very unselfish,\ufffd said Hamburg head coach Brian Carroll, whose team took second at the Clarence Tournament. Last season\ufffds Class B champion Lake Shore is in a transition year, after graduating one of the volleyball program\ufffds highest-ranked senior classes to ever step foot on the court. The Eagles won two straight sectional titles and, last year, advanced to the state title game after a Far West Regional victory. Only senior libero Brad Owens remains from the starting six, while freshman Devin Joslyn and sophomore Kyle Wishman will be looked to in sharing setting duties, as well as passing and hitting. Sophomore Nathan Myers and junior Tyler Becker will play in the middle and juniors Gabriel Carruth and Michael Roach will bring athleticism and versatility to the outside, according to head coach John Coyle. Rounding out the roster are Steven Budniewski, Andrew Busch, Joe Nappo, Steven Duruski, Stone Garlow and Christian Gravius. Frontier returns much of a team that battled Orchard Park to a five-game Class A championship match and looks to bring back the sectional crown the program won in 2010 and `11. Captains Dylan Durni and Jake Gleason, both Second Team All-Western New York selections, will play major roles in Frontier\ufffds chance at a title. Durni, a senior coming off a season in which he led the team in kills, has already been named all-tournament at Eden. Gleason, a four-year varsity junior, led the team in aces and assists. Also expected to be key players in head coach Bill Faust\ufffds rotation are seniors Erik Hatten, who moves from middle hitter to opposite, after finishing second on the team in kills; Jeffrey Taylor, an outside hitter who played opposite last year, and Peter Lotecki, who led the squad in digs as its libero. Also, senior Tom Stoklosa, a standout in swimming and baseball, has joined the team this season and already become a factor at middle hitter. Newcomers include Tyler Tomasik, Matthew Buss, Andrew Heppner and Josh Zdon. St. Francis has one of the most experienced teams in Andy Lanigan\ufffds seven seasons, since taking over the program he once played for, but fellow Monsignor Martin teams St. Joe\ufffds and Canisius are two of the top three ranked teams in WNY. Lanigan said he is hoping his team can rise to the challenge in the league, using a difficult schedule, heavily stacked with road games to start the season, to ready for the postseason. Among six seniors on the team are three-year starting middle hitter Tom Duszkiewicz, a Second Team All-Catholic selection last year, and Jack Moretti, one of the taller setters in WNY who is also another weapon on offense. At outside hitter are two three-year starters in the taller Dave Kennedy and shorter Nick Novak, who Lanigan joked are like Mutt and Jeff, but both can sky into the air. Also returning to a starting spot is sophomore libero Jack Kaempf, who is back after breaking his arm, last season. Key dates on St. Francis\ufffd schedule include Sept. 26 for the Rock the Red Homecoming Game against St. Joe\ufffds and then Oct. 2 for the annual Blackout Game against 13-time defending league champion Canisius. St. Francis, which took second at the Cheektowaga Tournament, will also play in the Hamburg Invitational on Oct. 19., 98721=AVCA Division I-II Men's Week #6 Poll: February 10, 2014 Monday, February 11, 2014, 168581=Harvard \ufffd The culture of the program his completely changed. The players now not only know they can win, but know they can compete a EIVA championship. George Mason \ufffd Returning to the court can be the best escape for the Patriot players as they continue mourning the loss of their former teammate Pat Sibley, who died in August. St. Francis \ufffd It\ufffds been two years of missing the postseason for St. Francis. All-EIVA outside attacker Logan Patterson and a veteran team returning gives the Red Flashes good reason to believe that postseason drought ends this year. NJIT \ufffd Coach Ryan McNeil, besides being one of the most rebellious voters in the national coaches poll, has spent several years focusing on recruiting internationally. The Highlanders have players from Barbados to Poland on its roster and could be an intriguing to watch this season. Sacred Heart \ufffd For as bad as Sacred Heart\ufffds 4-19 record looked last season, the Pioneers were competitive in most of their matches. Expect Sacred Heart to continue to improve in 2014 but a postseason appearance is still a few years away. Rutgers-Newark \ufffd Only one more year before this team officially moves to NCAA Division III, leaves the EIVA and becomes competitive for a league title., 356611=Eden looks to reach boys volleyball final By: Michael J.

It was in pool play, during the first of what would become two tournament titles in as many weekends, in a match against Clarence. Carroll\ufffds team trailed 23 \ufffd 18 and suddenly, Carroll said the light bulb went on and has stayed on since. Hamburg went on to win that game 27 \ufffd 25 and clawed its way through to a title at the Orchard Park Tournament on Oct. 12, a night after defeating that same Clarence team in an Erie County Interscholastic Conference I divisional match., 294896=CLIFTON SPRINGS, N.Y. \ufffd A first-ever undefeated Niagara Frontier League championship season and the school\ufffds first-ever Section VI volleyball championship are consolations that Lockport High School can live with. On Saturday, Lockport\ufffds historic boys volleyball season came to an end with a straight-set loss to Fairport in the 2013 New York State large school Far West Regional at Midlakes High School. The scores were 25-12, 25-20, 27-25. Head coach Joe Whalen\ufffds Lions finished 12-0 in the NFL and were 25-4 overall, earning their first Section VI Class A title last Wednesday at Hamburg High School with a straight-set win over Frontier. It\ufffds the farthest a Lockport volleyball team has ever gone in the postseason. Section V\ufffds Fairport earned a FWR berth with a win over three-pete-champion McQuaid last Thursday. Head coach John O\ufffdDell\ufffds Red Raiders now advance to compete in the state tourney finals at the Glens Falls Civic Center on Friday.\u00a0 The Lions can look back fondly on their many historic accomplishments. \ufffdI was proud of them before we started, and today, they showed once again that they belonged on that court with the best in New York state,\ufffd Whalen said. \ufffdLike I said on Friday, today was gravy on the year. I think everything they envisioned as goals they reached. They rose to the level that they were challenged to get to. They would have loved to win, but they felt they lost to a quality squad. There was still smiles on their faces when we got done. They had a great run and it was an unforgettable experience.\ufffd Middle hitter Jason Donorovich led Lockport with 7 kills and 3 blocks. Fellow junior Brad Schneider added 6 kills for the Lions spikers. Seniors Bryce Perry and Shawn Moore added three and two kills, respectively. \ufffdTheir jump serving didn\ufffdt turn out to be as much of an issue as I thought it would be,\ufffd Whalen said. \ufffdIn the first game, our front row just didn\ufffdt get good positioning. In the second game, I thought we matched up pretty well and we started to impact their game. That game was a lot closer than the score indicates.\u00a0 \ufffdBy the third game we really had the lead, 16-10, and moved ahead by 22-17, then we had a five-point lapse that started with perhaps a bad call \ufffd I\ufffdm not so sure about that \ufffd but we lost some concentration, we missed a few hits and before you know it, they\ufffdre back in the game.\ufffd Donorovich, Schneider and LHS senior libero Eamon Yates were recently named NFL First Team all-stars. Following Saturday\ufffds FWR loss, Yates was honored by the NYSPHSAA by being named to the All-State Playoff Team.\u00a0 \ufffdIt was a deserving honor for Eamon.

As the Bulldogs gear up for the 2013 season they will lean on the Tom and Tom combo to lead the squad. Drake Dejesus, Kyle Patterson and Michael Crawford, who were the core of the program\ufffds resurgence in recent years, have all graduated after taking the \ufffdDogs to the Class B title game last season. This season, co-captains Tom Barton and Tom Vancuran will lead a very young Bulldogs team that features just one other returning player \ufffd Justin Haeick, an outside hitter/middle blocker. Barton will anchor the back row as his team\ufffds starting libero, while Vancuran will set and play outside hitter. Though the three returnees saw somewhat limited time last season, Bulldogs coach Kyle Horvatis said Barton and Vancuran have both taken a great deal of pride in being leaders and have shown early on they are ready to do whatever is asked of them. Horvatis added that while both have been working hard and setting the right examples for their teammates, Vancuran has really emerged as a standout all-around player. \ufffdHe\ufffds the only guy right now who possesses that all-around nature for the game,\ufffd said Horvatis. \ufffdHe\ufffds the closest that would come to Kyle Patterson or Mike Crawford, and he showed that last year, too, as a 10th grader.\ufffd Horvatis stated that he thinks the rest of the team will learn and improve just by watching Vancuran and Barton. Vancuran and Barton know that with a young team a lot is riding on their shoulders and they don\ufffdt want to let their teammates down. \ufffdWe want to show leadership and obviously help lead our team to success,\ufffd Vancuran said. Though the Bulldogs are young, the plus side is that with so many guys having graduated it opens the door of opportunity to win starting jobs. \ufffdI think that a lot of these guys they\ufffdve stepped up and they understand the leadership role they have to take on the court,\ufffd Vancuran said. \ufffdAnd us veterans who are coming back we\ufffdve helped them out and show them stuff.\ufffd Horvatis said that, early on, Rob Mol at setter, Rhett Boswell (middle), Michael Rice (right) and Ben Leising (outside hitter/middle blocker) have made impressive strides and taken advantage of their playing time. \ufffdThey played very well (in our opener against Sweet Home) and they know the deal about what they have to do as well to be part of this year\ufffds success,\ufffd Horvatis said. The Bulldogs lineup also features Josh Emer and Nick Henry, both outside hitters, and Jeff Wolfe at libero., 490375=When Thom Knab was informed he was selected for induction into the 2013 Western New York Boys Volleyball Hall of Fame, a range of emotions flooded his mind. \ufffdI was very surprised and honored to receive it and humbled knowing the coaches who have been inducted ahead of me like Joe Gillespie (Eden), Charlie O\ufffdBrien (Cleveland Hill) and Joe Foley (Lackawanna),\ufffd said Knab, Williamsville South\ufffds boys volleyball coach. Knab, an Iroquois graduate, will be inducted at a banquet on Thursday, Nov. 7, at Illio DiPaolo\ufffds Restaurant in Blasdell.

Her semester break started a little later than most college students. When she arrived in Eden for the first time in seven months it was with an experience unrivaled by her peers. The Penn State sophomore made it back for a second straight season to the NCAA women\ufffds volleyball Final Four and this time, her Nittany Lions left as champions \ufffd the national power\ufffds sixth overall. Pierce, a role player as a defensive and serving specialist, played in three of Penn State\ufffds four games as the second seed in the tournament defeated upstart Wisconsin on Dec. 21 in Seattle, Wash. The championship match and other tournament action were televised on ESPN2. \ufffdWhen I got home, I was just excited to see everyone, in general, because it was the first time in seven months that I was home, Pierce said. \ufffdI got one hug from everyone for being missed and another hug for winning a title. It\ufffds amazing all of the support I received and all of the people who tuned in to watch.\ufffd The Eden High School 2012 graduate has reached rare territory as a college athlete, by being part of a Division I national championship team. She had plenty of stories to tell from her experiences over the past seven months. \ufffdIt didn\ufffdt sink in right away that we did it,\ufffd Pierce said. \ufffdIt\ufffds hard to wrap your head around it at first. It\ufffds a dream to win a national championship, and it\ufffds an accomplishment that\ufffds easier said than done, but we did it.\ufffd Pierce said emotions were flying about from players, as they celebrated, in many ways because of the way the season ended last year, with a disappointing loss in the national semifinals. A senior-led Penn State had last won a title in 2010 and was finding it difficult recapturing that same spark. Players were determined to find a way as they went through a demanding offseason regimen, which Pierce said she feels separates this program from others. \ufffdWe had that awful feeling after last year\ufffds Final Four,\ufffd Pierce remembered. \ufffdWe started training for this season right after we lost. We train for it all year. I\ufffdm blessed to go to a school where training for a championship is what you do.\ufffd There would be no disappointment this time around in the Final Four. Pierce said the team may have played the cleanest match of the season in a three-game sweep of No. 3 Washington. In the other national semifinal, top-seeded Texas was knocked off by Wisconsin. A fellow Big-10 team, Penn State had beaten Wisconsin in a pair of regular season sweeps. Pierce said that helped the team\ufffds confidence going into the final.She noted the team\ufffds biggest scare came in the Round of 8 against another perennial power in Stanford. Penn State won a five-game match that went the distance.\u00a0 Pierce doesn\ufffdt play the same sort of role for Penn State that she once did at Eden High School and for Niagara Frontier Club Volleyball. As a senior, she won a third straight state title and was named state tournament Most Valuable Player. She\ufffds now simply looking to help provide her team with a spark, on the court, with a key serve or dig, and while on the bench, by cheering on and encouraging her teammates. \ufffdYou go from being a big fish in a small pond to being just another fish here,\ufffd she said. \ufffdFor now, I\ufffdve found my niche by giving the team energy on and off the bench.\ufffd Just to be in that role is a big accomplishment as Pierce came to Penn State as a walk-on, earning her spot on the team and eventually a scholarship. But Pierce said she\ufffds got plenty more to give. \ufffdI had to fight just to get on the court,\ufffd she said. \ufffdI\ufffdm constantly putting in hours, even on top of the time we put in for our workouts.\ufffd And what she\ufffds already learned over the first few seasons from so many veteran players will be invaluable over her final two seasons. She should get more of an opportunity to play with what will amount to a newer looking team next season. \ufffdAs we flew to the Final Four, I sat with a couple of the seniors on the plane to Seattle,\ufffd she said. \ufffdThey all won a championship as freshmen. They talked about how as the past few seasons built up, the pressure got to them. They stressed the importance of just going after it. I\ufffdll always take what they said with me.\ufffd She won\ufffdt have long before next season is her main focus. The time at home and away from the court will only be short-lived.\u00a0 Pierce said the team will get off the rest of the semester and then the first week back to school \ufffd for winning the title, before getting right back at work. Kendall is also excited to help welcome younger sister, Lainy, to the campus and volleyball team next season, as well. Pierce can\ufffdt wait to start back up. She didn\ufffdt work this long and this hard and get to this point, just to sit around for too long at home.\u00a0, 297770=Lockport, Hamburg Lose In Far West Regionals Buffalo News Sunday November 10, 2013, 513107=Team Pool A St. Joe's 25-25, Eden 18-22 Orchard Park 25-25, Maryvale 13-23 St. Joe's 25-25, Orchard Park 19-19 Eden 25-25, Maryvale 11-13 St. Joe's 25-25, Maryvale 13-10 Eden 25-25, Orchard Park 18-18 Pool B Hamburg 25-25, St. Francis 18-21 Clarence 25-25, Lake Shore 11-13 Hamburg 25-25, Lake Shore 10-19 Clarence 25-25, St. Francis 22-7 Hamburg 28-25, Clarence 26-23 St. Francis 25-25, Lake Shore 8-16 Quarterfinals St. Francis 31, Eden 29 Clarence 30, Orchard Park 20 Semifinals Clarence 31-25, St. Joe's 29-23 Hamburg 25-24-15, St. Francis 11-26-9 Finals Hamburg 25-21-15, Clarence 23-25-6\u00a0, 750502=The 15U team travels to York, PA for the North Eastern National Qualifier on January 26-27., 686882=Nazareth Men's Volleyball vs Medaille\u00a0 AthleticsNaz Wednesday, March 6, 2013, 579711=Western New York 2013 Boy's Top 10 Poll - 9/24/13 Tuesday, September 24, 2013, 537979=West boys volleyball survives five-set marathons, wins twice West Seneca Bee Thursday, October 3, 2013, 506888=Maryvale boys spikers set lofty goals after upsetting end to 2012 By: Marquel Slaughter, Reporter | Sports Monday October 14, 2013, 47157=UC Irvine Men's Volleyball vs USC 2014 Anteater TV Tuesday, February 25, 2014 Anteater Television's Ella Rosenfeld catches up with UCI Men's Volleyball players after a great 5 game win over USC, 109893=Williamsville South graduate Evan Singer, a three-year player for the D\ufffdYouville College men\ufffds volleyball team, recorded a career-high five blocks at the SUNYIT Invitational against Elms College Jan. 24 and then matched it against Wentworth Jan. 25.

The Crusaders have been the class of the Monsignor Martin division, winning 13 straight championships. St. Francis was within a point in game one, 17 \ufffd 16, before Canisius won 8 of the game\ufffds final 11 points. The Red Raiders had a 5-point lead three separate times in the second game, before a controversial call seemed to turn the momentum in the visitor\ufffds favor. With a 5-point advantage, the Red Raiders\ufffd return hit the ceiling and looked to come down on their own side. The Canisius defender then extended up around the net and, in the eyes of the Saint Francis staff, reached over, which many said should have resulted in a violation. \ufffdI think that\ufffds the game-changer right there,\ufffd said Lanigan, whose team was playing in its annual Blackout Game. \ufffdIf we win that game, who knows what happens in game three; then, this place goes nuts.\ufffd St. Francis has been led by a senior class featuring Tom Duzkiewicz. Nicknamed \ufffdThe Hammer,\ufffd Duzkiewicz is a three-year varsity starter and Second-Team All-Catholic selection. Lanigan said that Duskiewicz is respected and well-liked by his teammates. Seniors Jack Moretti and Nick Novak are also two key players. Moretti contributes height and offense, while the smaller Novak brings versatility. Lanigan said he has been impressed with the play of sophomore Jake Kaempf. At the Canisius game, the students were loudly behind their team, rooting hard, every serve. Lanigan and his staff said that they have noticed the outpouring of support, not only at volleyball games, but at all sporting events thus far, this school year. \ufffdThe culture here at Frannies is starting to change,\ufffd said Lanigan. \ufffdWe saw it at homecoming; we saw it at our Rock the Red game and you\ufffdre seeing it at other sporting events. The senior class, I have to give them credit for trying to put us [back] on the map.\ufffd Lanigan said that his team can make some noise, come the playoffs, regardless of where it sits in the standings. St. Francis is in fourth behind Canisius, St. Mary\ufffds and St. Joe\ufffds. Until then, there is still a lot of volleyball to be played and a lot of time for chemistry to develop. \ufffdWe have to learn to win,\ufffd Lanigan said. \ufffdWe play anybody, anywhere, anytime, any place, and it\ufffds only going to make us better. We started the season with five games on the road and I did that for a reason, because I want our guys to be battle tested, to know that they can play with anybody in Western New York and I think we can.\ufffd\u00a0, 620844=Amherst boys volleyball rebounds against Holland By: Amherst Bee Wednesday September 18, 2013, 444229=\u00a0 Since then, the Bulldogs have handed West Seneca West its first loss of the division season, to move into a first-place tie at 10 \ufffd 1, and captured the Hamburg Tournament as the hosts, on Oct. 19.

Returners from last season Zach Yerrington and Trevor Vail were also forces, during the Hamburg Tournament. Carroll said another one of those turning points for his team was in beating West, which had been dominant in division play, throughout the season. Hamburg swept the Indians in three games. During the Hamburg Tournament, after splitting two sets with Canisius in pool play, the Bulldogs took a long game one 31 \ufffd 29 and were on the cusp of a sweep with a 23 \ufffd 20 lead in the next game, but Canisius scored 5 unanswered, to force a third game.

But South junior middle hitter Christian Graziano looked to the referee and rubbed his fingers together above his head, indicating he had touched the ball. The Billies went on to lose the game, 31-29, and the match. South lost the first game, 17-25, and won the second game, 25-14. \ufffdIt was the right call,\ufffd Knab said. \ufffdI was so proud of him. It also made me proud of the culture I had created. He felt comfortable enough in this culture to make the call at game point, know that I would be fine with it, understand that life goes on and just knew it was right. \ufffdThis call was gutsy. He showed the game comes before the player. He put himself in the other team\ufffds shoes. He represented himself, his school, his team, his mother and his coach with honor. I am proud of my entire team but especially proud of this young man. This volleyball player served up honesty when we really don\ufffdt see it often enough in our society.\ufffd South beat Williamsville East, 25-19, 25-18, for third place. \ufffdI give the kids a lot of credit because they were really disappointed after the loss to Lockport,\ufffd Knab said. The Billies went 6-0 in pool play, beating Cicero North Syracuse, 25-16, 25-23; Cheektowaga, 25-10, 25-15; and Williamsville East, 25-20, 25-17. Graziano, an all-tournament team selection, finished the tournament with 22 kills and 12 blocks. Senior outside hitter Anthony Podgorsak recorded 35 kills to also earn all-tournament team accolades. Junior right-side hitter Ryan Nigro added 14 kills, senior outside hitter Steve Zaprowski had 16 kills and sophomore setter Joe Zanelotti had 73 assists. The loss to Lockport was South\ufffds first loss of the season. They won the Maryvale Tournament Aug. 31; beat Amherst, Lockport and Williamsville North in non-league matches; and recorded ECIC II victories over West Seneca East, Iroquois, Sweet Home, Lake Shore and Starpoint. Every match was won in three games except Sweet Home, which South won in four games. Podgorsak has consistently been the team\ufffds leader in kills, including 13 kills and four aces against Lake Shore Sept. 19 and 18 kills against Starpoint Sept. 23. Knab also lauded the play of junior Paul Jager, JV call-up, who stepped in and played well in place of Zaprowski, who was injured for two weeks with a high ankle sprain. Knab attributes a lot of the team\ufffds success to the experience of the returning players who played club volleyball. South traveled to West Seneca East Tuesday, but information about the match was unavailable before press time. They host Iroquois Wednesday and compete in the Lockport Tournament Saturday.

The Section VI boys volleyball finals tend to showcase the strength of the ECIC, but on Wednesday the Lions flexed the muscle of the Niagara Frontier League in beating Frontier in three games. The 25-21, 25-18, 25-21 victory in the Class A match ended Lockport\ufffds long wait for its first section title. The last NFL team to win a sectional title was Kenmore West in 2000. \ufffdIt\ufffds the first time Lockport has been in the sectionals with the Southtowns and we wanted to show that our program has come a long way and that we can play any of these teams,\ufffd said Lockport coach Joe Whalen. \ufffdIt\ufffds been a while since the NFL has been here. This means a lot to us.\ufffd The Lions (24-3) will play the winner of tonight\ufffds Section V final between McQuaid and Webster on Saturday in a 4 p.m. regional at Midlakes. Lockport\ufffds Shawn Moore had six kills and seven blocks while Brad Schneider had 13 kills. \ufffdBrad is usually my go-to guy and he had a great night, but Shawn played the best match so far this year,\ufffd said Whalen. \ufffdHe blocked great, stayed at the net, and just really controlled things defensively.\ufffd Four-year senior setter Jack Whalen, the program\ufffds career assists leader and son of the coach, predicted Lockport would make the final. \ufffdFor Lockport, it was nothing we\ufffdve ever done, and it was everything we\ufffdve ever wanted,\ufffd Jack Whalen said. \ufffdIt was nice to come out here and show a couple of these guys who\ufffds boss. I don\ufffdt think they came as prepared as we did. We were hustling the entire game. We came out the first point like we were ready until the last point we were ready.\ufffd The Falcons (9-13) found another gear the past couple of weeks and played themselves into what was their fourth consecutive trip to the final. \ufffdWe played with so much emotion for the past week that at some point \ufffd we definitely ran out of some steam tonight,\ufffd said Frontier coach Bill Faust. \ufffdWe really had been playing some lockdown defense, tonight I\ufffdve got to hand it to Lockport, they outplayed us in a lot of facets. They earned it.\ufffd Hitting errors and unforced errors robbed Frontier of sustaining any momentum and they also had issues at the net against the Lions\ufffd 6-foot-8 Jason Donorovich and the 6-6 Moore. Frontier was led by Jake Gleason\ufffds 30 assists and 16 kills from Dylan Durni and 13 by Erik Hatten. \ufffdJust to be here meant a lot, but we have high expectations of our program,\ufffd Faust said. \ufffdThe last four years we\ufffdve been in the dance and we took two of them, but these last two, we let it slip a little bit.\ufffd, 547692=Sweet Home boys volleyball experiencing early-season success by PATRICK J.

Seniors Tyler Nosal and Wayne Hunzinger were standout performers in that match, according to coach Andrew Murtha, as each contributed strong passing and defense. Maryvale, which earned some good experience in its recent appearance at the Orchard Park Tournament, is hoping to perform well in this week\ufffds final divisional contests against Cheektowaga (Tuesday) and Depew (Friday). Friday\ufffds contest also serves as the Flyers\ufffd Senior Night contest. \ufffdWe have steadily improved each week this season and hope to continue to get better, especially with blocking and defense, just in time to peak for the sectional playoffs,\ufffd Murtha said.\u00a0, 604022=Hamburg, Eden looking to challenge for Class B title Thursday September 19, 2013 | By:Michael J. Petro | Sports, 287804=The Lake Shore boys volleyball team lost its entire starting roster from a team that won two consecutive Section VI titles, and advanced to the state championship in 2012. Replacing that elite lineup wasn\ufffdt easy, but the 10th-seeded Eagles found themselves with a chance to reach the semifinals of the Class B playoffs, when they matched up with the second-seeded Raiders of Eden on Oct. 31. That is where the season would end for a young Lake Shore squad that made strides, this season. Meanwhile, the Raiders fell to Williamsville South in the semifinals, two days later. Eagles head coach John Coyle, in his 19th season, had a challenging task when the season started, as he worked with players that had little to no experience on a varsity team. \ufffdIt was a lot of a feeling-out process,\ufffd said Coyle. \ufffdIt was a lot of \ufffdwho\ufffds going to work here, who\ufffds going to work there, what\ufffds going to work with this rotation?\ufffd We switched our rotation around a half-dozen more times than I wanted to, early in the year.\ufffd This year\ufffds team returned just one player, libero Brad Owens, the only senior in the starting lineup. It finished the regular season with an overall record of 9 \ufffd 9 and a 7 \ufffd 5 mark in Erie County Interscholastic Conference II play. Lake Shore upset seventh-seeded North Tonawanda in straight sets in the pre-quarterfinals, setting up the matchup with a familiar foe. Coyle said the playoff win will be helpful going forward, with a young and inexperienced team. The Eagles relied on Devin Joslyn, a freshman and younger brother of former Eagles standout and 2013 graduate Ryan Joslyn, as their floor captain this year. Coyle said that Joslyn\ufffds experience playing club volleyball was important, as well as his versatility. He was a setter this year and contributed in hitting and passing, as well. Sophomore Kyle Wishman was another setter for the Eagles who was forced to play all over the floor, throughout the season. Owens added experience he gained from advancing to the state championship a year ago. The Eagles will look to use this year as a building block for future success. \ufffdTo finish over .500 in the division is a big accomplishment for these kids and winning a sectional match is a step forward,\ufffd Coyle said., 649169=The 2013 version of the Williamsville North varsity boys volleyball team looks almost nothing like last year\ufffds squad that finished 12-8. Only two players who regularly saw time in the starting lineup return, senior captains Connor Mergler (6-foot-4 outside hitter) and Will Stryker (setter, three-year varsity player). They are the only seniors on the roster. Juniors Sam Cimato (6-2 outside hitter), Dylan Lambert (6-2 right-side hitter) and Owen Green (6-3 right-side hitter) were on last year\ufffds varsity team but saw limited action. Newer players who will contribute are juniors David Lyskawa (setter), Jeff Calderson (back row/setter), Jackson Collis (libero), Bill Kong (right side), and sophomores Noah Chojnacki (outside hitter), Maceo Jack (6-3 middle hitter), Connor Thomas (back row/set) and Ryan Green (utility). \ufffdIt will be a growing year,\ufffd North coach Mike Minnuto said. \ufffdWe\ufffdll take our lumps a little bit, but we should gain maturity. We have a lot of younger kids who are excited to play. We\ufffdre looking to be competitive in every game.\ufffd, 514230=Lockport boys volleyball coach Joe Whalen knows his Lions needs to stay on top of their game if they want to ride their early-season success to a Niagara Frontier League title. That didn\ufffdt pose an issue on Friday night. The Lions improved to 8-0 in Niagara Frontier League action with a straight-sets home victory over Kenmore West, 25-9, 25-10 and 25-9. Whalen was happy with the Lions\ufffd relentlessness.\u00a0 \ufffdAll you need to do is back off and somebody is going to get you,\ufffd he said. \ufffdKen West has a younger team, and you run the risk of backing off with them. So I was real pleased with that tonight.\ufffd In not \ufffdbacking off,\ufffd the Lions played at a pace they would play at during any tightly-contested match.\u00a0 \ufffdI told our guys that they have to play at the speed that they\ufffdre going to play against when they face top competition,\ufffd Whalen noted. \ufffdThey played with good, crisp speed, had nice combinations and were hitting the ball hard.\ufffd \ufffdYou want to play every game like you\ufffdre facing a team that\ufffds undefeated and in the sectional finals,\ufffd middle Jason Donorovich said. \ufffdYou want to keep playing \ufffd and playing hard.\ufffd The team certainly played hard against the Blue Devils, making quick work of their opponent in all three sets. The Lions had a chance to work on areas of their game that needed fine tuning. Whalen was particularly pleased with the team\ufffds jump-serving, which lent a hand in the Lions\ufffd 10 aces. \ufffdWe had some good jump serves tonight and it was a good game to work on them,\ufffd he said. \ufffdIt\ufffds a risk, because all you need to do is miss it and give the other team the momentum. But we did a pretty good job on serving.\ufffd Donorovich was one of the team\ufffds top players. Based on unofficial stats collected by The Source, the 6-foot-8 junior finished with 18 kills, four aces and four blocks.\u00a0 \ufffdJason Donorovich played a real strong game,\ufffd Whalen said. \ufffdI thought he got up and hit the ball well.\ufffd Senior captain and setter Jack Whalen, Joe Whalen\ufffds son, had 27 assists. Junior outside hitter Brad Schneider added nine kills. Senior outside hitter Bryce Perry chipped in 11 digs; senior captain and libero Eamon Yates had 10. Whalen\ufffds group, now 13-3 overall, tore through its NFL foes the first half of the season. Its only losses came in non-league matches against Section VI powers St. Joe\ufffds, Clarence and Williamsville South. The Lions continued the NFL portion of their schedule when they played Grand Island on Tuesday, Oct. 8 in a big match between the league\ufffds top teams. \ufffdThat game could be the difference of us winning the NFL outright or if we share it,\ufffd Joe Whalen said. \ufffdWe need to be ready for it. They only have one loss and it came against us.\ufffd Preparing for the contest entails focus and hard work in practice, he said. His son bolstered that sentiment. \ufffdI think a lot of (our hard work) comes from the nervousness of someone coming and beating us,\ufffd Jack Whalen said. \ufffdWe don\ufffdt want that to happen, so we won\ufffdt let it. With the skill have, we have a lot more control over our game than other teams do.\ufffd\u00a0, 457889=It\ufffds a rebuilding year for the Iroquois High School boys volleyball team, which was forced to replace nine graduating seniors from last year\ufffds club. The Chiefs feature an eighth-grader in the starting lineup and just one senior on the nine-man roster.\u00a0 It\ufffds been a tough go for the Chiefs as they learn on the fly against some difficult competition, but in early October their hard work was finally rewarded with victory No. 1 on the season. \ufffdIt\ufffds our first win of the season and I hope there are going to be a lot more,\ufffd junior middle hitter Will Taber said after a sweep of Holland on Oct. 10. \ufffdWe\ufffdre getting a lot better.\ufffd The Chiefs dropped their first 10 matches to start the season before getting into the win column. And Iroquois hopes that win over Holland is the start of things to come.\u00a0 \ufffdThat\ufffds certainly a positive for us,\ufffd coach Mark Schlabach said. \ufffdObviously there still are things we can work on, serve receive, passing and some other stuff. But it\ufffds nice to see these guys get a win. They work hard in practice so it was good to see that finally pay off a little bit.\ufffd Iroquois has some big shoes \ufffd literally \ufffd to fill from last year. Among those lost to graduation were 6-foot-6 senior middle hitter David Tharnish and 6-5 senior outside and middle hitter Alex Popovski. Iroquois does have some solid hitters, including Taber and junior outside hitter Matt Hiam, who \ufffdcovers a lot of ground for us,\ufffd Schlabach said. Senior outside hitter Josh Hanley is also having a nice season.\u00a0 The man in the middle of the Chiefs\ufffd attack is the youngest player on the team. Eighth-grade setter Zach Popovski has shown steady improvement and that\ufffds a big reason for the better play for Iroquois.\u00a0 \ufffdHe\ufffds getting there,\ufffd Schlabach said. \ufffdThat\ufffds a lot to ask of an eighth-grader to run a varsity offense, but he\ufffds doing pretty well for us.\ufffd Ben Lang is the lone senior on the roster for the Chiefs, who also count on a pair of freshmen in outside hitters John Weremblewski and Austin Besch. \ufffdWe\ufffdre rebuilding, but we\ufffdre getting better every day in practice,\ufffd Schlabach said.

The fourth-ranked Bulldogs got the best of Frontier, which is seventh in the coaches\ufffd poll, in a four-set win. Hamburg, which improved to 7 \ufffd 1 in ECIC Division I play \ufffd one game behind West Seneca West \ufffd pulled away in the third and fourth sets, after Frontier tied the match in game two.\u00a0 The two-hour match took a toll on both teams and, with the most important games of the season still ahead, conditioning is in the minds of both coaches and players. \ufffdWe did enough to win tonight but, if we want to save our legs for the rest of the season, we have to learn to be more focused,\ufffd said Hamburg head coach Brian Carroll, who is in his 18th season at the helm. \ufffdIt\ufffds not just our team.

Frontier was without Dylan Durni, a Second-Team All Western New York selection, who is nursing an upper-body injury. He has been out the last two weeks and Faust said he expects him to miss another week at least, but is hopeful he will return soon after that, for the playoffs. During that athlete\ufffds absence, different players, who normally do not see as much action, have gotten more playing time. \ufffdI am pleased with how we\ufffdre playing without him and I expect us to be that much better when he returns,\ufffd Faust said. \ufffdWe\ufffdre learning to play very tough without him and I think we relied way too much on him, so we\ufffdre learning to play and win without him.\ufffd Frontier Middle\ufffds Tom Stoklosa and Pat Quinlivan have stepped up in extended roles, as well as Erik Hatten.

More than 3,200 fans were on hand to watch the match. \"I thought tonight's match had the feel of a national semifinal,\" said head coach Mark Pavlik. \"For the most part in the tough parts in the games, Ohio State out-competed us. We had leads late in each game and couldn't finish. The good thing is these are the types of matches we need because these are the types of leads we'll be playing in April and May.\" The Nittany Lions were led by sophomore Aaron Russell (Ellicott City, Md.) who had a match-high 16 kills on .480 hitting and was named the Mike Anderson Penn State Player of the Match.

A sophomore in his first full season of varsity with the North Tonawanda, Willison has helped the Jacks get off to a strong start in 2013, which includes winning the Gary Tocke Tournament on Sept. 21 at Kenmore West. \ufffdI feel like my swing has developed a lot more,\ufffd Willison said in between games of the Tocke Tournament. \ufffdIt started off a little bit rough but it\ufffds gotten progressively better.\ufffd Playing the bulk of last season on the junior varsity, Willison was pulled up to varsity during tournaments and quietly made the most of his time as he worked to get better and better each day. \ufffdThe first time I was on (the court) I was really scared that I wasn\ufffdt going to do all of the motions perfectly, because I was shaking a little bit,\ufffd Willison said. \ufffdBut I was just grateful to be there.\ufffd Willison\ufffds play led to a full-time call-up during sectionals. Willison said the combination of his time on varsity and working with Lumberjacks\ufffd JV coach Andrew Braun went a long way in shaping him into the player he is today. \ufffdHe always told me just give it my all every single game,\ufffd Willison said. \ufffdAfter every single set he always told me just do what you do. Don\ufffdt try to be anybody else.\ufffd Willison is the kind of player a coach couldn\ufffdt ask much more from because the sophomore is consistent. Playing on the left side, he\ufffds been a force through his consistent passing and hitting. In fact, Willison leads the team in average kills per game. \ufffdEvery time he touches the ball the pace slows down so we can set up. He\ufffds always consistent,\ufffd said NT coach Luke Hodgson. \ufffdAnd with that nobody seems to be able to stop him with his hits. I think he\ufffds the total package.\ufffd Hodgson went on to say what also stood out about Willison last season, and continues to this year, has been the way he reads the play. Willison just always seems to be in the right spot at the right time, noted Hodgson. Willison also knows the value of learning by watching others and sees every game and practice as an opportunity to soak up something new about the game that can make him better. \ufffdIt\ufffds all the energy,\ufffd said Willison. \ufffdI love when we have a big crowd. But when my team fires me up and gives me a chest bump; It just gets me fired up.\ufffd The key to Willison\ufffds growth as a player and his solid play this season is simple. He is calm and cool in the way he carries himself. Hodgson said Willison rarely, if ever, gets rattled on the floor and that calmness carries over to his teammates. \ufffdHe\ufffds always having a good time. He\ufffds always friendly, he\ufffds always polite,\ufffd Hodgson said. \ufffdOn the volleyball court, he knows when it\ufffds time to speed up or to slow it down. He\ufffds the total package.\ufffd \ufffdI can be calm sometimes but I can also be an excitable \ufffd [I can be a] weird guy,\ufffd Willison said with a laugh. Hodgson also believes that Willison has the kind of outgoing personality that has helped raw more athletes into the volleyball program and keep the numbers strong. And maybe most importantly, he helps keep the experience enjoyable. \ufffdI love volleyball,\ufffd Willison said with a smile. \ufffdIt\ufffds a really fun sport to play.\ufffd, 348383=Frontier boys volleyball back in the final Buffalo News Sunday November 3, 2013, 312002=Section VI Playoff Bracket Class A Thursday November 7, 2013, 510572=In the men\ufffds final, No. 18 Dalhausser (Ormond Beach, Fla.) and Jennings (Las Vegas) lost a battle to Brazil\ufffds No. 2 Pedro Solberg Salgado and Bruno Oscar Schmidt, 23-21, 19-21, 15-13 in 1:07., 469402=St. Joe\ufffds volleyball Defeats Canisius Ken-Ton Bee Wednesday, October 23, 2013, 367602=Clarence\ufffds boys volleyball team took on a pair of foes in a bid to prepare for the playoffs and gain some positive momentum heading into the postseason, but the Red Devils instead will look to recapture the magic that led to their third-seed designation after falling short in both contests. Clarence\ufffds week began with a 27-29, 19-25, 22-25 loss to Frontier on Oct. 22. The Red Devils missed 10 serves in the opening game, which coach Kevin Starr identified as \ufffdthe beginning and the end of the story\ufffd in that setback. As frustrating as that was in and of itself, Starr said the reason that most of the misses occurred were \ufffdsimply from a lack of concentration \ufffd and that\ufffds simply not acceptable from a varsity team, especially this late in the season.\ufffd \ufffdFrontier is just too good a team for us to play less than our best and still expect to win,\ufffd Starr said. Senior outside hitter Brandon Hill had 11 kills to pace the Red Devils. Clarence then gave undefeated Division II champion Williamsville South \ufffd which had just defeated Division I co-champion West Seneca West in the recently-held Grand Island Tournament \ufffd a run for its money in Thursday\ufffds regular-season finale, falling in a 20-25, 22-25, 25-22, 25-27 decision. Senior outside hitter Dale Payne had 10 kills, while junior Tommy Ecker added six kills from the right side. Skyler Reinhardt had 23 assists, while junior Mason Sebian had 10 points serving and played a very solid game defensively. \ufffdThis was a terrific match, and we actually played very well for most of it,\ufffd Starr said. \ufffdWith a week to go before sectionals start, we needed to shake some things up, so after the Frontier match we went back to the one-setter offense that was successful for us at the beginning of the year. We also switched a couple players\ufffd positions in the rotation in hopes of finding the spark that we had back in early September. The one-setter offense worked pretty well against South, considering that we hadn\ufffdt used it in over a month.\ufffd Clarence will kick off its playoff run at 6 p.m. Thursday by hosting Orchard Park in a Class A quarterfinal. Whichever team wins that contestwilladvancetothesemifinalsatOrchardParkfora2p.m. contest against an unknown opponent. \ufffdNow it\ufffds time to start the \ufffdsecond season,\ufffd\ufffd Starr said. \ufffdIf we put our game together and all the guys play the way we know that they can, we have a great shot at winning the title. The same can be said, though, for six of the eight teams in the Class A bracket. Every one of them is good enough to win it all. That\ufffds been the story of this year: a high level of competition every night.\ufffd\u00a0, 310734=Class B Hamburg (26-2) lived up to its No. 1 ranking in Western New York by beating Williamsville South, 25-18, 22-25, 25-15, 25-19. The title was the first for the Bulldogs since 2009. Hamburg will play the Section V champion in the regionals on Saturday at 2 p.m. at Midlakes. When South tied the match at 1-1, the Bulldogs took it as a chance to refocus. \ufffdI wasn\ufffdt nervous, it was a little bit of a wakeup call,\ufffd said coach Brian Carroll. \ufffdSometimes you need to get smacked in the face a little bit.\ufffd Hamburg\ufffds Trevor Vail kept South on its heels with seven aces. Carroll said Doug Horbachewski made the most of his additional swings. The Billies ended their season 24-3, including the ECIC II crown at 12-0. South\ufffds Anthony Podgorsak dominated the net with 19 kills. \ufffdHe had great passing, a great attack, he\ufffds the heart of the team,\ufffd said South coach Thom Knab. \ufffdWhat we were really trying to do is spread it around as much as we could. We struggled a little with passing, so we weren\ufffdt always able to do that.\ufffd\u00a0 email: mmonnin@buffnews.com, 624342=St. Mary\ufffds volleyball stuns St. Joe\ufffds By: Buffalo News Tuesday September 17, 2013, 327530=For the first time since 2006, Williamsville South\ufffds boys volleyball team will be competing for a Section VI Class B title. The third-seeded Billies rebounded from a 23-25 loss in game one against second-seeded Eden to win the next three, 25-22, 25-13, 25-21, in Saturday\ufffds Class B semifinal meeting. South (24-2) faces top-seed Hamburg for the Class B title at 8 p.m. Wednesday at Hamburg High School. Billies coach Thom Knab said his team upped its defense in the second, third and fourth games and took advantage of Eden\ufffds problems serving the ball. Anthony Podgorsak and Steve Zaprowski paced the South offense with 21 and 14 kills, respectively. Christian Graziano added nine kills. Joe Zanelotti handed out 44 assists. It\ufffds the third year in a row that South has eliminated Eden in the playoffs. South downed 19th-seed Williamsville North, 25-11, 25-20, 25-21, in the prequarterfinals Oct. 29 and sixth-seeded Williamsville East, 25-15, 25-21, 25-22, in the quarterfinals Thursday. Podgorsak posted 13 kills, Zaprowski recorded nine kills and Zanelotti recorded eight blocks against Williamsville East. Podgorsak posted 12 kills and two aces against Williamsville North. Graziano added eight kills and eight blocks and Ryan Nigro had three aces. Throughout the postseason, Knab has been pleased with the leadership of Podgorsak and Zaprowski and the play of libero Kenny Stuber.\u00a0 Sweet Home The ninth-seeded Panthers hung tough in the first game of their quarterfinal game against top-seeded Hamburg Thursday before losing 15-25. Sweet Home dropped the next two games, 8-25, 15-25. \ufffdWe were ahead 4-0 and 14-12 in the first game. We were right with them,\ufffd Sweet Home coach Rich Cicero said. \ufffdBut Hamburg had a really good jump server and we struggled to pass and it led to our loss in the first game.\ufffd In the second game, Cicero said his team struggled to find an offense and made a lot of mental mistakes. Taylor Sutherland recorded seven kills and an ace and James Nix had three kills to pace the Panthers\ufffd offense. \ufffdWe couldn\ufffdt put the ball in the setter\ufffds hands and were limited to where we could put the ball,\ufffd Cicero said. \ufffdWe gave them too many down balls and free balls. You have to attack Hamburg, not give them ammunition.\ufffd Sweet Home advanced after winning at eighth-seeded Depew, 25-17, 25-21, 25-17, in the prequarterfinals\u00a0 Oct. 29. \ufffdOur kids passed well and executed the offense well,\ufffd Cicero said. Sutherland recorded 14 kills and four aces, Connor Heald had seven kills and Nix added six kills. Corey Allen recorded 27 assists. Sweet Home finished 12-7 overall and 8-4 in ECIC II. Five starters graduate, including Sutherland, who led the team with 270 kills, 51 aces and 97 stuffed blocks, Allen with 23 aces, Nix, Ben Miller and Justin Okun. \ufffdThe team met their goals and went beyond them,\ufffd Cicero said. \ufffdTo go 8-4 with a lot of new guys stepping in to start, I felt they did a really good job.\ufffd In another matter: Cicero will be inducted into the Western New York Volleyball Hall of Fame Thursday at Illio DiPaolo\ufffds Restaurant in Blasdell. \ufffdI\ufffdm very excited about it,\ufffd he said. \ufffdTo be recognized by a great group of guys and inducted into a hall of fame that has volleyball legends is quite an honor. I would not have thought that I would have made it this far.\ufffd Cicero has been Sweet Home\ufffds coach since 1999 and started Panther Volleyball Club in 2000. A captain and member of the first All-Western New York Team at Sweet Home, Cicero went on to play at Penn State where he was a team co-captain in his junior and senior years and the team was ranked first in the nation. It was the first time a team not from California was ranked first.\u00a0 Amherst\u00a0 The Tigers\ufffd season came to an end against West Seneca East in the Section VI Class B prequarterfinals Monday, losing 17-25, 26-24, 14-25, 19-25. Coach Peter Wlosinski said the team played well in its 25-19, 22-25, 16-25, 26-24, 26-28 home loss to East Aurora Oct. 22.\u00a0 \ufffdSeniors Evan Hall, Dante Merrill, Alex Touma and Greg Zimmermann will never forget their senior night against East Aurora,\ufffd coach Peter Wlosinski said.

The Tigers lost the next two games, 22-25 and 16-25, and rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth game to win 26-24. \ufffdWe came together and it was great to see our high level of enjoyment and competitiveness,\ufffd Wlosinski said. The fifth game went back and forth with Amherst losing 26-28. \ufffdWe lost but without a doubt, we played our best match of the season as a team,\ufffd Wlosinski said. \ufffdI was very proud to watch them play the game like I knew they were capable of all along.\ufffd Throughout the match, Amherst earned 31 kills, six blocks, 14 aces and 37 digs.

Front row players Ben Kutina and Thomas Bertoldini, meanwhile, \ufffdshut down some of the best hitters in Western New York with great blocking,\ufffd according to Cordes. Brian Willert and Trevor Bentley, meanwhile, \ufffdreceived a standing ovation from the raucous crowd\ufffd according to Cordes after they showcased solid serving down the stretch of the Blue Devils\ufffd 25-18, 25-9, 25-5 win over Holland two days earlier. \ufffdWe dominated that game from start to finish with strong play across the court,\ufffd Cordes said. East Aurora also showed it can swap roles at a moment\ufffds notice depending on the need any given night during its 24-26, 25-20, 20-25, 19-25 loss to Cheektowaga on Oct. 11. The Blue Devils were missing four starters that match, but Cordes said that \ufffdplayers stepped into positions they had never played before and played wonderfully, including passing specialists Sawyer Oubre and Colin Ruhland, and outside hitter turned setter David Yerofeev.\ufffd Another tough four-game loss came Oct. 3 at the hands of Depew. Senior captain Harry Hintz, who had come close to the school\ufffds single-game kill record on several occasions this season, was dominant with double-digit kills from the outside hitter position. Fellow senior hitter Kevin Tierney enjoyed similar success, according to Cordes. East Aurora closed out its regular season Tuesday at Amherst, but information about that contest was not available at press time. The Blue Devils\ufffd playoff fate was also not yet known when The Bee went to print., 687281=AVCA Division III Men's Coaches Top 15 Week #6 Poll: March 5, 2013 Tuesday, March 5, 2013, 611393=When the Kenmore West boys volleyball team steps onto the court this season it might very well have the most interesting blend of veterans and rookies of any team in the Niagara Frontier League. As the Blue Devils come into the 2013 season they will be led by senior co-captains Niko Mancuso and Mitch Maracle. Nick Atallah and Nester Pascua also return for Kenmore West. After that, well, it\ufffds what coach Gary Tocke has playfully dubbed his \ufffdgreen team.\ufffd Tyler Grandits, Noah Whalen, David Blumberg, Tyler Steubchen and 6-foot-5 Joe Gardon are all brand new to the world of varsity.\u00a0 In fact, Blumberg, Whalen and Grandits \ufffd who are in the West basketball program as well \ufffd have never played organized volleyball in their lives. But Tocke feels they all bring a combination of athletic ability and a desire to learn. When mixed with the returning veterans, it could add up to good things for the Blue Devils. The key, Tocke said, is for the newcomers to watch and learn from the veterans. \ufffdI tell the kids everyday, you guys that are green. Watch the guys that have played,\ufffd said Tocke. \ufffdYou might be a little bit taller than them. You might be able to jump a little higher. But guess what, they do things fundamentally a little better than you. So you can learn from them,\ufffd he added. Tocke said he tells the younger players to view the experienced guys as mentors. Maracle, who was pulled up to varsity late un his sophomore season said, that he and Mancuso are only too happy to help the newcomers in anyway they can. \ufffdThey\ufffdre front row players, so we\ufffdre trying to teach them how to hit well,\ufffd Maracle said. \ufffdAnd we\ufffdre helping them out in the back row and trying to help them get where they need to be.\ufffd As a whole, the Blue Devils appear to be on the same page and eager to not only learn from one another, but also play for each other as well.\u00a0 Most of all, as a group, the Blue Devils have said they have the mindset of \ufffdWe\ufffdre here. Let\ufffds do our best and not take any game for granted.\ufffd \ufffdWe\ufffdve got a couple of new players and we\ufffdre all a lot more enthusiastic and focused,\ufffd Maracle said. \ufffdAnd we want to win.

Long Beach State will need to contend with the losses of several key players, including Jim Baughman (230 kills), Brad Hemmerling (211 kills, 158 digs) and team digs leader Kyle McElderry (211 digs). While they were picked to finish sixth in the MPSF, one league coach called the squad a \ufffddark horse,\ufffd noting the team looked good during the fall season.

One coach observed that the Buckeyes may struggle early trying to replace their top two offensive threats from last year in Shawn Sangrey (548 kills) and Mik Berzins (278 kills), but the squad should progress and be much better by the end of the season. Grayson Overman is the team\ufffds top returning offensive producer with 141 kills and also last season\ufffds leading blocker (123 blocks). The Buckeyes also bring back setter Peter Heinen (10.67 assists per set), libero Michael Piechowski (119 digs), and middle blocker John Tholen (88 total blocks), along with a good group of young players who could make an immediate impact, including libero Brennan Anderson and opposite Andrew Lutz.

The Nittany Lions also add in five newcomers that all stand 6\ufffd4\ufffd\ufffd or better and also gain the services of 6-foot-4 redshirt freshman Taylor Hammond as setter and 6-foot-9 Matt Seifert in the middle. Penn State will have to contend with the losses of Joe Sunder (338 kills) and Edgardo Goas (11.11 assists per set, .318 hitting percentage) but bring back Nick Goodell (237 kills) and Aaron Russell (203 kills, 92 blocks), along with Connor Curry (225 digs) on the defense. The Lions will know where they stand early as they travel to the islands to take on UCLA, Hawaii, and Ohio State to kick off the season, and then return home to host Lewis and Loyola.

Maurice Torres and Josh Taylor, who led the offense last year with 450 and 363 kills, respectively, are back, as is setter Matt West (11.38 assists per game), and libero Mike McMahon (116 digs), along with several other players who saw significant action last year. The Waves will have to contend with the loss of Chase Ross (230 kills, 125 digs) and Matt Pollock (225 kills, team high 129 blocks) and will get tested early as they open with UC Irvine on Jan. 8 and play only one non-conference match after that.\u00a0 Stanford 2012 Record: 22-7\u00a0 2012 Postseason: 3-2 loss to UC Irvine in the MPSF Championship\u00a0 Head Coach: John Kosty\u00a0 Career Record: 106-69 (six seasons)\u00a0 Key Returners: Brian Cook (Jr., OH, 6'5\"), Steven Irvin (Jr., OH, 6'5\"), Eric Mochalski (Jr., MB, 6'5\"), Jake Kneller (Jr., OH, 6'1\") Key Losses: Erik Shoji (L), Brad Lawson (OH), Evan Barry (S), Gus Ellis (MH) Snapshot: The Cardinal bring back three starters and nine letterwinners to a squad that fell in five sets in the MPSF Final to eventual national champion UC Irvine. The league coaches picked Stanford to finish fourth, but the Cardinal will need to fill a lot of holes left by graduation. Gone are Erik Shoji (304 digs), the first-ever four-time AVCA First Team All-American, and Brad Lawson (451 kills), a three-time AVCA First Team All-American, along with key players Evan Barry (12.04 assists per set) and Gus Ellis (101 blocks). But remaining for Stanford are three of the four top offensive producers in Brian Cook (367 kills), Steven Irvin (324 kills), and Eric Mochalski (215 kills, 100 blocks). A strength for Stanford will be their ball control, according to one league coach. Also going for the Cardinal is a strong recruiting class that includes setter/outside hitter James Shaw, a U.S. Youth National Team standout who is also the son of former Stanford men\ufffds and women\ufffds head coach Don Shaw.

First-year head coach David Kniffin\ufffds squad was picked to finish first in the conference again but will have to replace offensive leader Carson Clark (414 kills, 61 aces) along with blocking leader Dan McDonnell (100 blocks). Chris Austin and Daniel Stork are back to direct the offense (828 and 589 assists, respectively) while Michael Brinkley (199 digs) paced the defense last year. Like most West Coast schools this year, the Anteaters play mainly conference competition, which could test the squad early, especially with half the roster being either freshmen or sophomores.

The longtime coach retired after a career of helping shape the sport across Western New York, but will still be active as a volunteer assistant coach with the women\ufffds volleyball team at Canisius College.\u00a0 Stefani led Orchard Park to a 559-159 record (a .779 winning percentage), won 17 ECIC championships, nine Section VI Class A titles, and three intersectional matches. He retired from teaching at OP in 2012. He was coach of the Quakers for all but five seasons since 1979 and was the boys basketball coach from 1985-1994. His volleyball teams were undefeated in 1991 (25-0) and 2008 (34-0). In 2011 he was inducted into the WNY Men\ufffds Volleyball Hall of Fame. He\ufffds a seven-time WNY Coach of the Year.

The Raiders are accomplishing feats over and over again that most programs would be good with doing just once. It seems we\ufffdve gotten so used to Eden winning state titles, it becomes commonplace to take these accomplishments for granted. Eden coasted through the state\ufffds final four \ufffd without losing a set \ufffd during the weekend, to win a fifth straight state title and seven in nine seasons. It\ufffds the program\ufffds 11th overall; eighth, as a Class C team. There is such precision, attention to detail and an air of confidence that goes into every run and, when it ends with a state title, it almost seems to have become more expected than appreciated. In actuality, this may be the most impressive run for a program since the era of state championship tournaments began in New York in the early 1990s. This is as close to perfection you\ufffdll see at the high school sports level and it is all happening right here, in the small hidden-gem of a town called Eden. \ufffdWe consider ourselves a small school playing at a AA-size level,\ufffd said head coach Stephen Pierce. Pierce is the driving force behind most of his players\ufffd competing at the highest of levels, also encouraging them to play in club, many with Niagara Frontier Volleyball, which is also second to none in building and enhancing talent. Pierce also coaches and is on the board of directors with the NFVC. There is year-round playing talent every season at Eden, which makes the program head and shoulders above similar-sized programs in the growing sport, but to have this much success at such a high level goes beyond solely talent. Pierce pinpointed two factors in Eden\ufffds success: expectations and culture. This team is held to a different standard, that which is required to win championship after championship. There\ufffds a certain level of play expected, which leaves some in awe and others uncomfortable, at times. To see a coach finding fault with a team that\ufffds thoroughly dominating a match can elicit some uneasiness, but Pierce demands the best from his players at all times, regardless of the opponent\ufffds strength. \ufffdEven in a 20 \ufffd 5 set, the girls understand [that], if we don\ufffdt play to a certain standard, there\ufffds an issue,\ufffd Pierce said. \ufffdIf the girls play a point casually, it\ufffds not about, \ufffdOh well, we still won.\ufffd It\ufffds about playing to an acceptable standard.\ufffd And then there\ufffds the ownership that every player on the team seems to willingly take on. Pierce said that each new generation of team leaders are interested in leaving a path for others to follow, just like teammates before them did.\u00a0 It provides each player with a sense of responsibility, especially when younger eyes are watching. Pierce also said that the maturity of older players each season is very helpful to the coaching staff. \ufffdI don\ufffdt have a lot of rules; I don\ufffdt have to because the juniors and seniors do that for me,\ufffd Pierce said. \ufffdThat\ufffds what we\ufffdre all about here.\ufffd Of course, a team of this standard has been able to accomplish quite a bit individually, as well. Starting with 2009 graduate Heather Henry, who played for North Carolina, Eden has had a remarkable number of players go off to play for Division I programs, some at major schools. By my count, it\ufffds now seven, if you include recent Penn State signee Lainy Pierce. That also includes Stacey Smith (2010), a senior at Georgia; Hannah Herc (2010), a senior at Kent State, Hailee Herc (2010), a senior at Stony Brook, Heather Feldman (2011), a junior at Gardner-Webb and Kendall Pierce (2012), a sophomore at Penn State, who will soon be reunited with her sister. No surprise: The Pierce girls are the nieces of Stephen Pierce and daughters of Robert Pierce, a former Penn State men\ufffds volleyball player himself, who demands much of the same level of play from his boys volleyball program at Eden. In a way, the Eden volleyball program seems to be an extension of the Pierce family\ufffds standards and values. It takes discipline and dedication to maintain these expectations and a culture, which are the framework of all of the successes Eden has experienced. It may not be a fit for every student-athlete, but for the right person, the lessons learned while playing in this program can also help create some separation from others, in how that person carries one\ufffds self in life., 39873=The NCAA Men's Division III Championships will take place this weekend...

The starting lineup is almost brand new as the program graduated five starters last season. \ufffdThe parity this year is something that hasn't been seen since the 1980s,\ufffd said head coach Matt Lexner. \ufffdWe are off to a slower start than others, but recently we have started to compete a lot better.\ufffd The Quakers lost to eighth ranked Clarence in four games and then barely lost to third ranked West Seneca West in five games. \ufffdWe are hoping to break through this week,\ufffd said Lexner. \ufffdOur biggest strength so far has been our blocking. If we can get our floor game and passing up to that level, a lot of things will start rolling our way.\ufffd Orchard Park is led by their only returning starter, setter Nolan McArdle. \ufffdHe is our captain, a great competitor and is able to raise his teammates level of play,\ufffd said Lexner.

The Section VI-champion Lockport Lions will take on the Section V-champion Fairport Red Raiders at 4 p.m. today at Midlakes High School in the state\ufffds Far West Regionals. The winner will compete in the state tourney finals at the Glens Falls Civic Center on Nov. 15. Head coach John O\ufffdDell\ufffds No. 2 Red Raiders made history on Thursday by defeating top-seeded McQuaid 25-21, 26-24, 22-25, 25-22 at Webster Schroeder High School to win the Section V Class A title, their first sectional championship in program history. Head coach Joe Whalen\ufffds No. 2 Lions also made history this week, claiming their first-ever Section VI Class A title with a straight-set, 25-21, 25-18, 25-21 victory Wednesday over No. 5 Frontier at Hamburg High School. Fairport, like Lockport, features a senior-laden roster with 12 on the team (The Lions have 11 seniors), led by 6-3 senior setter Mitch Kennedy, who was named Most Valuable Player of the V Tournament, recording 25 assists in the finals. Topping the Red Raiders in kills against the three-pete-champion Knights were 6-5 junior outside hitter Jamie Wolmering (18 kills) and 6-3 senior middle hitter Josh Holm (14 kills). Whalen said despite the similarities, there are significant differences in the two programs and two sections for that matter. \ufffdIn Section V, they play a much more aggressive serving type of game than we do here in Section VI. Everyone jump serves. We have a lot more float servers in our league and on our team,\ufffd said Whalen, who witnessed the V title match in person. \ufffdFairport has a real good serving team. That will be one of our challenges \ufffd to meet their serving with good passing. They have some height as well. They don\ufffdt have anyone as tall as Jason (Lockport\ufffds 6-8 middle hitter Donorovich), but they have a couple of good players with height.\ufffd Among the keys to victory for the Lions today is getting past Fairport\ufffds strong serving. Lockport is led by First Team All-NFL all-stars Donorovich and Brad Schneider, both juniors, and senior libero Eamon Yates; Second Team All-NFL all-stars Jack Whalen and Bryce Perry, both seniors; and Third Team All-NFL all-stars Shawn Moore and Jonah Ribbeck, also seniors. \ufffdBeyond the serves, if we get onto a hard game and pass their balls fine, we can compete with them and match up with them,\ufffd Whalen said. \ufffdWe\ufffdre a better blocking team and they\ufffdre a stronger serving team. Wolmering is a cool cookie. He\ufffds good and they\ufffdll go to him a lot. Their setter Kennedy and libero are also good players. \ufffdThey\ufffdve got a great program and I enjoyed watching them,\ufffd Whalen said. \ufffdI told my kids, \ufffdYou don\ufffdt get to the state finals by walking by everyone. You have to play the game of your life every match. Don\ufffdt assume these guys are going to be a walk in the park.\ufffd \ufffd The Lions will leave by bus at 12:45 p.m. today and arrive at Midlakes about two hours later, Whalen said. \ufffdThey\ufffdre going to play their hardest,\ufffd Whalen said. \ufffdThese kids appreciate a good squad, but they\ufffdre not awed. And they appreciate the experience they\ufffdre going through. I\ufffdm personally more relaxed for this match than I was for the sectional finals match. Our goal was never to get to states. It was only to get to sectionals and be that team. Everything from here on in is like gravy. From now on, we\ufffdre playing for ourselves and we\ufffdll see what happens.\ufffd, 275975=Frontier\ufffds run of upsets ends in boys volleyball final By: Johnathan Snyder, Reporter | Sports Friday November 15, 2013, 666987=Playing volleyball is a full time activity that Devin is passionate about. As an 8th grader this past season he played on the JV team for Lake Shore. He was pulled up to the Varsity team at the end of the season and got an opportunity to participate in a Sectional Championship, Regional Championship, and a trip to Glens Falls for the State Tournament. During the offseason Devin plays club volleyball with Eden. Through his participation with Eden VBC, he was made aware of a unique opportunity. He attended a USA High Performance Tryout in Rochester to see if he would make one of the 3 teams: National USA 14U Team (top 12 players), A1 Team (next ranked 40 players), and the A2 Team (next ranked 80 players). There were 36 tryouts spread out over 26 states. After the 3 hour tryout, he found out that he was selected to play for the highest level, the USA National 14U Team. This USA National 14U Team consists of the top 12 ranked volleyball players from all over the country and Puerto Rico who attended the tryouts.

He is one of the top outside hitters in Section VI and is an effective option when we need a crucial kill.

Sean, or as he is known now, Commanding Officer Burke attended and graduated from the United States Naval Academy with a B.A. in Science and Officer Commission in 1997. There, Burke started for the Naval Academy Volleyball Team playing six seasons. A few years later, Burke participated in the Military World Games in Catania, Italy and in Kingston, Ontario playing volleyball and representing the United States of America. C.D.R. Burke\ufffds first tour of duty was aboard the USS Juneau (LPD 10) where he served as a Weapons\ufffd Division Officers and deployed for a hull swap with the USS Dubuque (LPD 8) in Sasebo, Japan.

The top-seeded Bulldogs used a third set rally to seize back momentum, and beat the No. 3 seed Williamsville South in four, to capture their first Section VI Class B championship, since 2009. \"It's been a long time,\" said Hamburg head coach Brian Carroll. \"It feels really good. I'm just really happy for the boys. To win a sectional title with a sophomore setter [Ryan Dils], that means the seniors had to step up, the juniors had to step up, and when you win with a sophomore leading your team, it doesn't happen very often.\" The teams split the first two sets, and the third proved to be match-changing. With Hamburg leading, 12-7, the Billies rallied for four consecutive points, which led to a Bulldog timeout. Out of the timeout, Hamburg went on a 9-0 run, and finished the game scoring 13 out of the final 17 points, to win 25-15. \"The flood gates opened up,\" said Carroll about the beginning of the third set run. \"We got a few blocks and made them uncomfortable. When we blocked them, they didn't react real well, and the points just came a little easier.\" Hamburg won the first game, 25-18, with the Billies firing back with a 25-22 win in the second. After Hamburg flexed its muscles in the third game, the Bulldogs finished off the visiting Billies in the fourth, with a 25-19 victory, which also included a 6-0 run to finish. Williamsville South head coach Thom Knab thought his team was going to climb out of another hole, like they had all season long, but Hamburg wouldn't allow that to happen. Knab praised the Bulldogs and their ability not to allow the Billies to gain an edge. \"Hamburg is a really, really well-coached, solid team,\" Knab said. \"They're so good at passing, and they're so good defensively, and they have some big hitters that you really have to be focused on. You can't let up, even a little bit.\" The Billies, who went undefeated in ECIC play throughout the regular season, were very resilient, said Carroll, and presented a number of different challenges. They finished the season with an overall mark of 24-3, and showed why they were such a tough out this the season. \"They brought a lot of serving,\" senior captain Trevor Vail said. \"They had great serving. Their passing was there and their hitting, they had incredible hitting. We found a way to get through it and battle through.\" Junior middle hitter Zach Yerrington and captains Vail and Doug Horbachewski came up with a number of crucial blocks at the net which led to many points throughout the third and fourth games. Carroll noted a block by Yerrington late in the fourth put Hamburg ahead for good. Dils, the setter and leader on the floor for the Bulldogs, matured throughout the season according to his coaches and teammates. Playing arguably the most difficult and important position on the floor, Dils proved that he was up for any and all challenges, including having a big match in the finals. \"He's gotten so much better from when we started,\" Yerrington said. \"He's improved so much and he's a big part of our team.\" The Hamburg faithful stormed the court after the final point was awarded. Although exhausted, players rode their adrenaline while celebrating the victory. \"It feels unbelievable,\" Horbachewski said. \"We worked so hard in the offseason and we came here and did what we were supposed to do \ufffd win the championship.\" The Bulldogs will travel to Midlakes High School in Clifton Springs for the regional finals on Saturday, Nov. 9, to take on the winner of Victor and Brighton., 205067=USA Volleyball - 2014 Boys High Performance Tryout Schedule, 254110=Clarence\ufffds boys volleyball team officially put the finishing touches on its 2013 season recently when it held its annual awards banquet on Nov. 17.

The team also became the first squad in the 27-year history of the Clarence Invitational to win the tournament. Senior middle hitter Ted Okon had 94 blocks and a .612 hitting percentage, both of which were the second-highest single-season efforts in team history. Okon was also a Second Team ECIC I All-star because of his efforts. Senior Brandon Hill, the team leader in kills, and senior Dale Payne, the team leader in serve attempts, points serving and spike attempts, was both First Team ECIC I All-stars.

The tournament was set up with four pools, each with four teams. There was high level competition in each pool, highlighted by McQuaid from Rochester, which is the defending Section V and state champion in Division I. The individual talent, along with the overall team talent, was noteworthy, according to Pierce. The tournament featured many players who are part of the USA volleyball program and have lengthy family histories in the sport. \ufffdWe were really honored that they invited us to come here,\ufffd Fusar said. \ufffdSchedules and conflicts kind of prevented us from coming. Then [Pierce] invited us back this year and we were glad to make it. It\ufffds really one of the best tournaments in the whole state. We got to play the top teams in Buffalo and two other top teams from the Rochester area. We got to play a lot of top schools. It was a great opportunity for my kids.\ufffd Eden, which is a smaller Division II school, competed against some of the large Division I schools. During the quarterfinals against McQuaid, after falling in the first set, the Raiders rallied to win the second, 33 \ufffd 31, before eventually losing the decisive third set. \ufffdWe put it together and played one of our best matches against that McQuaid team,\ufffd Pierce said. \ufffdIt was fun.\ufffd Eden is a nine-time winner of the tournament, which leads all schools. McQuaid is a two-time winner with its most recent title in 2011, with a victory against Frontier in the finals. The Falcons are also a three-time winner of the event, including taking a title in 2012. The tournament is a true test of not only volleyball skill, but of mental toughness and stamina, according to Pierce. Fairport played 11 matches of volleyball, to win the championship. The tournament started at 8 a.m. and finished a little before 6. Locals Declan Pierce of Eden, the coach\ufffds son, and Dylan Durni of Frontier, were named to the all-tournament team.

The Indians, who also beat Clarence in five games earlier this season, jumped out to an early lead in the decisive game, but the Red Devils were able to chip away to have a shot in the end. Unfortunately, according to coach Kevin Starr, Clarence was called for some ball handling violations within the final three points. \ufffdWe knew when the season started that West was going to be at the top of the league, but this loss was extra tough because we had a two games to one lead on them,\ufffd Starr said. \ufffdWest serves very, very well, and we just weren\ufffdt able to run our offense effectively. We were able to neutralize their two big hitters much better this time than we had the first time we played, so we like our chances if we see them again.\ufffd Outside hitters Brandon Hill and Dale Payne had big nights for Clarence, with 15 and 14 kills, respectively. Middle hitter Ted Okon had eight blocks. Clarence returned to action Tuesday with its Senior Night match against Frontier, but information about that contest was not available at press time.

I think it\ufffds great to get high-caliber teams in our arena so our fans can see us compete against them.\ufffd\u00a0 Berzins Bros: For the past six years, Loyola\ufffds roster has featured a Berzins brother. Kris Berzins competed for the Ramblers from 2007-10 and is currently one of their assistant coaches. His younger brother, Dainis Berzins, joined Loyola\ufffds roster in 2011. PENN STATE 2013 Record: 23-8\u00a0 2013 Postseason: NCAA Semifinalist\u00a0 Head Coach: Mark Pavlik (460-134,\u00a0 20th season)\u00a0 Key Returners: Connor Curry (RS Jr., L), Taylor Hammond (RS So., S), Aaron Russell (Jr. MB), Peter Russell (Sr., OH), Matt Seifert (RS So., MB)\u00a0 Key Losses: Tom Comfort (Opp.), Nick Turko (MB)\u00a0 Key Newcomers: Aiden Albrecht (Fr., Opp.), Matt Callaway (RS Fr., MB/Opp.), Joey Farrell (Fr., OH), Kevin Gear (Fr., MB), Chris Nugent (Fr., OH), Jalen Penrose (Fr., OH), Andrew Roberts (RS Fr., Opp.), Spencer Sauter (RS Fr., OH)\u00a0 Notes on Penn State: Expect another postseason run from this young, improving team. The Nittany Lions return five players from their 23-8, NCAA Semifinalist squad and bring in a slew of newcomers. Penn State will have to account for the loss of Turko (81k, 66b) and Comfort (185k, 37b), but returning players in critical positions will ease the transition as new players step up and fill those roles. Aaron Russell (366k, 180d, 47b) is back to pace the offense after leading Penn State in kills last season. The Nittany Lions also return top-blocker Seifert (163k, 77b). Curry (259d) will continue to frustrate opponents with his scrappy defense, while Hammond (1,172a) is back to quarterback the offense.\u00a0 Coach on the team: \ufffdThis year our starters will be youthfully experienced, but our depth is going to be inexperienced, so I think it\ufffds going to be a situation where this team is really going to gel about a month or two into the season when we really get used to what we\ufffdre facing.\ufffd\u00a0 Unstoppable: Penn State tabbed their 15th-straight EIVA championship title last season. The Nittany Lions now have 25 EIVA titles to their name. PEPPERDINE 2013 Record: 14-12\u00a0 2013 Postseason: MPSF Quarterfinalist\u00a0 Head Coach: Marv Dunphy (546-241, 31st season)\u00a0 Key Returners: Nikola Antonijevic (Jr., MB), Parker Kalmbach (RS Jr., MB), Ryan Plueger (Sr., L), Matt Tarantino (RS So., MB/Opp.), Josh Taylor (Jr., OH), Matt West (Jr., S)\u00a0 Key Losses: Maurice Torres (Opp.)\u00a0 Key Newcomers: Brennan Anderson (Jr., L), Soren Dion-Kindem (Fr., S), James Gehrels (Fr., OH), Chad McCallister (Fr., L), Mitchell Penning (Fr., MB), Max States (Fr., OH)\u00a0 Notes on Pepperdine: The Waves boast an experienced, upperclassmen-dominated squad. Five starters return from last season\ufffds 14-12 team along with Ohio State transfer Anderson, who set the Buckeyes\ufffd record for average career digs and single-season digs. In addition, MPSF All-Freshman Team selection Tarantino returns to the court after redshirting last season. First Team All-American West (1,114a) will continue to orchestrate the offense, while last season\ufffds top blocker Kalmbach (173k, 121b) is back to defend the net. With the graduation of kills leader Torres (417k, 82b, 154d), the Waves will likely call on Taylor (305k, 123d, 58b) to carry the offense. Plueger (148d) returns as a feisty backcourt defender.\u00a0 Coach on the team: \ufffdWe have to contend with the loss of Maurice Torres, who led our team in kills and aces during his four years here. If we can stay healthy, I think we will be in the thick of it.\ufffd\u00a0 Making Olympic Waves: Pepperdine has been represented on the U.S. Men\ufffds National Volleyball Team every quad since 1984. STANFORD 2013 Record: 15-13\u00a0 2013 Postseason: N.A.\u00a0 Head Coach: John Kosty (121-82, eighth season)\u00a0 Key Returners: Brian Cook (Sr., OH), Grant Delgado (RS Jr., L), Denny Falls (Sr., MB), Spencer Haly (Jr., MB), Madison Hayden (So., OH), Steven Irvin (Sr., OH), Eric Mochalski (Sr., MB/Opp.), Scott Sakaida (RS Jr., L), James Shaw (So., S/OH), Daniel Tublin (RS Jr., OH)\u00a0 Key Losses: Jake Kneller (OH)\u00a0 Key Newcomers: Cole Fiers (Fr., S), Clay Jones (Fr., OH), Colin McCall (Fr., OH), Kevin Rakestraw (Fr., MB)\u00a0 Notes on Stanford: An experienced Stanford squad will take the court this winter. Ten of 16 returners saw significant court time last season, including All-Americans Cook (First Team, 417k, 148d, 62b) and Irvin (Second Team, 344k, 183d, 45b). The Cardinal lost a valuable role player in Kneller (69k, 96d, 25b) but should be able to compensate for the loss with their deep bench and strong incoming class. Blocking leader Mochalski (179k, 88b) returns to defend the net, while Delgado (146d) brings experience to the backcourt. Shaw (1,027a) will likely continue to start at setter, but could be called on to hit as well. Add four talented newcomers to the mix and the 2014 Cardinal squad is poised to contend with the best.\u00a0 Coach on the team: \ufffdI would describe this version of the Cardinal as skilled, athletic, and experienced. We have two strong setters that can now be considered veterans and a solid core of outsides and opposites that are fairly interchangeable.\ufffd\u00a0 Worst to First: Since taking over as head coach in 2007, John Kosty has completely transformed the Stanford men\ufffds volleyball program. He took the Cardinal from a three-win season in 2007 to an NCAA Championship title in 2010.\u00a0 UC IRVINE 2013 Record: 25-7\u00a0 2013 Postseason: NCAA Champions\u00a0 Head Coach: David Kniffin (25-7, second season)\u00a0 Key Returners: Michael Brinkley (Jr., L), Jeremy Dejno (Sr., OH), Connor Hughes (Sr., OH), Scott Kevorken (Sr., MB), Zack La Cavera (Jr., Opp.), Collin Mehring (Sr., MB), Daniel Stork (Sr., S), Travis Woloson (Jr., OH)\u00a0 Key Losses: Chris Austin (S), Kevin Tillie (OH)\u00a0 Key Newcomers: Andrew Benz (Fr., MB), Reid Dominguez (Fr., OH), Phillip Friedman (Fr., OH), Tamir Hershko (Fr., Opp.), Dillon Hoffman (Fr., L), Tucker Pikula (Fr., OH), Michael Saeta (Fr., Opp.), Ben Sebastian (Fr., MB), Austin Vaickus (Fr., Opp.), Marius Wollan (Fr., OH)\u00a0 Notes on UC Irvine: In his first year at the helm, Kniffin led the Anteaters to their second consecutive NCAA championship title. This season, 10 letterwinners and nine newcomers take the court to vie for a three-peat. AVCA First Team All-American Brinkley (290d) returns to pace the defense, while AVCA Second Team All-American Mehring (188k, 134b) along with Kevorken (178k, 122b) and La Cavera (280k, 112d, 69b) add experience to the front line. UC Irvine lost key offensive players with the graduation of Austin (611a) and AVCA First Team All-American Tillie (395k, 64b, 179d), so returning outsides Dejno (241k, 80d, 64b) and Hughes (195k, 92d, 55b) will need to step up and carry more of the offensive load. Stork (737a) will likely remain in the conversation for starting setter.\u00a0 Coach on the team: \ufffdThe competitive objective to win a national championship remains the same, but it will be a different journey. The dynamics have shifted, but the sum of the parts is equal to last year.\ufffd\u00a0 League-Of-Almost-His-Own: In the 44-year history of NCAA men\ufffds volleyball, David Kniffin is the second head coach to claim the national title in his first season. UCLA 2013 Record: 21-11\u00a0 2013 Postseason: MPSF Semifinalist\u00a0 Head Coach: John Speraw (21-11, second season)\u00a0 Key Returners: Trent Kersten (RS So., MB), Steve O\ufffdDell (So., S), Robart Page (Sr., OH), Clayton Paullin (RS Jr., MB), Gonzalo Quiroga (Sr., OH), Spencer Rowe (Sr., MB)\u00a0 Key Losses: Connor Bannan (S), Evan Mottram (L), Dane Worley (OH)\u00a0 Key Newcomers: Jackson Bantle (Fr., OH), Grant Chalmers (Fr., L), Oliver Martin (Fr., OH), Jake Reeves (Fr., S), Hagen Smith (Fr., S), Eric Sprague (Fr., MB), Mitch Stahl (Fr., MB)\u00a0 Notes on UCLA: The Bruins spent last season adjusting to a new coaching staff, but the future is bright for this talented squad. UCLA returns six key members of their MPSF semifinalist squad and brings in arguably the strongest recruiting class in the country, including two of the nation\ufffds top-five recruits (according to VBM\ufffds Fab 50) in Stahl and Martin. AVCA First Team All-American Quiroga (420k, 146d, 58b) along with Page (356k, 162d, 56b) are back to pace the offense, while AVCA Second-Team All American Rowe (213k, 112) returns as a force at the net. The defensive contribution of AVCA Second Team All-American Mottram (267d) and consistent offensive production of Worley (307k, 160d, 52b) will be missed, but UCLA\ufffds deep roster should be able to pick up the slack.\u00a0 Coach on the schedule: \ufffdWe\ufffdve got a great schedule this season, particularly in the pre-conference season where we\ufffdll travel to the Santa Barbara tournament and the Outrigger Hotels Invitational. These events will give us an opportunity to try different lineup combinations as well as expose our team to playing away from home. With eight new players, competition on the road is invaluable.\u00a0 Red, White, and Bruin: Bruins\ufffd head coach John Speraw also leads the U.S. Men\ufffds National Team. Talk about a jam-packed schedule. USC 2013 Record: 6-18\u00a0 2013 Postseason: N.A.\u00a0 Head Coach: Bill Ferguson (115-82, eighth season)\u00a0 Key Returners: Joey Booth (RS Jr., OH), Henry Cassiday (Sr., L/OH), Micah Christenson (Jr., S), Robert Feathers (Jr., MB), Tanner Jansen (RS Sr., Opp.), Cristian Rivera (Jr., OH/Opp.),\u00a0 Key Losses: J.B. Green (L), Ben Lam (MB), Chris Trefzger (S)\u00a0 Key Newcomers: Andy Benesh (Fr., MB), Riley Mallon (Fr., L/OH), Jack Yoder (Fr., S), Lucas Yoder (Fr., OH)\u00a0 Notes on USC: After spending the 2013 season rebuilding and developing young players, USC should be back on the national radar in 2014. The Trojans will have to replace role players in Lam (57K, 41b), Trefzger (100a), and Green (45d), but world-class setter Christenson (867a) is back to run the show. Christenson isn\ufffdt just a phenomenal setter: he also led the team in digs (179) and aces (41) in 2013. Also back is top hitter Jansen (241k, 65d, 48b) and blocker Feathers (170k, 76b), along with starting libero Cassiday (108d). Add in the consistent play of Rivera (193k, 66d, 32b) and Booth (156k, 59d, 19b) and a smattering of talented newcomers, and this USC squad is poised for a breakout season.\u00a0 Coach on the team: \ufffdOur expectation for the 2014 season is that we will finish with a record closer to what we had in 2012, when we advanced to the NCAA final four for the third time in a four-year span.\ufffd\u00a0 What I Did Over My Summer Vacation (And Fall Semester): Junior setter Micah Christenson spent his summer (and fall) setting for the U.S. Men\ufffds National Team. He could very well be on the court in the next Olympics. Player of the Year Candidates Three names consistently came to the forefront when discussing the nation\ufffds top players.\u00a0 Micah Christenson Jr., S, 6'5\", USC, Honolulu, Hawaii\u00a0 Arguably the best setter in the nation, Christenson led a rebuilding USC squad to a .228 hitting efficiency last season. He nabbed Second Team All-MPSF honors and led the Trojans with 867 assists, 179 digs, and 41 aces. His 59 total blocks were good for second best on the team. Christenson spent his summer competing with the U.S. Men\ufffds National Team. He set the national team to a first-place finish at the NORCECA Continental Championship and a fifth-place finish in the FIVB Grand Champions Cup in Japan. Taylor Crabb\u00a0 Sr., OH, 6'0\", Long Beach State, Honolulu, Hawaii\u00a0 Crabb earned his first-ever All-American recognition in 2013 when he stormed onto the scene and claimed AVCA First Team All-American and Player of the Year honors. The outside hitter was an instrumental part of the 49ers\ufffd 24-8 season and MPSF championship appearance. Ranked third in the nation with 4.18 kills per set, Crabb blasted 20 or more kills in eight matches last season. His .353 hitting percentage was in the top-10 nationwide. Also a strong defender, Crabb posted 209 digs, good for second best on his team, and 72 blocks.\u00a0 Taylor Sander\u00a0 Sr., OH, 6'4\", BYU, Huntington Beach, Calif.\u00a0 An AVCA First Team All-American and MPSF and VBM Player of the Year in 2013, Sander led his BYU squad to an MPSF conference title and NCAA championship appearance. The three-time All-American notched a team-high 461 kills on 947 attempts for a .333 hitting efficiency. His 3.94 kills per set rank fifth best in the nation, and he posted 20 kills or more in five matches. He also posted a team best 178 digs (1.52 digs per set) and tabbed 93 blocks and 42 service aces.\u00a0, 113009=Hawaii Warrior Men Volleyball 2014 - #10 Hawaii Vs UCSD\u00a0 UHVolleyBallFanToo Saturday, January 25, 2014, 750328=They tied Pakmen from Ontario, CA for third and clinched their invite to the final tournament of the season in early July., 278854=Whalens guide Lockport boys volleyball\ufffds first sectional title By: Johnathan Snyder, Reporter | Sports Thursday November 14, 2013, 630247=Eden one of final WNY survivors as host of Pan-Am volleyball tourney By: Johnathan Snyder, Reporter | Sports Thursday September 12, 2013, 252290=West names October\ufffds top athletes West Seneca Bee Thursday November 28, 2013, 370404=St Joe's Tops St Francis Ken-Ton Bee Wednesday October 30, 2013, 576581=WSW nabs key win By: Buffalo News Wednesday September 25, 2013, 107705=Eden 14U Win Lockport Winter Challenge Monday February 10, 2014, 38367=Paul Syta, a 6-2 setter for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a senior from Fairport, N.Y.

MIT is ranked No. 6 in the latest AVCA Coaches Poll, and have remained in the top-10 since the third week of the year. Syta garners AVCA All-American accolades for the first time. J.P. Tulaka, a 6-5 middle blocker for Carthage College, is a sophomore from Westmont, Ill. His .484 hitting percentage, 1.95 kills per set and 0.86 blocks per set were good enough to be named to the All-CVC West Division Team and his first AVCA All-American award. In Carthage's regular season finale against the College of Mount St. Joseph, Tulaka smashed 10 kills on .471 hitting. Steven Woessner, a 6-5 middle blocker for SUNY New Paltz, is a freshman from Massapequa Park, N.Y. He garnered Sports Imports/AVCA Player of the Week honors last week as he helped the Hawks win their first ever UVC Conference Tournament.

The Panthers are 3-1 in ECIC II with wins over Iroquois, Lake Shore and Starpoint and a loss in four games against division leader Williamsville South. They are 6-2 overall with non-league victories over Kenmore East, Kenmore West and Williamsville North and a loss to Clarence. Coach Rich Cicero attributes the early-season success to the players\ufffd hard work, willingness to accept their roles on the team and keeping down unforced errors. Leading the Panthers\ufffd offense is outside hitter Taylor Sutherland. He recorded eight kills against Iroquois and 11 versus Lake Shore. \ufffdHe\ufffds a versatile player that does a lot for our offense,\ufffd Cicero said. \ufffdHe hits hard enough to be a dominating player for us.\ufffd Senior outside hitters Ben Miller and Connor Heald have also done a great job of making smart decisions when they attack the ball, Cicero said. Cicero is also impressed with the development of senior middle hitter James Nix. \ufffdHe\ufffds been working on other aspects of his game,\ufffd Cicero said. \ufffdHe\ufffds learning how to hit in different sets, and that has paid off for us. But for a kid that has never played before, he\ufffds unbelievable. He tries to make the right play every time.

Ohio State \ufffd The expectations are always high for the Buckeyes, especially after being upset last year in the postseason. Ohio State should be a fun team to watch this year with some of its new recruits and will continue to improve throughout the year. Grand Canyon \ufffd Not many people outside of Arizona have high expectations for Grand Canyon. Don\ufffdt tell that to the Antelopes or their coaching staff, though, because they all believe they can make a deep postseason run in 2014. Ball State \ufffd Ball State has one of the best middle tandems in the nation with All-American middle attackers Kevin Owens and Matt Leske. However, the Cardinals\ufffd shot at contending for a MIVA title depends on its ability for develop its young outside attackers into all-conference caliber players. IPFW \ufffd Coach Arnie Ball told The News-Sentinel recently that he didn\ufffdt want to retire because of the talent on his roster. The Hall of Fame isn\ufffdt exaggerating.

There were high expectations for Almario to remain one of the best heading into the 2014 season, and he did not disappoint. He ranks in the top-10 nationally in both hitting percentage (.401) and blocks per set (1.13) while placing second on his team in kills per set (2.46).Rivier holds a No. 4 seed heading into the NCAA Tournament, and will play No. 5Carthage on April 25th. This is Almario's third AVCA All-American honor, but his first on the first team. Joe Bortak, a 6-7middle blocker at Juniata College, is a junior from Jeannette, Pa. One of the most efficient hitters in the nation, Bortak heads into the NCAA Tournament ranked second in the country in hitting percentage hitting at a .434 clip. However, he doesn't let that impact what he can do on the defensive end averaging nearly one block per set. Bortak joins Almario as a three-time AVCA All-American. Brendan Chang, a 5-9 libero for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a sophomore from Laytonsville, Md. In a game full of gaudy offensive numbers, Chang has proven to be one of the best in handling what the hitters have coming his way. His3.25 digs per set places him in the top-5 in the country and first in the United Volleyball Conference. He had a big hand in keeping MIT's opponents to just a 0.151 team hitting percentage on the season. Chang has garnered AVCA First-Team All-American honors for the second consecutive year. Tim Ferriter, a 6-3 outside hitter for SUNY New Paltz, is a sophomore from Rochester, N.Y. There are few players who can beat a team in a handful of ways, but Ferriter is one of them. He ranks in the top-10 of the UVC in hitting percentage (0.365), kills per set (3.71) and service aces per set (0.32). In one day in February when the Hawks swept both then-No. 1Rivier and then-No. 2 Springfield, Ferriter combined for 27 kills, including hitting an even .500 against the Pride. Ferriter is now a two-time AVCA First-Team All-American. Nick Ferry, a 6-0 libero for Springfield College, is a senior from Valencia, Calif. The Pride has consistently been one of the top teams in the country in the last four years thanks in large part because of the play of Nick Ferry. His 2.44 digs per set places him first on the squad as he helped lead the Pride to a No. 1 seed heading into the NCAA Tournament. Ferry will also be looking for his third consecutive NCAA Championship. Ferry was named an AVCA First-Team All-American in 2011, making this his second honor. Paul Kuhn, a 6-7outside hitter for Juniata College, is a junior from York, Pa. He helped leadthe Eagles to a 2014 Continental Volleyball Conference Championship as his school will play host to the NCAA Tournament. His .411 CVC hitting percentage and 35 service aces place him third in the league. He came through in the conference semifinal against Carthage, smashing a team-high 13 kills on .455 hitting. After earning AVCA Second-Team All-American honors a year ago, this is second AA appearance. Jack McKee, a 6-6 right-side for Baruch College, is a senior from Bay Shore, N.Y. He entered the NCAA Tournament as one of the most feared attackers in the country, averaging 3.77 kills per set. That's not to say he shouldn't be taken seriously on defense. McKee is third on the Bearcats accumulating 185 digs and second with 107 blocks. For his outstanding season, he was named the 2014 CUNYAC Most Valuable Player. McKee earns AVCA All-American honors for the first time. Jimmy O'Leary, a 6-6 middle blocker for Springfield College, is a senior from Reading, Pa. There is no question that Springfield would not be in the position they're currently in if not for the play of this senior. He's currently tops in the country in hitting percentage at .501 and No.3 in blocks per set with 1.18. Springfield will play Endicott in the secondround of the NCAA Tournament, who already defeated the Gulls in straight sets on April 4th. O'Leary is now a two-time AVCA All-American after making the second team a year ago. Keaton Pieper, a 6-4 setter for Springfield College, is a junior from Dallas, Texas. Currently ranked fifth in the nation in assists per set (10.19), Pieper also contributes on the defensive end averaging0.84 digs and 0.70 blocks per set. His incredible skill set and instincts contributed to the team's 0.328 hitting percentage, which is good for the highest in the country. Pieper is afirst-time AVCA All-American. Christian Smith,a 6-5 setter for SUNY New Paltz, is a sophomore from Massapequa, N.Y. It should be no coincidence the Hawks currently rank No. 1 in the country in assists per set (12.44) and kills per set (13.42) and second in team hitting percentage (.323). Being a versatile setter, he also nailed 184kills, 33 aces, 125 digs and 59 blocks. The work of Smith helped them earn the No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, which for them will begin on April 25thon the campus of Juniata College. This is Smith's first AVCA All-American award. Chris Vaughan, a 6-4 outside hitter for the Stevens Institute of Technology, is a sophomore from Medford, N.J. In just his second year as a member of the Ducks, Vaughan has established himself as one of the best in the competitive United Volleyball Conference. His 3.52 kills per set places him seventh in the conference while his team-leading 4.04 points per set has a lot to do with his 213 digs and 67total blocks. Vaughan is now a first-time AVCA All-American. Luis Vega, a 6-0 outside hitter for Springfield College, is a sophomore from Corozal, Puerto Rico. One of the more dynamic players in 2014, Luis Vega became just the second player in Men's Division III history to record consecutive AVCA National Player of the Week honors when he did it the weeks of April 1st and April 8th.In a team with four AVCA All-Americans, Vega ranks first on the Pride averaging3.87 kills per set to accompany his .362 hitting percentage. Vega earns his first AVCA All-American honor. Michael Vellutato, a 6-1 setter for Elmira College, is a senior from Topanga, Calif. His 10.32assists per set places him in the top-5 nationally as he led his Soaring Eagles a top-15 national ranking for every week of the season, reaching as high as seventh. His 41 service aces also ranked him eighth in the United Volleyball Conference. Vellutato is now a first-time AVCA All-American. Connor Wexter, a 6-1 setter for Carthage College, is a senior from New Lenox, Ill. Just the fifth player in Division III Men'sVolleyball history to earn AVCA All-American honor four times, Wexter has led his squad to another berth to a national championship tournament.

The core of the team is reliant upon the play of their three returning all-stars among a senior class of eight. Co-captain Ryan Robida is the senior setter and a First Team ECIC III selection last year. His classmates Tyler Nosal and Jordan Teed were Second Team selections. Senior Wayne Hunzinger joins Robida as the other co-captain, while the rest of this upperclassmen group includes Joey Germann, Tyler Foster, Derek Kaczorowski and Justin Vanderwalker. Junior Mike Walizada and eighth grader Jordan Nosal round out the roster. \ufffdIt\ufffds just a good group of guys,\ufffd Robida said. \ufffdBefore anything, we have more fun than any of the other teams by far.\ufffd \ufffdWe\ufffdll be solid,\ufffd said coach Andy Murtha, who\ufffds main goal for his team this year, as always, is to have fun. Some of their other goals are \ufffdto not only beat teams, but to beat them 3-0, get the highest seed possible and not get upset in the first round.\ufffd Last fall, Maryvale was seeded fifth and was swept by No. 12 North Tonawanda in the pre-quarterfinals. It left a bad taste in the Flyers\ufffd mouth. \ufffdWe had a good season, it\ufffds just that we finished second (in the division) and we wanted to finish first...then we get into the playoffs and we didn\ufffdt do anything,\ufffd Hunzinger said. \ufffdWe sat down and let them walk all over us. It\ufffds like we didn\ufffdt belong there when we should\ufffdve just swept them.\ufffd Another goal of the Flyers was winning the division, but that may be out of reach now. They have often finished second behind Eden in ECIC III, and, like last season, their only two league losses this season have been served up by the Raiders.

Eden had a difficult opening match against 949 15 Black out of San Juan Capistrano, Calif., the fourth-ranked national team. After getting pummeled in the first set, 8-25, Eden traded points in the second set before eventually falling, 17-25. In their second match, Eden defeated NSMVC from Milwaukee, Wis. \ufffd ranked 11th nationally \ufffd 25-21, 25-18. This placed them in a great spot to come out of day one in the upper bracket, but they experienced a huge letdown against Vortex 15 Fires of Chicago, Ill., losing 25-17, 16-25, 13-15. Because of tiebreakers, NSMVC finished second in the pool, and Eden had to play a tie-breaking set against Vortex 15 Fires, with Eden winning, 25-21. Eden lost its challenge match to MB Surf Nike 15 from Manhattan Beach, Calif., 2-0, to end the first day of competition. The second day of competition presented another opportunity to face the Vortex 15 Fires. Again, Eden split and won the third set, 15-10. Williamsville native Drew Schake gave Eden a boost by providing a couple blocks at key moments. The second match of the second day of competition offered up another team from Chicago, Ill., when Eden faced Adversity 15 Purple. Despite playing well, Eden lost, 2-0.\u00a0 Eden\ufffds last match of the day was against The HBC 15 out of Huntington Beach, Calif. Eden lost 25-17, 17-25, 11-15. Again, Eden played strongly but was outmatched against strong blocking and solid defense. In the third day, Eden defeated Bounce 15 Elite from Chicago, Ill., in two sets. Their last match on the third day was against Ohana AC 15 from Orange County, Calif. Eden won the first set, 25-23. During the second set, there were some controversial in/out calls by the officials, and Eden played some of the most intense volleyball all year, losing, 27-29, but used that momentum to jump out to a 14-4 lead in the third set through strong passing and solid blocking. Eden added five aces off the serve. Jay Baumann (Lancaster) recorded seven kills, Cam Bartus (West Seneca West) had 3.5 blocks and Joe Zanelotti (Williamsville South) added 18 assists in the 15-7 win. The win set up Eden to play in Flight One on the fourth day of competition. During the semifinals of Flight One, Eden faced Ultimate 15 Gold out of Chicago, Ill. Eden won both sets 25-18 as Baumann hit .625 from the outside, Dan Berry (Canisius) added three blocks in the middle, and Brad Schneider (Lockport) consistently provided great passing, allowing Eden all options on offense. Chas Palka (Starpoint) played strong defense, digging several balls in the back court. During the championship match of Flight One, Eden faced Ultimate 15 Blue, also out of Chicago. Ultimate 15 Blue definitely had more fight, falling to Eden, 25-21, 26-24. Schneider provided eight kills. Palka passed strong, allowing Zanelotti (13 assists, six digs) and Canisius\ufffd Charlie Desmond (nine assists) to run the offense. Connor Basinski (Eden) added three kills with a .500 hitting percentage.

But the credit all goes to the players. They earned it.\ufffd St. Mary\ufffds followed that big win over St. Joe\ufffds with a hard-fought five-set home win over St. Francis eight days later. The Lancers have also posted strong showings in the Maryvale Tournament and North Tonawanda Tournament in the season\ufffds first month. The Lancers have a strong group of players leading the way, including senior hitters Wrobel, Tyler English and Marc Gonzalez, junior setter Jake Concannon and sophomore Alex Hokaj. Some younger players have also contributed big things as well for St. Mary\ufffds.\u00a0 \ufffdI think we do what we do best and not try to do something that\ufffds not us,\ufffd Wrobel said. \ufffdAnd we don\ufffdt play down to other teams\ufffd levels; we get up for every game.

West\ufffds odyssey began Sept. 18 with a 3-2 loss to Canisius. The setback stung worse than a normal loss, as the Indians dropped the fifth game by a 25-23 margin. After dropping the first two games, West stormed back and tied the match 2-2 behind better passing and attacking. In the end, coach Brett Widman noted that Canisius\ufffd defense and transition game in the middle \ufffdgave them the edge.\ufffd Senior Evan Koehler paced West offensively with 24 kills. \ufffdCanisius was a very tight match with two evenly matched teams,\ufffd Widman said. West bounced back two nights later in another 3-2 marathon, this time coming out on top against Lancaster. Consistent and aggressive serving by senior Steve Whitlow closed out game five for West, 25-20. \ufffdThis game was a preview to our ability to win close five-set matches, and about being able to make the necessary adjustments to be successful,\ufffd Widman said. \ufffdBoth teams have effective attackers at all positions, and Lancaster runs a very effective 6-2 offense, which took us a few games to adapt to.\ufffd West then knocked off then fourth-ranked Clarence on Sept. 23 in yet another barn burner, 3-2. The Indians \ufffdstruggled defensively and with passing in games two and three,\ufffd according to Widman, but came around in game four with tough serving and tightener defense. Koehler recorded 29 kills, with junior setter Ryan Kilijanski adding 50 assists. \ufffdWe showed again with our effort in this game that West has the fortitude to bounce back and win the marathon five-set matches,\ufffd Widman said. West continued its solid play two days later against then second ranked Hamburg, pulling off the 3-0 sweep. Senior middle blockers Nick Clancy and Gregg Hart took control of the net, racking up a combined 14 blocks and 15 kills, while senior libero Jake Gromlovits led the defense with 16 digs. \ufffdAfter three five-set matches in a row and some adjustments made in our blocking and defense, we played a very consistent and methodical match against Hamburg,\ufffd Widman said. \ufffdThe whole team played great as a unit; every player executed their role in a way that got Hamburg out of its comfort zone. Consistent and aggressive serving caused Hamburg to be out of sync most of the match, unable to connect with their key hitters.\ufffd \ufffdThis was our chance to prove that we were a team that could win big matches, and in the end we showed that we belonged as one of the top three teams in Western New York,\ufffd Widman added. \ufffdIt was an exhausting week having to play three five-set matches consecutively. By the time Hamburg arrived we had decided we needed to close the match more efficiently. It wasn\ufffdt going to be easy as Hamburg is a very good team, but we fought through and grew as a team.\ufffd Non-league foe St. Joe\ufffds threw a monkey wrench into the works Friday, though, shutting West out as West\ufffds \ufffdpoor defense, serving, and blocking cost us,\ufffd according to Widman. \ufffdSt. Joe\ufffds was on and we had no answers,\ufffd Widman said. West returned to action Tuesday against Frontier, but information was not available at press time for that contest. The Indians close out their week by hosting Orchard Park this evening, but then don\ufffdt play again until they host Williamsville North on Wednesday, Oct. 9. \ufffdIn order for us to stay atop the standings in the very competitive ECIC I, we will need to continue to set higher goals for ourselves, particularly concerning serve receive and defense,\ufffd Widman said. \ufffdIf we can clean up those areas, our offense will become even more efficient. Tough serving, passing and defense is what wins big matches, and we still have some work to do in those areas.\ufffd, 179549=Town of Amherst Boys volleyball players honored Amherst Bee Thursday December 25, 2013, 312958=After stumbling through an injury-plagued regular season, the Frontier boys volleyball team entered the postseason expecting to hit the road while turning things around.

Jake Gleason dished out 30 assists. But it was at the service line that Hatten made a difference, collecting four aces and leading a number of runs by the Falcons. \ufffdEric Hatten \ufffd holy cow,\ufffd Faust said. \ufffdWhat a performance tonight. Zach Gerken had a great game; I had a lot of seniors step up.\ufffd During the fourth and final game, the Redskins surged out to a 10 \ufffd 5 lead, but Frontier battled back. Even with a lead at the end, Frontier had to hold off a game Lancaster challenge \ufffd and again, Hatten delivered, when the team needed him most. Lancaster had beaten Frontier all three times the teams had faced each other, this season. Frontier moved on to the Class A final against Lockport to be played Wednesday, Nov. 6 at Hamburg. The first of two Section VI finals start 6 p.m. \ufffdEven as the last couple points of that fourth game, he did a great job,\ufffd Faust said. \ufffdI thought about calming them down, but then I said, \ufffdNo, don\ufffdt overthink it. Let Eric put them down.\ufffd And he did a great job.\ufffd \ufffdFrom day one of the playoffs, we knew we were going to have to go into other gyms,\ufffd he added. \ufffdWest Seneca West is tough; we\ufffdre going to have to bring it.\ufffd They did just that, and now Frontier is back in the final, where it will try to recapture the crown it earned in 2010 and 2011., 432402=The Western New York boys volleyball Hall of Fame has announced its 2013 class.

The bleachers and balconies were packed with rowdy students, the future inventors and leaders of our world and economy, yelling down on the Penn State servers as they tried in vain to best the Harvard serve receive led by libero Chris Gibbons. \ufffdI wasn\ufffdt surprised,\ufffd said Harvard Head Coach Brian Baise, of the eventual three-game victory. He may be the only person who wasn\ufffdt, however, considering Harvard has never, in the history of their men\ufffds volleyball team, beaten Penn State. Not only that, but Penn State hadn\ufffdt lost a conference match in almost five years, not since March 2008 when they fell to George Mason 3-1.\u00a0 \ufffdWe had a good night serving,\ufffd Baise explained. \ufffdThey\ufffdve got two real good middle blockers and because we were serving well, they couldn\ufffdt set those guys as quite as much. We thought if we could get them setting to their outside hitters from off the net, we could play defense around that.\ufffd In fact, Penn State\ufffds outside hitters Nick Goodell and Peter Russell got 20 and 23 sets respectively, with middle Aaron Russell receiving 20 as well. All of Penn State\ufffds other hitters were set less than five times each\ufffdHarvard had essentially reduced the Nittany Lions to a three-man offense. Which is not to say those three men were not totally ferocious: Aaron Russell ended the night with 11 kills hitting .400, while Peter Russell and Goodell collected 10 and eight kills, respectively.\u00a0 Harvard\ufffds offense, although fairly balanced between their five attackers, was led by sophomore outside hitter DJ White. The Hermosa Beach native had 13 kills on the night, with only 2 errors, hitting .500. \ufffd[DJ] is a player that has tremendous skill at all parts of the game, and those players are so valuable,\ufffd said Baise. \ufffdDefense, serving, receiving serve, he makes very few errors on offense and hits for a high percentage, so we look to him in a lot of ways.\ufffd\u00a0 White sustained a back injury a few weeks ago, just before Harvard played Penn State in University Park on Jan. 26. In that match, the Crimson lost 3-2, with both teams hitting below .065 and missing a combined 37 serves.\u00a0 \ufffdBacks are tricky,\ufffd said Baise. \ufffdYou really never know how long it will take, so it was touch and go.\ufffd But Baise and the Harvard team sure are glad White was back for this rematch with the Nittany Lions. \ufffdHe\ufffds very even-keel,\ufffd said Baise. \ufffdNo ups and downs, and in a match like that, it can make a difference.\ufffd White\ufffds stellar performance on Friday earned him the AVCA National Player of the Week honor, the first Harvard player to ever receive this particular recognition. He and Eric Fitterer from Lewis are the only players not from the West Coast to be named AVCA National Player of the Week so far this season.\u00a0 \ufffdI\ufffdm just glad my dad was here to watch and everyone was healthy to play,\ufffd said White. \ufffdIt was an awesome night.\ufffd White\ufffds grandfather and one of his uncles also attended Harvard, both earning MBAs. White, perhaps planning to follow in their footsteps, is an economics major. When making the decision of where to attend college, the 2011 VBM Boys\ufffd Fab 50 honoree chose Harvard with the possibility that he wouldn\ufffdt be able to play volleyball in mind.\u00a0 \ufffdAt the time I was struggling with a back injury and I thought about where I would want to be if I wasn\ufffdt playing volleyball. . . Harvard was definitely a good fit for me. I love it here.\ufffd Baise admits that recruiting for his Harvard squad can be a double-edged sword. He has to work with the tough admissions standards at the school and try to lure players to Boston away from the hotbed of men\ufffds volleyball on the West Coast.\u00a0 \ufffdOn the other hand,\ufffd he said, \ufffdI think Harvard is a very appealing place to go to school for a lot of kids. And to come here and play on a competitive volleyball team and have a good experience as part of a Division I team that is going to compete for the EIVA title, I think we can make a pretty case for it.\ufffd Student-athletes at Harvard obviously have a lot going on, not to mention tough course loads and very high expectations. But the men\ufffds volleyball team seems to have it under control. \ufffdThe student-athletes are extraordinary,\ufffd said Baise. \ufffdThey\ufffdre highly intelligent and ambitious with a great work ethic on and off the court, and they\ufffdre guys who have been successful in the things they have done in their life and like to achieve in everything they do. That makes coaching a lot easier\ufffdmotivation is not something we have to worry too much about. \ufffdYou just have to stay on top of things, but they\ufffdre pretty good at that, that\ufffds part of the reason they\ufffdre here.\ufffd The upward trajectory for this gifted bunch of athletes really began last year when the team finished the regular season second in their conference and made it to the semifinal round of the EIVA tournament. They also ranked in the AVCA poll for the first time in program history. Baise sees this year as an opportunity to do even better. \ufffdI think we\ufffdre pretty balanced,\ufffd said Baise. \ufffdProbably more so than in years past. We play all parts of the game, not trying to cover up for any glaring weak spots.\ufffd Looking forward, it\ufffds all about the Princeton/George Mason weekend for White, although Coach Baise warns not to overlook this weekend\ufffds matches versus NJIT and Rutgers-Newark, both EIVA competitions.\u00a0 \ufffdI think we\ufffdre all hoping that the Penn State win is not the highlight of our season, as great as that night was,\ufffd said Baise. \ufffdOur goal is to win our league and represent the EIVA in the final four. . . I expect we\ufffdll have to go through Penn State again [to do that].\ufffd White is optimistic as well. \ufffdLast year we were kind of down on injuries, but some guys really stepped up. This year guys don\ufffdt really have to step up, we just have to play really solid and we\ufffdll be really good, and that\ufffds what we\ufffdre doing right now.\ufffd Who knows what will happen as the season progresses.

The Lions earned a little redemption by defeating Clarence in straight sets, 25-19, 29-27 and 25-11, at Lockport High School. As a result, they\ufffdll play in the Class A final on Wednesday, Nov. 6 and take on No. 5 Frontier, which upset top-ranked West Seneca West later in the day. \ufffdWe knew coming in that we were a good team and that [Clarence] would have to fight,\ufffd outside hitter Brad Schneider said. \ufffdAnd we played our best.\ufffd Lockport coach Joe Whalen and his club drew up a stiff game plan to thwart the effectiveness of Clarence\ufffds tipping game, which is a staple of the Red Devils\ufffd attack.\u00a0 \ufffdAll we worked on in practice was tip defense, tip offense and just finding ways around the blocks,\ufffd Lockport\ufffds 6-foot-8 middle Jason Donorovich said. \ufffdIt obviously worked out very well for us today.\ufffd \ufffdWe knew that they were going to be tipping a lot and that they feed the outside,\ufffd Schneider added. \ufffdThey only set the middle three times today. On the outsides, we made sure to cover the tips.\ufffd In limiting the Clarence attack, Whalen said the Lions were able to run their offense for much of the match, a feat they couldn\ufffdt accomplish in the teams\ufffd first meeting back on Aug. 31. \ufffdI thought we ran our offense off those inside circles,\ufffd Whalen said. \ufffdIt was a great game. Everything that they have been working on I thought they did a job.\ufffd After taking the opening set, the Lions engaged in a thriller of a second with the Red Devils, which may have been the turning point of the match. Leading 6-3, they gave up eight unanswered points and were victims of an 11-1 run by Clarence, which had built a 14-7 lead. But Lockport wasn\ufffdt ready to lay down. The team rallied back, ripping off a 6-1 run to cut the deficit to 15-13. Later, trailing 21-17, the Lions chipped away at the Clarence advantage and went on a 7-2 tear to take the lead \ufffd their first since claiming the set\ufffds first two points \ufffd 24-23.\u00a0 Like Lockport, however, Clarence wasn\ufffdt finished. The Red Devils surged back and eventually took a 26-25 lead. They seemed poised to win, but a volatile Lions\ufffd squad continued to fight, eventually escaping with a 29-27 victory. Setter Jack Whalen, Joe\ufffds son, spoke highly of his squad\ufffds resiliency.\u00a0 \ufffdThat shows everything that our team is trying to be,\ufffd he said of the Lions, who coasted to a 25-11 win in the third and final set. \ufffdOur team is never out of it. It shows when we\ufffdre playing one of the better teams in Western New York, and we beat them in three games.\ufffd For the Red Devils, head coach Kevin Starr said it came down to running into a bigger, faster team in Lockport. They couldn\ufffdt execute as well as they would have liked because of it. \ufffdWe changed our defense to handle what they were doing and I thought we did that pretty well, especially in the first two games, but they just executed better than we did,\ufffd he said. Clarence\ufffds season came to an end, but Starr said he was proud of what the Red Devils accomplished. They finished 6-6 in ECIC I play and defeated Orchard Park in the sectional quarterfinals. Additionally, they won their own tournament for the very first time. \ufffdWe played very well all year long,\ufffd Starr said. \ufffdWe just lost to a great team. I think on another day we could have beat them. Overall I\ufffdm proud of the boys.\ufffd Prior to knowing who his club would square off against in the final, Joe Whalen noted that there is a preconceived notion of a discrepancy in the competitiveness of northtowns\ufffd versus southtowns\ufffd schools. \ufffdThere is a misconception that if you\ufffdre a northtowns\ufffd school you won\ufffdt be at the same level as the southtowns,\ufffd he said. \ufffdWell, half a zone of my boys have been playing with all the southtown kids since they were in eighth grade. There is no difference in level.\ufffd Whalen put that theory to the test when the Lions took on the Falcons Wednesday, Nov. 6 at Hamburg.

When they make those decisions, we play better.\ufffd The Panthers are led by senior captains Taylor Sutherland (6-foot-5 middle hitter), Ben Miller (left side/outside hitter) and Corey Allen (setter). Sutherland, a returning ECIC II Second Team All-Star, can do it all, said Cicero. \ufffdHe can hit, set and has a great jump serve,\ufffd Cicero said. \ufffdHe can do a lot of things well.\ufffd Cicero said Allen, a returning starter, is making good decisions with his passing and bringing up the level of play. Also returning is senior James Nix, an athletic 6-5 middle hitter. The rest of the starting lineup is juniors Connor Heald (left side hitter) and Mike Belluz (libero). Juniors Justin Okun and Mitchell Meza are battling for the starting spot at right side hitter.

Replacing that elite lineup wasn\ufffdt easy, but the 10th-seeded Eagles found themselves with a chance to reach the semifinals of the Class B playoffs, when they matched up with the second-seeded Raiders of Eden on Oct. 31. That is where the season would end for a young Lake Shore squad that made strides, this season. Meanwhile, the Raiders fell to Williamsville South in the semifinals, two days later. Eagles head coach John Coyle, in his 19th season, had a challenging task when the season started, as he worked with players that had little to no experience on a varsity team. \ufffdIt was a lot of a feeling-out process,\ufffd said Coyle. \ufffdIt was a lot of \ufffdwho\ufffds going to work here, who\ufffds going to work there, what\ufffds going to work with this rotation?\ufffd We switched our rotation around a half-dozen more times than I wanted to, early in the year.\ufffd This year\ufffds team returned just one player, libero Brad Owens, the only senior in the starting lineup.
