Taken from Harned and Owen, 1958.[3] the figure that follows shows the dependence of pKw on a wider range of temperature. (Since the equilibrium law is not obeyed exactly, even in dilute solutions, results of most equilibrium calculations are rounded to three significant figures.

    "textAfterTable": "Ionic strength affects ionization of water, Kw reaches a maximum of 2 x 10\u201314 mol2 l\u20132 at about 0.25 M ionic strength (trimethylammonium chloride) and decreases to 1 x 10\u201314 mol2 l\u20132 when the ionic strength is raised to 5 M.[1] Kw tends to increase in the presence of organic compounds.[2] Even though the degree of ionization is small (2.8 x 10\u20139 at 37oC), the dissociation of water has important implications in all biological systems including foods. Besides acting as lubricant, cleaning fluid, transporting media (nutrients and waste products) in living systems. The auto-ionization ability of water makes it a highly effective medium for proton exchange and participate essentially in four types of reactions: oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and condensation.[2] The following sections in this chapter will show the importance of ionization of water as the major component and solvent in food systems. The equilibrium constant Kw applies not only to pure water but to any aqueous solution at 25\u00b0C. Thus, for example, if we add 1.00 mol of the strong acid HNO3, used in methods to determine ash content in foods, to H2O to make a total volume of 1 dm3, essentially all the HNO3 molecules donate their protons to H2O: and a solution in which",
