            "We have our own police department. They not only protect students but you can sign up for classes so you can learn to protect yourself. The ROTC boys escort anyone who doesnt want to walk alone in the dark for safety reasons. We have excellent dorm security, everyone who enters has to swipe in or sign in at the front desk.",
            "I am not well informed in this area but we have many frats and sororities.",
            "Endless options. If you dont like any clubs on campus you can form your own.",
            "This is a good school for anyone who likes big campus University's. So many differant types of people come here so I can specifically describe what type of students would have a great time here.",
            "During exam week, I know a lot of people rub the Patterson statue's foot for luck. I do it before every math exam.",
            "Out of state tuition is outragous but I pay it because this is a great University.",
            "There is so much to do for fun! Theres greek life, community service, and differant churches you can get involved with. The Student Activities board is always planning events and holding concerts. You can watch free movies at Worsham Theatre every week. If you are board, there is something on campus that will occupy your time.",
            "There are a lot of choices and all of the food I have eaten on campus is excellent. I wish more restaurants were open later because Ovid's is the only restaurant open at night. Its a bit of an inconvienence to walk all the way to the library to eat, but it's worth it.",
            "My dorm and most of the other dorms on campus are old and have problems. The parking is very far away which is a hassle and the internet is spotty at best. I am glad new dorms are being built so some of the worse dorms currently in use can be ripped down.",
            "This is college, not high school. Classes are hard and take a lot of effort. I need to study at least three times a week. A lot of classes dont have too much homework so you think you can get by just doing that and studing for tests, but exams like to sneak up on you and if you arent prepared your grades will suffer.",
            "Visit campus, talk to students, and just get a feel for UK before you decide to come here. A big University isnt for everyone.",
            "The University of Kentucky is amazing! I love it here because campus is gorgeous and teachers and teacher assistants do everything they can to provide a high quality education. The only problems I have encountered with this school is the lack of parking for students and poor internet service in the dormitorys."

I went from getting kicked out to returning three years later and accomplished a 3.25 GPA for the semester., 356203=This campus is gorgeous, there are safety measures everywhere, and everyone is incredibly helpful. I have yet to see someone who wouldn't point me in the right direction (or give me a completely random high-five when she realized we had the same major). I wish it was August already, and move-in day., 786307=Tour the campus in October - you'll see how big and beautiful the campus truly is before it's a little too chilly. Don't count UK out if you are from Lexington or a surrounding area: it can easily be your new home [somewhat] away from home!, 465115=Apply for scholarships and housing as soon as you can. The sooner you get this done the better chance you have of getting a good dorm or more scholarship money. Also apply for financial aid on Jan. 1., 513366=K Week introductory activities are awesome and a good way to get to know the campus, but don't get used to having fun and partying all the time. By September, you'll have to crack down on studying!, 355569=-Talk to everyone. That's why they're there. Financial aid counselor, admissions counselor, or just call. -Apply early. I had my application in as soon as I could (October) and got the decision letter in November. -GPA is important, so don't slack off, but practice your testing skills for the ACT or SAT. My GPA was 2.98, but I got accepted with an ACT score of 32. -Visit the campus anytime you get the chance. It's beautiful. And bring an umbrella!, 299375=The greek life is great they help with community service events the NPHC holds a Martin Luther King march every year which is fun. Also some of the Greeks in the NPHC have Yard shows, Step shows during homecoming and other fun events., 854033=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2528=When President Todd accepted the role as University President, he brought with him the Top 20 business plan meaning, thus, that the university will be a in the top 20 by the year 2020. Therefore, the University of Kentucky is making progress to become on of the top 20 schools in the nation. The William T. Young Library, a 58 million dollar complex, has the nation's second largest book endowment second only to Harvard University and is the largest among Public Universities. Also, on a side note the fifth floor was voted the best place on campus to get a date., 348057=Willy T which is the library is always filled during exam week and its almost a social event as well as a study event. Also during March Madness the city of lexington gets out of control and thats something that everyone should experience.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Even though UK is a pretty big school, they make it more like a small school by keeping many classes with a low student to teacher ratio, so you receive more one on one time with your instructor, which makes it easier to grasp the bigger concepts and master the small ones.

UK is VERY diverse and offers opportunity for any kind of student. Tips for prospective students Definitely live on campus for at LEAST one year. It's awesome! Apply early for housing though... or you wont get your assignment until late summer and you definitely wont get the dorm you want. GET INVOLVED! There are so many opportunities to do this, don't worry. Take advantage of resources like The Study",
