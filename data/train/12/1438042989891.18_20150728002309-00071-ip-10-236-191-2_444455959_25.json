            "Description",
            "Tampon Having An Improved Finger Pocket - A tampon having an improved finger pocket. The finger pocket can have a width that can be calculated by the equation D",
            "WRAPPER HAVING A CORD RESERVOIR - Wrappers having cord reservoirs are provided. A feminine device having an insertion end, a withdrawal end, and a withdrawal member, the withdrawal member having a proximal end nearest the withdrawal end of the feminine device and a distal end disposed opposite the proximal end is provided. The feminine device can be at least partially enclosed by a wrapper. The wrapper can have a first end disposed adjacent to the insertion end, a second end opposite the insertion end, and a longitudinal axis. In certain embodiments, the wrapper can have a cord reservoir at the second end of the wrapper, the cord reservoir being adapted to contain at least a portion of the withdrawal member within the cord reservoir. In addition, the cord reservoir can have a length measured along the longitudinal axis from the distal end of the feminine device to the second end of the wrapper of at least about 1 mm.",
            "METHOD FOR MOVING ARTICLES AND CONTROLLING THE POSITION OF SAME - Methods for moving and controlling the position of an article are described. In one embodiment, the method employs a conveyor including a substantially planar surface and a support member situated opposite the substantially planar surface. An article is placed between and in contact with both the substantially planar surface and the support member. And at least one of the conveyor and the support member are moved wherein the article is both rotated and translated so that the rotation amount substantially matches the translation amount.",
            "Systems and Methods for Modeling Compliant Parts - Included are systems and methods for modeling compliant parts. Some of the systems and/or methods include creating a 3-dimensional simulation of a product that includes an outer part and an inner part, determining a deformation characteristic of the product, and simulating an interaction of the inner part with the outer part. Similarly, in some of the systems and/or methods a characteristic of interaction may be measured from the interaction, a determination may be made regarding whether the characteristic of interaction meets a predetermined threshold. In some of the systems and/or methods, in response to determining that the characteristic of interaction meets the predetermined threshold, an output may be sent indicating product design acceptability. In response to determining that the characteristic of interaction does not meet the predetermined threshold, the 3-dimensional simulation may be iteratively altered until the characteristic of interaction meets the predetermined threshold.",
            "PACKAGE COMPRISING PEELABLE OVERLABEL - Packages for containing consumer goods are disclosed. The consumer goods may be disposable, durable or semi-durable. Absorbent article is one class of disposable articles that may be contained by packages. The packages comprise an opening that is covered by an overlabel. The overlabel is at least partially peeled off of the package so that articles contained within the package can be removed through the now exposed opening. In some embodiments, the package can be reclosed by covering the opening with the overlabel. A consumer may wish to dispose of a used article by placing the article back into the package via the opening and re-adhering the overlabel.",
            "METHOD FOR MOVING ARTICLES AND CONTROLLING THE POSITION OF SAME - Heat and/or mechanical treatments on a post-molded article to create designs or textures that extend minimally above or below a surface of the article are described."

Some embodiments of the systems and/or methods may retrieve an electronic document from a source, determine whether the electronic document is associated with a predetermined first matter, and in response to determining that the electronic document is associated with the predetermined first matter, link the electronic document to the predetermined first matter. Similarly, in some embodiments, the systems and methods may further create a second matter and may link the electronic document to the second matter, such that accessing the electronic document can provide other documents linked to the second matter, receive a request for the electronic document, and in response to receiving the request for the electronic document, provide a user option to provide access to the other documents linked to the predetermined first matter. 20120011427 Published Description Patent application number Mark David Wasson, Seattle, WA US 08-05-2010 SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR EXTRACTING INFORMATION FROM TEXT USING TEXT ANNOTATION AND FACT EXTRACTION - A fact extraction tool set (\u201cFEX\u201d) finds and extracts targeted pieces of information from text using linguistic and pattern matching technologies, and in particular, text annotation and fact extraction. Text annotation tools break a text, such as a document, into its base tokens and annotate those tokens or patterns of tokens with",
