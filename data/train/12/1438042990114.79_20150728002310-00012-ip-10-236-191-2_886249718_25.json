            "Very helpful, and unobtrusive.",
            "There are many school and student run clubs and organizations which students can join. It's well worth your time to find an activity on campus, weather it be anything from the church choir, to the chess club.",
            "Good for a wide variety of students. While not a party school, there are parties near by which the more party oriented students can attend. Many great quiet places near by for those who prefer spending time in coffee shops and studying.",
            "Not technically on campus, but make sure to check out Pizza Milano (or as everyone on campus calls it, Milanos). $10 for a large pizza and large drink of your choice with the college special. By far the most popular location for Duquesne students.",
            "It's a private university, so it can be a bit expensive. However, the academics and excellent location more than make up for it. They offer fairy good financial aid if you push for it.",
            "Explore the city! Pittsburgh has a plethora of old and new shops, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and just about anything else you could think of. You would be hard pressed to not find something interesting to do in this city. In addition to all the great off campus options,",
            "The main dining hall is decent, but not exactly high quality dining. The other dining options on campus typically provide a much better eating experience, but sometimes cost a bit more than a meal swipe.",
            "The sign in system is a pain, but overall the dorms are very nice. Make sure to fill out the dorm questionnaire to ensure you get the type of dorm you want! The dorms range from quite, to loud. The suite dorms are very nice if you can get one.",
            "Very professional, and classes will be tough. However, you get a lot out of them, and almost all the professors show a great concern for the students actually learning the material, rather than just forcing them through it.",
            "Be smart, study hard, and treat it like a serious college. It's not a party school, so it's wise to take the time to really study the material, particularly for the sciences. Make sure to check out all the great resources at the school, and attend some of the events hosted during the year. During time off from class, get out and explore the city, as there are many great places to visit. Make SURE to attend orientation, no matter how lame you think it will be. It's a ton of fun, and they go all out to ensure new students feel welcomed.",
            "A wonderful college, with a beautiful, almost park-like campus, which is tucked away in the heart of Pittsburgh. Spiritual growth is greatly encouraged right along side academic growth, and there's a great community atmosphere. Being located on the bluff, there is never a shortage of things to do during down time, as well as many great study areas scattered near by around the city."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Duquesne University is a very prestigious school that has an entire melting pot of students. You will find an interesting mix of people from all different races, religions, and ethnicities. Also, teachers are absolutely great. I am going to be a sophomore and I must say that the teachers I met in my freshman year were exceptional. I am a psychology major and I feel like I had a great relationship with my psych teachers. One teacher offered me advice and told me that I could use her as a reference anytime. I feel that the professors at Duquesne actually care about their students and are not solely there for a paycheck.
