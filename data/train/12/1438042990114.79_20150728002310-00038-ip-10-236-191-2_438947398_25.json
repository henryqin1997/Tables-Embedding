            "Description",
            "MOBILE TERMINAL - Disclosed is a mobile terminal including a ring section having a plurality of operation devices provided on a substantially circular enclosure, a terminal body section having at least a display device,a pair of hinge sections which have a rotation axis substantially parallel to a tangent line of a ring circumference direction of the ring section and rotatably journal the terminal body section at a rotation angle of at least 90 degrees with respect to the ring section, and a body-ring interface section which performs at least signal transmission between the ring section and the terminal body section.",
            "METHOD OF SECURING HINGE, AND ELECTRONIC APPARATUS - An electronic apparatus including: a first case; a second case having an inclined arm fitting part; a hinge enabling the first and second cases to rotate around a first rotational axis; a secured piece secured to the hinge and the second case, the secured piece having an inclined arm part that fits into the inclined arm fitting part; and an inclined arm securing member configured to secure the inclined arm part fit to the inclined arm fitting part by insertion into a pair of gaps provided between the inclined arm fitting part and the inclined arm part.",
            "PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANT, AND DISPLAY CONTROL METHOD AND DISPLAY CONTROL PROGRAM THEREOF - An information processing device including a plurality of rectangular-shaped casings each including a first principal surface, and a second principal surface opposing the first principal surface and including a display panel having a predetermined aspect ratio. The information processing device including a connecting portion connecting each of the plurality of rectangular-shaped casings in a closed state in which each of the plurality of rectangular-shaped casings are mutually overlaid and a display panel of at least one of the plurality of rectangular-shaped casings is externally exposed, and in an open state in which wall portions of mutually adjacent rectangular-shaped casings abut and the display panels of each of the plurality of rectangular-shaped casings face a similar direction. The information processing device further includes a terminal state detecting unit that detects the closed state and the opened state, and a display control unit that controls display of each of the display panels.",
            "TERMINAL APPARATUS AND HINGE STRUCTURE - A terminal apparatus that includes a first housing, a second housing, and a hinge mechanism that slidably couples the first housing to the second housing in each of an open state and a closed state with respect to the second housing. The hinge mechanism includes a base portion and a movable portion, the movable portion being slidable with respect to the base portion in a direction which the first housing moves away from the second housing when the first housing transitions from the closed state to the open state with respect to the second housing."
