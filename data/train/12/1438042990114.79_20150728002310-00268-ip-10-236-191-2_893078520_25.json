They have made this whole process very easy., 355463=Have not yet began. I will begin on April 29th., 490375=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 207464=I have been enrolled at Saint Leo (Adult Center, Georgia) since March 2012 and can't express how much I've appreciated the professionalism of the instructors. As a non-traditional student I was apprehensive about returning to school. I haven't regretted my decision!, 89042=campus was founded in 1889., 149561=Staff has been very helpful in transitioning from my community college. Financial aid representative is easy to work with and informative. Look forward to starting my first semester Fall 2012., 147549=I will be attending Saint Leo in the fall of 2012 as a freshman., 412024=As a commuter, a meal plan is not required. That being said, I have gone into the main dining area a few times. The food is great; it is buffet style. The only draw back for commuters and the main dining area is the price, $10 as of 2013. The Lion's Lair is more reasonable on price but it is not a buffet and there are limited options. However, it offers grilled items, deli items, snacks, drinks, and items needed for your dorm if you live on campus.}",
