            "FAIRING AND AIRFOIL APPARATUS AND METHOD - An airfoil for use on a high speed, jet powered airborne mobile platform and secured to an exterior surface of said mobile platform at a location so as to be disposed within a boundary layer during flight of the mobile platform. The airfoil produces a peak Mach number for airflow over a longitudinal centerline of said airfoil that is no greater than about Mach 1.2 when said mobile platform is moving at a speed of about Mach 0.85 with a relative constant Mach number flow over a region defined as at least an approximate 20% length of maximum thickness of said airfoil. The airfoil also has a pressure distribution (Cp) that is positive at a trailing edge thereof.",
            "ANTENNA FAIRING AND METHOD - A fairing suitable for enclosing a component mounted on an exterior surface of a mobile platform, and more particularly on an outer surface of a high speed mobile platform such as a jet aircraft or an aerospace vehicle. The fairing provides aggressive closure angles for optimum RF performance when used to house an antenna that is scanned to varying azimuth and elevation angles. The fairing further provides low aerodynamic drag, is scalable to enclose components having wide ranging dimensions, and provides attached flow with minimum separation of airflow thereover for airflows experienced by high speed jet aircraft, and reduces or eliminates RF reflections within the fairing from the RF beam of the antenna."

Ferguson, Renton, WA US 11-29-2012 CROSS-PLATFORM DATA PRESERVATION - Embodiments are directed to determining in an email data store which of a plurality of email mailboxes is searchable, to searching multiple mailboxes in an email data store and to preserving data items that are placed on hold. In an embodiment, a web service receives a request to determine which among many different email mailboxes is available for searching. The web service allows multiple different programs to search the email data store. The web service sends a query to the email data store to determine which email mailboxes are available for searching. The web service also returns a list of those email mailboxes which are searchable in the data store. The searchable mailboxes have an appropriate, specified version and permissions indicating that the mailbox is searchable. 20120303653 Published Description Patent application number Sean W. Ferguson, Renton, WA US 12-13-2012 QUERY-BASED INFORMATION HOLD - Systems and methods for implementing a query-based hold on electronic items hosted by a communication device and/or system. Electronic items from a plurality of user-specific folders are purged and copied to a discovery hold folder. The purged items, along with all existing items, contained within the discovery hold folder are evaluated against the query-based hold criteria. Items that fail to meet the query-based hold criteria are permanently deleted from the discovery hold folder. Items that meet the query-based hold criteria are",
