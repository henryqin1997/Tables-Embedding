In some cases, however, to pass an element such as this element, which does have a null value, you must state this explicitly (for example, <X xsi:nil=\"true\"/>). The namespace, xsi, used for the nillable attribute, must be declared explicitly in the instance XML (for example, xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\")., 190771=Choose this operation to employ the sequencing table: last updated strategy. This polling strategy involves using a helper table to remember a last_updated value. A last_updated value of 2005-01-01 12:45:01 000, for example, means that every record last updated at that time or earlier have been processed. Because many tables have rows with a last_updated or creation_time column maintained by triggers or the application, this strategy can often be used for noninvasive polling.

This polling strategy involves using a helper table to remember a sequence value. The source table is not modified; instead, rows that have been read in a separate helper table are recorded. A sequence value of 1000, for example, means that every record with a sequence less than that value have been processed. Because many tables have some counter field that is always increasing and maintained by triggers or the application, this strategy can often be used for noninvasive polling.

Alias data types are created by using the sp_addtype database engine stored procedure or the CREATE TYPE Transact-SQL statement (only for SQL Server 2005.)

The Adapter Configuration Wizard then introspects the returned row set and generates a strongly typed XSD. You can enter arguments easily through the wizard.

The XML values for these data types must adhere to the XML schema representation for dateTime. Therefore, a simple DATE string, 01-JAN-05, is invalid. XML schema defines dateTime as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss. Therefore, the correct DATE value is 2005-01-01T00:00:00.

JPublisher is used to create a corresponding OBJECT type whose attributes match the fields of the RECORD, and conversion APIs that convert from RECORD to OBJECT and vice versa. JPublisher also generates a wrapper procedure (or function) that accepts the OBJECT and invokes the underlying method using the conversion APIs in both directions. The invoked methods must be installed in an Oracle database (not Oracle Lite).",
