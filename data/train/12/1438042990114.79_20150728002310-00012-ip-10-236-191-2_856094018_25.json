Seven groups were drawn in total: Four of five teams and three groups of four contested the European qualifying competition. As a result, the seven group-winners qualified, while the runners-up in the groups containing five teams also qualified directly.

The weakest runner-up missed out (Denmark)., 100099=The 1989 CONCACAF Championship also served as the qualifying process for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The Championship consisted of a two-round qualification process, with the ten lowest-ranked CONCACAF teams beginning in the first round. The five teams successfully winning their two-legged ties were joined by the five highest ranked CONCACAF teams in the second round, which again consisted of teams being drawn into two-legged ties. The five victorious teams contested the final tournament of the 1989 Championship, which took the form of a group with teams playing each other on a home-and-away basis. The eventual CONCACAF champions and runners-up qualified for the World Cup finals., 122736=There was one inter-confederation play-off to determine the final qualification spot for the 1990 FIFA World Cup finals.

Mexico were disqualified from the CONCACAF qualifying tournament before playing a game for fielding overage players in the qualifying stages for the 1988 Olympic Games.

Therefore the total number of teams playing at least one fixture during the 1990 World Cup competition was 105 (103 during qualifying)., 2458=The first qualification match was played on 17 April 1988 and qualification concluded on 19 November 1989.
