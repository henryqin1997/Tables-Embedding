    "textAfterTable": "Kyle Wiltjer Key stats: 12.0 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 43.4 3FG pct. Wiltjer was supposed to take on a more important, expanded role coming into this season. On one account of that, he's been successful. He's more than doubled his minutes played and how many shots he's taking. Last year, as the clear-cut seventh man, he took 7.2 percent of his team's total shots. This year, he's taken 15.7 percent of the team's shots. But he hasn't expanded his offensive game at all. In fact, he's only become more one-dimensional. In his freshman year, exactly 50 percent of his shots were 3-pointers; this season, 62.8 percent of his shots come from behind the arc. His accuracy is virtually unchanged - he's shooting 0.2 percent better so far this year. Wiltjer talked about improving his game by going inside more, but so far, he's only lived more on the perimeter. Alex Poythress Key stats: 14.0 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 64.2 FG pct. Poythress",
