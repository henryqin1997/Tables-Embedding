You might also do research and evaluate living things in an area, from plants to animals, from the sky above to the ground below. You can also work with a government agency such as the National Parks Service, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, or the Environmental Protection Agency. One career path is to work with an organization dealing with conservation issues, particularly in the nonprofit sector. Depending on your interests, you can choose one that deals with one specific issue or multiple. Larger organizations usually have a bigger net to throw, so if you\u2019re not sure about one specific path within conservation, a large organization gives you more options. Politically inclined? Lots of conservation",
