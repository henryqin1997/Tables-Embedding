Usually i hear colleges have huge classes and also say that because of the the amount of students in a class, teachers cant help everyone when needed, but here in ITT Technical, the classes are small and the teachers are willing to help with any question needed. Importantly ITT Technical Institute has been a great help with my financial stuff by making sure that i'm at the right track from any financial problem., 991959=The location is 1905 S. Haggerty Road, Canton, MI 48185. It's not unusual, it's a quiet, pleasant, safe area, and very easy to find (across from 275 bridge near a CVS store), 320162=I think this is a great college for me to attend, to further my education. When I went and toured the campus is really liked how they work mostly hands on. I am really excited about attending this college in August., 684578=Students are allowed to correspond and perform orientation ceremonies for prospective students who are still in high school. For instance, I was the Student Ambassador for the School of Criminal Justice at the Mobile, AL campus from 2008 to 2010., 806703=You get out of it what you put into it. Study and be prepared for the assignments, and it will pay off. Answer questions properly and be meticulous in grammar and formatting. Do quality research online and in the library (ours is virtual)., 670799=I have not yet attended the school, because I start on the 12th of December. However during my enrollment and orientation I felt very welcomed and supported with the staff., 452513=Really cant rate this fairly considering I have do not start classes until september., 388974=Our campus is very safe, we've never had a problem there since i'v ebeen a student as of May 2011 and i've never heard nor seen anything happen. Where my campus is the police department is too far around the corner so they're constantly passing by. And on occasions they come by to talk to the students majoring in criminal justice., 146651=have not started yet i start on the 12th of march 2012, 153830=i have currently enrolled to and will begin attending itt technical institute on 03/19/2012. so far from what i have seen as far as a tour of the campus i believe this college will definitely offer me with the resources necessary to achieve my future goal. i am looking forward to attending this nationally recognized institute this spring., 735328=I have attended this campus since September 2011, there has never been a safety issue that I am aware of, however there are many veterans and faculty that attend this campus.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here For the year in an half I have been here I enjoy coming to school. At times it is hard to stay motivated to show up to class but that is for ever college student. In some of the classes you will come across someone already in the field that you can talk with to get some insight. Am learning a lot I am learning many tasks that I would use in the field quickly in the degree I am attending ITT-Tech for. There are breaks in between quarters which helps me obtain the knowledge I have received. A lot of work is given, but group work is highly recommended to lessen the work load.
