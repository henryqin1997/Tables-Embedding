The Sixth Machine Gun Battalion was similarly cited for its work in the Chateau-Thierry sector and Aisne-Marne (Soissons) offensive. The Fourth Brigade received a similar citation for its work in the Chateau-Thierry sector. Since two French Army citations are sufficient to make an organization eligible for the award of the French fourrag\u00e9re, the high standard of the Marine units is evident. Information was received in January, 1920, that the War Department had accepted the award of the French fourrag\u00e9re in the colors of the ribbon of the Croix de Guerre for several Army organizations and the three units of the Fourth Brigade., 341833=This depot was established soon after the declaration of war for the purpose of supplying all posts south of Norfolk, including the West Indies. The storage facilities consist of 7 warehouses and a total floor space of 124,778 square feet. A total of about 14,287 tons of stores were shipped from this depot during the fiscal year 1919, these stores being valued at approximately $12,000,000; during the same period approximately 18,000 tons of stores were received, at an estimated value of $15,000,000. Practically all shipments of supplies of every description for troops in the West Indies are made from this depot., 85608=At the beginning of the war the course of recruit instruction at the recruit depot, Parris Island, was of 8 weeks duration, and with but very few exceptions every recruit passing through this depot received 8 weeks instruction. At the Mare Island recruit depot, the recruits received 12 weeks training from April 6 to 28, 1917, 9 weeks from April 29, 1917, to June 21, 1918, and 8 weeks from June 22 to November 11, 1918., 251909=In March, 1918, the Marine flying field, Miami, Fla., was established and on March 31, 1918, the First Aviation Squadron was transferred to that field from Lake Charles, La., 113352=Maj. Edward B. Cole was in command of the Sixth Machine Gun Battalion of Marines from the date of its organization until June 10, 1918, when he received a mortal wound., 186934=The following citation in Fifth Army Corps General Orders No. 26, dated November 20, 1918, gives a further description of these operations:, 171214=On September 28, 1918, the Fourth Brigade moved by bus and marching to the Souain-Suippes area, with brigade headquarters at Suippes., 249669=On April 6, 1917, the Marine section of naval aviation consisting of five officers and 30 enlisted men, was stationed at the naval air station, Pensacola, Fla., as part of the complement of that station., 259214=The number of planes operated by Marine aviators at Pensacola, Fla., on April 6, 1917, was four, and the type, AH Curtiss., 176761=The Second Infantry Division, United States, brilliantly commanded by Gen. Lejeune * * * played a glorious part in the operations of the Fourth Army in the Champagne in October, 1918. On the 3d of October this division drove forward and seized in a single assault the strongly entrenched German positions between Blanc Mont and Medeah Ferme, and again pressing forward to the outskirts of Saint Etienne-a-Arnes it made in the course of the day an advance of about 6 kilometers., 113852=On September 23, 1917, the First Battalion of the Sixth Regiment sailed on the Henderson from New York and landed at St. Nazaire, France, on October 5, 1917. On October 17, 1917, the Seventy-third Machine Gun Company, Headquarters, and Supply Companies, and Col. Albertus W. Catlin, commanding officer of the Sixth Regiment, with his Staff, sailed from Philadelphia, Pa., on the De Kalb, and from New York on October 18, 1917, arriving at St. Nazaire, France, on November 1, 1917. On October 31 1917, the Third Battalion of the Sixth Regiment sailed from New York on board the VON STEUBEN and anchored at Brest, France, on November 1 2,1917. On January 24, 1918, the Second Battalion of the Sixth Regiment sailed on the Henderson from New York and arrived at St. Nazaire, France, February 6, 1918, and with the arrival of this last battalion, the entire Sixth Regiment of Marines was in France., 268799=The following table shows strength of Marine Corps Reserve on active duty on November 11, 1918:, 291722=NAVY DEPARTMENT, August 13, 1919., 133768=Active operations were conducted in Haiti and Santo Doiningo against bandits during the period of the war by Marine forces, the Haitian Gendarmerie and the Guardia Nacional Dominicana, the two latter organizations being composed of natives and administered and officered by the Marine and Navy personnel. Casualties were suffered by Marines in the operations in Santo Domingo, 4 Marines being killed, 13 wounded, and 1 officer wounded, between April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918., 141541=Then late in May, 1918, with startling success, which brought a corresponding depression to the morale of the Allies, the Germans launched their third offensive, west of Rheims, crossed the Chemin-des-Dames, captured Soissons, and the last day of May found them marching in the direction of Paris down the Marne Valley. Again the American commander in chief placed every available man at the disposal of Marshal Foch. It was at this critical time, when the Allies were facing a grave crisis, that the Second Division, including the Marine Brigade, together with elements of the Third and Twenty-eighth Divisions, were thrown into the line and, in blocking the German advance in the Chateau-Thierry sector, rendered great assistance in stopping the most dangerous of the German drives., 137623=The Fourth Brigade remained in the Bourmont training area, with headquarters at Damblain, until March 14, 1918, when it commenced movement into subsectors of the Verdun front, the first units of the brigade entering the front line during the night of March 16-17, 1918, with headquarters at Toulon. On April 1, 1918, brigade headquarters was changed to Moscou. The brigade remained on the Verdun front until May 14, 1918, when it proceeded to an area around Vitry-le-Francois for open warfare training, with headquarters at Venault-les-Dames. In the meantime, on May 6, 1918, Brig. Gen. James G. Harbord assumed command of the brigade relieving Big. Gen. Doyen who has been ordered to the United States on account of his physical condition. Brig. Gen. Doven relinquished command of the brigade most unwillingly, and the reasons for his relief are best set forth in the words of the citation of a Navy distinguished service medal posthumously awarded to him, reading as follows., 167976=On August 7, 1918, information was received of the promotion of Bri. Gen. Lejeune to the grade of major general, and of Col. Neville to the grade of brigadier general, both to date from July 1, 1918., 148672=VI\u00b0 ARMEE, ETAT-MAJOR, au Q. G. A., le 30 Juin, 1918., 118610=On January 21, 1918, the First Marine Aeronautic Company arrived at naval base No. 13, Ponta Delgada, Azores., 75290=The officers appointed from civil life, as soon as enrolled, were ordered to the Marine barracks, Mare Island, Calif.; San Diego, Calif.; Parris Island, S.C.; and the Marine Corps rifle range, Winthrop, Md., for instruction, pending the completion of the buildings for their use at the Marine barracks, Quantico, Va. Early in July, 1917, the buildings being in readiness, the newly appointed officers, about 345 in number, were assembled at Quantico, where an officers' camp of instruction was held, and the course completed in October, 1917., 140291=In order to appreciate understandingly the importance of the early operations participated in by the Marine Brigade as a unit of the Second Division it is necessary to remember that in 1918, prior to the middle of July, the offensive was in the hands of the Imperial German Staff, and that between March 21, 1918, and July 15, 1918, the Germans directed no less than five major offensives against the Allied lines in efforts to bring the war to a successful conclusion for the Central Powers. American troops assisted in breaking up every one of these drives, but the Second Division, including the Marines, opposed only one, that in the Chateau-Thierry sector. It should also be noted that on March 28, 1918, the American commander in chief placed all of the American forces at the disposal of Marshal Foch, who had been agreed upon as commander in chief of the Allied Armies, to be used as he might decide., 203176=The division took the northern passage and was 13 days en route, 4 days of which were spent in holding its own against a 90-mile gale off the Newfoundland coast. On December 7, 1917, the American battleship anchored with the British Grand Fleet in Scapa Flow, Orkney Islands, after a rousing reception, and on December 26 were designated the Sixth Battle Squadron of the British Grand Fleet., 117512=The Thirteenth Regiment left the Overseas Depot at Quantico, Va., on Friday, September 13, 1918, and on September 15, 1918, sailed from Hoboken, N. J., on board the Henderson and Von Steuben, arriving at Brest, France, on September 25, 1918., 100183=The Fourth Brigade continued its training in the Bourmont training area until the middle of March, 1918, when it entered the front line trenches in the Verdun sector., 175510=That the plan was as brilliantly executed as it was daringly conceived is shown by this extract from an order of the Second Division, dated November 11, 1918, reading in part as follows:, 188878=1. On the night of November 10, heroic deeds were done by heroic men. In the face of a heavy artillery and withering machine gun fire, the Second Engineers threw two foot bridges across the Meuse and the first and second battalions of the Fifth Marines crossed resolutely and unflinchingly to the east bank and carried out their mission., 105152=Gen. Pershing and his staff, accompanied by two Marine officers, proceded the first expedition to France, sailing late in May, 1917, from the United States., 147427=The achievements of the Fourth Brigade of Marines in the Chateau-Thierry sector was twice recognized by the French. The first, which changed the name of the Bois de Belleau, was a beautiful tribute spontaneously made to the successes and to the losses of the Fourth Brigade of Marines, and shows the deep effect that the retaking of Belleau Wood and other near-by positions from the Germans had on the feelings of the French and the morale of the Allies. Official maps were immediately modified to conform with the provisions of the order, the plan directeur used in later operations bearing the name \"Bois de la Brigade de Marine.\" The French also used this new name in their orders, as illustrated by an ordre general dated August 9, 1918, signed by the commanding general of the Sixth French Army, reading in part as follows:, 232895=During the period between April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918, one officer was wounded in action, four enlisted men were killed in action, and thirteen wounded in action, in the Dominican Republic in operations against bandits., 199849=Aisne defensive, in the Chateau-Thierry sector: From May 31 to June 5, 1918., 194274=On November 17, 1918, the Second Division commenced its march to the Rhine, passing through Belgium and Luxembourg. The German frontier was reached November 25, 1918, crossed on December 1, 1918, the Rhine reached December 10, 1918, and crossed on December 13, 1918. During this march and up to the time the Fourth Brigade settled down to its occupation duty in Germany, brigade headquarters were successively established at Margut, Bellefontaine, Arlon, Usseldange, Berg, Eppeldorf, Neuerburgh, Waxweiler, Prum, Budesheim, Wiesbaum, Antweiler, Neuenahr, Burgbrohl, Rheinbrohl, and Honningen., 163681=Au Grand Quartier G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le 25 Octobre 1918. (Ordre No. 10.886 \"D.\"), 105636=On June 14, 1917, the first expedition of American troops left the United States for France and the Fifth Regiment of Marines embarked on the naval transports Henderson and Hancock, and the auxiliary cruiser De Kalb (former Printz Eitel Friedrich ), formed approximately one-fifth of it. The fourth group, including the Hancock, did not sail until June 17, 1917., 209717=In June, 1918, Vladivostok, and practically all of Siberia, was under the control of the Bolsheviki. The Bolsheviki, assisted by German and Austrian prisoners of war, were resisting the advance of the Czecho-Slovaks, who were trying to reach Vladivostok. In that city on June 29, 1918, there were approximately 12,000 well-organized Czecho-Slovaks, only about 2,500 of whom were armed or equipped. On the foregoing date the Czecho-Slovaks in the city took it over from the Bolsheviki after a three hour battle near its center, and on the afternoon of that day Rear Admiral Austin M. Knight, commander in chief of the Asiatic Fleet, ordered a detachment of American Marines ashore to guard the American consulate and to act as part of an Allied force composed of British, Japanese, Chinese, and Czecho-Slovaks, to patrol the city., 170183=On September 20, 1918, the brigade moved to an area south of Toul, with headquarters at Chaudenay. The brigade remained in this area until September 25, 1918, when it moved by rail to an area south of Chalons-sur-Marne, with headquarters at Sarry., 31028=On December 2, 1918, the President, by proclamation, directed that voluntary enlistments of registrants into the Navy and Marine, 247706=(c ) The twenty-sixth annual Sea Girt interstate tournament held at Sea Girt N.J. in 1919. The Marines won 14 of the 18 matches in which they were entered, winning the following matches: Hayes, Meany, Spencer, two-man team (New Jersey), Wingate, Libbey, all-comers expert, Cruikshank trophy, Rogers trophy, Sadler trophy, Dryden trophy, McAlpin trophy, Rogers all-comers long range, and Sea Girt championship., 235040=A Marine Corps unit arrived in France with the first expedition of of American troops. From June 26, 1917, to November 11, 1918, Marines were in Europe with the American Expeditionary Forces a total of 504 days, of which 66 days were in active sectors and 71 in quiet sectors., 279224=The Fifth Brigade Headquarters, the Thirteenth Regiment (less Company B), and the Fifth Brigade Machine Gun Battalion arrived in the United States on board the Siboney on August 8, 1919. Company B of the Thirteenth Regiment arrived on the Mercury on August 12, 1919. The Eleventh Regiment arrived in the United States on board the Orizaba on August 9, 1919., 156319=Having been blocked in the Marne salient, the Germans attacked for the fifth time in 1918 on July 15, and as events turned out it was the last, for from the time of its failure they were on the defensive. The Allied troops including many Americans held this attack, called by the Americans the Champagne-Marne defensive, which was on a large scale, and the grand initiative passed from the Germans to the Allies on July 18, 1918, when Marshal Foch launched his initial major offensive, termed by the Americans the Aisne-Marne. In this magnificent and gigantic operation the Marine Brigade and other elements of the second Division played leading parts in the vicinity of Soissons., 119017=On January 21, 1918, and on July 20, 1918, detachments for the naval base No. 13, arrived at Ponta Delgada, Azores., 256294=The strength of Marine aviation on April 6, 1917, and on November 11, 1918 was as follows:, 170733=Marshal Foch, having asked for an American division to assist in breaking through the powerful German defenses in the Champagne, the Second Division, including the Marine Brigade, was temporarily placed at the disposal of the Fourth French Army under Gen. Gouraud from September 27, 1918, to October 10, 1918. At first it was directly subject to the orders of Marshal Petain, but before the actual fighting began it was placed directly under the orders of Gen. Gouraud., 78140=The majority of the members of the first officers' training camp were graduated in July, 1918. Three hundred of this camp were commissioned on July 15, 1918, and 91 on August 15, 1918., 283035=On August 8, 1919, the Fourth Brigade of Marines was transferred to the naval service upon its arrival at Quantico, Va., 200359=Meuse-Argonne(Champagne) including the capture of Blanc Mont Ridge and St. Etienne: From October 1 to October 10, 1918., 139808=On May 27, 1918, Brig. Gen. John A. Lejeune and Maj. Earl H. Ellis sailed from New York on board the Henderson and arrived at Brest, France, on June 8, 1918., 242197=In recent years the Marine Corps has devoted a great deal of time and energy to rifle practice, believing that one of the first requirements of a soldier is to know how to shoot. During the period of the war target practice was given special attention, and in 1918 it was announced that no enlisted men would be sent overseas who had not qualified as marksman or better. This announcement created even greater interest than before in target practice among the enlisted personnel and gratifying results were obtained on all rifle ranges. Marines that arrived in France were educated riflemen, but despite that fact rifle ranges of some character were established and used in every spot of France and Germany where the Marines remained long enough to make it feasible and practicable to do so., 250585=On October 14, 1917, the First Marine Aeronautic Company was transferred to Cape May, N.J., and took over the naval air station at that place., 251541=On October 17, 1917, the First Aviation Squadron was transferred from the Marine flying field, navy yard, Philadelphia, Pa., to the Army training field at Mineola, Long Island, where instruction and training were carried on in land flying. On December 31, 1917, this organization was transferred to Gerstner Field, Lake Charles, La., for advanced training., 216632=Col. Smedley D. Butler commanded the Thirteenth Regiment from the date of its organization until November 19, 1918, on which date Lieut. Col. Douglas C. McDougal assumed command and remained its commanding officer until it was demobilized., 169494=The brigade started to move from this area on the night of September 2, 1918, and after a series of night marches, during which time headquarters were established at Pont St. Vincent, Velaine-en-Haye, and Bouvron, the brigade arrived just outside of Manonville, headquarters being established in Manonville. From September 12 to 16, 1918 the brigade was engaged in the St. Mihiel offensive in the vicinity of Remenauville, Thiaucourt, Xammes, and Jaulny as a unit of the Second Division of the First Corps of the First Army. Headquarters during these operations were successively at 1 kilometer north of Lironville, Thiaucourt, and finally at Manonville, on September 16, 1918., 169012=On August 8, 1918, Lieut. Col. Earl H. Ellis was appointed adjutant of the Fourth Brigade, relieving Lieut. Col. Harry R. Lay, who had been detailed as inspector general of the Second Division., 179431=The Second Division completed its advance on this front by the assault of the wooded heights of Mont Blanc, the key point of the German position, which was captured with consummate dash and skill. The division then repulsed violent counterattacks and then carried our lines into the village of St. Etienne, thus forcing the Germans to fall back before Rheims and yield positions which they had held since September, 1914., 248134=(d ) The American Expeditionary Forces rifle, pistol, and musketry competition, held on the d'Avours range at Le Mans, France, in May, 1919. The first three places in the individual rifle competition were won by Marines; a Marine won the individual pistol match; the Fifth Regiment of Marines stood first in the regimental standing, followed by the Thirteenth, Sixth, and Eleventh Regiments in seventh, eighth, and eleventh places in the order mentioned; a Marine won first place in the individual automatic rifle competition. The Second Division led all other divisions., 71619=The appointment of officers subsequent to the declaration of war up to October, 1917, both for the permanent service and for the temporary increase authorized for the duration of the war, were drawn from the following sources:, 249884=During April, May and June, 1917, the Marine aviation section was transferred to a combination land and water station for Marine fliers at the navy yard, Philadelphia, Pa., and the training of personnel for land flying began. The official designation of this organization was the Marine Aeronautic Company. Training in observation balloons was done in addition to the heavier-than-air-work., 75844=In carrying out the policy of obtaining officers from the ranks, orders were issued to commanding officers of every post and station of the Marine Corps, both at home and abroad, as well as those on board ship, to the effect that all commissioned officers would be taken from the ranks, and that the number of men to be designated from each post to attend the training camp would be a certain percentage of the number of men stationed at such post or station. Each commanding officer was ordered to convene a board of three officers to examine into the qualifications of the men at his post, and to report in the order of merit the names of the men considered qualified for entry to the officers' training camp at Quantico, Va. These reports were all forwarded to headquarters, where a board was convened to examine them and to select, in accordance with their standing as reported by the various boards, the number of men who it had been decided could be quartered and properly instructed at Quantico. It was found that about 600 was the limit that could be accommodated, and approximately this number was selected for the first camp, which was established at Quantico, Va., in April, 1918., 201101=General Headquarters, American Expeditionary Forces, ruled that the Second Division, including the Fourth Brigade of Marines, participated in only four major operations, the Aisne defensive (May 31 to June 5, 1918); the Aisne-Marne offensive (July 18 and 19, 1918); the St. Mihiel offensive (Sept. 12 to 16, 1918); and the Meuse-Argonne offensive (Oct. 1 to 10, 1918, and Nov. 1 to 10, 1918). The operations which resulted in the capture of Blanc Mont and St. Etienne were construed to be included in the Meuse-Argonne offensive despite the fact that the operations were a part of the operations of the Fourth French Army, far to the west of the western limit of the American Meuse-Argonne sector and further that the work of the Second Division was continued by another American division. The operation which resulted in the capture of Hill 142, Bouresches, Bois de la Brigade de Marine, by the Marine brigade, assisted by Artillery, Engineers, etc., of the Second Division, and the capture of Vaux by the Third Brigade, Engineers and Artillery of the Second Division, were held to be local engagements rather than a major operation. The Second Division suffered about 9,000 casualties in the Chateau-Thierry sector., 248724=(e ) The Inter-Allied championships held on the d'Avours range at Le Mans, France, in July, 1919. The American Expeditionary Forces team, on which were four Marines, defeated all nations. A Marine took second place in the individual rifle match., 199783=Toulon sector, Verdun: From March 15 to May 13, 1918., 203579=From the time of its arrival to November 29, 1918, this squadron with the addition of the Texas, in February, 1918, and the substitution of the Arkansas for the Delaware in July, 1918, operated with the British Grand Fleet, basing most of the time in Scapa Flow and the remainder of the time in the Firth of Forth (Rosyth). The squadron took its regular turn at convoy duty, patrol duty, target practice, and fleet exercises with all the other squadrons of the British Grand Fleet., 253664=In order to prevent the personnel, who were completely trained and ready for action when they reached the front, August 2, 1918, from getting badly out of practice, the commanding officer, Day Wing, requested permission from the British aviation forces in the vicinity to be allowed to assign certain Marine pilots to operate with their squadrons until the Marine planes were delivered. As many Marine pilots as could be accommodated were operating with British squadrons until the end of the war, and were highly complimented by the British officers. The Day Wing, carried out 14 independent raids far behind the enemy lines, did considerable damage, and brought back valuable information. The organization participated actively and creditably in both offensives on the Flanders front. It was learned after the armistice that one raid resulted in the death of 60 enemy officers and 300 enlisted men. A feat worthy of mention was performed by Marine Corps pilots. A French regiment was cut off by the enemy near Stadenburg. It was decided to attempt to feed them by aeroplane. Marine Corps pilots loaded up with food and flew low over this isolated regiment and successfully dropped 2,600 pounds of food to them in the face of heavy fire from artillery, machine guns, and rifles. This process was continued for two days until the regiment was extricate. The number of enemy planes brought down by Marine pilots, bombs dropped, food dropped, and other facts of a statistical nature are given elsewhere.

Geiger was in command., 329384=The duties of the paymaster's department during the war were greatly enlarged and made more complicated and difficult. (1) By reason of the enactment of the war risk insurance act of October 6, 1917. The work connected with family allotments and war risk insurance created by this act was of such magnitude as to require the establishment of a separate administrative section under a commissioned officer to handle the voluminous correspondence, keep the records, and make proper audit of these items in the accounts involved. It was also found necessary in order to facilitate the work of this section, that a liaison group of clerks be kept in the War Risk Bureau. (2) By reason of the taking over of the payment of all Marine Corps allotments, as the deputy of the Navy allotment officer. (3) By reason of the necessity of having to pay many men on affidavits without proper records; service record books and other papers pertaining to their accounts having been lost or destroyed by operation of war or other accidental circumstances. (4) By reason of the large number of wounded men, some of whom were scattered in various hospitals throughout France, and others of whom were returned to the United States without due notice to military authorities, and sent to both naval, military, and civil hospitals at widely scattered points throughout the States. In but a few of these cases were there any records on which full and accurate payments could be made. Hence a system of emergency, or casual payments, as they were called, was established both in France and in the United States. The absence of records in these cases was not the worst feature however, but the absence of any information whatever, as to the whereabouts of the men made it at first impossible to locate some of them and effect regular payments. However, after the first few months' experience with the handling of payments to the wounded, a system was devised by which most of those returning to the States were immediately reported and prompt payments were thereafter made. A similar system of emergency or casual payments to wounded men was adopted by the department in France, but wounded men in France were evacuated so frequently from one hospital to another, that no system of reporting was practicable. Each hospital there had to be visited in person by a paymaster at least once a month and such wounded Marines as were found, had to be paid on their own representations a sum sufficient to meet their immediate needs. Under such a system some necessarily went without pay for some time, while others more fortunate in meeting a paymaster at frequent intervals, received at times more money than was properly due them. (5) By reason of the enactment of February 24, 1919, providing a gratuity of $60 to all persons in the military and naval forces of the United States, who were discharged under honorable conditions at any time subsequent to April 6, 1917. This law necessitated the establishment at headquarters of a claims section, whose sole duty was to settle the twenty or thirty thousand supplementary claims created by this act and the act of February 28, 1919, increasing the amount of travel allowance to 5 cents per mile to all enlisted men discharged subsequent to November 11, 1918., 112753=The Sixth Machine Gun Battalion of Marines was organized at the Marine barracks, Quantico, Va., by order of the Major General Commandant on August 17, 1917.

By August 8, 1918, the movement was completed, with Headquarters established at Scarponne just across the Moselle River from Dieulouard. The sector was quiet and occupation uneventful except for an enemy raid which was successfully repulsed and prisoners captured., 285135=On May 1, 1919, it became necessary, owing to the demands of the service and the reduction of the enlisted personnel, temporarily to limit the privilege of discharge to men whose release was necessary for urgent financial dependency reasons., 178777=The Second Division conquered the complicated defense works on their front against a persistent defense worthy of the grimmest period of trench warfare and attacked the strongly held wooded hill of Blanc Mont, which they captured in a second assault, sweeping over it with consummate dash and skill. This division then repulsed strong counterattacks before the village and cemetery of St. Etienne and took the town, forcing the Germans to fail back from before Rheims and yield positions they had held since September, 1914., 73595=In order to expedite the training of the new officers, advantage was taken of the law providing for a Marine Corps Reserve, and successful candidates were immediately enrolled as second lieutenants in the reserve and ordered to Marine Corps posts for instruction pending the issuance of their commissions in the regular service. Candidates designated for the examination held July 10, 1917, were authorized upon designation to enroll as privates in the Marine Corps Reserve, with the understanding that upon the completion of their examination they would be ordered to the Recruit Depot at Parris Island, S.C., for training pending the receipt of the report of the examining board. This policy was carried out, and the successful candidates were commissioned second lieutenants in the Marine Corps, while the unsuccessful candidates were given the option of continuing in the service as enlisted men or of being discharged therefrom., 131753=The First Marine Aeronautic Company, naval base No. 13, Ponta Delgada, Azores, equipped for water flying only, performed patrol duty from January, 1918, until November 11, 1918., 289435=WAR DEPARTMENT, August 12, 1919., 173050=On September 27, 1918, Maj.

Gouraud placed his hand on the Blanc Mont Ridge and said: \"General, this position is the key of all the German defenses of this sector including the whole Rheims Massif. If this ridge can be taken the Germans will be obliged to retreat along the whole front 30 kilometers to the river Aisne. Do you think your division could effect its capture?\" Maj. Gen.
