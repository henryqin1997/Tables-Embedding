Table TST_SAMPLE_LOG stores information about the samples taken from holes, pits, and probes, and is a good raw data source for unbound layers. However, records in this table are not keyed to the layer numbers as stored in TST_L05B and TST_L05A tables (field LAYER_NO). The thickness measurement from this table can only be manually matched to the layers established in the TST_L05B table. Nevertheless, this table can be used as raw layer thickness related data source and be consulted for unbound layer material type and thickness on a case-by-case basis. Field Layer Material Type and Thickness Measurements The code list and descriptions for the \"DESCRIPTION\" field were previously given in table 1, while the code list and descriptions for field \"MATERIAL_TYPE\" (code name \"MAT_TYPE\") were previously provided in table 2. Standard deviation of the thickness measurements. STD_DEV_THICKNESS Maximum thickness measurement MAX_THICKNESS The minimum thickness of each material layer.
