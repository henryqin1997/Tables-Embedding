However, the precise quantity of opioid antagonist to be administered to the patient will depend on the opioid antagonist that is chosen. Suitable opioid antagonists include 4, 5-epoxy-3, 14-dihydroxy-17-(2-propenyl)morphinan-6-one (naloxone) and 17- (cyclopropylmethyl)-4, 5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan-6-one (naltrexone) and salts, particularly acid-addition salts and, especially, the hydrochloride, thereof The preferred daily dose range for naloxone is 0.25-10 mg, more preferably 0.5-2 mg, and for naltrexone is 10-100 mg, more preferably 25-50 mg. Where a high daily dose is required this may be administered in several units of smaller dose. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a process for preparing any of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention as described above which comprises bringing a carrier into association with the active ingredient and/or the anti-emetic and/or the opioid antagonist., 24183=This application is a continuation-in-part application based on U.S. application Ser. No. 09/011,929 filed Feb. 17, 1998, now abandoned, which is a national phase filing of PCT/GB96/02020 (WO 97/06786) with an International Filing Date of Aug. 16, 1996 (16.08.96) which claims priority to GB 9517062.7 filed Aug. 18, 1995 (18.08.95).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While a detailed description and certain preferred embodiments of the invention have been provided above, the present invention is not limited thereto, but rather is defined in the following claims. Further, the present invention has discovered that such dispersing dosage forms promote pre-gastric absorption of the active ingredient. Dopamine agonists absorbed by pre-gastric absorption pass straight into the systemic circulatory system thereby avoiding first pass metabolism in the liver. The medical community is constantly in search of improved methods and compositions for treating numerous disorders. Parkinson's disease is an especially difficult disease to treat due to the physical condition of the patient. The present invention supplies a novel way of administering dopamine agonists, such as apomorphine, which is easy for the patient to accomplish therefore reducing the need for supervision of administration. Further, the dosage form according to the invention bypasses the first pass metabolism in the liver thereby reducing the total dose.
