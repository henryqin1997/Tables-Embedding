The way in which the early 1980s recessions are included in the subsamples has implications for the magnitude of calculated volatility. In the analysis below, we follow the literature that puts the volatility break date at the first quarter of 1984, which occurs about four years after the shift in monetary policy regime., 13212=We explore several versions of the model: with and without habit persistence, high and low steady-state markups, forward-looking and contemporaneous policy rules, and an optimal monetary policy specification. Utility is specified as in equation (3.1). We chose the parameter by running a regression of the consumption velocity of M2 (consumption measured as nondurables + services) on the 3-month Treasury bill rate. It is well-known that over the full post-war sample money demand regressions suffer from parameter instability. We used sample estimates from a regression estimated over 1964-1979, which corresponds to the first subsample of our simulation analysis) to get an implied value of . We then set .The parameter on leisure is chosen so that steady-state hours worked are one-fourth of the time endowment., 12898=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers Number 873, August 2006 --- Screen Reader Version*, 8911=The volatility of the U.S. economy since the mid-1980s is much lower than it was during the prior 20-year period. The proximate causes of the increased stability and their relative importance remain unsettled, but the sharpness of the volatility decline and its timing has led authors such as Taylor (2000) to argue that a sudden shift in monetary policy is a prime candidate. Many studies in the economic volatility literature date the break in real output growth volatility around 1984, some four years after the beginning of the Volcker chairmanship of the FOMC.1 A growing body of research indicates that systematic monetary policy changed significantly with the onset of the Volcker chairmanship. For example, Gali et al. (2003) examine the Fed's systematic response to technology shocks and its implication for hours, output, and inflation. They find significant differences in the Fed's response pre-1979 and post-1979, and that post-1979 policy is close to optimal., 6617=Standard models suggest that, aside from monetary policy, a change in the volatility of TFP may have played a significant role in the increased stability of the U.S. economy. Indeed, recent work by Arias et al. (2006) supports this view. Another plausible candidate for the less-volatile economy is a change in the magnitude and frequency of oil shocks. To assess the relative contributions of shocks and monetary policy to the decline in U.S. economic volatility we build a standard, sticky-price monetary model of the business cycle. The model is simulated over the high-volatility period 1956-1979 and the low-volatility period 1984-1999. The simulations use measured historical TFP, oil shocks, and monetary policy rules. Counterfactual analysis is used to quantify the relative contributions of TFP and oil shocks as well as monetary policy to the decline in output and inflation volatility since 1984., 11080=An equilibrium model is used to assess the quantitative importance of monetary policy for the post-1984 decline in U.S. inflation and output volatility. The principal finding is that monetary policy played a substantial role in reducing inflation volatility, but a small role in reducing real output volatility. The model attributes much of the decline in real output volatility to smaller TFP shocks. We also investigate the pattern of output and inflation volatility under an optimal monetary policy counterfactual. We find that real output volatility would have been somewhat lower, and inflation volatility substantially lower, had monetary policy been set optimally., 7833=Has monetary policy played a quantitatively significant role in the volatility decline? Recent work by Boivin and Giannoni (2003) argues yes: their estimated structural models imply a reduced effect of monetary policy shocks in the post-1980 period that is almost entirely explained by an increase in the Fed's responsiveness to inflation and output. Their estimates suggest that the monetary transmission mechanism was different pre-1979 compared to post-1979, with most of the difference traced to a change in the monetary policy rule rather than to a change in private-sector behavior. On the other hand, the VAR analysis in Stock and Watson (2002), Stock and Watson (2003), Ahmed et al. (2004), and Primiceri (2003) indicates that monetary policy played little role in the moderation of output volatility, though it perhaps played a role in lowering the volatility of inflation.2 These studies tend to indicate that smaller shocks hitting the economy are the principal cause of the moderation in U.S. volatility.3, 3563=What stands out for both output growth and inflation volatility are the low values of the 1990s, both of which are about half the level achieved in the 1970s and 1980s. Several studies have identified a breakpoint in real output growth volatility around 1984Q1. The table shows, using that break date, output growth volatility dropped by about half in the post-1984Q1 sample. For the standard deviation of inflation, the 1984 break date implies a dramatic decline on the order of 0.45 percentage points. If the sample is split at 1979Q3, corresponding to a commonly determined monetary policy break date, inflation volatility is seen to decline a more modest 0.13 percentage points. Clearly though, inflation volatility in the 1990s was a good bit lower than over the preceding decades., 10168=*We thank an anonymous referree, Shaghil Ahmed, Satyajit Chatterjee, Sanjay Chugh, Luca Dedola, Mike Dotsey, James Hamilton, John Leahey, Frank Schorfheide and seminar participants at the 2003 Society for Economic Dynamics meetings and the 2005 Econometric Society meetings for their comments.

To offset the expected upward pressure on prices, the monetary authority lowers the growth rate of money, which in equilibrium lowers the rate of inflation on impact. Since the post-1984 interest-rate rule places relatively more weight on expected inflation compared to the pre-1979 policy rule, the movement in the inflation rate is more stable in the post-1984 period than in the pre-1979 one. Along the inflation dimension, the post-1984 monetary authority's response to a TFP shock is relatively closer to the optimal response, which keeps the inflation rate constant., 68230=McConnell, M.

Variance properties of solow\ufffds productivity residual and their cyclical implications. Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 19, 1249\ufffd1282., 62726=We used a structural model to assess the relative contributions of monetary policy, TFP shocks, and oil shocks to the decline in volatility of U.S. real output and inflation. In line with the empirical results in Stock and Watson (2002), our benchmark model predicts that monetary policy played a relatively small role in the decline in volatility of real output, accounting for about 17 percent of the drop. On the other hand, it suggests that monetary policy accounted for about 30 percent of the decline in inflation volatility. The model suggests that smaller TFP shocks and oil shocks are the principal cause of the more stable real economy post-1984. An important component of the analysis is the calculation of optimal monetary policy in a model with endogenous capital accumulation. Relative to the estimated historical Taylor rules, optimal policy would have virtually eliminated inflation variability and significantly lowered real output volatility., 42648=When solving the model using Clarida et al. pre-1979 policy rule estimates, we are able to find a determinate equilibrium even though the Fed responds \"passively\" to expected inflation. This result is in line with Dupor (2001) who shows that an interest-rate rule for which the monetary authority lowers the real interest rate following a rise in inflation can bring about a unique equilibrium in models with capital accumulation.14, 64923=Bullard, J., Eusepi, S., 2003.

Empirically, the standard deviation of real output falls 45 percent, from 2.11 percent to 1.16 percent.

Has monetary policy become more effective? National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 9459., 46576=Our benchmark model is one for which there are no habits in preferences, monetary policy follows a forward-looking rule as in equation (3.22), and the steady-state markup is 4 percent. The model is simulated over two subsamples: 1964Q1 to 1979Q2 and 1984Q2 to 1999Q3. We chose to end the sample in 1999Q3 so that the subsamples are of equal length. The 1979Q3 to 1984Q4 period is dropped from the analysis for two reasons. First, many studies date a break in monetary policy at the beginning of the Volcker regime in October 1979. At the same time, statistical evidence puts the break in real output volatility around 1984Q1, and as seen in Table 1, whether or not the 1980-1983 data are included in the volatility calculations has a significant effect on the resulting statistics. Second, Sims and Zha (2002) argue that the episode from 1980 to 1982 appears to be different in terms of monetary policy, and that it is not the case that there was a dramatic shift in policy between the 1960-78 period and the 1983-2000 period., 69734=Taylor, J.

The new neoclassical synthesis and the role of monetary policy. In: NBER Macroeconomics Annual. MIT Press, Cambridge and London, pp. 231\ufffd83., 41655=To characterize historical monetary policy, we assume that systematic policy follows a Taylor rule that sets the short-term nominal interest rate as a function of the output gap and expected inflation (see equation 3.22). We parameterize the policy rule using the estimates in Clarida et al. (2000) for the pre-1979 and the post-1982 periods (see Table 4).12 Clarida et al. estimate a forward-looking rule on GDP deflator inflation and the CBO output gap. Their estimates suggest the Fed increased the nominal funds rate less than one-for-one with expected inflation in the pre-1979 sample which, in their model, leads to indeterminacy. Their post-1982 estimates show that the Fed raised the funds rate more than one-for-one with expected inflation.13, 69868=Woodford, M., 2003. Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy. Princeton University Press, Princeton and Oxford., 55182=The model predicts that real output volatility would have been lower than what was observed in the historical data had policy been set according to the Ramsey plan. When the planner keeps inflation roughly constant, the decline in real output volatility between the pre-1979 and the post-1984 eras is 41 percent versus the 45-percent decline measured from the U.S. data. Real output volatility in the pre-1979 period drops by about 25 percent under optimal policy compared to the data. By reducing the volatility of inflation, the planner reduces the effects of the inflation tax, which lowers the fluctuations in labor and capital inputs, and ultimately in output., 63920=Arias, A., Hansen, G., Ohanian, L., 2006.

American Economic Review 94, 190\ufffd217., 49235=Panel B of Table 5 shows that the benchmark specification is close to matching the decline in the standard deviation of inflation from the pre-1979 to the post-1984 period, predicting a decline in inflation volatility of about 51 percent, compared to 54 percent in the data. The model underpredicts the levels of inflation volatility in both sub-periods: the benchmark specification accounts for only 20 percent of the standard deviation of inflation., 53170=Although we did not calculate the direct contribution of oil shocks to the decline in volatility, Table 7 provides evidence on the importance of oil shocks for business cycle volatility in the two sub-periods. To measure that contribution, we compare the volatility predictions of a model that has both TFP and oil shocks to one that has TFP shocks only. In the pre-1979 specification, oil shocks account for about 3 percent of the standard deviation of output and about 4 percent of the standard deviation of inflation. In the post-1984 period, the contribution is larger: 9 percent of the standard deviation of output and 19 percent of the standard deviation of inflation. Thus, our simulations suggest that oil shocks play a substantially larger role in accounting for the business-cycle volatility of output and inflation volatility in the post-1984 period. This occurs not because of an increase in oil shocks in the post-1984 period (in fact, there are fewer), but rather because of the general reduction in volatility due to other shocks., 66505=Hamilton, J. D., 1983. Oil and the macroeconomy since world war II. Journal of Political Economy 91, 228\ufffd248., 43666=We treat quantity, rather than price, as exogenous because of the sharp change in the oil market over the postwar period. While Hamilton (1983, 1985) convincingly argues that the price of oil can be taken as exogenous during the period 1948-1972, since the end of the 1970s, the time series properties of the price of oil are much different, and the price appears to be much more affected in the short run by world demand conditions. These facts pose a challenge for a model that assumes exogenous oil prices when accounting for the change in economic volatility over the postwar era. Our solution of treating quantity as exogenous is not without problems though-the method allows domestic TFP to affect the price of oil prior to 1973. We are assuming that treating quantity, rather than price, as exogenous leads to more consistent treatment of the oil market pre-1973 and post-1973., 68088=Lucas, R. E., Stokey, N. L., 1987.

Table 5, Panel A, shows that the contemporaneous Taylor rule results in an output volatility drop that underpredicts that in the data, while the model with habit persistence generates a slightly larger decline in real output volatility relative to the benchmark and the data. The high markup model shows the smallest drop in real output volatility, since it makes the post-1984 period too volatile., 64420=Bils, M., Klenow, P. J., 2002.

Optimal simple and implementable monetary and fiscal policy rules. Manuscript, Duke University., 57272=An important difference between the model under optimal policy and under the pre-1979 or post-1984 Taylor rules is the behavior of markups. King and Goodfriend (1997) argue that markups act like distortionary taxes and that optimal policy should therefore attempt to keep them constant. Indeed, we find that under optimal monetary policy, markup variability is largely eliminated. Output volatility is reduced under optimal monetary policy in part because reducing the volatility of the markup lowers the variation in labor and capital inputs, which ultimately results in more stable real output Model simulations suggest that markup volatility is about 5 percent lower under the post-84 monetary policy rule when compared to the pre-79 policy rule. Hence, the post-84 rule appears to be closer to optimal., 68422=Orphanides, A., 2004. Monetary policy rules, macroeconomic stability and inflation: A veiw from the trenches.

Solutions are found for the pre-1979 and post-1984 calibrations. The models are then simulated assuming the pre-1979 and post-1984 economies are independent.18 Thus, we implicitly assume that households in the pre-1979 subsample thought the monetary policy rule would forever stay at its pre-1979 calibration. Transition dynamics between the regimes are not modeled. The form of the monetary policy rule requires a measure of potential output.
