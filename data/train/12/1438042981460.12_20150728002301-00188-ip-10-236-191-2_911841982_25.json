    "textAfterTable": "While I haven't yet joined into any clubs I've heard and read on the many billboards located across campus that there are dozens of different clubs to join ranging from art, drama, pottery, reading groups, computer clubs, chess clubs, etc. Other than joining a club there is a pool hall for students to go to whenever they have free time to goof off. Food and Dining The catering service is very delicious and has many choices of food. There is the pizza section, fried foods section, deli section, and the health food section. Each section has it's own cooks and each has it's own menus with a list of different foods to get ranging from cheeseburgers (I'd really recommend those) to chicken wraps to pepperoni pizza. Dorm Life I don't live at the dorm, but from what I've heard it is quite pleasant. I've also heard it is peaceful and quiet and the students there are very friendly and easy to cooperate with. And from what I've seen, the dorm area is very clean and kept that way every day. Academic Rigor I don't care what anyone else says, the classes here are just as challenging as any state college. They can be frustrating",
