            "The campus is in the middle of no where. Literally, the only time you are in danger is if you allow yourself to be alone in a dangerous place, be safe don't drink and you should be fine.",
            "There is no Greek. At all.",
            "Great for more reserved people. Everyone is really chill, and since the campus is small your get to know everyone, takes the pressure of meeting new people off of your shoulders.",
            "There is a cross on top of a hill, it is a steep walk, and yet people like to go there to get drunk. :) Sober is it really pretty at night. Plus, we have the letters SMC on a hill, all Freshmen get to paint it by hand. AWESOME.",
            "The education is definitely worth it, the dorm and food is a rip off and I need to stop talking about it or I will get very angry.",
            "I like to go hiking and exploring. There are a lot of trails and hidden wooded areas to explore. Or, you can take the Bart to San Francisco. Or, just chill, if your are studying right that is all you are going to want to do.",
            "ugh, the food tastes great the first few days, then you notice that the food gets worse and worse. The unlimited plan is worth it though, trust me, though the food isn't the best, it is good enough at 9:30 at night when everything closes in the town.",
            "There is nothing around town to do, so weekends can be pretty boring if you are as poor as I am (which most college students are). Plus, the dorms don't really do anything exciting, the RAs mainly bring food for fun.",
            "I put such a high mark for the science and math classes. I found seminar (which you will learn about there) and English to be pretty reasonable. Not that they are easy, but they are not break your back hard. The sciences and math classes though will make you work!",
            "The only tip that I can give, it so visit the campus. I knew nothing about this school, and I almost didn't accept my spot, that was until I went to the school and allowed myself to see what the campus was actually like.",
            "I love this school, the campus is small and it is easy to get comfortable here-- because the school is so small you get a chance to know everyone in your class by name. The teachers all know you, and that means that you have many opportunities to get help. If you are intimidated by large school, this might be for you."

The classes are very interesting and close-knit, especially those during Jan Term., 34777=The Academic program at Saint Mary's is on of a kind. Aside from getting a major they really make sure you receive a fully rounded education through their diversity requirements and Jan term. They also offer a lot of tutoring and assistance in order to make sure every student will succeed., 64405=saint mary's has really great classes and even a jan term, but compared to my standards, the classes could be harder. sometimes i feel that it's pretty much senior year of high school, but with more reading and studying. as long as you actually study, you should do fine., 113028=Saint Mary's is the perfect combination of small school utilities with certain big school aspects. It has small class sizes which are essential in the professor-student relationships that are formed, but it has division one sports and is located in the San Francisco Bay Area making it far from your typical small school. Finally, the collegiate seminar program and Saint Mary's unique January term, it provides student with one of a kind educational opportunities., 306210=Probably a little overpriced, but there are high qualtity professors, most have at least a masters degree in selected field. A new recreactional center is in progress of being built and will be finished by Spring 2015 and that will be very very nice to have, 123525=ugh, the food tastes great the first few days, then you notice that the food gets worse and worse. The unlimited plan is worth it though, trust me, though the food isn't the best, it is good enough at 9:30 at night when everything closes in the town., 74128=the academics here are tough, but helpful. i find myself doing a lot of homework, but i do learn a lot, which is what school is all about. since saint mary's is a catholic school, religion does play into the academics some, but if you aren't that religious it doesn't matter because it's not an overpowering factor of this school. we also have jan term, which is where you take a class that doesn't have to do with your major (unless you want it to) for the month of january, which is really fun. and of course, there's study abroad., 326938=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 233568=Contact at least one administrator on campus because they will direct you practically to anyone or anywhere. The more you talk to people the more connections you can make and pretty soon you have 10 people who are willing to help you with anything. The sooner you turn in your application the sooner you get a response which is very helpful because most schools wait till April to hand out decisions., 291876=During the Weekend of Welcome, students are thrust into multiple large campus activities such as Freshman Olympics, Painting the SMC, Hiking to the Cross, and Pool Parties. But the most famous tradition we have is Jan Term, which is where the entire month of January is set aside for students to take only one class for 2-4 hours 4 times a week. Each year there is a theme, but not all classes follow the theme. Students are encouraged to choose classes outside their major such as Harry Potter and Barbarians!, but they also offer classes like math and language. This is a way for students to slowly get back into the feel of classes after winter break and also give plenty of time for campus events., 16750=SMC has a unique 4-1-4 semester system. We have four-month long semesters with a one month January Term break in between. During Jan term, students study only one class not necessarily related to their majors. This gives them time to explore other interests or pursue individual projects like community service. Last year, one of my friends took a course on chocolate making during this time and travel courses are available for Jan Term, too., 233053=Last year in 2012 every single student who applied for Medical School was accepted into their first choice school! What also is really impressive is the upperclassmen all talk differently. They can express their ideas very easily with accuracy and smooth fluency; creating an overall sophisticated and articulate speech.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The campus is beautiful, the buildings on campus is reminiscent of Spanish Missions and there are trees and grass all over campus. The campus certainly has enough room for anything you need, but is compact enough to walk from one side to another in no more than 10 minutes. The weather is pretty nice, it is sunny during the day but it gets cool during the night and morning. These is a feeling of peace on campus that is perfect for an educational institution and really gets you in the mood for learning and being relaxed. They offer many things to the students such as dances and events held by the Campus Activities Board. Some of the things that I've attended is friendship bracelet making night, Salsa lessons, and a pretty big school dance. They offer yoga, pilates, and other fitness classes that are free for students to attend. They also have a counseling center, where you can get a therapist or counselor to talk to for free to manage stress. There are many clubs and organizations that are on campus to be a part of and many of them go on trips to San Francisco, Southern California, and Tahoe during winter. Am learning a lot This college is an excellent school if your goal of going to college",
