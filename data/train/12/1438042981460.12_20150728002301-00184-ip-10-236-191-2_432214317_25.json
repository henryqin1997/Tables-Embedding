            "Description",
            "Flex cable assembly for vibration reduction in HDD applications - A hard disk drive flex cable assembly conveys data between a connector to a host system and a head stack assembly. It comprises a flex cable which in part has a first end for coupling to the connector, and a second end for coupling to the head stack assembly; and a stiffener coupled to the second end. The stiffener comprises an end formed to approximate a J-shape. A filling material is applied to the concave surface of the J-shape, whereby a dynamic response frequency of the flex cable assembly is moved away from a dynamic response frequency of the head stack assembly upon which the flex cable assembly is coupled.",
            "Flex cable assembly for robust right angle interconnect - A hard disk drive flex cable assembly, for conveying data between a connector to a host system and a head stack assembly, comprises a flex cable, which in part has a first end for coupling to the connector, and a second end for coupling to the head stack assembly; and a stiffener coupled to the second end, wherein the stiffener supports at least one termination pad of the second end on three sides of the termination pad.",
            "Outer actuator arm constrained layer dampers - Outer arm constrained layer dampers to improve actuator dynamics are disclosed. One embodiment provides a housing and disk pack mounted to the housing and having a plurality of disks that are rotatable relative to the housing. In addition, an actuator is coupled to the housing, the actuator having a plurality of suspensions arms for reaching over the plurality of disks. A first damper is coupled with an outside (or inside) portion of a top outside suspension arm of the plurality of suspensions arms. In addition, a second damper is coupled with an outside (or inside) portion of a bottom suspension arm of the plurality of suspensions arms. In so doing, vibration modes involving deformation of the top suspension arm and the bottom suspension arm are damped.",
            "Flex cable assembly damper - A flex cable assembly for a head stack assembly of a hard disk drive comprises a flex cable for conducting data signals from the head stack assembly to a connector. The flex cable comprises a dynamic loop section between a termination for the head stack assembly and the connector. A constrained layer damper is attached adjacently to an area of the flex cable that is configured to receive the coupler. The constrained layer damper extends into the dynamic loop section of the flex cable.",
            "ASYMMETRIC COMB BORE IN ACTUATOR DESIGN - The present invention generally relates to a head comb for use in a hard disk drive. In one embodiment, the head comb comprises a core body having a bore formed therethrough. The bore is bound by walls having a top extension extending into the opening and a bottom extension extending into the opening. The top extension has a first height, and the bottom extension has a second height that is different than the first height."

The valve cover may include a cover body, and a sparkplug tube formed integrally with the cover body. In this way, any distortion of the bottom end of the sparkplug tubes due to, for example removal and reinstallation may not provide a leakage path. 20140150746 12-26-2013 Cooling Strategy for Engine Head with Integrated Exhaust Manifold - A cooling apparatus for an integrated exhaust manifold includes: a first cooling jacket configured to surround a portion of an exhaust manifold; and a second cooling jacket configured to surround another portion of the exhaust manifold. The first cooling jacket includes a first portion sitting atop the second cooling jacket and a second portion adjacent the second cooling jacket and positioned lower than the first portion. 20130340692 Published Description Patent application number Paul Thomas Reinhart, Livonia, MI US 11-24-2011 System and Method for Returning Oil Separated from Engine Crankcase Gases - A system for processing PCV gases is disclosed. In one example, the system includes an oil passage solely linking an oil separator to an engine crankcase. The system can provide an oil column that provides for continuous oil return from the oil separator to the engine crankcase even during conditions of higher levels of engine vacuum. 20110283979",
