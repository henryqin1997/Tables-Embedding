For example, the natural account 1210 is mistakenly classified under 'AR' group account number when it should be classified under 'AP' group account number. When this happens, the ETL program will charge all the GL journal lines to account 1210 and try to reconcile these GL journal lines against subledger accounting records in the AR fact table (W_AR_XACT_F). Since these GL journal lines did not come from AR, the ETL program will not be able to find the corresponding subledger accounting records for these GL journal lines. In this case, the ETL program will insert 'Manual' records into the AR fact table because it thinks that these GL journal lines are 'Manual' journal entries created directly in the GL system charging to the AR accounts.

In the CSV file, you specify the system code and user defined code and associate it with the category to which you want the UDCs loaded. This data is loaded into UDC_CATEGORY_MAP_TMP table, which leverages the data and loads the relevant codes into the Code dimension. 00 CN COUNTRY Categories in W_CODE_D are used to group together codes intended for a similar purpose. For example, UDC 00||CN stores the country code and description. To store this under the COUNTRY category in W_CODE_D, enter the following row in the CSV file: There are three columns in the CSV file. The first two columns are used to identify the system codes and user defined codes. Together, these columns are used to identify the UDCs that will be loaded into W_CODE_D. The third column is the category into which you want to load the codes in W_CODE_D. Before you configure the CSV file, identify the UDCs that you need depending on the functional module that you are loading. Choose only the UDCs in transactional tables that are involved in the ETL process. Oracle recommends preparing a list of UDCs that you can refer to when configuring the CSV file.

When the ETL for Code dimension is started, all UDCs that are found in this table, along with their mappings to respective categories, are extracted from the source and loaded into the W_CODE_D table. Determining how to associate UDCs with categories requires looking at the SILO mappings, where the descriptions are resolved through lookups in W_CODE_D. The category is hard coded in the lookups. To resolve descriptions from W_CODE_D, you must ensure that the UDCs are loaded into the proper categories.

Therefore, a configurable flat file is provided to populate quarter information. This configuration file enables you to feed quarter information such as Quarter Number for each period, Quarter Start Date, and Quarter End Date.
