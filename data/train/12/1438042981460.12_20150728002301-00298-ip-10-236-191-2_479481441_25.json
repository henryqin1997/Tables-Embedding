    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32367=FIG. 6 is a 200\ufffd magnification SEM photograph of a calendered (2000 pli) airlaid composite of 466 gsm total weight composed of 400 gsm pulp fiber, 3.4% by weight bicomponent fiber, and 10.7% by weight moisture., 119793=Composites were made as described above in Example 1 and regain absorbency was tested as shown below in Table 7. Uncalendered absorbency is the absorbency of a sample which was tested after the sample had been heated, but before water add-on and calendering. The sample was tested with a 1 minute soak time, 1 minute drain time, and 1500 ml of water. The calendered absorbency was as described above for a sample of the present invention., 110521=An airlaid composite sample was made as described above in Example 1 of 400 gsm pulp fiber and 32 gsm (8% by weight of the pulp fiber) bicomponent fiber, except that moisture was added-on using a hand held spray mister and the composite was calendered at a pressure of 2000 pli with various moisture add-on percentages, as shown below in Table 6. Samples were prepared having an area of 20.25 square inches (130.64 cm2). Of the resulting materials, the material calendered with moisture between 11.2 percent and 18.1 percent achieved the desired balance of properties of weight, thickness and density, while also having a uniform, non-linty appearance., 84747=The additional cooling and moisturizing was conducted using a spray atomizer which added a quantity of water as noted in the table below at a rate of 1019 gallons/min. (3857.3 l/min) to the airlaid composite. A vacuum box under the forming wiire applied a vacuum of 1.08 psi (7472 Pa) to draw the water evenly through the airlaid composite. The composite was then wound onto a roll 30 inches (76.2 cm) wide as it was being cut into narrower widths of about 9 inches (22.9 cm). The rolled composite was then placed in an airtight bag to maintain the moisture content for a period sufficient for uniform moisture distribution throughout the composite., 45904=The airlaid composite will have a basis weight of 50-500 gsm and is calendered from an initial thickness of approximately 0.50 inches to 0.75 inches (1.27-1.91 cm) and density of about 0.02-0.05 g/cc. As used herein, the term \u201ccalendering\u201d means that the airlaid composite has been compressed at a pressure of about 800 to 4000 pounds per linear inch (pli) (143-715 kg/linear cm) preferably 1500-3000 pli (268-536 kg/linear cm), more preferably 2000-3000 pli (358-536 kg/linear cm), to form a thin, calendered airlaid composite having a thickness to basis weight ratio of 3.0\ufffd10\u22123 mm/1 gsm to 1.0\ufffd10\u22123 mm/1 gsm, a thickness of 0.025-0.15 cm and a density of 0.5 g/cc or higher. Such calendering is not the same as the compaction and compression usually utilized in the air laying industry. Instead, it is closer to that which is used in the paper industry (known as \u201csuper calendering\u201d) in that it is conducted at much higher pressures. It is Applicants' theory that such calendering is critical in forming the airlaid composite of the present invention because this creates stored energy in the airlaid composite due to the hydrogen bonding, three-dimensional orientation of the pulp fibers and the resilient nature of the pulp fibers. Subsequent contact with polar fluids (e.g. absorbing water or water-based solutions such as exudate) allows the pulp fibers to separate and return to a more relaxed configuration resulting in an open porous structure suitable for absorbency. FIG. 6 shows a 200\ufffd magnification of a SEM photograph of an airlaid composite (466 gsm total weight) having 400 gsm pulp fiber with 3.4% by weight bicomponent fiber and 10.7% by weight moisture, where the airlaid composite has been calendered at 2000 pli. FIG. 7 shows a 60\ufffd magnification cross-sectional side view SEM photograph of a calendered (2000 pli) airlaid composite (349 gsm total weight) of 300 gsrn pulp fiber, 3.4% by weight bicomponent fiber, and 10.7% by weight moisture. These figures show a dense absorbent structure having bicomponent fibers bound to many of the pulp fibers such that the thin, calendered structure exhibits unexpectedly good absorbent properties while being in a dense, thin form., 81966=Samples were tested in both the CD and MD and results expressed in grams to break. Higher numbers indicate a stronger structure. The specimen was tested, for example, on an 1130 Instron, available from the Instron Corporation, or a Thwing-Albert Model INTELLECT II available from the Thwing-Albert Instrument Co., 10960 Dutton Rd., Philadelphia, Pa. 19154. Additionally, unless otherwise noted, the samples were tested under dry conditions, which includes only the moisture add-on which was necessary to form the airlaid composite. Where noted, some samples were also tested under wet conditions, which added fluid or exudate to the sample to test strength performance under conditions which more closely resemble actual use. In such cases, 10 mL of fluid was applied and tested instantaneously to the center of the sample prior to subjecting it to the test as described above., 32597=FIG. 7 is a 60\ufffd magnification cross-sectional side view SEM photograph of a calendered (2000 pli) airlaid composite of 349 gsm total weight composed of 300 gsm pulp fiber, 3.4% by weight bicomponent fiber, and 10.7% by weight moisture., 76559=The \u201cDrape Stiffness\u201d test measures the drape stiffness or resistance to bending of the composite. The bending length is a measure of the interaction between the composite weight and stiffness as shown by the way in which the composite bends under its own weight, in other words, by employing the principle of cantilever bending of the composite under its own weight. In general, the sample was slid at 4.75 inches per minute (12 cm/min), in a direction parallel to its long dimension, so that its leading edge projected from the edge of a horizontal surface. The length of the overhang was measured when the tip of the sample was depressed under its own weight to the point where the line joining the tip to the edge of the platform made a 41.50 angle with the horizontal. The longer the overhang, the slower the sample was to bend; thus, higher numbers indicate stiffer composites. This method conforms to specifications of ASTM Standard Test D 1388., 29988=The present invention pertains to an airlaid composite which is made of pulp fibers, at least about 2% by weight bicomponent fiber, and moisture. This airlaid composite is unique in that a uniformly even composite is made which upon calendering, becomes a thin structure which maintains significant absorbency when saturated. The bicomponent fibers of the present invention include a first polymer component and a second polymer component, and the first polymer component melts at a temperature lower than the melting temperature of the second polymer component. Mixing of the pulp fibers with the bicomponent fibers is done in such a way that the fibers are evenly dispersed in the airlaid composite. This airlaid composite is then heated such that at least a portion of the first polymer component of the bicomponent fiber is melted, which bond the bicomponent fibers to many of the pulp and bicomponent fibers when cooled. Moisture is added on to the composite to further facilitate bonding when the composite is subsequently subjected to calendering. Optionally, a sheet layer may be attached to the airlaid composite to form a multi-layered absorbent structure. Such composites and absorbent structures are characterized by a drape stiffness of at least about 5 cm, an absorbency of at least about 12 g/g, and a dry tensile strength of at least about 1300 g., 85416=The moisturized airlaid composite was then removed from the bag and unwound for calendering. A sheet layer of 0.4 mil fluid impervious polyethylene film (available as SF 181 from Huntsman Corporation of Salt Lake City, Utah) was unwound with the airlaid composite and calendered together at a pressure of 2000 pli (357.2 kg/linear cm). Five repetitions of the thus formed thin, calendered multi-layered absorbent structure were tested as described above and had properties as shown below in Table 1., 24118=This application is a division of application Ser. No. 09/290,713, filed Apr. 12, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,368,609, which claims the benefit of Provisional application Ser. No. 60/111,671, filed Dec. 10, 1998., 69723=The thin, calendered airlaid composite or multi-layered absorbent structure thus formed has a strength sufficient such that it may be rolled up or handled in sheet form for storage, transportation or unwinding purposes, and sufficient to prevent sloughing or otherwise breaking up when saturated. Tensile strength, (both wet and dry), has been measured for the airlaid composites of the present invention as discussed more fully below in the examples. It has been found that these composites exhibit machine direction (MD) dry tensile strength in the range of about 1500-10,500 grams and cross machine direction (CD) dry tensile strength in the range of about 1300-6900 grams., 52032=The tissue layer may be a composite of cellulosic fibers having a basis weight of 10-30 lbs./ream (4.5-13.6 kg/ream). The tissue layer may also be a multi-ply layer. Applications wherein the absorbent pad is embedded within a food tray as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,377 to Grone would be a particularly useful application for an airlaid composite of the present invention including a tissue layer. The tissue layer would thus provide a non-contacting separation layer between the food and the airlaid composite.}",
