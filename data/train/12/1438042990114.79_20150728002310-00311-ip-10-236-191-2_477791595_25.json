    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{224602=[0103] The way in which the microcontroller 61 processes the new command depends upon its current mode of operation, i.e. whether or not it is in its on-demand mode of operation or its streaming mode of operation. If the microcontroller 61 is in its on-demand mode, then it retrieves the appropriate data to be transmitted (e.g. from the buffer 33, the azimuth sensor 25, the usage counter 73 etc.) which it passes to the message generator 65 which adds the appropriate message identifier and puts the data into the appropriate format as defined above. This message data is then passed to a checksum determining unit 67 which calculates an appropriate checksum for the message which it appends to the end of the message. The message is then passed back to the message generator 65 which outputs the message for encoding and transmission. If the microcontroller 61 is currently in its streaming mode of operation when it receives the new command, then it controls the message generator 65 to insert the requested message within the stream following the current message being transmitted, after which the microcontroller 61 continues streaming in accordance with the current streaming plan. In this embodiment, when the microcontroller 61 is in its streaming mode of operation, it waits 500 milliseconds after the end of transmitting one message, or for 1000 milliseconds after the start of the previous message, whichever is later, before instructing the message generator 65 to start outputting the next message for transmission. By ensuring that there is at least a 500 millisecond gap between transmitted messages, sufficient time is provided for the remote navigation control centre 11 to be able to transmit a command to the navigation control unit 13 and be sure that the navigation control unit 13 will be able to detect the transmitted command. Without these gaps between messages, there is a risk that once the navigation control unit 13 has started streaming, it might not be able to detect commands transmitted from the remote navigation control centre 11., 269614=[0139] In this embodiment, messages transmitted from the remote navigation control centre 11 are also transmitted using the same character set used by the navigation control unit 30 and using the same delta encoding technique. In this embodiment, there is a relatively small amount of data to be transmitted from the remote navigation control centre 11 to the navigation control unit 13 mounted with the user. Consequently, in this embodiment the sequence of DTMF tones generated and transmitted from the remote navigation control centre 11 have a longer duration and a longer silence period between the tones. In particular, in this embodiment, each of the DTMF tones has a duration of 100 ms and is followed by a silence period of 50 ms. In other words, the DTMF tones transmitted to the navigation control unit 13 have a mark space ratio of 2:1., 268586=[0137] The character sequence generated by the delta coder 87 (for example, like the one shown in FIG. 5D) is then output to the DTMF generator 89 which generates DTMF tones in accordance with Table 2 above. In this embodiment, the DTMF generator 89 is arranged to generate the first tone of a message as a burst of 100 ms of tone followed by a 6 ms silence period. The remaining tones of the message are then transmitted as a burst of 50 ms of the tone followed by a 6 ms silence period. Therefore, in this embodiment, the navigation control unit 13 can transmit one character every 56 ms, with a mark space ratio of 25:3. These tones pass through the switch 72 and the hands free kit 5 to the mobile telephone 3, where the DTMF tones get transmitted to the remote navigation control centre 11 via the base station 9 and the switching network 12.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0172] In the above embodiment, a particular checksum technique was used to calculate a checksum for each message transmitted from the user's navigation control unit to the remote navigation control centre. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, it is not essential to calculate or transmit such a checksum. However, providing some form of mechanism to validate the received data is preferred so that errors in the transmission can be detected. Further, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, it is not essential to use the particular checksum technique described above. Other simpler checksum techniques may be used. Further, in the particular checksum process described above, the characters in the message were processed in sequential order from the first character in the message to the last character in the message. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, this is not essential. The checksum may be calculated by processing the characters in the message in any predetermined order. [0171] In the above embodiment, the navigation data transmitted from the user's navigation control unit to the remote navigation control centre and the requests and commands transmitted from the remote navigation control centre to the user's navigation control unit were transmitted using a delta encoding scheme which ensured that no two consecutive characters that were transmitted are the same. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, this is not essential.",
