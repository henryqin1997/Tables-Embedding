The staff is helpful and usually makes up for it though. For a private school the tuition is great, for school year 2012-2013 it was 2 dollars cheaper than the local community college. I have never had a teacher I couldn't get along with, and some of the staff are really excellent. Sadly the staff in the Financial aid office and few in the Academic office need better training or something, sometimes a student can spend half a day bouncing between offices and accomplish nothing more than getting dizzy. You are usually better off talking to the head of your program, they are usually wonderful academic advisors who will move mountains for you. Don't be afraid to ask them for help!}",
