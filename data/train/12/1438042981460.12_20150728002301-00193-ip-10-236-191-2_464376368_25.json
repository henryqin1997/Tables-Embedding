However, there is an item that will change your slot color depending on what spellstone it has equipped. This item can be purchased around halfway through the story Full (100%) exp rate if the spellstone equipped matches the slot color 3/4 (75%) exp rate if the spellstone equipped doesn't match the slot color Color determines how much exp you will gaining for your spellstone Levels also gain exp over time (by equipping it), so even if you have a ring that only has 3-1-1, you can still level it up to 9-9-9 At a certain point in the story, you will be able to purchase an item from various shops that will increase the ring's lowest slot level by 1. Levels will determine the maximum level of a spellstone that you can equip. If you have a level 3 slot, then you can only equip lvl 3 spellstones and below. You will be able to equip a spellstone in each slot. Each ring has 3 slots, and each slot has a designated \"level\" and \"color\" About Rings A spellstone's effect (e.g MOV UP +3 = +60% MOV) is still in FULL effect regardless of slot level or slot color, provided that it isn't crossed out in the first place",
