The following rows would all be permitted: A table is keyed on its searchable columns. This means that each row in the table must have a unique combination of values in the searchable columns. For example, if a table has one searchable column, each table row must have a unique value in that column, no two rows can contain the same value. When an NIS+ table is created, one or more columns are designated searchable with either the S or the I flags as described in \"Specifying Table Columns\". You can use the niscat -o tablename command to display a list of a table's columns and their characteristics. nistbladm, Searchable Columns, Keys, and Column Values Some nistbladm operations require that you enter a column=value pair for every column in the table. Note - address=129.146.168.120.,name=regulus,dnsmaster address=129.146.168.120 or But notice in the table above that the machine regulus is multi-homed and has two IP addresses. In that case, the column=value of host=regulus identifies two rows. To identify just the first regulus row, you would enter either: name=altair,address=129.146.168.4. address=129.146.168.4 name=altair In this",
