            "Fun things to do? It's Philadelphia. There is always something to do. Drexel also runs fun events, and there a lot of intramural sports.",
            "There are a lot of options on campus, especially the food trucks. The school has a cafeteria but it is not the best quality food. Some people have gotten really sick from it until they get used to the food.",
            "I commute to school so I am not entirely familiar with the dorming situation. However, I have stayed over for a few nights and I did enjoy the time there.",
            "The course load is heavy, especially for engineering students. Drexel packs 15 weeks of material into 10 weeks. As you can expect, time management is key to success at Drexel.",
            "Drexel is very, very expensive, so look into all of your choices. Although it may be a good college, saving money is just as smart of a decision.",
            "Drexel University is a very good and well respected university. The main perk of attending is the excellent coop program. Drexel is very good at preparing students for the real so world."

A group tour might be ok if you want to see the campus, but not if you want to try to get to know the campus. Plus, a student will be able to give you a more personal insight into their experiences. With all of that in mind, be aware that the way Drexel operates is in terms or a quarter system. The average college has two semesters of around 14 or 16 weeks and a summer break. Drexel's freshman year consists of three 10 week terms equal to that of a semester and summer term off. The credits you earn on the quarter system are sometimes looked as unequal to those on a semester system by other colleges, so if you ever want to transfer it might be very difficult to do. The workload is very intense being 10 weeks as opposed to 16. Also, Drexel starts and ends later than most colleges. Drexel begins Fall term near the end of September, and Spring term ends around the second week of June, much like most high schools. Good luck on your searching!, 2340=Right now, I am on summer vacation. I cannot wait to go back to Drexel in September. Drexel's campus is filled with fun clubs, organizations, and there's always something to do. If you tire of being on campus, the heart and soul of Philadelphia, Center City, is a short, (free) shuttle ride away., 136741=File FAFSA in January, and you will automatically get $1000 in aid from Drexel., 591407=The top floor of our main buildings has this one room that surely hasn't been touched since 1980. There's all this old tech stuff forgotten up there, which is cool to see. I always want to explore that floor more, I have a feeling there's alot more history to be found., 379117=Not so much on campus but Philadelphia has the Mummer's parade every New Year's and has a great Welcome America for fourth of July., 821129=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 747539=If you're up for the challenge, the opportunities are here at Drexel. If your interested in research, check out the STAR program for incoming freshmen. It's a paid summer internship with housing. For anyone considering attending Drexel, I would contact the department you would be considering for your major. I set up an appointment with the Electrical Engineering department when I went on the campus tour. I met with a professor and an adviser, they were great. They explained how the program worked, spoke about Drexel in general and answered all the questions my parents and I had . They gave us contact information that we used later for followup questions via email and telephone. Checkout the COOP program,COOP is what makes Drexel different. Freshman year started in 9/2012, all freshman are required to take classes to prepare for COOP. In 12/2013 I interviewed with 4 companies, got job offers from 3 and just started(3/31/14) a 6 month full-time position with SAP Solutions (the 4th largest software company in the world). It's an unbelievable opportunity. Even more unbelievable is that I get paid (I think alot), they offered me benefits, health insurance, 401K. I'm excited to learn and contribute. The other tip is something I heard from student at every school I looked at. GET INVOLVED and do it right away... club, sports, Greek life, work study job, student government, newspaper, pep band, anything.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Hard-working, self-motivated, involved, those who like a challenge, leaders, those who like the city, and those who want to learn the most they can so they can go out in the working world and be successful. Tips for prospective students In high school, work hard and get involved. Drexel University is looking for students with good grades and those that take leadership roles. If you get accepted into Drexel, I suggest to take advantage of the 5 year program, which gives you the most working experience. If you are stressed out about the price of the school and you live within commuting distance, don't be afraid to commute. I am a commuter and I feel that I still get the college experience while saving a lot of money. Bang for the buck The reason I give Drexel five stars in this category is that it offers the Co-Op program. It's an opportunity anyone should took take advantage of. It enables you to get yourself into the working world and helps you to boost your resume. Students can work with top companies in different parts of the world as well as here in the U.S. Am enjoying being here",
