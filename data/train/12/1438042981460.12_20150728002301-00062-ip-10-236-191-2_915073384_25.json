            "Security can always be seen on campus around in their golf carts. The library constantly has at least 2 security guards.",
            "Not very many clubs are offered. Only two clubs are adequately maintained: International Club and Anime Club.",
            "The community college environment is good for students who find difficulty focusing or understanding in lecture classes where active participation isn't required or acknowledged. Because students are allowed to discuss material with professors more frequently and in a less formal tone often times it's easier to understand for some students.",
            "As a community college the courses offered are cheap, so students can experiment in different courses without worrying about financial repercussions.",
            "The food offered at KCC is provided by students in the culinary courses and at times the dining can be pretty tasty, however selection is limited and the food eventually becomes repetitive.",
            "No dorms are available.",
            "Some classes can be difficult, but that is an inevitability when it comes to more rigorous courses like Business Law and Computer Science III. Elective classes often times are rather easy if students actively participate in their own learning by taking notes and asking questions.",
            "Students should be prepared to be engaged by the professors. Interaction between student and professor is almost essential to the learning experience for many of the courses offered.",
            "Contrary to popular belief, community colleges like Kapiolani Community College (KCC) offers a worthwhile education. The college provides educational quality almost identical to that of a 4-year university, however the experience is rather different. KCC provides a more interactive, close environment rather than the distance that lecture hall classes such as those in a university."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Most definitely getting the most bang for my buck. The school is really good about providing financial aid to students who need and deserve it, especially during these tough economical times. Plus, the classes I am taking are general education requirements which are equivalent to those at the University of Hawaii, but I am paying WAY less. DEFINTELY getting the most bang for my buck at KCC!!! Am enjoying being here It's kind of hard to make friends if you don't already have any going in, but people are really nice and teachers are very helpful. The smaller class sizes are more intimate, making for a better learning environment where the professors actually know who you are! Am learning a lot The teachers at KCC emphasize LEARNING, not just memorizing information for tests. They want us to obtain skills that will help us in the work force (knowing that force equals mass times acceleration is NOT one of those skills). They teach students how to think critically; they teach students how to be open-minded and understanding; they teach students how to learn. It's the level of thinking that matters, and I'm glad that KCC is teaching me how to reach higher levels of thinking, and is not",
