    "textAfterTable": "More >> Conduct Research Top Ultrasonic Leak Detectors Ultrasonic leak detectors also called sonic or choked flow detectors are the most widely recognized source of ultrasonic vibrations. The turbulent flow of a fluid across a pressure boundary creates acoustic waves that the ultrasonic leak detector picks up. These waves can be transmitted through Pyroelectric Detectors , the crystal is heated and causes the dipole moment to change. The changing of this dipole moment causes a current to flow. When using pyroelectrics, care must be taken not to exceed the maximum pulse width or the maximum repetition rate. Basic Principles of Silicon Detectors an electron from the valence to the conduction band, is incident upon the detector, the resulting accumulation of charge leads to a flow of current in an attached circuit. Since light is not the only source of energy that can excite an electron, detectors will produce some amount of current Detector Tube Measurements from Pressurized Systems can increase the flow rate through the tube dramatically over that of the factory calibration conditions. This can cause the tube to overstate or read high, due to the reduced contact time between the target gas",
