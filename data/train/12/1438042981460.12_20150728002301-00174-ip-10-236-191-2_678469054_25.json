I'll update in due course., 310699=Posted by Lucas at 02:14 PM, 296620=(Statistics are through May 31. Yeah, I'm late.), 242290=Posted by Lucas at 12:25 PM, 277932=Posted by Lucas at 06:04 PM, 66884=Posted by Lucas at 09:39 AM, 296395=Posted by Lucas at 05:09 PM, 76342=On a macro level, the Texas offense strongly resembles 2004 and 2006: high on homers, low on OBP, unexceptional overall. However, some recent high-scoring games have papered over a horrible April and the fact that Texas has scored five or more runs per game 10% less often than last year (43% vs 53%). Texas may have the best offense in the division, but surely it deserves no praise., 151324=The Rangers lead the division as they did after April. Recent issues with run scoring (4.25 runs per game over the last twelve) have pulled them down to seventh in the AL in runs scored, below average once accounting for park. Texas does have an OPS+ of 103, so they've scored fewer runs than their line of .278/.348/.457 would suggest. Observe Seattle's hacktastic walk rate of 6%; the Mariners trail even the pitiful Royals in bases on balls., 310105=Los Angeles has had the best pitching in the division, though again, they've also had the best luck. A solid rotation and tremendous top three in the bullpen should keep them in contention no matter what the offense does. Texas amazingly has surrendered the lowest slugging percentage in the division. Oakland hasn't pitched terribly in the aggregate, but bullpen acquisitions Juan Cruz and Kiko Calero have cratered, and closer Octavio Dotel won't even be trade bait after electing to have elbow surgery. Seattle had a terrible rotation in 2004 and has done nothing to improve it., 33647=But in the year 2011, the Angels will be paying 36-year-old Gary Matthews (career OBP+: 99) and 35-year-old Torii Hunter (career OBP+: 96) a combined $25 million (barring a trade or other event)., 277676=Inconceivable though it may seem, the 2004 pitching staff offered the fourth-best performance in the American League and also the fourth-best in Ranger history in terms of ERA+. I swear it is true. In 2005, they're not quite average., 217037=AL West on June 1:, 281135=Division-leading Los Angeles set a franchise record with 51 wins after 81 games. As is often the case, they've won more games than their peripherals would suggest. Oakland has risen from the dead to reach the outskirts of the division race. Texas is playing better than the 2004 squad in some respects, while Seattle isn't quite bad enough to be interesting., 25574=Posted by Lucas at 02:09 PM, 2057=Posted by Lucas at 12:11 PM, 86659=Texas ranks no higher than 11th in the AL in any \u201c+\u201d stat for pitching. Last year, the Rangers surrendered plenty of hits but kept walks and homers to acceptable levels. In 2007, on a team level, Texas has does nothing well from the mound. The Rangers no longer lead the league in unearned runs allowed. Thanks, Kansas City!, 267999=Texas is only three games off their 46-35 record from one year ago. I have to confess the margin feels larger, perhaps because last year's success was so unexpected and 2005's June was a trainwreck. Texas did everything \"right\" in 2004, finishing sixteen games over .500 despite middling peripherals. This year, their record reflects a pretty good squad but none of last year's good luck., 303366=Texas is the class of the division. Put another way, the rest of the division is an embarrassment. LA has drawn far fewer walks than any team in the league. Their average-driven strategy works fine when they hit .280; when they hit .250, they have little to offer. Seattle has to be sorely disappointed in their minimal improvement from 2004 given the additions of Beltre and Sexson. Beltre's struggles and gaping holes at short and catcher have kept them down. Oakland's 77 OPS+ is a function of everyone hitting terribly simultaneously. That said, they won't be a good team at the plate even if Eric Chavez and Jason Kendall wake up. Note: \"Net steals per game\" = ( steals - caught stealing*2 ) / games played., 32990=Posted by Lucas at 01:11 PM, 65221=Posted by Lucas at 03:26 PM, 106622=Posted by Lucas at 08:33 PM, 116446=Texas and Oakland meet up again on August 7th. Both teams have ferocious schedules until then, while LA gets to coast:, 271125=In 2004, the allegedly powerful Ranger offense was largely a mirage based on park effects. They slugged with abandon but didn't reach base enough, finishing .011 below the park-adjusted league average for OBP. (Incidentally, I despise complaints like \"Texas is over-reliant on the home run,\" as if the team could somehow hit too many home runs. Perhaps the issue is semantic, but such statements place the blame on what Texas does well instead of where they're lacking. Instead, say \"Texas doesn't hit enough for average or draw enough walks.\") So far in 2005, run-scoring is down about one-quarter run per game league-wide, and The Ballpark has played less hitter-friendly than during 2002-2004. Thus, Texas's seemingly insignificant increase of 0.12 runs per game is really quite an accomplishment., 33891=Posted by Lucas at 02:39 AM, 2297=Here's a list of every truly homegrown starting pitcher in the wildcard-era AL West. By that I mean: pitching for the team that originally drafted or signed him, ineligible for free agency, and reaching 162 innings (or 1 IP per game in 1994-1995). So, for example, Rick Helling doesn't count because Texas traded and reacquired him prior to his four consecutive 200-inning seasons, and Felix Hernandez drops off after 2011 even though he remained an M because he'd reached six years of MLB service. Each season's division winner is colored., 217569=I was out of town most of the week, so here's the statistical roundup for the West through August 5th., 242091=I decided that one-year park factors were too volatile (the Texas factor was actually pitcher-friendly until June, when the temperature shot up). These are factors from 2004 to present., 101336=Posted by Lucas at 12:00 PM, 151782=Texas has an ERA+ of 106. As in 2004, the Rangers are winning more with pitching and defense than hitting. The key is a remarkably stingy 51 homers allowed, nine fewer than any West opponent and third fewest in the league. Texas trails only the Yankees in park-adjusted slugging percentage allowed. The rotation has held strong while the bullpen has regained respectability after a rough start., 276953=Likewise, because of a friendlier home park and lower scoring nation-wide, allowing 0.06 fewer runs per game is not cause for celebration. The Ballpark had a park-adjusted league-average ERA of over 5.00 in 2004. This year so far, it's only 4.34. Depressingly, the rotation on the whole has performed no better than the seventeen-man 2004 version. Texas has Kenny Rogers, Chris Young, and a month of Ricardo Rodriguez. The rest: a beehive swarming with earned runs. Worse still, the bullpen that made Texas a winner in 2004 has collapsed in injury and ineffectiveness. The retooled crew has performed much better of late, but Texas can't hope to fully overcome the loss of Frank Francisco and Carlos Almanzar., 216821=Posted by Lucas at 06:29 PM, 26206=LA's run of 68 wins in 104 games equaled a franchise best set during late 2006 through the middle of 2007., 26324=As for the Rangers... well, over the course of 38 years, they've never gone 68-36. Their best effort in a single season was a 65-49 in 1999, their last division-winning season. During the back half of 1977 and into '78, they went 67-37., 183710=Posted by Lucas at 11:29 AM, 217190=AL West since June 1:, 266206=2005 versus 2004, 26942=Posted by Lucas at 11:12 AM, 286245=Unlike last year's park-driven effort, the 2005 Ranger offense really is good and easily the class of the division. Anaheim batted .308 in June to build a seven-game lead, but no other team relies so heavily on base hits. If they bat .260 and tally a few fewer hits with runners on base, they'll suffer greatly. One can hope. Oakland was sporting an OPS+ of about 80 six weeks ago; a solid June has propelled them from historic wretchedness to ordinary wretchedness. Even considering Safeco-diminished expectations, the Mariners don't reach base or hit or power., 118418=Posted by Lucas at 10:13 AM, 25356=Sleater-Kinney, \"Not What You Want,\" from Dig Me Out, 1997, 9404=Posted by Lucas at 01:23 AM, 113694=Posted by Lucas at 01:14 AM, 151077=Posted by Lucas at 08:04 PM}",

    "textBeforeTable": "About the statistics: You're probably familiar with Baseball Reference's statistics OPS+ and ERA+. The \"+\" denotes conversion of the statistic to an index that is adjusted for each team's league and park. A score of 100 equates to an average performance in the particular statistic. For example, Texas plays in a hitter-friendly park and must score 5.1 runs per game to \u201cbreak even.\ufffd? Los Angeles, in a very pitcher-friendly park, has a break-even rate of about 4.8 runs per game. One can, if one is a nerd, use this indexing for any statistic: runs scored (RS+), runs allowed (RA+), on-base percentage, triples, and so on. Texas and the Yankees are tied for fewest homers allowed in the AL. On the downside, only Baltimore and Kansas City have a lower ERA+ among starting rotations. LA ranks third in ERA but only ninth in runs allowed thanks to 58 unearned runs. Only three AL teams have fewer homers than Texas. The Rangers\u2019 love of doubles (on pace for 393) has balanced the lack of long balls and kept their slugging percentage in the league\u2019s midrange. Remarkably, the division\u2019s best slugging team relative to home park is the usually basement-dwelling Seattle Mariners. Texas creeps past the halfway point as a nearly perfectly average ballclub: a 42-41 record, a park-adjusted index of 100 in runs scored, 99 in runs allowed, a team OPS+ of 101, and an OPS+ allowed of 100. The AL outscored the NL by a ridiculous 221 runs in",
