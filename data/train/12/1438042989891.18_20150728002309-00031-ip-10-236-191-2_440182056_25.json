            "GRAPHIC NOTIFICATION FEEDBACK FOR INDICATING INDUCTIVE COUPLING AMONGST DEVICES - A computing device is operated to detect a signal generated from an inductive signal interface. The detected signal may be generated by the device's inductive signal interface being in operational proximity to an inductive signal interface of another device. A notification feedback is generated that confirms an event related to the first and second computing device inductively signaling one another."

In certain embodiments, the PEG attaches to only one CPS, forming a decorated CPS. In other embodiments, bi-functional PEG molecules are attached to adjacent CPSs, thereby forming a covalently cross-linked composition. Additional embodiments include PEG/CMC compositions where the PEG is a multi-branch PEG and/or a multi-arm PEG. PEG/CMC compositions can be made with desired viscoelastic properties, and such compositions can be used as space-filling materials, load-bearing materials, anti-adhesion compositions, drug delivery vehicles or lubrication of tissues and medical instruments. 20140309315 05-24-2012 CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL COMPOSITIONS FOR MEDICAL USES - Compositions comprising carboxypolysaccharides (CPS) including carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are provided where the PEG is a PEG-epoxide covalently linked to the CPS.

View, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20080272907 METHOD FOR INTEGRATING USER NOTIFICATIONS AND USER ALERTS ON AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE - An interface for integrating and presenting user notifications and alerts consistently on an electronic device such as a mobile device is disclosed. First, an application programming interface provides the segregation to multiple preselected levels of priority notifications and alerts from all applications on the mobile device. Second, the application programming interface provides for the ability to display the notifications and alerts in a consistent manner for the user to handle. 11-06-2008 20080276170 SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING AND ARRANGING STATUS GADGETS IN A SMALL DISPLAY AREA - A system and method for persistently providing at least one status notification regarding a device component or application on an electronic system or device is provided. A selectable status notification icon (status gadget) is assigned for each of a number of applications and/or components for which status is monitored, each status notification icon reflecting changes in the monitored status. The status gadgets are persistently displayed in a user interface on the display screen of the electronic system or device. A contextual dialog is also displayed when a status gadget is selected. 11-06-2008 Scott C.
