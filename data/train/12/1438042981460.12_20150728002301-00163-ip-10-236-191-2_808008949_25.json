STRATEGIES   The queue manager implements a variety of strategies for either opening queue files (input) or for message delivery (output). Tag Description leaky bucket This strategy limits the number of messages in the active queue and prevents the queue manager from running out of memory under heavy load. fairness When the active queue has room, the queue manager takes one message from the incoming queue and one from the deferred queue. This prevents a large mail backlog from blocking the delivery of new mail. slow start This strategy eliminates \"thundering herd\" problems by slowly adjusting the number of parallel deliveries to the same destination. round The queue",
