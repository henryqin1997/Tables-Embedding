            "There are cameras on top of buildings that can monitor a student's activity on the main pathway of campus. Public Safety is also very responsive and there is taxi service where there is the option to be escorted on campus.",
            "A good majority of students are in Greek Life(~50%). However, there are no Greek Houses on campus.",
            "Too many! There is bound to be one for every type of student.",
            "Students looking for a small school or is pursuing graduate education in Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Law, Business, or nursing. Also great for students wanting to",
            "Definitely Bang for the buck. Most people receive scholarships to cut down the cost or they receive a loan. There are also many programs the University puts on that is free for students.",
            "The old market, parties, cheer on athletics.",
            "Food can get boring at the dining hall but there are many other options for dinner that food does not get that boring.",
            "Dorm Life is a great way to meet many people. Dorms for freshman and sophomores are good enough. Most students do not spend much time in their room.",
            "With the right professor you will do fine. Even with the more challenging professors they will help you out. There is always tutoring as well. A 3.0 in the Arts and Sciences should be manageable.",
            "Apply early because Creighton accepts students on rolling admission meaning the earlier you apply, the higher the chance you have of getting in.",
            "A great school with great people. Small but big enough. Go Jays!"

Soccer is huge here., 5464=If you are looking for a great-quality school in a homely city, then consider applying at Creighton University. Established as a Jesuit center of learning in 1878 in Omaha, Nebraska, the institution has done so much for its students. Not only does Creighton offer a great variety of liberal arts as well as pre-professional and professional classes, which are taught by the professors and not the teaching assistants, but it works very hard to provide an education that is as affordable as is possible. For example, because of this year's recession, the tuition is increasing by the smallest factor ever (almost all colleges raise the tuition yearly), and this fall has enrolled the most freshman that has ever been there. So, for those of you who find Creighton University appealing, get all the information you can about the school. Then, come visit the campus to step into the shoes of its students as they enjoy their college life mentally, physically, and spiritually., 206444=I have never felt unsafe on campus. I don't even feel uncomfortable crossing campus at 12:30 in the morning., 177244=W.A.C.: Wednesday After Class! Every wednesday from about 12-2:30 they have music playing and generally food or some fun craft on the mall! It definitely helps get through wednesdays!, 62912=Take the ACT test towards the end of your Junior Year. Also make sure you study for it. Apply earlier than December to reduce the stress of getting things in before the deadlines. Go to CU Sundays, and also make a personal college visit so that you can get all of your questions answered by the professors in the field of study you want to go into., 290951=When I enrolled at Creighton as a freshman in 2011, it was everything I had ever wanted. Its Jesuit values, academics, and extracurriculars are impressive, to say the least. Nowadays, I see it somewhat less rose-colored, but I in no way regret coming here or the four years past., 293539=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students I would say that CU is a great place for any type of student! There are so many activities, majors, groups, etc. that anyone could find a place here in the CU family! Tips for prospective students Going to class is very important, also stay organized and don't fall behind! But feel free to ask as many questions as you need!! Bang for the buck Its definitely a costly college, but CU does its best to help out families. They have many options as well as scholarships. To keep it short, if you want to attend, and cost is the obstacle, they'll definitely find a way to help you out! Am enjoying being here CU is definitely a fun place to be! Everyone around is enjoyable and welcoming! Even older students are willing to help the new recruits! Fun, safe, and clean campus! Am learning a lot There is definitely loads to learn while attending CU. Many of the professors keep class moving relatively fast so its very important to stay organized and not to trail behind! The professors are very nice",
