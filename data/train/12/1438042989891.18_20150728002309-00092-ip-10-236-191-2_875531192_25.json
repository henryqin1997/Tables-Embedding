    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{43805=A comparatively more satisfactory treatment of classical natural deduction in terms of introduction and elimination rules alone was first proposed by Parigot in 1992 in the form of a classical lambda calculus called \u03bb\u03bc. The key insight of his approach was to replace a truth-centric judgment A true with a more classical notion, reminiscent of the sequent calculus: in localised form, instead of \u0393 \u22a2 A, he used \u0393 \u22a2 \u0394, with \u0394 a collection of propositions similar to \u0393. \u0393 was treated as a conjunction, and \u0394 as a disjunction. This structure is essentially lifted directly from classical sequent calculi, but the innovation in \u03bb\u03bc was to give a computational meaning to classical natural deduction proofs in terms of a callcc or a throw/catch mechanism seen in LISP and its descendants. (See also: first class control.), 35795=The sequent calculus is the chief alternative to natural deduction as a foundation of mathematical logic. In natural deduction the flow of information is bi-directional: elimination rules flow information downwards by deconstruction, and introduction rules flow information upwards by assembly. Thus, a natural deduction proof does not have a purely bottom-up or top-down reading, making it unsuitable for automation in proof search. To address this fact, Gentzen in 1935 proposed his sequent calculus, though he initially intended it as a technical device for clarifying the consistency of predicate logic. Kleene, in his seminal 1952 book Introduction to Metamathematics, gave the first formulation of the sequent calculus in the modern style.[10], 70734=These notions correspond exactly to \u03b2-reduction (beta reduction) and \u03b7-conversion (eta conversion) in the lambda calculus, using the Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism. By local completeness, we see that every derivation can be converted to an equivalent derivation where the principal connective is introduced. In fact, if the entire derivation obeys this ordering of eliminations followed by introductions, then it is said to be normal. In a normal derivation all eliminations happen above introductions. In most logics, every derivation has an equivalent normal derivation, called a normal form. The existence of normal forms is generally hard to prove using natural deduction alone, though such accounts do exist in the literature, most notably by Dag Prawitz in 1961.[7] It is much easier to show this indirectly by means of a cut-free sequent calculus presentation., 93735=Natural deduction in its modern form was independently proposed by the German mathematician Gentzen in 1934, in a dissertation delivered to the faculty of mathematical sciences of the University of G\u00f6ttingen.[2] The term natural deduction (or rather, its German equivalent nat\u00fcrliches Schlie\u00dfen) was coined in that paper:, 92661=Gentzen was motivated by a desire to establish the consistency of number theory. He was unable to prove the main result required for the consistency result, the cut elimination theorem \u2014 the Hauptsatz \u2014 directly for Natural Deduction. For this reason he introduced his alternative system, the sequent calculus, for which he proved the Hauptsatz both for classical and intuitionistic logic. In a series of seminars in 1961 and 1962 Prawitz gave a comprehensive summary of natural deduction calculi, and transported much of Gentzen's work with sequent calculi into the natural deduction framework. His 1965 monograph Natural deduction: a proof-theoretical study[4] was to become a reference work on natural deduction, and included applications for modal and second-order logic., 95487=Natural deduction grew out of a context of dissatisfaction with the axiomatizations of deductive reasoning common to the systems of Hilbert, Frege, and Russell (see, e.g., Hilbert system). Such axiomatizations were most famously used by Russell and Whitehead in their mathematical treatise Principia Mathematica. Spurred on by a series of seminars in Poland in 1926 by \u0141ukasiewicz that advocated a more natural treatment of logic, Ja\u015bkowski made the earliest attempts at defining a more natural deduction, first in 1929 using a diagrammatic notation, and later updating his proposal in a sequence of papers in 1934 and 1935.[1] His proposals led to different notations such as Fitch-style calculus (or Fitch's diagrams) or Suppes' method of which e.g. Lemmon gave a variant called system L., 42255=Another important extension was for modal and other logics that need more than just the basic judgment of truth. These were first described, for the alethic modal logics S4 and S5, in a natural deduction style by Prawitz in 1965,[4] and have since accumulated a large body of related work. To give a simple example, the modal logic S4 requires one new judgment, \"A valid\", that is categorical with respect to truth:}",

    "textBeforeTable": "A theory is said to be consistent if falsehood is not provable (from no assumptions) and is complete if every theorem is provable using the inference rules of the logic. These are statements about the entire logic, and are usually tied to some notion of a model. However, there are local notions of consistency and completeness that are purely syntactic checks on the inference rules, and require no appeals to models. The first of these is local consistency, also known as local reducibility, which says that any derivation containing an introduction of a connective followed immediately by its elimination can be turned into an equivalent derivation without this detour. It is a check on the strength of elimination rules: they must not be so strong that they include knowledge not already contained in its premises. As an example, consider conjunctions. Consistency, completeness, and normal forms[edit] The introduction rule discharges both the name of the hypothesis u, and the succedent p, i.e., the proposition p must not occur in the conclusion A. Since these rules are schematic, the interpretation of the introduction rule is: if from \"A true\" we can derive for every proposition p that \"p true\", then A must be false, i.e., \"not A true\". For the elimination, if both A and not A are shown to be true, then there is a contradiction, in which case every proposition",
