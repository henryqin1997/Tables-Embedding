Children begin school in September in the year in which they are five, initially for mornings only. They start in one of the three parallel Reception classes which form part of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). This year group is referred to as FS2 by the school. The overwhelming majority of pupils have attended some kind of pre-school setting, many at the private group which meets on the school site.\", 74847=\"This large school includes a special resource unit to support pupils with multiple learning difficulties and/or disabilities.

The number of pupils who join or leave the school during each academic year is higher than average.

The headteacher has been in post since April 2010, and several new teachers have been appointed in the last year. Several members of the governing body are recent appointments.

The proportion of pupils with a statement of special educational needs is high largely because the school has two special provisions, one for deaf pupils, and one for pupils with learning difficulties and disabilities.
