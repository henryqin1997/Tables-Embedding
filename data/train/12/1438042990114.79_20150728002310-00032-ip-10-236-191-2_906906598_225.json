            "Howard is known for it's numerous parties around the campus and is known for both it's high end parties as well as it's house parties. Those who don't like to party can also go about the city to U Street, catch the Metro to Chinatown or catch the bus to Georgetown.",
            "The food options around campus are improving, but they are still limited in number and quality on campus. Currently, the Caf\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a9 of the Caf is the central hub of dining activity. It is used mainly by freshman students and those who have a meal plan. Upperclassmen typically go the Punchout which is opposite of the Caf in the Blackburn Center. The Punchout is a place where there are fast food options for students which are great for those with tight schedules and need to grab a bite to eat. There is a restaurant in the upper level of the Blackburn center in addition to a coffee stand in the administration building.",
            "While Howard's dorms are not entirely modern or state of the art. There is a culture that Howard dorms create by themselves. In each dorm there is a brother or sisterhood created, particularly in the freshman dorms such as Drew, The Tubman Quad, The Annex, and Carver. These dorms usually compete in a competition annually called ResFest which materializes the fun rivalries between the dorms and allows a nice distraction from the academic push during the latter half of the academic year.",
            "Howard is an institution where academic programs are rigorous based on the major. Science, business, and engineering, or mathematics majors usually tend to have the most difficult classes while those in Fine Arts are evaluated comprehensively. Health majors also share the burden of science majors in certain classes as well.",
            "New students should come with an expectation to work hard in and out of the classroom. Success here is not dependent solely on your GPA, but how you engage the opportunities that are abundant here. You should work hard to make sure that you prepare yourself for the world that the university introduces yourself to. Branch out and do not limit yourself to the bounds of the main campus, it will be highly rewarding if you do this as Washington D.C is rich in opportunities by itself.",
            "Howard University is an institution where real life meets an academic experience. For you to completely gain the experience you must arrive with an open mind along with a willingness to learn. The social scene also great allowing many networking opportunities that are not offered elsewhere."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{279349=Howard University is know for its epic Homecoming Celebrations. The biggest celebrities, music artist, stylist and experts from around the world travel to DC to help us celebrate our Homecoming festivities in style with a week filled with traditional events such as the Gospel Show, Comedy Show, Fashion Show and ultimately the Greek Step Show and most importantly Football Game. Homecoming is in mid to late October every year! Resfest, a competition between all the dormitories is the next biggest event and tradition at Howard, after Homecoming. Teams are formed from each dormitory to compete in Debate, Sports, Strolling, Dancing and most importantly Stepping for the Resfest Champion Title., 637148=This only got two stars because of the social aspect (and there is supposed to be more dorms built within the next 10 years). Our dorms need major reparations. In order to get the best experience I advise freshman girls to live in the Quad or the Annex, freshman boys should live in Drew Hall. DO NOT live in Meridian Hill Hall, it is a sophomore dorm and will deprive you from your freshman experience because it is a sophomore dorm and it is off campus. If you get placed there, have your parents call and complain. In around February, you'll have to pay $200 if you want to live on campus the following year. There is also a dorm that is way off campus (about 30 minutes total from campus) called University Town Center in Hyattsville, MD. It is metro- accessible and if you are used to a full kitchen and living room, this is the place for you (I recommend sophomores and up)., 715738=Stay on financial information. Register for classes in April., 459026=The dorm bathrooms and hallways are cleaned everyday and all the dorms are in great shape! In Fall 2014 there will be two new dorms housing Freshman girls and Sophomores., 864142=Check your teachers on ratemyprofessor.com and if your not an early morning person stay away from 8:10 classes. It will only lead to missing class., 930308=From recent reports, the tuition has increased by a significant amount since 2012, and that is unfortunate. From my experience, Howard has not always appropriated its funds in the best way, with the majority of the money not being sewn back into the university. With that being said, although you will have at least one score to settle or obstacle created by administration in need of a major reconstruction, you will have the memories of Homecoming and your own personal Howard experience to look forward to. So, depends on how you look at it, it may be worth it., 183290=Be yourself, the rest will follow! Get involved, whatever you can get your hands on that you are good at, do it! Volunteer, join a team or club, anything. Just get involved. GO TO CLASS! Howard has a lot of distractions, you can not let the glamour and fun take you way from your main focus! Do not get caught up in the graduating on time, there is no such thing. If an opportunity presents itself for you to study abroad or do a co-op, DO IT! Even if it means adding a semester or 2. (however make sure you have the funds to cover all of your time) Go to everything 10-30 minutes early. No matter the event or class you will benefit greatly from being early (including the cafe line) Get all of your financial aid/registration started as early as possible. If FASA opens on January 1st @ 12:00am, be there to fill it out by January 1st 12:01am. Do NOT wait until the week something is due because issues always arise and you will want time to attend to it. Stay on top of financial aid office, they are not very organized at times, and they have a lot of students to handle. Unfortunately its not all about you. Go to teachers office hours, and go often!! It benefits greatly if the teacher knows who you are and sees that you are making an effort, plus its added learning time. Don't spend you whole time planing your life, that you for get to live You miss 100% of the shoots you don't take. Take risks!, 854135=Homecoming at Howard draws over 6,000 people every September. It is a two week long tradition that spawns multiple events with iconic people., 929403=Howard University is the founding home to the majority of the Divine Nine, so be prepared to see, hear, and experience tons of Black Fraternities and Sororities participating in various events like auctions and pageants in the Fall, and probates in the Spring. The biggest event on campus is Howard Homecoming, which happens typically every October. It is one of the biggest college homecoming weeks in the country. Be prepared for lots of celebrity sightings, parades, and shows. Past guests included: Chaka Khan, Tyrese, Pooch Hall, P. Diddy, Boris Kojoe,Taraji P. Henson, Wendy Raquel Robinson, and much more., 1115936=Student organizations often host parties during the school year.Dancing and socializing are definitely big, and most students do frequent a lot of hip-hop and dance clubs in the area, namely Love and Fur. Homecoming, which occurs every year in the third week of October, is a can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?t-miss event and has been known to draw hundreds of alumni and students from schools all over the country, especially other HBCUs. Even if you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?re not yet 21, you can still enjoy DC\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s nightlife., 633747=We are the Alpha chapter for most of the black greeks. There is First Fridays in The Punchout where we get to watch them stroll/ step. Also, in April there are the Probates. We have other greeks as well that focus on your major/ minor. They are all great for networking. *Discretion is key*}",

    "textAfterTable": "Brianna from Indianapolis, IN 12/22/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 71 out of 72 people found this review useful. 2 of 301 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Anyone who is open to many new opportunities and unforgettable experiences. Tips for prospective students Don't party too hard during your first semester. I know several people who will not be able to complete their education at Howard because they were the ones getting ready every Thursday/Friday/Saturday night for the club instead of studying. Also be aware of your surroundings. Travel in large groups during the night and use the shuttles as much as possible so you won't have to worry about walking back to the dorms all the way from the metro. When you're about to buy books for classes, ask upperclassmen and look around campus for flyers of people selling their books for cheaper than the bookstore prices. Join clubs and community service organizations to build up your experience for those future internships and jobs. Stay focused on your grades. It is, after all, the reason why you'll be here in the first place so",
