Mary Bennett nee Wheelock 1850 Killinick , her first husband was Thomas Bennett., 543300=13 July 1855, 163331=Sir - As to the manners and customs of our ancestors are sinking into oblivion, may I tresspass on your columns for the following account of a singular, and picturesque custom of burying their dead, observed by some families, of a respectable class of peasantry in this immediate neighbourhood, which custom here was confined solely, for at least a century back, to some families named Tracy, with their connections, Doyles, &c., and a family named Daly, in no way connected with the Tracy family. The grave being dug deep, stones were placed within the grave at each end, about 2\u00bd feet in height, the grave was then neatly lined with soil or grass scrolls of about 2\u00bd feet in width, and of sufficient length to extend from the surface to, and on the bottom of the grave, fastened to the bank with skewers of wood, next a bed of dry grass and moss was laid in the grave, raised at the head like a pillow - the corpse wrapped closely in a sheet, was carried on a broad plank to the grave, where being deposited on the bed of grass, the plank was laid over it, being supported at each end by the stones before mentioned, which kept it about 1\u00bd feet above the corpse; next, the upper part of the scrolls were unfastened from the side and carefully laid over the plank, the end scrolls in like manner. The grave was then filled up with earth, and covered with a scroll in the ordinary way. The last so buried thus was John Doyle, of craan, about the year 1818, in St. John's church yard, adjoining this town, the burying place of those families. The grave was prepared and the funeral conducted by the Tracys. Since then the younger branches of the family, having the conducting of funerals, have fallen into the habits of their neighbours. Caoineing, or keening, was not customary at those funerals. Having been at funerals in remote districts of the south and west of Ireland, where the corpse was attended to the grave by caoiners (keeners), I never knew or heard then, of any family voluntarily burying their dead without coffins. Now, as we are a mixed race in this county, - the descendants of old Irish, Danes, Welsh, Anglo-Normans, &c., you, or any of your numerous readers, giving information, of the origin of the above custom will much oblige., 579324=8/12/1915 Discharged - Not being likely to become an efficient soldier., 653338=June 8th after a lingering illness borne with Christian fortitude and entire resignation, Eliza, third sister of the late?

I wrote to the Committee to suspend or dismiss her, and let Mrs M'Guirke act for the present in her place...Nurse Tracey should be discharged, we do so, and discharge her from further service in the Hospital subject to the Board on Saturday next..., 153350=One of the Tracys of Newburyport, Captain Thomas Tracy who left Ireland around 1766, did travel to Ireland in 1783 and visited his parents, but it is not completely certain that he was from Wexford.}",
