To create this motion typically a high voltage, high frequency electrical signal is supplied to a piezo-electric crystal stack. As the crystals are excited they expand and contract at the same rate as the excitation signal. The amplitude, or peak-to-peak travel distance, depends on the piezo stack Micro moves mechanism, typically a slide or flexure. The end of the Squiggle screw moves the lens mechanism with precise speed and micrometer resolution. The mechanism incorporates position sensing to produce controlled steps.
