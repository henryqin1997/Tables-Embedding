            "Theres a police station right across campus, they are mostly out on thursdays-sunday because that is of course when people party, the campus is pretty open, to the point where it feels like anyone can walk in...that is probably because they can....but always walk in groups at night...I never felt unsafe since its a small community around but you never know.....I think the campus only has 2 safety blue boxes as well from what I remember so if you're in trouble and a campus box is not near you and you didnt take my advance like I said about having a buddy with you then well......Goodluck Charlie...",
            "Yes...some national ones too I believe, I did not bother since I knew I would transfer but I had some friends in some and they had a good time",
            "This is the most important...If you dont get out of your dorm room then of course you will say it sucks, I got out of my dorm room alot with clubs and teams and I still think it sucked...but you know that until you get out and get involved !.....theres a bunch you can do, they have club day in the panthers den where you can go around and join clubs and get to know people...its really nice. I would recommend that for anyone, to at least try !",
            "If you really love really small schools, everyone knowing everything about you, 1 on 1 with professors, the deep country, and getting a bunch of text alerts from ferrum mail about pointless stuff like lost sweat pants....then this is your school! :D",
            "tradition was to always to go Virginia Tech and Radford....those schools are really close by like less than 30 minutes away...If you have friends at those schools you will probably see them alot....but only if you have a car...or know someone who has a car...My favorite place on campus was the library....I would spend most of my time there.",
            "NO...just NO....Its a private school so It will be the same, unless you can convince Ferrum to give you more money then I wouldnt....Ive talked to a bunch of people who have said 1 year they go completely free, then the next you really get hit with a hugeee tuition. So if you can go there for pretty much nothing ,GO ! I had lots of scholarships myself but the amount i had left to pay still was not worth it in my opinion...",
            "ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...........Go party at other colleges...thats what I did ! The parties at Ferrum are hit and miss and you pay to get in to most unless you have connections thru that frat or soro.....I was apart of clubs and I was active at Ferrum but it just was not for me....almost everyone I talked to transferred out....But it has to be one of those things you find out for yourself....the school could be for you ! you never know !",
            "Eh...most days were miss, The only time they had good food were when fancy people came...other than that I stayed at papa johns and subway the most...The cafe food just was not to my liking....Pappys should of catered Ferrum if you ask me...(Pappys was this guy that lived across from Ferrum, Alot of people were in his store all the time but I believe he shut down now sadly, his food was amazing !)",
            "EW....one of the main reasons I left...ANTS!!!! you are blessed if you get clarke or one of those nice ones but if you get any basement level room in one of the old dorms like sue west, chapman, riddick.... brace yourself for Ants. I had atleast 6 ants traps in my room....Does not matter if you leave food out or not...there are ants in the basement rooms. Try getting an upper one or a nice dorm..",
            "I have to give it to Ferrum even though I transferred out, Ferrum gave me the best English professors I have ever had, Mr.Greene and Dr. Macklin I believe were their names....I really enjoyed their classes the most...my other classes were pretty good too when it came to learning",
            "Have.....A....Car....Its essential, the only thing in walking distance are the dollar general and the DQ, other than that, you will be stuck, I had a car on campus and I still did not like it. The closest thing is an area called Rocky Mount which is about a 25 minute drive...most people go there to tan and go to walmart...that is about it...the real mall is in Roanoke, about an hour drive away from Ferrum",
            "Well, Ferrum is in the middle of no where...if you like the deep country then you will be just fine..."

Resident assistance is always available also. Clubs and Activities Ferrum does have a variety of Greek clubs, from national ones to local one too. There is an outdoor club for those who enjoy the outdoors. We also have a handful of sport teams and for those who don't want to be on an actual team we also have intramurals.
