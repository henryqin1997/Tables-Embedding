System Requirement This tutorial will guide you on how to prepare a development environment to start your work with GWT Framework. This tutorial will also teach you how to setup JDK, Tomcat and Eclipse on your machine before you setup GWT Framework: GWT - Environment Setup GWT also provides a GWT Hosted Web Browser which lets you run and execute your GWT applications in hosted mode, where your code runs as Java in the Java Virtual Machine without compiling to JavaScript. GWT UI building library : This part of GWT consists of many subparts which includes the actual UI components, RPC support, History management, and much more. JRE Emulation library : Google Web Toolkit includes a library that emulates a subset of the Java runtime library. The list includes java.lang, java.lang.annotation, java.math, java.io, java.sql, java.util and java.util.logging GWT Java to JavaScript compiler : This is the most important part of GWT which makes it a powerful tool for building RIAs. The GWT compiler is used to translate all the application code written in Java into JavaScript. The GWT framework can be divided into following three major parts: The GWT Components Not designer's friendly: GWT is not suitable for web designers who prefer using plain HTML with placeholders for inserting dynamic content at later point in time.

You will find instructions for installing JDK in downloaded files, follow the given instructions to install and configure the setup. Finally set PATH and JAVA_HOME environment variables to refer to the directory that contains java and javac, typically java_install_dir/bin and java_install_dir respectively. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the base directory location where Java is installed on your machine. For example OS Output Windows Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_21 Linux export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java-current Mac export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home Append Java compiler",
