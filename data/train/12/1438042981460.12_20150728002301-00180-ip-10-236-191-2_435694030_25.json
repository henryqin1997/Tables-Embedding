            "Naphthalene Derivatives as Termite Repellents and Toxicants - Several derivatives of naphthalene, including 1\u2032-acetonaphthone, 2\u2032-acetonaphthone, 1-methoxynaphthalene, and 2-methoxynaphthalene, were discovered to be effective toxicants and repellents of termites, and resulted in significant reduction in termite feeding activity. For example, 2\u2032-acetonaphthone was found to be an effective repellent and feeding deterrent of termites. Termites exposed to concentrations as low as 8 mg/kg sand exhibited a significant reduction in tunneling and feeding activity. Moreover, some of the dead termites had symptoms indicative of a failure to molt. At concentrations \u226720 \u03bcg/cm",
