We formed our Company for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties. On February 18, 2011, all of the mineral properties and related development and exploration activities were disposed of as part of a series of transactions resulting in the Company moving into the medical device industry. On February 18, 2011, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Organ Transport Systems, Inc. (\u201cOTS\u201d), a Nevada corporation, and simultaneously disposed of the assets relating to its former activities in mining exploration, along with all related liabilities. Consequently, OTS was then considered to be the surviving entity, with the Company including only the financial results of OTS in our financial statements. In March, 2012, however, the Company determined that the development costs and time to development for the OTS technology were significantly greater than originally expected and that there were other, unexpected issues and concerns relating to the acquisition. As a result, we determined to reverse the acquisition and the transaction was rescinded by agreement., 79145=We have been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid\u00a0by a director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by a director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will (unless in the opinion of our counsel, the matter has been settled by controlling precedent) submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the question whether indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The legal process relating to this matter if it were to occur is likely to be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity, either\u00a0of which factors is likely to materially reduce the market and price for our shares, if such a market ever develops. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 203165=For the Periods from September 24, 1998 (Date of Inception), to August 31, 2012, 369992=Balance at August 31, 2011, 286849=The remaining shares due to be returned as of August 31, 2012 have been returned and have been retired., 177173=Cumulative from Inception to August 31, 2012, 357887=On May 8, 2012, the Company issued its promissory note in the amount of $20,000 to an unrelated third party for additional working capital. The note is due on February 8, 2013 and carried interest at 6 percent per annum, payable at maturity. The note is convertible into common stock of the Company after six months, at the election of the Holder, at 60 percent of the average of the three lowest closing bid prices of the common stock for the ten trading days prior to the date of the election to convert. The Note was fully outstanding at August 31, 2012., 381642=Effective November 7, 2012, the Company completed a reverse split of its common stock, resulting in the number of shares of common stock being reduced on the basis of one new common shares for each fifteen old common shares outstanding. \u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, as of November 7, 2012, there were 33,287,857 common shares issued and outstanding. The reverse stock split has been given retroactive recognition in this Form 10-K. \u00a0All shares and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split., 329252=On October 13, 2011, the Company issued 266,667, shares of common stock for services rendered under consulting agreements., 177671=August 31, 2012, 367759=As of August 31, 2012, the fair value of the Company\u2019s derivative liabilities was $30,815 and $130,452 was recognized as a gain on derivatives due to change in fair value of the liabilities during the year ended August 31, 2012., 436611=During the years ended, August 31, 2012 and 2011, we were billed by our then independent registered public accounting firm, Moss, Krusick and Associates, LLC approximately $48,500 and $51,300 for audit and review fees associated with our 10-K and 10-Q., 238859=Balance - August 31, 2012, 437699=During the years ended, August 31, 2012 and 2011, our independent registered public accounting firm, Moss, Krusick and Associates, LLC, did not perform any other work., 123368=We received loan proceeds of $35,000 in March 2012 from Asher Enterprises, LLC, an unrelated third party, due January 30, 2013 at 8 percent interest. The note is convertible into common stock at a price equal to 50 percent of the three lowest trading prices for our common stock for the ten trading days prior to the notice of conversion., 382645=On November 21, 2012, the Company acquired Burgoyne Internet Services, LLC, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. \u00a0The terms of the acquisition and pro forma financial statements for Burgoyne are included in the Current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 26, 2012., 391719=No change in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended August 31, 2012, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting., 412688=2012, 72087=We will incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these newly applicable rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs., 128143=The U.S. economy is currently in a recession, which could be long-term. Consumer confidence continued to deteriorate and unemployment figures continued to increase during 2012. However, in recent months, certain economic indicators have shown modest improvements. The generally deteriorating economic situation, together with the limited availability of debt and equity capital, including bank financing, will likely have a disproportionate impact on all micro-cap companies. As a result, we may not be able to execute our business plan due to our inability to raise sufficient capital and/or be able to develop a customer base for our planned products., 43510=We originally formed our Company for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties. On February 18, 2011, all of the mineral properties and related development and exploration activities were disposed of as part of a series of transactions resulting in the Company moving into the medical device industry.

As a result, we determined to reverse the acquisition and the transaction was rescinded by agreement., 383060=On November 27, 2012, the Company agreed to acquire La Casita de los Ni\u00f1os, LLC a California company doing business as Immersion House, and providing early language training in a full immersion program. \u00a0Details of the acquisition were reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 29, 2012. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 433792=Mr. Gelmon was awarded a total of 333,333 shares of common stock at the time he was retained as Chairman and CEO of the Company, with the shares vesting over 3 years on a proportionate basis. \u00a0As of August 31, 2012, two-thirds of the shares had vested and the balance has been issued but is held in escrow for release on July 1, 2013. \u00a0\u00a0On the original issue, Mr. Gelmon requested that a portion of the shares be issued to other named parties, as to which he disclaims any beneficial interest. \u00a0, 294230=The Company's financial statements are presented as those of a development stage enterprise through August 31, 2012.

Previous guidance under Topic 350 required an entity to test goodwill for impairment using a two-step process on at least an annual basis. First, the fair value of a reporting unit was calculated and compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Second, if the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, the amount of impairment loss, if any, was required to be measured. Under the amendments in this update, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads the entity to determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If the entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to test goodwill for impairment under the two-step process as described under paragraphs 350-20-35-4 and 350-20-35-9 under Topic 350. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and early adoption is permitted.
