            "howard's campus is in the heart of d.c., which is not a good neighborhood at all. the campus is open, which means it is not shut off and anyone can come on campus at anytime.",
            "howard is where greek life started. the organizations are filled with pride and are always displaying their talents.",
            "there are so many social groups and clubs to be involved in. these include clubs for almost every state, belief, interest and sports. our sporting events are extremely fun due to the large amount of school spirit howard students have.",
            "howard is great for cultured people and people who money is not an issue for. please understand: if money is an issue in any way, howard is not the place for you and you will have a constant stress on your shoulders.",
            "howard is an h.b.c.u., which means there are a wide variety of traditions that honor black people. these include singing the negro national anthem at sporting events and the greek life chanting and dancing any chance they get.",
            "the cost of howard university is huge, but it seems as if the school is always asking for more money. nothing is free, and what you pay for, is bad service from staff, mediocre food, and housing with constant issues.",
            "honestly, there is not much to do for fun at howard unless you have money to spend. most college students struggle with finances. and there are not a lot of free events or things to do at howard. if you have the means to venture out in dc, there are common city past-times such as movie theaters and shopping. parties are usually at clubs, which can cost over $20.",
            "the food served in the two cafeteria is bearable. nothing can compare to home, but there is always something that students can find enjoyable. the hours of operation of the only dining places on campus are very limited and inconvenient.",
            "housing is a huge pain. howard has more students then they can accommodate. therefore housing is not guaranteed. the dorms have many issues including frequent electrical outages, false fire alarms, and the lack of hot water.",
            "this varies depending on individual majors. there is always a way to get help when needed.",
            "i beg you all to apply for so many scholarships. howard is an extremely expensive school, and the staff could care less about their students if money is an issue. howard will not be an enjoyable experience if there is money that needs to be paid.",
            "howard has many negatives but is a great experience. i rate howard university on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being the best, a 7. a lot of the bad things about howard outweigh the good."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{279349=Howard University is know for its epic Homecoming Celebrations. The biggest celebrities, music artist, stylist and experts from around the world travel to DC to help us celebrate our Homecoming festivities in style with a week filled with traditional events such as the Gospel Show, Comedy Show, Fashion Show and ultimately the Greek Step Show and most importantly Football Game. Homecoming is in mid to late October every year! Resfest, a competition between all the dormitories is the next biggest event and tradition at Howard, after Homecoming. Teams are formed from each dormitory to compete in Debate, Sports, Strolling, Dancing and most importantly Stepping for the Resfest Champion Title., 637148=This only got two stars because of the social aspect (and there is supposed to be more dorms built within the next 10 years). Our dorms need major reparations. In order to get the best experience I advise freshman girls to live in the Quad or the Annex, freshman boys should live in Drew Hall. DO NOT live in Meridian Hill Hall, it is a sophomore dorm and will deprive you from your freshman experience because it is a sophomore dorm and it is off campus. If you get placed there, have your parents call and complain. In around February, you'll have to pay $200 if you want to live on campus the following year. There is also a dorm that is way off campus (about 30 minutes total from campus) called University Town Center in Hyattsville, MD. It is metro- accessible and if you are used to a full kitchen and living room, this is the place for you (I recommend sophomores and up)., 715738=Stay on financial information. Register for classes in April., 459026=The dorm bathrooms and hallways are cleaned everyday and all the dorms are in great shape! In Fall 2014 there will be two new dorms housing Freshman girls and Sophomores., 864142=Check your teachers on ratemyprofessor.com and if your not an early morning person stay away from 8:10 classes. It will only lead to missing class., 930308=From recent reports, the tuition has increased by a significant amount since 2012, and that is unfortunate. From my experience, Howard has not always appropriated its funds in the best way, with the majority of the money not being sewn back into the university. With that being said, although you will have at least one score to settle or obstacle created by administration in need of a major reconstruction, you will have the memories of Homecoming and your own personal Howard experience to look forward to. So, depends on how you look at it, it may be worth it., 183290=Be yourself, the rest will follow! Get involved, whatever you can get your hands on that you are good at, do it! Volunteer, join a team or club, anything. Just get involved. GO TO CLASS! Howard has a lot of distractions, you can not let the glamour and fun take you way from your main focus! Do not get caught up in the graduating on time, there is no such thing. If an opportunity presents itself for you to study abroad or do a co-op, DO IT! Even if it means adding a semester or 2. (however make sure you have the funds to cover all of your time) Go to everything 10-30 minutes early. No matter the event or class you will benefit greatly from being early (including the cafe line) Get all of your financial aid/registration started as early as possible. If FASA opens on January 1st @ 12:00am, be there to fill it out by January 1st 12:01am. Do NOT wait until the week something is due because issues always arise and you will want time to attend to it. Stay on top of financial aid office, they are not very organized at times, and they have a lot of students to handle. Unfortunately its not all about you. Go to teachers office hours, and go often!! It benefits greatly if the teacher knows who you are and sees that you are making an effort, plus its added learning time. Don't spend you whole time planing your life, that you for get to live You miss 100% of the shoots you don't take. Take risks!, 854135=Homecoming at Howard draws over 6,000 people every September. It is a two week long tradition that spawns multiple events with iconic people., 929403=Howard University is the founding home to the majority of the Divine Nine, so be prepared to see, hear, and experience tons of Black Fraternities and Sororities participating in various events like auctions and pageants in the Fall, and probates in the Spring. The biggest event on campus is Howard Homecoming, which happens typically every October. It is one of the biggest college homecoming weeks in the country. Be prepared for lots of celebrity sightings, parades, and shows. Past guests included: Chaka Khan, Tyrese, Pooch Hall, P. Diddy, Boris Kojoe,Taraji P. Henson, Wendy Raquel Robinson, and much more., 1115936=Student organizations often host parties during the school year.Dancing and socializing are definitely big, and most students do frequent a lot of hip-hop and dance clubs in the area, namely Love and Fur. Homecoming, which occurs every year in the third week of October, is a can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?t-miss event and has been known to draw hundreds of alumni and students from schools all over the country, especially other HBCUs. Even if you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?re not yet 21, you can still enjoy DC\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s nightlife., 633747=We are the Alpha chapter for most of the black greeks. There is First Fridays in The Punchout where we get to watch them stroll/ step. Also, in April there are the Probates. We have other greeks as well that focus on your major/ minor. They are all great for networking. *Discretion is key*}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Since I'm in the School of Business the curriculum proved to be challenging. I took 15 credit hours for my first semester freshman year and I could handle it. There are hundreds of classes to take and what's better is that you can choose what classes you want and which teacher which is a choice that I didn't have in high school. I've learned the most in my Business Orientation class about credit and how to invest money at an earlier age. During the first semester, the School of B students are put into teams where we are given different projects and presentations that we have to present to the class. These groups helped me learn how to work with others and how to formulate certain business ideas and how to market new products. Now that my first semester is over, I'm excited to see how much Howard will teach me in the coming years.
