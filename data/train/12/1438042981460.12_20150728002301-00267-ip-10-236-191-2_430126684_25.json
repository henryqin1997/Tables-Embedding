            "BELT DRIVE APPARATUS AND IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS - A belt drive apparatus, including, an endless belt to be laid across in a tensioned condition between supporting rollers and to travel being in pressure contact with or being separated from a body to receive the pressure contact, a pressure contact/separating state detection section to detect whether the endless belt is in the pressure contact with the body or separated therefrom, a belt position detection section to detect a position of the endless belt in a width direction thereof, a belt abnormality judging section to judge whether the endless belt is in an abnormal position based on a detection result obtained by the belt position detection section and one of judgment values which are set correspondingly to the pressure contact/separating state of the endless belt, and a belt drive control section to control a drive of the endless belt.",
            "FIXING DEVICE AND IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS - Disclosed is a fixing device including a fixing belt to fix a toner image formed on a paper onto the paper, a driving unit to make the fixing belt reciprocate in a direction perpendicular to a feeding direction of the paper when fixing the toner image onto the paper and a detecting unit to detect a position of the fixing belt in the perpendicular direction, and a control target value of the fixing belt is changed in accordance with the position of the fixing belt in the perpendicular direction detected by the detecting unit, and the fixing belt is made to reciprocate by the driving unit based on the changed control target value.",
            "IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS - When an input image is to be formed on a sheet conveyed to a transfer roller, the exposure section is controlled and deviation correction is performed to offset the image forming position across the width of the sheet in response to the result of detection by a deviation sensor. By contrast, when pattern images are to be formed on a sheet in response to the instruction of the main control section, the image forming control section does not perform deviation correction in the process of forming a pattern image.",
            "IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS - An image formation control section sets a secondary transfer section in the pressed state in the case of execution of a main scanning correction processing as color registration correction, and sets the secondary transfer section in the separated state in the case of execution of a sub-scanning correction processing, an entire lateral magnification correction processing, a partial lateral magnification correction processing, or a skew correction processing, which is the correction of the image position for components other than the main scanning direction as color registration correction so as to prevent the situation where the correction accuracy of the image position with respect to the main scanning direction decreases and to prevent a decrease in print quality due to a residual image of a registration correction processing."

The control apparatus increases a force of engagement of a clutch when an operating speed of an engine is lower than an operating speed of an electric motor after a collision, and reduces the force of engagement of the clutch when the operating speed of the engine is equal to or higher than the operating speed of the electric motor after the collision. Accordingly, the clutch is placed in an engaged state when the engine applies a load to the electric",
