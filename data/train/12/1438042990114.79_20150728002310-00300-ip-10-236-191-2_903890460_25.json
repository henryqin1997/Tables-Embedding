            "Free movie nights downtown are a big hit. We have live musicians downtown and on campus around all the time. Get out of your comfort zone! go downtown, meet people.",
            "I personally greatly enjoy the food here but a lot of students complain. Again, do not be too rigid in your ways, be willing to try new things. Not a good place for vegans though..",
            "They like to have everyone get along. Be prepared for hall competitions and lounge movie nights.",
            "Some classes are harder than others but overall the course work is easy. One on one time with a professor is impossible to avoid because the class sizes are so small.",
            "Be willing to see things from another persons point of view; being too rigid will make life here hell.",
            "Mary Baldwin is a great school for the students out there who didn't think that they could make it to college. The people here are diverse and accepting. You will meet people here from all walks of life."

Apple Eve there is a huge gathering in the gym, where each class plays dodge ball against each other and at the end there is a huge dance party. On Apple Day, students can choose to go pick apples for charity or they can sleep in. The dining hall cooks an amazing feast that puts Harry Potter feasts to shame and in the afternoon there is a carnival., 217857=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 42141=You get what you are paying for. Tuition pays for FIVE academic terms. Fall term, Spring term and May term. May term is an extra three week term that ends by the usual time other schools ends. You will take up to four credit classes and only take them for three weeks. Fun classes are given during this term. So in short, you get a lot of classes done. My Freshman year I finished 39 credit hours. This is considered a lot, but you have the opportunity to get a lot of classes done in a short time period., 110320=Clubs and activities are active and meet / occur often. There is always something to do at Baldwin (unless it's 1o'clock in the morning and you're just bored XD)., 83418=Mary Baldwin offers classes that area colleges don't offer. In the Spring of 2011 I was able to take a History of Furniture class for Art History. This is a class that you would not be able to take at any other college. Here you can expand your learning for the same price as any other class on campus., 51476=Tuition, room, and board for 2011-2012 totaled to $36,500 which is admittedly very expensive but MBC generally makes it worth the money., 67174=This is included in your tuition. Unfortunately, there are only two dining facilities on campus and no dining dollars for off-campus dining. Additionally, there are pretty limited closing hours (breakfast ends at 9:30, lunch at 1:30 and dinner at 7:30) and the food is cafeteria-style, no seconds until the last half hour of dining, and yes this is enforced. For the vegetarians,vegans, and people that eat halal/Kosher there are very limited pickings, though there is a salad bar that is always open. Dining services boasts in their healthy choices, but not in tasty ones...}",

There are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus and plenty of leadership chances. Am enjoying being here It is a very small town and campus but allows you to get to know people well.
