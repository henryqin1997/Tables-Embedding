If the caller chooses the End Call selection at state 344, the MDATA system 100 moves to a decision state 345. At decision state 345, the system 100 determines if process 254, process 256, or process 280 did not occur in Information mode. i.e., did occur in either Real mode or Pending Mode, and examines the patient's symbol table to determine if any of the configured memory variables are past medical history conditions that need to be saved to the patient's medical history file. If both conditions are true at state 345, the system 100 advances to a decision state 346 to determine if the consultation is being performed in Real mode. If not, the consultation is being performed in Pending mode. and the system 100 then writes any new patient information obtained during the consultation to the Pending file 269. If state 346 proves to be true, i.e., Real mode, for each past medical condition that needs to be saved, the MDATA system 100 asks the patient at state 348 to grant permission to save the datum to the patient's medical history file and to confirm that the datum is correct. For example, during a consultation for cough, the MDATA system 100 learned that the patient has been diagnosed as being HIV positive. The system 100 will ask. \u201cMay I record the information about your HIV diagnosis in your medical record?\u201d If the patient responds \u201cyes\u201d, then the system 100 will ask, \u201cPlease verify that your diagnosis for HIV was positive, is this correct?\u201d If the patient responds \u201cyes\u201d, then the system 100 writes this fact to the patient's medical history file. After confirmation, each data item is stored in the patient's file in the patient medical history database 268 (FIG. 6).}",

No. 5,594,638, issued Jan. 14, 1997, each of which is also hereby incorporated by reference., 284036=Here the meta function will find the number of complaints involving the gastro-intestinal system between Jun. 1, 1993 and Dec. 31, 1993. For example, if a patient consulted the MDATA system 100 once for abdominal pain, once for vomiting, and once for diarrhea, but each on a different occasion, the system would recognize that these are all problems involving the gastrointestinal tract., 319954=A \u201ctele-stethoscope\u201d 780 is a device that allows the sounds a physician would hear through a stethoscope to be transmitted over the telephone. The tele-stethoscope 780 is functionally similar to that described in the 1992 Arthur D. Little report entitled \u201cTelecommunications: Can It Help Solve America's Health Care Problems?\u201d. The tele-stethoscope 780 permits the MDATA system 100 to greatly expand the spectrum of its sound analyses to include heart murmurs, the bruits of intracranial aneurysms, breathing sounds like the wheezes of asthma and the rales of congestive heart failure, or even the bowel sounds of an intestinal obstruction., 285088=Here the meta function will find the number of complaints of headache that were found to be caused by infection between Jun. 1, 1993 and Dec. 31, 1993., 283699=Here the meta function will find the number of complaints of headaches that occurred between Jun. 1, 1993 and Dec. 31, 1993., 284633=Here the meta function will find the number of complaints that were found to be caused by bacterial infection between Jun. 1, 1993 and Dec. 31, 1993. The problems (complaints) caused by bacterial infection could be in different parts of the body.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the above detailed description has shown, described and pointed out the fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to various embodiments, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the device illustrated may be made by those skilled in the art, without departing from the spirit of the invention. When possible, the MDATA system 100 takes into account the past medical history of the patient, especially those pieces of information learned from past consultations with the MDATA system 100, before advice is given. In addition, the advice given is different depending upon the age and sex of the patient. The \u201cmeta\u201d functions provide another advantage by allowing the MDATA system 100 to evaluate a problem in the context of the patient's prior consultations with the system. An exact record of the questions asked and the answers given is stored in the patient's database. The MDATA system time-and-date stamps the responses to the questions (as transaction records) so that an exact reconstruction of the patient's interview(s) can be generated for use by a physician or other health care professional. The system also keeps a record of what version of an algorithm has been consulted as well as the sensitivity factor set for that consultation. At the conclusion of the interaction, the MDATA system can tell the patient how long the consultation has taken",
