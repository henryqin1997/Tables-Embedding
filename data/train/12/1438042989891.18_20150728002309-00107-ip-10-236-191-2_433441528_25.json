            "System and method for providing digital dictation capabilities over a wireless device - A system and method for providing digital dictation capabilities over a wireless device. The system and method enables digital dictations to be recorded on a wireless device, such as a BlackBerry smartphone, and then uploaded wirelessly to a remote location, such a server, for transcription. Features of the wireless device, such as the display and trackball, can be used to control the dictation.",
            "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR EFFICIENTLY PROVIDING CONTENT OVER A THIN CLIENT NETWORK - A system, method and computer readable instructions for controlling streaming audio in real time in a thin client terminal server environment that can be used, for example, to provide support for a digital dictation system. A server runs client software, and at least one terminal runs a driver which communicates with the client software to create a virtual channel over which at least one digital dictation file is transmitted in packetized format between the terminal and the server, such that the client software controls operations performed at the terminal pertaining to the digital dictation file."
