HHS is currently furthering this goal by engaging in a Department-wide effort to identify ways to make the rulemaking process more accessible to the general public. This effort is in response to President Obama's January 18, 2011, Executive Order 13563, \u201cImproving Regulation and Regulatory Review,\u201d which requires ongoing retrospective review of current agency regulations and encourages federal agencies to develop balanced regulations through a process that \u201callows for public participation and an open exchange of ideas.\u201d HHS's efforts include stakeholder outreach and continuing to update its main regulatory Web page (http://www.HHS.gov/Regulations) with information helpful to the public. For example, to encourage public participation, the Web page includes links to HHS rules currently open for public comment and provides a \u201cregulations toolkit\u201d with background information on regulations, the commenting process, and how the public can provide effective comments. HHS also actively encourages meaningful public participation in retrospective review and rulemaking through education and outreach (http://www.HHS.gov/RetrospectiveReview)., 184103=Abstract: The proposed rule would establish special controls for the computed tomography (CT) x-ray system, a class II device as defined in 21 CFR 892.1750. A CT x-ray system is a diagnostic x-ray imaging system intended to produce cross-sectional images of the body through use of a computer to reconstruct an image from the same axial plane taken at different angles. High doses of ionizing radiation can cause acute (deterministic) effects such as burns, reddening of the skin, cataracts, hair loss, sterility, or, in extremely high doses, radiation poisoning. Therefore, the design of a CT x-ray system needs to balance the benefits of the device (i.e., the ability of the device to produce a diagnostic quality image) with the known risks (e.g., exposure to ionizing radiation). FDA is establishing special controls, combined with the general controls, to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a class II CT x-ray system., 168996=Abstract: FDA is proposing to require manufacturers and importers of tobacco products to submit certain market share data to FDA. USDA currently collects such data, but its program sunsets at the end of September 2014 and USDA will cease collection of this information.
