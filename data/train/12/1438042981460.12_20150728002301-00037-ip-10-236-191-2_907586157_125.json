            "Cal Poly is very strict when it comes to security within the campus. The campus has alarm posts everywhere. These posts are used when you are in an emergency. These posts have a button you can press, that makes alarm go off and alerts the security in the campus. The school is also located near the Pomona Police Department, making it a very secure place.",
            "There are many sororities to choose from. The groups called Greek Life do anything within the campus, whether it is managing parties to having individual group activities. Many people who like to hang around those that are similar to themselves would enjoy being part of Greek Life.",
            "Cal Poly has so many clubs you can choose from. You can always find a group that you are interested in. The groups do activities in the school or community. One of them for example is the Rose Float club, it is a club where you can build a rose float for the parade in New Year's.",
            "Cal Poly is a great place for students who are very serious about their career in the major they are in. The school is known for getting students jobs right after graduation. The campus has a career center which you can go freely to talk to a counselor. The counselor helps you in anything such as helping for a interview or signing up for internship. The center also offers clothes you can use to go to interviews. Cal Poly is very serious in getting jobs for the students they teach.",
            "Cal Poly has the unusual tradition of having a huge campus party after finals week. The school provides grilled foods, and drinks for the students for their hard work in their finals. The school also created a campus wide activity called Zombies vs. Humans. All students can participate Cal Poly also has a very beautiful Japanese garden by their Admissions Office. it is open for anyone who goes there. The garden has Japanese trees and a pond filled with Koi and turtles.",
            "The library has three stories which you can go up with an escalator. Depending on the level of the library, you can choose the level of quietness you want to study in. The library also contains many computers for the students, and research books which are very useful.",
            "Cal Poly has many things you can do because it is a big campus. You can bike, jog, and hike in the hills in the school. There is also a gym students can go to workout whenever they please. The school also has fun activities throughout the year, an example can be Zombies vs. Humans. This is when students chose whether they want to be a zombie or a human, and they chase each other around the campus. Another fun activity is the many groups the campus offers. Individual groups can participate in anything, such as making a rose float for the New Year's Rose Parade.",
            "Cal Poly has great Food and Dining places to choose from. Whether it is fast food, like Panda Express or fine dining like the Sage Restaurants they are all very good. These places are also located everywhere around the campus, making it very convenient. There are many fast food places including fancy restaurants. Some times during finals week, the Denny's in the campus sells their famous Grand Slam platter for only $5. Cal Poly does a great job in there food and dining giving them four stars.",
            "Cal Poly is located on a hillside of Pomona, making it surrounded by farming and wildlife. The campus is surrounded by trees and looks more like a park than a school. The rooms in the regular dorms are very small and cramped. The beds in the rooms are also very uncomfortable, being very thin and noisy. However, Cal Poly has built new dorms called Suites. First time freshmen ,unless your in a sport, cannot use this Suites. The Suites are very nice and is roomy compared the the regular dorms, making them more expensive.",
            "Cal Poly is one of many CSU colleges that follow the UC system, making it difficult and challenging. Depending on what major you choose, the school gives you a Degree Curriculum Sheet containing all the class and units that you have to finish in order to graduate. The classes you need to take contain variety of subjects making it difficult to manage. However, many professors and some academic groups help, whether by tutoring or discussions. You also need to keep in mind that Cal Poly follows the quarter system, which goes in a very fast pace. This pace is difficult to follow in the beginning, but with hard work and rejection of procrastination it is possible. In conclusion, you need to focus on the pace of the quarter system and class requirements.",
            "First and foremost, you need to walk around the campus before starting to attend. Cal Poly has one of the largest campuses I've been to, making it difficult to find classes. Another tip is to bring a bike, skateboard, or a scooter when you attend, because the makes it easier to go to classes. This allows you to get there fast with less effort. Lastly and the most important is looking at your Cal Poly website on a daily basis. The school posts everything that happens around the campus, even personal ones. It is important because there are deadlines to almost anything, and it critical to know what you have to do in time.",
            "I would rate Cal Poly as the number one school out of all the CSU system. This is one of many CSU colleges that follow the same system as UC colleges, making it a challenging and professional. Since it is also a Polytechnic university, it has varieties of majors to choose from."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{178558=I am an African American, and being here made me realize that I am really one of less than 1000 Black students attending this school. It was a major culture shock to see no one in my class look like me, and it is still something I am not used to yet. My advice for other Black students would be to find other black students on campus. Everyone is in the same situation you are in so you don't have to feel alone. Don't only hang out with your specific race, but make sure you can count on them to understand how you're feeling., 322749=Dorm doesn't cost as much as other universities. Can even live in a single dorm for 12000 bucks a year. Also there are buses and shuttles if you don't have a car. And there is many places to see and love., 174124=If you commute, it's roughly $2000 per quarter, and if you dorm, roughly $5000. That's really good, considering that there are so many other schools that are much more expensive, but have the same quality of education. Cal Poly churns out brilliant students and many of them do get hired in their industry because this school has so many great programs. So a top-notch quality education, with a high guarantee for being hired because of the great programs, at only $2000-5000? Why not?, 826105=In comparison to UCs and Out of State Schools the Cal-State Tuition is Very well priced. I'm a commuter, so I don't pay for rent or dorms making my tuition especially low. I think I pay right around $2000 a quarter for Tuition, which comes out to about $6000 a year if you don't do Summer Session. Summer classes tend to be Very expensive because the government doesn't fund us well for Summer Classes. Books are reasonable, if you rent. Rent from anyone, Amazon, Chegg you name it. It's always cheaper than the on campus Book Store. Personally I'm not a believer in the big-name college. So just in general, I'd like to think I'm getting the same education that my friends that are going to UC's are, but at a cheaper price. Also CPP is California PolyTECHnic University at Pomona, which means we're all about hands-on education. For example, as a Hospitality Major one of my classes is working at the on campus restaurant or hotel for a quarter. I'm also required to have 800+ hours of Professional Work Experience in order to get my degree. Cal Poly also hosts job fairs, their own Career Center and an online job board to help you with your resume or set you up with different job opportunities. So if you look at it that way, I think we're just as good as any UC. It's also not about What school you go to it's about what you Do there... That's the big idea., 135358=Though Pomona isn't the safest city in the area ironically I feel really safe on campus. Taking a night class for the first time and getting out between 9:00-9:30 pm I was shocked to see how many students were still on campus. The great thing about having classes after 5:30 pm is that students are able to park in the faculty parking lots which is much closer to the classrooms making it much safer for the students., 702814=Poly Nights, clubs, campus sports, game rooms and looking forward to the 3 level recreation center which will be completed in 2014. Also the Rose Bowl Float is a big event on campus., 665296=Tuition has been steadily rising since I have been enrolled in Cal Poly Pomona and my friend, a junior, has told me that the total tuition for one quarter used to be less than $1000 when he was a freshman...whereas now it is over $2000. Lots of services are included in tuition fees, such as access to the wellness center, but most students don't take advantage of such services anyway. The only consolation for blowing away all of one's money on expensive textbooks, tuition, parking permits, etc. is that the money is going into a college degree., 884390=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 84694=It really is money efficient, tuition is about 2200 for a full time quarter but you take as many classes as you want to (within limits of 20 credits). So you can get done fast and efficiently., 760121=The Bronco Student Center is meant for students to relax and enjoy in between class. This is where our gym is located along with our games room and study rooms as well. There is also about 4 different food places. Opening in Fall 2014 we will have a recreational center that will several other things to do for fun on campus.}",

Also Cal Poly is very affordable at a tuition cost of around $4000 a year. Tips for prospective students Get involved with student organizations and clubs, they will make your college experience full and enjoyable with over 300 clubs, you can find one that suits you, if you cannot find one that is right for you, there is an option of creating it yourself. The dorms are pricey, cramped and old; it maybe better if you were to rent a house nearby with a group of friends or only dorm the first year. EOP is a great program, if you are low income, just read the requirements and check a box when you are applying it gives you some grant money each year, and opens up more a lot",
