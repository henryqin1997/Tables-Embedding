    "textBeforeTable": "Selected molar enthalpies of fusion are tabulated below for several PCMs[3]. Solids like ice which have strong intermolecular forces have much higher values than those like CH4 with weak ones. Common PCMs Substances like Glauber's salt with high latent heats for phase changes are used as phase change materials (PCMs) for energy storage. Glauber's salt is convenient for solar energy storage because it absorbs and releases heat at a convenient temperature (32\u00b0C or 90\u00b0F). The solids to liquid phase change is much more commonly involved, because liquid to gas phase changes occur at higher temperatures and require more storage space for the gas.

    "textAfterTable": "Latent Heat of Vaporization When a liquid is boiled, the variation of temperature with the heat energy supplied is similar to that found for melting. When heat is supplied at a steady rate to a liquid at atmospheric pressure, the temperature rises until the boiling point is attained. After this the temperature remains constant until the enthalpy of vaporization has been supplied. Once all the liquid has been converted to vapor, the temperature again rises.
