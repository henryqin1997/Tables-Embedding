            "The SHOALS airborne system acquires a tremendous volume of raw data during a single mission. The lidar data are unique and require a specialized Data Processing System (DPS) for post-processing. The DPS main funcions 1) import airborne data stored on high density data tape; 2) perform quality control checks on initial depths and horizontal positions; 3) provide display and edit capabilities; 4) calculate depth and position (XYZ) values for each sounding; and 5) output final positions and depths for each sounding.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received topographic files in ASCII format. The files contained bathymetric depth measurements. Some sections of the data were received in NAD27 Hawaii State Plane (various zones), other sections were received in NAD27 UTM Zones 4 and 5. The data were vertically referenced to MLLW (feet or meters). CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The topographic las files were converted from Projected coordinates (State Plane or UTM) to Geographic coordinates. 2. If the vertical units were feet they were converted to meters. 3. The data were converted from ASCII to LAS V1.2 4. All points were classified to Class 11 (Bathymetry). 5. The data were converted to LAZ format.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
