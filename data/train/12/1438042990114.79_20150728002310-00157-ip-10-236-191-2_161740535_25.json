    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{138658=The available data is a bit sparse. For performance metrics, I wanted to use the Fremeau Efficiency Index (FEI) from FootballOutsiders.com. That (publicly available) data only goes back to 2007. FEI is great because it eliminates a lot of noise in the performance data, especially strength of schedule and atypical end-of-half drives. For 2010 I'm using the FEI rankings as of the games of 11/27/10 \u2013 with so few games this weekend I didn't want to wait until mid-week to post this., 141410=So, our dependent variable is the change in the team's FEI ranking for the unit from the last season under the old coordinator to the first season under the new coordinator. We have 359 records (120 FBS teams by 3 years, except since Western Kentucky in 2008, their first year as a FBS school). Here's a quick look at the aggregated results:, 161521=This analysis is far from perfect, and I welcome any and all feedback. I am somewhat concerned that the 'best' firings all seem to be from the 2009-2010 season. Not sure if that's a function of using FEI data from before the end of the season, or if head coaches are paying more attention to coordinator fit, if there are flaws with my coding, or if it's just a fluke., 152239=If you're curious, here are the top 3 best and worst coordinator cannings where the head coach DID NOT change, based on changes in performance year-over-year, from the\u00a0 coaching offseasons after the 2007, 2008, and 2009 seasons:, 158192=2007-2008, 150881=Who knows? This analysis is aggregated, and mileage will seriously vary based on the team and the coaching staffs. On average, given Michigan's horrible defensive FEI in 2010, getting rid of GERG and replacing him with another coordinator would lead to a jump of about 24 points in FEI ranking, while leaving him as DC would lead to a jump of about 12 points in FEI ranking. Whatever happens at Michigan would vary from this weak 'prediction', but I put it out there in any case. The most optimistic scenario, as we'll see below, would be a jump of 75 spots in the FEI., 203811=If you stick a gun to my head and say \"okay Misopogon, you tell me why Hart decommitted right this second or I'll blow your brains all over your precious internet,\" I would say that Dee wants to get his college football career underway at the beginning of January, and Michigan wants to make a decision on who will be his head coach after that. This opinion is entirely conjecture, conflicts with a previous statement made by Hart, and should be taken as no more than that. Expect something more informative and concrete from Brian or Tim later today. Here's Tom: [/Misopogon], 145320=But we have to be conscious of regression to the mean. Coordinators tend to be fired from poor-performing units. The terrible performance of that unit may be due to the coordinator, but it's also likely due to some outside factors, including luck. Just as it's hard to be the #1 team year in and year out, it's hard to be the #120 team year in and year out. So a team that finishes terribly in one year is likely to improve its performance the next year, even if the coordinator remains (if that puts me on record as saying that if GERG stays Michigan will finish better than 104th out of 120 teams in Defensive FEI in 2011, so be it)., 209063=Most people know Harbaugh's records at Stanford.\u00a0 Coming off a 1-11 year in 2006, Harbaugh took over and posted the following records:, 153595=2009-2010, 219677=While Harbaugh did not change defensive coordinators every year because his defense was underpeforming, it should be noted that he went through four defensive coordinators in four years and was still able to find success on that side of the ball in year 4 after bringing in a seasoned DC.\u00a0 His ability to keep a consistent staff on that side of the ball can be questioned just as much as Rodriguez's ability to do the same.\u00a0 This also shows that even with transition you can come out doing well (2010 Illinois is another example)., 202216=In case you went to bed last night thinking that Michigan will be playing in a bowl game, a competent CEO-type athletic director is in charge of the program, and a 5-star-ish recruit perfect for our offensive system will be enrolling in January, you seem to have been 2/3rds correct., 81849=11-18-10 Illinois gains commitment from Tyler Marcordes. 11-29-10 Indiana loses commitment from CJ Robbins. Penn State gains commitment from Allen Robinson. Notre Dame gains commitment from Cam McDaniel. 11-30-10 Wisconsin loses commitment from Makinton Dorleant. 12-2-10 Notre Dame gains commitment from Everett Golson. 12-5-10 Wisconsin gains commitment from Melvin Gordon. Michigan loses commitment from Kevin Sousa.}",
