Usage Guidelines To use this command, you must be in a user group associated with a task group that includes appropriate task IDs. If the user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for assistance. Use the address-family ipv4 command to configure IPv4 address family sessions in EIGRP. EIGRP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can be configured under IPv4 address family configuration modes after first entering VRF configuration mode. All commands in address family configuration mode can be configured in VRF address families except the autonomous-system and maximum-prefix commands. Task ID Task ID Operations eigrp read, write",
