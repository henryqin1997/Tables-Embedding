Delivery is in mid september (plus shipping to Zurich.), 192323=As of 2008-07-03 (exchange rate 0.7505), US$369 is worth NZ$492 and US$25.81 is worth NZ$34.39, 317888=Status: 16/20 at 2008-05-24, 282478=A: I don't actually know, but I hope we can get them before end of August., 251139=ordering 23 July Beware transfers has been done and the group is closed if you don't have enough people to make a 10+ group contact me and we will see if do another one, 182903=After discussion on the talk page, a number of us have decided to place an individual order at Pulster.eu, because they are cheaper than the group sale discount, and they deliver a receipt with VAT. I'd advise the people on this group sale-list to do the same. You can indeed place a group order at Pulster.eu, but that won't lower the price, and would only add extra shipping costs. (from the person who made the group-order to the individual members of the group) MadJo 11:04, 30 June 2008 (UTC), 156769=Has this been closed yet? I just discovered it now and myself and a friend are interested? Ebel 11:57, 22 August 2008 (UTC), 203698=status:GSM 900 variant sold out, new stocks due July 25, 2008, 272869=There is a problem with the GPS in the currently shipping FreeRunners: Mail archive. I already orderd 200 \"10pf NPO 50V 0402\" capacitors for convenient reselling. They will arrive within 10 days from now (2008.07.21)., 259445=Fran\u00e7ois Bianco is trying to create a new group of 10 (will be mostly for French Switzerland). -> The group moved to the EPFL group, which will try to reach 20 persons. --Fbianco 11:42, 11 June 2008 (UTC) Gabriel Ambuehl would volunteer to order the initial 10pack. <- still accurate\u00a0? -> Gabriel will not organize the 10packs for Z\u00fcrich due to not being in Switzerland. We are in contact to find a solution so please wait until we know what to do. Order in Germany (each for himself or as a group, not clear yet) could be as cheap as a 10pack. We are in contact with pulster.de and will be contacted form pulster about the price. We will contact you guys in the Z\u00fcrich list as soon as we know more --Tuxfux.ch 10:26, 6 June 2008 (UTC) Alexandre Ghisoli will not organize the second 10pack, since the order moved in the Lucca's group., 180153=Status 10/10 - Buying via http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=Neo%20FreeRunner, more slots available as they make discounts for buying 10+ FreeRunners. Order will be placed on July 22., 68354=NO Openmoko FreeRunner 900/1800 available anymore (on July 3, 2008 at 21h) as needed in Europe. Furthermore, confirmation: From Pulster.eu: Our sales price is 299 EUR + shipping 15 EUR in Europe = 314 EUR. The idea of \"open\" is ours. So check our price calculation: if you order the FreeRunner from Taiwan, it's 399 USD + 100 USD shipping + c. 90 USD \"import taxes\" inside Europe. Total 589 USD = c.380 EUR. So it will be cheaper and we Europeans have 2 years of warranty when buying from Pulster, instead of a 14 days(?) for imported goods., 262298=Figures accurate as of 4th Jun 2008 from UBS: 1EUR = 1.54USD and 1USD = 1.04CHF., 203552=band: GSM 900/1800, 3G 2100, 276298=Ordered from pulster.de on july 18th., 95195=As it looks right now, it seems that it would be cheaper and easier for us to buy through Pulster in Germany - see the following email: http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-May/017778.html ~leinir, 252017=ALREADY Ordered 18th July (Pulster.de), 258837=1x 10 Pack ordered from pulster for the group Z\u00fcrich!
