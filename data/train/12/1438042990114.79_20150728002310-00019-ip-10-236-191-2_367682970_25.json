Use the IETF form of Frame Relay encapsulation if your device or access server is connected to another vendor\u2019s equipment across a Frame Relay network. IETF encapsulation is supported either at the interface level or on a per-VC basis., 113957=Configures Frame Relay fragmentation for the map class. The fragment_size argument defines the payload size of a fragment; it excludes the Frame Relay headers and any Frame Relay fragmentation header. The valid range is from 16 to 1600 bytes, and the default is 53., 39899=Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a protocol used for carrying packetized audio and video traffic over an IP network. It provides end-to-end network transport functions intended for these real-time traffic applications and multicast or unicast network services. RTP is described in RFC 1889,A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications . RTP is not intended for data traffic, which uses TCP or UDP., 173956=Frame Relay supports encapsulation of all supported protocols in conformance with RFC 1490, allowing interoperability between multiple vendors., 10930=software provides the ability to listen in on both DLCI 1023 (cisco LMI) and DLCI 0 (ANSI and ITU) simultaneously., 34111=TCP/IP header compression, as described by RFC 1144, Compressing TCP/IP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links is designed to improve the efficiency of bandwidth utilization over low-speed serial links. A typical TCP/IP packet includes a 40-byte datagram header. Once a connection is established, the header information is redundant and need not be repeated in every packet that is sent. Reconstructing a smaller header that identifies the connection, indicates the fields that have changed and the amount of change reduces the number of bytes transmitted. The average compressed header is 10 bytes long., 149451=The following configuration provides backward compatibility and interoperability with versions not compliant with RFC 1490. The ietf keyword is used to generate RFC 1490 traffic. This configuration is possible because of the flexibility provided by separately defining each map entry.}",
