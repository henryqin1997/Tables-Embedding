            "There are no Greek organizations on campus.",
            "COOKOUT! Not to far from Gardner-Webb there is a restaurant called Cookout. This place has great hamburgers, chicken, and the absolute best milkshakes ever (in 30+ different flavors)! This place is open super late, usually to about two or three in the morning, which is convenient when studying late. Plus, they give you so much food and it is super cheap, which every college student loves.",
            "Gardner-Webb is located in Boiling Springs, NC. This is a very small town and since the town is so small sometimes the town itself does not provide Gardner-Webb students with a lot to do. The university tries to help with that as much as possible through arranging trips to football games, movie nights on the quad, pancake bingo night, and dances. And if all this fails to keep us entertained, GWU is not far from Charlotte, NC where there is always something to do for everyone.",
            "In the past, the food at the Cafeteria at GWU has not always been pleasant, but it has vastly improved the past couple of years, not only that but there is also a larger selection of places now besides just the cafeteria. These places range from Chic-fil-A, to a cool new hamburger joint, to an Asian food place, or the coolest option of the World of Wings Cafe.",
            "My experience with dorm life has been great! The girls on my halls have been spectacular and loads of fun to hang out with, but they are also there for you when you need them. The resident advisers are always having fun events and programs that encourage bonding with your hall mates and community.",
            "Classes at Gardner-Webb sometimes vary in difficulty. Most of the time the core classes tend to be the easier ones and most major classes are harder. Depending on the major you choose will also depend on class difficulty, sometimes certain classes are harder for certain majors than others. There is plenty of work to do; if you want your degree, you are going to have to work for it. It is usually as hard as you make it.",
            "The best advice that I can give to any new college student would to get out and meet new people and get involved!",
            "There are a few things that make Gardner-Webb stand out. Among those would be the friendly people, the environment, and the professors. Gardner-Webb's environment is so welcoming, and that is not only because of the beautiful campus, it is also the great people. The professors here really take the time to get to know their students and they genuinely care about their students in and out of the classroom."

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I recommend for prospective students that they spend a night or weekend on campus and check out what it has to offer. GWU is great about making the arrangements, you stay in one of the dorms and have a GWU student to hang out with for the weekend. A great way to get the feel of college life, the GWU students and the campus. Bang for the buck The cost of Gardner-Webb is more than a public university but the advantages offered on the campus are worth it. The campus is awesome and provides great places to hang out with friends. GWU is in a small town but there is always something to do on campus or in about 15- 30 minutes you can go to one of the larger towns for more restaurants, shopping or movies. Am enjoying being here I enjoy being at Gardner-Webb because of the people and opportunities I have to work along side my professors and advisers not only in classroom but in the community of Boiling Springs. It has been easy to make friends and become involved in activities as a freshman student because of the mentoring program GWU provides to new students. Am learning a lot",
