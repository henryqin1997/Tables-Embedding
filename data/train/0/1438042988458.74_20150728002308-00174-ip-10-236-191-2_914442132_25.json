Section 1331 addresses set-asides of task- and delivery-orders under multiple-award contracts, partial set-asides under multiple-award contracts, and the reserving of one or more multiple-award contracts that are awarded using full and open competition. Within this same context, section 1331 also addresses the Federal Supply Schedules Program managed by GSA. DoD, GSA, and NASA are coordinating with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the development of an SBA proposed rule that will provide greater detail regarding implementation of section 1331 authorities. The comment period is being extended to provide additional time for interested parties to review the FAR changes of FAR Case 2011-024, Set-Asides for Small Business, to February 13, 2012., 69104=\u00a7 2306 - Kinds of contracts, 79419=DoD, GSA, and NASA are proposing to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to further implement the inflation adjustment of acquisition-related dollar thresholds. A statute requires an adjustment every five years of acquisition-related thresholds for inflation using the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, except for the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute (Davis-Bacon Act), Service Contract Labor Standards statute, and trade agreements thresholds. DoD, GSA, and NASA are also proposing to use the same methodology to adjust nonstatutory FAR acquisition-related thresholds in 2015., 39912=DoD, GSA, and NASA have adopted as final, with changes, an interim rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement a section of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 to enhance competition in the purchase of supplies and services by all executive agencies under multiple-award contracts., 70915=\u00a7 2318 - Advocates for competition, 72706=\u00a7 2331 - Procurement of services: contracts for professional and technical services, 73449=\u00a7 2337 - Life-cycle management and product support, 51251=DoD, GSA, and NASA have adopted as final, with changes, an interim rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement a section of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, to prevent abuse of interagency contracts., 72234=\u00a7 2328 - Release of technical data under Freedom of Information Act: recovery of costs, 68081=\u00a7 2304 - Contracts: competition requirements, 71114=\u00a7 2320 - Rights in technical data, 72382=\u00a7 2329 - Repealed., 69632=\u00a7 2308 - Buy-to-budget acquisition: end items, 9632=DoD, GSA, and NASA are issuing a final rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement a section of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010.
