            "COMPLEXITY REDUCED FEED FORWARD CARRIER RECOVERY METHODS FOR M-QAM MODULATION FORMATS - The present disclosure provides a method of carrier phase error removal associated with an optical communication signal. The method includes estimating and removing a first phase angle associated with an information signal using coarse phase recovery, the information symbol being associated with a digital signal, the digital signal representing the optical communication signal; estimating a carrier frequency offset between a receiver light source and a transmitter light source by using the estimated first phase angle, the carrier frequency offset being associated with the information signal; removing carrier phase error associated with the carrier frequency offset; and estimating and removing a second phase angle associated with the information signal, the estimated second phase angle being based on the estimated first phase angle and the estimated carrier frequency offset.",
            "Blind Carrier Frequency Offset Detection for Coherent Receivers Using Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Formats - Exemplary embodiments are directed to a blind carrier recovery system for blind detection and/or correction of carrier frequency offset between the signal laser source and local oscillator (i.e., carrier frequency recovery) for optical systems employing quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Exemplary embodiments can be implemented using an improved fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based approach. Some embodiments can include a frequency sign detection technique that uses parallel, concurrently implemented FFTs having a modified FFT architecture. Some embodiments can include a frequency sign detection technique that uses time-domain slope detection based on constellation classification.",

The method includes linking the second entity to the at least one agent of the first entity when a trigger is sent by the second entity. Providing one or more software programs over the electronic communication channel to the second entity; initiating an exchange by the at least one agent of the first entity to the second entity. And sending one or more messages over the communication channel between the at least one agent from the first entity and the second entity. The system includes a database containing a link between the agent of the first entity and the second entity. The system also includes a server configured to establish an electronic communication channel between the agent of the first entity and the second entity when a trigger is sent by the second entity. The server is further configured to provide at least one software program for sharing between the agent of the first entity and the second entity over the electronic communication channel. 20100332603 Published Description Patent application number Yang Sun, Buffalo Grove, IL US //]]> BarDraw('2713669',['Patent applications by Yakun Sun, Evanston, IL US'],[[2,4,2,1,1]],['2007','2008','2010','2011','2013'],0); // <script type=\"text/javascript\"> </div> <div id=\"legend2713669\" align=\"center\"></div> </div> <canvas id=\"bg2713669\" style=\"max-width: 500px; width: 100%;\"></canvas> <div>",

The method also includes comparing each of the channel conditions with a first threshold, and transmitting a report to a network entity if at least one of the channel conditions meets the first threshold. 01-31-2013 20130166644 System and Method for Resource Management in Multiple Communications Point Operation - A method for operating a communications point includes receiving a first message from a candidate communications point in a communications points set associated with a user equipment (UE), where the first message includes a resource report advising of an available portion of an upper layer communications resource that can be committed by the candidate communications point in a collaboration with a first communications point to communicate with the UE. The method also includes sending a second message to the candidate communications point, the second message including a resource reservation request to reserve a subset of the available portion of the upper layer communications resource. The method further includes receiving a third message from the candidate communications point, the third message including a resource reservation response indicating whether the subset of the",
