As described above, the present invention can simplify a signaling connection procedure required to provide an MBMS service in a mobile communication system, thereby efficiently providing the MBMS service. Also, the invention simplifies a procedure for providing an MBMS service in a mobile communication system, thereby contributing to a decrease in a load of the mobile communication system. In addition, steps 913 to 918 are applied even to transmission of a downstream MBMS-related message transmitted from the SGSN to the RNC. That is, if the SGSN receives an MBMS-related message from a transit N/W, the SGSN first performs an MBMS identifier search operation, thereby recognizing a related SGSN Service Context. Thereafter, the SGSN forms the MBMS-related message as an SCCP message according to Iu signaling connection info of the recognized SGSN Service Context, and transmits the SCCP message to the RNC. The RNC recognizes a related RNC Service Context using LR_RNC and LR_CN of the SCCP message, and updates the recognized RNC Service Context according to information on the received MBMS-related message. For example, if the downstream MBMS-related message is",
